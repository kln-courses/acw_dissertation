<plain_text><page sequence="1">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES As I have illustrated in three recent papers, the Iliad and the Odys- sey use different emphases in presenting the physical figure of the gods when the divine beings intervene among mortals and are perceived as being there (epiphany). It is difficult to summarize a complex matter in a few words, but I may safely say that the Iliad does not invite its reader to imagine the shape and the form of the divine bodies and does not claim to describe them in their visible appearance, but either presents the divine beings in disguised human figures or covers their physical presence with extreme reticence. With a very few exceptions, the text lets us imagine nothing of the semblance of the epiphanic god. We confront, so to speak, a blank figure. Often the hero recognizes only the voice of the god: this is the only way through which Odysseus receives and recognizes the presence of Athena (II. 2.282, 6 6e ^vve,xE 0eFag 6ojn ()ov0oVTorag, and 10.512). Gods have a special voice that sometimes makes them recognizable even when they appear in disguise. The invisibility of the gods is not an easy concept. It is represent- able by language as the negative speech act that declares that their full manifestation is intolerable for human senses and unutterable. At the sight of the goddess's luminous beauty Metaneira remains without voice (aphthongos) (Hymn to Demeter 275-80). Accordingly, it is start- ing from their invisibility that their visibility becomes thinkable and imaginable, but it becomes so in the mode of its unutterability, in the mode of the unsayable. When in the Iliad the gods are imagined as presenting themselves disguised, they generally assume the aspect of a familiar figure, one that the hero to whom the god presents himself or herself easily recognizes. When the Iliad presents an anonymous disguise, as in 21.285, we know only that Poseidon and Athena look like men (andressi eikten) and noth- ing more. Tie Odyssey practically ignores the technique of the blank figure, and the recognition by the mere voice. This poem prefers the disguised epiphany that is staged in a lavish way. We have Athena in the disguised figure of Mentor, traveling with Telemachos through the Mediterranean See "Epifanie testuali nell'Iliade," "Les figures de la Metis dans l'Odyssee," and "Strategia epifanica e intertestualita nel secondo libro dell'Iliade."

Fur- thermore the Odyssey claims to represent the enarges figure of the gods, that is, their figure in full light, and visible, even when they in fact appear and become recognizable to the hero through a semblance and a disguise. This is the case at Odyssey 16.155ff., where Athena is said to appear only to Odysseus. She is enarges, as the text declares, and yet she bears a resemblance "in her stature to a beautiful and tall woman, expert in splendid handiworks," 6tcag 6' T]LxT yCvaixl Cai TE? sEyaXn TE xacl ayXa eQyac iL6vn. The text adds the theme of the running dogs to emphasize the appearance of the divine, but this divinity is a sem- blance.2 From the standpoint of religious conception, the difference be- tween the Iliad and the Odyssey perhaps signals the Odyssey's larger familiarity with anthropomorphic representations and images of divin- ity. Yet this familiarity goes hand in hand with an ironic recognition that this self-presentation amounts always to a semblance and that the real figure of a god is not retrievable. This familiarity with the disguise of the gods is not surprising in a poem like the Odyssey, a world of deceptions, make-believe, false names, etc. The god with his immortal beauty, maj- esty, and luminous body is other: finally, if divine beings can transform themselves into whatever thing or being they want, no man, as Odys- seus states, can recognize their transformations (Od. 13.313). The divine epiphanies in epos do not have a unique significance, but point to various textual functions and roles. The gods suggest a course of action, and sustain this suggestion with different signs of their presence: voice, disguise, a mingling of the two (e.g., 11. 3.396-97), a 2The verb eiko that is used in both poems to denote the semblance of the gods points to an appearance that is different from their being, and therefore to a deception, an apate, built in their semblance. Even when the gods assume a disguised figure to help their favorites, their figures betray their true being. Yet the Homeric text does not gener- ally comment negatively on this disguise-as Virgil would later do with pathos in Aen. 1.406-9-but seems content to emphasize the continuous presence of the gods to the heroes as a privilege that preempts any negative comment on the reticence of their ap- pearance. Therefore, the tension between appearing and being remains implicit most of the time, becoming explicit only in the cases of overt deception by the gods, as for instance in II. 22.224ff., where Athena cruelly deceives Hector. We have in this semblance and deception the kernel of the Greeks' enduring mistrust of the image, the semblance, the appearance, a mistrust that would become philosophically productive in the fifth century. 16</page><page sequence="3">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES suggestion of their divine nature at the moment of their departure (e.g., II. 13.71-72, Od. 1.319ff.). They may express a gesture of consolation or support to the hero, with different degrees of divine self-exposure (II. 21.284ff.). They may attack a hero, as Apollo assails Patroclos, with a superhuman power that the hero does not perceive, though he is later aware of it, and that the reader imagines more than sees (II. 16.788ff.). Or they may appear in a figure that is recognizable to the character, but a blank for the reader (II. 1.188ff.). When the gods are described in their superhuman power and luminous aspect, they are not seen by the eyes of the mortals (II. 5.864ff., etc.). Only in the Homeric Hymns, though rarely, do they manifest the full presence of the divine persona as being visible-and also confusing-to mortals. As we turn our attention to tragedy we face the difficult question of how the stage can represent, in action and by acting, the divine presence of the gods among mortals. Here no blank figure and no ex- pression of semblance ("they look like . . .") is possible: here the gods must have their iconographic figure, a precise face, a place where they move, their feet placed on some solid ground. Moreover, since they must move and speak, they are impersonated by human actors, and therefore they necessarily have human stature and voice. Aristotle him- self calls attention to the greater difficulty of producing marvelous ef- fects in tragedy than in epic; among these-though he does not mention them-we may include divine epiphanies: "It is necessary to create marvelous effects (thaumaston) also in the tragedies, but in epic po- etry even the irrational, through which the marvelous effects espe- cially arise, is possible, since we do not see the acting character" (Po. 1460a12-18). I hope here to elucidate some of the questions that arise from translating the epic epiphany into the tragic, by analyzing the appear- ance of the gods on stage in Sophocles' Ajax and Philoctetes. I empha- size the following common points: (1) the marginality of these epipha- nies; (2) their formal epic source, and their adaptation into the tragic context; and (3) their function as a sign of what Sophocles explicitly calls "the care of the gods" (melete theon, e.g., Phil. 196). I also empha- size the differences between the two epiphanies, starting with their formal diversity: the invisibility of Athena to Odysseus and probably to Ajax, and the visibility of Heracles to Philoctetes and Neoptolemus. On the marginality of these epiphanies a few words are sufficient. In Ajax Athena opens the action, in a dialogue with Odysseus and Ajax for the first 133 lines of the play. This constitutes a sort of miniature 17</page><page sequence="4">PIETRO PUCCI drama, close and complete in itself, with a final moral or taxonomy (127-33). It functions as a drama within the drama of which it is formally the prologue. The epiphany of Heracles in Philoctetes occurs at the close of the action of the play and radically changes its ending. This final and resolving role of the gods' appearance in tragedy was called deus ex machina by Plato (Crat. 425d) and has been criticized as arbi- trary and external ever since (Plato, ibid.; Aristotle Po. 1454a37-b7). But I am not concerned here so much with analyzing this nomenclature or this criticism3 as with underscoring the marginal position of these divine interventions, which are placed at the beginning or at the end of the dramatic action.4 Marginal placement may signal the relative het- erogeneousness of this device in tragedy and mark its alien nature, as a technique imported from another genre. In Ajax Athena first addresses Odysseus, who is tracking foot- prints on the ground, and tells him to ask her, since she knows. Odys- seus must have glanced around at the sound of her voice, must have recognized it and listened to it without, however, seeing her, for he answers her in the following words: 'Q )90y~[t' 'A90avacg, l)XTlCTrg ~E[toi, OE)v, (d; EvacxOEg oGov, xCv nonzoT g sT , 6two; qVdWtl' axo1co xal VvvagQca.)o 4QEvi, XaXxoor6lov t xd6ovog dog TVQgorlvxfig. (Aj. 14-17) "O voice of Athena, my dearest goddess,5 though you are out of my sight, how familiar is your voice, 3Plato focuses on the deus ex machina's external function in resolving the diffi- culties of the plot: "the tragedians, when they are in trouble about the plot, have recourse to the machine and raise (airontes) the gods" (Crat. 425d). 4 In Euripides' Heracles, Iris' and Lyssa's intervention is sandwiched in the middle of the action so as to constitute a new prologue for the second part of the play. Moreover, it is perceived only by the Chorus, who will not inform Heracles of this divine interven- tion, so that it is played mainly for the puzzlement of the audience. 5Athena's love for Odysseus is traditional in epic poetry: see 11. 10.245, (LXel 6e E IaHctXg 'AOvlW, and 280, vOv acTE talhXoTa CEi LkaCL 'A0rvl . . ; and Od. 3.218ff.: ?i ya6 o' &amp; (g E0XoiL 4tXkE?tv yXkaCvxmc A0rvn, (1g T6T' '6OiUVOijog TE?Qixi6ETo xvcakiXtolo 6gii(p ievL TeWCoor, 60L T&amp;61 aXOC v a&amp;ye' 'AxLoi-- oV y?aQ 7(w i6ov (d6E OsoOg; vaWav6ba qikvvTacg, 6(i Xeiv( &amp;ava4t.v6&amp;a TaQiol(aTO HlnaXkk 'A0rvrl- ?i a' oiTCog E0Ckot E q IXk?tv Xrl60LT6 T? 0i)oVC, XTX. 18</page><page sequence="5">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES 19 that I am hearing and grasping with my mind,6 as that of the Etruscan trumpet with its bronze mouth." Whether Odysseus sees or does not see Athena is a long-debated question; critics have variously argued the necessity of the one or the other interpretation. Today there is a sort of critical consensus that ajronog means "out of sight," though the arguments are not often presented.7 The word does not exclude either "visible at a distance" or "out of sight," for it may signify that Athena is placed visibly at some distance, or, if we give to auto- a privative meaning, that she is not visible at all.8 Once we realize that ajtornTog does not exclude either meaning we have to look for internal reasons to support either one or the other significance. In my view there are cogent reasons for conclud- ing that Odysseus does not see Athena. As I have already mentioned, in the Iliad Athena always approaches Odysseus invisibly and makes her- self recognizable only through her voice.9 Here we have the same sort of epiphany that may have become conventional in the Iliadic tradition for our hero. The epithet for this voice, eumathes (15), could indeed refer-at the metatheatrical level-to that convention and familiarity. 0 6 SUvaotQ (o) q)QEvi is stronger than ovvrmlixL, since it includes the idea of stealing. 7Among the exceptions, see Taplin, Tragedy in Action 185 n. 12, who argues that gods in prologues are always on the ground and that therefore Athena must become visible to Odysseus, who after recognizing her voice turns to her and sees her. But the gods who in prologues speak on the ground are prologizontes gods (Pickard-Cambridge, Theatre of Dionysus 54-55), and this is a different matter, since conventionally there are no humans present. Furthermore, the text does not at all support this double recognition, first by ear and then by sight; in fact it would be ridiculous for Odysseus, after thirteen lines of Athena's talk, to insist on his recognition of her voice if at the sound of her first words he had turned and seen her. The last scholar to write on this matter is, to my knowledge, P6hlmann, "Scene di ricerca" 97, who supports the invisibility of Athena to Odysseus. 8 For the privative meaning of &amp;rTo- see anx6OExog (Chantraine, Dictionnaire ety- mologique s.v. eoodaoaaL) and &amp;jt6Oeog, "far from the gods" and therefore "godless," "impious," and the cases where the preposition has both a positive and a negative sense, as in a&amp;oPXJejto, "to look at" but also "to remove the eyes from," a&amp;joXeyo etc. We may think that something visible only from afar ceases being visible due to its excessive distance-in analogy, for instance, with words like &amp;JT6xoog, which means "put aside" but, by extending to mean "placed fully outside," comes to signify "secret," "myste- rious." 9See my "Strategia epifanica." '?Tragedy knows that the gods may manifest themselves to mortals only through their voices. In Euripides' Hippolytus (85ff.) the young man places a garland either on Artemis' statue or on her altar and then states: "I consort with you and dialogue with you,</page><page sequence="6">PIETRO PUCCI Furthermore, it would be a pedantic detail for Odysseus to assure Athena that he understands her voice well, though he sees her from a distance: the detail ceases to be pedantic and acquires the correct em- phasis if he states that her presence to him is manifested only by her voice." I conclude, therefore, that Athena is invisible to Odysseus. If the Iliadic technique seems to us to be a possible model for this epiphany, we cannot forget that Sophocles had before him at least two texts recounting Ajax' madness: the Micra Ilias, and Aeschylus' Hoplon krisis, the first part of his trilogy including Thressai and Salaminiai. Whether both texts were faithful to the Iliadic model of invisible epiph- any, and to what extent Athena was directly involved in causing Ajax' madness, we cannot know. There exists a fragment of a cup (see Robert, Fiinfzigstes Programm zum Winkelmannfeste, 34ff., with illustration) in which we see some traces of the representation of Ajax' madness. Ro- bert was inclined to think that the source of the picture is the Micra Ilias and argued that the scene shows that Athena and Odysseus are invisible behind Ajax, who is dragging a ram into his tent. If this reconstruction is correct, the invisibility of the goddess would also have been a feature of the narrative in the Micra Ilias. At the same time, Athena's invisibility in Ajax may have a differ- ent purpose than in the Iliad. In the poem, Athena's limited self-revela- tion to Odysseus plays off against her full revelation to Achilles in the first book, implying a series of comparisons between the two heroes.12 In Ajax the goddess does not come to Odysseus to give him advice: her intervention reveals her unlimited, tremendous power (fascinum, mys- terium tremendum) that literally crushes the weak pretensions of even hearing your voice (aude), but without seeing your face." If Hippolytus states this while standing before Artemis' image, his statement that the goddess is invisible is stronger because it implicitly dismisses the image as a form of the goddess's presence and appear- ance. A stage example of Artemis' invisibility occurs at the end of the play, when the goddess appears on the mekhane and remains invisible to Hippolytus. See Barrett (p. 306), who compares that invisibility to Athena's in Ajax. "Jebb says something similar when he writes: "The emphasis on voice and thought-phthegma, ph6nema, xunarpazo phreni-is so strong as to imply that he does not see her even at a distance" (Ajax 13). 12In "Strategia epifanica" I have emphasized the effects of that implicit compari- son. Perhaps Athena's dramatic and full self-revelation to Achilles underscores the im- portance and the difficulty of her task in persuading the hero, whereas her limited self- exposure to Odysseus may imply her easy task in suggesting to him an action that he already wishes for. 20</page><page sequence="7">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES the great heroes. She comes down to show Odysseus how she saved the Greeks from Ajax' fury, how she made and makes of him a pitiful play- thing: she wants this to be known by the Greeks. Hers is a display of tremendous divine power: "See, Odysseus how immense is the force of the gods!" 'Opgo, 'O6aooeV, T eV OCov ioX/iv 6o0; (118). The goddess does not speak of herself, but of divine power in general, hinting at an otherness and absoluteness of power that she merely exemplifies in this specific case. This divine power is not visible in the divine person, but in the effect that the invisible person produces. In other words, Sopho- cles would be using Athena's invisibility to Odysseus in the Iliadic epiphanies to emphasize the invisibility of the divine in its manifesta- tion of power. No epic god ever speaks to one of his favorite heroes with this distance and this edifying intention. To be sure, each taxonomic feature raised here occurs also in epos-namely in the gods' recogni- tion that men are creatures of a day and last like leaves-but the presen- tation of these themes by a patron god does not seem to belong to the epic genre. Odysseus' answer expresses pity for his adversary and also for himself, for he recognizes that before the superhuman stature of the gods, men are only eidola, images, and light shadows: 'OQo) ya&amp;Q fi[ag oU6ev 6vTat a&amp;Xo tkTiv el6okX', OOOtLEQ @ 4b[ev, 1 XOo(6vYv oxtiv. (125-26) "I see that all we who live are nothing but phantoms or light shadow."13 In Homer the eidola are phasmata, oneirata, and psuchai. Phasmata are images that the gods create in the semblance of some real person, as Apollo does in creating a being similar to Aeneas in Iliad 5.449-53; oneirata are images of real persons that the gods send to sleeping people as dreams, and psuchai are images of the dead that are reduced to mere semblance of their former selves. All these modes of eidola are real entities, not mental images: they speak, move, have garments; but they lack consistency, are like phantoms of smoke.14 Odysseus feels like one of those airy entities before the power of the goddess. The disconcert- ing paradox is that the invisible goddess is a solid and real presence; she 13 An attitude of sobering humility is expressed by Odysseus at Od. 13.312-13, after the impressive epiphany by Athena and her slightly mocking remark at 299-300. 141 derive this interpretation of the eidola from Vernant, "Destin de l'image." 21</page><page sequence="8">PIETRO PUCCI really is a power grounded on earth, unlike Odysseus, whom she makes feel insubstantial and makes visible or invisible at her whim. The members of the audience, however, do see the goddess. But what they really see is her invisibility to Odysseus. As I have indicated at the beginning of this essay, the visibility of the gods is thinkable only by starting from their invisibility. Since the gods are invisible, their visibility is representable as a blank, as the unsayable, the unutterable. Accordingly here the audience see Athena, but they see her-whatever image the stage production presented of her-as a sign of her invisi- bility to Odysseus. Her figure is the sign of a blank. Now the question arises, where do the members of the audience locate the goddess on the stage? The conventional wisdom is that Athena is standing at some height, at a station somewhat removed, which would make her invisible to Odysseus and probably to Ajax. She would be located where many dei ex machina are placed-for example, exactly where Artemis stands so as to be invisible to the dying Hippo- lytus, in Euripides' play as Barrett suggests (Hippolytus p. 306).15 If this were the case, I imagine that in Ajax the simplest mechanism was used, one that allowed Athena to rise at some height and distance. We may even imagine that Athena acted on the same ground as the other actors, though at some distance from them (apoptos) and that Odysseus and Ajax dealt with her as blind characters would.16 15 From the same commentary I summarize and transcribe some points of conven- tional wisdom about the position onstage of dei ex machina. From the ancient scholia and Pollux-who speaks of the theologeion, the pedestal from which the deus ex machina would speak-and on up into modern scholarship, the question of how and where the gods appear in these scenes rests largely on hypothetical grounds. The orthodox idea is that the god would appear at some height, "either stepping up from behind the building, or from behind a pediment or the like, or to some sort of raised platform (the theologeion of Pollux 4.127)." The fourth-century writers speak often of mechanai, but we do not know whether they were used in the fifth century, nor do we know what kind of contrivance is meant. "Some kind of crane or derrick" is probable; yet it is difficult to imagine these machines not breaking the desired illusion; nor is it probable that a god merely suspended by a mechani should be kept pendant for anything from 50 to 160 lines. "Alternatively one might think of a telescopic tower on which the god might be raised into sight immediately, behind the stage building" (Barrett, Hippolytus, p. 396). On the static, simple nature of the machinery that assured the tragic epiphanies before Euripides, see Marzullo, "Storia di una macchinazione." '6See, e.g., OT 1325. Some features, however, favor the placement of Athena at some distance from the human action: (1) the mention of her remarkable voice ("O voice of Athena . . . as that of the Etruscan trumpet with its bronze mouth") would be more appropriate if it were thought to proceed from far away. (2) Athena mockingly scolds Ajax 22</page><page sequence="9">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES The epic derivation of the scene is occasionally marked in the text by precise epic reminiscences, if not direct quotations. I have already pointed to the mention of Athena's special philia for Odysseus (14), but one should also add the epic-lyric-tragic 6e6oQxa (1), xcaTvaQLLco (26), OT6Q'UvO (60), xvQEig (87), jrayxQvoog (92), and the mention of Ajax' sakos (19) with reference to Iliad 7.219ff. The most precise allusion oc- curs probably at line 51, where Odysseus asks Athena how it happened that Ajax detained his hand furiously eager for blood: Kai rg s ?JE'o?XE XE@iQta xaLitCoaov (6oov; (Aj. 51) The expression seems literally taken out of the scene in the Iliad where the two Ajaxes speak to each other after the inspiring intervention of Poseidon: xaz 6' tol acTv) 0vu ?t6gV vi OT10jeool 4iXOLOl [takkov q?4)OQIaTaTl X kJoX?L?1V /16e !x&amp;X(EOat, tcaLtcbowol 6' EvveQOe :66eg xal XQE je T ieQ0?E.

(3) Finally, if apoptos implies "out of sight" because of the distance, the word would suggest Athena's relative remoteness; and this placement would suggest to the audience the goddess's distance from humanity. Whether Ajax sees Athena or not is an idle question. Possibly he saw her during the night of the massacre, since he recognizes that she was standing by him (92)-though in Robert's interpretation of the cup she would have been invisible even on that occasion-but he saw her while he was mistaking cattle for men. His senses are therefore completely corrupted and distorted by Athena. Even now, when he comes out at her order, Athena, as she says, has obscured or shadowed his eyes (85, 'Eyd o(xoTco 13() k3 CaQa xai 66boQx6ca, "I shall shadow his eyes, even as he sees") so that he may not see Odysseus. Athena distorts Ajax's sight so fully that, for the audience, Ajax sees only the phantoms she allows him to see. The audience, therefore, cannot decide whether he sees Athena, or believes that he sees Athena, or whether it is at all important what he sees, since all his senses are distorted. Taplin (Tragedy in Action 108) finds a "nightmare element in Ajax's appearance." 17In the other five other passages the subject is aiLX[l (5.661, 15.542), fITOQ (5.670), A'iag (15.742), and 6jQ (20.490). 23</page><page sequence="10">PIETRO PUCCI Sophocles adds q6)ov, partially on the model of such phrases as caiX/i 6E oGTevoQ o L6[loovTo AtcOatctoco a (15.542). The "remake" is not without a tragic violence in the mention of a (6vov that initiates a rhyming of murder (Aj. 55, 61).18 We could therefore suspect a precise "remake" of this text, considering that this dialogue between the two Ajaxes follows the visit of their patron god, Poseidon, who has stimulated their ~tFvog, just as in Ajax Athena has stimulated and directed the furious hand of the hero against the cattle-and detained it from the Atreidae. Another epic allusion could be detected in lines 92 ('Q XalQ', 'A0ava, Xale@, AtoyEV;g TEXVOV, cog ev JtaQOcrFSg) and 117 (TroTo6 ool 6' ()iEtctL, TOl- &amp;v6' &amp;aeC [to o06tjtaXov jTaQeoTUaval), where the use of JTaQiLOTrtL for the assistance and the presence of a god seems epic.19 The allusions to the epic genre in the scene are therefore several and cleverly sustained by various devices: the self-revelation of the goddess to Odysseus through her voice, the philia of Odysseus for Athena, the characterization of Ajax, the occasional "remakes" of the epic language, etc.20 Through the reenactment, that is, through the mimesis of some generic features, the text makes it possible for the reader to recognize the "genre" from which it borrows. The presence, function, and effects of this sort of allusion present us with the question of how we should interpret the relationship that Sophocles' text opens with epic poetry. For Sophocles' text is inscribed within a poetic tradition of which it is both a result and an active agent 18This Iliadic allusion may continue until line 52: {AO.} 'Eyd o(X' &amp;areiOyw, 6uo4)6OouV; Ei' 6pctLaot yv6Cuoag 3akov(oCa TrTS a&amp;vqx?ToloJ xCaQagi, "I detain him by throwing on his eyes heavy images of irresistible joy." The text may allude to the same Iliadic scene and specifically to 13.81-82, where we are told that the two Ajaxes are "full of the battle-joy that the god inspired in their heart" (X6a[Qn y?06ovvot, TnV GoqLV 0E6g ifPactXE Ov9Ut). In our play Athena inspires Ajax with false, maddening images of battle-joy, directing his fury against cattle. Diggle and other editors prefer to make TfS &amp;VXOaFTOv XaQ&amp;ag dependent on 'Eyb oqb' C&amp;riQyo ("I detain him from the irresistible joy by throwing heavy images on his eyes"). The allusion is not lost even in this version. '9See, e.g., Od. 3.223 and elsewhere. 20I am of course referring to the epic text we possess, the Iliad, which in this case is only a sort of substratum for our tragic text, since the episode that Ajax stages did not occur there but only in the Micra Ilias. It is useless to speculate how close or how removed our tragic text is from its immediate source. 24</page><page sequence="11">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES inasmuch as it interprets, transmits, and modifies the Homeric text. It is obvious that in this dialogue between the two texts, in this "fusion of horizons"-to give a hermeneutic conceptual frame to the notion of "tradition"-Sophocles' subjective, intentional purposes are fused with the objective, historical conditions that constitute the grounds of that dialogue and enable an understanding and an exchange between far-removed poets and writings. Besides subjective intentions, we should therefore account for the literary code (though this notion is fraught with problems), for the canon of the privileged authors, for the sentiment of an alienation and of a distance constantly to be dialogued with, for the movement of the past, for the passivity itself of the word. The traditional understanding of "allusion" is too narrow and too empirical to accommodate such a complex horizon of links and connec- tions. For in the traditional view, "allusion" names a "remake" that text B would produce of text A (see, e.g., Pasquali's "Arte allusiva") and assumes that a certain intention of rivalry or admiration animates the author of that imitation.21 It thus establishes a readable authorial inten- tion, a one-way movement, a before and an after. But none of these presuppositions remains stable if we understand the allusion as the "function" and "effect" of a dialogue between texts and historical ages, within a specific genre, through a certain passivity of language. For in this case the subjective motivations fuse with the objective ones. Fur- thermore, "the past" is not a fixed term: it moves and changes with the moving and changing that each interpretation gives of it, so that a pres- ent interpretation changes the figure of the past, and a new interpreta- tion of the past likewise affects the reading that the present gives of itself. This does not mean that authorial intentions do not mark the text, simply that they cannot be neatly circumscribed, or defined,22 since they fuse with other passive or active motivations that construe the 21 See Conte, Rhetoric of Imitation 26: "The instances of 'allusive art' studied by Pasquali are in large part 'emulative' allusions, that is, they refer to cases where the allusion stands primarily in a relationship of 'aemulatio', of competition with and im- provement over the original. ... On closer examination, Pasquali's approach reveals a privileging of the moment of intentionality in the 'poetic memory'. His method creates a substantial opposition between inert material and intentional elements." 22The romantic overevaluation of these intentions brings Bloom (Anxiety of Influ- ence) to construe oedipal conflicts between authors and therefore to contribute to the endless flow of oedipal narratives with their domesticated polarizations, fixed roles, mis- recognitions (= misreadings), fixed drama, etc. 25</page><page sequence="12">PIETRO PUCCI allusion. The effects that allusion enacts are readable-though no dia- critical sign induces the reading of the allusion-in the texts that are dialoguing: these effects may signal the reciprocal recognition of the texts or of the conscious or unconscious use of the conventions that produce both; they may produce a rhetorical emphasis, as a figural meaning, and connotate the text as a textual artifact. By opening a text to the question of its formation, of its textuality, these effects emphasize the literary nature of its texture, its passivity and activity, its similarities and differences, misreadings and authentic interpretations, etc. For in- stance, my analysis of the conventions that control the epiphany of Athena in the Iliadic tradition is sufficient to explain Sophocles' treat- ment of Athena's appearance to Odysseus without needing to find any intentional similarity between Iliad 2.182-where Athena is recogniz- able to Odysseus only by her voice-and the passage in Ajax. The positivistic exegetes of allusion are drawn to it by the com- forting assurances they derive from "allusion": whether the allusion is admiring or polemical, in any case it would consolidate the literary creativity of the text, give instructions of reading, limit the indeter- minacy and the drifting of meaning. The allusive awareness that the text displays would be a producer of sense, would suggest a differential feature that aims at controlling the instability and drifting of the poetic language. Of course these assurances are certainly sought by many authors in the composition of their texts, or at any rate by the monarchic drive of every work, but the polysemy and drifting of (poetic) language re- main inevitable and irrepressible. The simple fact that a new context remakes the linguistic expression proves that the linguistic expression has no original integrity or autonomy. This principle also shakes some of the assurances of the hermeneutic and semiotic interpretations, inso- far as it questions the notion of a "code" as something fixed and stable and thus capable of referential power. Accordingly the interpretation of allusive expressions and texts cannot rely on a confrontation with a "system of conscious and deliberate rules,"23 but may remain sus- 23Conte, Rhetoric of Imitation 31: "In the traditional arsenal of classical philology there exists the notion of an Exemplary Model, the single word to be precisely imitated. There is, however, an alternative model, that is, the Model as Code. The literary institu- tion permits more or less faithful representation, or, in other words, a system of con- scious, deliberate rules that the author identifies as indicators of ways in which the text must be interpreted" (emphasis mine). This code, it seems to me, reintroduces the au- 26</page><page sequence="13">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES pended in a spectrum of alternative, indecidable readings. This spec- trum constitutes a field of expressive forces striving to repress each other. The drawbacks to the traditional notion of allusion being so many, the notion of intertextuality has quickly been adopted by critics, as a new, modern conceptual mean. But the "intertextuality" that has been put in the market by Julia Kristeva (Desire in Language) meant for its inventor a quite different thing than allusiveness, something like the set of the signifying premises of a culture, the set that makes possible the meaning of a text (see Culler, "Presupposition and Intertextuality"). Later this notion was enlarged by Barthes ("The Theory of the Text") and interpreted as the systematic textuality of any text, which is always a product of endless texts; as such it could be employed in poststruc- turalist or textualist analysis as a possible deconstructive tool.24 Within these conceptual coordinates, it is understandable why Athena's epiphany in Ajax presents features that contain and bypass authorial intentions, and why the distortion of its meaning is necessary and irrepressible. We have seen that the invisibility of the goddess is here formally and in content a different business than in epic poetry- her invisibility being actually made visible for the audience, and her invisibility pointing to a tragic vision of man's powerlessness. In epic, on the contrary, readers have less control of the epiphany than does the character, since most often only he knows what he sees when he sees a god. Accordingly this epiphanic theme becomes recognizable as a fea- ture of the epic "genre" at the point where it is oddly performed as an "improper" version of the "original" feature. This fidelity in treason, this identity in the act of becoming different, constitutes the double bind that allows us to think of the generic allusion, and allusion in general.25 thor's consciousness and intention, which Conte, in the previous pages, has so pains- takingly tried to remove from allusive texts. On the inadequacy of demonstrative power of general norms and laws for the knowledge (Erkenntnis) of literary work, see Szondi, Holderlin Studien 263-86. 24I here use "allusion" in the open sense I have sketched, and "intertextuality" either as a synonym of "allusiveness" or more precisely as a "generalized allusiveness," in principle pointing to the total allusiveness of each text. 25The question of how a "genre" becomes constituted and defined for its practi- tioners is too complex to be treated in these pages. The inquiry is theoretically difficult, since it is hard to find the determining traits that define the individuality of the genre, as many features at different levels-nominal, normative, essentialist, contextual-interfere 27</page><page sequence="14">PIETRO PUCCI Even Athena's ground for her epic epiphany to Odysseus, her philia, belongs, as we have seen, to the allusive construction in Ajax. But here too the differences are remarkable. The epic gods descend to visit, advise, help, and comfort their heroes, out of philia, time, and kedos. For philia and kedos see Iliad 1.196 (= 209), where these two feelings prompt Hera to send Athena to stop Achilles from killing Agamemnon: iXkOE 6' 'AOivq o6iav6Ocv- JQO y?a qxcE Oec XevxCxXevog 'HQeq aL4)(o 6O(,uLg OvUO qLXkovUoa Te xq6ouf,vrq T?- (II. 1.194-96) Athena came from heaven: white-armed Hera had sent her since she loved and cared equally for both of them.

Nestor mentions these privileged relations of Athena with Odysseus to Telemachus while the young man is accompanied by Athena, disguised and may contradict each other. It is also historically a difficult investigation: how a "genre" or a "generic tradition," epic for instance, emerges from individual poetic perfor- mances (or events), how their reenactment produces an implicit eidos, notwithstanding both the intertextual contamination and the continuous changes. See Schaeffer, Qu'est- ce qu'un genre litteraire? 28</page><page sequence="15">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES as Mentor. With this intervention, the goddess shows the same care for the son as for the father.26 When we compare these epic expressions of divine care and con- cern to the Sophoclean ones, we are struck first by a certain continuity of words and thoughts and then by a deep difference. As concerns the continuity of words and thoughts, in the Sophoclean texts, including Ajax, the gods' intervention is still prompted by their divine care, de- scribed by tFoXw, iFkqrCa, tEXTTrq. In the dialogue between Odysseus and Athena, the goddess explains that Ajax wanted to kill the Atreidae and the other Argives, and that he would have carried out his plan "had I not taken care," Kav FeegEatcax', ei xcaTqtFelo' ?y6d (Ajax 45). Her intervention, therefore, is prompted by her malete for the Atreidae and for Odysseus, just as her kedos prompted her intervention in the epic.27 We can also consider within the epic coordinates the use of the words (iikaoowo and )LkXw: as Odysseus recognizes Athena's timely interven- tion, the goddess confirms it by describing herself as his vkXaE: KaQiov 6' E')xlS?g.- &amp;Wzvxa yag dT T' orv Rax&amp;og Ta 1' eCoaicTELTa ofI xUv3eQv6atal XEQI. {AO.} "Eyvov, 'Obv0 oei, xcai jzktal (iouXa ep4qv28 -In ofI JrQO6vso9 g Eig 666v xvayvia. (Aj. 34-37) 26For philia and time see II. 2.197 (with Shipp, Studies II 154) and 9.117-18: in both cases the phrase asserts Zeus' philia and time for a basileus, and of course there is no question of Zeus' epiphany. Analogously Hera's recent love and honor for Heracles, in Hesiod fr. 25.32 (MW), does not entail any epiphany. In the Odyssey's popular religiosity "the blessed gods do not love criminal actions but honor justice and the good actions of men" (Od. 14.53-54). The philia of the god for the hero is mentioned in many other cases, e.g., in prayers, II. 5.115ff. (Athena's philia for Diomedes), 10.278ff. (Athena's philia for Odysseus); in short biographical sketches, e.g., II. 5.61, 10.245, 14.491, Od. 8.63, etc. 27Kedos and kedomai are never used for gods' care in Sophocles' plays: the verb announces only human concerns and cares, for victims (Phil. 170), for loved ones (Trach. 966, Ant. 741, Ajax 203, El. 1060), for the self (OT 1061, El. 1327), and finally for those who depend on a leader (Phil. 621). The preference for family concern and care is understand- able as kedos after Homer implies parentage, family alliance, etc. In contrast, we find kedomai only once in Aeschylus (Sept. 137), but it implies divine care and it has a Homeric ring: oav ', 'Aqg, , Erev, et6f, JOt6kV ?Zvuov / Ka6bgo)ov (fCXaov xibeocai T' Eva@Qyog. 28To exemplify the epic use of the notion of divine (vkaXoeLv, I quote from Dio- medes' prayer to Athena at II. 10.291): eg vfvv LOL ?e0EXovoa jraQtoiXno xai &gt;,e 46Xaooe.

But as she is leaving him, and delivering to him her moral advice, she limits and circumscribes the gods' love to only one class of mortals: {AO.} ToL(rtTae Toivvv eiooG)Ov VYJTExoJov Lrtbev JOT' es'Lrn; aiToTg g 0eouig Eiog, tr6' Oyxov &amp;an 1tr6ev', el TLVOg JTXeo ] X?l@ PQ3oi6etg " txax@o0 oTko'Tov Upd3e6. 8 XELQL OL yi xo JIXoOV o1.OVIOV t0ct (); 5itECl XXiLVL T?

Contrary to the Iliadic presumption that the gods love basileis as such, because they descend from Zeus and are the human counterparts of their powers, here the gods love only ToiV5g o4(Qov;ag. With this one word, the entire epic scenario is wiped away.29 For we understand now that Athena's melete is performed only because Odysseus is sophron, not because he is a basileus and her favorite hero as the human counter- part of her metis, as in the Iliad and the Odyssey. We thus have to assume that in relation to Ajax the Atreidae too appear as sophrones to Athena, though there is no indication for it. Here Eumaeus' ethical code (Od. 14.53-54) emerges, rather than the aristocratic view of the Iliadic he- roes. But since in Homer Eumaeus would never have been blessed by the privilege of a divine epiphany, Athena's epiphany to Odysseus insofar as he is sophron is deviant and contradicts one tenet of epic poetry.30 29This (PLXovol (Ajax 133) is the only example of divine philein in Sophocles. Of course men still may call a god philos as Odysseus does, but it is rare. Divine philia is also very rare in Aeschylus' plays; we may cite two occurrences of the adjective philos attrib- uted to a divine being: Agam. 355, 515. 30The different focus on moral excellence goes hand in hand with a different hu- man reaction to the brutal work of deception by the gods. Whereas at RI. 22 Athena can cruelly deceive Hector without raising any feeling of compassion in Achilles, Odysseus at the sight of her tricks feels pity for his enemy Ajax and says so to the goddess. She 30</page><page sequence="17">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES A deep shift has taken place between Homer and Sophocles, within the continuity of their dialogue and of their language. Even the words Et?XeTuq, tFXwco, etc. disclose unprecedented and disquieting as- pects of divine care. On the one hand, gods' care depends on their subjective appreciation of piousness (are the Atreidae, in Ajax, really pious?) and of justice (Phil. 1036-37); on the other, the very nature of this care implies a concern that may not be necessarily favorable (e.g., Phil. 196, OT 377, Ant. 1335, etc.). Divine "care" assumes some myste- rious quality that may intrigue mortals. Yet even so, Athena's intervention in Ajax remains in the wake of an epic scene: its different generic nature may help to explain the auton- omous character that this scene has in the play,31 its being a closed up antecedent of the tragedy and, to some extent, an exhibition of meta- physical awe, alien to the small, realistic world of fear, meanness, and generosity that follows it. Let us now turn our attention to the epiphany of Heracles in the last scene of Philoctetes, in order to define its relationship with the rest of the drama. This epiphany too, like the one in Ajax, has a strong epic quality, even dissonant with the rest of the play. And, like the epiphany in Ajax, it is autonomous in character and encroaches, as an alien dis- course, on the end of the play. We may begin our analysis with the melete of the gods. The expression first occurs at the point where Neoptolemus, responding to the Chorus' pity for the abandoned Philoc- tetes, suggests that all Philoctetes' sufferings are derived from divine care: Oi)6?v TOVTCOV OavacoT6ov [toi.

(Phil. 191-200) realizes it (127) and draws the moral lesson we have analyzed. Euripides, on the contrary, facing some cruel behavior of the gods, would have one of his characters raise the ques- tion of the god's sophia and argue that gods should be wiser than men. 31This point was perfectly outlined by Robert Rust in one of my seminars. 31</page><page sequence="18">PIETRO PUCCI "None of his pains fills me with wonder; for, if I have some understanding, those sufferings which came upon him from cruel Chryse are from divine ordinance, and also the troubles he undergoes now in his isolation from friends are certainly due to the care of some of the gods, so that he should not throw against Troy the irresistible divine arrows till the time comes in which Troy, as the rumor goes, is fated to fall by his arrows." Hidden beneath the expression XeyeTal lies the oracle of Helenus, an oracle that mysteriously emerges little by little, first through the false merchant's story and then through Neoptolemus' last and useless plea to Philoctetes. Because this oracle declares the necessity for Philoc- tetes willingly to assail Troy with his weapons,32 after having been healed from his plague, Neoptolemus can advance some deductions and inscribe Philoctetes' misadventures into a large plan and design of the gods'. However, this oracle never gains enough prominence and authority to convince Philoctetes, who at first pays no attention to it and later discards it on moral grounds. Yet it is this oracle that tangibly embodies Oti)V TOV EUXETTl. We recognize here one typical mode in which divine oracles and divine care operate in Sophocles' drama: they hover over the action of the characters, sometimes ignored by them, sometimes honored by them, and always ready to come down to earth. They manifest the care of the gods for men. In Oedipus Tyrannus Teiresias tells the king that Apollo "takes care" to accomplish the oracle that pertains to Oedipus: 32Schnebele, Die epische Quellen 137ff., correctly emphasizes the condition that this oracle utters, namely that Philoctetes be persuaded and willingly agree to go back to fight against Troy. This condition seems to be a Sophoclean innovation and distinguishes Sophocles from both his epic sources and the tragedians Aeschylus and Euripides (137ff.). In Dio's summaries of the three plays, only the Sophoclean Philoctetes is said to sail willingly to Troy (52.17), while in his general summary of the story Dio emphasizes the hero's unwillingness (52.2), though some editors have needlessly changed the manu- scripts' &amp;xcov to Exd(v. On the way that the oracle emerges in the play, first through Neoptolemus' cryptic allusion (194ff.), then through his explicit narrative (1314ff.), see Knox's illuminating discussion in Heroic Temper (187-90). Kirkwood, Sophoclean Drama 81, explains Neoptolemus' relative ignorance at 194ff. with the suggestion that "Sophocles wanted to stress the influence of Odysseus over him." 32</page><page sequence="19">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES OV y6Q . e [tol gQa JQ5 g ooUy 00 eoev, tEil ixavosg 'AJ6oXX(v c Ta6' [ xjtgcQataL [}XEL.33 (OT 376-77) "It is not my destiny to fall under your blow: Apollo is enough as he cares for accomplishing these things." The oracle is a care of Apollo; it is in the care of Apollo, and it will be recognized by those who now deny it as being accomplished and there- fore truthful (1329-30). The mysterious purposes of some of these ora- cles, their slow, contrived ways of manifesting themselves,34 reveal the perverse and theatrical side of this divine (ELXeTq. In Philoctetes' case the oracle is fully positive and favorable, but the way it is brought to his knowledge and its timing render its message unacceptable to him. The ironic complexity of this situation is that Philoctetes fully realizes that the gods care for justice. He says so in a debate with Odysseus: KaxcC; 6Xkoato'- o6EloO 6' 6' )X68 1TE TOYV avQa TOV6E, 0EOiOLV eli 6iXrg ReXeiL.

A curse on you, who have persecuted me, if the gods care for justice! Oh, yes they care for it, I know it for sure. For you would never have sailed here for the sake of this miserable man, of me, if some divine stimulus had not led you." Philoctetes is right: the kentron, the melete of the gods, is pushing the Greeks to fetch him because they have learned that only he can capture 33The text is variously corrected and interpreted by the critics: see the commen- tary by Bollack. Here the god's melete concerns specifically the realization of his oracle. 34 Helenus' prophecy is revealed the first time to Philoctetes by the false merchant, in a dubious and contrived atmosphere, just as if it were one of Odysseus' sophismata (this word is used at line 14). Apollo's oracle in OT hits Oedipus unexpectedly when he had asked a totally different question, and is finally shown to be true by the account of an old slave who speaks under threat of torture. It is ignored most of the time, and its recognition is helped by such devices and coups de the'tre as the plague, a second oracle, a drunkard's revelation, etc. In Sophocles' drama, the oracle is divine, but it finally imposes its authority through tricks, and coups de thedtre that form a good section of the exciting theatrical plot. Such is also the case with the oracles in Electra and Oedipus at Colonus, and Nessus' false advice in Trachiniae. 33</page><page sequence="20">PIETRO PUCCI Troy. But in his legitimate hatred for the Greeks, Philoctetes too mis- reads the care the gods take for justice: he cannot believe that any justice may ever reside in the actions of the Atreidae and Odysseus. Yet however perverse this melete may look to him and to the audience, it is finally embodied and enforced by Heracles as he appears at the end of the dramatic action to tell Philoctetes the will of Zeus.35 Just as the oracle was meandering, slow, and weak, so the words of Heracles are, on the contrary, direct, immediate, and authoritative. They follow some rare Iliadic models in which the epiphanic god spells down his will in all visibility, with total clarity. The god appears probably at some height, either on the theo- logeion or on another mechane,36 and immediately makes himself known to Philoctetes both because of his voice and because of his aspect: MTilJT ye, jrTlv &amp;v TO()V [tETOTcV &amp;irin5g uO,9v, nail nIoiavTog- ((doxCElv 6' acti6v T/IV 'HQacxXEovg axor T?E xXlEtv XEVOOELV T' OlptV.

I am here, for your sake, after leaving my celestial seat, 35Schnebele (Die epische Quellen 142ff.) forcefully connects the utterance of the oracle with the actions of Odysseus, Neoptolemus, and finally Heracles, and shows how Odysseus misreads it by neglecting its condition-the willingness of Philoctetes-and how Heracles implements it with his appearance. 36Heracles appears at the end of the play as a deus ex machina. This is the only example in Sophocles' extant plays; among the lost ones a deus ex machina has been assumed for Tereus (fr. 589 Radt). Whether a final epiphany featured in Aeschylus' and Euripides' Philoctetes plays is open to dispute: Calder, "Aeschylus' Philoctetes" 177 and "A Reconstruction of Euripides' Philoctetes" 61, has argued in favor of a divine appear- ance in both, but others have recently denied this assumption; see Luzzatto, "II Filottete di Euripide" 21, and Schnebele, Die epische Quellen 137ff. 34</page><page sequence="21">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES to tell you the will of Zeus, and to detain you from the way you are moving on. Listen to my words." Heracles appears in his glorious new status of immortality and invites Philoctetes (and of course the audience too) to recognize the evidence of his divine being: "as you can see" (1420). This means that he appears in such a way that he can be recognized as being a god. As Webster interprets this statement, Heracles appears to be young and beautiful, very different from the Heracles fatigued by the labors and by his final agony. It is difficult to assess how the stage production could make such fine features recognizable; more probably the garb of Hera- cles and his station at a height, in the conventional place of the deus ex machina, might have contributed to the visibility of his new status. At any rate it is clear that Heracles must appear visibly as a god and recognizably as Heracles. The derivation of the main features of this scene from epic poetry is obvious as soon as we analyze the epic diction of Heracles' anapaes- tic part and compare the patterns of a parallel epic scene. For instance, form and content of Heracles' epiphany follow those of Athena's epiph- any in the first book of the Iliad (188ff.), where the goddess prevents Achilles from killing Agamemnon. Notice in both texts the mention of the divine descent from Heaven, the name of the sender, and the will of the god, combined in one sentence: `X0ov EyO Jtyavoovoca T6 o6v ( VOg, cit xE Tir0al, oVQavoO6v- @TQO 6 t' ijxf OfE ia Xe)xdcbevog "HQf &amp;ai(O) 6tCOg Ovu9co 4(lnXovo&amp; TE Xr6boLEV TrE- (II. 1.207-9) T/Iv o/v 6 ' fTxco XQtLv ovQcaviaC i6oQ15g JQokLJtv r&amp; Ai6g Te )Q6ocOV OU EpovXetaTC o o0 xaTeYnvl6ocov 6' 666 iv ov OTkTn (Phil. 1413-16) Of course Heracles has to preface his words with the assertion of his new nature and being, since Philoctetes has known him as a mortal. The epic patterning is obvious in Sophocles' text, and we must recog- nize only by its absence any comforting mention of the divine care and love which in Homer flows from the gods to their chosen heroes. In Sophocles' drama the epiphanic being was a man who had had his large share of troubles and sufferings, just as Philoctetes has, and who paral- 35</page><page sequence="22">PIETRO PUCCI lels his own lot to the future destiny of his friend. The community of suffering that here unites the speaker and his addressee emerges in the place of the care and love of the gods and raises the pathos of the message to a higher level than Athena's. Furthermore, Heracles' mes- sage, coming from Zeus, reveals the Father's concern for Philoctetes' life and destiny.37 Heracles descends as a friend of Philoctetes to bring Zeus' mes- sage; but this friendship is not a sufficient ground to deserve in principle gods' attention and care. Here too, as in Ajax, gods respect the good men, those who are pious, the eusebeis: ToOTo 6' EvvoEi0', O6CV joQ0fTEiT yalav, EioFs{l3 v rTa zJo6 0EOug- ; taCJTta VrLvTa OET?EQ' iYElCTaL JaTCig ZeUg- O V yaQ rqUoE3?La utvv0vaoxEl (3QTOL;g, xav 0ootL xav O6&amp;votv, OvKx ano'kXkvat. (Phil. 1440-45) "Take care of one thing, when you sack the land: respect the divine things, for father Zeus considers everything else less important. For piety does not die with mortals, and among living and dead it does not vanish." The special and privileged relationship that epic describes between the hero and his god is lost here too. No man per se deserves more divine care than another, and no one gets this care if he is not eusebes. The formal aspects of similarity between the epic and the epi- phanic scene in Philoctetes are enhanced by the epic features of the diction.38 Heracles defines the words he is going to utter as muthoi. In the whole play this word muthos is used only three times and only to denote the words of Heracles (1410, 1417, 1447). The arguments that Philoctetes and Neoptolemus exchange until the appearance of Hera- cles are consistently called logoi (1393, 1395, etc). Muthos is always a special logos in Sophocles: it carries sacred connotations, as in prayers and oaths (El. 50) and insults (Aj. 770); it hints at inflated and men- 37Segal, Tragedy and Civilization 348, splendidly highlights Heracles' phrase Tiv oIv 6' fX(o y,a6Lv ("I am here for your sake," 1413): "Philoctetes will go to Troy, but not at the order of the Greek generals, not even as a result of human persuasion. He will obey only the divine voice that comes to him personally for his sake (1413) from Olympus." 38 On the language of Heracles see the observations by Segal, Tragedy and Civiliza- tion 348, 351-52, and passim. 36</page><page sequence="23">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES dacious words (Aj. 189), proclamations, edicts (Ant. 11), edifying stories (OC 1581), etc. The verb a&amp;o is an epic reminiscence and is used by Sophocles mostly in lyric and anapaestic utterances, twice in trimeter but with a special emphasis.39 What Philoctetes and Neoptolemus (and of course the audience) are listening to is not the utterance of tragic logoi, but a divine, epic mythos.

We should ask ourselves why is it that the text comes so close to repeating the design of the epic epiphany, while throughout the play the criticism of the epic ethos, characters, and telos has been so continu- ously and bitterly pronounced.40 The answer should be articulated within the context of the generic deviation that the order of Heracles produces from the tragic action. When Heracles appears, Philoctetes had long since resolved and persuaded Neoptolemus to give up the heroics of the Trojan War and to return home. The epic world has appeared to them utterly corrupt, and because of its violent, deceitful, unscrupulous ethos its life of glory has become for them a disgraceful sham. Their decision to return home means a refusal of that equivocal glory and a renunciation of the perverted values of the epic world, of the world tout court. Heracles' injunction to Philoctetes to join the Trojan War forces the tragic action to switch back and to retrieve the life and thought patterns of the epic world and its narrative. Accordingly Hera- cles leaves aside the questionable issues arising in the play and enjoins Philoctetes to make his life glorious (1422, e'UxXea 0oeacL O(3ov) by what he has suffered and by his heroic deed.41 The epic epiphany signals the switch from tragedy to epic, from a bitter view of the business of life to its trusting acceptance, and from the neglected voices of the oracle to the powerful presence and word of the god. Simultaneously, the epiph- any signals the unpredictability and arbitrariness of this switch. Some- 39Ajax 1263: Agamemnon boasts of not hearing/understanding Teucer's barbarian language. OC 304: Theseus will hear, listen with care to the story about Oedipus. 40The most impressive moments and themes of this criticism are Neoptolemus' resistance to Odysseus' seduction, the dialogue between Neoptolemus and Philoctetes about the exclusive survival of the kakoi in war, and Odysseus' expediency and final defeat. 41 Neoptolemus in his final plea had invited Philoctetes to the same goal (1347), but Philoctetes had deemed that goal impossible in the world of the kakoi. For he had said that it was not his anger at the past villainy of the Atreidae that now detained him, but the notion that the mean nature of the actual leaders could only produce new villainy. 37</page><page sequence="24">PIETRO PUCCI thing external and alien to the tragic world creates a wishful, utopian effect of language (stage, representation, etc.) and an ideological twist. It is as though it were not possible within the terms of the tragic logos to give a justification or a favorable account of the world in general unless by recourse to the epic mythos. Alternative ways to read the epiphany would consist in glossing over the alien aspect of the epic switch. In fact, in the history of recent criticism readers have tried to harmonize Heracles' message with Philoctetes' own state of mind, so that the epiphany does not descend on him as an external decision. One common manner of approach has been to assume that the generous and powerful plea of Neoptolemus has not left Philoctetes unaffected and that Heracles' words simply continue and conclude a process that had already begun in the hero's soul. This reading relies on weak textual marks (1350-51, 1466),42 and especially on the wishful desire and well-meaning disposition of the reader. More frequently, and more interestingly, it has been implied that Philoctetes' self-righteousness leads him astray from the ethical codes of both tragedy and epic. His relentless hatred, even after his own recognition that the gods desire him to be cured and to take up arms against Troy (1035-39), and his implacable stubbornness, even in face of the explicit oracle (1348ff.), would make of him an impious man, and Heracles' appearance would constitute a salutary intervention to bend him and to make him eusebes, respectful of the gods. But even that interpretation would not produce a real coherence between Heracles' appearance and the tragic tenets of the play. For in this line of interpretation the tragic issue would entirely focus on the problematic aspects of eusebeia, that is, of the religious respect and piety that the gods demand from men. For if eusebeia, as Heracles argues, is the single virtue honored by the gods, Odysseus acts all through the play as the champion of this virtue, and Philoctetes as the villain. This characterization of Odysseus as champion of eusebeia is unsavory and unconvincing, because Odysseus asserts his pious com- pliance with the gods' desires by means that are repulsive to men of noble and pious standing, such as the young Neoptolemus.43 If, then, Odysseus is not a champion of eusebeia, and Philoctetes is not a villain, 42Among recent scholars who have upheld this view see Hosle's eloquent argu- ments, Die Vollendung der Tragodie 141ff. 43He would also neglect the letter of the oracle, according to which Philoctetes should be persuaded and not forced to go to Troy. 38</page><page sequence="25">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES the play struggles with a conflicting and problematic notion of eusebeia. Certainly Heracles' injunction eliminates this tragic notion of eusebeia and reduces it to simple and straight ideas: either respect for sacred things and ritual observance, or the absolute subordination of men to the inscrutable plans of the gods, or both. In this last case, Philoctetes' sufferings receive a hard legitimization, but a legitimization neverthe- less. The "generic" switch which I am emphasizing would correspond to an ethical and religious switch: the will of the gods is unfailing and not optional, as the oracle gave occasion to believe, and the words of the gods are coming directly from their mouths, clear and unambigu- ous, contrary (again) to the logoi of the oracle. This switch underscores the different media through which gods communicate to mortals in epic and tragedy. In epos, gods manifest themselves and declare their will. In Sophocles' tragedy, the divine melete manifests itself in labyrinthine oracles, often forgotten and reac- tivated by theatrical events, with no distinguished attributes, no author- itative evidence of truth: they seem to be ruled by the vagaries of tukhe or of sumphore, appearing and disappearing on the crest of accidental events.44 Such is the case in Philoctetes. Odysseus' knowledge of the necessity of Philoctetes' bow if the Greeks are to conquer Troy (113ff.) comes from Helenus' oracle; and yet, he seems to have misread it, since he behaves (1054ff.) as if he had not understood that Philoctetes must come to Troy through persuasion (612-13).45 Also, Neoptolemus' confi- dence that Philoctetes' misery is due to the divine melete is inscribed in a vague "people say" (195ff.) which seems to comprise Helenus' oracle. When at the end the oracle is reported by Neoptolemus with due em- phasis and respect, it is simply a logos that Philoctetes should inscribe in his mind-as though, among all the false logoi and half-baked truths which have been concocted for him, another logos would really make any difference. The labyrinthine nature of the Sophoclean oracles also becomes evident in another term and notion that I have not yet addressed: tukhe, "chance" or "fortune." Divine care (melete) is sometimes represented as divine fortune or chance (theia tukhe), a notion that imbues the provi- dential care of the gods with some ambivalent and disquieting tones. In 44See my Oedipus 30-41, 52, 140; and Segal, Tragedy and Civilization 242, where he equates Sophocles' oracles with riddles (aenigmata). 45On this point see Bowra, Sophoclean Tragedy 267ff., who notices that misread- ing of oracles is a Sophoclean trait, and Hosle, Die Vollendung der Tragodie 137. 39</page><page sequence="26">PIETRO PUCCI his most pathetic plea to his friend, Neoptolemus attributes Philoctetes' suffering to theia tukhe: IV y?1 vooesg o66' akyog ex 0etiag TXr1X XQ0rlJSg JTeXco0?eo' q)6XaExog, 6g TOV &amp;xaXv4)q orlxov (vuX&amp;aost x@QU4lOg oixoVQ@cV c4)Lg. (Phil. 1326-28) "You suffer this pain from divine fortune, since you approached the guardian of Chryse, the hidden snake that guards and protects the roofless sanctuary." We find here a specifically tragic term that defines gods' will in an enigmatic way, for at the time when Sophocles wrote Philoctetes the expression theia tukhe sounded either ancient or somehow uncommit- ted, as in this period tukhe began to assume a secular connotation of "event," "accident," "chance," "destiny," and the like.46 Here the ex- pression refers to the bite of the sacred snake, guardian of the sanc- tuary. This tukhe is divine, and it hides the reason and the logic of the events. In Neoptolemus' previous lines, 'Av0gctroQ oi r;g [tLev ?X OECrv / TvXug 6o0eioag eiT' avayxalov (p)E?tv (1316-17), "It is necessary for men to withstand the ill fortunes given by the gods," the tukhai are the sufferings of Philoctetes and are denoted as events produced by the gods and therefore inevitable.47 In his previous statement (196), Neop- tolemus had termed this tukhe from the gods, the melete of the gods, their care and concern: we measure here the contiguity and the differ- ence between the two terms. After all the excruciating experience of assisting and persuading Philoctetes, Neoptolemus is no longer sure that his friend's sufferings are really caused by a divine care, and pre- fers a less committed expression. His thought now rings close to He- 46Though accidents may often be said to be a godsent tukhe (cf., e.g., Eur. El. 890), this denotation of ill fortune (sometimes good fortune as in Soph. OC 1505-6) implies a certain inexplicability of the event and the impossibility of avoiding it (see Soph. fr. 201f Radt, Eur. HF 309-10). For the suggestion that tukhe may be autonomous from the gods cf. Eur. Cyclops 606, and for examples of tukhe with secular and even skeptic connota- tions see Soph. OT 977 and my Oedipus 96. Aeschylus would give this divine chance another name, kaka (Suppl. 211) or pemonai, "sufferings" (Pers. 293-94). Euripides too uses the tukhe terminology: see Busch, Untersuchungen. 47Heracles had to die before he could learn that the tukhai he endured and the ponoi that he labored through granted him at the end the immortality that now he shows to Philoctetes. In an analogous way, Heracles suggests to Philoctetes that his miseries will gain him a glorious life (1418-22). 40</page><page sequence="27">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES 41 rodotus', when he spoke of the incomprehensible interventions of the gods.48 With the appearance of divine tukhe, the metaphysical horizon under which the Sophoclean hero usually suffers is completed. He acts, errs, and suffers in the space of tension that emerges between divine melete (which can also be called divine tukhe) and human tukhe, be- tween the will of a divine guardian snake and the will of the human commanders, between the divine oracle and its messy human inter- pretation. There would be no resolution to this utter tension and confu- sion unless the clear voice of the god would appear in the striking epiphanic scene. However retouched by the tragic context, Heracles' mythos car- ries heavy epic connotations and therefore constitutes a harsh switch from the language and the action that precedes it. The measure and the ideological nature of this switch have been variously assessed by crit- ics. It has been often suggested that Heracles' message, by forcing Philoctetes to join the world of corrupted values, proves the villainy of the world and the distance of this world from the hero.49 Alternatively the message of Heracles would reestablish order and would give mean- 48Cf. Darbo-Peschanski, Le discours du particulier 61: "I1 leur [aux dieux] arrive d'intervenir dans le monde humain sans avoir ete provoques a le faire, de maniere absolu- ment autoritaire et injustifiee." Of course we would expect a different emphasis in Neop- tolemus' words: namely that when he tries to persuade Philoctetes of the oracles' mes- sage, he would use the strongest words in the Greek language to speak of the care, of the love of the gods for men. But he cannot: these words would probably sound like a sinister mockery in reference to the suffering and the mistreatment that Philoctetes has received. 49The play would thus show the immoral and corrupt status of the world, and accordingly the paradox of the divine injunction that forces Philoctetes both to neglect it and to participate in its deeds, remembering to eusebein the gods. This is, in the main, Reinhardt's view of the play. He reduces the force of the paradox by assuming that Philoctetes is limited by his private vision and blind to the total view of the world that the gods possess. Philoctetes' tragedy is the absurd separation of man from the course of the world, of the part from the totality. An astute and subtle argument against Reinhardt's interpretation is that of Schmidt, Sophocles Philoktet 246-47, who shows that divine will is finally not enacted through kakoi; on the contrary, the gods forbid this to happen. The success and impact of the villains (kakoi) are broken with Odysseus' defeat, and their help is revealed as a false appearance. Furthermore, even before Heracles' epiphany Philoctetes has already gained the friendship of Neoptolemus: all alone he has emptied Odysseus' plan and succeeded in drawing the young man to his side. Accordingly, as Schmidt argues against Reinhardt, the world is not as Philoctetes sees it. This is powerful reasoning and reading. Yet the friendship of Neoptolemus and Philoctetes is not sufficient to limit and control the kaka that Philoctetes imagines the Atreidae will continue to accomplish.</page><page sequence="28">PIETRO PUCCI ing to the trials of the hero. This is the normal experience of the Sopho- clean hero.50 I tend closer to the former view, but from a different angle. In this essay I have elaborated some arguments that may be sum- marized in two points. (1) The epiphany in Philoctetes is a last-minute resort by the gods to salvage a plan that misfired. In this connection the mekhane of Heracles' epiphany is just like an Odyssean sophisma. (2) Heracles' injunction produces an order and a meaning that are not coherent with the tragic premises, since they come from outside, as a language that is external to the world in which the events have occurred. The hero, therefore, does not receive any real explanation and cannot initiate the process of accounting for and absorbing the experience of his past suffering and blindness. These points need further explanation. (1) The divine origin of Philoctetes' wound remains mysterious,51 and the oracle wanders around carried by various mouths; while it grows larger in its last ac- count, it remains unheard.52 The mekhane of Heracles' appearance makes the will of Zeus unescapable, but has the quality of a trivial contrivance and, metatheatrically, of a coup de theatre.53 The gods must realize the inefficiency of their oracle and must find some new way to communicate their melete. The epiphanic device shows the complexity of Sophocles' art, for it leaves the audience with a double impression: the appearance of the god produces an awesome, numinous presence on the stage and simultaneously enacts a cheap theatrical trick, which Euripides had used many times to close his plays. 50Segal, Tragedy and Civilization 352, defines this experience perfectly: "As we have seen elsewhere, it is the task of the Sophoclean hero to recognize that his life has shape and place in some larger order that he must fulfill. In the perception and free acceptance of his role in that pattern lies one of the essential qualities of Sophoclean heroism." 51 Sophocles does not give any motivation for the wound; other sources imply that the biting was due to Hera's rage against Philoctetes for having lighted Heracles' pyre; see Dum6zil, Le crime des Lemniennes 39-40. Modern interpreters tend to consider Philoctetes' wound as symbolic of his monstrous isolation, and since the bow would represent his greatness, bow and wound together would intimate the suffering and loneli- ness of the great hero; see, e.g., Hosle, Die Vollendung der Tragodie 129-30. 52It comes from a seer who is an enemy of the Greeks and whose motivation is never clear. See, by contrast, the friendly oracle by Calchas, after the teras of the snake, in II. 2.284-332. 53This contriving quality explains why some critics have felt justified in assuming that there is no epiphany of Heracles, but only an intervention of Odysseus disguised as Heracles. 42</page><page sequence="29">GODS' INTERVENTION AND EPIPHANY IN SOPHOCLES The inefficient complicity between human and divine tukhe, be- tween human contrivance and divine melete, seems to me the real scan- dal of the world as staged by Sophocles in Philoctetes. The play is the staging of human and divine confusion. The divine order is, simul- taneously and without difference, human disorder. Accordingly, Sopho- cles' writing spins together in the same language a message which, as an oracle, is both a divine muthos and simultaneously a human, drifting logos. They are indistinguishable until the oracle is proved to be truthful and inevitable by the god himself speaking out. (2) The novelty of Philoctetes is that the oracle does not prove its truth and inevitability by itself, within the coordinates of the tragic action, as in the other Sophoclean dramas. No, here it must be salvaged from the confusion, inefficiency, and contrivance of human language and motivations by a divine intervention whose generic style and nature contradict the tragic action. The "generic" switch produces an external gesture toward a metaphysical order that should provide meaning to the whole action. "External" is intended here in the same sense in which it could be said that "tragic irony" is external; that is, it is identifiable as an effect of language external to the subjectivity of the characters. They cannot read it, and when finally they find themselves where the tragic irony of their language always suggested to the audience that they al- ready were, even then they fail to recognize that their language always knew it. Analogously, though on a different level, Heracles' order is produced by a representation that is alien to the "logic" of the oracular medium, a logic that avoids just the personal manifestation of the god. Philoctetes accepts Heracles' appearance and Zeus' order as something that comes from elsewhere than his language, experience, and persua- sions. For him the epiphany is the desired return of the friendly voice, of a friend, however, to whom he can no longer say anything and ask anything: in three short lines he simply acquiesces in the order.54 54The "tragic hero" in Sophocles is the character that finally recognizes his blind- ness to the divine melete and to its language and considers himself the test and the monument of this divine (dis)order. Oedipus recalls his trials and recognizes the unique- ness of his standing up to them (OT 1414-15). Ajax too considers himself in light of his blindness to divine will, but he cannot sustain that defeat and kills himself. Philoctetes has no time and way to measure Heracles' message within the tragic consciousness that he has already gained when he is reflecting that he is the only man able to stand the horror of his life (536-38). Of course, as soon as the hero accepts the privilege of being the "sign" of the divine melete he begins to see himself as unique and heroic and accordingly risks overstepping human limits and dangerously approaches hubris (1440ff.). 43</page><page sequence="30">PIETRO PUCCI For the audience, the outwardness of such a language sounds literally as another "genre," another muthos, a different eusebeia than those presented during the tragic action. The audience, therefore, won- dering at the outgrowth of this alien language, may realize its expe- diency and its purpose in channeling the action into its traditional order and course. They may fix their attention on the epic use and abuse of the machinery and consider the various facets of this literary artifact. Simultaneously, the extraordinary peremptoriness of Heracles' appear- ance communicates a sense of divine urgency. The audience may also feel, in the wake of the epic epiphanies, the power of the numinous. This foreign character of the epiphany may suggest that in Sophocles' writing this explicit metaphysical language does not penetrate the world, does not compound with its language-as the language of the oracle does-but remains an alien language. It resounds from an "else- where" that could be a "nowhere," a mere poetic space, alien to this one of tragedy. And yet, though alien, this divine, direct language is hopefully there, and may come-as it does in other generic representa- tions of the divine-someday, from somewhere, if it is not too late.
