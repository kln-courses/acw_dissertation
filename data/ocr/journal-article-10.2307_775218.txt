Rembrandt van Rijn, Supper at Emmaus, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard Uni- versity. in commening upon this acquisition, Seymour Slive writes: "The drawing depicts a passage from Luke (24:30-31): 'And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him. . . .' There can be no question that Rem- brandt studied this brief passage frequently. It was one of his favorite Biblical themes. He represented it during every phase of his career. The sketch can be dated in the early 1630's, not long after he painted the same subject in the little panel now at the Muste Jacquemart-Andr6 in Paris. It is an outstanding example of young Rembrandt's dramatic power of conception and his originality as a draughts- man." Professor Slive makes the point that while one-quarter of the paintings attributed to Rembrandt are in the United States, most of them are portraits, and his Biblical paintings are hardly represented. Therefore, Supper at Emmaus is not only an important addition to the Fogg's Rembrandt collection, but to the body of his work existing in the United States. Fig. 8.

The collection of 252 paintings includes works by Charles Burchfield, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Wil- liam Glacken, Arshile Gorky, Adolph Got- tlieb, Morris Graves, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Milton Resnick and Mark Tobey. The University has persuaded Richard Hirsch, director of the Allentown Art Museum and curator of the James A. Miche- ner Foundation Collection, to join the Art Department staff at Austin as special curator of art and curator of the Michener Collec- tion, and the generous loan program insti- tuted at Allentown will continue. Mr. Hirsch will be chairman of a subcommittee on acces- sions from art produced in the United States and to be purchased from funds provided for that purpose by the Michener Foundation and friends as part of the gift to the Univer- sity of Texas. Responsible to Chancellor Harry Ransom, administrative head of The University of Texas System, will be a System committee on the arts of the Americas which will concern itself with research and publication, acces- sions and teaching. This committee will be headed by Professor Donald B. Goodall, di- rector of the University Art Museum and chairman of the Department of Art. Subcom- mittees on arts from the United States, from Canada and from Latin America will be di- rected, respectively, by Mr. Hirsch; Mort Bar- anoff, associate professor of art, and Alan Y. Taniguchi, dean of the School of Architec- ture. To assure the widest possible student audi- ence, the Michener Collection will be housed in a new building to be constructed for the Humanities Research Center of which Profes- sor F. Warren Roberts is director.

There are important runs of periodicals and multi-volume sets, a large proportion of which are no longer obtainable. WISCONSIN STATE UNIVERSITY-EAU CLAIRE has received within the past year a number of works as a gift from Mr. Emil J. Arnold of New York City and Provincetown. It is, for the present, on exhibit in the Sky- lite Art Gallery and in various University of- fices, but upon completion of the Fine Arts Center, now under construction, it will be housed in galleries designed especially for it and future acquisitions. Several works in the Arnold Collection were given by friends of Mr. Arnold, Benjamin Weiss and Chaim Gross. The University has published a brochure on the Collection with thirteen il- lustrations, eight of them in color. Among the works illustrated are drawings by Rice Pereira and Chaim Gross and oils by Karl Knath, Taro Yamamoto, Peter Busa, and Mahler B. Ryder. The Georgia Museum of Art at the UNI- VERSITY OF GEORGIA has received from ART JOURNAL XXVIII 2 202</page><page sequence="9">the International Graphic Arts Society, Inc. about 30 prints by contemporary artists, among them Margo Hoff, Richard Ziemann, Anthony Gross, and Maki Haku. Georgia has also acquired as gifts of the artist and the Friends of the Department of Art and Museum Purchase 63 works by Howard Cook, mostly ink drawings, of scenes of World War II in the South Pacific battle area. DENISON UNIVERSITY has acquired about two hundred Burmese pieces, gifts of Miss Ann Rohrer, Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Young, Mr. and Mrs. Abbot Low Moffat, and others. Major items include two Moulmein or Moulmein-type Buddhas, a dancer in court costume in polychromed carved wood, a two frog bronze Shan drum with base and Pongyi chest. Denison has also acquired more than twenty modern American prints by such art- ists as Josef Albers, Alexander Calder, Roy Lichenstein, and Robert Rauschenberg. AMHERST COLLEGE has acquired seven oil portraits of members of the Amherst fam- ily, including a portrait of Sir Jeffery Am- herst by Sir Joshua Reynolds, a portrait of Sarah Hickman Amherst by Sir Thomas Law- rence, a portrait of William Pitt Amherst by John Hoppner and works by Francis Cotes, Robert Edge Pine, Allan Ramsay and Rich- ard Wilson. A collection of 85 Indian minia- tures has also been acquired by the College. The entire Light7 exhibition of photo- graphs (see "other exhibitions," in this issue) including archival-quality prints of 85 photo- graphs by 75 photographers such as Ansel Adams, Lotte Jacobi, and Jerry Uelsmann is an acquisition of the Hayden Gallery, inau- gurating the MASSACHUSETTS INSTI- TUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Permanent Col- lection of Photography and a biennial series of photography exhibitions. THE MUSEUM PURCHASE FUND COL- LECTION, was established in 1953 by Gloria Vanderbilt to encourage the contemporary artist through the purchase of his work for a public collection. Now sponsored by the Aline Rhonie Fund, the collection consists of twen- ty-four paintings in an exhibition circulating under the auspices of The American Federa- tion of Arts. Four paintings are acquired each year from artists who are residents of the United States and who, in the opinion of those who make the selection for the Fund, have not had adequate recognition. Each year two art professionals from various Amer- ican cities are invited to make the selections. As new works are added, others are withdrawn and distributed, on request, to institutions that have shown the exhibition during the preceding year, and which have permanent collections that include contemporary art. This year, the following four paintings are being distributed: Cameron Booth, Predominantly Red (Se- lected by Martin Friedman) to The Midland Art Council, Midland, Mich. Roy De Forest, The Last Time I Saw Boise, Idaho (Selected by Paul C. Mills) to Stout State University, Menomonie, Wisconsin. Stephen Pace, 55-26, (Selected by Martin Friedman) to Weatherspoon Art Gallery, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, N.C. James Weeks, Double Portrait with Dog (Selected by Paul C. Mills) to Museum of Art, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut. Tom L. Freudenheim, Assistant Director, University Art Museum, University of Cali- fornia at Berkeley and Edward Weeks, Execu- tive Assistant to the Director, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, have selected paintings by Robert Bechtle, Gerald Gooch, Richard Anuszkiewicz and John W. McIvor respec- tively which will be added to the exhibition this year. SMALL PAINTINGS FOR MUSEUM COL- LECTIONS, an exhibition established in 1966 by Mrs. McCauley Conner, in memory of her father Barklie McK. Henry, has a two- fold purpose: to encourage the contemporary artist through the purchase of his work for a public collection and to encourage institu- tions to collect contemporary art. The exhi- bition has been circulating throughout the United States under the auspices of The American Federation of Arts since September, 1967. Each institution that displays the exhi- bition receives a painting for its collection. Twenty-seven paintings comprise the exhibi- tion. Each year three persons in the art field from different geographical areas throughout the United States are invited to purchase three small paintings, under 42 inches in- cluding frame, by three different artists who have lived and worked in the United States and who in the opinion of the selectors have not received adequate recognition. This year, the following nine paintings will be distributed as follows: Bengston, Billy Al, Untitled (Selected by Maurice Tuchman) to Coe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Foulkes, Llyn, Hill #3 (Selected by Wal- ter Hopps) to Quincy Art Club, Quincy, Illi- nois.

The exhibition has been rescheduled for the spring of 1970, Feb. 22 to May 16. The exhibition Selections From the Drawing Collection of David Daniels at the Fogg Art Museum, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, from Oct. 15 to Nov. 25, comprised eighty- six selected drawings ranging in time from the late 16th century to the present decade and representing such outstanding artists as Bellows, Daumier, Ingres, Manet, Modig- liani, Munch, Picasso, Tiepolo, Van Gogh and Watteau. Two groups of drawings are particularly outstanding: the six drawings by Boucher and the thirteen by Degas. The exhibition continues the Fogg's tradi- tion of showing private collections of draw- ings, for which it prepares a fully illus- trated catalogue. The exhibition has been shown previously this year at the Minneap- olis Institute of Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum. The UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES Art Galleries, under the direc- tion of Frederick S. Wight, have been se- lected by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum to organize and premiere a major Jean Arp Memorial Exhibition, opening in the UCLA Galleries Nov. 11 through Dec. 15, with participation by the Des Moines Art Center and the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition will be shown at the Guggenheim May 2 to June 29. The exhi- bition will present a comprehensive retro- spective of the artist's entire lifework, from 1903 until his death in 1966. A Medieval Treasury, held from Oct. 9 to Nov. 3 at the Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art at CORNELL UNIVER- SITY, is the first major exhibition of medi- eval art to be presented in central New York. From thirty museums, galleries and private collections were drawn more than 100 objects which comprise the exhibition, which traveled to the Munson-Williams- Proctor Institute in Utica in November. In- cluded were wood carvings, illuminated manuscripts, metalwork and enamel, as well as larger pieces of sculpture in wood and stone, stained glass and textiles. Accompa- nying the exhibition is the most ambitious catalogue that the Museum has yet at- tempted. In its 200 pages are reproductions in color and black and white of most of the objects, and each piece has been described and interpreted by Professor Robert G. Calkins, director of the exhibition. Through the efforts of Dr. Harold E. Dick- son, Professor Emeritus of Art History of the Pennsylvania State University, a special James Lechay. Portrait of Howard and Gretchen Rogovin. In his exhibition at Kraushaar Galleries, New York. Lechay is on the faculty of the State University of Iowa. exhibition has been arranged to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Ackland Art Center at the UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA. Originally a semi- nar idea when Dr. Dickson was a visiting professor at North Carolina, the theme Arts of the Young Republic: The Age of William Dunlap has become an exhibition for which works have been loaned from public and private collections throughout the country with a special anniversary vol- ume which contains 194 illustrations of the period, nearly half full page plates, pre- pared by Dr. Dickson with an introduction by Joseph C. Sloane, Director of the Art Center. (See page 180) Forms Upon the Frontier was presented at the UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY Art Gallery and Tanner Room, along with the American Folk Arts and Folk Life Confer- ence during the summer. Materials were as- sembled to suggest a wide scope in geo- graphic origin, in chronological develop- ment, and a few distinctive ethnic groups. Reliance to a large extent upon photo- graphs was mandatory because of prohibi- tive costs in shipping artifacts. Many insti- tutions and individuals contributed photo- graphs, artifacts and advice, put together by Austin E. Fife and H. Reuben Rey- nolds, both of Utah State University. The Gun Show, prepared by the DOUGLASS COLLEGE art department, was held in the gallery of the Arts Building from Nov. 24 to Dec. 19. The exhibit explores with great diversity the role of the gun in contempo- rary society. Included are works by Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Brett White- ley, Juan Genoves, Philip McCracken, Edward Ruscha, and Henri Victor Le Fau- connier, as well as faculty members and former students of the Douglass art depart- ment. Most of the works are conventional in media, but the exhibition included sound devices, lights and fresh flowers. From Jan. 22 to Mar. 31 the Fogg Art Museum at HARVARD UNIVERSITY will exhibit Grenville L. Winthrop: Retrospec- tive for a Collector, commemorating the Winthrop bequest to the Fogg in 1943. To- talling over 3,700 objects, this is the largest single gift ever made to a university museum in the United States. It ranges from Chinese jades, bronzes, and Buddhist sculpture through Mediterranean and American antiquities to European paint- ings, drawings, prints, sculpture and deco- rative arts of the 14th to 20th centuries. For the present occasion, a display of 150 selected pieces will try to convey the range and quality that characterized Winthrop's taste. Grenville Winthrop was a direct de- cendent of the first governor of Massachu- setts. After graduating from Harvard Col- lege and Harvard Law School, he returned to New York to live. As a collector, he never sought attention or publicity during his lifetime, and he rarely loaned objects, so that they were accessible only to students, scholars and acquaintances. As a whole, the collection's strengths lie in two main areas: ancient China and 18th and 19th century Britain and France. In the Chinese area the pieces displayed range from Neolithic ritual objects to Buddhist stone and gilt bronze sculpture. With a predilection for portraiture, Winthrop chose paintings and drawings from England and France, be- tween about 1760 and 1900, which sum up the interrelations between the two countries from Blake to Beardsley and from David to Toulouse-Lautrec. American Paintings of the 19th Century, a col- lection of 17 noted paintings presenting a range of work of the Hudson River School, from about 1835 to 1885, was on display in the Beaumont-May Gallery at the Hopkins Center, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE, until Nov. 3. Most of the paintings, from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Laurance Rocke- feller, were assembled by Mrs. Rockefel- ler's grandfather, Frederick Billings, of Woodstock. Twelve artists are represented, including Albert Bierstadt, whose The Grand Tetons and San Francisco Bay are shown, and William Bradford, Accompany- ing the exhibition is a catalogue which in- cludes an introduction by Professor John Wilmerding, Chairman of the Department of Art, and a foreward by Truman H. Brackett, Jr., Director of Galleries. ART JOURNAL XXVIII 2 212</page><page sequence="13">Medieval art was exhibited at the Kresge Art Center Gallery at MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY in October. It was the first showing for the 15th century life-size wood carving of San Isidoro (Fig. 3) given to the university art collection by the Ransom Fidelity Company and found by Dr. Paul Love, Gallery Director, in Spain. Included were illuminated manuscripts, loaned by the Victoria and Albert Museum through the American Federation of Arts, and sev- eral small carved works of the 14th and 15th centuries loaned by the Detroit In- stitute of Arts. An exhibition of The Machine will be pre- sented at the UNIVERSITY OF ST. THOMAS from March 25 to May 18. It is commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, where it will open in late November, with the University of St. Thomas and the San Francisco Museum of Art, where it will be seen in the summer, co-sponsoring. Mr. Pontus Hulten, Director of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm, has been asked to be the show's Guest Director. Mr. Hulten has assembled oil paintings, collages, drawings, and large metal sculptures showing the im- pact on artists of mechanization and mobil- ity. Included will be works of Dada, futur- ists, surrealists, and contemporary artists, as well as automatons, a Bugatti Royale, and a turbine racing car, and photographs of 19th century machines. The works have been amassed from sources throughout Eu- rope and from rarely shown private collec- tions, such as those of Peggy Guggenheim and Nelson Rockefeller. Six two-story buildings have been designed by Dominique de Menil and built to house A Young Teaching Collection of the UNI- VERSITY OF ST. THOMAS, which went on public exhibition at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts for the first time No- vember 6. Visitors find a different world of art in each room. Egyptian art of the Mid- dle Kingdom and New Kingdom is on the lower floor of one building with art of the Ancient Near East in the room above. One room is a chapel. The tallest building, 28 feet high, with a great double staircase, evokes a Mayan sacrificial pyramid and houses the Pre-Columbian works, the most notable of which is a stone stele from the Peten region of Guatemala. The collection was started unexpectedly through the gift of four panels by the 14th century Italian painter, Jacopo del Casentino, in 1960 by an anonymous donor. No other gift followed until 1962, when Jermayne MacAgy, founder and chairman of the Art Depart- ment, mentioned to John and Dominique de Menil that a collection at Saint Thomas was vital and that the Museum, however rich, could not replace a collection that would be available to students for study purposes. In that year ten fairly modest pieces were acquired, including a small Cy- cladic idol and a Dogon figure. After the death of Dr. MacAgy, her intention was carried on, and in 1964 there were three major acquisitions: an Egyptian relief of the 20th Dynasty, a Hellenistic marble torso, and a 15th century Virgin and child from Lorraine. From these beginnings, the collection has expanded into many other media and periods, until a most recent purchase of thirty-eight pieces from New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. A full catalogue will accompany the show in Culli- nan Hall. Simultaneously, at Jones Hall of the UNI- VERSITY OF ST. THOMAS, the personal collection of Dr. MacAgy will be shown in a commemorative exhibition called Jermayne MacAgy: A Life Illustrated by an Exhibi- tion. The objects in this show, although be- queathed to the university at the death of Dr. MacAgy and part of the Permanent Collection, will be listed separately in their own catalogue. (See page 179) The Houston Film Conference, directed by Media Center, the UNIVERSITY OF ST. THOMAS, National Film Study Project, was held October 18-20. It included screen- ings, panels, discussions and lectures as well as demonstrations on films, teaching film making, experimenting and teaching with film, trends in documentary photography, modes of educational television and much more. The WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COLLEGE National Painting Show held Oct. 25 to Nov. 16, in conjunction with the Washington and Jefferson Arts Festival 1968 showed 45 paintings selected from nearly 300 entries by Dr. Paul Chew, Director of the Westmoreland County Art Museum, and Paul Edwards, Chairman of the Wash- ington and Jefferson Art Department. Professor Joseph A. Baird, Jr., has announced that students in museum training and con- noisseurship in the Art Department, the UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS, are organizing an exhibition on French art in the 1860's, to be held in May and early June of 1969, as part of the cen- tennial celebrations of the University: 1869 to 1969. Focus will be on the group of younger artists around Manet, who later became known as Impressionists. There will be thoughtful studies of such subjects as: teachers and pupils, the Salons, journals and critics, humor, and cafe life, including emphasis on the role of the Caf6 Guerbois. The exhibition will be held in various gal- leries on campus and will cover a wide range of media, from documentary photo- graphs to fine drawings and paintings. There will be a published catalogue with essays on the general cultural scene by fac- ulty in various divisions of the humanities. The greater portion of the catalogue will be compiled by students in museum train- ing and will expand the various implica- tions of the art of the era with carefully re- searched bibliographies, historical research and as wide a selection of pictorial sources as possible. Professor Baird has said that those taking part in the project would ap- preciate suggestions or assistance from our readers. The Visual Art Program of ULSTER COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE opened its 1968-1969 Art Series at the Stone Ridge campus with the exhibition Folding Screen Paintings in Traditional Subject and Techniques by Living Japa- nese Masters. The fourteen screens were painted especially for this exhibition and represent traditional Japanese style and material. The show was conceived and or- ganized by Ruth Muroff, Coordinator of Visual Arts at the College with the gener- ous assistance of Richard Chalfant of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Akio Saito of Kyoto, who aided in obtaining the screens from the artists in Japan. Professor Minor White of the MASSACHU- SETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY prepared the fall exhibition Light7 to in- augurate a biennial program of large pho- tographic exhibitions at the Hayden Gal- lery. Light7 represents a cross section of American and European photographers who are working in the vein that Alfred Steiglitz indicated in the statement, "Pho- tography brings what is not visible to the surface.O' The exhibition is a contempo- rary manifestation of the overlapping of psychology, science, art and religion. The exhibition makes no attempt to be a didac- tic explanation of "Light,7" either to the Seventh Power or to 7 Levels of Light, al- though both of these structurings are in- herent in the show. The raw materials for the show are some 3,500 photographs pro- vided by over 200 photographers.

This gift was the impetus for the es- tablishment of the Museum, which as officially opened three years later.

Other paintings also point to traditions from which abstract art in this country evolved.

(See right hand column) 10 Downtown, catalogue for an exhibition held Oct. 18-Nov. 17 at the Picker Gallery, the Charles A. Dana Creative Arts Center, COLGATE UNIVERSITY, 20 pages, intro- duction by Edward Bryant, biographical sketches and 10 illustrations. (NOTE: All catalogues that have been re- ceived have been reviewed. Catalogues re- ceived after deadline will be reviewed in the next issue. Catalogues announced but not yet published have not been listed.) notes on art museums Boston: The MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS re- cently lent Claude Monet's La Japonaise to Tokyo's National Museum of Modern Art. We wonder what the Japanese thought of La Japonaise in Japanese kimono and pose. No odder, when you think of it, than Yas Kuni- yoshi's Self-portrait in plus-fours on the Ogunquit golf course. The Museum's For- sythe Wickes Collection of Eighteenth Cen- tury French Art, one of the finest in this country, bequeathed to Boston in 1965, opened last fall. Recently shown was the exhi- bition "The Gold of Ancient America: Mas- terpieces from the Pre-Columbian World" which is currently at the Art Institute of Chi- cago and later will be shown at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. It was organised by Allen Wardwell, Curator of Primitive Art at the Art Institute, who wrote the comprehen- sive, scholarly catalogue. Patricia Alward has been appointed Editor of museum publica- tions and will be responsible for the series of scholarly and general publications to coincide with the museum's Centennial in 1970. New York: THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, like Boston, is also celebrating its Centennial in 1970 and has announced a major exhibition for the event: "New York, New York:1940-1970". This is the first time that the museum has recognized the modern art movement with a major exhibition pro- gram. We wonder if it ever could have hap- pened under the leadership of Francis Taylor or James Rorimer. It is projected as 160 works from 35 painters and seven sculptors and will be on view from Oct. 1 to Jan. 3. It is made possible through the generosity of the Xerox Corporation. Although it will close before we go to press, we report the exhibition of "Medieval Trea- sures from Private Collections in U.S. and Canada" held at The Cloisters (until mid- Jan.). The selections were made by Carmen Gomez-Moreno, Associate Curator of Medi- eval Art, who also prepared the catalogue which includes 245 illustrations ($7.95). The Metropolitan is redoing its Fifth Ave- nue facade. Designed by Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo and Associates, it incorporates the 1000 foot front, with removal of the wooden vestibule known to habitues (and hippies) as the "doghouse" to be replaced by a broad, easily ascended staircase, relocation of the auto-pedestrian entrances, and the inclusion of two great fountains flanking the new main stairway. The design will respect the central portion by Richard Morris Hunt, dating about 1894. The Egyptian Temple of Dendur which was assigned (not without criticism from other cities) to the Metropolitan last April by President Johnson is to be erected in a specially designed enclosure at the north end of the building. Changes in the Metropolitan's Constitution and By-Laws have led to the election of Rob- ert Lehman as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees. AFRICAN AND AFRO-AMERICAN ART: THE TRANSATLANTIC TRADITION, the first exhibition to establish direct links be- tween the traditional arts of West African civilizations and Negro art in the New World, was held at THE MUSEUM OF PRIMITIVE ART, New York, last fall. The aim was to demonstrate the carry-over to the Western Hemisphere, via slavery, of the arts of the Akan of Ghana, the Fon of Dahomey, the tribes of the Congo-Angola area, and the Yo- ruba and Cross River tribes of Nigeria. Styles and themes reappear in Negro art from Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, Surinam, and, in the United States, from Georgia, Missouri and Harlem. This exhibition has documented Af- rican and Afro-American art as a major cur- rent in the history of world art. Robert F. Thompson, Assistant Professor of Art History at YALE UNIVERSITY, who or- ganized the exhibition, says: "By re-establish- ing ties between the visual arts of West Af- rica with the arts of the blacks of North America, the Caribbean, and South America, one adds to the history of misery, which de- fines so much of Afro-American scholarship, a history of glory. That this is a history most Afro-Americans never knew they had is poig- nantly demonstrated by James Baldwin's statement in Notes of a Native Son: '. . . not that I liked black people, in fact, I despised them, possibly because they had no Rem- brandt.' The truth is that no group of peo- ple on earth has showed more visual creativ- ity than the West African and his Afro- American brother." Georgia, where Africans were illegally imported as late as 1853, is one of the richest sources of African-influenced art. The names of nine black sculptors are known from the Savannah area. As recently as 1938, William Rogers of Darien, Georgia, produced master- ful figures strongly reminiscent of West Af- rica. One of the most important works in the show is a superb cane carved in 1863 by Henry Gudgell, a blacksmith in Missouri. The late importation (1800-1850) of slaves to Cuba and Brazil, where slavery was not abolished until the 1880s, provided a founda- tion upon which subsequent generations have built a clearly African-based aesthetic. A cos- tume from Cuba dating from the second half of the nineteenth century is here compared with its antecedent from Eastern Nigeria. Currently, American Negroes seeking the historical roots of their identity, have revived elements of West Nigerian (Yoruba) culture -language, costumes, and art. Sculptures by two leading exponents of the neo-Yoruba movement in Harlem, Babalosha Oseiyeman Adefunmi, the American founder and chief priest of the Yoruba Temple, and Akinyele Awolowo, were shown in the exhibition along with the Nigerian antecedents for their work. THE SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM is showing a "Jean Arp Memorial Exhibition" which was organised and first shown (last fall) by the UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES ART GALLERIES under the direction of Freder- ick Wight. Instead of the usual style of cata- logue the exhibition is paralleled by the publication of a handsomely illustrated (large paperback) book on Arp by the late Herbert Read (Harry N. Abrams, Inc. New York, 1968). In addition to the New York showing the exhibition will be seen at the ART JOURNAL XXVll) 2 222</page><page sequence="19">Des Moines Art Center, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, and the Kunsthaus, Zurich. The lecture series at the Guggenheim this winter is "On the Future of Art" with reports on their observations of the crystal ball. The roster of speakers: Louis Kahn, James Sea- wright, J. W. Burnham, Annette Michelson, B. F. Skinner, Arnold J. Toynbee, Michael Fried, Herbert Marcuse. The MUSEUM OF MODERN ART has acquired a large photographic collection (several thousand original prints and many negatives) of the work of Eugene Atget, pur- chased from Berenice Abbott and Julien Levy with the assistance of a gift from Shirley C. Burden. The exhibition "French Bronzes, 1500- 1800" held last November at KNOEDLER AND COMPANY, including about one hun- dred bronzes with loans from museums and private collectors from United States and Eur- ope was accompanied by an important cata- logue; introduction by E. J. B. Watson, Direc- tor of the Wallace Collection and notes on each bronze by Jacques Fischer formerly at the Musee des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg ($3.75, by mail). Washington: The NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART is showing slected paintings from A Salute to Russell Hitchcock Henry-Russell Hitchcock, professor of art, at SMITH COLLEGE since 1948, retired June 1968. He also served as director of the college's Museum of Art from 1949-55. In 1961 he was named Sophia Smith Professor. Mr. Hitchcock is an honorary corresponding member of the Royal Institute of British Ar- chitects and a Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. The Smith College Museum of Art hon- ored its former director last April with an ex- hibition of works of art acquired while he was director. In the catalogue of the exhibition, Robert Rosenblum, professor of fine arts at New York University, wrote "the works ac- quired under his six-year directorship now seem to comprise a refreshingly up-to-date miniature history of modern art." Noted not only as a teacher but as an au- thority on Victorian and modern architec- ture, he received in 1961 an award of $10,000 from the American Council of Learned Socie- ties for distinguished accomplishment in hu- manistic scholarship. Included among his many books are monographs on Frank Lloyd Wright, H. H. Richardson and J. J. P. Oud, a two-volume work "Early Victorian Architec- ture in Britain," and some years ago, with Philip Johnson, the wellknown Museum of Modern Art publication, "The International Style." A third edition of Architecture: Nine- the British art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon in a series of small exhibitions which began last November with sixteen paintings by Turner. Constable will be shown in May. The paintings in the collection num- ber more than a thousand with important groups by Gainsborough, Stubbs, Devis, Wright of Derby, Rowlandson, Bonington, Blake and Palmer. THE CORCORAN GALLERY OF ART has taken over the Washington Gallery of Modern Art in a friendly incorporation which includes naming Walter Hopps of the Modern Gallery as Director of Special Pro- grams at the Corcoran. The 21st St. building will be retained for the time being and will be used as a "Workshop Project" for local art- ists. Two new staff members, in addition to Mr. Hopps have been added to the Gallery. Moussa M. Domit is Assistant Director com- ing from Yale University's Art Gallery where he was curator of Intra-University Loan Col- lections, and James F. Pilgrim, Curator of American Art who until recently has been at the Metropolitan Museum of New York. Williamstown: THE STERLING AND FRANCINE CLARK ART INSTITUTE which opened in 1955 in a neo-classical struc- ture of 44,000 square feet has announced plans for a major addition of 82,000 square Henry-Russell Hitchcock teenth and Twentieth Centuries, in the Peli- can History of Art series, appeared in 1968. It received an award from the English Au- thors' Society. Two books by Hitchcock have feet to house additional exhibition galleries, staff offices, an auditorium and a library pro- jected at 1,000,000 volumes. The Williams College graduate program leading to the M.A. degree in art history will utilize the re- sources of the new addition. The design of the addition is by Pietro Belluschi in associa- tion with The Architects' Collaborative of Cambridge. Pittsburgh: The Museum of Art of the CAR- NEGIE INSTITUTE which in recent years has been making numerous important addi- tions to its collection, has recently acquired a fine late work by Van Gogh, The Plain of Auvers completed just days before he shot himself on July 27, 1890. Coming from the collection of Marshall Field it was formerly owned by Count Henri Kessler of Berlin. The painting is a gift of the Sarah Mellon Scaife family. The Carnegie Museum recently held a retrospective exhibition of the contempo- rary Danish painter, Carl-Henning Pedersen, whose work was first seen in this country in the 1952 Pittsburgh International exhibition, on the invitation of Gordon Washburn. Ped- ersen has offered to give his own huge collec- tion of his work (he has refused to sell since 1960) to the state of Denmark if a special museum is built to house them. One is re- minded of the special Munch Museum in Oslo which houses a superb collection of Munch paintings and prints. H.R.H. also received the C. R. Morey award of the COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION and also the Alice Davis Hitchcock award for the So- ciety of Architectural Historians. The latter award was established some years earlier by Mr. Hitchcock himself in memory of his mother. As productive as he is articulate this inde- fatigable scholar has recently completed two more books appearing this season: German Rococo: the Zimmerman Brothers, and Ro- coco Architecture in Southern Germany. Also, due are a new edition of his book Rhode Island Architecture and a paperback edition Painting Toward Architecture. Quite a year! The October 1963 Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians was dedicated to Hitchcock, as a former president of the soci- ety and one of its earliest members. In that issue the late Carroll Meeks of Yale Univer- sity referred to Hitchcock as "the father of modern architectural history in the United States." The December 1968 issue of the Journal is a Festschrift of writings by differ- ent authors presented as a tribute to this dis- tinguished critic-scholar. Hitchcock, holds A.B. and A.M. degrees from Harvard University (it is one of the ironies of the profession that neither he nor Alfred Barr received the Ph.D. when graduate students at Harvard.) He taught at Wesleyan University from 1946-49 and has also taught ART JOURNAL XXVlll 2 224</page><page sequence="20">at Vassar College, Connecticut College, Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology, at Yale, Cambridge (England), Harvard and New York Universities. He has lectured frequently in Germany and Holland. During World War II, he spent a year in the Navy Depart- ment's Bureau of Aeronautics and was then for two years a technical author at Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Company. For the first semester of the next two years, Mr. Hitchcock will teach a course on Baroque Architecture and seminar on Louis Sullivan and his Contemporaries at the University of Massachusetts. During the second semester of next year he will teach a course on Art Nou- veau at Smith. Beginning in 1970, he will be on the faculty of the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, and for one semester he will be at the Victorian Studies Center of the University of Leicester. He recently bought a house in New York City where he plans to make his home in 1970. Announcement: Metropolitan Museum Journal, Vol. 1 has re- cently been announced. Not to be confused with the Museum's Bulletin, the new journal will have an Editorial Board consisting of: Brian F. Cook, Associate Curator of Greek and Roman Art; Helmut Nickel, Curator of Arms and Armor; Olga Raggio, a Curator of Western European Arts; and Claus Virch, Curator of European Paintings. This Journal will be a perodical devoted to scholarly arti- cles of a specialized nature written by the Museum's curators and other scholars on ob- jects in the Museum's collections. The Jour- nal will be published annually. 176 pages, 224 photographs and drawings. 81/2 11 inches. Clothbound. $10.00 Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., announces the publication of CORPUS RUBENIANUM LUDWIG BURCHARD: An Illustrated Cata- logue Raisonne of the Work of Peter Paul Rubens is based on material compiled by the late Dr. Burchard, whose vast knowledge and understanding of the life and work of Rubens earned him universal esteem and recognition as the pre-eminent authority. Sponsored by the City of Antwerp and edited by the Bel- gian Center for Sixteenth- and Seventeenth- Century Fine Arts, the work will be published in twenty-six parts, each dealing with a par- ticular commission or group of subjects. (Some parts will consist of more than one volume.) CORPUS RUBENIANUM will be com- pleted over the next ten years by a group of other distinguished Rubens scholars. Since they will contribute their own researches, the critical catalog will be much more than merely a posthumous work of Ludwig Bur- chard. Each volume will bear the name of the compiler, who will explain clearly in his preface and in his text what he owes to the research of Dr. Burchard and what is his own contribution. The publication of CORPUS RUBENIANUM may thus be considered a continuation of Dr. Burchard's unfinished lifework by a younger generation of investiga- tors. Volume I, The Ceiling Paintings for the Jesuit Church in Antwerp, by Professor John Rupert Martin of Princeton University, is al- ready published.</page><page sequence="21">Tax Deductible Gifts The provision in the federal income tax law which allows the taxpayer to deduct from his adjusted gross income contributions to educational institutions, including gifts of works of art appraised at fair market value, has been of enormous value in the enrich- ment of art museums of all kinds and sizes from the great institutions of our big cities to remote and little known art centers or col- lege galleries. But it is no secret that in the inflationary climate of rising prices in the art market, not a few prospective donors have claimed excessive evaluations. Often the In- ternal Revenue Service investigators have had difficulty in determining whether to allow or reject a claim, and frequently bona fide ap- praisals have been questioned along with the more flagrant ones. After many a hassle with conflicting claims as to the proper value of this or that work of art, the Treasury Department recently es- tablished an Art Advisory Panel (which serves without pay) to review cases of deduc- tion claims for gifts of works of art. The members are: Sherman Lee (Cleveland Museum of Art), Charles Cunningham (Art Institute of Chicago), Gordon Smith (Al- bright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo), Richard Brown, (Kimbell Foundation, Fort Worth), A. Hyatt Mayor (formerly Metropolitan Museum, New York), Charles Seymour (Yale University Art Gallery), Edward Lubin (Art Dealer, New York), E. Thaw (Art Dealer, New York), Louis Goldenberg (Art Dealer, N.Y.), Allan McNab (La Pointe, Wis.). Prior to the naming of this panel the Art Dealers' Asso- ciation had been effective in providing sound appraisals, but many donors by-passed the Association, possibly because of the fee charged. Also, rightly or not, some people thought that the dealer, whatever his moral rectitude, might in certain cases find himself with a conflict of interest. It will be noted that the Advisory Panel includes six members from the museum profession and three from the art trade. This panel has already had a steadying in- fluence not only in questioning exaggerated claims but also in backing up certain very high evaluations which appeared to be justi- fied. However there is a vastly larger number of cases than the Panel can handle and the stories of outrageous claims and unscrupu- lous tax dodges continue to go the rounds. Lately they have been causing concern on Capitol Hill. We are informed by impeccably reliable sources that there are congressmen who propose to re-examine the federal tax law and to eliminate the provision allowing gifts to be evaluated at present fair market value regardless of their original cost to the donor. Such a blanket restriction would con- ceivably shut off the abuses, but it would also place such a drastic penalty on bona fide gifts that these would almost certainly be re- ii~tX. xxx,: iii~ii~i 1~~'~i~liiiiii:BI::~::i~imw: Ili~iiliima, X.,iii~~~ii:i:~~ :x: i i:iii l:ii ': lii: liiiiiiii~ iiiiiiiiiiii~ii~;gjjp~ iiii~iX Il::::i;:::~Liii~~l~~: i I:i~ieiail?:......... .::: Zti~iii f~jiiii j. .... .........i l i~iij:~iiiriii.. .... . ................... ...l~i ::::::::::l~ iiii~il....... ...i~ .Y.i ? iil ij:i~iti~l .iiilii i gg?' ii'ili~ii'i~iiiiii; iii~~~t~?i~ ~?i :~l~l~-lii ~l-liil~lil:: l~l :-:-- . :~i -::-iiiiiiiiiii ai~ ?:~i l~-::::i:':::::'::' :-::::'?: ':' : ::' :-iilil::_ : : ii:-li~i , K.iii :t ? ~ ~~:ii~':: ~l-i::ii~i-i~iii-::::: ::::::.-:--:-: :::-...........::-i ~?- ?j:::-:_ -:i-:-i::ii-ii-j -- ~ '-:-:::--'-------::-:--. . . . . . . . . .ii~ii'~jji ~ '~i.Eiiiiliiii~iiiiii:-i Ijiiijijjiiiljj- iiii~i-ii~ _i_~-i_-i- i i..., ..::--:-:_:_ ::;::.::::..........- ?i pr::,,,:,,::::::::::: : :l--l- .-:---::-_--::i ~ l:::::: ,ijjijlli iiiiijii ii ,i_;: :I: -ii - - :-:--- - - ..........--:-:iiiii~iiiiiiiiii~ ; Norman Rockwell, The Critic, oil on canvas, 40 X 371/4". In a retrospective exhibition at Bernard Danenberg Galleries, New York last fall. An example of the talent of the well-known illustrator addressed here toward satire of a young art student (clean-shaven, yet!). Armed with painting equipment, art appreciation textbook, catalogue and loupe, he examines the jewel-laden bosom of a luscious Rubens blonde (Helene Fourment?) who responds with coquettish delight to this microscopic inspection of her charms. The Dutch burghers (Hals?) glare at the intruder. Executed in Rockwell's characteristic manner of meticulous photographic realism (note the picture frames), it is cleverly composed. The bent-forward body allows an unobstructed view of the burghers. The awkward arrange- ment of the arms, like a semaphore, draws our attention almost simultaneously to the two paintings, and the cropping of the group portrait adds a feeling of immediacy. It's a long way from abstract expressionism, but not so very far from Pop. duced to a small fraction and the spirit of the law would be denied, resulting in a very serious loss to the cultural enrichment of public art collections. There appears to be a widespread notion on the part of recipients that the matter of evaluation of a proposed art gift lies entirely with the donor and his sources of expertise. The old saw, "Never look a gift horse in the mouth" has apparently been the guideline in some quarters. And the Treasury Department at least up to now has unintentionally en- couraged this attitude by informing recipi- ents of art gifts that their appraisals were considered to be biassed. It is seldom that a dubious gift is offered to a museum or art center operated by a professional staff and if offered it would very probably be refused. But there are many small centers staffed by people without experience in the art world, and the same can be said of many small col- leges whose educational function makes them eligible for tax deductible gifts. These abuses continue, largely, we believe because the re- cipient having no access to professional opin- ion about the quality of the proffered works of art expresses gratitude for this "generous" gift, and is wholly unaware that he may be contributing to tax evasion. It is the aim of the College Art Association to inform its readers of the facts, to urge them to recognize their responsibility, and to aid others in their institutions (such as artis- tically uninformed administrative officers) and to use their judgement and influence in an effort to reduce the abuses (while at the same time encouraging honest giving at hon- est evaluations). Our basic goal is to preserve the splendid American custom of public giv- ing in cultural fields and to adhere to the spirit of the Federal Tax Law which makes these gifts economically attractive.-H.R.H.
