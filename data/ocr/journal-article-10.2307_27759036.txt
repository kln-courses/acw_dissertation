<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept Kendon Smith* University of North Carolina at Greensboro During the past thirty years, psychologists have become persuaded that the con cept of "drive" is stale, flat, and unprofitable. Their growing disenchantment has shown itself in many ways, but it has been clearly reflected in the Annual Review of Psychology, where a series of reviewers (Appley, 1970; Bolles &amp; Moot, 1972; Campbell &amp;Misanin, 1969; Cofer, 1959; MacCorquodale, 1955; Wayner &amp; Carey, 1973) has expressed deeper and deeper misgivings about the notion. "Drive" is not even indexed in the Reviews for 1972 through 1982, excepting incidental references in 1979 and 1980?and an entry in 1973 which guides the reader to the chapter on basic drives, where he finds that "the term drive ... is not only useless but is actually meaningless and confusing in the literature . . . [T]he term serves no scientific purpose and should be abandoned" (Wayner &amp; Carey, 1973, p. 54). The latter statement echoes Cofer and Appley's earlier dictum: "The drive concept is without utility. As a matter of fact, we think it is worse than this?it is a liability" (1964, p. 837). In the literature at large, one can find several kinds of objection to "drive." Many writers are dismayed, as were Wayner and Carey (1973), at the wide variety of definitions the term has accumulated. There is also some suspicion that "drive" might possess overtones of mentalism or vitalism (e.g., Baumeister, Hawkins &amp; Cromwell, 1964; Beach, 1942, 1970; Bindra, 1959, p. 19; Bolles, 1967, pp. 8, 440ff.; 1975, pp. 100-101; Morgan, 1979; Wayner &amp; Carey, 1973). In the main, however, the objections are more substantive. They seem to be aimed at a four-fold concept of "drive", freely attributed to psychology in general, in which drive is seen as: (1) a product of organic need which gives rise to (2) afferent stimulation and (3) behavioral activation, and which offers the possibility of (4) reinforcement through its own reduction. In correspondence with those four Work on this paper was assisted by a research leave, granted by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and spent largely in the libraries of Macalester College and the University of Min nesota. The manuscript was read and evaluated, at one stage or another, by Mr. George W. Capehart, Dr. Fred Previe, Dr. Richard L. Shull, and Dr. John H. Seta. To all of these institutions and colleagues I am most sincerely grateful.

Many states of physiological need have no impact whatsoever upon behavior. A well-known example is that of oxygen deficiency, which can go to fatality under certain conditions without disturbing the animal at all. Conversely, behavior may be strongly affected by bodily states which do not represent real needs. Thus, the presence of sex hormones in the blood stream has a profound effect upon an animal's behavior, even though the hormones pose no threat to the animal's well-being. 2. A mass of empirical evidence, developed during the past three or four decades, tells strongly against the traditional notion that, when needs do affect behavior, they do so through "local" stimulation. 3. Although states of physiological deficiency often seem to produce general activity, that activity may in fact be due entirely, or at least largely, to learning. When animals respond to a state of need by becoming active, they most likely do so because they have been reinforced for doing so in the past. If animals were rewarded for passivity, they would become passive instead. There is little if any dependable evidence that need in itself is an activator. 4. The postulate that all reinforcement is traceable to the reduction of drive, through the fulfillment of need, has always been a precarious one. There are many instances in which the enhancement of need, activation, or tension appears to be rewarding. One thinks of curiosity, the search for suspense or thrills, and attempts at "self-actualization." Although these four statements are synoptic in the extreme, the literature from which they have been drawn is readily available (e.g., Baumeister et al., 1964; Beach, 1956; Bindra, 1959, 1968; Bolles, 1958, 1967, 1975; Cofer, 1972; Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964; Fowler, 1965; Harlow, 1953a, 1953b, 1953c; Maslow, 1955, 1971; as well as papers cited above from Annual Review of Psychology). Now, even as the notion of "drive" has been suffering criticism and abandon ment, the idea of "incentive motivation" has been gaining a complementary acceptance (see Appley's review, 1970, pp. 492-496; also Bindra, 1974, 1976; Bolles, 1972, 1975; Cofer, 1972; Estes, 1969a, 1969b; Lajoie &amp; Bindra, 1976; Logan, 1968, 1977, 1979). The term "incentive" lived for years in happy sym biosis with the term "drive," of course?an incentive being simply the object of a drive (cf. Dashiel, 1937, fn. p. 102; Warden, 1931, p. 14; Warden &amp; Nissen, 1928; Young, 1961, pp. 205-206). Indeed, even present-day practice does not preclude a reciprocity between the two notions (Hall, 1976, p. 231). All the same, it has now become commonplace to draw a sharp distinction between "drive," on the one hand, and "incentive motivation," on the other. "Incentive motivation" is given few moorings in deprivation or need, and behavioral arousal under incentive motivation is seen as being generated by stimuli from the incentive itself rather than exclusively by events occurring within the organism. Incentive motivation theory, like drive theory, does embody a principle of reinforcement; but the prin ciple is at least nominally the one associated with classical conditioning rather than the one derived from instrumental learning. 72</page><page sequence="3">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept At the moment, then, the concept of "drive" stands accused of a number of serious inadequacies, and the concept of "incentive motivation" is being wel comed as a promising replacement. The present essay submits that there is in justice in this situation. It argues that the notion of "drive" has been considerably distorted by those who disparage it, and that the notion is in fact a valid and useful one. In pursuing its argument, the paper first sets forth a rather detailed history of the usage of the term "drive," beginning with r.S. Woodworth (1918) and going as far as c. l. Hull (1943, 1951, 1952). It then abstracts from that history what appears to have been the classical concept of "drive." It turns next to an examination of the notion of "drive" as proposed by Hull in particular; it proceeds to argue that Hull's conception differed materially from the classical one; and it points out that the recent criticisms of "drive" apply to Hull's idea alone, leaving the traditional notion unscathed. A brief summary of the history of "drive" since Hull's time then demonstrates that it is the traditional concept, rather than Hull's, which has survived as the actual consensus. Some of the im plications of the consensual view are explored. Finally, it is suggested that the phenomena of "incentive motivation" can be dealt with quite adequately in terms of the concept of "drive" and thus that it is doubtful that the former concept is of any real utility. The Concept of "Drive" ? 1918 to 1943 Woodwork's Formulation ? 1918 As all psychologists know, the word "drive" was formally positioned within the technical language of psychology by r. S. Woodworth.1 He developed the construct he had in mind in a series of lectures delivered in 1916-1917 and publish ed, as Dynamic Psychology, in 1918. Wood worth began with analogies from the inanimate: a machine driven by an external source of power; a loaded gun?in which "the action of drive is to liberate . . . stored energy" (p. 38). He turned to the instance of living muscle fibers releasing energy under neural stimulation?"the nerve drives the muscle" (p. 38). Then to the total sensory-motor reflex unit?"its drive is . . . the external stimulus" (p. 38); he pointed out, however, that the function of such a reflex unit can be facilitated by neural impulses from "other centers in the brain and spinal cord" (p. 39); and "if one nerve center can thus furnish drive for another, there is some sense in speaking of drives" (p. 39). From this relatively concrete, neurological level of discourse, Wood worth then made an unabashed leap. Adopting Sherrington's distinction between "precur rent" (preparatory) and "consummatory" reactions (Sherrington, 1906, pp. 329ff.), Woodworth went on to suggest that "the mechanism for a consummatory reaction, having been set into activity by a suitable stimulus, acts as a drive !It has been noted by Remley (1980) that J. B. Watson and J. J. B. Morgan used the term "drive" in a paper published in 1917. Their usage was, however, quite informal. 73</page><page sequence="4">Kendon Smith operating other mechanisms which give the preparatory reactions" (p. 41). To illustrate his meaning, Woodworth offered the example of a hunting dog in ac tion, the dog's preparatory responses of ranging and stalking being pictured as somehow driven by input from the consummatory response of pr?dation. Woodworth proceded then to elaborate upon his hypothetical principle at an even more speculative level. He suggested that "sometimes the instincts furnish drive for other mechanisms" (p. 67) and that "native drives may also become combined into mixed or compound motives," such as "love" and "respect" (p. 100). Finally, Woodworth pointed to what he regarded as the most important case of all, that in which drive seems actually to be inherent in the behavior driven: "The drive behind the industry of the genius is not the drive of hunger, or sex, or rivalry . . . [It] is to be sought within the activity itself" (pp. 132-133; see also pp. 69-70). It seems clear today that Woodworth's neurology was largely cosmetic, and that what he was in fact discussing would ordinarily be called "motives," "desires," "wants," or "purposes"; nevertheless, "drive" had been given an impressive introduction, and there seems to have arisen the general presumption that the term represented a real phenomenon?one which was easy enough to recognize in specific instances but rather difficult, perhaps, to put into words. Such difficulties notwithstanding, the years between 1918 and 1943 did in fact bring innumerable attempts to verbalize the notion of "drive." There follows now an account of the chief ones, that account being followed in turn by an attempt to define the concept of "drive" which had, by the end of the period in question, established itself quite firmly. Early Definitions of "Drive" ? 1918-1943 The first psychologist to take up Woodworth's new term seems to have been F. A. Moss, who published his "Study of Animal Drives" in 1924. In its introduc tion he said this: By "drive" I mean the impelling forces in the situation that stimulate the animal toward certain positive behavior. For example, if an animal is kept without food for a certain length of time, certain organic stimulations of the nerve-endings in the stomach provoke in the animal restless and seek ing behavior until food is found and the "drive" for the time being, stopped. It is to the motive-force behind this seeking behavior that I apply the term "drive." (p. 165) In other places Moss referred to "impelling forces ... in behavior" (p. 181) and the "impelling force, or instinctive drive behind all animal behavior" (p. 182). Young, however, has quoted a personal communication from Woodworth, who in turn cites a statement by Moss that "He [Moss] used the term, not to describe any instinct or necessarily inborn condition in the animal, but to describe a certain set of chemical conditions that make the animal move in a definite direction" (Young, 1936, p. 71). In 1925, Dashiell merely mentioned "drive," describing it as one of several "current additions to psychological vocabulary" (p. 205). In the same year, 74</page><page sequence="5">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept however, Carr published his classical Psychology, which gave close attention to "motives" and "drives." Thus by definition, A motive is a relatively persistent stimulus that dominates the behavior of an individual until he reacts in such a manner that he is no longer affected by it . . . The fundamental motives are often called "organic needs" . . . [and] . . . sometimes referred to as "drives." (p. 73) Like Moss, then, Carr saw a close connection between drives and needs. On the other hand, he was quite emphatic in denying any general activational function to drive states. Organisms are active in any case; motives simply govern the "direc tion" of behavior: Motives are not essential to activity; rather they must be regarded as the directive forces that determine what we do, for necessarily we must react in a manner that is adapted to satisfy these conditions if we are to continue to exist. (Carr, 1925, pp. 73-74) Carr was not very explicit about how drives exercise their directive effects. It appears from context, nevertheless, that he was thinking principally of the selec tive influence of learning and only distantly, if at all, about any innate powers for the guidance of behavior. The activational function of drives having been disavowed by Carr, their rela tionship to biological need, so far unquestioned, was now coolly disregarded by Tolman (1925-1926). Exploring "The Nature of the Fundamental Drives," Tolman decided that such drives seemed to fall into two main categories: (1) Drives of the First Order. . . [are] sub-divided into . . . appetites and aversions . . . The list of appetites . . . would probably include in addition to hunger and sex: fatigue-demand ... ; sensitive zone demands, for example, finger sucking in children; and excretion demands. The list of aversions seems to be complete with fear and pugnacity, (p. 350) (2) Drives of the Second Order . . . [are] curiosity, gregariousness, self assertion, self-abasement, and imitativeness. Such a list is, of course, quite tentative, (p. 355) Drives of the first order were though to "each correspond to a specific and funda mental physiological need" (p. 354). Second-order drives were less directly related to physiological need, but Tolman was willing to regard the degree of relationship as an empirical problem. Although Tolman's use here of the word "need" would seem to contradict what was said above in introducing his views, it is plain that Tolman's "need" is not to be equated with "need" in the more usual, depriva tional sense of the word. It is difficult to imagine that any biological necessity could underlie sensitive-zone demands, or fear, or pugnacity?to say nothing of the "drives of the second order." As we shall see, a later statement by Tolman (1932) essentially confirms such an interpretation. Following Tolman's essay of 1925-26, there appeared two papers which, important though they may have been, indicated little in the way of conceptual commitment. In 1927 Richter published "Animal Behavior and Internal Drives," 75</page><page sequence="6">Kendon Smith and in 1928 Warden and Nissen made a preliminary statement about "An Ex perimental Analysis of the Obstruction Method of Measuring Animal Drive." What those papers seem chiefly to suggest, from the standpoint of our present in terest, is that "drive" had already become an accepted technical term. As the period now under consideration came to a close, however, there did appear a final, major statement. It was set forth in another classical text, DashielPs Fundamentals of Objective Psychology (1928). Even more than Carr had been, Dashiell was concerned with motivational processes. Unlike Carr, however, Dashiell stressed an activational function for drives. Thus, to Dashiell drives were the original sources of energy that activate the human organism, that set it going, (p. 230) Again: The primary drives to persistent forms of animal and human conduct are tissue-conditions within the organism giving rise to stimulations exciting the organism to overt activity, (pp. 233-234) The primary drives as listed by Dashiell (1928, p. 234ff.) were hunger, sex, bodily temperature, thirst, bladder and colon urges, fatigue, activity, respiratory and cir culatory drives, pain, skin conditions ("sensitive" and "erotic" zones), and a speculative drive (related to the musculature of the sensory organs) that had to do with attention and curiosity. It is apparent that Dashiell was straining to identify "tissue-conditions"?and it is interesting that he chose to employ that term, rather than "need," in the first place. As to any innate directional affects of drive, Dashiell was very skeptical; the directive influences that drives exert were, he believed, wholly or largely learned. In this respect, Dashiell was in essential agree ment with Carr. On the question of activation, he clearly was not. There was a brief hiatus following the publication of DashielPs text. Then, as the new decade began, there appeared another major volume, Warden's Animal Motivation: Experimental Studies on the Albino Rat (1931). Animal Motivation was primarily a record of empirical studies, and Warden remarked at its outset that "as experimentalists, we are not especially interested in theoretical controver sies on questions of terminology0 (p. 14). All the same, he made an effort to say clearly what he meant by "drive": By a drive we mean an aroused reaction tendency which is characterized primarily by the fact that the activity of the organism is directed toward or away from some specific incentive, such as food, water, animal of the opposite sex, etc. If the appropriate incentive object is not present, what appears to be seeking behavior to an outside observer is exhibited. . . . The term drive does not refer to the physiological state or system aroused . . . but to the behavior tendency resulting from the inter nal arousal, (pp. 14-15) Warden nevertheless emphasized that it would seem wise to restrict the use of this term "drives" to activities depending upon the arousal of internal physiological states which can be definitely related to specific incentives, such as food, sex objects, etc. (p. 5) 76</page><page sequence="7">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept It is evident that Warden, in his own use of "drive," meant to hew close to the line of "tissue states," if not of downright "need." It is less evident, but still probably true, that he also thought of activation as a characteristic of the drive state. The most striking feature of Warden's approach, however, lies in the fact that it was essentially behavioral. Drives were no longer regarded as forces, stimuli, or tissue states per se: They were behavior tendencies; they were directed activities; they consisted of "seeking." It is true that Tolman, in his earlier paper (1925-1926), had spoken of "tendencies toward ends"; and Tolman later gave great prominence to "urges," "hungers," and "demands," also (Tolman, 1932). In the Tolmanian orchestration, however, such terms tended to become notes in a mentalistic melody. Coming from Warden, whose orientation was quite behavioristic, an emphasis on response tendencies was considerably more impressive. If Holt's Animal Drive and the Learning Process (1931) can be set aside as not really relevant to the present discussion (as I believe it can, in spite of its title), it was in fact Tolman's book of 1932 that next had much to say about drives; and what it had to say amounted in many ways to an elaboration of Tolman's paper of 1925-26. Again the list of first-order drives appeared, supplemented now by a new item, "Sensory-motor-hungers (i.e., Esthetic and Play Hunters)" (p. 276ff.). The second-order drives were listed as before (p. 291). Each category seems to have become more clearly defined in Tolman's thinking. Thus: Behavior goes off . . . by virtue only of certain final physiological quiescences, which are being sought, or of certain final physiological disturbances which are being avoided. Further, . . . organisms are provid ed innately, at least vaguely, with sign-gestalt-readinesses as to how to get thus to and from, and also with the necessary accompanying demands to make them actually try thus to get to and from. (p. 271) Such innate sign-gestalt-readinesses, with the accompanying appropriate demands, we shall designate ... as the ultimate or fundamental [or first order] drives, (p. 271; cf. p. 290) On the other hand: The second-order drives may be roughly characterized as demands to get to or from certain relatively general environmental situations, plus certain more or less specific sign-gestalt-readiness as to how to get thus to and from. (p. 291) The second-order drives were "ancillary to the first-order ones" (p. 290) but quite possibly just as innate and physiological (pp. 293, 443). Although Tolman now referred repeatedly to physiological quiescences and disturbances, he no longer spoke at all of needs. In view of his list of human drives, as already cited, and his ascription to lower animals of such drives as nest-building, grasshopper catching, and caterpillar-stinging (p. 290), it is evident that the question of physiological need simply did not concern him. In 1932 one might possibly still read Tolman as emphasizing the behavioral aspect of "drive," although it was even more difficult to do so then than it had 77</page><page sequence="8">Kendon Smith been in 1925-1926. If Tolman was equivocal, however, and if even Warden had seemed somewhat tentative, Skinner was neither. In an early paper (1932), Skin ner was already dismantling * 'drive'' and finding nothing but behavior: That there are physiological conditions correlated with all aspects of behavior no one will be likely to question. But it is equally true that behavior may be adequately described without constant reference to its physiological correlates. In the present case the concept of drive arose in the description of behavior and is commonly used there when no knowledge of physiological conditions is available or thought necessary. The term attempts to deal with a special aspect of behavior, (p. 34) In Skinner's judgment, the experimental treatment of drive will take the form . . . [of] the examination of some measured aspect of [reflex] strength as a function of some such variable as time. (p. 34) Thus, in the particular case of hunger in the rat: When we use the term hunger we are describing the presence or absence, the display or want of display, of certain characteristic behavior . . . The mere observation of whether or not a rat eats is not, however, an adequate experimental measure, since it neglects the matter of degree of hunger. An adequate measure of those characteristics of behavior upon which we base a judgment of degree is available in the rate at which a rat eats. (p. 35) Skinner's paper defines with clarity a position he was to insist upon through decades to come. In essence it was this: "You can use the word "drive" if you want to, but you must realize that it merely describes behavioral phenomena which are better described in other ways?and besides, the word is treacherous and misleading." To that sort of injunction Elliot (1935) gave a reply which probably represented the contemporary consensus: It may be objected that the concept of drive is superfluous, that the terminology of deprivation and behavior, or of stimulus and response, is ample for the treatment of motivational problems. A great deal can be said for such an objection but the fact remains that the term drive is firmly entrenched in the current literature, (p. 206) Drive is ... a fruitful concept which can and must be given objective definition, (p. 205) Elliot's own tentative definition was reminiscent of Carr and premonitory of Hull: "the total of internal changes produced in an organism by some kind of depriva tion. 99 (p. 205) In any case, the pursuit of the notion of "drive" did in fact continue. Wood worth spoke out again, this time in the third edition of his introductory textbook (1934). (Curiously, "drive" had not been mentioned at all in the two earlier edi tions, those of 1921 and 1929; nor was it discussed in Woodworth's comprehen sive Experimental Psychology of 1938.) Woodworth's position had now changed somewhat. He too had moved toward a behavioral formulation: Drive is not used to mean simply the chemical condition of hunger, for 78</page><page sequence="9">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept instance; it means the food-seeking character of activity while in this chemical condition, or the food-approaching character of activity when locating food. Concretely, a drive or reaction tendency is an activity in progress, (p. 302) P. T. Young's landmark volume, Motivation of Behavior, appeared in 1936. Although Young's collation of the empirical data then available was careful and complete, his treatment of the conceptual issue merely concluded rather broadly that: To the physical psychologist, drive is the energy which moves the body. To the student of behavior, drive is behavior, whether considered as pur posive or wholly lacking in goal orientation. To the physiological psychologist, drive consists of bodily and environmental conditions?or parts of them?which release energy and regulate the course of behavior. To the student of human personality, drive is an assumed motivating fac tor?a wish, purpose, set, interest, ideal?which controls the course of behavior, (p. 79) Young's volume was soon followed by DashielPs second introductory text, Fundamentals of General Psychology (1937), in which Dashiell repeated his definition of 1928, but with a minor amendment: The tissue conditions con stituting drives were now described as "local and general" (p. 99). Other relatively incidental statements were made during the remaining pre Hullian years, but there were also two substantial utterances. The first of these was a paper by Seward and Seward (1937); the second was Skinner's book, The Behavior of Organisms (1938). The Sewards added force to the growing emphasis on a behavioral notion of "drive." It was their position that: A drive is an activity of the total organism resulting from a persistent dis equilibrium, (p. 351) The "disequilibrium" they had in mind entailed much more than mere homeostatic imbalance. Thus, although the nature of the disequilibrium might be "more or less verifiable" (p. 351) in some cases (e.g., in hunger or in the regula tion of body temperature), it was also true that [Disequilibrium] may ... be set up in the central adjustors by associative processes, as in much of the purposive behavior characteristic of higher forms. Here for the present the state of disequilibrium must be assumed rather than described, (pp. 351-352) Perhaps the most notable feature of the Sewards' definition, aside from its logical fragility, was its abandonment of the concept of "need"?and indeed even of "tissue condition," as the latter term was (and still is) conventionally understood. The drive state might or might not reflect deprivation, and it might even depend solely on patterns of associative connections. The notions of "primary drive" and "secondary drive" were thus fused together to form a single concept. In the second major effort of the time, Skinner (1938) added impressive detail to his sketch of 1932. He began by re-establishing his basic position: 79</page><page sequence="10">Kendon Smith Drive is . . . not to be described as a "desire" or "craving" or as any other state directed toward the future, (p. 373) Drive [is] Not a Stimulus, (p. 374) The problem of drive arises because much of the behavior of an organism shows an apparent variability. A rat does not always respond to food placed before it, and a factor called its "hunger" is invoked by way of explanation, (p. 341) In measuring the strength of a drive we are in reality only measuring strength of behavior . . . The "drive" is a hypothetical state interpolated between operation and behavior and is not actually required in a descrip tive system. The concept is useful, however, as a device for expressing the complex relation that obtains between various similarly effective opera tions and a group of co-varying forms of behavior, (p. 368) Operationally, then, the degree to which drive was present was to be measured through strength of behavior; but the measurement was not simple and direct, as Skinner explained: The observations upon which the concepts of drive and conditioning are based are essentially of the same kind. So far as any one reflex is con cerned, we observe merely a change in its strength occurring as the result of the manipulation of some variable. Such variables may be divided into the classes called "drive" and "conditioning" but their effects upon behavior itself offer no useful criteria for differentiation. When we turn from the immediate strength of a reflex to its reserve, a difference is revealed. Conditioning involves the size of the reserve, but drive concerns the relation between the size and the momentary strength. The operation of reinforcement increases the reserve in a definite way, while the opera tion of feeding or fasting changes the strength without influencing the reserve, (p. 379) Thus, Without altering the total number of available responses, a change in drive may alter the rate of elicitation of an op?rant from a minimal to a maximal value, (p. 27) Drive is not the only organismic condition which has the effect described, however. "Facilitation and certain kinds of emotion [also] increase the strength, while inhibition and certain other kinds of emotion decrease it without modifying the reserve" (p. 27)?to say nothing of "certain drugs, fatigue, age, and so on" (p. 376). Accordingly, if a physiological state is to qualify as a drive, there must be met an additional specification?namely, that the animal has undergone depriva tion (see, e.g., pp. 369, 371, 372, 375, 380, and 402). Although Skinner did tend to think, in 1938, largely in terms of food deprivation and food reinforcement, the element of biological need does not appear to have been important to him. Rather, he seems to have been saying that the state called "drive" is one which may or may not arise when an organism is deprived of some reinforcer; and that, 80</page><page sequence="11">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept if the reinforcer has already been used in establishing some "reflex," the presence and intensity of the drive state, if it has in fact developed, can be inferred from the strength of that "reflex"?providing always that nothing has happened to alter the "reflex reserve." It is worthy of attention, incidentally, that Skinner's mode of thought, as much as Tolman's and Hull's, thus honored a distinction between "learning" and "performance." Historically speaking, Skinner's volume of 1938 did not have great contem porary impact. One may conjecture as to reasons; but in any case Skinner was at the time, from the standpoint of the discussion of "drive," simply adding another voice. In essence, furthermore, that voice was not contentious. Skinner, like others, was not particularly concerned about underlying "needs," and he too was giving stress to purely behavioral criteria. It is true that his behavioral criteria actually differed in some respects from those usually invoked, but that is a point to be considered later on. Beyond the substantial efforts of Seward and Seward and of Skinner, as just described, there remain for our consideration in the pre-Hullian period three relatively minor contributions. Minor though they may have been, they never theless came from major sources: Woodworth, Miller and Dollard, and Tolman. Woodworth published the fourth edition of Psychology in 1940, and again his thinking had evolved appreciably. He was now using the terms "drive" and "motive" interchangeably, and drive/motive had become a distributor of energy rather than a source. Its function was the selective instigation of behavior: A motive . . . isa state or set of the individual which disposes him for cer tain behavior and for seeking certain goals, (p. 368) A motive, or drive, releases some of the organism 's store of energy and directs it into a certain channel, (p. 369) Woodworth then went on to describe drives for such things as exploration, manipulation, mastery, and submission. Miller and Dollard's semi-popular volume of 1941 embodied their often quoted declaration that A drive is a strong stimulus which impels action. Any stimulus can become a drive if it is made strong enough, (p. 18) This assertion stood in sharp contrast to Skinner's insistence that drives were not stimuli, and it was later qualified materially (Dollard &amp; Miller, 1950). Meanwhile, in 1941, Miller and Dollard (pp. 18-19) went on to allude to the "primary or innate drives" of pain, thirst, hunger, fatigue, and sex. Tolman's paper of 1943, finally, represented a sort of an ultimate elaboration of his earlier thought. In a curious way, it also constituted something of an elaboration of Woodworth's (1940) new view. The "first-order" and "second order" drives (Tolman, 1932) were now commingled as "The Biological Drives" (p. 504), and Tolman's concern was to develop a scheme for "the routes . . . through which ... the energy from the basic Biological Drives gets converted . . .into the Social Techniques [or "Social Drives"] and . . . Behavior Propensities" (p. 505; cf. p. 504). He was not greatly concerned about the nature 81</page><page sequence="12">Kendon Smith of the "energy" in question, referring to it casually as "energy, or tension, or libido, or drive-force (or whatever you want to call it)" (p. 511). Miller and Dollard (1941, pp. 18-19) had implied rather strongly that a linkage existed between biological needs and primary drives. It is clear, however, that neither Woodworth nor Tolman saw any particular connection, even though both men would undoubtedly have agreed with Skinner's observation, "That there are physiological conditions correlated with all aspects of behavior no one will be like ly to question" (Skinner, 1932, p. 34). Both Woodworth and Tolman seem to have viewed drives as sources or purveyors of some sort of energy, and to have seen them as direction in effect. Beyond such uncertain interpretations it is dif ficult to move, however, in dealing with material as poetic as theirs. With Tolman's paper of 1943, the period now under historical review came to a close. The term "drive" had been in currency for twenty-five years. Plainly there had been some variation in its usage; but there seems all the same to have emerged by 1943 a kind of consensus as to what the term stood for. That consen sus may be called the "classical" or "traditional" concept of "drive." The following subsection of the present essay attempts to verbalize it. The Classical Concept of "Drive" There are several ways of reducing a concept to words. The one which seems most simple and appropriate in the present instance is that of flat allegation and subsequent defense. Accordingly, I shall now assert that the classical idea of "drive" was basically that of (1) a bodily state which (2) rendered the organism reinforcible and which (3) instigated behavior. I shall try to justify each of those three stipulations below. Drive as a bodily state. Among the definitions just catalogued, there seems to be little dissent from the proposition that drive is a bodily condition of some sort. Warden's demurrer of 1931 was but faint, and even Skinner (1932, 1938) found the proposition acceptable in principle. There was some tendency early in the period under review to assume that drives always flowed from vital needs. With the passage of time, however, that tendency faded; and by 1943 it was in fact the generally accepted view that drives and needs were different and conceptually unrelated phenomena (cf. Young, 1936, pp. 80-81). Miller and Dollard (1941), in their quasi-identification of drives with needs, seem to have represented something of a reversal in this trend. Actual ly, however, it is more likely that they represented an anticipation of what Hull, with whom they were of course closely associated, was to publish in 1943; in a sense their book of 1941 is more accurately classified as "post-Hullian" than as "pre-Hullian." As to whether or not drives specifically consist of stimuli, or even involve stimuli, the various usages differed widely. It is possible that this lack of concur rence reflected the empirical controversy, vigorous during the 1930's and 1940's, between the "local" and the "central" theories of drive (cf. Morgan, 1943). At any rate, the disagreement was real. In sum, then, drive was seen in 1943 as a bodily state having no particular con 82</page><page sequence="13">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept nection with organic need; whether or not it was stimulational in character remained moot. Drive as a state of reinforcibility. Among the treatments of "drive" surveyed, there was little if any explicit reference to the property of reinforcibility. There were, however, many descriptions of drives as "impelling forces," "urges," or "propensities," and of the "directional" or "selective" effects they have upon behavior. Terms of this sort are manifestly figurative. When we speak of the "direction" behavior is taking, we do not mean that the organism is moving to the south or to the northwest; and there are no "forces" propelling the animal as if it were a sailboat. What this kind of metaphor is meant to convey is that a drive is always "for" something, that the behavior it produces is "docile" (Tolman, 1932, pp. 14ff., 30ff., 442) with respect to some state of affairs. It consequently seems to me that the literal statement of the underlying idea here is that drive is a bodily condition which renders the organism reinforcible. It is illuminating in this connection to go back to such early discussions of "drive" as those of Moss (1924), Carr (1925), Dashiell (1928), and Warden (1931). In reading them, one senses the transition from "instinct" to "drive" which was taking place at the time (cf. Herrnstein, 1972). Instincts had been envisaged as states which, even in the absence of learning, endowed an animal's behavior with a "goal-directed" quality: They were thought to produce not mere ly mechanical, forced movements but rather the kind of behavior which was sensitive to the momentary environment and which worked within it to realize some specific effect?securing a mate, constructing a nest, or what not. And a fundamental question among the early drive theorists was that of the extent to which drives, too, prompted "directed" (which was to say "goal-directed") behavior. The answer soon given was that, in the absence of learning, drives pro vided little direction or none at all; but that, as learning took place, drives tended to assume a stronger and stronger directive influence. It is difficult to see in such an account anything other than a portrayal of the reinforcemental process at work. 2 Although the drive state was thus characterized, albeit implicitly, as one which renders the organism susceptible to reinforcement, the early theorists did not fur ther agree upon a particular mechanism of reinforcement. Many of them seem to have assumed almost casually that reinforcement must be a function of drive reduction. Others, notably Woodworth and Tolman, appear to have been inhospitable to such an idea. In truth, there is little in the early literature to suggest that the question was actually a pressing one at the time. A final point with respect to reinforcibility as an indicium of drive has to do with Skinner's special treatment of the matter. Accounts of driven behavior of the period of 1918 to 1943 typically specify the reinforcemental process from begin ning to end. Thus, the animal in a drive state starts out at a point where its 2Bindra, although he did not at the time subscribe to the notion of "drive," also maintained strongly that "direction" represents reinforcibility (1959, pp. 66ff.). For more restrained support, see MacCorquodale (1955). 83</page><page sequence="14">Kendon Smith behavior is still largely unformed; then there is an encounter with a reinforcer; and then, with repeated reinforcement, the behavior gradually approaches a high level of efficiency. Once efficient behavior has been thoroughly learned, it appears and disappears with the drive, because it has been reinforced only in the presence of the drive state. Tolman in particular might have objected to the words employed in this account, but even he would have been obliged to agree with its operational substance. It is of interest to note, though, that Skinner's 1938 treatment of drive was unique in ignoring the first phases of this sequence. The presence or absence of hunger (for instance) was to be ascertained from the presence or absence of an already well-developed "reflex" which was instrumental in obtaining food. Such an approach was not inconsistent with the notion of drive as a state of reinforci bility; but the question remains as to how drive was to be identified in an untutored organism. To summarize: Granting the present paper's interpretation of such terms as "direction," "selectivity," "propensity," and "impelling force," there was firm agreement during the period under review that the state called "drive" was one of reinforcibility. There was no such agreement as to the specific mechanism of reinforcement. Drive as an instigator of behavior. Although it is conceivable than an animal in a bodily state of reinforcibility might remain unmoved by that condition, the pre Hullian treatments of "drive" did not envisage such a case. In general they pic tured drive as a source of what is often called "arousal," "activation," or "energization." But those words were not entirely appropriate. The customary lists of drives invariably included something like "fatigue" or "sleep," and neither exhaustion nor somnolence qualifies as arousal. It will be remembered too that Carr specifically denied the arousal function, preferring to think of drive as "a relative ly persistent stimulus that dominates the behavior" (1925, p. 73); and that Wood worth came to think less in terms of behavioral arousal than in terms of behavioral direction (1934, p. 302; 1940, pp. 368-369).3 Even if we cannot always take "activation" in its literal sense, however, there does still seem to remain here the nub of a genuine idea?namely, that the drive state instigates behavior of some sort. Indeed, it is unlikely the language would have tolerated a term as dynamic as "drive" for a state which was essentially impotent. By those among the early theorists who regarded drive as a stimulus in any case, the instigational function was obviously taken for granted. Woodworth (1918) was willing to think not only in terms of stimuli; he also described the activation or inhibition of one neural entity by another and even the energizing effects of consummatory impulses and of instinct. Tolman conveyed the general notion of instigation at a phenomenal level with terms like "urge" and "demand." Skinner was again anomalous. Many passages in The Behavior of 3It now becomes relevant to point out that Woodworth also suggested at the outset that drive may have an inhibitory function (1918, pp. 41-42). 84</page><page sequence="15">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept Organisms (1938) can be read to imply that the drive state has an autonomous in stigational function; but Skinner also frequently seems to be saying that drive does not have such a function?that it merely brings about a passive sensitization of the circuitry subserving one family of "reflexes" or another. One can see significance in either view, especially in the latter. What the overall treatment suggests most of all, however, is that Skinner had not yet developed a clear position on the question. It would seem fair to say, in summary, that the drive state was regarded by all parties as being in some sense an "instigator" of behavior. The onset of a drive was presumed to speed up the stream of behavior, to slow it down, or to change its direction. Conclusion. It appears that the original assertion, that the consensual notion of "drive" which had developed by 1943 was that of "a bodily state which renders the organism reinforcible and which instigates behavior," is supportable. That notion was earlier dubbed the "classical" concept of drive. It is noteworthy that the classical concept did not appeal to: (1) organic need, (2) stimuli as essential elements of the drive state, (3) the invariability of behavioral activation, or (4) the reduction of drive as the basis for reinforcement. As we shall now see, it was in fact c. l. Hull who sought to incorporate within the definition of "drive" crucial reference to those four characteristics. Hull's Construct of "Drive" ? 1943-1952 Principles of Behavior, the book many regard as Hull's chef-d'oeuvre, made its appearance in 1943. It described a psychological theory which was subsequent ly elaborated, and considerably modified, in two additional volumes: Essentials of Behavior (1951) and A Behavior System (1952). A salient feature of Hull's theory was his definition and utilization of the variable "D," or "drive." That construct has been of first importance to systematic psychology, and to it the present section of this paper is devoted. Inasmuch as Hull's views are well known, their discussion is made as brief as possible. As was particularly evident in the 1943 volume, Hull's thinking was closely guided by a somewhat idealized conception of the process of organic evolution. He was thus led to postulate from the outset a direct, cause-and-effect relation ship between need and drive as he perceived them. For Hull, a need consisted of some deficit in "any of the commodities or conditions necessary for individual or species survival" (1943, p. 17; italics added). Needs were thought typically to have two effects: (1) they probably "activate more or less characteristic receptor organs much as do external environmental forces" (1943, p. 18), and (2) they "motivate or drive . . . activity . . . [T]hey are regarded as producing primary animal drives" (1943, p. 57). Hence, drive was totally rooted in need?although it is important to note that Hull's definition of "need" went far beyond the customary, literal meaning of "an organic deficit." As can be seen, drive proper was not to be identified with the predicated activation of receptor organs. Drive was generated by a separate and rather sur prising process. The state of need was pictured as altering the composition of the 85</page><page sequence="16">Kendon Smith blood (1943, pp. 240-241); and, when the blood then bathes the neural structures which constitute the anatomical bases of habit (sHr), the conductivity of these structures is augmented. ... It must be noted at once, however, that sensitizing a habit structure does not mean that this alone is sufficient to evoke the reaction. . . . Sensitization merely gives the relevant neural tissue, upon the occurrence of an adequate set of receptor discharges, an augmented facility in routing these impulses to the reactions previously conditioned to them or connected by native (inherited) growth processes. This implies to a certain extent the undif ferentiated nature of drive in general. . . . [A]U drives seem to be alike in their powers of sensitizing acquired receptor-effector connections (1943, p. 241). It might be said that Hull was somewhat less emphatic elsewhere, even in 1943, about the totally undifferentiated effect of drive upon all learned responses (e.g., 1943, p. 252). To be noted also is the fact that Hull did not stipulate th^ the effect of drive was necessarily energizing. He referred to "augmented conductivity," "sensitization," and "augmented facility in routing"?not to "activation" or "arousal." If past learning and present stimulation were appropriate, therefore, the state of drive would presumably enhance tendencies toward inhibition, passivity, or sleep rather than tendencies toward positive activity. The drive process in itself was involved in a complex way with the "direction" of behavior. To begin with, it affected unlearned responses: As part of the need syndrome, acting in concert with a correlated receptor input, a state of drive might tend to enhance selectively the operation of certain primitive, innate pathways; behavior having some evolutionary likelihood of reducing the need might thereby be emitted (1943, pp. 58-60, 66, 240-241). In the formation of learned responses, drive per se might or might not have been important. Learning was seen as the attachment of new responses to a correlated receptor input (including the "drive stimulus") by a reinforcemental process. Hull was uncertain, though, as to whether reinforcement was brought about by a reduction in "need," and hence presumably in drive, or simply by a reduction in the intensity of the drive stimulus (1943, p. 81). Formally, he was inclined to favor the latter alternative (1943, p. 81); nevertheless, he tended throughout Principles of Behavior to speak broadly of reinforcement by "reduction in need." If one accepts need reduction, and therefore drive reduction, as the essential reinforcer, drive in itself becomes important in setting the directional quality of behavior. In a given learning situa tion, those responses which have the effect of diminishing drive are the ones ultimately selected; the behavior is "docile" with respect to drive reduction. If one chooses diminution in drive stimulus as the reinforcing event, drive proper is not important in the shaping of behavior. In either case, it should be noted, drive has no role in the elicitation of behavior once it is learned; it is the drive stimulus which determines the nature of the immediate response. Such, then, was the way Hull envisaged the drive process in 1943. His views of that time having tended to retain a force of their own, they are entitled to a 86</page><page sequence="17">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept measure of critical attention of their own; and such attention will be given later in the paper. It seems most expeditious just now, however, to turn to Hull's later thinking, as represented by Essentials of Behavior (1951) and A Behavior System (1952). The former volume was brief, but it constituted an important statement of Hull's fundamental premises at the time. The 1952 book, more substantial physically, was also more derivative and empirical in content. The change which had occurred in 1951 was almost dramatic. Hull had decid ed to forego neurological speculation: "Our theory of behavior must at bottom be almost entirely molar" (1951, pp. 5-6). "Need" was defined as before (p. 15), and needs were again said to "constitute conditions of primary drive (Cd)" (p. 33). But now: Drive itself (D) is a quantitative intervening variable lying between the Cd and the response (R). Ordinarily these drive conditions [i.e., Cd rather than D], if intense enough, release innate behavioral activities (sUr) which tend to rectify the biological emergency involved. Even when very weak they "motivate" habits, particularly those which in the past have been associated with these or similar conditions. As a rule the vigor of the response evoked is a positive increasing function of the intensity of the condition which sets it in motion. (1951, p. 33; italics added) Although Hull had thus moved strongly toward a nonreductive posture, he did make a number of assertions, albeit rather cryptic ones, about the physiology of drive: A more or less persistent stimulation (Sd) arises. This drive state (Sd) evokes some of hierarchy of unlearned impulses. (1951, p. 15; italics added) Apparently an Sd accompanies all true drives . . . [T]he principle of stimulus-intensity dynamism . . . implies that Sd has appreciable dynamic or moving, i.e., motive, powers in its own right which are clearly related to primary motivation. (1951, p. 39; italics added) Each drive condition (Cd) generates a characteristic drive stimulus (Sd). (1951, p. 39) One gains the impression that, without entirely forsaking his earlier notion of D as a state of neural facilitation, Hull had now moved to provide Sd with drive pro perties of its own. It is consonant with such an interpretation that diminution in Sd itself now became, unequivocally, the basis for reinforcement (p. 15). Conso nant also was Hull's further retreat from the position that drive was an undif ferentiated facilitator: At least some drive conditions tend partially to motivate into action habits which have been set up on the basis of different drive conditions. (1951, p. 40; 1952, p. 7; italics added) Not to be overlooked, finally, is a premise implicit in several of the quotations above?namely, that the dynamic effect of the Sd was an outright increase in organismic arousal or activation. The subtlety of "augmented facility in routing" was now gone. 87</page><page sequence="18">Kendon Smith It is evident that, even by 1952, Hull had not brought his ideas with respect to "drive" into sharp focus. One is nonetheless left with the impression that drive as a phenomenon was now closely identified with the drive stimulus, Sd; that Sd arose from some state of need and evoked behavior which was vigorous in propor tion to the intensity of Sd itself; and that reinforcement occurred upon a decrease in that intensity. Formally, of course, "drive" was defined as an intervening variable, one which depended upon deprivation and had the effect of elevating the curve of acquisition without changing its growth parameter (1951, pp. 33-36). The fundamental agreement between Hull and Skinner (1938, 1953), when the matter is stated in such terms, is rather striking; the principal difference between them lies in the fact that Hull took the early phases of the learning process into account, whereas Skinner did not. It is evident from the foregoing precise of Hull's handling of the concept of "drive" in 1943 and in 1951-1952 that he dealt with the matter in two different ways at the two different times. Both treatments have tended to survive in the literature; consequently, it seems worthwhile to consider not only the final, 1951-1952 formulation but the 1943 version as well, vis-a-vis the traditional notion of "drive." It seems likely that in 1943 Hull believed he was carrying the essence of the traditional notion of "drive" over into his own system. It is significant that the label itself was preserved. As he must have realized he was doing, however, Hull proceeded to amend and specialize the concept, which had been virtually theory free, into one closely adapted to his own systematic requirements. He insisted upon rooting drives in "individual or species" needs, although, once the defini tion of "need" is extended beyond the realm of the sheer survival of the individual organism, the word becomes virtually meaningless. Actually "need" seems to have served Hull mainly as an esthetically satisfying connection with the principles of evolution. Perhaps it also served to emphasize the physical nature of the drive state. In any case, Hull certainly agreed in 1943 that drive was a bodily condition?but he specified immediately that it was, in particular, a condition of cortical potentiation, accompanied by a drive stimulus. He agreed, too, that drive was a state of reinforcibility; but he stipulated the reduction of drive as the exact mechanism of reinforcement. Strictly speaking, Hull's drive proper, the brain state, was not an instigator of behavior. By itself, it produced no responses; its function was merely that of enhancing the effects of whatever stimuli might be present. It appears all the same that Hull took it for granted that some stimuli? especially drive stimuli?would always be present. Because the net effect of stimuli plus central state would be the prompting of some sort of behavior, it is possible to regard Hull's drive as having been effectively an instigational phenomenon, too. Hence, at least in reconciliatory interpretation, Hull's "drive" of 1943 did not flatly contradict the traditional conception; but it did leave the theoretical neutrality of the latter far behind and move into specifics which were plainly controversial. Hull's final position (1951, 1952) was quite clearly a special case of the conven 88</page><page sequence="19">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept tional notion of "drive." At the same time, it was perhaps even more highly con strained than the 1943 version had been. Drive was now seen essentially as a stimulus condition, a bodily state which was as acceptable logically as the more complex one pictured in 1943. Drive remained a condition of reinforcibility, and the mode of reinforcement remained that of drive reduction. As simply a stimulus, however, Hull's drive state of 1951-1952 qualified unequivocally as an instigator of behavior and thus unequivocally as an instance of the drive of tradi tion. The increased constraint was imposed by the fact that Hull now saw drive as an arouser, in the narrow sense of the term, rather than more broadly as a poten tiator of all behavior. Hull's concept of "drive" thus became in the end a highly particularized version of the traditional idea. The particulars, furthermore, were distinctly problematical. Not only did the continued insistence on "need" at least sound absurd; but drive-as-stimulus was steadily losing credence; drive-as activator had been rejected from the start; and drive-reduction-as-reinforcer had always been under question. Manifestly it was Hull who contributed to the idea of "drive" precisely those features about which complaint has arisen. They were not to any appreciable degree present in the concept which had already evolved within psychology by 1943. The question which now remains is therefore obvious: To what extent were Hull's contributions accepted, to become a part of the conventional notion of "drive"? It is to that question that the next section of this essay addresses itself. "Drive" After Hull In order to answer the question just raised, the present section must examine the views of a considerable number of psychologists and draw conclusions as best it can from the substance of those views. The most economical way of proceeding with this task seems to be that of exchanging the strictly chronological plan which has been followed so far for one which organizes the more recent historical material, including that related to writers other than Hull during the period of 1943 to 1952, around the three components of the traditional idea of "drive." We have just seen how those components were treated by Hull. The aim now will be to indicate as briefly as possible how each has fared, Hull's own treatments aside, since 1943. Along with the advantage of succinctness, this format has the obvious disadvantage that it tends to break up individual contributions and to present their parts separately and out of context. To minimize this shortcoming, an at tempt will be made to supply background material as seems necessary. To be dealt with in the following three sub-sections, then, are the fate of: (1) drive as a bodily state, (2) the property of reinforcibility, and (3) the question of the instigation of behavior. A fourth sub-section will attempt to provide an ap propriate summary and conclusion. Drive as a Bodily State There has been no rear dissent, since 1943, from the proposition that drive is a bodily state of some sort. It will be recalled that Skinner was willing to allow the proposition in 1938; he reiterated his accedence in 1953 (p. 145). Although Hull 89</page><page sequence="20">Kendon Smith had referred to drive as an "intervening variable," he had gone on to describe "these drive conditions" and their physiological effects (1951, p. 33). In 1961 J. F. Hall also chose to regard drives as intervening variables, but the overall trend of his discussion indicates that he too was not speaking puristically (1961, esp. p. 35). As to the absence of any necessary connection between physiological need and drive, tfiere has continued to exist virtual unanimity. After 1943 Hull and Spence (e.g., 1956) seem to have been the only real proponents of the idea. Tolman (1949, 1951) went on using the term "need," but not in reference to biological re quirements; indeed, he decided in 1951 to apply the term to what he had until then been calling "drive." Miller and Dollard had implied a linkage in 1941; in 1950, however, Dollard and Miller (fn., pp. 30-31) argued against such a view. In addi tion to Dollard and Miller, there have been several others who have opposed the notion of a correlation between need and drive (Brown, 1961, pp. 67ff.; Fowler, 1965, p. 14; Hall, 1961, pp. 39-40; Morgan, 1957, 1959; Woodworth, 1958, p. 58; Young, 161, pp. 123-124, 127, 142-143), but the usual course has been simply to ignore the question. It is of interest that Dashiell, who had based his definitions of 1928 and 1937 upon "tissue-conditions," chose to move in 1949 to "dis equilibrium ... of the body as a whole" (p. 141); and that Skinner made a point in 1953 (p. 142) of stressing, to the contrary, the elusiveness of such notions as "equilibrium" and "homeostasis." Some division of opinion as to whether or not drive is a stimulus has persisted. In the main, however, the view that it is not has gained ascendance. Bunch did speak out in 1958 in favor of the classical concept of drive as a stimulus; and Postman's suggestion of 1953 that the general energizing compo nent of Hull's 1952 system might be dropped, to leave Sd as the totality of the drive state, probably amount to much the same thing (cf., also Estes, 1958). Miller and Dollard's flat assertion of 1941 (p. 18), "A drive is a strong stimulus which impels action," was transmuted by 1950, however, into the more cautious state ment, "Strong stimuli which impel action are drives" (Dollard &amp; Miller, 1950, p. 30); and the latter version was then further qualified to the point of near-negation (Dollard &amp; Miller, 1950, fn., pp. 30-31). In 1959 Tolman employed the term "drive-stimulations" "to distinguish . . . internal conditions which have proper ties both similar to and different from those of ordinary stimuli" (p. 101). The equivocality thus evidenced by Dollard and Miller and by Tolman may also be seen among those who remained within the tradition of Hull's system of 1943 and who thus thought of stimuli as necessary attendants of the drive state but as not of its essence (Brown, 1953, 1961; F?rber, 1954; Spence, 1956). Although many writers have simply remained silent on the issue, there have been numerous declarations that drives are not stimuli. Typical have been those of Dashiell (1949, pp. 141-148), Skinner (1953, pp. 144-145), MacCorquodale (1955), Morgan (1957, 1959), Woodworth (1958), and Young (1961, pp. 106-107). Some of those declarations seem to have meant merely that drives were not by definition stimuli?that the facts were open to empirical adjudication but that in any case 90</page><page sequence="21">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept the concept did not depend essentially upon the element of sensory stimulation. In other instances the assertions seemed more dogmatic, as if an empirical decision had already been reached. All things considered, the conventional view appears not to have changed very much since 1943. Drive is still regarded universally as a bodily state, and generally as one which is logically unrelated to the state of need. The role of stimulational processes remainds debatable, but there seems to have developed in recent years a tendency toward its minimization. The Property of Reinforcibility There is no doubt that it has remained the conventional practice to specify reinforcibility as a crucial aspect of drive, even though the specification has con tinued to be laid down in many different ways. Thus, Woodworth and Marquis (1947, p. 337; see also p. 327) spoke of "a set which predisposes the individual for certain activities and for seeking certain goals," and Tolman (1949, 1951) favored "propensity" or "disposition." Similarly broad characterizations were offered again by Woodworth in 1958 and Tolman in 1959. Somewhat more definite emphasis to direction and persistence in behavior was given by Bunch (1958) and by Hall (1961); and both Nissen (1954) and MacCorquodale (1955) were quite specific, seeing drive as the basis of instrumental learning and reinforcement. Skinner (1953) restated his position of 1938; the latter has already been described in some detail, and it has been interpreted as one form of the assertion that the drive state is fundamentally a condition of reinforcibility. Herrnstein has lately emphasized, in an exegesis of Skinner's views, the validity of such an interpreta tion (Herrnstein, 1977). From 1918 onward until quite recently, it was generally assumed that an organism in a state of drive is not only reinforcible, but reinforcible by the par ticular circumstance of a diminution in the drive state itself. That assumption was embodied in many of the early definitions of "drive"?although not, it will be recalled, in all of them?and it was of course accepted and elaborated by Hull. There have been several since Hull who have accepted the premise and have associated it with their respective conceptions of "drive." The following instances may be mentioned: Dashiell (1949), Dollard and Miller (1950), Brown (1953, 1961), F?rber (1954, 1955), Spence (1956), Wittenborn (1957), Morgan (1959), Miller (1959), and Young (1961). In some of these cases, it should be said, the drive-reduction proposition has been tempered in one way or another. F?rber (1954, 1955) regarded reinforcibility by diminution as merely one of two alter native criteria by which a state of drive could be identified; the other was a general potentiating effect upon behavior. Miller (1959) expressed misgivings about bas ing his own definition of "drive" upon the principle of reinforcement by drive reduction, and he indicated his readiness to change his views as new data might require. Finally, Young for many years appealed to "hedonic processes" as well as drive reduction in his theory of reinforcement (1961; cf. also 1967). Among those clearly opposed to the notion of reinforcement by drive reduc tion, one woud expect to find E. C. Tolman. Tolman did indeed reject the princi 91</page><page sequence="22">Kendon Smith pie, but not quite as flatly as he might have done. His book of 1932 related drives closely to physiological "quiescences to-be-reached and . . . disturbances to-be avoided" (p. 271), and by 1959 he had decided that he "would now tend to accept the Law of Effect," specifically in his explanation of the "acquisition of beliefs" (p. 125). He nevertheless made it plain, in his summing-up of 1959, that he was not then and presumably never had been a drive reductionist: I do not believe that the rat (or the man) learns because after each trial the need [i.e., drive] ... is reduced. An animal is not learning to get to need reduction. The "effects" which favor learning ... are not those of need reduction, because a need may often not be reduced but enhanced. These effects are rather the mere positive or negative values of the terminal goal stimuli, simply as such. (p. 126; second set of italics added) There have been others besides Tolman who have favored the idea of drive as a state of reinforcibility but who have rejected the subsidiary premise that reinforce ment comes only with the alleviation of drive. One was Harlow (1953a, 1953b, 1953c), who, although he paid cryptic tribute to "temporospatial continguity of a previously neutral stimulus with the response-eliciting stimulus . . . [as] . . . stressed by Pavlov and by Guthrie" as the sovereign rule of learning (1953b, p. 46), nevertheless spoke continually in terms of "drives"?and "drives" were con ditions aroused by internal or external stimulation which rendered the animal rein forcible by specific behavioral consequences: food, water, copulation, explora tion, manipulation, or affection, for example (1953b, 1953c). Like Tolman, Harlow insisted that "Goal stimuli . . . frequently lead to drive facilitation and increased activity" (1953c, p. 23; italics added). MacCorquodale's review of 1955 saw "the performability of the reinforcement operation" as the common element among diverse concepts of "drive" (p. 30); but the same review also gave pro minence to a body of evidence which seriously challenged drive reduction as the sole mechanism of reinforcement. And there is of course a school of thought, ex emplified by Maslow (e.g., 1955, 1971), which sees at least some important primary drives as bases for reinforcement but as nevertheless virtually unchanging in their intensity. Both Hebb (1955) and Berlyne (1967, 1969) also proposed that drive enhance ment as well as drive reduction could be reinforcing. A logical consequence of their particular view, however, is that drive is no longer, strictly speaking, a condi tion obligatory for reinforcement. A brief consideration of Hebb's approach will indicate what is meant. In 1955, Hebb wrote to rescind an earlier view (Hebb, 1949; see below). Im pressed by the findings of the 1950's with respect to the "arousal system," Hebb saw "arousal in this sense . . . [as] . . . synonymous with a general drive state" (1955, p. 249). That drive state, like the somewhat similar one proposed by Hull in 1943, was accompanied by stimuli acting as cues. Unlike Hull's drive of 1943, however, Hebb's of 1955 did not necessarily confer reinforcibility by its presence; and neither did its absence necessarily imply non-reinforcibility. For Hebb, rein forcement was a matter of the organism's moving toward an optimal level of arousal. An organism already at that level could not be rewarded, and an 92</page><page sequence="23">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept organism at a hypothetical zero level of arousal quite possibly could. Drive thus had no imperative relation to reinforcement?although, it should be pointed out, neither the zero level nor the optimal level of drive seemed to be regarded as a serious practical eventuality. In his textbook of 1958, Hebb maintained his stand of 1955. In his later texts (1966, 1972), he abandoned the term "drive" but retained a general emphasis upon arousal. Meanwhile, in 1967 and 1969, Berlyne had adopted a position somewhat similar to the one Hebb had taken in 1955 and 1958. Hebb and Berlyne thus gave expression to one form of the idea that drive is not even a condition of reinforcibility in the first place. In general, as has been in dicated, that idea has seldom been expressed. In still another form, however, it can also be found in the substance of a dialogue between Dethier (1964, 1966) and Teitelbaum (1966, 1967), who seemed to concur in a view of "drive" which makes it hardly more than "an internal state which provokes instinctive, automatic behavior." For behavior which is either learned or malleable by learning, the term "motivation" was considered appropriate. The kinship between this mode of thought and that typical of the ethological tradition is evident. Finally there is a genre of behavior theory which depends upon elaboration of the pioneer proposals of E. R. Guthrie (see Guthrie, 1952, 1959). Represented by such writers as Sheffield, Estes, and Atkinson and Birch, it has made full use of the term "drive" to denote a condition of non-directional "excitement" or "arousal." The term thus seems, at least superficially, to carry no overtones of reinforcibility. Like Guthrie, however, the writers in question have typically ended up (with varying degrees of realization) at an "empirical" law of effect; and it thus appears that even their "drive" is, in point of fact, a state which permits of reinforcement. An argument to this end is set forth in some detail later, under the topic of incentive motivation. If we may assume for the time being that that argu ment will prove to be persuasive, it follows that the position taken by this group does not actually tend to vitiate the generalization that "drive" refers to a bodily state which renders the organism reinforcible. It has in fact become evident in the course of the foregoing review that excep tions to that generalization are few. The pre-Hullian (and Hullian) consensus in favor of "reinforcibility" as an important aspect of "drive" has maintained itself. The suspicion that reinforcement is not always a matter of drive diminution has also persisted, however, and no real agreement as to the mechanism of rein forcement is yet discernible. The Instigation of Behavior If "drive" has thus retained the meaning of "a bodily state of reinforcibility," has it also retained that of "an instigator of behavior"? To say that it has is almost to mouth a truism; all the same, there have been certain subtleties in the way "instigation" has been conceptualized, and they should be recognized briefly. Commonly it has been said that drive "arouses," "activates," "energizes," or "excites." It will be recalled that Hull finally accepted such a proposition (Hull, 93</page><page sequence="24">Kendon Smith 1951, 1952), and many others also favored it (e.g., Bunch, 1958; Dashiell, 1949; Dethier, 1964, 1966; Harlow, 1953a, 1953b, 1953c; Hebb, 1955; Irwin, 1961; Morgan, 1957, 1959; Sheffield, 1966a, 1966b; Teitelbaum, 1967; Young, 1961). Clearly this is a bloc which cannot be ignored in defining the contemporary view of drive. Granting that fact, one still wonders whether many of those who have subscribed to the doctrine of drive as an arouser might not have agreed, upon second thought, with reservations like the one expressed by Wood worth: "Drive activates the organism . . . The fatigue drive is an obvious exception" (1958, p. 60). The "obvious exceptions" of the drives for rest and sleep were in fact men tioned earlier in the present paper. Other instances of drives which evoke quiescence are indisputable. One thinks of the hypertensive patient who has ac quired a strong relaxation drive, for example, or the wounded soldier who saves his life by desperately "playing dead" for hours. Such challenges to a purely ac tivational view of "drive" are perhaps better met by schemes like Hull's earlier one (1943), in which the state of drive strengthened all the behavioral tendencies aroused by a given situation, those toward inhibition as well as those toward ac tivation. Notions of this kind were also proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950), Brown (1953, 1961), Nissen (1954), Spence (1956), and Miller (1959). F?rber (1954, 1955), as has already been mentioned, took the interesting position that drive could be recognized either by such a capacity to potentiate behavior, or alternatively, by a tendency to make the animal reinforcible. There have been others who seemed well-disposed toward the idea of drive as a potentiator rather than drive as an activator, but who thought of the potentiating effect of drive as being restricted to a comparatively narrow band of related responses rather than as being totally undifferentiated. It will be recalled that even Hull tended to move from a position of generality in this matter toward one of greater specificity; it ap pears that J. S. Brown did so, too (see Madsen, 1974, fn. p. 203); and what were in effect notions of restricted potentiation were also suggested by Beach (1942, 1956), Skinner (1953), Harlow (1953c), Morgan (1957, 1959), Wittenborn (1957), Sheffield (1966a, 1966b), and Estes (1969b). It has usually been presumed by those who view drive as a state of either general or restricted potentiation that there are always stimuli on hand in any situation, ready to exploit the sensitized condition of the brain and hence to generate behavior. Which stimuli are "salient" and, therefore, what behavior is to be displayed have typically been matters of ex post facto judgment. Accordingly, such theories come down in the end to the simple assertion that the onset of a drive alters the stream of behavior in some way. With such a descriptive statement many others could easily agree (e.g., Atkinson &amp; Birch, 1970; Bindra, 1959; Carr, 1925; Estes, 1958; Hall, 1961; Hebb, 1949; Tolman, 1949, 1951, 1959; Wood worth, 1958; Woodworth &amp; Marquis, 1957). As was remarked earlier, the usual connotations of the term "drive" being what they are, it would be strange if the psychological concept associated with the term did not entail a sense of active participation in behavior. In fact it has evidently done so, from 1918 until the present time: "Drive" continues to denote 94</page><page sequence="25">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept a condition which prompts a response of some sort. To many psychologists it assertedly denotes a condition which produces behavioral arousal in particular. The present section has raised the question, however, as to whether that meaning is actually honored in usage. Conclusion The foregoing survey has shown plainly, I believe, that Hull's suggested amendments to the traditional concept of "drive" have been almost totally rejected by psychologists at large. His insistence on need as the substrate of drive, for example, has in effect been unanimously ignored. There has been a diminishing rather than a growing tendency to think of drives as peripheral stimuli. The doctrine of drive reduction as the essence of reinforcement is more clearly delineated now than it was in 1943, but probably less widely accepted. Finally, although there has been a substantial disposition to concur at the level of formal definition with Hull's ultimate concept of drive as a state of activation, it nevertheless remains common practice to recognize many drives which manifest themselves in states of retardation rather than states of activation. The weight that should be given to the formal definitions is therefore problematical; it seems likely that usage in this respect has not changed greatly since 1943. In addition to its negative findings with respect to Hull's impact upon the classical idea of "drive," the foregoing survey indicates, more positively, that the classical notion itself has endured. That notion, to belabor it, views "drive" as "a bodily state which renders the organism susceptible to reinforcement and which instigates behavior." Some Implications of the Concept of "Drive" While it may be a fact that criticisms of the supposedly traditional idea of "drive" have tended to miss their mark, it is equally a fact that, in the vagaries of its expression, that idea has constituted something of a moving target. Having been abstracted here rather carefully (not to say painfully), the concept should now be susceptible to more accurate evaluation; and such evaluation should in turn be facilitated by a recognition of the implications of its formal definition. In what follows, an attempt is made to state those implications. The definition of "drive" confronts us at the outset, then, with what is after all an extremely broad category?that of "bodily state." Especially within the context of "drive," however, we tend to give to "bodily state" a narrow and specialized interpretation. Thus, the term calls to mind tissue damage, stomach contractions, hormonal imbalance, and the like; or it may suggest such phenomena as autonomie arousal, muscular tension, or events in the reticular activating system. But such restriction is really quite arbitrary. "Bodily state" can also refer legitimately, as Seward and Seward (1937), Kendler (1965), and Hebb (1955) have all suggested, to a condition of the associative tissue of the brain.4 In short, "bodily state" is actually broad enough to allow "drive" to accommodate 4Indeed, Hebb (1955) called attention emphatically to the psychological importance of "the immediate drive value of cognitive processes, without intermediary." (p. 252). 95</page><page sequence="26">Kendon Smith both primary and secondary drives, no matter how basic or how derived they may be thought to be. "Bodily state," though, obviously embraces many conditions which are not drives, also. The definition's second stipulation?namely, that the bodily state shall be one of reinforcibility?accordingly seems to bear some promise of nar rowing the concept in a helpful fashion. Under careful consideration, however, that promise fades. For what is "a state of reinforcibility"? Unfortunately, it is virtually any state whatsoever. As has been argued elsewhere (Smith, 1974), an organism exists at any moment at some point on a continuum of susceptibility to reinforcement or attenuation. Translation in one direction along that continuum is rewarding; translation in the other is punishing. In principle, the continuum may have an absolute maximum. Practically speaking, however, the likelihood that the organism will approach that maximum is negligible. A transition from the animal's momentary condition, upward along the continuum, is therefore virtual ly never impossible. The organism is always to some degree reinforcible. What we usually do in this unhandy situation is, I think, what we usually do in many other basically similar situations. Thus, we commonly speak of individuals as being "intelligent," "energetic," "aggressive," or "reflective," in the face of the realization that every individual displays each of those traits to some degree. Our tacit understanding is that the persons (or animals) in question display them to notable degrees. In the same way, a "reinforcible" organism is one which is distinctly so. The fact that reinforcibility is a matter of degree, rather than an all-or-none phenomenon, may add a certain complexity to the notion of "drive." At the same time, however, it appears to be that very fact which enables us to speak at all quantitatively in this realm; for the degree of reinforcibility entailed by a drive is evidently precisely what constitutes our measure of the intensity of the drive itself. Thus, when we describe an organism as having "strong hunger drive," we are asserting that the organism's place on the continuum of reinforcement and attenuation, at least insofar as reinforcement by ingestion is concerned, is well toward the lower end. A transition from that state to almost any other higher one would be strongly reinforcing. Exact quantification of strength of drive must obviously depend upon close calibration of the continuum in question, and the problems and possibilities of such calibration were considered in the earlier paper (Smith, 1974). In opposition to the present assertion that intensity of drive is appraised in terms of degree of reinforcibility, there stands an almost conventional disposition to equate strength of drive simply with gross level of arousal. As has now been indicated repeatedly, but should perhaps be reiterated here for final emphasis, such an equation is totally unacceptable. It would be easy to recite a multitude of instances in each of which there is a drive for quiescence. Several have been men tioned already. There are even well-known conditions in which strong drives seem to be coupled with a striking lack of reactivity of any sort?one being that of 96</page><page sequence="27">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept retarded depression. It is clear that the "level of activation" approach to the calibration of drive is insupportable. Within the frame of reference of drive as a state of reinforcibility, there does remain the perennial question of whether or not reinforcement, when it does occur, depends necessarily upon the reduction of the strength of a drive. It is a consequence of the present discussion that, for better or worse, that question is answered out of hand, simply as a matter of definition. If strength of drive is con ceptualized as the degree to which an organism's bodily state places it toward the negative end of the continuum of reinforcement; and if reinforcement is achieved by the organism's moving up that scale in a positive direction; then what is rein forcing is necessarily a diminution in strength of drive. I believe it can be said in defense of this obligatory conclusion that it is not at all counter-intuitive. Without any reference to the present logic and simply within a framework of common sense, it is extremely difficult to see how an organism in which drive led to activity which further enhanced the drive?which circumstance led in turn to other activ ity which further enhanced the drive, and so on?could possibly survive. Such an organism would fall victim, in short order, to a positive-feedback runaway. I would suggest that the impression occasionally gained, that the enhancement of drive is reinforcing, arises from the uncritical assumption that increased activa tion is a reliable index of increased drive. As has now been stressed, it is not. An organism in a highly driven condition may remain comparatively inactive until a drive-reducing, and consequently reinforcing, response is emitted. Thereupon the animal begins vigorously to repeat the successful response. Energetic behavior is now being reinforced and thus repeated. Drive itself, nevertheless, is being reduced. Inasmuch as the classical concept of "drive" does in fact entail, if only tacitly, the principle of reinforcement by drive reduction, any criticism of the concept on the ground that it does so has been realistically, if fortuitously, directed. That such criticism happens to be properly aimed does not necessarily mean, however, that it is lethal. The force of the argument advanced above is entirely to the contrary. The third and final stipulation of the term "drive" concerns the instigation of behavior. Once more we remind ourselves that instigation may involve merely a change in the "direction" of behavior, with no systematic change whatsoever in level of activation. The nucleus of "instigation" seems to be the idea that some agency, in this case the drive state, affects responses simply "in some way or another"; the animal's behavior is different from what it would have been in the absence of the drive. But to characterize the drive state as one which instigates behavior has, accord ing to a view expressed several years ago (Smith, 1969), a major implication. The position taken in 1969 was that anything we call "behavior" is presumed, knowingly or not, to have been instigated by a conscious event of some sort (see esp. pp. 121-139). That is to say, the property of having been prompted by a sub jective event is part and parcel of what psychologists regard as "behavior" or 97</page><page sequence="28">Kendon Smith "response." It was emphasized that the conscious event in question might well be as rudimentary as mere sensation, although the possibility of a more cognitive experience instigating a response was not neglected. In any case, what the argu ment implies in the present context is that the drive state involves a conscious ex perience of some sort, which then produces a change in the stream of behavior.5 Although such an interpretation of "drive" may perhaps seem aberrant, to examine the history of the theory of drive is to find much that is consistent with it. In the classical "local" theory of drive, for example, the state of drive is in fact precisely a stimulus condition, and thus a source of afferent neural activity and of sensation. The "central" theory, which historically has tended to supercede the local view (cf. Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964, pp. 175-258; Morgan, 1943, pp. 417-465; 1957, 1959), has appeared in several guises. In one prominent version, however, drive has been seen as a condition in some part of the brain (usually the hypothalamus) which somehow sends "messages" to the cortex; the "messages" then prompt appropriate seeking behavior (e.g., Hilgard, Atkinson, &amp; Atkinson, 1979, pp. 288, 299, 321). In another variant of the same theory, drive promotes a central "set to perceive and react in certain ways which defines the goal. The hungry animal . . . 'wants' to eat, and its motivation is really as simple as that" (Morgan, 1943, pp. 461-462; in 1957 and 1959, incidentally, Morgan was inclined to give considerably more importance to stimulational factors). Dollard and Miller's position of 1950 was that drive was either an actual stimulus or a central phenomenon having equivalent "functional properties" (fn., pp. 30-31). Finally, it is an almost universal practice to regard such "subjective" events as emotions and feelings as drives; and the doctrine of learned drives is commonly formulated in such a way that cognitive experiences (such as, for example, the perception of one's bank balance as being perilously low) act as drives. All in all, then, the construction which has now been placed upon "instiga tion" seems to be not completely unreasonable. For psychology to involve con scious experience covertly in its definition of "drive" is in fact quite consistent with a propensity which appears to run through the entire discipline (Smith, 1969, pp. 121-139). In light of the foregoing considerations, the classical notion of "drive" may be given reasonably operational expression. An organic state which instigates behavior is a drive to the degree to which it renders the organism reinforcible. The total significance of this formulation rests heavily upon the term "organic state," which refers not only to visceral and somatic conditions as usually conceived, but to states of the brain as well. Having reached a definition of "drive" and having explicated it to some degree, it is possible now to turn to the question of "incentive motivation." Incentive Motivation A number of factors have been responsible for the declining importance of 5"Conscious experience" was analyzed and defined, it might be said, in explicit detail (Smith, 1969, pp. 93-120). 98</page><page sequence="29">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept "drive" and the complementary ascendance of "incentive motivation." Promi nent among them has been the common misconception that, if an activity does not express a biological need, it cannot possibly be a manifestation of drive and must therefore be a reflection of incentive motivation or something like it (e.g., Appley, 1970, p. 488; Beach, 1956; Bindra, 1959, pp. 9ff; Bolles, 1967, p. 367; 1975, pp. 281, 295ff.; Cofer, 1972, pp. 30ff; Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964, pp. 814-825; Harlow, 1953a, 1953b, 1953c; Schwartz, 1978, p. 113). As has now been shown, however, the notion of "drive" has actually had little historical connection with that of "need." Drives are not by definition rooted in biological requirements; conse quently, the existence of non-homeostatic drives is entirely possible. For some reason, too, the mere datum that behavior changes its character as the conditions of its reinforcement are changed has led some to adopt the ter minology of incentive motivation (e.g., Black, 1976; Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964, pp. 551ff.; Logan, 1960, 1968). It seems clear, as Cofer and Appley have suggested (1964, p. 553), that matters in this area could be handled readily enough in a straightforward, functional fashion. They were in fact so handled by Logan in 1960 and by Bolles in 1967 (pp. 331-367). Finally, it is notable that very little care has been taken, in the psychological literature, to differentiate between the alleged activating effects of incentives and their obvious directional effects (cf. Appley, 1970, pp. 493, 495-4986; Brown, 1953; 1961, pp. 97ff.; Miller, 1959, pp. 254-256). As was pointed out earlier, an organism already existing in a state of drive may not display that state overtly until there arise circumstances like those in which the organism has previously been reinforced for overt activity. Only then may vigorous, observable behavior appear. Thus, a drug addict who has been standing immobile on a street corner may, when her "connection" comes into sight, break for the first time into urgent activity. It is possible that her activity is prompted by some kind of representation, encoded within her, of reinforcements supplied by the dealer in the past; if it is, her reaction might be said to represent incentive motivation. But it is also possible that her activity is instead a directed learned response, involving no anticipation at all; in that event, it seems to me, we should not count it as incentive motivation. As the case of the imaginary drug addict may suggest, it is not always easy to distinguish between what is and what is not "incentive motivation." In fact, one familiar especially with the more recent literature might well reject either of the hypothetical accounts just offered as a valid instance of incentive motivation, upon the basis that incentive motivation, by definition, creates its own drive rather than depending upon a drive already in existence. Traditionally, however, it has been presumed that incentive motivation does depend upon the existence of an already active drive. Thus, we find Tolman observing in an early statement that the chance sight of delicious food or a beautiful woman seems on occasion of itself to arouse hunger or sex-appetite, in cases where the metabolic rhythms have not initiated any overt activity. But even in such instances a truer understanding of the case would suggest that the hunger and sex 6Appley's review of 1970, incidentally, embodies an excellent coverage of the incentive motiva tion literature available at the time. 99</page><page sequence="30">Kendon Smith conditions were already somewhat aroused and that the presence of the actual consummatory (or goal) object merely hastened the process. (Tolman, 1925-1925, p. 350) The attitude so expressed endured throughout Tolman's life (cf. Tolman, 1932, pp. 271ff.; 1959, pp. 101-130). Indeed, his summing-up of 1959 stressed the point that animals respond only when energized. Only when hungry or fearful or sex ually aroused or curious ... or whatever. (1959, p. 130) For Tolman, then, incentives did not so much produce motivation as bring to expression already existing drives (or "demands" or "needs," depending upon his momentary preference in nomenclature). Hull arrived at a basically similar posi tion. By themselves, he proposed, incentives are unavailing; they gain effect only insofar as they are potentiated by drive (e.g., 1952, p. 7). The systematic views of both Tolman and Hull are well known. It will therefore be recognized that Tolman was assuming, as he spoke, that the "sight of delicious food or a beautiful woman" would arouse related "expectancies"; and that Hull was envisioning a physical representation of the incentive within behavior itself. What the two approaches had in common, and what seems basically to characterize the idea of "incentive motivation," is this: that the organism's contemporary behavior is seen as being dependent upon a learned, internal representation of some past reinforcemental or attenuational experience.1 This assertion is a bald one, and it undoubtedly requires further support. Such support is expected to emerge, however, from the following consideration of a variety of notions as to what constitutes incentive motivation, even though its development is not the primary aim of that discussion. What I wish to do now is to go beyond Tolman and Hull and to project a spec trum of views in the matter of incentive motivation. And indeed it is a spectrum; notion shades into notion almost imperceptibly. The ends of the continuum are nonetheless reasonably distinctive, and it is therefore possible to divide the entire sequence, at least approximately, into (1) a cluster of "cognitive" viewpoints, and (2) a cluster of "behavioristic" ones, a procedure frequently followed. Members of the former group tend to stem historically from the ideas of Tolman; members of the latter are often traceable to Hull, although they reflect other influences also. Each group will now be considered separately. The essential aim of the discussion will be to show that "incentive motivation" is in either case logically subsumable under the construct of "acquired drive."8 The Tolmanian Tradition Tolman's own position on the issue of incentive motivation is well known, having been set forth in detail in his book of 1932 and in his summing-up of 1959. As specific utterances by other writers who have expressed related viewpoints, it 7A propensity for nativism, found in Tolman and in some of Hull's successors, is neglected here but will be considered later. 8It should be pointed out that the possibility of such a relationship has not been entirely neglected in the past (e.g., Appley, 1970, p. 492; Bolles, 1967, pp. 439-440; 1975, pp. 304ff; Brown, 1961, pp. 327-339; Brown &amp; F?rber, 1968). 100</page><page sequence="31">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept seems fair to list the following books and papers: Young 1936, 1955, 1961, and 1967; McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, and Lowell 1953 and 1976; Logan 1960 (cf. p. 3), 1968, 1977, and 1979; Stein 1964; Estes 1969a; Bolles 1972 and 1975; Bindra 1974 and 1976; Lajoie and Bindra 1976; and Black 1976. It is true that in some of these sources the cognitive, Tolmanian hue is minimal. Indeed, several of the individuals mentioned will be encountered again in a later list of "Hullian" references, their attitudes having shifted one way or the other with the passage of time. The foregoing citations seem, nevertheless, to embody an essentially com mon orientation. That orientation may be epitomized more or less as follows. An animal which repeatedly secures a certain commodity by making a certain response in a certain situation comes to "expect" that that response in that situa tion will produce that commodity. When circumstances arise which give value to the commodity in question (and such circumstances may be chronic as well as occasional), the expectation "naturally" prompts the animal to make an appropriate response. It is of course understood, as Tolman insisted to the end (1959, p. 100), that a "response" is not a particular pattern of muscular activity; it is rather, a performance, an achievement of some re-arrangement of objects in the world. An expectancy is thus seen as functioning to give to the animal's behavior the characteristic so often called "direction." With respect to the substance of cognitive theory there is much that can be, and has been, criticized. The standard objection involves the total lack of explana tion as to how an expectancy, no matter how envisaged, is able to produce motor behavior (although Bolles, in 1972, defended the expectancy theorist's right to rebut that objection by postulational fiat). The question at hand, however, does not concern the substantive validity of cognitive theories. Rather, has to do with whether or not such theories are embraced conceptually by the notion of "acquired drive." Plainly, the answer to that question is "Yes." What is being asserted by expec tancy theory is that the learned perception of an environmental circumstance leads, by virtue of past experience, to a bodily state of expectation; and that the latter state then both (1) prompts behavior, and (2) renders the animal reinforcible by any change in its condition from one which less nearly approximates some specific "goal" condition to one which more nearly does so. Thus, for example, a male animal's perception of an environmental object as a conspecific female might lead to the male's expectancy of copulation; and that expectancy in turn would confer a learned reinforcemental value upon any act?approach, "court ship," mounting?which had in the past made copulation more imminent. If the male's perception should change, and the object should come to be seen as a predator, the new expectancy would be that of possible injury; and, abruptly, any behavior which diminished the likelihood of injury would become reinforcing. It is important that the act of expectation is not envisaged simply as stimulus to a forced or mechanical response. It is seen, emphatically, as giving "value" to an object and "direction" to behavior; as, in short, making some general class of alteration in circumstances reinforcing. The expectancy response thus fulfills the definition of "drive." More precisely, it constitutes an acquired drive. 101</page><page sequence="32">Kendon Smith It is of some interest that, even if the expectancy response as such does not occur?even if the anticipation is "tacit," "unconscious," or admittedly absent?an acquired drive is still entailed by the cognitive account. The first order, perceptual response is itself a learned bodily state; and it may prompt behavior and confer reinforcibility. If one is strolling across a street and, looking up, sees a truck bearing down, it is questionable whether one projects explicitly the likelihood of mutilation and death. The mere perception of the truck may simply become a very strong drive to get back to the curb as quickly and in whatever fashion possible. In sum, then, it seems quite evident that the cognitive, expectancy, "Tolman ian" variety of incentive motivation reduces to acquired drive; and that it does so even if the step of literal, explicit expectancy is omitted. In either version, a learned cognitive state serves both to evoke behavior and to make the organism reinforcible by any increase in the degree of approximation to some particular relationship with the environment; and it does so by virtue of past experience. We may thus turn to the Hullian variety of incentive motivation, and to the possibility that it, as well as the Tolmanian, can be accommodated by the notion of "drive." The Hullian Tradition What distinguishes the behavioral tradition in general is its opposition to anything resembling the mentalism imputed to Tolman and to those who have followed him. Accordingly, behavioral theories of incentive motivation have characteristically been expressed in terms of hypothetical neural or neuromuscular events?events which are now recognized, it should be noted, as being comparable in their obscurity to the subjective expectancies of the Tolmanian tradition. As being representative of the behavioral approach to incentive motivation theory, the following publications might be adduced: Beach 1942, 1956, and 1970; Morgan 1943, 1957, and 1959; Hull 1943, 1951, and 1952: Spence 1951 and 1956; Campbell and Sheffield 1953; Sheffield and Campbell 1954; Sheffield, Roby, and Campbell 1954; Mowrer 1956 and 1960; Estes 1958, 1969b, and 1970; Bindra 1959 and 1968; Cofer and Appley 1964; Sheffield 1965, 1966a, and 1966b; Bolles 1967; Atkinson and Birch 1970; and Cofer 1972. As has been mentioned, some names which appeared on the earlier, "Tolmanian" list also appear here. Views have changed over time. It is perhaps stretching the category of "Hullian" to label this entire school of thought as being such. Even when one of the sources listed does not admittedly depend upon Hull's system, however, it is still likely to show the effects of his earlier, pre-1943 thought if not his later ideas. In particular, there is apt to be reference to something resembling the mechanisms of "K" and &lt;&lt;rg-sg" (cf. Hull 1943, 1951, 1952; Spence, 1951, 1956), mechanisms which have been so highly publicized as to require no explanation here. They have now suffered serious and probably fatal criticism (cf. Logan 1968; Appley, 1970); but, even as they have done so, they have tended to metamorphose into a wealth of new forms. It is not feasible to consider each of the latter separately here; but it is possible to scrutinize 102</page><page sequence="33">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept the most explicit and thoroughgoing contribution to the class, F.D. Sheffield's "drive induction" theory of motivation (Sheffield, 1966a). Sheffield's ideas not only have grown out of the more traditional ones, but they are clearly discernable in the theoretical constructs of several who have followed him. It seems justifiable, accordingly, to regard Sheffield's views as prototypical of the broadly Hullian mode of thought and to evaluate them as such. That procedure is carried out in the paragraphs which now follow. As is well enough known, Sheffield has long maintained that the ultimate rein forcer is neither need-satisfaction nor the achievement of a particular state of stimulation. It is instead the performance of a "consummatory response." The latter term, a venerable one (cf. Sherrington, 1906, p. 329) which is currently experiencing something of a renaissance, is often defined rather casually as "eating, drinking, copulating, and so on." Sheffield attempted to be more precise: As ordinarily used in psychology, "consummatory response" refers to the response that consummates the drive or motive?that is, the response that removes the drive. Usually a single response does not do this and we use "consummatory response" to label the kind of behavior that will consum mate the drive if the behavior is continued long enough?as eating when hungry. Consummatory behavior is circularly maintained?the response produced stimuli elicit the response until the drive state is changed. ... In the present formulation the important thing about consummatory behavior is that it brings striving to an end; it removes the internal or external stimuli for excitement and brings about the stimulation that the animal "does nothing to avoid, often doing such as to maintain" in Thorndike's (1911) definition of a reward. (1966a, p. 99)9 It was Sheffield's presumption (1966b, p. 113), and it remains a common one, that consummatory responses are innate. That presumption will not be challenged here, but its vulnerability is worthy of note. In any event, the consummatory response is viewed by Sheffield as an uncon ditioned reaction to contact with a consummatory commodity; and it is crucial that, for him, learning proceeds by Pavlovian principles alone. His system envisages a deprived organism's being in the vicinity of a consummatory com modity on several occasions. Whenever, upon one of these occasions, an ap propriate response is made, it is followed shortly by the onset of the consum matory response itself. After a number of successful "trials," the usual pro prioceptive and exteroceptive precursors of the consummatory response tend to arouse the consummatory response itself. The latter, however, cannot quite yet be made. The animal, thus frustrated, experiences "excitement" or "excited emo tion"?meaning, says Sheffield (1966a, p. 100), "nothing more complicated than 9In spite of an expressed distaste for the term "drive" (1966b, p. 113), Sheffied did employ it, as this passage indicates. He employed it, moreover, in reference to two different phenomena: (1) states of physiological deficit, and (2) states of activation or excitement. One is obliged to look to context for guidance. 103</page><page sequence="34">Kendon Smith the autonomic-skeletal state of the organism present when we describe the in dividual as excited." By virtue of principles not stipulated, this autonomic skeletal state is then "channeled" in such a way that it "necessarily feeds back in to performance" (1966a, p. 102). The responses ordinarily leading to consumma tion are thus supposed to be given preferential facilitation. The concept of progressively higher levels of conditioning fits nicely into such a framework, and Sheffield takes full advantage of that fact. The upshot is that arousal of the incomplete consummatory response will work its way from the goal backward over the instrumental sequence since only the cues in this sequence invariably precede reward. Thus performing the correct responses?and only the correct ones?becomes a cue-producing situation that arouses the incomplete consummatory response. (Sheffield et al., 1954, p. 354, cf. also Sheffield, 1966b, p. 112) The most general statement of the overall mechanism is that the animal is forced to follow courses of action that maximize conditioned arousal of the consummatory response. (Sheffield, 1966a, p. 102) It would seem to be a consequence of Sheffield's system as thus described that the organism's progress toward the usual site of reinforcement would proceed by a series of discrete, impulsive charges: that the animal would respond more or less randomly at point A until the "correct" incipient response happened to occur, whereupon it would find itself propelled to point B, where the process would repeat itself?and so on. Sheffield, however, sees a more comprehensive sort of conditioning at work. In particular, "the consummatory response will also be conditioned to various general and specific cues in the situation other than those strictly emanating from the instrumental response. . . . Such subsidiary condi tioning has the effect of making the animal more active and exploratory in the right places" (1966a, p. 102). Furthermore, the occurrence of ordinary motor learning by virtue of continguity and frequency are apparently taken for granted (e.g., 1966a, p. 103; 1966b, p. 112). What is clearly evident from the foregoing account, and what in fact Sheffield freely admits (1966a, pp. 98, 99, 103), is that all of this adds up to the empirical law of effect. Within that framework, moreover, the theory is seen as one of acquired drive. Thus: At the molar level of the law of effect the animal learns the responses that arouse the conditioned consummatory response; these, like all rewards that strengthen responses, are secondary rewards. (1966a, p. 103) and: My own position is that all reinforcement in the law-of-effect sense is based on acquired motivation?the strengthening of the instrumental act is a direct effect of the incentive value of the reward at a distance. (1966a, p. 104) It is tempting to accept at face value Sheffield's flat equation of incentive motivation with acquired drive and to welcome it as collateral support for the argument being advanced here. Unhappily, the situation is not that simple. As will 104</page><page sequence="35">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept be recalled, Sheffield treats the term "drive" only with disclaimer and indif ference; but, if his is indeed a theory of "drive induction," then his principal referent for "drive" must be the hypothetical state of excitement arousal by the sign of an imminent consummatory event. It would be rather difficult to construe such excitement as drive in the consensual sense of the term. A case might even be made?although it is not easy to tell?for the view that the Sheffeldians have equated "drive" with sheer "activation." At the least, however, we cannot simply accept Sheffield's assurance that he is talking about acquired drives. We need to look into the matter independently and in terms of the conventional semantic. In part, the issue may be handled without difficulty. Thus, the condition por trayed by Sheffield as fundamental?namely, the organism's perception either of the consummatory object itself or of some signal of its availability?is certainly a bodily state; and there is little doubt that Sheffield would view it as one due to learning. It is, furthermore, clear enough that that bodily state prompts behavior; it produces the "excitement" which energizes ongoing behavior. That much hav ing been said with confidence, there nevertheless remains a real and final question: Can the same bodily state be said, in a legitimate sense, also to create a condition of reinforcibility in the animal? Considering Sheffield's unqualified acceptance of the "molar" law of effect, we might almost assume as a matter of definition that the answer to the question must be "Yes." Surely the law of effect implies secondary reinforcement; and secondary reinforcement implies secondary, acquired drive. To look closely at Sheffield's system is in fact to find support for this assumption. Recall again that the ongoing behavior in which the excited state manifests itself is flexible and adaptive. The animal is not propelled toward the incentive in rigid, mechanical, forced movements. What the critical perception does is to energize something best called a "tendency to approach" the incentive. Put differently, it could be said to give "direction" to the animal's behavior. But "direction," as we have seen, implies reinforcibility: Responses which move the animal toward the incentive are continued or repeated; those that do not are abandoned. Progress toward con summation is therefore, operationally speaking, as much a learned reinforcer for Sheffield as it is for Tolman; and the state produced by the imminence of the incentive is in that sense one of reinforcibility. It will be recalled that Sheffield's views are chosen at the outset as a particular ly well-drafted instance of a more general category, that composed of theories especially clearly related to the Hull-Spence "rg-sg" schema (e.g., Atkinson &amp; Birch, 1970; Campbell &amp; Sheffield, 1953; Sheffield &amp; Campbell, 1954; Sheffield et al., 1954; Estes, 1958, 1969b, 1970; Hull, 1951, 1952; Mowrer, 1956, 1960; Shef field, 1965, 1966a, 1966b; Spence, 1951, 1956). I now wish to suggest that the same kind of logic which has been applied above to Sheffield's system could, with minor changes, be applied to other members of the category; and that the essential conclusion would in each case survive. Generically speaking, each of those systems is making its own speculative attempt to account for the operational law of effect in terms of the Pavlovian conditioning of greatly modified "consum 105</page><page sequence="36">Kendon Smith matory responses." But the law of effect is not really disputed, and the upshot is that "incentive motivation," empirically speaking, becomes synonymous with "acquired drive." It is almost as if the behaviorists were providing their own arbitrary rationalization, just as the cognitivists have provided theirs, for the observable fact of "direction"?reinforcibility?in animal conduct. Now, some reservation has already been expressed about the notion of "con summatory response," even though the notion be portrayed as conservatively as it has been by the systems so-far considered. Consummatory responses, even strictly conceived, vary greatly as to topography, in a fashion more suggestive of adaptive learning than of maturational necessity; moreover, they represent precisely the kind of behavior which would necessarily be learned, given a normal organism in a normal environment, if the animal's primary drives were to be met: swallowing water, for example, is virtually the only way in which an everyday animal can possibly hydrate itself. Consummatory responses could thus be expected to be learned early in the life of an organism, and maintained enduringly. All in all, the attempt to make of them a few innate, "hard-wired" units of behavior seems at least questionable. In spite of such signposts to caution, there has grown up another general category of behavioral theory of incentive motivation?whose origins are as much zoological-physiological as Hullian?which appeals even more lavishly to the con summatory response than does the first. It can perhaps be characterized by a brief review of prototypical publications. An appropriate item with which to begin is the seminal paper of 1942 by F.A. Beach, a paper whose position Beach elaborated in 1956 and 1970. Scornful of nebulous notions like "motivation" and "drive," Beach (1970, pp. 28-31) pro posed a theory of "sexual appetite." Hormonal changes sensitize the animal in such a way that the advent of appropriate exteroceptive stimulation triggers "the copulatory response"; by an associative principle, new stimuli (or images) may acquire a similar releasing property. The learning process involved is described informally, but the consummatory, copulatory response is evidently regarded as global and situationally adaptive in itself. An expanded but closely similar doc trine was proposed at about the same time by Morgan (1943), it being buttressed, also, by later papers (Morgan, 1957, 1959). Morgan came close to making all motivated behavior, at least in lower animals, little more than a collection of elaborate consummatory responses; a "central motive state," due, generally speaking, to both metabolic and sensory influences, "predisposes the organism to react in certain ways . . . [I]t sets or primes the organism to react by approaching certain odors, tastes, and textures" (1959, p. 648). A reduction in the central motive state was conceded to have some reinforcemental value, but emphasis was laid upon ready-made, goal-directed responses to complex perceptual situations (Morgan, 1959). In the 1950's, Harlow's advocacy of "external drives" (1953a, 1953b, 1953c) generalized completely the theme pursued by Beach and Morgan, although the kinship between Harlow's views and those of Beach and Morgan has not been commonly recognized. In spite of a perhaps misleading preference for the ter 106</page><page sequence="37">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept minology of "drive," Harlow did make a brief but unequivocal statement in favor of "temperospatial contiguity ... a principle stressed by Pavlov and Guthrie" (1953b, p. 46); and again there was implicit but heavy dependence upon elaborate consummatory responses. Bindra (1959, 1968) propounded a system which seemed at bottom to resemble Morgan's. And, finally, influential texts by Cofer and Appley (1964) and by Cofer (1972) tended strongly to institutionalize the general notion of "motivated," "goal directed" activity as being an expression of the classical conditioning of elaborate, maturational, consummatory responses. When a consummatory response is viewed as maturational, adaptive, and linked behaviorally to perceived environmental situations, it plainly becomes an instinctive response; and the positions catalogued above have thus been founded, consciously or not, on a doctrine of instinctualism. At the same time they all appear to allow, not only for the classical conditioning of the instinctive response itself, but for a certain degree of instrumental shaping of that response as well. What is being portrayed, then, is an organism which is emitting (1) unalloyed instinctive behavior, (2) instinctive behavior which has come to be prompted by learned cues, or (3) behavior which represents the impingement of learning upon both the form and the adequate stimulus of an innate response system. The first of these possibilities clearly is not a case of acquired drive; it is entire ly nativistic, and its further discussion will be relegated to a brief sub-section soon to follow. The remaining two cases, just as clearly, exemplify acquired drive. The literature which urges them upon us even has a certain Tolmanian quality. An essentially cognitive portrayal of new objects in the environment busily taking on positive or negative value through learning shows rather plainly beneath the osten sible physiology. Arguments have now been advanced to the effect that the greater part of what is called "incentive motivation" is not different from what has long been called "acquired drive." Some exceptions, especially the case of allegedly unlearned incentive motivation, nevertheless remain to be dealt with. The following sub section attempts to handle that particular problem; it also considers briefly what might be called just the inverse problem, that of the possibility that no incentives (or drives) are innate. Final considerations At least some members of both the cognitive camp (e.g., Bolles, 1972, 1975, p. 320; Tolman, 1932, p. 271) and the behavioral (e.g., Beach, 1942, 1951, 1956; Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964; Harlow, 1953a, 1953b, 1953c; Morgan, 1943, 1957, 1959) have postulated some measure of innate incentive motivation. The totally inex perienced organism is supposed, that is, to perceive an environmental state of affairs and immediately either (cognitively) "place a positive or negative value upon it" or (behaviorally) "be prompted to approach or avoid it." As has already been suggested, either perspective is that of instinctualism in its most controversial form, and it could be argued that both deserve to be dismissed out of hand. Once more, however, a substantive judgment is inappropriate and a conceptual decision is what is called for. 107</page><page sequence="38">Kendon Smith Fortunately, the latter is not difficult to reach. From a conceptual point of view, the notion of "unlearned incentive motivation" is tantamount to the asser tion that organisms mature in such a way that drives may be aroused in them by the perception of environmental circumstances. The animal behaves precisely as if a learned drive were being evoked, except that there has been no relevant history of past learning. It displays what Harlow called "external drives," to contrast them with such "internal drives" as hunger and thirst (Harlow, 1953a, 1953b). The hypothetical "unlearned incentive motivation" thus reduces to unlearned drive. Manifestly it cannot be an instance of learned drive, for nothing is learned. In more or less direct opposition to the doctrine of innate incentive motivation (or drive) there stands a second view?namely, that no innate, primary drives, in the usual sense of the term, exist; indeed, in some versions, that even no innately effective incentives exist. A number of variations of this general theme have been composed (e.g., Atkinson &amp; Birch, 1970, pp. 139-170; Beach, 1942, 1956; Bindra, 1968, 1974, 1976, pp. 179-183; Bolles, 1967, pp. 434-451; Campbell &amp; Sheffield, 1953; Cofer, 1972, pp. 149-153; Cofer &amp; Appley, 1964, pp. 814-825; Estes, 1958, 1969a, 1969b, 1970; Lajoie &amp; Bindra, 1976; McClelland et al., 1953, 1976; Shef field, 1966a, 1966b; Sheffield &amp; Campbell, 1954; Young, 1966, 1967). It would appear that those who deny primary drives are taking a position which is almost indefensible in terms of evolutionary principles. Inasmuch as the inexperienced organism is seen as being totally unperturbed by even grave depriva tion, it would seem that, in the limit, the animal would die of hunger or thirst?absent the sheer good luck of happening upon food or water. The more extreme version, which requires that the animal not only discover the consum matory object but also achieve consummation, makes for even greater implausibility. Whatever veridicality may reside in this sort of doctrine, the fact remains that it does not negate the conceptual value of "drive." It still portrays an organism which is, at the very least, reinforcible. And once adequate reinforcement has occurred, the organism is stirred to action on later occasions by the sight, sound, or smell of the incentive and becomes reinforcible by some class of change in rela tionship to it. Thus, there now exists a bodily state which prompts behavior and which renders the animal reinforcible in a new way?in short, there now exists an acquired drive. Incentive Motivation: Summary The present section has accepted the conventional distinction between the "cognitive" and the "behavioral" versions of what is called "incentive motiva tion" and has examined each of those variants at some length. Considerable detail has been involved, but the overall logic of the discussion may be summarized as follows: What might be called the prototypical incentive motivation theory limns an organism as experiencing a transition from circumstance A to cir cumstance B (e.g., non-copulation to copulation) and as being thereby changed in such a way that any subsequent encounter with a cue that that 108</page><page sequence="39">"Drive": In Defense of a Concept transition is again possible activates a generalized disposition to make a sort of response which has, in the past, accomplished the transition. There have been more or less cognitive, and more or less behavioral, attempts to explain this phenomenon. Whatever the explanation may be, however, the phenomenon itself is clearly what has long been called "acquired drive." A perceptual event prompts behavior, and that behavior shows the animal to be reinforcible, by virtue of past experience, through successive approx imations to accomplishment of the transition in question. The "prototypical incentive motivation theory" involves learning. There is a minority position in favor of unlearned incentive motivation. As has been indicated, such a position is essentially instinctivist. Instincts, whether or not they exist in fact, might well be defined as unlearned perceptual drives?drives to change one real-world state of affairs into another. Unlearned incentive motiva tion thus fits nearly under the rubric of "drive." Finally, there is another minority view, to the effect that all incentives, drives, or motives owe their existence to learning. Once again, the substantive point is moot; the concepts involved are nevertheless plainly compatible with that of "drive." General Summary and Conclusions The first section of the present essay urges the point that the traditional, "classical" concept of "drive" is that of a bodily state which prompts behavior and which renders the organism reinforcible. Put more rigorously: a bodily state which prompts behavior is a drive to the extent to which it makes the animal rein forcible; the bodily state in question may well be a state of the central nervous system, and the definition therefore embraces acquired drives as well as innate. It is suggested in the two succeeding sections that the classical concept has remained the consensual one, in spite of Hull's attempts to modify it. Following a brief attempt to clarify the implications of the classical concept, the final section of the paper argues that that notion covers quite adequately the conceptual ground which has been thought to require the additional notion of "incentive motivation" as a canopy. The latter construct thus appears to be logically redundant. More globally, the conclusion which emerges is that it is totally fallacious to say, as is so often done, that "drives push behavior, but incentives pull." Behavior is neither pushed nor pulled. It occurs because some organic condition, combined with some environmental circumstance, obliges it to occur. The organic condition is the drive state. The environmental circumstance may be called, if one wishes, the "incentive." Beyond that, it has no particular significance.10 10The present paper has been aimed specifically at conceptual issues rather than substantive. All the same, there arises from the foregoing discussion a suggestion as to the nature of acquired drives which seems to warrant brief consideration. The general notion of drives which have been learned has great intuitive appeal, but there is no denying that it has had a history of nebulosity and mentalism (cf. Brown, 1953, 1961; Brown &amp; 109</page><page sequence="40">Kendon Smith Farber, 1968). Brown (1953, 1961) and others (cf. Appley, 1970) have struggled to reconcile the no tion with a Hullian view of drive as an undifferentiated potentiator of associative connections. Their suggestions have been, I believe, more ingenious than compelling, inasmuch as they have depended upon several dubious assumptions concerning the nature of visceral conditioning, the visceral basis of emotion, and the relation between emotion and drive (cf. Mineka, 1979; Smith, 1954, 1958, 1967). The possibility growing out of the present discussion is a simple one. In essence, it would propose that an acquired drive is merely a generalized habit by another name. What is involved here is the theoretically troublesome but patently real phenomenon of response generalization. One of the most obvious facts of animal and human behavior is that the reinforce ment of a specific response in a specific situation strengthens not only that particular "S-R connec tion" but a whole gamut of connections which tend to produce, in many different ways, essentially the same reinforcing state of affairs. Hull recognized that fact by inventing the "habit-family hierar chy." Skinner achieved the same effect by defining the "op?rant" in such a way that it constituted a habit-family hierarchy from the start (cf. Catania, 1973). Examples of response generalization come easily to mind. An animal which has approached a food box from one particular distance and direction, and found food there, learns, holus-bolus, to approach the box on later occasions from whatever direction and angle is necessary. An animal which, when a signal light comes on, is shocked at a certain location in the black chamber of a shut tle box and takes a certain route to a particular location in the white chamber, has learned, more broadly, to move from the black to the white chamber when the light comes on. A child taught that ingratiation is the secret of success grows up doing whatever is necessary in any social situation to make the transition from a state of lesser to one of greater social favor. What is notable is that another, equally valid way of describing these same phenomena is to speak in terms of acquired drives. Thus, the animal of the first example, above, has been modified by experience in such a way that the sight of the food box now stirs it to behavior, and makes rein forcing any move which brings the box closer, attenuating any move which takes it farther away. For the second animal, the perception of the light has become a physiological state which prompts activ ity and which renders any movement away from the black chamber and toward the white chamber reinforcing. And the child is now, when it detects signs of social rejection, activated and made susceptible to reinforcement by signals of acceptance. In short, each organism has acquired a "learned drive"?or, perhaps more accurately, a "drive due to learning." There is obviously a striking correspondence between what is now being described in behavioral terms and what Tolman interpreted as the acquisition of new values; indeed, it was very probably behavior of the sort here identified which prompted Tolman's anthropomorphism in the first place. There is no denying that the facts of response generalization (or, alternatively, acquired drive) strongly suggest the possibility of mediation of overt behavior by cognitive behavior. It is never theless essential to remember that the prevalence and importance of cognitive mediation, even in human beings, is still far from being established; and that, at present, it is impossible to say anything definitive about the respective weights of cognitive and noncognitive factors in governing behavior.
