<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Studies Quarterly (2008) 52, 103-128 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE: Turning Base Metal into Gold? Andreas Bieler University of Nottingham Adam David Morton University of Nottingham This article engages with the debate on how the role of ideas can be conceptualized within International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE) and how this is related to the discursive pro? duction of meanings embedded in the economy. It is argued that although constructivist and poststructuralist approaches can conceptual? ize the structural relevance of ideas, thereby improving on neorealist and liberal institutionalist approaches, they nevertheless fail to explain why certain ideas dominate over others at a particular moment in time. In response to constructivist and poststructuralist criticism, it is argued that the internal relation of ideas as material social processes is appreci? ated better through an historical materialist theory of history. In other words, the article shows how ideas can be conceived as material social processes through which signs become part of the socially created world in a way that surpasses the deficits of constructivist and poststructuralist approaches alike, whilst avoiding the problems of economism. Following general developments within the social sciences, the conceptualization of the role of ideas in the disciplines of International Relations (IR) and Interna? tional Political Economy (IPE) has become increasingly important over recent years. Neorealism and liberal institutionalism generally treat ideas as exogenous to states' interest formation and state interaction. It has been gradually pointed out, however, that such approaches cannot answer important "questions of which economic theories and beliefs are most likely to shape the definition of interests in international relations and why and how it is that particular sets of ideas prevail in the international arena" (Woods 1995, 161; see also Jacobsen 2003, 41). A first set of attempts to deal with this problem resulted in an amend? ment to these approaches by simply adding an additional focus on ideas (e.g. Adler and Haas 1992; Haas 1992; Goldstein and Keohane 1993).

Such approaches are thus based on a positivist understanding of social science as are mainstream IR perspectives more widely. This involves a separation of subject and object and the search for clear cause-effect relation? ships. For example, some scholars have tried to establish relationships via the identification of institutional and/or actor-centered causal mechanisms. It is then argued that ideas acquire causal relevance when they become embedded as orga? nizational rules and procedures in institutions (Goldstein and Keohane 1993, 20-24; Yee 1996, 88-92). A problem befalling this literature, however, is that ideas are still treated as causes, as possible additional explanatory variables, leaving no space for under? standing ideas as partly constituting the wider social totality. Ideas are merely seen as commodities, as objects which influence other objects. This ''reinforces the notion that ideas' are distinct from interests and that their role, in practice, is limited to manipulation; and it obscures the constitutive function of 'ideas'" (Laffey and Weldes 1997, 207). In short, the emphasis on empirical analysis of observable behavior prevents mainstream IR approaches from capturing the struc? tural quality of ideas in the form of "intersubjective meanings" (Yee 1996, 102). Since these early debates, three sets of theoretical perspectives have more recently emerged, which challenge neorealist and liberal institutionalist approaches more fundamentally in the way they conceptualize the role of ideas: social constructivist, poststructuralist and historical materialist contributions. As postpositivist theories, they all commonly question the notion that it is possible to establish causal relationships within a given objective reality. Hence, they share a rather different concentration on the analysis of structural change. They all agree that ideas can be part of overall structural conditions in the form of intersubjective meanings, that is, collectively held beliefs. They differ, however, in their underlying normative rationale and how precisely intersubjectivity can be conceptualized because of their different ontologic/epistemologic approaches (Smith 1995, 24-26; Smith 1996, 35, 38). In this article, we set out to discuss crit? ically these approaches, aiming to establish the pivotal contributions of an histor? ical materialist conceptualization of the role of ideas embedded in material social practices that is relevant to IR theory. In the first main section we focus on social constructivism which has argued that ideas, in the form of intersubjective meanings, are as much part of the structure confronting agents as are material processes. Hence ideas may constrain or enable agency. Additionally, ideas may change as the result of individual and collective agency and the establishment of new intersubjective meanings. In short, there is a very close relationship between ideas, practice, and the overall structure within which agency operates. Importantly, however, agency often remains under-concep? tualized across social constructivist approaches. Moreover, while the latter can establish how specific ideas might become part of the overall structure, social con structivists are unable to explain why a particular set of ideas became part of the structure and not another, rival set of ideas at a particular moment in time. The subsequent section then analyzes poststructuralist contributions to the analysis of discourse in and beyond IR theory. Poststructuralism has generally criticized social constructivism for not questioning more directly the way structure and subjects are constituted. Simply adding an ideational dimension to structural conditions does not overcome the problem of separating structure and agency. Rather, the focus has to be on how the constitution of the social subject is directly linked to the dis? cursive founding of the social order. One implicates the other, and they cannot be analytically separated. As a result, poststructuralists concentrate on power/knowl? edge relations articulated through discourse around the moments when a new founding myth is created and a new social order (along with social subjects) is</page><page sequence="3">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 105 constituted. Similar to constructivist approaches, however, while it is outlined how a particular discourse can gain dominance at a specific point in time, the question as to why a certain discourse and not another is successful is not addressed. The underlying power structures promoting individual discourses are overlooked. It is by stressing the importance of such underlying power structures that the turning point toward historical materialism is made. At the same time, recent poststructuralist scholarship has accused critical, historical materialist approaches in IR/IPE for taking "the economic and financial domains as unproblematic or material starting points to their enquiries," thus failing "to enquire how finan? cial knowledge, including statistics and indices, has been historically developed" (de Goede 2003, 80). These critical historical materialist perspectives in IPE are therefore accused of economism in that class identity is presented as preceding the political and, thus, driving explanation in a determinist way. "The point to be emphasized here is that in Gramscian IPE, culture, discourse, and ideology remain largely in the domain of the superstructure, and of secondary impor? tance to the study of the economic base which ultimately determines the objec? tive economic interests of agents." In other words, there is supposedly an undue distinction "between the material sphere of the economic and the ideational sphere of the political" (de Goede 2003, 90; see also de Goede 2005, 7). Similarly, these claims are linked to recent moves asserting attentiveness to modes of knowledge, dominant discourses, and practices in delineating approaches to the financialization of the economy, perceptions of risk, and the governmentality of global civil society, whilst eschewing any link to developments in the logic of capitalism held to be plaguing critical IPE (Amoore 2004; Amoore and Langley 2004; Langley 2004a). These authors desire a move away from the set? tled, defined and delimited boundaries of political community whilst, in doing so, reprimanding an ill defined and shifting 'orthodox' IPE viewpoint. Indeed, the tendency to conflate 'orthodox' and critical IPE approaches across such commen? taries on the problematic of sovereignty is a common practice (Ashley 1996, 241-243; Campbell 1996, 9-10). Hence, before outlining a historical materialist contribution to the understanding of ideas, we first outline the philosophy of internal relations at the heart of a historical materialist, yet non-deterministic, approach. This allows us, then, in the final section, to show that for historical materialist critical IR/IPE, "it is not true that the philosophy of praxis 'detaches' the structure from the superstructures when, instead, it conceives their develop? ment as intimately bound together and necessarily interrelated and reciprocal" (Gramsci 1995, 414). It is the dialectical way ideas prevail in interrelationship with material properties that can be subsumed within an historical materialist theory of history, which is the core of our analysis. Thus, we will show how ideas can be con? ceived as material social processes through which signs become part of the socially created world in a way that surpasses the deficits of social constructivist and post structuralist approaches alike, without collapsing into the problem of economism. Social Constructivism: The Ideal/Material as Always-Already Separate and Combined Social constructivists consider ideas to be 'intersubjective meanings,' defined as "the product of the collective self-interpretations and self-definitions of human communities" (Neufeld 1995, 77). Together, these intersubjective meanings make up a 'web of meaning,' which is as much a part of the social totality, the struc? tures human beings are confronted with, as material social practices. It is argued, Interestingly, the same critical work in IPE has also been accused of too strong an emphasis on the role of ideas, collapsing into an empirical pluralism and, thereby, overlooking the central importance of the sphere of pro? duction (see Burnham 1991).</page><page sequence="4">106 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE consequently, that "the practices in which human beings are engaged cannot be studied in isolation from the 'web of meaning,' which is, in a fundamental sense, constitutive of those practices, even as it is embedded in and instantiated through those same practices" (Neufeld 1995, 76). This definition is widely accepted by social constructivists. For example, Emanuel Adler (1997, 322) argues that "con? structivism is the view that the manner in which the material world shapes and is shaped by human action and interaction depends on dynamic normative and epi stemic interpretations of the material world." The close link between ideas and practice is further highlighted, albeit from a different stance, by Mark Laffey and Jutta Weldes (1997, 209) who define ideas as "symbolic technologies," which "are, most simply, intersubjective systems of representations and representation producing practices." In other words, ideas are not objects to be fetishized but intersubjectively constituted forms of social action that shape social reality. Alexander Wendt develops this social constructivist line and criticizes state-cen? tric approaches such as neorealism for taking the interests and identity of states as given, that is, as exogenous to the process of state interaction. This makes the explanation of "identities and interests, the reproduction and/or transformation of which is a key determinant of structural change," impossible (Wendt 1994, 394). He further argues that structure, within which action takes place, does not only consist of material capabilities, but also of intersubjectively constituted identi? ties and interests in the states-system. He notes that "it is through reciprocal inter? action... that we create and instantiate the relatively enduring social structures in terms of which we define our identities and interests" (Wendt 1992, 406). Thus, structures are endogenous to process, and changing practices of interaction will change 'intersubjective meanings' that partly constitute social totality. Applied to the neorealists' understanding of the international system as logically anarchic, Wendt counters that this structure is also characterized by the intersubjective meanings collectively held by states. Anarchy may be one possibility, but the inter? national system could equally be characterized by rivalry, which considers both war and cooperation a possibility, or it could alternatively be characterized by a notion of collective security (Wendt 1999, 246-312). In short, "anarchy is what states make of it." While clearly an advance over neorealist IR theory, there are, however, several problems with Wendt's understanding. First, his constructivism does not allow him to conceptualize which actors are important for his analysis. Instead, he simply falls back on the neorealist understanding that states are the most impor? tant international actors (Wendt 1992, 424; Wendt 1999, 39, 43). Thus, Wendt's variant of social constructivism suffers from state-centricity and an empiricist meth? odology (Bieler and Morton 2001, 11-12; Campbell 1996, 12; Wight 2004, 273 279). Secondly, Wendt also continues to take "the view that material conditions are in fact independent of ideas" (Palan 2000, 590). As argued below, this makes it difficult to analyze why certain ideas gain efficacy in terms of structural importance and not others. Hence, Wendt cannot explain why, for example, it is anarchy that is characteristic of the international system, at a particular moment in time, rather than rivalry. Thirdly, Wendt completely separates the 'logic of anarchy' from the 'logic of capital' in his analysis of the states-system and its potential transformation into a world state (Wendt 2003, 494). Such 'bracketing' divorces the relation of capitalist development from state formation processes whilst also then collapsing analysis into a single logic in which the power dynamics of anarchy prevail. This undercuts any appreciation of the internal relationship between the geopolitical circumstances of the states-system and capital accumulation. In IR theory, Friedrich Kratochwil and John Ruggie have gone further than most in their social constructivist conceptualizations. They have highlighted that the intersubjective quality of convergent expectations, as the basis for international regimes, is not accessible to mainstream approaches, which treat ideas simply as independent variables. Instead, the incorporation of social constructivist insights</page><page sequence="5">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 107 and methods is necessary for explanation to proceed (Kratochwil and Ruggie 1986, 771). Kratochwil argues that international relationships resemble the inter subjective dimension of games. Positivists can only observe the 'facts' of overt behavior. "Beyond that lies the realm of intersubjective rules which are constitu? tive of social practice, and which an interpretive epistemology has to uncover" (Kratochwil 1988, 277; see also Kratochwil 1989). This focus on constitutive rules may provide a non-causal, explanatory account in certain situations plus a narrative explanatory form, which "is established through a process of successive interroga? tive reasoning between explanans and explanandum" (Ruggie 1998, 34). Without a conception of constitutive rules, it is "impossible to provide endogenously the non-causal explanations that constitutive rules embody and which are logically prior to the domain in which causal explanations take effect" (Ruggie 1998, 24). This research agenda has set out to problematize the identities and interests of states, to open up the historical constitution of the states-system, and to reflect on issues of systemic change. Intersubjective frameworks of meaning are attached to social norms that are not taken as simple descriptive categories but as components of generative structures that shape, condition, and constrain action (Ruggie 1982, 1983, 1993). For example, rather than assuming an undifferentiated states-system inceptive from the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Ruggie instead attempts to account for the historical specificity of medieval and modern geopolitical orders to reveal the social construction of transformations in the international states-system. The shift from the medieval to the modern international system is surmized as an instance of change in the basic structure of property rights, alongside transforma? tions in strategic behavior among major actors, and alterations in epistemic condi? tions consisting of political doctrines and metaphysical assumptions (Ruggie 1982, 281-283; Ruggie 1993, 168-169). Elsewhere, in his analysis of 'embedded liberal? ism' in the post-Wo rid War II economic order, Ruggie also asks why it was that the social purpose of the postwar order continued to be maintained to some extent after the collapse of Bretton Woods in the 1970s, despite the fact that the USA had ceased to maintain this system as a hegemon. In response, he argues that international regimes are not only a reflection of the underlying power structure, but are "a fusion of power and legitimate social purpose" (Ruggie 1982, 404). Hence, while the underlying power structure changed with the decline of USA hegemony, the regime of embedded liberalism was maintained as a result of the continuation of its legitimized social purpose. However, whilst Ruggie's analyses of either the shift from the medieval to the modern international states-system, or the evolving monetary and trade regimes since the early 1970s, can demonstrate various features constitutive of geopoliti? cal orders, what he cannot explain is why this has happened and why other politi? cal authority structures did not come to dominate. As one recent and compelling critique attests, no clear, definitive argument is permitted to emerge within these accounts of system transformation, as all factors of explanation are held to be equally irreducible to one another (Teschke 2003, 27-32). In this vari? ant, social constructivism offers a causally indeterminate sketch of the modern states-system and "fails to identify those social agents that sustained, lived out, and changed property titles?not merely as formal institutions, but as politically maintained and actively negotiated social relations" (Teschke 2003, 29, 1998, 330). A pluralist framework is thus evident within social constructivist arguments that grants the same indistinguishable weight to different factors in explaining changes in the international states-system. Yet, in terms of tracing the causes and consequences of the capitalist states-system, social constructivists can be subjected to C. Wright Mills (1959, 154) criticism that "what are often taken as historical explanations would better be taken as part of the statement of that which is to be explained." This means that within social constructivism there is confusion over the relation between explanandum (or principle of historical explanation)</page><page sequence="6">108 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE and explanans (or point of reference that itself explains the changing character of the modern world) (Anderson 1992, 121; Rosenberg 2000, 3). Whilst no clear cut distinction is implied by this contrast, to treat social facts specifically in terms of the latter would endow them with a sense of absolute autonomy, eliding how particular material institutional forms condition and circumscribe discursive power relations in a determinate historical conjuncture. Elsewhere, social constructivism has increasingly been applied in comparative IPE. Two prominent examples are dealt with here in more detail. Mark Blyth analyzes the embedding as well as disembedding of the USA and Swedish politi? cal economies in the 20th century and the role ideas have played within these processes of structural change. In times of crisis, he argues, "ideas allow agents to reduce uncertainty, propose a particular solution to a moment of crisis, and empower agents to resolve that crisis by constructing new institutions in line with these new ideas" (Blyth 2002, 11). Unlike many other social constructivists, he links the emergence of new ideas to material relations. His narrative of disem? bedding liberalism in Sweden, for example, mentions several times the impor? tance of business in the promotion and dissemination of neoliberal ideas from the mid-1970s onwards, and he highlights specifically the vast financial resources capital employed to this effect (Blyth 2002, 209-219, 228, 262, 269). Neverthe? less, there is an ad hoc nature to the linkage of ideas to material relations stem? ming from an underdeveloped conceptualization of the social relations of production, which leads to the neglect of two interrelated and crucial factors. First, at a methodological level, Blyth identifies capital, labor, and the state as core collective homogenous actors, a move developed through his critical engagement with methodological individualism (Blyth 2002, 13-14). Thereby, Blyth implicitly draws on a corporatist understanding of agency without, however, adequately conceptualizing or substantiating this choice of actors. Similar to Wendt, core actors are simply identified on an external basis and are not inter? nally related within the constructivist approach itself. Second, this has serious ramifications for the empirical study of the case of Sweden. Capital was not only important for the direct dissemination and financing of neoliberal ideas in Sweden but it also held a position of structural power more broadly because of its ability to transfer production units abroad. Hence Blyth overlooks the point that it was not capital in general but Swedish transnational capital in particular that was intrinsic to the promotion of neoliberal economics, supported on several significant occasions by forces of transnational labor, such as inter alia in the separate collective wage agreement between employers and trade unions in the transnational metalworking sector in 1983, the pro-European Union (EU) membership campaign in 1994 (Bieler 2000, 46, 102-110), and the pro European Monetary Union (EMU) membership campaign in 2003 (Bieler 2006, 96-97, 143-145). A conceptualization of the changing Swedish social relations of production in processes of transnational restructuring would have indicated the growing significance of the structural power of transnational capital (Bieler 2006, 59-66). In short, as positive as Blyth's advance is over other constructivist approaches, he does not fully comprehend the importance of material structural conditions in their internal relation to ideas. He adopts a dualistic view of material structure and ideas that are always-already separated as variables that are then combined in their external relationship to one another (e.g., Blyth 2002, 251). This means that ideas and material conditions are treated as two independent entities based on their external relation to one another, which are then combined in a func? tional relation as independent and dependent variables. We will come back to an analysis of the internal relationship between the two, and the related notion of the material structure of ideas, when outlining a historical materialist concep? tion of the structuring of ideas. Only then, it will be argued, can one begin to</page><page sequence="7">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 109 understand why a particular set of ideas may triumph over another at a particular point in time. Another social constructivist contribution is made by Leonard Seabrooke's analysis of how states legitimate their policies in the conflict over the distribution of resources within the financial reform nexus (credit and property access and tax burdens) between lower income groupings (LIGs) and rentiers, who live on passive and unearned income. Seabrooke aims to analyze how the settlement of this conflict "bolsters or undermines its creation of a broad and deep domestic pool of capital that the state and private financial institutions may then employ internationally" (Leonard Seabrooke 2006, 3). He argues that the more favor? able a state's policies are toward LIGs, the larger is the domestic capital pool, which in turn implies a stronger role in the international financial system for this state. Seabrooke draws to a large extent on constructivist assumptions in that he accepts that money and credit are fundamentally social constructions. However, this is also related to a belief about the legitimacy of these social constructions. Hence, he criticizes constructivists such as Blyth for: "(i) a persistent selection bias toward moments of radical uncertainty and periods of embeddedness; and (ii) a view of legitimacy by proclamation because of an overwhelming focus on institutional and ideational entrepreneurs" (Seabrooke 2006, 38). Hence, by drawing on the work of Max Weber, he adds to social constructivism "a concep? tion of legitimacy as a process in which social groups contest economic social norms within everyday life" (Seabrooke 2006, 42). In short, the focus is on incre? mental social change as a result of specific historical legitimacy contests between the state and social groups (Seabrooke 2006, 46). Ultimately, though, Seabrooke does not escape the wider shortcomings of social constructivism. His empirical case studies of the conflicts in society between LIGs and rentiers over influence on the state and related financial poli? cies reveal that, in most instances, rentiers triumph over LIGs. "Most states do not intervene positively into their financial reform nexuses for LIGs and impede their international financial capacity by instead supporting rentier interests. And in some cases they directly support a 'rentier shift'" (Seabrooke 2006, 173). This is despite the fact that such action is against states' own best interests in relation to their role in the international financial system, as Seabrooke generally argues. He thus outlines how this has happened in his case studies, but the question as to why rentiers may win, or lose, over LIGs in a particular empirical context is left unquestioned. The latter could be pursued if reference was made to the power structures underlying the struggle between these actors and the state, but again such a conceptualization is forestalled. In summary, the problem of social constructivism, as a theory of history, is that it is grounded in an idealist understanding of transformations in social relations because of the disembedding of intersubjective ideas, norms and values from the social relations in which they cohere. In other words, the interrelatedness and influence of the ideal/material is posed as always-already separate and combined entities, and constructivism fails to live up to its own claims of resolving all manner of contrasting philosophical problems within international theory (see Katzenstein, Keohane, and Krasner 1998; Price and Reus-Smit 1998). The recur? ring questions are therefore: Whose values and beliefs have constituted or embod? ied state identities and interests and the relevant constitutional structure of the international society of states? Which agents shape the core intersubjective beliefs of underlying social and world orders? Why does a particular set of ideas become part of the structure and not another? As it stands, there exists an under-theo? rized notion of power across social constructivist perspectives that fail to ascer? tain whose interpretations come to constitute the social world and why they do so (Adler 1997, 337-338; Checkel 1998, 325). The end result is that constructiv? ism as a whole stands as merely the latest reincarnation and manifestation of</page><page sequence="8">110 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE liberal theorizing, reaching similarly bland conclusions about social change as mainstream approaches (Morton 2005a, 502-506; Sterling-Folker 2000; Teschke and Heine 2002). The Discourse of Poststructuralism Poststructuralist accounts are highly critical of social constructivism for not breaking completely with mainstream, positivist IR theory. As Nalini Persram (1999, 171) argues, "the pseudo-progressive vocabulary of intersubjectivity and all the rest cannot hide the uncritical categories through which constructivism expresses itself." More problematically, rather than providing a challenge to mainstream approaches, by adopting core assumptions?such as a conception of the state as an anthropomorphic actor (e.g. Wendt 1999, 10)?social constructiv? ism actually cements the predominance of the mainstream within the discipline, simultaneously closing down alternative critical ways of thinking. In short, simply adding an ideational dimension to the overall structure without questioning how the social and/or world order and the subjects within it are constituted does not go far enough. The main focus of poststructuralism is the way in which social subjects are con? stituted in the first place. Instead of seeing structure and agency as two different entities, they are taken as directly implicated in each other through discursive practices (Doty 1997). "Subjectivity and the social order are constituted together, the social order being the frame within which subjectivities are placed. The social order only comes into existence by our positing it in advance, assuming that it already exists, and in doing this we are ourselves constituted as subjects" (Edkins and Pin-Fat 1999, 5). As a result, the moment when a new social order is established becomes crucial. Jenny Edkins' distinction between 'politics' and 'the political' is important in this respect. Politics refers to the technical arrange? ments within an established social order and identified subjects. For example, neorealist IR theory assumes that international politics, as the social or world order, is dominated by states, as the subjects. What neorealists analyze, then, is the politics of state interaction. What they cannot question, however, is the assumed social or world order and the subjects themselves. Subject and state formation is taken for granted. Poststructuralists, by contrast, concentrate on the political, the founding moment, when the myth of a new social or world order is established. According to Edkins (1999, 13), "the founding moment is the moment of decisioning, the moment that both produces and reproduces the law." An example of such a founding moment would be the significance of 1989 within processes of European integration, when a new order could be enacted through the inclusion and legitimacy of Central and Eastern Europe within the regional social order. As a critical strategy, then, poststructuralists turn their attention to these founding moments, when a new master signifier is established. They concentrate on questioning what is generally taken as given. "In a sense, the duty of the critical intellectual is exactly this not forgetting, this drawing of attention to the produced, artificial, contingent character of any reigning master signifier" (Edkins 1999, 140). In other words, the IR scholar is set the task of challenging "the hegemony of the power relations or symbolic order in whose name security is produced, to render visible its contingent, provisional nature" (Edkins 1999, 142). Accepting, however, the contingent character of a master signifier implies that there can never be a moment of ontological fullness, a moment of establish? ing clearly the material and ideational basis of a particular social or world order as well as the subjects within it. Hence, the subject is fragmented and decen tered: "in this picture, the subject is always in the process of being constituted; there is no point at which, however briefly, the performance is finished. In some</page><page sequence="9">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 111 sense the subject does not exist..." (Edkins and Pin-Fat 1999, 1). Accepting any structure as foundational is, therefore, impossible from a poststructuralist account. It is in this respect that poststructuralism then criticizes critical IPE the? ories. The latter, although claiming to challenge key mainstream assumptions, nonetheless are charged with simply replacing one foundation with another, upholding a view of "a heroic subject in estrangement" that is presented as "the necessary, central figure of any labor that would have critical, emancipatory, transformative potentials" (Ashley 1996, 243, 248). In other words, by taking as foundational the structures of historical processes, which are understood to determine the realms of the possible, analysis within critical IPE remains caught within modernist assumptions (Ashley 1989, 275). Poststructuralist reflections on the international engagements of critical activity are thus presented rather differently. Ashley (1996, 242) has pushed himself to consider an 'interpretation of circumstances' in which such critical activity emerges to focus on the undecidability of claims to sovereignty. He casts out the lonely figure of the 'itinerate condottiere' that he posits as equivalent to his pos? ture towards understanding the constitutive field of international studies (Ashley 1996, 250-253). In medieval Italy, condottieres led armies for different cities and rulers depending on who paid them most, without attaching themselves too closely to a particular city or ruler on a principled basis. Thus, the itinerate condottiere exists in a condition of "estranged unsituatedness" that "lives the life of a vagabond" as "a stranger to every place and faith," that is "never at home among the people who dwell there," as a nomad constantly facing forceful evic? tion. Similarly, the poststructuralist, Ashley continues, holds an "ideal of inhabit? ing a securely bounded territory of truth and transparent meaning beyond doubt, a place given as if by some author beyond time, a place where it is possi? ble to appeal to the word in order to decide what things mean..." (Ashley 1996, 252). Nevertheless, at the same time, because the poststructuralist asserts the arti? ficial nature of any such bounded territory of truth and order, the short-lived order is not mistaken as the concrete realization of the ideal. Rather, the post structuralist accepts that the ideal of such a territory of truth can never be fully achieved. This in itself is considered to be more desirable than the mistaken assumption that there could be something such as an ontologically true social order and its subjects within it. When this understanding is related to moves in IR theory to consider the way ideas defined in a broad way can be conceptualized, it is clear that from a post structuralist perspective they cannot be regarded as a part of the ontological structure. Instead, there is a conception of ideas as discourse (which is more than language) surrounding the political, or the moment a new myth is deployed to establish a particular social/world order. What poststructuralists propose "is a recognition of the contingency of present political forms and the discourses that we use to produce and describe them" (Edkins and Zehfuss 2005, 470). Hence, discourses establish the truth for a temporarily limited moment. As a result, poststructuralists claim to reject the very distinction between the material and the ideational expressed within constructivism. "Dis? courses provide criteria of intelligibility that establish the conditions of possibility for social being and, as such, cannot be considered as separate from, or second? ary to, the material realm" (de Goede 2001, 152). For instance, in attempting to criticize the current international financial order, de Goede does not concen? trate on a material structure. Instead "in order to criticise the legitimacy deficit in finance and to broaden financial debates, it is imperative to understand how financial science became a historical possibility and how financial decision making became depoliticized in the first place" (de Goede 2001, 151). This is traced through the historical constitution of financial speculation as a technical issue, which depoliticizes the circumstances surrounding notions of risk. Once</page><page sequence="10">112 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE discourses of financial speculation as well as the discursive constitution of mod? ern finance more broadly are deconstructed, the process of thinking about possi? ble alternatives can then begin (de Goede 2005, xxvi; de Goede 2004). However, it is doubtful whether the above approaches to the role, or social function, of the theorist in revealing such acts of deconstruction is adequate. Ashley's self-image of the itinerate condottiere?a noble that chooses the life of organizing mercenary activity in order to increase revenue?merely compounds similarly problematic reflections on the conditions of emergence of poststructu? ralism in international studies. For example, it most notably evokes the status of dissident theorists questioning narratives of sovereignty from the position of dis? ciplinary exiles (Ashley and Walker 1990). It also retains resonance within the assumption that intellectual activity involves constantly shifting ethico-political responsibility between "coalitions of support and political advocacy... seen as constituted, temporary and issue-based" (Edkins and Zehfuss 2005, 468). The itinerate nature of ethical commitments, furthermore, links with David Camp? bell's reflections on the duty, obligation and responsibility of poststructuralist theorizing that involves a struggle for, and on behalf of, the Other and thus the necessity of a deterritorialization of responsibility (Campbell 1999, 50-51). His focus is cast toward the delineation of ethico-political criteria within inter? national engagements that involve "a philosophical anthropology of everyday life on a global scale," which is emergent from "specific, local inquiries of political questions, inquiries that focus on how problems in international politics are problematized." These ethico-political criteria are marked in international studies through "inside/outside distinctions" that "are the geographical-spatial exemplars of self/other demarcations" (Campbell 2001, 445-446). Yet within these divergent considerations of scholarly international engagements (the unrooted, shifting, global-travelling condottiere and the specific localist of everyday life committed to de-territorialized responsibility) scant attention is cast to situat? ing poststructuralism within its own historical conditions of emergence. Akin to developments elsewhere in the social sciences, the point can be sustained that there is an obfuscation within poststructuralism that mystifies its own relationship to social conditions linked to global capitalism which, however fragmented in appearance and circumstance, serve as a structuring principle of social relations (Dirlikl994, 331). Moreover, despite denying ontological foundations, poststructuralists in IPE fall short in a similar manner to social constructivists when attempting to estab? lish the role of discourses within social power relations. Louise Amoore outlines well how the discourse of linking risk/uncertainty to globalization "has become central to programmes of work flexibilization, casualization, and fragmentation" (Amoore 2004, 175), thereby exerting pressure on workers and individualizing uncertainty and risk. What she does not explain, however, is why this particular discourse became dominant. There is a failure here to uncover the agency and structural power behind discourses of risk. Similarly, in his analysis of the shift away from final salary pension schemes in Anglo-American capitalism, Paul Lang ley (2004a, 541) asserts that "there is a need to ask how the current financializa tion of capitalism is taking place at the expense of other possible restructurings." What is missing is the analysis of why this shift occurs and who has deployed it as a strategy of social power. Elsewhere, in an examination of IPE literature on the New International Financial Architecture, he also claims that analysis should not be restricted to a critical assessment of International Financial Institutions, "but should also explicitly recognize the discursive features of authority relations and situate governance networks in the power relations, contestation, contradictions and reproduction of the global financial order" (Langley 2004b, 84). In practice, however, there is a sole concentration on discourse without examining the internal relation of dominant discourses as</page><page sequence="11">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 113 material social processes. Specifically, statements such as "the institutional focus of much existing IPE research should be combined with a concern with the dis? cursive dynamics of authority relations" located in global financial governance (Langley 2004b, 73), echo the always-al ready separate and combined approach to ideal/material relations evident within social constructivism. This separation is most starkly apparent in the clear binary line drawn by Louise Amoore (2004, 186 emphasis added) between the material and ideational in her account of dis? courses of risk: The transformation of working practices must be understood as more than sim? ply a response to the material reality of an uncertain global economy; instead it relies upon the ideational production and reproduction of ways of thinking about risk and uncertainty. What is evident here is precisely an act of inscribing ontological centrality to ideas, a moment that not only clearly establishes and separates the material and ideational dimensions but also grants causal priority to the latter in political economy.2 Furthermore, poststructuralists in IPE assert that at any juncture, any political moment, different outcomes are possible within the contingent and conjunctur ally specific power relations of global capitalism (Langley 2004b, 71, 75). The dif? ferent problem here, though, is that despite uncovering and sequencing how a particular discourse might become established in a specific period of time, total contingency is prioritized (see Morton 2005b, 441-444). Thus, whilst a poststruc? turalist gaze can be effectively cast over what Foucault (1980, 92, 2003, 24) termed the "how of power," in terms of the effects of hegemonic discourses, there is nevertheless abnegation in refraining from asking the who of power (see also Marsden 1999, 26, 192).3 This is revealed in Foucault's deliberation on the functioning of society when stating that "the best conditions for this functioning may be defined internally, without one being able to say 'for whom' it is best that things may be like that," thus effacing questions of cui bono? intrinsic to political economy (Foucault 1999, 100).4 Whilst power may very well be regarded as relational, or produced through social interaction, there is thus little indica? tion of the direct social agents of relational power (Edkins, Pin-Fat, and Shapiro 2004, 2; Edkins and Pin-Fat 2005, 406). Who practices hegemony? Why might one discourse have been successful in a specific historical context and underpin the distribution of material entitlements and not other, rival discourses in power struggles? What is lost in the game of discursivity is any point of condensation within social power relations, or, put differently, how the discipline of capital 2 Such attempts to prioritize ideational production are actually contrary to Michel Foucault's own stance on the exercise of power. "Power relations, relationships of communication, objective capacities should not," he argues, "...be confused. This is not to say that there is a question of three separate domains. Nor that there is, on the one hand, the field of things, of perfected technique, work, and the transformation of the real, and on the other, that of signs, communication, reciprocity, and the production of meaning" (Foucault 2000, 337-338). 3 We are aware here of Foucault's statement that, "If for the time being, I grant a certain privileged position to the question of 'how,' it is not because I would wish to eliminate the questions of 'what' and 'why.'" However, his preference for a focus on power relations rather than power itself?with power relations regarded as linked but dis? tinct from objective capacities?is still troubling. Power relations become embedded within a complex and indis? tinct "ensemble of actions" (Foucault 2000, 336). With the limits of space preventing a full development of this point, the problem here is locating power within a vague ensemble of social relations, which may throw up a theory of individuality but obscures the history of social formations linked to the conditions of production and reproduc? tion constitutive of material relations of existence in the labor process (Althusser 2003, 254, 290). For a preferential treatment of processes of individuation?or the 'isolation effect'?of the state that facilitates an interpretation of the fragmentation and atomization of social agents through the capitalist labor process, see Poulantzas (1973, 130 137). We develop this focus on individuation processes intrinsic to capitalism in the next section. This quotation is referred to in Pern' Anderson's (1983, 57) critique of the capsizing of both structure and subject within poststructuralism.</page><page sequence="12">114 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE structures concrete individuals and the interpellation of identities. Poststructural? ists, to paraphrase Stuart Hall (1996, 136), might therefore save for themselves 'the political,' but they deny themselves a politics due to their neglect of histori? cal relations of force. The result is a rendering of capitalist exploitation and domination into a shapeless and contingent world of fetishized self/other differ? ences. This is reflected in a focus on the "arbitrary play of actions upon actions ?actions that are not attributable to any ultimate source" (Ashley 1996, 244; see also Doty 1997, 377). To draw from Fernando Coronil (1992, 99-100), there is a repudiation of metanarratives here that produces disjointed mininarratives, which in reacting against "determinism," presents a series of free-floating events. The hegemony of discourse therefore becomes a phagocytic essence, absorbing and engulfing everything within the discursive (Poulantzas 1978, 151). We turn now to an historical materialist analysis of these issues in an attempt to explain precisely this problem through an emphasis on the internal relation of ideas as material social processes. This requires, however, a prior discussion of why a historical materialist approach is not, by default, economistic. Historical Materialism and the Fetishism of Commodities Bob Jessop (1990, 295) has argued that if the only properties which entities have are the product of discourse then one could discursively turn base metal into gold. This line of argument is completely neglected in de Goede's attempt to clarify "the precise ways in which value and entitlements are created and distrib? uted in modern capitalist practices" (de Goede 2003, 82). For her, "capital itself seems to be discursively constituted and contested" to the extent that capital is brought into being through historically grounded discourses, through "money's discursivity" so that "money, credit and capital are, quite literally, systems of writing" (de Goede 2003, 89; de Goede 2001, 151-152). It seems highly appropriate to raise questions about the historical constitution of financial markets and how money, profit and value are generated in late-mod? ern capitalist practices. In short by asking "what is capital?" (de Goede 2003, 90 original emphasis). Yet, an immediate counter-response would be: does money possess discursivity? Further, is there not a lack of engagement here with a stream of classic social theory that has precisely grappled with modernity and the spe? cific forms of social power deriving from the historical and social constitution of processes of capitalist development (Rosenberg 1994a)? In wanting to question the ways in which value and entitlements are created and distributed in modern capitalism, the role played by financial markets, money, profit, and value therein, our argument is that there is a reinvention of the wheel here that expunges from the contours of debate the contributions of classic social theory. In sum, the question that needs to be added to 'what is capital?' is quite simply 'where is Capital?' Within the language of Capital there is a clear interrogation of the social constitution of the world linked to the 'life process of society' understood as the historically specific conditions of productive activity (Marx 1887/1996, 90). Marx wants to reveal the mystery, 'the magic and necromancy,' which surrounds the products of labor that take the form of fetishized commodities. His central ques? tion is "why is labor represented by the value of its product and labor time by the magnitude of that value?," which is tackled by demonstrating that categories of classical political economy take as given the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labor through the fetishism inherent in commodities (Marx 1887/1996, 93). "The characters that stamp," he argues, "products as commodi? ties, and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities, have already acquired the stability of natural, self-understood forms of social life, before man (sic, as throughout) seeks to decipher, not their</page><page sequence="13">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 115 historical character, for in his eyes they are immutable, but their meaning" (Marx 1887/1996, 86). Fetishism, then, is an act that is attached to the products of labor in the commodity form, which is inseparable from the production of commodities. In the case of commodities, the value relation between the prod? ucts of labor which create the commodities have no relation with physical prop? erties nor with material relations. It is in this sense that Marx argued, in such cases of commodity production, that "it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes... the fantastic form of a relation between things." Subse? quently stating that "this fetishism of commodities has its origin... in the pecu? liar social character of the labor that produces them" (Marx 1887/1996, 83). This is not an emphasis on objectified, reified institutions as they appear to us?as the properties of things, or as money possessing discursivity?but rather a focus on material relations between persons as the social relations between things. Marx is also concerned here with dissipating "the mist through which the social character of labor appears to us to be an objective character of the prod? ucts themselves," which is linked to questions of value. In his view, "the mystical character of commodities does not originate... in their use value" (Marx 1887/1996, 82, 85). Moreover, to discuss solely the discursive categories of money, profit, and value would be tantamount to abstracting from their inequali? ties. To concentrate on the discursive fixing of value would, after all, remain ignorant of the practices of inequality, exploitation and immizeration constitu? tive of such value. "Value, therefore, does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts every product into a social hiero? glyphic," and to decipher this is crucial, "for to stamp an object of utility as a value, 'is just as much a social product as language'" (Marx 1887/1996, 85 emphasis added). Further, when the proportions of specific products have attained a certain sta? bility, they appear as natural products, "so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value, as a pound of gold and a pound of iron, in spite of their different physical and chemical quantities, appear to be of equal weight" (Marx 1887/1996, 85). The character of having value, therefore, only obtains fixity through the ascription of value, although it takes the appearance and form of the action of objects. But it would be mistaken to assume then that the base metal of iron can be discursively turned into gold. Rather, it is the labor time socially necessary for the production of such com? modities alongside the inherent properties of objects that determine the ascrip? tion of value. "The determination of the magnitude of value by labor time is therefore a secret, hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative value of commodities" (Marx 1887/1996, 86). Marx wishes to trace the "cabalistic signs" of money within which the value relation is lost in the names of curren? cies (such as the dollar or euro), "because these money names express both the values of commodities, and, at the same time, aliquot5 parts of the weight of the metal that was the standard of money" (Marx 1887/1996, 110). As Theodor Adorno (2000, 32) warns, a na?ve acceptance of media such as money as a self-evident form of equivalence, a medium of exchange?or simply a discursive system of writing?relieves people of the need for reflection on the specific social relationships governing the system of exchange, or discursive writing, in the first place. The relations through which the social world attains 'objectivity/ whereby exter? nalized products of human activity appear as if they are real, are therefore part of the above process known as objectivation or reification. Far from representing an An aliquot part simply means (of a part or portion) contained by a whole within a number of times (e.g., four is an aliquot part of 12).</page><page sequence="14">116 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE economistic rendering of social reality, this awareness raises meaningful questions about the very objectivations of subjective processes in human activity, or the ways in which the socially constructed world is intersubjectively realized (Bieler and Morton 2001, 17-21). It thus offers an historical materialist mode of enquiry into the conditions and constitution of productive activity by suggesting a way in which the characteristic institutional forms and social practices of capitalism can be understood. Within a historical materialist theory of history, there is therefore a novel vantage point from which to consider factors, not as variables independent of one another, but as internally related. This philosophy of internal relations means that the character of capital is considered as a social relation in such a way that the internal ties between the means of production, and those who own them, as well as those who work them, as well as the realization of value within historically specific conditions, are all understood as relations internal to each other (Oilman 1976, 47). This is distinct from viewing such relations as a set of external connections and treating capital as a simple variable. For as Bertell Oilman (2003, 69) attests, "capital is itself a relation in which the ties of the material means of production to labor, value, commodity, etc, are interiorized as parts of what capital is." In sum? marizing this philosophy of internal relations he also states that, "the relations that come together to make up the whole get expressed in what are taken to be its parts" (Oilman 2003, 70). The appearance of relations as external?taken as a given by social constructivists or as simply discursively constructed by poststructu? ralists, as demonstrated earlier?arises precisely as a result of the process of reifica tion and the alienation of labor under capitalism (Gould 1978, 93). As a consequence of this philosophy of internal relations, the social ontology of historical materialism?that takes as primary the social organization of produc? tion and the very process of objectivation through which human beings exist?is able to offer a non-reductionist and open-ended view of capital (Rupert 1995, 16). After all, as Robert Cox (1987, 1) has stated, "production creates the mate? rial basis for all forms of social existence, and the ways in which human efforts are combined in productive processes affect all other aspects of social life, including the polity." This starting point, however, does not serve to establish a distinction between the economic and the political realms in an ahistoric way. Rather, it promotes a precise conceptualization of the historical and social con? stitution of particular social relations of production and the emergence of related political and economic institutions. An historical materialist approach asks why is it that these two spheres appear to be separate in capitalism in the first place. In contrast to poststructuralists such as de Goede, who contends "that historically constructed discourses of the economy have made possible this sepa? ration between the domain of the economic and the domain of the political" (de Goede 2005, 2), the answer is sought through the philosophy of internal relations. This recognizes that under capitalist property relations, the direct extraction of surplus is accomplished through 'non-political' relations conducted through a contractual relation between those who maintain the power of appro? priation as owners of the means of production over those who only have their labor to sell as expropriated producers (Burnham 1995; Rupert 1995, 21; Wood 1995, 31-36). On this basis, state and civil society, the political and the eco? nomic, are not understood as given or discursively constructed, separate entities, which are then externally related to each other, but as expressions of the same configuration of capitalist social relations of production. Hence, an internal relationship is acknowledged that includes, for example, the way private property is legally ensured by the state, so that forms of power such as 'the law' may be seen as both an instrument through which definitions of property are imposed or maintained and an ideology in active relationship to social norms through which class relations are mediated. Productive relations are therefore in part meaning? ful in terms of their very definition in law in civil society, although "the anatomy</page><page sequence="15">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 117 of this civil society... has to be sought in political economy" (Marx 1859/1987, 262; Thompson 1975, 261; Wood 1995, 22). According to Marx, the state has a set of presuppositions in civil society in terms of religion, the judiciary, private property, and the family. Under capitalist social relations these become divided into separate spheres. Therefore, the divi? sion of 'state' from 'civil society' unfolds as a discrete form of capitalist social relations. This induces a mystification of the powers of the state to the extent that collective identities become separated into individual elements. The public and private spheres are shorn, so that individual freedom forms the foundation of civil society and class exploitation is set aside to give decisive status to abstract citizenship (Marx 1843a/1975, 77-78, 81). Civil society therefore becomes equa? ted with individual rights and private interests and "appears as a framework external to the individuals, as a restriction of their original independence" (Marx 1843b/1975, 164). The individual is presented as an 'isolated monad' with the state regarding "civil society, the world of needs, labor, private interests, civil law, as the basis of its existence, as a precondition not requiring further substantia? tion and therefore as its natural basis' (Marx 1843b/1975, 167 original empha? ses). Yet, declares Marx, "sovereignty is nothing but the objectified mind of the subjects of the state" and the very social existence of people within the state constitutes their participation and relation to the state. "They are not only part of the state, but the state is their portion" (1843a/1975, 24, 26, 117 original emphasis). It is this radicalized social ontology, as outlined by Mark Rupert (1995, 16), that is the basis for an historically specific understanding of the organization of production. It is also closely related to Antonio Gramsci's own rejection of all kinds of economism, including the notion that economic crisis would result in an inevitable, automatic historical transformation of society (Gramsci 1971, 168). In more detail, Gramsci argued that economic crisis would not automatically give rise to political crisis, or that ideas can be read off as mere epiphenomena of material forces, because '"civil society' has become a very complex structure and one which is resistant to the catastrophic 'incursions' of the immediate economic element (crises, depressions, etc.)" (Gramsci 1971, 235). Instead, the cultural sphere of the socio-political class struggle through which hegemony is con? structed tends to lag behind the thrust of economic events, slowing down the weight of economic crisis. "It may be ruled out," Gramsci (1971, 184) stated, "that immediate economic crises of themselves produce fundamental historical events; they can simply create the terrain more favorable to the dissemination of certain modes of thought."6 As Rosenberg (1994b, 53 original emphasis) has commented, "the central thesis of historical materialism is not economic deter? minism; it is the centrality of those relations which organize material production to the wider institutional reproduction of social orders." As will be demonstrated in the following section, it is here that the philosophy of internal relations articu? lated by historical materialism, specifically in terms of a dialectical connectedness of ideas as material social processes, becomes apparent in a non-deterministic understanding of structural change. The Material Structure of Ideas Eric Hobsbawm has noted that, following the revolutions of 1830 and despite the regional variations in social and economic organization across Europe, the decisive importance of capital cities as a locus for revolt gained widespread b Also witness Gramsci stating that "it is illusory to think that a well propagated 'clear idea' enters diverse con? sciousness with the same 'organizing' effects of widespread clarity. It is an 'enlightenment' error" (see Gramsci 1985, 417; 1992, 128).</page><page sequence="16">118 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE acceptance. However, by the time further revolution spread across the continent after 1848, "governments began to replan them in order to facilitate the opera? tion of troops against [the] revolutionaries" (Hobsbawm 1962, 129). "For the city planners," he continues, "the poor were a public danger, their potentially riotous concentrations to be broken up by avenues and boulevards which would drive the inhabitants of the crowded popular quarters they replaced into some unspecified, but presumably more sanitary and certainly less perilous locations" (Hobsbawm 1975, 211). The archetypal example is the hiring of Georges-Eug?ne Haussmann (1809-1892) by Napoleon III to 'modernize' Paris in the 1860s with the building of grande boulevards to accommodate new street caf?s and single function urban development (Harvey 2003, 107-116). Richard Sennett (1977, 134-135) has summarized this as the transformation of an ecology of quartiers into an ecology of classes. Gramsci (1971, 365) also drew attention to such state impelled practices and designations, which he regarded as linked to the wider class "realization of a hegemonic apparatus" in four main ways. First, he referred to the overarching importance of the "material structure of ideology" which included issues such as architecture alongside street lay-outs (as well as street names), and the social function performed by libraries, schools, publishing houses, newspapers, and journals, down to the local parish newsletter. Overall awareness of these aspects of social power "would get people into the habit of a more cautious and precise calculation of the forces acting in society" (Gramsci 1995, 155-156), a point that may strike one whether standing on Avenue de la Grande Arm?e, one of Haussmann 's 12 grand avenues radiating from the Arc de Triomphe; or facing El Monumento de la Revoluci?n in M?xico City located on the Plaza de la Rep?blica; or situated opposite the Republic Monument in Taksim Square in Istanbul and its sculpture to the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat?rk; or located on the more humble but still symbolic Viale Gramsci in Rome. It is such a focus on the internal relation of the material structure of ideas that has been explored in the work of David Harvey, notably, tracing transformations in the built environment of modernist architecture in the early 20th century?embodied in the work of Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, or Frank Lloyd Wright?that unfolded "less as a controlling force of ideas over production than as a theoretical framework and justification for what practically-minded engineers, politicians, builders, and developers were in many cases engaged upon out of sheer social, economic and political neces? sity" (Harvey 1989, 69). Likewise, within the postmodernism of the late 20th cen? tury city, Harvey internally associates speculative land, property development and redevelopment in the built environment, to processes of capital accumulation, market and land-rent allocation, and money capital. Linking with our preceding section, "the fetishism (direct concern with surface appearances that conceal underlying meanings) is obvious," according to Harvey (1989, 77-78), "but it is here deployed deliberately to conceal, through the realms of culture and taste, the real base of economic distinctions," which are entailed in establishing enclosed and protected housing and leisure spaces as an expression of class power. Architecture, then, amidst a diverse array of other social condensations (such as cadastral mapping defining property rights over land, or the drawing of territorial boundaries for administration, social control and communication 1 For an extended unravelling of the work of Antonio Gramsci on the themes of hegemony and uneven devel? opment relevant to the contemporary global political economy, see Morton (2007). 8 The political importance of street-naming practices outlined by Gramsci took an ironic turn in Rome in 2002 when a local council proposed the renaming of Viale Gramsci to Viale Chiorboli, in honor of Aldo Chiorboli who tried to rescue a Fascist fighter pilot from his blazing plane only to end up also dying in the process. The plan was to thereby displace Viale Gramsci to a more peripheral secondary- location, within the city, an act regional councillor Carl Lucherini described as an attempt to cancel history through revisionism. See // Messaggero (Rome), "Gramsci 'sfrattato' va in periferia: arriva il nuovo 'eroe,'" (28 September 2002, 39).</page><page sequence="17">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 119 routes) provides an opportunity to question the role played by discursive produc? tive meanings embedded within the economy through analysis of the internal relations within the 'material structure of ideology.' Second, these social condensations of hegemony are the means by which a "'diffused' and capillary form of indirect pressure" becomes mediated through various organizations?or "capillary intellectual meatuses"?to exercise hege? monic class relations (Gramsci 1971, 110; Gramsci 1985, 194). Gramsci is thus a paramount theorist of capillary power due to his attentiveness to the social class meatuses of "capillary sources of capitalist profit" (Gramsci 1977, 82; Gramsci 1992, 230-231).9 Hegemony within the realm of civil society is grasped when the citizenry come to believe that authority over their lives emanates from the self. Hegemony is therefore articulated through capillary power?akin to "an incor? poreal government"?when it is transmitted organically through various "social infusoria" such as schools, street layout and names, architecture, the family, workplace, or church (Gramsci 1977, 143-144). Hence "within the husk of polit? ical society a complex and well-articulated civil society," is evident, "?n which the individual can govern himself without his self-government thereby entering into conflict with political society?but rather becoming its normal continuation, its organic complement" (Gramsci 1971, 268 emphasis added). It was this separa? tion, outlined earlier, that Marx saw as characteristic of the structuring of socie? ties leading to the naturalization of the distinctive forms of modernity. That is why, in his view: Security is the highest social concept of civil society... expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property... The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism. On the contrary, security is the insur? ance of its egoism (Marx 1843b/1975, 162-163, original emphases). Embedded within this process of naturalization is therefore the struggle over hegemony. Hence, for historical materialism "ideologies are anything but arbi? trary; they are real historical facts which must be combated and their nature as instruments of domination exposed... precisely for reasons of political struggle" (Gramsci 1995, 395). Third, according to Gramsci, 'ideology' was neither artificial nor something mechanically superimposed. Rather, ideologies were viewed as historically pro? duced through ceaseless struggle, taking on substance through practical activity bound up with systems of meaning embedded in the economy (Gramsci 1996, 56). "Ideas are realized when they find their justification?and the means to assert themselves?in economic reality" (Gramsci 1994, 56). Importantly, not all ideas are relevant. "Ideas only become effective if they do, in the end, connect with a particular constellation of social forces. In that sense, ideological struggle is a part of the general social struggle for mastery and leadership?in short for hegemony" (Hall 1986, 42). Consequently, ideas represent an independent force when maintained in dialectical connectivity, or internally related, with the social relations of production. Only those ideas can be regarded as 'organic' that "organize human masses, and create the terrain on which men move, acquire consciousness of their position, struggle, etc." (Gramsci 1971, 377). Related to this, is the twofold distinction drawn between "historically organic ideologies" 9 Whilst space restrictions limit full elaboration, this conception differs in marked ways from the focus on dis? cursive formations and architecture in The Archaeology of Knowledge (Foucault 1972), essentially because of the inde? terminate determinism within Foucault's notion of capillary power (see Wight 1999, 121). This results in a focus on architecture as "complex structures of discourse-practice in which objects, entities and activities are defined and constructed within the domain of a discursive formation" (Hirst 2005, 156). The phagocytic essence of discourse is again present here.</page><page sequence="18">120 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE and those based on extemporary polemics that are "arbitrary, rationalistic, or 'willed.'" Hence highlighting "real action on the one hand... and on the other hand the gladiatorial futility which is self-declared action but modifies only the word, not things, the external gesture" (Gramsci 1971, 307, 376-377). For Gramsci, "it is on the level of ideologies that men become conscious of conflicts in the world of the economy" (Gramsci 1971, 162). These conflicts can be heu ristically analyzed in the form of class struggle in IPE (Cox 1985/1996,57-58). The social relations of production are understood as engendering social class forces as the main collective actors, implying a conflict between capital and labor. However, this importantly does not suggest a homogenous understanding of identities in their class relevance. Depending on the forms of capital within the overall process of surplus accumulation, one can distinguish between differ? ent circuits of financial and industrial capital and labor as well as, depending on which level production is organized, between national and transnational frac? tions of capital and labor (van Apeldoorn 2002, 26-34; Bieler 2000, 10-11; Bieler 2006, 32-35; Cox 1981, 147; van der Pijl 1984, 4-20). In short, different class fractions are regarded as emerging through the way production is organized in capitalism. As a result, forms of agency can be identified and conceptualized from a historical materialist perspective. The who? question can thus be addressed. Importantly, class identity does not need to imply class-consciousness and com? mon class interests (Ste. Croix 1981, 44). Class-consciousness only emerges out of particular historical contexts of struggle rather than mechanically deriving from objective determinations that have an automatic place in production. Peo? ple "identify points of antagonistic interest, they commence to struggle around these issues and in the process of struggling they discover themselves as classes, they come to know this discovery as class-consciousness" (Thompson 1978, 149). Clearly, there is cognisance here of the diversity of social identities and how these attain class-relevance through processes of exploitation. In short, "'non class' issues?peace, ecology, and feminism?are not to be set aside but given a firm and conscious basis in the social realities shaped through the production process" (Cox 1987, 353; see also Bakker and Gill 2003; Bieler and Morton 2003, 475-457; Cox 1992, 35). Even more importantly, the identification of class relevance does not imply that interests and political strategies are simply deter? mined by the location of social class forces in production processes. Production is only determining in the first instance in that it prevents some strategies and enables others. "Whether any such possibilities are realized, and in what particu? lar ways, depends upon open-ended political struggles in which the power rela? tions of capitalism will necessarily be implicated" (Rupert 2003, 183). There are, in short, always several possible strategies from which social class forces, as bear? ers of both agency and structure, can choose (Bieler and Morton 2001, 16-29). And it is in these struggles that ideas, put forward by different, rival class frac? tions, gain their importance as expressions of conflicts in the social world. Ideas are not ascribed fixed class positions, but at the same time the class-structuring of ideology is not dispensed with, because ideas arise from and may reflect the material conditions within which social forces as classes exist (Hall 1986, 40). As Nicos Poulantzas (1973, 191) puts it, "the state is not a class instrument, but rather the state of a society divided into classes." Fourth, it is here, in the struggle over hegemony between different class fractions, that Gramsci attributed an important role to intellectuals. Thus, "Gramsci's investigation of the role of the intellectuals in modern society is part of his attempt to understand what actually links the world of production and civil or private society with the political realm" (Vacca 1982, 37). Gramsci under? stood intellectuals as exercising an ideological social function in a broad sense across the social, political, economic, and cultural fields in ways related to</page><page sequence="19">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 121 the class-structuring of societies. On one hand, traditional intellectuals are those who consider themselves to be autonomous (the itinerate condottiere}) but, more accurately, can be related to socio-economic structures belonging to a specific period of historical time. Examples would include 'ivory tower' intellectuals, who "can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as 'independent,' autonomous, endowed with a character of their own etc." (Gramsci 1971, 8). Traditional intellectuals therefore represent "the culture of a restricted intellectual aristocracy" that is "given by the man of letters, the philosopher, the artist" (Gramsci 1971, 9, 393). On the other hand, the category of organic intellectual was predominantly reserved for those intellec? tuals that stood as the mediators of hegemony articulated by social classes (see Sassoon 1987, 144, 214). Hence, according to Gramsci: Ever\r social group, coming into existence on the original terrain of an essential function in the world of economic production, creates together with itself, organically, one or more strata of intellectuals which give it homogeneity and an awareness of its own function not only in the economic but also in the social and political fields (Gramsci 1971, 5). Such intellectuals have the function of organizing the hegemony of social class forces, and thus capillary power, beyond the coercive apparatus of the state, whether as direct members of an intelligentsia, industrial technicians, intellectu? als of statecraft, specialists in political economy, organizers of "the 'confidence' of investors," journalists, or architects (Gramsci 1971, 5, 12; Gramsci 1995, 61 70; Gramsci 1996, 200-201).10 For Gramsci, organic intellectuals are engaged in active participation in everyday life, acting as agents or constructors, organizers and "permanent persuaders" in forming social class hegemony, or by perform? ing a valuable supporting role to subaltern groups engaged in promoting social change, that is then "'mediated' by the whole fabric of society" (Gramsci 1971, 12, 52-55). Thus, organic intellectuals do not simply produce ideas, they also concretize and articulate strategies in complex and often contradictory ways, which is possible because of their proximity to the most powerful forces in soci? ety. It is their task to develop the "gastric juices" to digest competing concep? tions of social order in conformity with a hegemonic project (Gramsci 1971, 128n.6). Put differently, it is their social function to transcend the particular interests of their own social group which brings "the interests of the leading class into harmony with those of subordinate classes and incorporates these other interests into an ideology expressed in universal terms" (Cox 1983, 168). When ideas are thus accepted as common sense?or "diffuse, unco-ordinated features of a generic mode of thought" (Gramsci 1971, 330)?they become natu? ralized in the form of intersubjective meanings. Accordingly, it is in this manner that ideas establish the wider frameworks of thought, "which condition the way individuals and groups are able to understand their social situation and the pos? sibilities of social change" (Gill and Law 1988, 74). It is through this process that the material structure of ideas plays a decisive role in shaping the terrain of class (-relevant) struggle. What this amounts to is a conception of the "necessary reciprocity" between ideas and material social conditions, in sustaining and possibly transforming state-civil society relations (Gramsci 1971, 12, 366). It is a focus that links the social function of intellectuals to the world of production within capitalist society, without succumbing to economism, whilst still offering the basis for a "Intellectuals of statecraft" refers to "a whole community of state bureaucrats, leaders, foreign policy experts, and advisors throughout the world who comment upon, influence, and conduct the activities of statecraft" (? Tuathail and Agnew 1992, 193).</page><page sequence="20">122 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE materialist and social class analysis of intellectuals. Cultural aspects, from litera? ture to architecture, clearly play a significant role within this conception of organic intellectuals where each activity is understood as a material social prod? uct having a social function endowed with political significance. The task there? fore becomes one of revealing the social functions of organic intellectuals as representative of class fractions within the complex web of relations between rul? ers and ruled (Morton 2003, 29-33). In sum, this mode of enquiry allows us to understand why certain ideas attain the presence of 'common sense' in the form of intersubjective meanings and not others. This account of historical materialism helps to avoid, first, the pitfalls of economism, regarding ideas merely as a reflection of a material structure, and, second, the problems of constructivism, regarding ideas as an equal explanatory factor alongside material social conditions. The opposition to poststructuralism has to be cast in a slightly different manner. There is the view that although there may well be a non-discursive realm of material reality, this can only be understood within categories that are constituted through discourse. This posi? tion is most clearly pronounced in the work of Laclau and Mouffe (2001, 108 original emphasis): The fact that every object is constituted as an object of discourse has nothing to do with whether there is a world external to thought, or with the realism/ideal? ism opposition... What is denied is not that... objects exist externally to thought, but the rather different assertion that they could constitute themselves as objects outside of any discursive condition of emergence. In such a formulation, hegemony becomes rendered as a constant interplay between autonomous and indeterminate discourses rather than linked to specific social interests and class identities. This results in abstracting forms of collective agency from the prevailing social order and isolating and separating issues from social conditions and material interests (Wood 1986, 176). To recap, the deficits of poststructuralism revolve around a failure to grasp the conditions of inequality and exploitation that confront social forces. The point that peoples' identities are constituted within the context of existing social relations, which are to some extent inherited from and shaped by historical relations of force, is largely ignored. Questions attempting to ascertain what aspects of social experience make possible the articulation of certain discourses, within the struggle over hege? mony, are thus suppressed. Discourse does not simply act upon people; rather, people act through discourse, so the world cannot be reduced to discourse alone. As Stuart Hall (1997, 31) puts it, "everything is within the discursive, but nothing is only discourse or only discursive." Conclusion: The Effects of Hegemony Antonio Gramsci elaborated a distinct theory of history within which ideology was understood in "its highest sense of a conception of the world that is implic? itly manifest in art, in law, in economic activity and in all manifestations of indi? vidual and collective life" (Gramsci 1971, 328). For Gramsci, idealist intellectuals developed a subjective account of history based on the progression of philosoph? ical thought rather than historically specific conditions of class struggle. This resulted in a hypostatizing of hegemony, removing social conflict from a quite specific context and treating it as an independent property divorced from any social basis so that "history becomes a formal history, a history of concepts" (Gramsci 1995, 338, 343-344, 370). Akin to the separation of ideas from material conditions within social constructivism, these solipsistic tendencies can also be similarly linked to the deficits of poststructuralism. It has been argued that a</page><page sequence="21">Andreas Bieler and Adam David Morton 123 discursive approach to politics possesses an aversion to locating representations in the context of political economy, or at worst is a very conscious attempt to eviscerate the enterprise of political economy (Campbell 1998, 219; Laffey 2000, 436). This results in the suppression of agency linked to class power and political economy so that the overriding economic significance of the promotion of cer? tain discourses, in favor of particular interests and purposes, is missed. Accord? ingly: Questions of identity may insinuate their way into all forms of politics but all forms of politics are not about questions of identity. Preoccupation with the poli? tics of identity can create a history without materialism, a history without eco? nomic exploitation, capital accumulation and power applied for the instrumental purposes of economic gain (O Tuathail 1996, 652). As Dirlik makes clear, the implications of such a strategy to the social sci? ences more broadly are significant. Poststructuralism might well then be "appealing because it disguises the power relations that shape a seemingly shapeless world and contributes to a conceptualization of that world that both consolidates and subverts possibilities of resistance" (Dirlik 1994, 355-356). By contrast, the position that ideas are material, a process of articulation within which signs themselves become part of a socially created world, can be sub? sumed differently within an historical materialist theory of history. What is denied here is not that objects are constituted through discourse; instead the rather different assertion is made that this is itself a material social practice: a practical activity developed through means of social production and reproduc? tion as a material relation. Emphasizing this rather different position thus entails realizing the production of meaning and ideas as part of material social processes, so that consciousness and thought are necessarily social material activities. An historical materialist theory of history thus throws into relief cer? tain features necessary to understanding the dual process of knowing and being known embedded within the production of ideas. But it does so by expressing textuality in terms of class struggle or specific conflictual social rela? tionships. For "the philosophy of praxis conceives the reality of human rela? tionships of knowledge as an element of political 'hegemony,'" linked to the agency of social classes (Gramsci 1995, 306). In sum, a historical materialist conceptualization of the role of ideas through its philosophy of internal rela? tions overcomes the shortcomings of constructivist and poststructuralist approaches. Social class forces are identified as core collective actors through a focus on the social relations of production. By acknowledging the location of these actors within the social relations of production, that is, the underlying power structure, it is then possible to address the question as to why a certain set of ideas, rooted within these material relations, dominates at a particular point in time. At the same time, revealing the effects of hegemony through a focus on the objectivations of subjective processes and meanings, by which the social world is constructed, is never a clear-cut process. This means that our "understandings of social power relations which abstract from the social organization of production must be radically incomplete" (Rupert 2003, 184). This notwithstanding, it is through our specific conception of hegemony that culture is not conceived as separate and then added to the socio-economic realm. Rather, the stress is on political economy as cultural. As Gramsci (1971, 360), rather soberly, reminds us, "that the objective possibilities exist for people not to die of hunger and that people do die of hunger, has its importance, or so one would have thought" whilst indicating at the same that "the existence of objective conditions... is not yet enough: it is necessary to 'know' them, and know how to use them." As we</page><page sequence="22">124 The Deficits of Discourse in IPE have argued, this is far removed from any tendencies of economism. But it is a view that reappraises different modes of cultural struggle as a "critique of capi? talist civilization" (Gramsci 1977, 10-13). By outlining the above epistemological philosophy of internal relations that marks a historical materialist theory of his? tory, a thorough challenge to the mainstream can then be enabled, which has been long implied by the ontological assumptions within critical IPE (Smith 2004, 505). To conclude, citing Georg Luk?cs (1971, 168), if "history is the his? tory of the unceasing overthrow of the objective forms that shape the life of man," then the deficits of discourse revolve around an inability to disclose antag? onistic identities embedded in the very processes of economic exploitation, leav? ing one to surmize whether poststructuralism actively seeks to erase such features as a viable focus in the first place.
