<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Inheritance of the Dead: Mortuary Rituals among the Chinese in Singapore Tong Chee Kiong Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore Introduction One of the most striking features about Chinese death rituals in Singapore is the astronomical sum of money spent to ensure their performance. It is not uncommon for families to spend the equivalent of $20,000 to $30,000 to enact these rituals. The average family spends between $10,000 and $20,000. Even poorer Chinese families desire and attempt to make the death rituals as elaborate as possible. The Chinese in general, including the immigrant Chinese in Southeast Asia, are generally perceived to be a very pragmatic people, especially regarding economic matters. Why, then, would they spend so much money to ensure the proper enactment of rituals? How do we account for the belief, even among people who clearly do not have sufficient resources, that death rituals must be as elaborate and ostentatious as possible? The Chinese in Singapore prepare for death long before its arrival is imminent. It is not unusual for Chinese, even those in their twenties and thirties, to subscribe to mutual aid associations to ensure adequate funding for and participation in their death rituals. Many set aside small amounts of money every month for this purpose. Many also pay a deposit to reserve a place in a Mahayana Buddhist temple to house their ancestral tablets. Known as chang sheng lu wei, or "long-life tablets" these look exactly like normal ancestral tablets except that they are covered with pieces of red cloth that will be removed upon a person's death. Similarly, graveyard plots are purchased long before death. What is the rationale for this seeming preoccupation with death, especially when we consider that one of the most highly valued elements in Chinese society is the hope for a long and prosperous life? Singapore society has been undergoing a rapid process of modernization and industrialization, particularly since World War II, which has vastly changed the physical and sociocultural milieu of the Chinese. These changes must have necessitated adaptations in the practice of death rituals. What are these changes and how do they affect the "traditional" perception of death rituals? There is clear evidence that despite modernization, elaborate death rituals are still seen as necessities. How do we account for their permanence and strength in an increasingly industrialized, technologically oriented society? This paper seeks to answer these and other questions, by examining the material and ideal interests of the different individuals and groups involved in the enactment of Chinese death rituals in Singapore. It must be noted that death, to the Chinese, is inevitable but not final. It is merely a point of transition and does not signify the end of a person's participation in the lives and activities of his family, nor of their involvement with him. Indeed, ancestors are not to be considered as persons apart 730</page><page sequence="2">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 131 from life but given crucial roles in the life of the living. This notion of mutual interdependence between the dead and the living reinforces the importance of the rituals because each depends on the other for emotional, social and economic security. Ancestors depend on the descendants for food, shelter, and money; the family, in turn, requires the assistance of the ancestors to deal with the problems of daily life. A process of continual exchange takes place. This perception is clearly seen in the instrumental quality of the death rituals, from the nature of the bai, the rituals associated with the funeral, the final burial, to the worship of the deceased as an ancestor. A central thrust of this paper is to show that the rituals associated with death involve the transformation of the dead into a "property-owning" spirit, because the Chinese believe that a person without property cannot conceivably become an ancestor. In return, the deceased reciprocates with gifts of luck, wealth, good health, long life and general well-being for the family. Death rituals accelerate the process of exchange, allowing the descendants to inherit the property of the deceased, to transfer his authority, and to acquire his status. But, it will also become clear that it is not simply the inheritance of the property the deceased possesses at death but also the potential for greater benefits that motivates the descendants to hold elaborate rituals and spend large sums of money. By converting the deceased from a "hungry ghost" into a rich ancestor, the now well-off ancestor will see fit and is in fact expected to reciprocate with even greater countergifts and benefits to the descendants. I will show that death rituals are important because they allow the ritual participants to tap the powers and resources of the dead. An analysis of the treatment of the soul and bone-remains of the dead will illustrate this point. The death rituals This section presents an analytical narrative of the funeral rituals of the Chinese in Singapore, giving an account of both form and process. The meaning of each stage of the ritual will also be discussed. This description begins with the preparation for death, followed by the treatment of the corpse, the daily rituals conducted at the funeral, the important final night rituals and finally the burial. It will also examine the popular practice in Singapore of cremating the dead. The purpose of the chapter is to present a coherent picture of the different death rituals and procedures, but it must be kept in mind that there is no single way of performing and interpreting the rituals. Variations can be observed. For reasons of coherence and clarity, I will describe a single funeral which I observed and in which I participated. Given the range of rituals involved in a Chinese funeral, I shall not attempt to discuss all the rituals but rather to concentrate on those that relate to inheritance and the transfer of property. Preparation for death Among the Chinese, preparation for death begins a few years before a person is on his deathbed. The ancient Chinese Book of Rites instructs men, "After attaining sixty years of age, the coffin should be inspected once a year, after seventy once a season, after eighty, once a month and after ninety, everyday" (see Comber, 1954:7).1 It is not</page><page sequence="3">132 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science unusual for Chinese aged over fifty to subscribe to mutual aid or clan associations to ensure that there will be enough money to perform his death rituals as well as to ensure a good turnout of people at his funeral. One informant said, "I have to at least make sure that I have a coffin to be buried in." Another said he wanted an elaborate funeral because it would show that he had lived a good life. Another informant said he had already purchased his coffin: "It is a very good coffin, made of wood specially imported from China. It is guaranteed not to rot for a hundred years." Many Chinese in Singapore reserve a place in a clan ancestral hall or a Mahayana Buddhist temple to accommodate their ancestral tablets. A popular reason given for this action is the desire for a choice or propitious spot in the temple because "this will ensure that the person will have a comfortable life in the Otherworld". Graveyard plots, like temple spaces, are purchased long before death. Plots with good fengshui are very popular, command high prices and are snapped up very quickly. At the deathbed When a person is near death, all the family members — sons, grandsons, daughters, and daughters-in-law — are summoned and gathered around the bedside to await his death. It is considered an unfilial act not to be present at the deathbed of one's parent. People travel long distances, and sons who are overseas are expected to make the trip home. On the deathbed, last words are exchanged between the dying and his descendants. Final instructions by the dying with regard to the funeral rituals are also communicated. In one case, red packets were distributed by the dying person to all his sons containing the final instructions regarding the division of the property. Menstruating women are not allowed near the dying for fear of polluting him. Pregnant women are also not permitted near the dying because the spirit might enter the embryo and possess the unborn child. In preparation for the funeral rituals, the main living room is cleared of all furniture and household items because anything that comes into contact with death is thought to be polluted and would then have to be disposed of by burning. The s hen zuo or "god altar" and the ancestral tablets are draped with red cloth. According to informants, the gods and ancestors cannot come into contact with or even see the dead because he is considered to be dirty and dangerous and they would be insulted if they were to be so exposed. At the moment of death, the family bursts out into loud wailing and crying. Sons implore the father's soul not to leave them and to come back into the body. After an appropriate interval, the crying quiets down. Sons carry the body of the deceased and lay it on a previously prepared spot in the centre of the living room. A red blanket is placed over the body, completely covering it. This blanket is called fen bu, or "the division". According to one religious specialist, the blanket signifies the division between heaven and earth, for at the moment "the deceased is still on earth as he has not yet been properly prepared for the journey to heaven". At the same time, another piece of cloth is hung over the front door. This cloth, according to an informant, serves three functions: "It prevents malicious spirits from entering the house, and at the same time, prevents the soul of the deceased from wandering out of the home. This will protect innocent bystanders from harm. Finally, it informs the community</page><page sequence="4">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 133 that a death has occurred in the family. They can then take appropriate measures to ward off the dirty effects of death." Word is sent out to inform kin and friends of the death in the family. A lighted joss-stick in a red urn and three food items are placed near the head of the deceased by the eldest son, who kneels before the corpse and makes three ritual bai. The body is then prepared for the "washing and dressing" rituals. Traditionally, the water for washing the dead must be purchased from the gods. As noted by Leon Comber, "Sons and grandsons leave the house in a body and walk silently with their heads lowered in grief to the nearest well, stream or river, preceded by the eldest son carrying a bucket. After solemnly filling the bucket with water, it is the practice for a few copper coins to be thrown into the water to pay its guardian spirit. The practice is known as 'buying the water'" (Comber, 1954:13). Nowadays, it is more common for tap water to be used instead of water from the river, but this does not change the aim of the rituals. However, water from the home of the deceased cannot be used in the washing ritual. According to one ritual specialist, "Death causes everything in the home to be dirty, including the water. It would be ridiculous to use dirty water to clean the dead." Some informants maintain that the water must be scented with pomegranate flower to increase its cleansing potency. This water is called tian shui "heavenly water". The eldest son and eldest-daughter-in-law perform the actual ritual of washing the dead.2 According to informants, this ritual is very important because "a person with an unclean body will be despised and punished in Hell". The very act of dying makes the deceased dirty and he must therefore be cleansed. This ritual purifies the dead and prepares him for his journey through Hell, and his final passage to Heaven. After the ritual bath, the deceased is dressed in many layers of clothing. In the past, the dead were traditionally dressed in full regalia: "In monarchical days in China, the shou i or burial robes were most elaborate and if the deceased held an official rank, then he was dressed in the full regalia of his rank. Sometimes as many as twenty robes were made" (Comber, 1954:11). At least seven to nine layers of clothing are needed, to "ensure that the deceased will have adequate clothing for all the seasons in Heaven". The clothes are lavish and elaborate "to give the impression that the deceased was an important person in this world, thus ensuring good treatment in his passage through Hell". These clothes are known as shou yi or "generational clothes". According to informants, each layer represents a generation of the deceased's descendants; the more layers he has on, the more his descendants, and the greater the indication that he has led a good life. Pearls are placed in the mouth and hands of the deceased. According to the son of the deceased, pearls have preservative qualities to protect the body of the deceased. They can also be used to bribe the "judges in Hell". After washing and dressing the deceased, the family performs the ru mu, literally, "entering the wood" ritual. The body of the deceased is placed in the coffin. It is important to make the coffin as comfortable as possible for the deceased. Some personal articles of the deceased are placed in the coffin, such as his toothbrush, comb, spectacles, and even his favourite pillow. It is said that the deceased will continue to make use of them in the Otherworld. A mirror, "to light the way for the deceased", and a bag of grains, "to ensure that the deceased always have enough to eat",3 are likewise placed inside the coffin. A large amount of joss-paper and paper money is also included for the deceased's use in the Otherworld. Precautions are</page><page sequence="5">134 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science taken to prevent the entry of foreign objects into the coffin, such as metallic and sharp objects that can hurt the deceased and insects that can destroy the body. After the body of the deceased has been properly arranged in the coffin, the sons, led by the eldest, take a spoonful of rice and symbolically feed the deceased. This feeding of the dead is important because a person will become a hungry ghost if he is not fed. The family gathers round the coffin for one last moment with the deceased, at which time some of the family members will bend over the coffin to whisper into the ears of the corpse. According to one informant, they are saying hao hua, literally "good words" to the deceased to comfort his soul. It is also a final attempt to communicate with the deceased before the coffin is sealed. The coffin is then nailed shut, a nail in each corner. After the four nails have been hammered in, a fifth one called the zi-sun-ding, or "posterity nail", is placed at the centre of the coffin by the eldest son. It signifies that although the person is dead, he will have many generations of descendants who will worship him.4 Small pieces of red paper are stuck to the seams of the coffin for "warding off evil spirits that might try to enter". The coffin is then carried out of the home and placed under the canopy.5 An altar is set up upon which is placed an elaborate offering of food. The eldest son then kneels before the altar and, holding a lighted joss-stick in his hands, he bows three times. At the same time, he implores the spirit of the dead father to partake of the food placed on the altar. After he has completed this ritual, each family member, in order of seniority, performs the same act. Ritual paraphernalia for the funeral A red sheet of paper containing vital information about the deceased is posted at the site of the funeral. It informs people and presumably the gods of the birthdate and deathdate of the deceased, the number of wives; and other information. Small pieces of red paper are also placed at strategic locations along the route from the home of the deceased to the funeral site. These are meant to protect people who inadvertently come into contact with death as well as to protect them from harm by the deceased. People who live near the site of the funeral will take a variety of measures to avoid coming into contact with death. They will take long detours to avoid being near death. According to one person, "The funeral is a place of death and there are many spirits lurking around. It is best not to go near." Families who live near the funeral site will place red charms on their doors to ensure that the spirits will not come into their homes. At the north side of the canopy the coffin is placed on two tripods in a horizontal position. An urn, covered with a bamboo fan, is arranged under the coffin. This is called the yao hu, literally, "the pot for boiling herbs". Beside the coffin is an elaborate paper lantern known as the zhi deng long is readied. It is carried by the eldest son during the performance of the funeral rituals. In front of the coffin is a chair with the character hun or "soul" written on it. The deceased's clothing and shoes are placed over the chair. A large picture of the deceased known as the "longevity portrait", is also set on the chair (see Plate I). Informants insist that this is not merely just a symbolic representation, and that the deceased is spiritually present and seated in the chair.</page><page sequence="6">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 135 Plate 1. The coffin lying under the canopy during the wake period. Flanking the longevity portrait are two figurines, servants who will accompany the deceased on his journey. As one son of the deceased explained, "The servants will ensure that my father will have a comfortable life. He will not even have to lift a finger to do anything." In real life, only the rich can afford to have servants in their homes. Servants are not found in homes of poor families. The provision of servants for the deceased signifies the elevation of his status. An altar with two candles is placed in front of the chair. Between the candles is placed a red joss-urn which must always contain lighted joss-stick. The candles must remain lit throughout the funeral. According to some informants, the light allows the deceased to see in the dark. Others responded that the candles represent the continuous worship of the deceased, assuring that he will always be cared for and remembered. The back portion of the coffin is hidden from view by a screen. The screen depicts the 24 acts of supreme filial piety found in traditional Chinese classics. This makes public the family's tradition and serves as a reminder to the family members, especially the descendants of the deceased. A straw mat is placed beside the coffin. There is also a tin for burning joss-paper. Banners and wreaths sent by friends are hung all around the funeral site. The number of banners and wreaths is usually taken as an indication of the social status of the deceased and his descendants. Under the canopy are many tables and chairs. Plates of titbits, such as groundnuts and watermelon seeds are placed on the tables for the guests' consumption. At the side of the canopy is placed a table where the treasurer collects contributions for the funeral.</page><page sequence="7">136 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science Daily rituals at the funeral Funerals in Singapore normally last from three to seven days, the number of days being always in odd numbers, such as three, five or seven. Routine rituals are carried out daily throughout this period. After the initial sacrifices, routine food offerings are made to the deceased in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. At these times, the eldest son, carrying a lighted joss-stick in his hands, bows three times and invites his deceased father to eat the daily meals. The implication is that these are the father's normal mealtimes, and that even though he is now dead he continues to have the same needs as before. The idea of the living presence of the deceased can be observed in the ritual of placing his favourite food on the altar. In one case, a daughter of the deceased placed a lighted cigarette in the joss-urn. She said, "My father always smoked a cigarette after his meals." She insisted on getting her father's favourite brand of cigarettes. Beside the coffin, family members, usually females, burn joss-paper as a sacrifice to the deceased. This must be done slowly to ensure that the deceased gets all the money that is due to him. Unburned or partially burned joss-paper, it is believed, cannot be used by the dead. It is believed that this ritual must be performed continuously, "to assure the deceased that he is being cared for by his filial descendants". In one case, a female member of the family who was given the task of carrying out this ritual was errant, and she was severely reprimanded by the eldest son for being lazy and unfilial. The bu yao or "boiling herbs" ritual is also carried out daily. Each morning, the eldest son or eldest daughter-in-law kneels beside the coffin. Using a bamboo fan, he fans the yao hu and ritually repeats the words, "When I was young, you took care of me. When I was sick, you fed me medicine. Now that you are sick, I will take care of you, prepare herbs to feed you so that you will get well soon." Toward evening, a large number of friends of the family attend the funeral. On arrival, they bow or kneel before the altar. With single lighted joss-stick in hand, they perform the ritual bai, prostrating themselves or bowing three times to the deceased. A few family members will kneel beside the coffin and accompany the visitors in the ritual bai. This is very important. A visitor will be insulted if there is no one to accompany him in the bai because this indicates a "loss of face". After this ritual, they settle down and chat with each other. Family members make a point to go round to exchange words with the visitors. Visitors will invariably make a trip to the treasurer's table to give a small contribution toward meeting the cost of the funeral. This must be done discreetly, however, and the money must be hidden from public view. Moreover, the contribution is not called "money". Instead, it is referred to as a gift. Very few young children except family members are found at the site of the funeral. One informant ascribed this to the belief that young children are more vulnerable to attacks by evil spirits, therefore their presence at funerals is not encouraged. Pregnant women and newlywed couples are also not allowed to attend. Two reasons were given by the informant for these taboos. First, since funerals are associated with death, the vicinity of the funeral is potentially dangerous to all the living. Second, it is believed that many evil spirits are attracted to the area surrounding the funeral. These uninvited spirits also pose a danger to the living, particularly to weaker women and children.6 Strangers and visitors regard the deceased with fear and dread because the</page><page sequence="8">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 137 corpse is thought to be inherently dangerous. Precautions must be taken to protect guests from harm by the deceased, who during this transitory period between being a dead person and an ancestor is not easily controllable. Thus, each visitor is given a piece of red thread to protect against evil influences and to ensure that the visitor will have a safe journey home. Visitors are never "seen off". They leave quietly, without saying goodbye to the deceased's family. Words like "please come again" are never used because they can be taken to mean to invite death again. According to informants, visitors must wash their faces and take a bath with pomegranate water upon reaching home to ensure eradication of the contamination of death, and to allay the fear of having taken on the "dirt" of death by virtue of being near the dead. An overnight vigil is kept at the funeral out of mourners' fear that something unnatural could happen to the corpse if the coffin is left unattended. Informants mentioned that it is generally believed that if a black cat jumped over the coffin the corpse of the deceased will reanimate and become a "walking zombie". Another reason cited for the overnight vigil is to provide companionship for the deceased. As one son said, "As a filial son, I must watch over the body of the dead father, to protect him from evil influences." Mourning clothes Throughout the funeral, the family members wear very simple mourning clothes, consisting of a black or white blouse and trousers. No "loud" colours such as red or yellow are permitted. On the final night of the funeral, however, the family of the deceased puts on very elaborate mourning clothes. Five grades of mourning garments are found. The first-order mourners, that is sons, eldest grandson, daughters, and daughters-in-law, wear the coarsest clothes, consisting of white shirts and trousers, straw overcoats, hats and slippers (see Plate 2). The second-order mourners, that is Plate 2. First-order mourners lead the procession round the canopy, followed by second-, third- and fourth-order mourners in their respective mourning garments.</page><page sequence="9">138 • Southeast Asian journal of Social Science the deceased's sons-in-law, wear white mourning clothes without the coarse overalls.7 The third-order mourners, consisting of the deceased's brothers and sisters, wear black mourning clothes. The deceased's daughter's children are the fourth-order mourners. They wear blue mourning garments, with blue caps (for the males) and shrouds (for the females) and blue sashes. The sash in all funeral garments must not be tied in a knot, but just tucked into the garment. This is especially critical for the clothes worn by the deceased. A tied garment, I was told, "will cause the deceased to be trapped, and unable to complete his journey". The fifth-order mourners, the great grandchildren, wear green mourning clothes, with green caps and sashes. Mourning pins or xiao are worn from the first day of the funeral. These are small pieces of cloth, about one and a half inches by one inch, which are pinned on the shirt sleeves. The grades of xiao generally correspond with the order of the mourning garments. The final night funeral rituals The final night of the funeral holds the greatest ritual significance. An elaborate altar is constructed at the south end of the canopy. This is called the shen zuo or "altar to the gods", in contrast to the altar for the deceased (see Plate 3). Behind the shen zuo are pictures of several gods.8 Beside the altar are two lanterns, with the age of the 8iiHl • 1' , „| ,i I* j!i * if! • ii! 151 ! f • &lt;9$ r ts* J !

According to my informants, three years are normally added to the actual age of the deceased, to show that he has lived a long and prosperous life.</page><page sequence="10">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 139 The funeral service normally begins at six o'clock in the evening. Three priests, dressed in white robes, stand at the shen zno and chant prayers. A group of musicians play accompaniment to the chants. After about half an hour of chanting, the chief priest takes a papiermache donkey and sets it on fire. Pasted on the back of the donkey is a piece of red paper, inscribed with the deceased's name, birthdate and deathdate. According to the priest, the donkey is being sent to heaven to inform the gods that funeral rituals are being conducted for the deceased. The priests proceed with their chanting. Half an hour later, a pair of feng huang or phoenix are burned. These birds are sent to heaven to invite the gods to descend to earth and attend the funeral rituals. Two more pairs of phoenix are burned to ensure that all the gods have been invited and that no god has been slighted. After this, the family members begin to assemble in a line before the altar. The line is staggered according to the order of relationship to the deceased, with the eldest son first, followed by the other sons, grandsons, daughters-in-law, daughters, and so on. In one case, the eldest son was too old and weak to participate in the rituals, and the eldest grandson stood in his place. The eldest son carries a red joss-urn with a single lighted joss-stick. It is believed that the soul of the deceased resides in the joss-urn. It was stressed that this is not just a symbolic representation, but that the deceased's soul is physically present in the urn. Over his shoulder, the eldest son also carries the zhi deng long, which is to light the way for the deceased. Each family member also carries a joss-stick. Led by the chief priest, the procession walks around the canopy seven times. This ritual is known as the wang xi fang literally, "walking in the westerly direction". This ritual, according to one ritual specialist, performs the function of accompanying and aiding the soul of the deceased in his journey to bliss, located in xi tian or "Western Heaven". n V' • V Plate 4. Family members, lead by the priest, perform the "crossing of the bridges" ritual over the nai he qiao.</page><page sequence="11">140 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science After this ritual is completed, the family settles down before the shen zuo while the priests chant more prayers for another half hour. The family then reassembles to perform the "crossing of the bridges" ritual. A wooden bridge is placed at the centre of the canopy. This is the nai he cjiao, literally, "The Bridge of No Return", or "The Bridge of Sighs" (see Plate 4). The priest leads the procession over the bridge. Thirteen crossings are made, signifying the thirteen bridges that lead to the "Gates of Hell". At each crossing, coins meant to appease dangerous spirits present on the deceased's hazardous journey to Hell are thrown into a bowl placed under the bridge. It is the duty of all family members to accompany the deceased on this journey. On the thirteenth crossing, the soul is believed to be about to enter Hell. At this juncture, family members break out into loud wailing. They bid a final farewell to the deceased, wishing him a smooth journey. The ten courts of hell After the crossings have been completed, the family kneels before the altar while the priests continue to chant more prayers. This is considered to be a very dangerous period because it is believed that the soul of the deceased is now making his way through the "Ten Courts of Hell". Among the Chinese in Singapore, it is believed that upon death the deceased has to go through the Ten Courts of Hell, or more precisely, ten di yu or "earthly prisons". In each court the deceased stands before a presiding magistrate who tries him based on his actions and deeds on earth. There are sets of mandatory punishments for specific crimes and wrongdoings. For example, in the second court, ignorant doctors who mutilate people are sliced up like butchered animals. In the third court, dishonest mandarins, forgers, slanderers, and those who sell the family burial grounds are punished by having their knees pulverized, their hearts and eyes torn out and their feet and hands cut off. The miserly rich, swindlers, and dishonest merchants are kept in the fourth court. Here, they are forced to remain seated on a bed of nails and then crushed under wooden beams. Murderers, rapists, and prostitutes are punished by having their chests opened and their hearts plucked out and fed to animals. Sacrilegious persons are crushed by rollers or flayed alive and stuffed. Unfilial sons have their tongues cut out and nails driven into their head.9 Finally, the deceased reaches the tenth Court of Hell, or the Court of Reincarnation.10 Here, the judge decides, based on a person's deeds on earth, whether he should be reborn as an animal or man, also what his new status in life will be. At this juncture of the funeral, an elaborately decorated pagoda known as the zhuan lun or the "wheel of reincarnation" is hung from the roof of the canopy. With the family of the deceased kneeling before the pagoda, the priest reads a report (to the gods) about the deceased: his name, address, age, sex, number of wives and children, and occupation. After reading the report, he twirls the pagoda, and it spins round and round. As it spins, the priest continues to chant prayers. The point where the pagoda comes to a stop, according to the priest, is the person or animal into which the deceased will be reincarnated.11 A large amount of goods are then sacrificed to the deceased. It is the duty of the descendants to ensure that the deceased is adequately and even luxuriously provided for in the Otherworld to ensure his happiness, and in turn, bring blessings to the family. Everything that the deceased could possibly need</page><page sequence="12">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore *2 41 will be burned as a sacrifice, including toothbrushes, shoes, clothes, blankets, and a large quantity of paper money. To prevent wandering spirits from stealing the sacrifices meant for the deceased, family members kneel in a circle around the fire and strike the ground with bamboo sticks, making a loud noise. Then final night rituals come to an end. The family settles down for one last overnight vigil and prepares for the deceased's burial. gigg ;!■ T' T :Jjg IK?

The burning of sacrifices to the deceased to ensure his provision in the after life includes a luxury car, servants and ample paper money. The burial Early the next morning a religious specialist arrives to perform the burial rituals. This specialist is usually not a Taoist or Buddhist priest but a layman regarded as knowledgeable in burial affairs. In one case the religious specialist was not adept at chanting prayers. To compensate, he took out a cassette tape of a previously recorded Buddhist chant and played it on the tape recorder. An elaborate offering is once more placed on the altar. This offering consist of a pig, chicken, duck, various sweetcakes and fruits, bowls of rice, and cups of wine. The eldest son kneels before the altar and offers each dish to the deceased. After a suitable interval, when it is felt that the deceased has eaten enough, the whole family kneels beside the altar while the visitors pay their last respects. Six volunteers then carry the coffin and place it on an elaborately decorated lorry. At this point, the family breaks into loud wailing. The coffin, it is important to stress, cannot be touched by anyone but the family members. It is believed that persons who inadvertently touch the coffin will be struck with ill fortune and even death. Thus volunteers who carry the coffin do so with pieces of red paper in their</page><page sequence="13">142 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science hands. It is interesting to note that although only family members are allowed to touch the coffin, they are not allowed to load the coffin onto the lorry. This can only be done by friends of the deceased or by professional helpers. The funeral procession is headed by one or more bands of musicians, dressed in military-style uniforms and playing discordant music. The noise is meant to frighten away any malicious spirits lurking around the funeral site. At the same time, it gives the funeral an air of festivity, or re nao. Behind the musicians are a number of people carrying blue banners inscribed with names of people who have given contributions toward the funeral. Some of the banners are inscribed with the names of the various clan organizations. The cortege then forms behind the lorry, with the sons and daughters in the first row, followed by other family members. Two long ropes are attached to the front of the lorry and friends of the deceased pull the cortege along. The eldest son kneels beside the road and bids farewell to the deceased. Although death is inevitable, family members must not be seen leading the deceased to the grave, which is why only friends are allowed to load the coffin into the lorry and drive the cortege to the graveyard, with the family following behind, pulling at the cortege as if to prevent the it from leaving. On arrival at the graveyard the coffin is lowered into the ground. This, too, is done by friends or professional helpers. According to informants, the coffin must be perfectly aligned with the gravestone because failure to do so will result in the inability of the soul of the deceased to receive the offerings made to him. Others engage a fengshui expert, or geomancer, to ensure that this is done correctly. In one case of a family that did not engage a. fengshui expert, the sons squabbled for almost an hour trying to decide the proper alignment for the coffin. After this is satisfactorily completed, a temporary altar is set up before the coffin. Here are placed a picture of the deceased, two lighted candles, a pair of joss-sticks, and a simple food offering. Again starting with the eldest son, and followed by the rest of the family, each prayerfully bids farewell to the body of the deceased. Finally, the ritual specialist throws a white cockerel across the grave in the direction of the chief mourner, who catches it. This act, according to one informant, ensures the perpetuation of descendants of the deceased. It can also be taken to mean the final passing of the rights of the deceased to his descendants. The family watches as professional gravediggers fill up the hole. The eldest son carries the picture of the deceased and the joss-urn. These will be placed on the family ancestral altar at home. From this moment on, the deceased is believed to be an ancestor and no longer a dead person, and the worship of the ancestor begins. Cremations Owing to the land shortage in Singapore, the government has increasingly advocated cremation as a means of disposal of the dead in preference to graveyard burials. Priority is given to the use of land for urban development and housing, and this has led to a sharp decrease in the land available for graveyards. Thus burial plots are very expensive, and their acquisition involves a tedious process to obtain special dispensation from the government. As a result, cremation is often chosen as an alternative to burial. Except for the process of burning instead of burying, the rituals are similar. On arrival at the crematorium, the coffin is set on a tripod before an altar.</page><page sequence="14">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese hi Singapore • J 43 Most crematoria in Singapore are run by Buddhist temples. Buddhist monks chant prayers for the dead and then lead the family round the coffin three times, after which the coffin is pushed into an enclosed propane burner. On the following day, the family members return to the crematorium to collect the bones of the deceased. The bones and ashes are spread on a tray, and using chopsticks, family members carefully pick up the small pieces of bones and place them in a joss-urn. With the priest leading the family, the urn is carried and placed in the columbarium. Bones and souls: death and inheritance In his classic work, The Gift, Mauss suggests that the giving of a gift institutes an obligation to receive and to reciprocate the initial gift: "Prestations which are in theory voluntary, disinterested and spontaneous are in fact obligated and interested. The form often taken is that of a gift generously offered, but the accompanying behaviour is formal pretence and social deception while the transaction itself is based on obligation and economic self-interest." (1967:1) More recently, Bourdieu advances the idea of "symbolic capital", in which the giving of a gift and the projected countergift has the "effect of transforming into mechanical sequences of obligatory acts the at once risky and necessary improvisation of the everyday strategies which owe their infinite complexity to the fact that the giver's undeclared calculation must reckon with the receiver's undeclared calculation, and hence satisfy his expectations without appearing to know what they are". (1977:171) Similarly, death for the Chinese provides an arena for the acceleration of exchange, both between the living and the dead, and between the family and the community. Gifts, in the form of property, wealth, authority, status and power are transacted. Through an analysis of the symbols invoked during ritual enactment, particularly with respect to the treatment of the soul and bones, these exchange processes will be illuminated. Before proceeding to do so, however, it is useful to examine the nature of Chinese ancestor beliefs. Pervasive influence of ancestors Ancestors play important roles in every aspect of Chinese life. They are present at the three most important life events of a Chinese; his birth, marriage and death. Daily sacrifices at the family altar remind the descendants of the omnipresence of their ancestors. At all important familial events, such as embarking on a long journey, starting a new business, or choosing a marriage partner, the ancestors are consulted and their blessings requested. But the influence of ancestors is not limited to major life events. In fact, they are consulted even in the mundane affairs of life, from buying lottery tickets to determining the right time for spring-cleaning the home. Chinese ancestors are anthropomorphic. They are perceived to have the same needs and desires as their living descendants (Wee, 1977:18). This is illustrated by the variety of items sacrificed to the dead, including combs, cigarettes, and cars, in the belief that the ancestors will continue to use them in the Otherworld. Ancestors are conceived of as real, and their comfort equated with the comfort of the living</page><page sequence="15">144 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science descendants. For example, in one home a small potted plant was placed over the ancestral tablets. According to one informant, "The ancestral tablets are in a position where they are exposed to the afternoon sun. The plant gives shade and will make the ancestors feel more comfortable." The Chinese conceive of a close interdependence between the dead and the living. The worlds of living and the dead can be said to form a homologous whole. Ancestors depend on their descendants for the satisfaction of their daily needs, while the living, in turn, look to the dead for assistance in solving daily problems. The dead need the living to enact proper funeral rituals which ensure that they will not become hungry ghosts, while the living require aid to ensure success in human enterprises. There is, thus, a constant process of exchange. Even life is treated as a commodity, as in the case of a man who lived to the age of 93. Because the Chinese so value longevity, three years are generally added to the actual age at death, so in this instance, the death banner should have read that the man died at the age of 96. After prayers to the deceased, however, it was decided that because the man had lived such a long life, the three years should not be added, but instead saved for the benefit of his sons. The sense here is that life itself is a commodity that can be transacted, a gift from fathers to sons. Instrumental quality of death rituals Ritual performance for the Chinese, it can be argued, is egocentred (cf. Wee, 1977:22). An examination of what is sought from the ancestors during the rituals demonstrates this element of calculated self-interest. The items most commonly requested from the ancestors are wealth and prosperity. For example, during the worship of the dead, a typical prayer would go, "Dear ancestor, we are offering elaborate sacrifices of food and money as a gift to you. In return, bless us with good fortune and good health", or, "We are filial descendants who come yearly to clean your grave and offer sacrifices. Give us a lucky lottery number so that when we strike it rich, we will return next year to completely rebuild your grave". In fact, one of the most common sights at a graveyard is a woman kneeling before the gravestone, a small red can in her hand. Inside are ten slips of paper, numbered zero to nine. She shakes the can vigorously while pleading for a lucky number, until a slip drops out. Quickly she opens the slip, memorizes the number, puts it back in the can, and repeats the ritual four times. The four digit lucky number, believed to be a gift from the ancestor, is used for gambling. The sense is that the assistance of the ancestors can be sequestered to ensure success in social life. Another popular request has to do with the education of children. It is hoped that with the ancestors' help the children will do well in school. In one case, for example, a woman explained that her son was getting good grades in school because her grandfather, who had been a magistrate in China, was taking care of his descendants. The interests of the ancestor are also served; she claimed that her son's achievements brought pride and honour to the ancestor. She attributed her son's success to the fact that she has been faithful in making offerings to the ancestor. The third category of bai centres on the attainment of good health and long life. The bai by the descendants to the ancestors often sounds like a business transaction. It is also important to point out that the bai are often done in quiet whisper, which can be likened to a private conversation between the person and the ancestor. Thus, the</page><page sequence="16">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • Î 45 proper treatment of the dead, through the expenditure of great amounts of money for elaborate rituals, is tied to the belief that correct treatment will ensure a reciprocal response from the ancestors, and guarantee benefits for the ritual sponsors. Death and the inheritance of property Johnston, working in the Shantung Province, and Ahern, in Chi'nan, have both noted that a critical motivation for the continuation of ancestral rites is property inheritance. (Johnston, 1910:255; Ahern, 1973:161) Data from Singapore suggest that the inheritance of property is still very much a part of death ritual effectuation. In one case, for example, a man who was to enter the hospital for a major operation gathered all his sons to tell them that if he was to die, how he was to be buried and how the property was to be divided. Generally, property is only divided among the sons after the death of the father. There is a sense among the informants that to fen jia or "divide the household" before the father's death is not only an unfilial act, but also opens the family to ridicule from the community. Furthermore, there is the belief that property and wealth can only be divided after the completion of all the required rituals.12 "We cannot do it before father is properly buried," says one son, "He will be angry that we are so eager to grab his property before the cessation of mourning. Not only that, people will laugh at us and label us as unfilial sons, only interested in money." Thus, it is the very execution of the funeral rituals that give sons the right to appropriate the property of the deceased. Only after all the rituals are performed and the soul is safely transferred to the Otherworld does the deceased relinquish his rights to property. The end of the funeral signifies that the now benevolent spirit gladly gives his property to his descendants in repayment for their help in his difficult journey through Hell and his elevation to the status of ancestor. Obversely, failure to enact the proper rituals negates the right of descendants to inherit from the dead.13 To the Chinese, a person without a home, money, or food is considered to be a beggar. The same holds true for the world of spirits; a homeless and hungry spirit is considered to be a "hungry ghost" or beggar-spirit. This is the reason elaborate sacrifices are necessary. The giving of these gifts allows for the deceased's conversion from an unrefined hungry ghost into a property-owning spirit, as a person without property cannot conceivably become an ancestor. Thus throughout the funeral, great care is taken to ensure that the deceased is adequately fed and that he always has some money in his hands. The giving of property to the deceased can be viewed as "threshold gifts", marking the passage from one state to another. Gifts of food, money and houses are not merely to appease the ancestor, they are agents of transformation. In exchange, the descendants inherit the property of the deceased. The potential for more property The inheritance of the deceased's property, however, can only explain why sons have a vested interest in ensuring the performance of the rituals. It is insufficient to explain why daughters, sons-in-law, third- and fourth-order mourners take part in the rituals. In addition, it does not fully explicate why elaborate rituals are necessary for deceased mothers, who do not own property, at least not directly. Finally, it is observed that</page><page sequence="17">146 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science even the poor and those who do not leave any inheritance are given the benefit of a funeral and an ancestral tablet, thus guaranteeing their worship. Even for these people there is a desire to produce an elaborate funeral. I suggest that what is important is not simply the inheritance of the property of the deceased, but also the potential for greater benefits that motivate the descendants to spend so much money. It is believed that by converting the deceased into a rich ancestor, the now well-off ancestor will see fit, and is in fact expected, to return the favour and reward descendants with even more wealth. Thus, in one funeral that I attended, a relative said, "If we give more to the deceased by burning lots of money to him, then he will know that we are filial descendants who ensured that he has a luxurious life in the Otherworld. If he is living well, how can he bear to see his descendants, who are responsible for his comfort, living poorly." This is why so much effort is put into dressing up the dead to be more impressive than he actually was in this life. The clothes are lavish and elaborate, "to give the impression that the deceased was an important person, thus ensuring good treatment in his passage through Hell".14 The potential for reciprocal gains may explain why descendants compete with one another for the affections of the deceased during the funeral. By impressing the dead father with one's filiality and generosity, one hopes to increase the father's obligation to reciprocate. But the transfer and inheritance of property must be seen within the context of total transactions between the deceased and his descendants. Thus, even if very little remains to hand down by the time of the deceased's death, the fact is that the sons are indebted to their father for raising them. In other words, we must consider the exchanges that took place between the deceased and his children during the father's lifetime as well as after his death. One informant stated his obligation as follows: "When my parents were alive, I always give a part of my salary to them. That is the duty of a son. Why should it be any different now that they are dead?" The enactment of the funeral and the wearing of mourning garments can be viewed as a means of repaying a debt to the deceased. For example, a younger brother of the deceased said that he was participating in the funeral because his parents had died when he was still very young and his elder brother had taken care of him. Similarly, the words spoken at the bu yao ritual reinforce the idea of the funeral as a means of debt repayment. Descent entails a necessary obligation to worship the dead. But this is not simply because of the consanguinal or affinal ties to the deceased, but rather that descent implies a certain debt owed to the deceased by the descendants. The inheritance of the property of the dead increases the debt and obligation to propitiate the ancestor. This, however, does not only work in one direction. Because rituals are enacted on his behalf, the ancestor becomes indebted to the ritual sponsors and is obligated to repay the debt. The linkage between death rituals and economic motives can be seen in the preponderance of money symbols in the course of death ritual enactment. For example, family members continually burn joss-money to the deceased. The inside of the coffin is stuffed full of joss-paper. Joss-money is strewn all over the funeral site as well. The largest offering of money is carried out just prior to the burial, when a huge pile of joss-paper, sometimes several feet high, is burned. Indeed, at every important juncture in the death rituals, money is burned for the dead.</page><page sequence="18">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 347 There are several types of spirit money. The most common is jin zi, literally gold-paper. It is made from sheets of joss-paper with a small piece of gold-coloured paper pasted in the middle. The second type is call yin zi or silver paper. It looks like the jin zi except that it has a silver coloured piece of paper in the centre. Although spirit-money is made of paper, it is thought to replicate real gold and silver. This is demonstrated by the common practice of folding the joss-paper into intricate shapes resembling gold and silver ingots. Folding the paper, according to informants, increases the value of the money. The third type of spirit money is call "Hell banknotes". These look like real dollar bills except that they come in very large denominations of ten thousand dollars. Money burnt to the dead is seen as real and not simply symbolic representations. The spirit money is said to be actually used as legal tender in the Otherworld. This view was shared by the Chinese in nineteenth-century Amoy: It would be a great mistake to suppose that sending mock articles of paper to the next world through the agency of flames was ever considered in Chinese as only an expression of the goodwill of the survivors to enrich the dead on yonder side of the grave. Numerous exhortations, addressed to the people in sundry books, never to neglect such sacrifices because they really do enrich the dead, point unmistakably to the contrary. (DeGroot, 1892:11/719) Thus the dead are believed to actually benefit from the sacrifices. For instance, another common type of joss-paper, yellow "chant paper", is often burned. It is believed that since priests had chanted prayers over the paper, ancestors will hear the prayers when the paper is burned. According to informants, the burning of spirit money is important because it ensures the comfort and wealth of the ancestors. Fire acts as the agent of transformation. Burning transforms the money into something valuable. Partially burned money cannot be utilized. Rituals are conducted to ensure that the ancestors receive the sacrifices, that the money has not been stolen by other spirits. Money is also important because it paves the deceased's way into the Otherworld. It can be used to bribe the "judges of Hell" to ensure a smooth journey. Similarly, in the nai he qiao ritual, coins are tossed into a bowl of water placed under the bridge to appease any malicious spirits who may be blocking the way. Finally, paper-money, know as mai lu qian, literally "money for opening the way", is strewn along the route to the graveyard to ensure an uninterrupted journey. Spirit money acts as a medium of exchange between the living and the dead. It creates a reciprocal relationship, enhancing the social interaction between the two parties. By burning lots of money, the living place the dead in their debt. The debt must be repaid in kind, with accumulated interest. Transfer of authority and status The analysis of inheritance cannot be limited to material property, but must take immaterial property into account as well. Many things exchanged during the death rituals have no fixed value. Authority and status clearly fall within this purview and are items that are exchanged at the death rituals. It can be suggested that the very act of burying the father signifies the transfer of authority from the father to the son. Death rituals allow for the displacement of the</page><page sequence="19">148 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science dead. The son is henceforth call the jia-zhang, the head of the family, a position that has power as well as responsibilities. Through the disposal of the father's corpse, the son assumes the role of social as well as ritual leader. Before death the father led all family rituals. Now the son is the main ritual sponsor. This is symbolized during the funeral by the son carrying a mourning staff, a wooden stick with a piece of white cloth tied at the end. The staff signifies the transfer of authority from father to son. DeGroot notes, for example, that the staff is "... not only a badge of mourning, but also a symbol of authority" (1892:168). Authority, however, does not work only in one direction, as the deceased continues to exert control even after death. In fact, the legitimacy of the authority of the new jia-zhang must draw on the influence of the deceased father. Shuzo Shiga (1978), for example, suggests that for the Chinese, the concept of personhood is one by which during the father's lifetime the son's personality is absorbed into the father's, while after the latter's death, his personality is absorbed into that of his son. It is suggested that a funeral has the effect of transforming the deceased into a spirit with charismatic authority.15 It is this charismatic authority of the deceased that legitimates the authority of the sons, as evident in the nature of social control within the Chinese family. For instance, whenever a child does something wrong, he is told that he is being unfilial to the ancestors and will have to be punished. In one case, a boy aged ten was punished by his parents for smoking a cigarette. He had to kneel before the family ancestral altar for three days. In this sense, punishment is not seen as being meted out by the father, but by a supernatural personality, the ancestor. Imbuing charisma into the ancestor has the effect of making the requirement of obedience a compelling duty. The obligation to obey the father becomes a moral imperative, seen as part of a moral order that is sacred and fundamental. Moreover, by elevating the deceased into a transcendent and eternal force, the social group is not just anchored by political power, but also by emotions, beliefs and fears. As Maurice Bloch suggested, "Society is made emotionally and intellectually unassailable by means of transforming the dead" (1982:41). The performance of death rituals can be viewed as a measure of the social status of the deceased and his descendants. On observing an elaborate funeral, one often hears comments such as, "He died a good death; just look at the large number of people mourning for him", or "He is a lucky man. He has so many sons to worship him and offer him sacrifices". Elaborate funerals are an impressive sight. Many people, attracted by the loud music and activity, gather to view the passing of the funeral hearse. Funerals portray the public face of the family. An ostentatious display increases the status of the sponsor and sponsored, while a lacklustre funeral will invite comments about "stinginess" and unfiliality of the descendants. As Yang also suggests, "the cult (affirms) relations with the wider social circle beyond the immediate family and (reasserts) the status of the family in the community" (1961:37). Status, or mian zi is extremely important in Chinese society in Singapore. In the form of prestige and renown attached to a family, it is readily convertible back into economic capital. Bourdieu suggests that this is, in fact, probably the most important form of accumulation (1971:179). Several key features of the funeral are used as indicators of social status. One of the most important is the coffin in which the deceased is buried. The first thing that visitors to the funeral often comment about is the quality of the coffin. A cheap coffin</page><page sequence="20">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 149 is a sign that the person and the descendants are so poor, "that they cannot even afford a comfortable home for the father". Moreover, a coffin made of inexpensive wood is said to rot very fast, thus exposing the body to the elements. There is an inordinate fear that worms will infest the body of the deceased; an unfortunate event to be avoided at all cost. Obversely, an expensive and well-constructed coffin not only ensures comfort, but indicates the prosperity of the deceased and his family. Many informants say they save money just to ensure that a good coffin is purchased.16 The type of ritual specialists employed at the funeral is also a mark of status. Buddhist priests rank higher than Taoist priests. They, in turn, rank higher than lay religious specialists. Buddhist priests are believed to be more knowledgeable about the ritual and more efficacious. Not surprisingly, the cost of engaging Buddhist priests is substantially higher. Furthermore, it is not only the type of priests, but the number as well. At least three priests are required. The ability to hire seven priests further enhances the status of the family. A large number of objects are burned as sacrifices to the deceased. In the belief that they are used in the Otherworld, the items are made to look as genuine as possible. The paper mansion sacrificed during the gong de, for example, is over ten feet tall and elaborately decorated, with trimmings and a full complement of miniature furniture. Similarly the paper-cars offered do not just resemble real cars, but are designed to look like a Mercedes Benz. The Mercedes Benz, a German-made car, is a symbol of wealth and affluence in Singapore. One son of the deceased said, "My father always wanted a ride in one of these. He never had the chance to do it in this life, so now we are giving two of them to him." By offering these obvious symbols of wealth, the deceased will attain a high social standing in the Otherworld. These items are put on display and burned in open places, in full view of the public, demonstrating the virtue of the family in offering elaborate sacrifices, and thereby enhancing their own social status. Other than being a measure of status, an elaborate funeral is also an indication of the ability of the family to mobilize social connections. There must be large crowds at the funeral. It demonstrates that many people are, in one way or another, obligated to take part in the funeral rituals. A long funeral procession immediately attracts the attention of the public. Obversely, a quiet funeral suggests that the deceased was an insignificant person. In the past, it was not unusual to find families hiring professional mourners to ensure that the funeral will be well-attended (Freedman, 1957:90). Nowadays it is more common to join mutual aid associations. These associations send representations to the funeral, thereby ensuring a large crowd. In sum, death provides an opportunity to elevate the status of the deceased in the Otherworld as well as demonstrate the status of the family in the community. To a degree, the actual financial resources or social status of the family are not important considerations. An elaborate funeral enhances status, even if it means incurring debts in the process. In Amoy, DeGroot notes that, Even though the departed has never been invested with an official rank or dignity, a Mandarin's retinue may likewise be seen in this part of the procession. The long-legged boards are then borrowed, either gratuitously or for money .... This manner of decking one's deceased parent in borrowed plumes does not in the least shock anybody. On the contrary, everyone highly approves of this sort</page><page sequence="21">150 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science of thing, as the doctrines of filial devotion teach that it is a sacred duty on the part of the children and grandchildren to exalt and magnify their seniors as much as it is in their power. (1892:165-66) I am suggesting that more than a mere sense of filial piety is involved. A funeral is also an investment. Status is seen as a attribute that can be transferred between the dead and the living. This is clearly exemplified in the practice of placing plaques of illustrious ancestors in the clan ancestral hall. Wooden boards of ascendants who had achieved high honours in the Imperial Examinations are honoured in a central location because they add prestige to the present members in the clan. By the same token, the achievements of the present descendants bring pride to the ancestors. Tapping the powers of the dead The transaction of property, authority and status have in common the fact that they are all attempts by the living to tap the powers of the dead to derive material benefits. Power for Chinese is li or neng li which is more correctly translated as strength or the ability to effect change. Another term that is associated with the concept of power is ling or efficaciousness. Given the homology between the worlds of the living and the dead, this power transcends the boundaries of man and spirits. The Chinese conceive of power as an invisible force that can be imbued in objects. The physical images of deities and ancestral tablets are believed to be sources of power. Power is imbued into the object by dotting the eyes of the deities with blood or red ink, signifying the entry of the deities into the images. Sacrifices are made before these images as they are believed to be the centres of power (Wee, 1977). Similarly, spirit mediums are consulted because it is thought that when they are possessed, the power of the shen is actually in the person. Ritual performance can be seen as attempts to obtain power to improve a person's life. Many Chinese will engage the services of spirit-mediums to perform huan yun or literally "luck-changing" rituals if they feel that things are not going well for them. In one case, a man was told, after his ba-zi was read by a religious specialist, that he was fated to have a short life, and would die at the age of 49.17 To alleviate this condition, he paid a large sum of money for special rituals to be enacted. By doing this, he thought his life would be extended an additional 30 years. Adoption by a deity is another way to obtain power. In one case, the mother of a boy who was in ill health was told by a spirit-medium to dedicate the child to the deity Guan Yin as the boy had a bad fate. After this ritual was performed the boy regained his health. The idea that death rituals provides for the acceleration of exchange can be seen in the way the Chinese manage the soul. It can be suggested that the very enactment of the death rituals allow the descendants to appropriate the soul of the deceased. The Chinese word for the soul is linghun. The soul is equated with the effectual power of a person. It is believed that the soul contains the qing or literally, the life-breath. Thus, for the Chinese, death is defined not as the termination of a life, but the separation of the soul from the body. As one person puts it, "The body will rot, but the soul is eternal and must be cared for." For</page><page sequence="22">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 252 the Chinese, the linghun consists of two parts, the hun and the po. The hun is the positive element and is equated with the ycing breath, which symbolizes light, life, warmth and productivity. The hun emanates from heaven. The po corresponds with the yin, the negative pole, and is associated with darkness, death, cold and the earth. The po is believed to emanate from the terrestrial part of the 18 universe. DeGroot noted the Chinese conception of a duality of the soul in nineteenth century Amoy: The chi breath is the full manifestation of the shen, and the p'oh is the full manifestation of the kwei; the union of the kwei with the shen is the highest among all tenets. The shen or immaterial souls emanates from the ethereal celestial part of the cosmos, and consists of yang substance. When operating actively in the living human body, it is called chi or breath and hwun when separated from it after death, it lives forth as a refulgent spirit, styled Ming. The kwei, the material substantial soul, emanates from the terrestrial part of the Universe, and is formed of the yin substance. In living man, it operates under the name p'oh and on its death it returns to the Earth. (1892:IV/3-34) There is a belief that the po (yin element) enters the body at birth. The hurt comes later, becoming more complete through the process of living. It is believed that the hun only enters the body after the "full-month" celebrations and is only complete when the person becomes an adult (Wee, 1977). Again, DeGroot noted a similar belief in traditional China: When a person is bom, the first thing that develops in him is what we called the p'oh ... after the p'oh is produced, we denote the Yang substance by the name hwun. Things of all sorts and kinds being subsequently used and handled by him, his tsing increases, his hwun and p'oh being thereby strengthened; and as a consequence he obtain his tsing perfectly sound and vigorous, and in the end, a shen or ming. (ibid:5) Following DeGroot, hun and po are joined when the person becomes an adult. Upon death, however, the two souls go their separate ways.19 It is believed that the hun goes through Hell to be judged, after which it returns to the home to become an ancestral spirit. The po, however, is reborn, and comes back into the world in the form of another person. For this reason, it is necessary to dispose of the negative po soul so that is will not return to haunt the family.20 The hun, however, must be reincorporated back into the family to become an object of worship. This is the reason why the correct treatment of the hun soul is of paramount importance for the Chinese. Immediately upon death the soul must be controlled to ensure that it will not get lost and to ensure its final transformation. A lost soul negates that possibility. In one case, the fact that the canopy for the funeral was not allowed to be located at a site desired by the family, a place with which the deceased was familiar, but is instead set four blocks away, making the whole family very anxious. One of the sons said, "My father had never walked there in his life, how is his soul going to find that place?" In this case, the family finally obtained permission</page><page sequence="23">152 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science to set up the canopy at the site they desired. The Chinese are also preoccupied with the idea that a person should die at home. In one example, a patient's family, when told by the doctor that there was little hope for recovery, insisted on transporting the patient back from the hospital so that he could die at home. Similarly, the wang xi fang and nai he qiao rituals signify the accompaniment of the deceased to the Gates of Hell. The funeral rituals are, in a sense, to ensure that the soul of the deceased will not get trapped in Hell. There is no worse fate for the Chinese than to have the soul of one's father unrecoverably stuck in Hell. The hun element of the soul, imbued in the joss-urn used throughout the funeral is carried by the eldest son back to the home. At the entrance of the home the descendants invite the soul to return into his house. Finally, the "dotting of the ancestral tablet" ritual is performed. A priest dots the ancestral tablet, strategically placing a mark over the word wang, which means king or lord, transforming it to zhu which means ancestor. This signifies the embedding of the hun soul into the tablet. The ancestral tablet now becomes the focal point for worshipping of the ancestor (see Wee, 1977). For this reason, the Chinese believe that the ancestor continues to have the same likes and dislikes as when he was alive. Thus he is offered his favourite foods, even his favourite brand of cigarettes. This dichotomization of the Chinese soul is significant. When asked why they perform death rituals, many Chinese will say that they are necessary in order to ensure that the deceased will not become a "hungry ghost" who will return to harm the descendants, but is transformed into an ancestor who will look after his descendants, and bless them with wealth, happiness and prosperity. This statement hides the dual purpose of Chinese death rituals. The enactment of death rituals is necessary in order to ensure that the po element of the soul undergoes reincarnation, that is, separated from the family of the deceased in order to ensure the family's safety. At the same time, death rituals are for the purpose of making the hun soul manageable and reincorporating it into the family (Wee, 1977). Thus the completion of the death rituals ensures that the refined soul is now under control and can be appropriated by the descendants for purposes of obtaining the benefits that death promises. Given the belief that the soul contains the effectual powers of the ancestor, it is not surprising to find that heated debates often centre around the placement of the soul-remains of the deceased, since their control signifies the control of power. In most cases the eldest son is the soul-receiver as he inherits the joss-urn and the main ancestral tablet of the deceased and is responsible for their care and worship. This allows him to appeal directly to the ancestor. The eldest son is in fact known as the chief inheritor. The eldest son, however, does not always have his way. In one case, for instance, the younger siblings joined together to insist that the father's ancestral tablet should not be kept in the home of the eldest son, but instead that all sons should have equal access. After some arguments, it was decided that the ancestral tablet should be kept in a Mahayana Buddhist temple. This did not alleviate the problem altogether, however, as they could not agree which temple was to be used. The temple-site suggested by the eldest son was opposed by some of the younger siblings as it was located very near the home of the eldest. Finally, a temple more or less equidistant</page><page sequence="24">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 153 from all the sons' homes was agreed upon. In this sense, the movements of the ancestral tablet highlight the self-interests of various family members, as well as define allegiances within the family. Attempts to control the disembodied soul can also explain the practice of making "substitution ancestral tablets" in Singapore. Although convenience in conducting rituals is the reason most often given for their existence, the tablet can also be seen as an attempt by the younger siblings to appropriate at least a portion of their father's soul for themselves. Like the soul, the Chinese believe that bone-remains are imbued with power and their proper management allows descendants to tap their resources. Thus, after cremation, bone remains are collected to become objects of worship. In the case of burials, when the graves are exhumed, it is vital that any remaining flesh (seen by the Chinese as female and polluting) be removed from the bones and that they be washed with rice-wine before reinterment.21 Most informants agree that in cases of burials, a fengshui expert should be hired to align the grave: "This is going to be the home of our father for many years. We have to make sure that it is as comfortable as possible." Furthermore, there is a sense that if the comfort of the bones is ensured, the descendants will be rewarded with good fortune and success. Some informants suggest that lucky lottery numbers obtained at the graveyard are often more accurate than those received at home. The explanation given is that the grave not only contains the soul of the ancestor, it additionally houses the bone remains, an extra source of power. The desire to spend money in order to obtain a graveplot with good fengshui is based on the hope that the proper treatment of the bones will ensure a reciprocal response from the ancestor, benefiting the ritual sponsors. Similarly, a good coffin is said to ensure the comfort of the deceased and the alignment of the grave is conceived of as ensuring the ancestor's physical comfort. To illustrate, in one case the descendants were delighted that the grave was sited right next to a tree. As one family member explains, "This will give shade to our father so that it will not be too hot for him in the afternoons." The grave is viewed as the home of the deceased, and like their own homes, it must be made as comfortable as possible. It should be noted that most informants perceive the placement of the bone-remains in real terms, and not simply to some abstract forces. In sum, the management of the soul and bone remains demonstrate the dual nature of Chinese death rituals. It is, on one hand, an attempt to dispose of the negative effects of death. On the other hand, it is the appropriation of the positive influences of death. Correctly managed, death offers great benefits. Conclusion The paper began with an attempt to understand a seemingly irrational practice: the expenditure of great amounts of money, even at the expense of incurring debts, to carry out funeral rituals. However, it becomes clear, within the context of the Chinese mind that there is an instrumental quality to the rituals. Believing that ancestors are clearly active participants in their relationship with their descendants, failure to ensure the comfort of the dead will not only bring bad luck, but also incur the</page><page sequence="25">154 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science displeasure of the ancestors who are capable of malevolent behaviour, and of initiating punishment against descendants for failing to enact appropriate rituals. The dead and the living, for the Chinese, have a reciprocal relationship. Moreover, I have demonstrated that death rituals are integrally tied to the transfer of property, authority, and status. However, it is not simply inheritance but the potential for greater benefits that motivates the descendants. It is also important to keep in mind that this calculated self-interest or egocentric motivation for ritual performance is seldom revealed and almost never made public. There is a "guaranteed misrecognition" of the gift exchange, most clearly seen in the discontinuity between the expressed reasons for performing the rituals and what is actually requested from the dead. When asked why funerals are necessary, most informants will say that it is the duty of filial descendants to care for the dead. Ethical and moral values important to the Chinese, such as filial piety, duty, and the continuity of the family line, are invoked as reasons for enacting the rituals. When we look at the items requested from the dead; wealth, good health, children's educational excellence, happiness, and "lucky numbers", however, it is clear that the enactment of elaborate ancestral rituals has to do with giving gifts to the dead and the expectation of larger countergifts. It must be emphasized that I do not privilege egocentric motivation over ethical imperatives, but suggest instead that the interaction of the two comprises a constant tension in Chinese society between the desire of an individual to act in his own self-interest and his attempts to fulfil his social obligations to the family group and the community. Notes 1 The particular funeral I am describing is for a deceased male. The differences between male and female deaths will be discussed where relevant. 2 In present day Singapore, it is not uncommon to find families engaging the services of a ritual speciahst to aid in the enactment of this ritual. The rationale given is that there is fear that the family will not perform the ritual correctly, and in the process, place the dead in grave danger. This specialist is always rewarded with a red packet for his services and willingness to come into such close contact with the dead. The red packet is believed to also have the effect of warding off the negative influences of death. 3 This bag of grains consists of millet, hemp, pulse, wheat, and rice. I was told that these are the basic food crops in China. Though some of these grains are not found in Singapore, it is believed that the dead in Singapore continue to eat them. 4 The character "T", nail, is a homonym for the Chinese word for descendants. 5 The canopy is a huge rectangular structure made of wood and canvas constructed near the home of the deceased. It is the site for the funeral rituals. Traditionally, the coffin would be kept in the main room of the home or in the ancestral hall. But because of spatial considerations, most Singaporean homes are too small to conduct the rituals, it is done outside the home. In a sense, the funeral, which is private ritual of the family, has become a ritual in the public domain. 6 These, however, are inadequate for explaining all the cases of exclusion. This will be discussed in detail later. 7 For easy reference, the kinship relationship is seen with the deceased as the point of reference. Thus, "sons" would mean the sons of the deceased, et cetera.</page><page sequence="26">Mortuary Rituals among Chinese in Singapore • 255 Both Buddhist and Taoist priests can be engaged to carry out the funeral rituals. In fact, it is not uncommon for the family to hire Taoist priests to conduct the final night rituals and then proceed the next day to a Buddhist temple to perform the cremation rituals. For a more detailed description of the various courts of Hell, see Henri Maspero, Taoism and Chinese Religion (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), pp. 176-182. Most Chinese in Singapore are aware of the existence of Hell and the punishments found there. Although it is accepted that there is always the possibility that the deceased may not complete the journey through Hell, the thought that one's own parents are stranded in Hell is never entertained. Other people's dead may get trapped in Hell. One's own never does. The fact that the zhuan Inn rituals are carried out attest to the belief by the descendants that the deceased has been given a rebirth. This certainty that one's parents are reincarnated is due to the belief that the very enactment of the death rituals is a means to ensure that one's parents will have a smooth journey through Hell. One informant said, "This is why we give so much money to the deceased. He can use them to bribe the judges of Hell." There is an apparent contradiction between the idea of the continued existence of the soul of the deceased as an ancestor and his being reincarnated. Most people are either unable to explain this contradiction or claim that they see no contradiction. This anomaly will be discussed later. It must be noted that fen jia does not refer to only a physical division of property. For example, it does not mean that the family must be living under the same roof. Particularly in Singapore, it is not uncommon for sons to set up their own separate households upon marriage. This does not mean that the jia has broken up. It has been suggested elsewhere that fen jia involves the physical division of the stove. (See, for example, Sung Lung-sheng, "Property and Family Division". In Emily Ahern and Hill Gates, eds., The Anthropology of Taiwanese Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1981.) In Singapore, this does not hold true because by setting up separate homes, the stove is already physically divided. A clearer understanding of fen jia, I feel, relates to the idea that the jia is integrally tied to the idea of religious worship. It signifies the joint worship of the ancestors led by the head of household, the father. One informant said, "As long as our father is alive, there is no division of the property." It is interesting to note that the Chinese word for jia is actually composed of two ideograms. The top half, is a roof, signifying a house. The bottom half is the character for pig. It is noted that in the Chinese family, the pig is the main object of ritual sacrifices. (See Paul Chao, Chinese Kinship. London: Kegan Paul, 1983, p. 8.) It can be argued that prior to the completion of the funeral, the deceased is believed to be a polluted gui. It would be dangerous to inherit the property of a ghost. This is probably the same reason why the Chinese in West-Town purchase faked posthumous titles for the dead. See Hsu, Under the Ancestors' Shadow (1949:47-48). Similarly, Ahern (1973) notes that for the Chinese in Chi'nan, "the living hope to inspire a further reciprocal response from the ancestors, to obtain through them the good life as they perceive it: wealth, rich harvests and offsprings who will ensure undying memory and sustenance in the afterlife." Weber defines charisma as "a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least, specifically exceptional qualities." (1947:329) Comber notes a similar preoccupation with good coffins (see Comber, 1954:7-9). The Chinese believe that the time of birth predestines the fate of a person. One of the methods to divine this is to use the ba-zi. It must be noted that there is some confusion and disagreement among informants as to how many souls a person actually possesses. Some informants suggest that a person has three souls. Upon death, each goes to a different place. One soul will make its way to the ancestral tablet, one will go into the Underworld to be judged and finally reincarnated.</page><page sequence="27">156 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science Others suggest that a Chinese only has two souls: one on earth, imbued in the object of worship, and one in Western Heaven. For some, each person has only one soul, which is worshipped by the descendants. Still others claim that a person can have a multitude of souls. Therefore, the concept of the dual soul that I use in this analysis is only one, albeit a common one, of a number of different ideas that the Chinese in Singapore have concerning the actual constitution of the souls. There are also different ideas regarding the final destination of the souls of the dead. 19 DeGroot echoed this view, "As long as the hwun and the p'oh keep together, life exists; but death ensues when they are separated from each other." Ibid., p. 6. See also Wee, 1977:219. 20 This idea of the Chinese conception of the human soul draws in part from Wee's suggestion that the Chinese soul consists of two portions, a personal soul component and a regenerate soul component. According to her, when a person dies, his soul leaves his body and goes to the Underworld to be judged. During rebirth, the personal soul component returns to the ancestral tablet to become a permanent ghost while the regenerate soul component is reborn. (See Wee, 1977:223-34.) The idea of a duality of souls has been noted by several researchers. Bloch, (1988:18-19) suggest that "the abstract soul(s) is "participating" in a sense in the collectivity of social persons (and hence is undifferentiated) while the concrete soul is more closely associated with the "individuality" of the person. Similarly, Erb, in this volume, notes that the Rembong has a sense of an "abstract" (community) and a "concrete" (individuality) soul. 21 See Tong (1990) for a discussion of the Chinese idea of flesh as polluting and bones as a source of power.
