It is not surprising that Geyser has become conspicuous in controversy, for the idealism and intuitionism which he has attacked have luxuriantly flourished around him. It is through controversy that he has reached his own position. He is an Aristotelian scholastic because he believes that Aristo? telian scholasticism contains more truth than any other historical system. He thinks, however, that neo-scholasticism should aim not so much at inter- preting as at developing the past. Huber points out that, as a realist, Geyser emphasizes, with Aristotle, the receptive character of cognition, though he believes that cognition is active as well. Cognitive activity, while not affecting that on which cognition is directed, does affect the content of cognitive acts. Truth, according to Geyser, consists in the correspondence between what is thought and objective facts. And logic must study objective facts, since laws of thought thus depend on laws of being. In opposition to Husserl, Geyser denies the reality of an independent world of ideal objects. In opposition to Bauch, he denies the reality of objective judgments. Anything that is must be a particular, and all essences and universals are in particulars. He emphatically asserts that the empirical self is a particular, and attacks all attempts to construct it out of a set of mental events. Geyser's disagreements with the idealists are legion?his repudiation of the transcendental self and his insistence on the contingency of every particular are further examples. But his position is not wholly dissimilar from Husserl's. Both philosophers are anxious to keep logic distinct from psychology, and to emphasize the importance of the intuition of essences (Wesensschau), though Geyser believes that intuition includes abstraction, while Husserl regards these two mental processes as fundamentally different. Nevertheless Geyser has vigorously supported proof in the great controversy about intuition and proof among German Catholic philosophers. He is opposed to all attempts, like that of Scheler, to base knowledge of the existence of God on intuition through feeling. In his view, the existence of God can be proved. God alone provides the ultimate explanatory principle of the world. God alone could have brought about the existing correspondence between our knowledge and objective facts. Only four other essays, two in each volume, can be mentioned here. In the first volume the essay of Artur Schneider, of Cologne, on "The Logical Relativism of Hans Leisegang" deals with some of those attempts to divide philosophical systems into types which have recently been so popular in Germany. The first of these attempts was made by Trendelenberg, but that of his pupil, Dilthey, has attracted special attention. Dilthey, as the result of an empirical study, believes that there are three constantly recurring types of philosophy: Materialistic Positivism (e.g., Epicurus, Hobbes, and Comte); Objective Idealism (e.g., Spinoza and Hegel); and the Idealism of Freedom (e.g., Plato and Kant). He also believes that the differences between types of philosophy are ultimately based on differences in temperament between philosophers. And since these temperamental differences will persist, variety in philosophy will persist. Karl Groos and Hans Leisegang have also contributed to 'typology*. The latter, in his Denkformen,1 holds that different types of philosophy are due to different types of logical thought?to different logics. Like Dilthey, he ends with a relativist view, believing that every philosophical system must be judged solely by the laws of the particular logic to which it is related. Schneider is opposed to all such relativism. In 1 Surveyed in this Journal, vol. v. pp. 108-9. 94</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY his view, the proper function of typology is to help us to discover the true philosophical system by clearly classifying our knowledge of past systems. Franz Sawicki, of Poland, brings the historical essays to a close with a discussion of the philosophy of history as part of philosophia perennis. His aim is to state certain fundamental doctrines which are common to many different philosophies of history and extend far beyond Aristotelian scholas- ticism. He admits that they are not common to all philosophies of history, but he claims that they are common to all that give "a reasonable explanation of historical development." Philosophia perennis asserts, according to Sawicki, that the development of mankind exhibits a purpose analogous to that of the individual; that the end to be achieved by mankind is the realization of values, the highest of which are religion and morality; and that personal activity and divine reason have an important influence on the course of events. Opposed to philosophia perennis are: first, all theories which regard historical development as meaningless?which relegate the theory of purpose to "the museum of human errors"; secondly, all theories which admit merely some negative purpose, such as the removal of pain by the renunciation of the will to live; thirdly, all theories which regard individual activity as ineffective. In his brief discussion of the grounds on which philosophia perennis rests, Sawicki argues that only if God exists can historical develop? ment be purposive. In the second volume Dietrich von Hildebrand, of Munich, writes on his conception of 'the objective good for the individual.' He distinguishes between three ethical concepts: what is good in itself, what is objectively good for the individual, and what satisfies the individual. A successful invest- ment is merely satisfying. Moral improvement is objectively good for the improving person. It is also good in itself. These examples show, not only that the three ethical concepts are different, but also that they are not mutually exclusive. Moral improvement, we see, is both objectively good for the improving person and good in itself. Similarly, health is normally good for the healthy person as well as good in itself. And certain states of affairs?as in the case of travel, professional success, or friendship?may both satisfy and be objectively good for the person concerned. Nevertheless, the three ethical concepts are different, in spite of the fact that they sometimes coincide. Hildebrand specially emphasizes the distinction between what is objectively good for the individual and what satisfies him. The true 'interest' of the individual is not always that which satisfies him. Illness may be objectively good for a person, while revenge or cocaine may satisfy him. What is good for the individual must not be confused with what is good as a means. What is good as a means is good only in the sense that it leads to something which is good in itself. What is objectively good for the individual involves a new and independent ethical category. Hildebrand believes that the recognition of this category reveals many new ethical problems and throws fresh light on many old problems. His essay makes many suggestions, and applies his doctrine, in some detail, to the conflict between egoism and altruism. This conflict, he says, cannot present a problem for ethics, if we confine ourselves to the two categories of the merely satisfying and the intrinsically good. If the individual ought simply to produce something good in itself, it is ethically irrelevant whether the good produced is his or another's. Only when we admit that moral action must aim at producing, not merely what is intrinsically good, but also what is objectively good for the persons concerned?only then does the conflict between egoism and altruism become ethically important. Hildebrand pursues the question why there should be an ethical difference between producing something good for 95</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES oneself and producing something. good for another person. Wliy, he quaintly asks, is it of no moral value to procure a tasty dish for oneself, meritorious to procure it for another, and still more meritorious to give away one's own share ? He answers that in procuring what is good for another we are aiming at his well-being, whereas in procuring what is good for ourselves we are often aiming merely at satisfaction. But he admits that the ethical distinc? tion between egoism and altruism is small in connection with goods whose power to satisfy is small. A. Rohner, of Freiburg in Switzerland, condemns those modern philo? sophers who begin with problems of the self and end with some form of idealism. In his view, metaphysics arises from the question, What is reality ? and its basic task is to discover the fundamental nature of reality. Problems connected with the human spirit or God should come at the end, not at the beginning. He thinks that Scheler's philosophical work is of special interest as an attempt to base a realistic metaphysic on an examination of the self. He briefly contrasts Scheler's position with that of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Saint Thomas Aquinas clearly realized that the basic metaphysical problem concerned the nature of reality, and he made the classic statement that everything that is consists of a whole composed of essence and existence, the nature of the whole determining their relative proportions. This view, according to Rohner, regulated all Saint Thomas Aquinas's further dis? tinctions, as, for example, between infinite and finite reality and between substantial and accidental reality; and it led to his doctrine that in God alone are essence and existence identical. Thus Saint Thomas Aquinas's whole metaphysical structure is based on his solution of the problem of reality. Scheler, on the other hand, begins with the nature of spirit. In God, spirit is the perfection of knowledge and value, and, although itself devoid of force, is combined with 'urge/ which is conceived as blind energy. Scheler regards spirit and urge as respectively essence and existence. In God they are unified; in man they are distinct, and there is tension between them. The function of spirit is to sublimate urge, and spirit comes into existence only in opposition to the material world. Spiritual activity involves three kinds of awareness: awareness of the world, awareness of the self, and aware? ness of God. Awareness of God is fundamental, and, in conjunction with the other two kinds of awareness, gives rise to religion and metaphysics. Rohner disagrees with Scheler's attempt to base metaphysics on awareness of God, with his attribution of blind energy to God, with his treatment of the relation between essence and existence, and with his theory of sublimation. II. Phenomenology Edmund Husserl's Formal and Transcendental Logic1 will be most appre? ciated by those who already know something about his philosophy. It assumes that its readers are familiar both with the special theories and with the special vocabulary which Husserl and his followers have developed. Nevertheless, even a novice, if he be prepared to read the book with patience and care, should not fail to grasp the fundamental points of phenomenology. Husserl is dissatisfied with the present relations between science and logic. The sciences, according to him, regard themselves as independent of logic and uncritically employ methods whose sole justification is that they are useful in practice. They rise above the naivety of the plain man only to become engulfed in "a naivety of a higher order." A genuine science, on the 1 Formale und transzendentale Logik: Versuch einer Kritik der logischen Vemunft. Halle Saale): Max Niemeyer. 1929. Pp. xi -|- 298. M. 14. 96</page><page sequence="5">philosophical survey other hand, must be based on an a priori investigation both of the nature of possible knowledge and of the methods by which such knowledge may be acquired. And this investigation belongs to logic, whose function is to dis? cover the essential nature of valid scientific inquiry and thus to provide a norm with which every actual science must comply. In this book, as elsewhere, Husserl emphasizes the importance of the a priori, and gives it a prominent place in phenomenology. Husserl holds that the existence and nature of every object depend on conscious acts of the transcendental self. He does not hold that all objects are mental states; on the contrary, he explicitly rejects this view. But he does believe that all objects are constructed by consciousness. Consciousness is essentially intentional, and it constructs its objects in a series of cognitive acts. No object is constructed by a single conscious act. A physical object, for example, is constructed by a series of perceptual experiences. Indeed, it is the awareness of some objective constituent persisting unchanged through a series of mental states that justifies our distinguishing objects from experi? ences. The conscious acts which construct objects are acts of the transcen? dental self. The empirical self is as much an object as a toothbrush; and, like all other objects, it depends, for its existence and nature, on the conscious activity of the transcendental self. But, although all objects, including empirical selves, are mind-dependent, they are of two distinct kinds. There are existent objects and ideal objects. Any particular person or thing is an existent object. Propositions, essences, and all the objects dealt with by logic are ideal objects. Ideal objects are as real as existent objects, and we know them with as much certainty as we know existent objects. But the two kinds of objects are different, and, though the evidence for both is ultimately direct (the object is "itself given"), they are known in different ways. The conscious acts that construct and reveal ideal objects are different in nature from those that construct and reveal existent objects. Formal logic, according to Husserl, must deal with logical objects (pro? positions, etc), not with logical experiences. It is concerned with what is logically thought, not with how it is thought. Two things about formal logic are of great importance. (i) The objective elements in logic may be ordered on three different planes, corresponding to three different ways of judging. First, there is the theory of propositional forms?logical grammar?a system of propositional forms constructed without reference to their compatibility or truth. Secondly, there is the logic of compatibility, a system of propositions constructed by reference to their compatibility. Thirdly, there is the logic of truth, a system of propositions constructed by reference to their truth. These three systems constitute formal Apophantik. (ii) Formal Apophantik is related to formal ontology?the system which deductively connects the completely general concept of 'being* or 'something' (Etwas uberhaupt) with its modifications, such as 'property,' 'relation,' and 'fact.' Formal Apophantik deals with what is thought to be, formal ontology with what is. The correla? tion between the two is complete, and together they make up formal logic. Transcendental logic is not concerned with the objective elements in logic. It deals with the conscious acts by which these objects are constructed and known. Every investigation of objects, whether they be existent or ideal, must be based on an a priori investigation of the conscious acts which con? struct them. Hence transcendental logic is a necessary study of the conscious acts which construct logical objects. It is necessary because it alone makes possible a complete understanding of logical objects. And it guarantees the validity of the positive sciences as well as of formal logic. Its own validity is guaranteed by its forming part of transcendental phenomenology?that G 97</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES investigation of the transcendental self's constructive acts which is its own guarantee. Husserl's attitude to Psychologismus is thus made plain. Formal logic deals with logical objects and must exclude all psychological considerations. Transcendental logic deals with those conscious acts of the transcendental self which construct logical objects. Psychologismus is doubly wrong. Like "bad idealism," it identifies objects with mental states. And it imports into logic an empirical investigation of the empirical self, whereas what is re? quired is an a priori investigation of the transcendental self. The small book On the Place of Epistemology in Philosophy,1 by Roman Ingarden, of Lemberg in Poland, consists of one of three articles which set forth Ingarden's views on epistemology. He distinguishes between pure and applied epistemology. In true phenomenological manner he regards the former as an a priori science concerned with the essential nature of possible knowledge, whereas the latter is concerned with actual knowledge. Episte? mology may seem perilously similar to psychology, on the one hand, and to the natural sciences, on the other; for, being concerned with knowledge, it must deal both with the subject and the object of knowledge. But, says Ingarden, it is concerned neither with actual subjects nor with actual objects. It considers subjects and objects only in so far as they are essential to know? ledge. The psycho-physical subjects of psychology are not essential to knowledge, nor are the different existing objects with which the different natural sciences deal. Epistemology is really much more similar to pheno? menology and the various ontologies. Phenomenology analyses the essential nature of conscious acts and epistemology the essential nature of cognitive acts. The ontologies inquire into the essential nature of different classes of objects, and epistemology into the conditions which valid knowledge of these objects must fulfil. Nevertheless, Ingarden stresses the point that, though related to phenomenology and the ontologies, epistemology is in no way logically subordinate to them. In his concluding section Ingarden urges that, while epistemology provides the sciences with tests of truth, it cannot provide them with data. III. Scientific Philosophy Very different both from phenomenology and from neo-scholasticism is the scientific philosophy expounded in Erkenntnis,71 a journal which con? tinues the Annalen der Philosophie, and is edited by Rudolf Carnap, of Vienna, and Hans Reichenbach, of Berlin. The outlook of this new journal is revealed by Reichenbach's statement, in his introduction to the first number, that philosophy must be based on empirical research in natural and mental science. And this outlook is made even more distinctive by most of the contributors to the first four numbers. Their articles present the view that philosophy has no special subject-matter; that it formulates no new propositions; that it analyses the propositions formulated by the special sciences; and that it is a method of clarification, not a science. According to the writers in Erkenntnis, philosophers who believe that philosophy does possess a special subject-matter are bound to ask nonsensical questions and to give nonsensical replies, because they talk about nothing.

About six numbers are tobe published, not neces- sarilv separately, every year. 9s'</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY sophy is firmly established in both Vienna and Berlin. The Ernst Mach Association in Vienna and the Society for Empirical Research in Berlin are both devoted to its promotion, and Er kenntnis is their journal. In 1929 these two societies arranged a congress in Prague for the discussion of the epistemology of the exact sciences. The second, third, and fourth numbers of Erkenntnis contain a full report of this congress together with valuable lists of each speaker's published works. It is interesting to note that, while most German philosophers never refer to any of their English contemporaries, the scientific philosophers do refer, and with great respect, to Russell, Whitehead, and Ramsey. Their chief authority, of course, is Wittgenstein. In the first number of Erkenntnis, Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap, the central figures of the Viennese group, set forth the distinctive view of philosophy outlined above. Schlick's article closely resembles the paper he read at the recent Oxford congress. He believes that philosophy has changed its direction, and that the sterile conflict of different philosophical systems is ended. The new view of philosophy as a clarifying process, not a science, will lead to the solution of all philosophical problems. This note of hope- fulness is struck again and again by different contributors. The existing confusion in philosophy is due, they say, merely to the asking of nonsensical questions. We are now able to see what questions can be asked; and, if a question can be asked, it can be answered. Schlick thinks that, though not itself a science, philosophy should be honoured as the queen of sciences. It gives the ultimate explanation of scientific propositions, and is thus the alpha and omega of scientific knowledge. Carnap describes the new logic that must be applied to scientific propositions and concepts. He believes that it has entirely superseded the old logic, and points out that it is essen? tially symbolic, that it recognizes relational propositions (with important results especially for mathematics and physics), that its propositions are all equally ultimate, and that they are all tautologous. His contribution to the attack on past philosophies is based on the tautologous character of. logical propositions and on the mere difference of verbal form between any deduced proposition and the propositions from which it is deduced. Philosophers mistakenly thought both that they could base existential propositions on logical propositions and that they could reach knowledge of objects not given in experience?as, for example, the Absolute?from knowledge of objects that are given in experience. At the end of his article Carnap outlines his view that all concepts, to whatever science they belong, are ultimately derived from immediate experience. We can construct a genealogical tree in which every concept has its place. Similarly, every scientific proposition is reducible to a proposition about the immediately given. Thus, ultimately, there are, not many sciences, but one. Another contribution to the first number is Reichenbach's article on "The Philosophical Significance of Modern Physics." Modern physics has shown, he maintains, that the so-called a priori, physical categories apply only to objects of medium size?to objects in the world of everyday experi? ence?not to exceptionally large or small objects, like the solar system or electrons. In the world of everyday experience space is at least approxi? mately Euclidean, and events are ordered by laws that are almost strictly causal. But the space of the solar system is not Euclidean, and causal laws do not apply to electrons. This discovery that the old, fundamental concepts of natural science apply only to objects of medium size constitutes the Copernican revolution of our time. How, he asks, are we to reconcile the world of physics with the everyday world? The difference between the two worlds is enormous. The concrete things of the everyday world can be 99</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES grasped and seen, and they are regulated by simple, easily ascertainable laws. The world of physics is a world of moving atoms in which there is no light, no colour, no sound. But if we regard such a world as incomprehensible, it is simply because we are blinded by custom. We are so familiar with the categories of the everyday world that we treat them as universally necessary. Nevertheless it is possible to know the newly discovered categories by in? tuition. We can form an intuitive picture of concrete things in Riemannian space, ordered, not by causal laws, but merely by laws of probability. More? over, the everyday world does, in certain important respects, resemble the world of physics, and an increasing recognition of these similarities is very desirable. Both worlds have the same ultimate criterion of knowledge? success in prediction. And the elimination of anthropomorphism which physics has achieved is gradually taking place in our ordinary life. Unwilling- ness to hold fast to beliefs merely because they are comforting is now a characteristic not only of science but also of our thinking in the everyday world. The discussion of probability and causality occupied a prominent place at the congress at Prague. Considerable interest was aroused by the paper of Friedrich Waismann, of Vienna, on "The Logical Analysis of Probability." Waismann attacks the theory, popular among participants in the congress, that probability is analysable into relative frequency. On this theory, if I say that the probability of a dice's turning up 2 is one-sixth, I mean merely that, given a sufficient number of throws, 2 will occur, on the average, once in every six throws. Waismann states two objections to this analysis. First, it implies that relative frequency is ultimate?that there is no sense in asking why a certain relative frequency occurs. It does not, and cannot, attempt to explain the fact that, if the dice is 'correct,' the probability of throwing 2 is one-sixth, and if it is loaded, the probability changes. And this position is untenable. Secondly, whereas observation discloses only finite series, the statistical theory of probability must, in order to be useful to physics, treat its series as infinite, mathematical series. And this procedure is fallacious, because a mathematical series is essentially law-determined, while a purely statistical series is essentially lawless. Advocates of the statis? tical theory would answer, says Waismann, that the required infinite series are merely ideal limits like geometrical constructions, and that such idealisation is as legitimate in the theory of probability as in geometry. But this Waismann, founding himself on Wittgenstein, denies. Ideal limits are not reached by refinement of the actual; they are given in advance. Geometrical laws, for example, provide a syntax in which actual spatial situations may be described. Where?as in the statistical theory of proba? bility?no system of presuppositions can be provided, there is no sense in speaking of idealization. Not being an ideal limit, a relative frequency cannot support the mathematical calculation which the statistical theory of pro? bability seeks to base upon it. Having made these objections, Waismann suggests another analysis of probability. This centres in the logical relation?the 'logical nearness'?of propositions. A proposition never refers to a single fact, but always to a region of facts. The smaller the region of facts referred to, the more precise and determinate is the proposition. One proposition follows from another if its region of facts contains that of the other. Two propositions contradict each other if their regions are wholly separate. Usually the different factual regions of different propositions overlap. The region of facts to which a proposition refers can be measured. If p and q are two propositions whose IOO</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY regions of facts can be measured, the probability of q in relation to p is the ratio formed by dividing the region common to both propositions by the region of p. This conception of probability, Waismann believes, is not open to the charge of subjectivity, for it entirely depends on the logical relation of propositions. Helen Knight. IOI</page></plain_text>
