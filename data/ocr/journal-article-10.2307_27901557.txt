<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE Dewey's formulation of a naturalistic account of experience has been criticized from time to time on the grounds that it is anthropomorphic, subj ecti vis tic and idealistic. In this paper I wish to examine some of the issues associated with these charges in the light of two recent discussions of Dewey's thought.i In his theory of experience Dewey seeks to achieve two major ends. First, and most important for the purposes of this essay, he aims at showing that the bifurcation of experience and nature is unwarranted. So he contends that experience qua interaction between an organism and its natural environment is both methodo logically and ontologically prior to the relative and qualified oppositions of organism and environment or man and nature that emerge within experience. The term 'situation* is introduced by Dewey to mark the fact that this union of man and nature is "prior to, netural to, and inclusive of, any distinction and relation that can be legitimately instituted between subject and object."2 Second, he holds that any phenomenologically accurate account of experience must avoid the extremes of block universe monism and atomism. The world comes to us neither as a single all-encompassing totality nor as a series of discrete atomic sensa. Rather, the situations which comprise experience are relatively comprehensive, unified and limited wholes. This, in turn, is to be explained by noting that every situation is pervaded by a quality. And the meaning of the term 'quality' is illustrated by pointing 1 Horace S. Thayer, The Logic of Pragmatism (New York: The Humanities Press, 1952). Hereafter referred to as LP. Richard J.

Hereafter referred to as PM.</page><page sequence="2">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 367 out that while words like 'red', 'hard', 'sweet', etc., serve to single out elements within a situation, quality words like 'cheerful', 'frightening', 'confused', etc., designate that which colors and permeates "all the objects and events that are involved in an experience/^ Finally, and this harks back to the former point, the quality pervading a situation is to be 'located' in the situation. In other words, predicates such as 'confused', and 'cheerful' are to be applied primarily to the situation and only secondarily to human selves. As Dewey puts this, "We are doubtful because the situation is inherently doubtful."4 The last point brings us to the first of the attacks on Dewey's theory of experience that we shall examine. According to H. S. Thayer, terms such as 'troubled' and 'disturbed' are to be predicated only of states of human creatures. So understood, they can be operationally defined via specifications of characteristic overt behaviour and certain physico chemical activities in the organism . . . But the meanings of these terms are fixed by having references to certain functions of living organisms.5 Further, to follow Dewey here and claim that these terms may be meaningfully predicated of situations is "hardly warranted by empirical procedure; it is animism at best."6 Thayer's charge is easy to refute. First, let us notice that there are three types of entities of which quality words might be predicated; (i) human beings, (ii) natural events or complexes and (iii) situations. Now Thayer appears to identify (ii) and (iii) despite the fact that Dewey defines (iii) as a complex whole which contains a human being as one of its components. After making this identification Thayer points out (correctly) that it is odd or incorrect to predicate terms such as 'confused* or 'troubled' of natural complexes. This, of course, is a contention with which Dewey is in complete agreement. But Dewey's point 3 John Dewey, Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1938), p. 69. Hereafter referred to as Logic. 4 Logic, pp. 105f. 5 LP, p. 79. 6 LP, p. 80.</page><page sequence="3">368 THE MONIST is that such terms are primarily predicated of situations, i.e., of the inclusive wholes rather than of the human components within these wholes. Thus, Dewey is not proposing that we attribute human properties to nature but arguing that these terms may be used correctly when speaking of 'human-natural-contexts' and this contention is hardly animistic. Moreover, Dewey's point does seem to be borne out first by the fact that it is perfectly correct to speak of a 'troubled', 'confused', 'unhappy' or 'pleasant' situation and second by the fact that we can and do use participial constructions of quality words in speaking of natural complexes (ii above). In the latter case (e.g., in speaking of a depressing or pleasing natural scene) we are 'really' attributing a disposi tional property to nature. This, rather than reflecting an animistic bias in man, is an acknowledgement of the fact that the environment does contribute something to the situation. Two further points should be made here. First, when Thayer speaks of operationally defining terms such as 'troubled' and 'confused' in terms of "characteristic overt behaviour and certain physico-chemical activities in an organism"7 he at least suggests that human behavior can be described in abstraction from the environment in which it takes place. This is diametrically opposed to Dewey's position.8 To see what is at issue here let us suppose Thayer is correct in believing that some purely behavioral indices of, e.g., doubt could be found. Would it follow that doubting is an activity which should be understood exclusively in terms of the human organism? Dewey's contention here is that if we are not to run the risk of transforming such a possibly valid scientific abstraction into one or another species of dualism it is necessary to emphasize the fact that it is only an abstraction performing a significant function in a limited context. This is one of the motivations for Dewey's insistence that quality terms be predicated of the situation. Finally, Dewey's theory of quality should be seen in the light of his desire to present a phenomenologically accurate description of experience. Now, it is obviously inaccurate to compartmentalize our experience of, e.g. a symphony (In aesthetic experience we are T LP, p. 79. 8 Cf., Logic, p. 25.</page><page sequence="4">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 369 most sensitive to qualities; however, qualities pervade all domains of experience.) into (i) the sounds heard and (ii) the emotive response to these sounds. To the contrary, the feeling and the sounds are experienced as co-present and, as Dewey's theory suggests, inter-fused. We do not experience a body of qualitatively neutral data 'out-there' and an emotive response to the body of data 'within ourselves'. Rather, we speak of feeling or hearing the excitement in the music and in doing so reflect the phenomological fact that the quality experienced is as much 'out-there' as the sounds, and as much a 'given-to-be-experienced' as the sounds. To bring this discussion to a head: while granting that Dewey's theory of the situation and quality is not without its difficulties, we have shown that the position is not animistic. More strongly, it can be argued that Dewey's theory has the virtue of indicating that ordinary language and experience accurately described point to the union of experience and nature rather than to any radical opposition between them. Once this is realized we can turn to the more difficult task of considering the implications and adequacy of Dewey's position. This brings us to Professor Bernstein's con tribution to this question. Bernstein devotes his attention to an examination of Dewey's efforts to eliminate the bifurcation of experience and nature. He advances two general theses. First, he contends that we do not discover a resolution of this difficulty in Dewey's thought. Rather, there is "a fundamental ambiguity in Dewey's philosophy between what we may call the phenomenological and metaphysical strains, an ambiguity which he never successfully resolved."9 Second, instead of finding the traditional dispute between idealist and realist undercut, it emerges that "the old opposition has not been avoided, but rather held together in an unholy alliance."10 Bernstein makes three further claims which, presumably, render these general points specific. First, we are told that in the course of defending experience Dewey construed experience so broadly "that it became increasingly difficult to see what was not experience, what if anything controlled and limited experience."11 Second, 9 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. 5. 10 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. 14. 11 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. 9.</page><page sequence="5">370 THE MONIST the historical development of Dewey's thought indicates an increas ing sensitivity to the task of coping with that which limits exper ience or, in slightly different terms, with the compulsive elements in experience. So, it is only late in his career that Dewey begins to view experience as that which *'checks the flights of imagination and the vagaries of speculation."12 Since this aspect of experience involves reference to nature, it is only late in Dewey's development that we find him seeking to specify the relationship of experience to nature.^ Finally Bernstein claims that in seeking to formulate an account of the relation of experience to nature Dewey emphasizes the continuity between the two and neglects the cleavages between them. This point is illustrated by Dewey's treatment of quality. In particular, Bernstein understands Dewey to hold not only that quality is present in all experiential contexts or situations but also that it is "intrinsically possessed by all natural existences."14 Before proceeding, two preliminary points should be made. First, the task of assessing Bernstein's charges is made difficult by the fact that nowhere in his article are the terms 'idealism' and 'metaphysical strain' defined. In view of this what I will do is indicate the two most plausible ways in which Bernstein's criticisms may be understood in the hope that this will at least illumine some aspects of Dewey's thought. Second, Bernstein cites two passages in Dewey's work to back up his interpretation of Dewey's theory of quality and Professor Kennedy, in his reply, argues that neither passage bears out Bernstein's chargers While I find myself in agreement with Kennedy it is necessary, I believe to press this question beyond the reading of specific texts. For, the fact that Bernstein and Kennedy disagree on the reading of texts suggests that Dewey's theory of experience may be somewhat confusing and that an examination of the leading principles of Dewey's argument is wanted. 12 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. 9. 13 An examination of this change is beyond the scope of the present essay. I have tried to show in my doctoral dissertation (John Dewey's Theory of Inquiry, Yale, 1961) that subsequent to Dewey's adoption of instrumentalism, some time between 1895 and 1904, there were no substantive changes in his thought. 14 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. ll. 15 Gail Kennedy, "Comment on Professor Bernstein's Paper," The Journal of Philosophy, 58, No. 1 (1961) , p. 17if.</page><page sequence="6">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 371 Let us first indicate the dialectical setting of Dewey's theory of experience. As we have already pointed out, throughout his career Dewey sought to refute the traditional dualistic account of the relation of experience to nature. The dualistic view, roughly that of Descartes, construes experience as the effect of an interaction between two substances, spiritual and material, or human and non-human, which are different in kind from one another. Further, on this analysis, the cause always "contains more reality" than the effect. Consequently, while it is, or may be, possible to argue that experience so understood will indicate the existence of nature it is not possible to hold that nature is present in experience simpliciter. In other words, nature qua experienced is only present in experience in some truncated form or, at best, nature makes its appearance in experience under the distorting conditions imposed upon it by a foreign medium. We can sketch Dewey's account of experience by showing how it controverts this theory at each of its crucial turns. First, according to Dewey nature is not composed of permanent isolated substances and the relations and effects resulting from their interactions but of histories of interacting events or fields.i Indeed, reality is composed of events and a thing or substance is no more than a single history of such events. Similarly, causality is not to be identified with the emission of some ontological force from a substance but (roughly) with the functional correlation of classes of events. 17 So, the familiar puzzles about the straight stick which appears bent in water and the round penny which appears elliptical under certain circumstances are easily dissolved. For, Dewey argues, the conception of a stick which is straight by nature (or objectively) and yet somehow appears bent under certain conditions is erroneous. In reality what we have is a series of changes which can be correlated with one another so that they form a single history. But no one of these changes is the 'sub stantial' or 'real' stick and no one of them has a privileged 16 John Dewey, Experience and Nature (2nd ed., La Salle: Open Court Publish ing Co., 1929), pp. 61, 82, 84ff., 91ff.

Idea." 17 EN, p. 90, note 1.</page><page sequence="7">372 THE MONIST ontological standing. Nor does the fact that we generally speak and think in terms of substances prove to be a difficulty for Dewey. The latter merely reflects our tendency to center a history about one of its component events and we select the event we do because it is either the one most frequently encountered or the one focal to the direction and control of the history in question. 18 Dewey's theory amounts to a transformation of the concept of experience. For, his position entails the view that in experience none of the reality of nature has been abrogated. In other words, experience is not the less real or distorted reflection of the inter action of nature and man but is 'nature-experienced'. Further, as the following passage will indicate, Dewey does not stop here but proceeds to argue a more powerful thesis. It is as much a part of the real being of atoms that they give rise in time, under increasing complications of relationships, to qualities of blue and sweet, pain and beauty, as that they have at a cross section of time extension, mass, or weight.19 Not only is reality composed of interactions but of interactions of increasing complexity and therefore 'things' take on differential properties depending upon the nature and complexity of the interactions of which they are constituents. So, an atom interacting with other atoms cannot be correlated with sentient events; but, when it is present in an experiential situation it obviously can be so correlated. Nor, can we hope to fully understand the nature of atoms if we deal with them merely in simple contexts. More generally, the simple does not necessarily reveal the nature of the complex any more than that which occurs earlier in time necessarily indicates the character of that which occurs later in time.20 In other words, as opposed to some traditional philosophers who believe that metaphysical understanding is reached by reducing things to their simple components, Dewey holds that such an understanding is only to be attained by treating of things at their 18 John Dewey, "A Naturalist Theory of Sense Perception," in Philosophy and Civilization, pp. 195, 198f. io EN, p. 92. 20 cf., John Dewey, "The Subject Matter of Metaphysical Inquiry," The Journal of Philosophy 12 (June, 1915), 338.</page><page sequence="8">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 373 most complex. Finally, because experience is clearly the most complex of natural interactions it follows that experience can be taken as the index of the nature of nature. In sum, instead of being a limited domain in which some (or much) of the reality of things is hidden or lost, experience emerges as the most compre hensive of the domains in which nature is revealed. In view of this brief sketch of Dewey's theory of experience we should be able to indicate what is troubling Bernstein. It is clear that Dewey's concept of experience is all inclusive in some respects and Bernstein claims, as we have seen, that this amounts to Dewey's adherence to an idealistic position. I shall now examine two specific types of idealism with which Dewey's theory might be identified. It may be argued first that Dewey is an ontological idealist. This, in effect, is a Hegelian or Whiteheadian reading of Dewey's thought. Specifically, Dewey is understood as arguing that human experience is continuous with nature on the grounds that nature causes experience or that nature is composed of entities or events which contain in primitive forms those characteristics which become prominent in human experience. So, he posits a spiritual substance or a number of spiritual events as the basic ontological furniture of the universe and the continuity of experience and nature is a substantive continuity. This line of argument is reflected in Bernstein's view that Dewey attributes quality to natural inter actions in which human beings are not components. The point being that Dewey is trying to read mental functions into nature-something he is forced to do in order to provide evidence for his ontological idealism. Aside from what we have already seen of Dewey's emphasis upon the continuity of experience and nature this reading may gain further credibility by referring to one of the central concerns of Dewey's Logic, i.e., the attempt to show "that biological functions and structures prepare the way for deliberate inquiry and how they foreshadow its pattern."2i Again, it may seem as if Dewey in seeking to deny the necessity of positing "the appearance on the scene of a totally new outside force"22 to account for the presence of human beings in nature must have recourse to 21 Logic, p. 23. 22 Logic, p. 24.</page><page sequence="9">374 THE MONIST attributing a mental or spiritual ground to nature. Reference may also be made to Dewey's insistence that the "traits, qualities, and relations found in things experienced, in the things that are typically and emphatically matters of human experience, which do not appear in the objects of physical science" are "inherently relevant and important" for a philosophical account of nature.23 Note should also be taken of Dewey's argument and procedure in Experience and Nature. There we are told, for instance, that the existence of human wants "would be a miracle" unless we granted the existence of "contingencies and incompletenesses" in nature24 and, finally, that the occurrence of thought is the "ultimate evidence of genuine hazard, contingency, irregularity and indeter minateness in nature."2^ Despite the fact that this interpretation does seem to capture much of the flavor of Dewey's thought it mis-represents his argument on a number of important points. The most serious of these is Dewey's principle of continuity. To see what is at fault here consider a 'straw man's' reading of the principle. This principle, it may be argued, commits one either to ontological idealism or ontological materialism depending upon whether one reads human characteristics into nature or holds that human character istics are merely 'appearances'. For if man and nature are continuous with one another then how can anything be present in man which is not already present in nature in some form? To argue, as Dewey does, that we can rule out both "repetitions of mere identities" and "complete breaks and gaps"26 is to try to have it both ways. That is, the principle of continuity seeks to allow for real differences between man and nature and yet argue that man and other natural entities are not different in kind from one another. But this is really no more than an attempt to think a contradiction. In short, either one acknowledges substantial identities or one acknowledges substantial differences. 23 John Dewey, "Nature in Experience," in John Dewey on Experience, Nature, and Freedom, ed. Richard J. Bernstein (New York: The Liberal Arts Press, 1960), p. 248. 24 EN, p. 55. 25 EN, p. 60, and see Chapter III in general. 26 Logic, p. 23.</page><page sequence="10">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 375 Now this type of argument might hold water if used against a philosopher who conceived of metaphysical inquiry in either de ductive or reductive terms. For, if we attempt to deduce experience from nature, or to show by a deductive argument how nature causes experience, then we must operate with concepts attributing no more to experience than has already been attributed to nature or our argument will be invalid. But neither of these conceptions of the goal and method of philosophical inquiry is germane to Dewey's thought. To see this notice first that a considerable part of the corpus of Dewey's work is negative in character. That is, Dewey is concerned to show that many philosophical problems are pseudo-problems which have been manufactured, rather than occa sions for genuine inquiry. The general technique of manufacture is, Dewey points out, to transform oppositions that are limited and contextual into isms that are wholesale and absolute.2? In the case at hand part of Dewey's argument consists in pointing out that the problem of establishing the continuity of experience and nature is, so to speak, a 'second-hand' rather than a 'first-hand' problem. The problem itself arises after different characteristics of events have been reified into absolutely different kinds of things.28 And then because of the terms in which the problem has been framed, we appear to be faced with the alternatives of denying the empirical differences which are at the basis of our classification or of showing how (per impossible) these two kinds of things can be related. So our straw man has argued: either accept the real differences as absolute differences in kind, in which case adopt dualism or deny real differences altogether in which case adopt either ontological idealism or materialism. Both alternatives are, of course, unattractive. We appear to be forced either to deny empirical facts or to invent a realm of pseudo-being (the realm of appearances) in which to retain the data whose possession is embarrassing us, or finally, to commit what Dewey labels "the philosophical fallacy" namely; to convert the eventual mental func tions with which atoms are correlated into an antecedently existing mental ground in the atoms itself.29 27 See, for instance, Logic, Chapter XXV. 28 EN, p. 214. 29 See EN, pp. 27f. and "Incl. Phil. Idea," p. 88.</page><page sequence="11">376 THE MONIST Taken methodologically, the principle of continuity reminds us of the pitfalls of our straw man's argument. It does not (as Bernstein's treatment suggests) endorse one of the alternatives offered. Rather, it points out that the argument rests upon a blunder and consequently, that neither of the alternatives need be opted for. And, of course, the principle does not invite us to think a contradiction. It enjoins us against (i) introducing ad hoc explanations of phenomena and (ii) framing our categories so that differences between things emerge as oppositions which dis allow that these things can interact. In other words, the principle of continuity responds to the presence of allegedly rigid oppositions as "a challenge to search for something that will eliminate the scandal of such sharp antagonisms in interpretation."3 o Furthermore, if we examine the way in which Dewey utilized this principle in his actual practice it is again evident that he did not attempt to formulate a metaphysics of ontological idealism or claim that natural entities have primitive experiences of qualitative immediacy. In general, Dewey conceives of his task as the formulation of a general categorical scheme which (i) applies to entities at all levels of existence in a non-question-begging manner and (ii) admits of being made specific in ways which call attention to the features characterizing the various different levels of existence. So, for instance, we find that organization, specificity in responding to the environment and dependence of an entity upon its environment are such general categoriessi and, when these categories are utilized to characterize living entities, they can be made more specific in such a way that we distinguish between behavior characterized as excitation-reaction, stimulus response and inquiry.32 Again, in his essay, "The Inclusive Philo sophical Idea" Dewey takes as his point of departure the formal notion of association and attempts to indicate, albeit schematically, how the notion can be made specific in ways which comprehend respectively, physical, vital and mental types of behavior. In neither of these instances do we find that Dewey has recourse to an idealistic ontology in his effort to show the continuity of nature 30 "Incl. Phil. Idea," p. 87. 31 EN, pp. 208-211. 32 Logic, p. 29ff.</page><page sequence="12">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 377 and experience. In sum, the principle both of his general argument and of his practice is development. He contends throughout that 'additive' properties emerge as interactions grow in complexity33 and that from such interactions there emerge "new and unique qualities not manifested in the lesser areas of natural association."34 One more point before we leave this reading of the charge that Dewey adhered to an idealistic position and this concerns Bern stein's claim that there are two mutually inconsistent strains of argument in Dewey's thought. What we have seen here is that along with the attempt to accurately describe experience (the phenomenological strain) Dewey seeks to articulate a categorial scheme which applies to all levels of existence. Now clearly these are two different (though not unrelated) philosophical activities and the latter may well be labelled the 'metaphysical strain' of Dewey's thought. But it should be clear that this 'metaphysical strain' is not to be identified with some or even much of the type of thing that goes on in traditional metaphysics. Finally, the accurate description of experience and the formulation of a categorial scheme which points out the errors in fallacious theories of experience complement rather than oppose one another. The second type of idealism which Bernstein appears to find in Dewey's work may be labelled 'methodological idealism'. Consider the following: Dewey claimed so much for experience that it became increasingly difficult to see what was not experience, what if anything controlled and limited experience. It looked as if Dewey, who had so many harsh words about idealism, was serving it up in another form.35 The general point here should be clear enough. If 'experience' is a 'blanket-term' in Dewey's vocabulary, i.e., if it applies to absolutely everything, then Dewey's claim to have overcome the dualism of experience and nature can have little or no meaning. For, even assuming that experience is continuous with nature it is necessary that the terms 'experience' and 'nature' be defined so that the principle of continuity does not emerge as a mere 33 "Incl. Phil. Idea," p. 87. 34 "Incl. Phil. Idea," p. 91. Italics added. 35 "J. D. Met. Ex.," p. 9.</page><page sequence="13">378 THE MONIST tautology. Moreover, from the standpoint of native common sense which Dewey is intent upon maintaining, nature rather than experience should emerge as the all encompassing domain of existence. But if there is nothing which is not experience for Dewey then this, obviously, will not be the case. Accepting the general tenor of these points, what I would urge is that there are various ways in which Dewey construes the relationship of experience to nature. Further, the fact that there are some respects in which 'experience' is a blanket-term ob viously does not entail that it is so in all respects. Specifically, we shall see that there are three ways in which 'experience' is a comprehensive term in Dewey's vocabulary and argue that in each instance Dewey's usage calls attention to the existence of elements which limit and control experience. First, as we saw in some detail, experience is all inclusive for Dewey in the sense that experiential processes are the most compre hensive natural processes. Consequently experience may be said to 'contain' nature. But this, of course, does not mean (i) that all natural entities have the properties of human beings or (ii) that there is nothing which exists beyond the fact of human experience. What is asserted is that nature as the totality of processes and entities controlling and limiting human experience is not ontologically different in kind from that sub-class of nature designated 'experience'. Hence it is that experience can contain "the materials and the processes and operations" which yield knowledge of nature.36 The second respect in which 'experience' is a blanket-term for Dewey turns upon the fact that he follows James in holding that 'experience' is a "double-barrelled word." The term refers to both "what men do and suffer . . . and also how men act and are acted upon." s7 Again, it "denotes the planted field, the sowed seeds, the reaped harvests, the changes of night and day . . . that are observed, feared, longed for; it also denotes the one who plants and reaps, who works and rejoices."38 If we now press Bernstein's question, What, then, is not experience? it 36 John Dewey, "Nature in Experience" in PM, p. 195. 37 EN, p. 10. 38 EN. p. 10.</page><page sequence="14">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 379 appears that the only reply forthcoming is, Nothing. But look at the structure of this statement. Dewey introduces his point by calling attention to the difference between the objects and process of experience and then contends that the phenomenon of expe rience encompasses this difference. Contrary to our initial suspicion, what is suggested here is that part of the very meaning of the term 'experience* involves reference to the presence within expe rience of limiting and controlling objects. In slightly different terms, for Dewey experience is always experience of nature. As he puts it, "It is not experience which is experienced but nature stones, plants, animals.. ."39 As evidence of this Dewey points to the fact that "in every event there is something obdurate, self sufficient, wholly immediate ... terminal and exclusive."40 Thus in arguing that 'experience' is a "double-barrelled word" Dewey is not seeking to gloss over the cleavages between experience and nature but indicating that experience as a dynamic structure forces us to recognize the existence and claims of nature. We can turn now to the third respect in which 'experience' is a blanket term for Dewey. Both in theory and actual practice Dewey urges that any empirical inquiry must take experience as its point of departure. So in his own philosophizing, the nature of nature is determined on the basis of inquiries departing from experience and this may suggest that nature has a secondary significance for Dewey. Now there is a very broad sense in which, all his statements to the contrary notwithstanding, Dewey's primary concern with the problem of knowledge can be taken as evidence of this fact. But, in regard to the limited question at issue here two points may be urged. First, in claiming that experience has ultimate methodological priority for determining the nature of nature Dewey does not mean anything more than that every inquiry departs from 'had' or 'given' data. He does not mean that one domain of nature (namely human experience) should prejudice our view of the nature of nature as a whole. Thus, his insistence that human characteristics are significant for a general understanding of nature is simply a demand that all of the data available be used in characterizing nature. Second, Dewey does 39 EN, p. 4. 40 EN, p. 73.</page><page sequence="15">380 THE MONIST not mean that the theory of experience has some sort of priority over the theory of nature. His point, to the contrary, is that the theory of experience and the theory of nature are dependent upon one another. As he puts this, if we look at human history and especially at the historic develop ment of the natural sciences, we find progress made from a crude experience in which beliefs about nature and natural events were very different from those now scientifically authorized. At the same time we find the latter now enable us to frame a theory of experi ence by which we can tell how this development out of gross ex perience into the highly refined conclusions of science has taken place.41 In short, our understanding both of experiential and extra experiential processes has been elicited from vague and comprehen sive data which have been progressively refined. What we have seen here is that there are three ways in which 'experience' is a more inclusive term than 'nature.' First, 'ex perience' designates the most complex and hence the most comprehensive natural processes and thus can be said to include nature in the sense that the more complex includes the less complex. Second, the phenomenon of experience itself is inclusive, i.e. the process of experiencing and the object of experience are mutually inter-dependent and 'given' together as a single com plex datum. Third, experience taken now as the data (and this, it should be evident, includes the beliefs a given inquirer holds) from which inquiry departs is vague and inclusive and so, contains the basis for both a theory of nature and of experience. But, as opposed to Bernstein's charges, we can urge that all these proposi tions must be valid if we are to be able to proceed from the phenomena of experience to the wider scene in which experience is set. So, instead of denying the existence of nature as a limiting body of entities and processes which control experience, when Dewey makes experience an inclusive notion he is attempting to show how it is that nature is encountered and known. 41 "Nature in Experience," in PM, p. 247.</page><page sequence="16">DEWEY ON EXPERIENCE AND NATURE 381 To sum up: Dewey's theory of quality is neither animistic as Thayer charged nor idealistic as Bernstein charged.
