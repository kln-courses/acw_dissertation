<plain_text><page sequence="1">20 'MEXICANIDAD' THE RESURGENCE OF THE INDIAN IN POPULAR MEXICAN NATIONALISM! SUSANA ROSTAS 'MexicanidacL' is not so much a struggle for mainstream political power as a proto-nationalistic 'indianist' movement or subculture, whose supporters are socially marginalized young males in Mexico City (and elsewhere). The paper explores how the actors, by articulating meanings taken from the pre-colonial past in processes of socio-symbolic elaboration, are creating new identities for themselves with which to challenge, performatively, the priorities of the state. Currently many indigenous groups in the Americas are involved in the struggle for improvements to their rights. In Mexico, the struggle has grown in intensity since the Chiapas uprising of 1994 and not only do numerous old and new organizations exist,2 but proposals have been put forward to establish pluri-ethnic regions (see for example Burguete Cal y Major 2000). Such struggles may take years to gain any ground, but in this paper I will be looking at a rather different type of activity: the performative suggestions of predominantly mestizo groups in Mexico City, who claim to reject their country as it is currently constituted. 'The Mexica', as such people call themselves, dance in, amongst other locations, the central square of Mexico City and are by now well known in the Mexican national space. Photographs of them appear frequently in daily newspapers portrayed as Aztecs, dressed in costumes based on the codices, crowned by exuberant feather headdresses with seed rattles tied around their ankles. This is how they accoutre themselves to espouse the cause of mexicanidad at ceremonies to glorify Aztec culture heroes, or ritual dances performed on significant dates in the Aztec calendar or, less frequently, for events related to the indigenous people of Mexico. I would like to thank Goldsmiths' College for financial assistance to attend the LASA conference in Guadalajara, Mexico where this paper was originally presented in 1998. Since then a number of theses have been completed by Mexicans on the theme of Mexicanidad (De la Pena Martinez 1999, Vasquez Hernandez 1999, Gonzalez Torres &amp; Acevedo Martinez 2000). Such as the FIPI, Frenete independiente de Pueblos Indios etc. Cambridge Anthropology, 23:1, 2002</page><page sequence="2">'Mexicanidad' 21 Predominantly born and bred in Mexico City, the Mexica are not only the children of capitalism but have also been inculcated into ideas of nationhood since their early childhood. When they dance in the Zocalo, under the windows of the National Palace, a building that represents, most essentially, the hegemonic power of the State, they are performing in a place that is not only in the centre of Mexico City itself, but also the site where the idea of Mexico as nation-state is continuously regenerated. Every day, in both the morning and the evening, the national flag is ceremonially raised in the square's centre having been taken out of the adjacent National Palace with full military backing accompanied by a brass band. Yet the Mexica claim that they do not want to be part of this authoritarian Mexico, nor party to the state's plans for ever greater involvement in the processes of globalization that the capitalist project entails. In this paper I will be looking at the historical background to their current position and arguing that because they perform their dances predominantly in this location, whilst also articulating a mythopoetic discourse about a possible neo-Aztec future, they are, by so doing, probably playing into the very hands of those they claim to want to reject. The Mexica are, they claim, in search of the 'real Mexico', the Mexico that existed prior to the Spanish Conquest, which has been systematically destroyed ever since. I will be looking not, then, at mainstream nationalist sentiments, the sense of being part of the greater Mexico, which is difficult to avoid for those who live in Mexico City. Those I am analysing undoubtedly have this sense, but are fighting against it and see Mexican society as it is currently constituted not as a source of opportunity and hence empowerment (as their indigenous forbear may have done) but rather the opposite: they are actively stating [albeit largely performatively], that they do not want to take part in mainstream urban life and their perceptions of it are that it can only fail them. They propose a form of proto-nationalism, as yet largely performative and informational. Although this tends to be seen by outsiders as mere escapism but can be seen analytically as a 'collective imaginary' (Escobar 1992: 68), a proto-nationalistic social movement or a subculture to be tolerated - constituted as it is, in a way that is as yet apparently [non contiguous] with other existing social structures. But to the proponents it is much more than either of these. It is a means to achieve a reinvindicacion of the indigenous past that will lead them to a better future: for them very much the only path worth following. The Mexica are not alone in feeling that there is something amiss with the national project. For decades but especially in the run up to the so-called 'celebrations' to mark the 500 years since the 'discovery' of the Americas held in 1992, there has been a spate of publications on the subject. Lomnitz-Adler in his book Exits from the Labyrinth (1992)</page><page sequence="3">22 Susana Rostas suggested that analysts know plenty about the representations of the national space - such as the literature by the 'thinkers' (pensadores, as he calls essayists such as Octavio Paz) - but very little about its sociology; about what is actually going on. There is, he claims, a vicious circle 'built on the tensions that occur between the maze of social relations that exist within the national space and the ideologies regarding a common identity, a shared sense of the past, and a unified gaze towards the future' (Lomnitz-Adler 1992: 3). It is the failure to find a way out of this circular dialectic, the labyrinth (of his title) that is stopping Mexico advancing. Another slightly earlier book, Bartra's Cage of Melancholy (1987/1992),3 suggested that Mexicans are trapped by a paternalistic authoritarian government that creates a sense of disempowerment. It is because of this en-cage-ment, he claims, that Mexicans have not yet been able to 'finish' themselves: that is emerge as a democratic people. Neither Lomnitz-Adler nor Bartra are proposing that the national project be abandoned, while in essence this is what another anthropologist, Bonfil, or at least some of his interpreters, have been suggesting for some time. He senses that Mexico is forgetting its roots, that the 'profound'4 Mexico, so central to the establishment of the nation state in the 1920s is being ignored. He claims that the burdensome state apparatus founded on Western ideals of hegemony has produced and is still producing what he calls an 'imaginary' Mexico, 'which assumes itself to be the bearer of the only valid plan for the country's future' (1987: 174). For Bonfil, Mexico as Nation State has imposed its language and cultural codes by means of the top-down/hegemonic machinery of government, on a plurality of smaller communities (Anderson 1991). His claim is that this imported model of development has ignored the 'real' Mexico and failed to use the diversity already to hand. Bonfil's suggestion that Mexico could return to a 'Mexico Profundo' seems at best romantic at worst naive, as he does not indicate how this could be achieved, but it clearly touches something that many Mexicans feel very strongly.5 Published originally in Mexici in 1987 under the title La jaula de la melancolia (Grijalbo). Bonfil uses 'profound' in the title of his 1996 (1987) book Mexico Profundo in which he characterizes Mexico as a country of people who still have close ties with their chthonic roots, with their earlier pre-hispanic civilization. The perception that the machinery of government is not one produced sui generis but exported from elsewhere and imposed was heightened by the signing of the NAFTA agreement in 1994, through which Mexico finally became, supposedly, an equal partner as a producer with the US and Canada.</page><page sequence="4">'Mexicanidad' 23 Looked at historically, this process of imposition began long ago at the time of the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards.6 Some Mexicans have refused to forget the slow dissolution of Aztec society that, it is claimed, looked after its citizens well, although some were slaves and others were sacrificed. This resentment has simmered for centuries, as 'foreign' ideas or institutions have been forcibly imposed by post Hispanic invaders or were imported one by one from Europe or the USA. The fervour of wanting Mexico for the Mexicans, of wanting to purify it and scourge it of all extraneous elements and the laying of great emphasis on its cultural patrimony, particularly that of the Aztecs, increased once again with the renewed self-consciousness brought about by the so-called celebrations for the 'discovery of the Americas' in 1992. This is not, however, a new phenomenon. Mexico has a long history of reinventing the past which has been loosely linked, at times, to a desire to preserve and integrate aspects of its indigenous cultures and peoples. On the first, Mexico's independence from Spain in 1813 produced a neo-Aztec movement (Brading 1985). There have undoubtedly been various neo-indigenist or indianist movements since then, but the best documented is the one which emerged in the 1950s, a middle class movement with few links to the grass roots, the Confederated Movement for the Restoration of Anahuac (movimiento confederato restaurador de la cultura de anahuac) (Odena Giiemas 1984). It consisted almost entirely of 'erudite contemporary idolaters': Mexico City elites (particularly lawyers) who read up on the Aztec past and elaborated 'invented' Aztec ceremonies to various culture heroes (Paz 1972: 91; Friedlander 1975; Rostas 1998a). Indigenous culture became politically significant after the revolution of 1910, and the use of indigenous elements or traits became an important aspect of 'indigenismo' which at the same time attempted to integrate indigenous peoples in the interests of building up Mexican nationalism. In the 1960's, the opening of the new Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Mexico City celebrated the multiplicity of such cultures, while on a more cotidian scale, primary schools in central Mexico encourage every child to become involved in building an alter for the Day of the Dead (All Souls), a celebration that pre-dates the Spanish conquest. This the Mexicans have never forgotten or forgiven as it caused the destruction of a civilization that in many ways was superior to that of the conquerors. Although Mexicans do tend to conveniently forget that in pre colonial times, one group of Mexicans conquered and imposed their ideas on another; that the Aztec empire itself was of only very recent origin at the time of the Spanish Conquest and was in fact inherently unstable because greatly over extended.</page><page sequence="5">24 Susana Rostas There have thus been two distinct threads, sometimes interwoven but fundamentally different. 'Indigenismo' implies a desire to integrate the rural indigenous population and their cultural traits into the nation, and 'indianism', which recently has come to be used of those who assert the need for autonomous development (Knight 1990). Indianism or rather indianist movements have come in various forms: those groups who were cultural extremists, 'parlor aztecofiles' as in the case mentioned above (ibid 1990: 81), versus those who were more politically radical and who argued for autonomous development of the indigenous populations. Most recently, there has come into being a more 'vigorous' Pan-American indianist movement, which sees indigenous populations as 'potential nations' and like the extremists, sees indigenous culture as a 'valid alternative in the face of western civilization' (ibid: 106, footnote 56). But can Mexico be said to have a non-hispanic or pre-hispanic population? The indigenous population has continued to exist but only as a rural peasantry, distant from the mechanisms of the developing . state and still largely outside its economy.7 In Central Mexico, such populations have mostly undergone a process of mestizaje, through the centuries, while in other areas the rural indigenes, with a subsistence economy, have long since been marginalized and disempowered. They have tended to be exploited rather than assisted, submitted to ethnic genocide rather than privileged and until recently have been largely unrepresented, because mostly ignored in the national project. The appearance of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (the EZLN (Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional) in Chiapas in 1994 has started to enable a process of rural empowerment (from outside the established system) but the negotiations to achieve more representation and hence consideration at a Federal level are only going ahead slowly and there has been further genocide at the hands of the army throughout the 1990s. The stratified indigenous urban society, that existed before the Spanish Conquest, disappeared long ago as it intermingled with the Spanish system and, as it did so, lost any specifically indigenous representation at the centre. The indigenes in most cities today are either those that are there to work for temporary periods and whose long term base is in the countryside or the culturally dispossessed: those who have given up on a life on the land and have succumbed to the proletarian path. The Mexica are the children predominantly of the latter group of people, who despite being to all intents and purposes mestizo, nonetheless want to make claims to being indigenous and are demanding, performatively at least, a different future for themselves. Numbering some 10,000,000.</page><page sequence="6">'Mexicanidad' 25 The Mexica, like the members of the earlier movement, are often described as 'cultural extremists'. But they are also spiritual extremists with a nationalistic bent. According to the popular writer Velasco Pina whose novels have been one of the strong formative influences on them, Mexico is to become, in the near future, the centre of the spiritual world (as this moves westwards from Tibet).8 The present, then, is not just a crucial moment economically and socially but also cosmically, giving mexicanidad some of the qualities of a millenarian movement. I want now to look in more detail at who the Mexica are before returning to the main argument. The Mexica The Mexica are predominantly male, young and mestizo. They live in Mexico City, some in the older, longer established but now run down central parts of the city, but mostly in the rapidly growing barrios that are expanding ever further into the countryside; some are from rural communities. Their experience of life in the city is that it has very little to give them. There are few jobs, few chances of training or further education. But perhaps more pertinently they are not interested in the jobs available: to take work in a factory would be to succumb to the very system they are wanting to reject and would be insufficiently varied and interesting (but might be considered for a while in the USA because so much better paid). Some are involved in 'flexible accumulation' (Harvey 1989: 189): part-time work in the service industries or other enterprises. More make their money when and how they can as part of Mexico's growing black economy. Many are perhaps best defined as 'New Age'. Pedro, for example trains dogs in the morning and sometimes in the evening near to where he lives on the outskirts, makes enough money to subsist and has free time for Mexica activities, when he prefers to be known as Tecpancalli. Jorge (alias Cuauhtemoc) practices indigenous medicine between dances and other events. Metztli (Carlos) achieves what many would like to be able to do: he makes all his income from Mexica-related pursuits; the fabrication of headdresses, feathered shields and leg rattles. Velasco Pina has published a number of novels based on historical themes. Tlacaelel (1979) depicts what life might have been like in Tenochtidan at the time of the Aztecs. While Regina (1987) combines recent historical events, the death of a young Olympic during the repression of student demonstrations at Tlatelolco in 1968 with the esoteric: she was predestined to sustain the chakra that is Mexico. More recently he published The Return to the Sacred. The popularity of his books can be assessed by the size of the print run: for Regina, 7,000 copies of the second edition.</page><page sequence="7">26 Susana Rostas The Mexica are the young who have frequently been marginalized because of their ethnic origins. For although Mexico may now be predominantly a mestizo nation, and the castas9 long since forgotten, racism is still rife; a white skin still brings much better opportunities (Weismantal &amp; Eisenman 1998). For the majority of migrants or second generation inhabitants in Mexico City, the aim has been to rid themselves of those indigenous traits that emphasize their ethnic origins, such as language and dress. Skin colour is however ineffaceable. But the Mexica are turning the negativity of this trait and others around. Those attributes that in early life may have acted against them, they are now deploying to build up their movement. Proud of their skin colour, they flaunt it as they dance in Aztec style costumes that show off their bodies. They want to redeem rather than reject their linguistic inheritance; they privilege Nahuatl (the language of the Aztecs) over all others and many are learning it.10 The use of this language is a significant part of their identity construction. The Mexica, despite being 'mestizo' according to official classification (and common usage), are, as members of one of the many smaller self developed groups (Kalpulli) which make up mexicanidad, redefining or reclassifying themselves as 'indigenous'.11 But this begs the question as to whether mexicanidad is really to do with 'race' and not rather a reaction to a class position: an attempt to mask class relations with ethno-cultural elaboration, with an invented ethnicity. In other words, Mexicanidad is much more to do with identity politics. Prior to becoming Mexica, many suffered from the kind of anomie that characterizes life in a rapidly changing environment: what did they identify with, where did they belong? In one sense, they knew that they had begun at the bottom of the pile. But they went to school (or at least some of them did for a while), they hung out in the local vicinity, drank, smoked, played football, went dancing, attended cockfights or dog fights perhaps, were part of various gangs or groups, but none of these pursuits could give them a sense of purpose in life (Gutmann 1996). For many that lacuna in identity formation (and socialization) has been filled by mexicanidad. 9 The castas were the categories into which the non-white population of Mexico were classified. In urban areas there were as many as 16 sub-categories of the intermixture of white, indigenous and black (former slaves). This racist classification was abandoned after the revolution of 1910 (Lomnitz-Adler 1992: 269-73). 10 The overall number of indigenous languages in Mexico is still quite large (c.57), but it was Nahuatl that was spoken throughout the Central region. 11 Caso has suggested that an indian is one who feels that he belongs to an indigenous community (cf Knight: 1990:75) which is as Knight points out the extreme of the phenomenological approach but which increasingly is a position which is coming to be accepted.</page><page sequence="8">'Mexicanidad' 27 Mexicanidad Mexicanidad is being constructed in reaction to the disorientating, identity-threatening and anomie-creating processes of the hegemonic state. But what is it? Can mexicanidad be classified as a socio- or politico cultural movement? Certainly the idea of what a social movement can be said to be, has shifted over recent decades. Many of the actors have increasingly been seen to be engaged not so much in struggles to gain better material conditions,12 as in cultural reformulations or strategies, that is in a form of socio-symbolic elaboration in the search for new identities which involves articulating contested meanings (Escobar &amp; Alvarez 1992, Escobar 1992, Melucci 1985, Evers 1985). Escobar has described the task ahead as 'the construction of collective imaginaries capable of orientating society and political action' (1992: 68 but see also Rostas 1998b) Mexicanidad is certainly constructivist rather than essentialist and has a performative agenda which is socio-cultural rather than Political (Warren 1992, Watanabe 1995, Melucci 1985). In general in such movements the meaning of the action is to be found in the action itself rather than in the stated or pursued goals. As the action is focused on cultural codes, the form of the movement is itself the message (Melucci 1985: 801). Such movements need no longer be dramatic events that penetrate to the 'cupola' of power. Even though they occur at a level way below existing hegemonic power relations and may never develop into a 'revolutionary threat' to the dominant society, the 'doing it differently' at an every day level in itself signifies and can be a potential danger. So how are the Mexica doing it differently? Many Mexica are members of a Kalpulli, the Aztec term for a self-governing local group or community (Ricard 1966: 25) which gives a certain structure to their lives. The Kalpulli usually has a head (or Tlatoani) who makes most of the decisions (the Mexica tend not to be interested in democratic structures) and the members attempt to live their lives in a manner that is as 'Aztec' as possible.13 Some live in communities while others live spread around the city. Many spend their working time fashioning artifacts, making pre-colombian musical instruments for sale, building te-mescals (Aztec steam baths), learning (or teaching) Nahuatl and studying other aspects of Aztec culture such as astrology which uses the 12 Although Mexico City is networked by social movements of this type: collective action aimed at gaining access to land, housing and services (Miguel Diaz Barriga 1996). 13 It is now more usual to use the term 'Mexica' to refer to the Aztec past, however here I am using Aztec to mean historical beliefs and processes as distinct from those practised by today's Mexica.</page><page sequence="9">28 Susana Rostas complexities of the pre-colombian calender to predict. Although they claim to want to reject the infrastructure of the capitalist world, most urban Mexica do not question their use of electricity, piped water and bottled gas (nor the watching of television). The more performative side of their practices, the dances, are also the more public. It is by means of these that the Mexica disseminate the message of mexicanidad to a wider audience. Besides dancing in the Zocalo, they also dance at other pre-hispanic sites. In the former, a dance can involve from 5 to 10 groups of Mexica, often intermixed with groups of Concheros. For the dances that the Mexica perform are those of the Concheros, a tradition that has existed for sometime.14 The Concheros perform a religious circle dance and hold all-night vigils: their religiosity is part Catholic and part indigenous. This dual heritage is visible in the clothing that they wear and the musical instruments that they play (Rostas 1996). Although the Mexica sing the same songs and play the same music, they stress that they are not Concheros, for they have stripped the Concheros' practices of any Spanish elements. The Concheros play a stringed instrument made from an armadillo shell, the concha, which the Mexica have rejected as being gauchupine (Spanish). They play only pre-Colombian instruments which are predominantly percussive: their music is thus more strident than that of the Concheros. Where the Concheros' way of dancing emphasizes 'ritualization', that of the Mexica lays much more stress on 'performativity' (Rostas 1998a): for while the Concheros dance to achieve at-one-ment (atonement) with a Christian God, the Mexica claim that their dance is to get in touch with, or recreate the various energies of those entities that have been 'falsely' called deities. The Concheros' dance ideally consists of a balance of men and women who perform in 'union', while the dances of the Mexica usually have more male than female performers. Flamboyance is encouraged and dancers are highly competitive one with another (Rostas 1998a). Although often the Concheros attract a crowd, they dance not to be watched, for their dance is a spiritual one, concerned with inner states of being. The Mexica on the other hand are primarily dancing to 'make a show'. They have truncated many of the preliminaries of ritualization that the Concheros follow. They do not say prayers nor enable a sense of community before they dance; for the mode in which they ask permission to dance is an exercise in individual prowess, rather than a sequence of movements requesting permission of 14 Some claim the Concheros dance started at the turn of the century during the early period of indigenismo, others that it was an off-shoot of Mexican Independence in the 1820s, others again that the present form of their dances are Aztec and that they were carried out in secret for several centuries (cf Rostas 1991, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="10">'Mexicanidad' 29 the deities which leads to harmonious interdependence. Nor do the Mexica present themselves to the four winds (las aninias con quistudores de los cuatro vientos), which although clearly not Catholic are not considered to be pre-Conquest either. If they have any religion, it is an ongoing reconstruction of Aztec beliefs and practices (excluding human sacrifice which the Mexica deny occurred) that feed into a form of nationalism that has millenarian undertones: theirs is the heady religiosity of proto-nationalism. The places where they dance are also usually used as sites for the dissemination of information. In the environs of a dance, there will be a range of items on sale which attract the interest of, for example, rural families visiting Mexico City, who as yet know little about their Aztec past. These items range from objects of use such as dance artifacts, small drums and pipes, to natural crystals and 'power' stones, as well as second hand books on themes of interest to the Mexica, photocopies of significant literature and various journals including possibly Ce-Acatl (about which I say more below). The pursuit of mexicanidad is not just one of the many aspects of any one Mexica's life, something to be followed in her but more generally his spare time, but an ontology, a way of being that informs their whole life. The Mexica seem to attend as many dances as possible and often dance not only with their own group but also those of others and with groups of Concheros. Although increasingly, Conchero events are being restricted to Saturday and Sunday, so as not to interfere with the working week, the Mexica seem to be reversing that trend. A dance at the weekend in some small town outside Mexico City, may be followed midweek by one outside a monastery in the City, held by invitation of that order: previously a Conchero event but now increasingly dominated by Mexica dancers. The Mexica distinguish themselves from the Concheros not only by the way that they dance but also by their clothing. Where the different groups of Concheros wear a range of styles made from many different materials, some of which cover the body more than others, the Mexica aim to use only materials available before the Spanish conquest, natural not dyed feathers for their headdresses, snake skins (or other leathers) for their clothing rather than plastic gold and/or silver trim: the overall designs being based on depictions in the codices. Many grow their hair and wear it tied at the back (imitating the Aztec warrior who had not yet taken captives), but letting it loose when they dance. Most Mexica have adopted Nahuatl names in preference to their Spanish ones, such as Tecpancalli, Cuauhtemoc and Metzli (mentioned above). As indicated they signal their difference not only by means of a clothing code but also linguistically: many aim to converse entirely in Nahuatl at some future</page><page sequence="11">30 Susana Rostas date, but they all now exchange greetings and use idiomatic expressions in that language. The journal Ce-Acatl, is a good guide to the diversity of interests and beliefs that the Mexica hold, while also being indicative of the face that they want to show to the public. Published every 20 days, according to the Aztec calendar, it has appeared regularly since November 1990, and reports on and advertises the activities of mexicanidad. Calling itself the journal of Anahuac culture, it aims to redeem the culture of 'nuestros antepasados', 'not as a museum object to be collected and placed behind glass but in order to know it and recreate it on a daily basis' (Editorial Ce-Acatl 1991.1: 3 (my translation)). Ce-Acatl has recently been increasingly concerned with the wider issues of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas but more particularly in the area of Anahuac. Usually defined as the central plateau (Ricard 1966: 25), one contributor to Ce-Acatl declares that Anahuacan culture is that which developed throughout 'the length and breadth of Aridamerica (meaning presumably the northern states of Mexico and the southern States of the USA) and Mesoamerica and as far as Nicaragua [or] Nican-Anahuac' (Mazatzin 1993: 4). Early issues of the journal (1991) were concerned with cultural recovery in a historical sense.15 In 1993, two articles challenging the truth about human sacrifice were published (Hassler 1993: 3). The Mexica, amongst no doubt others in Mexico, clearly feel that a phenomena so horrible to our present day sensibilities could never have occurred. Much of that issue is however taken up with two habitual sections. The central one is based on pertinent newspaper cuttings on various topics - which range from archaeological zones, to indigenous medicine and health, education and culture, the ethnic situation and rights for indigenous peoples. There are also international news items, about Guatemala for example, from which it is clear that the working definition of today's Anahuac in fact corresponds to what we now know as the Nation State of Mexico! The second section gives an indication of the kinds of facilities and cultural/social events available to those interested in mexicanidad which range from conferences (the 7th International Congress on Traditional Medicine) to ceremonies such as 'Huizilopochtli Tlacatiliztli', performed for the winter solstice which is associated with the birth of Huitzilopochtli. But it also gives information on various Kapulli, such as the Kapulli Moviemiento Sexto Sol which gives classes in Nahuatl Philosophy, Calenders, cosmic vision, 15 The first issue is devoted to a series of articles on eclipses (a total eclipse was due very auspiciously on July 11th 1992 and Cultural Centres in towns and villages throughout Mexico were particularly asked to make arrangements to prepare for and be receptive to this cosmic event).</page><page sequence="12">'Mexicanidad' 31 astronomy, mathematics and dance. Many other groups also offer dance classes16 or classes in Nahuatl: there are 13 possibilities listed. Other attractions are workshops in theatre and dance; classes in indigenous writing at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia y Historia and much more besides.17 Specific articles on mexicanidad (or aspects of Anahuacan culture that are relevant to it) are not as frequent as might be expected. One article discusses the 'levels of the dance Azteca Chichimeca', which seems to be confounding the Aztec terms for different kinds of dance, with different aspects of the same dance.18 Issue 67 has an article on the origin and meaning of the word 'teotl'. Usually translated as 'god': this is however a gloss that the Mexica strongly resist. For many of them 'teotl' signifies rather 'energies': the different Aztec deities being seen as de-personalized manifestations of different forms of energy. Huizilopochtli is not then the deity who at the time of the Spanish Conquest demanded frequent human sacrifices in order that the sun would rise every day, but rather an abstract force. As the Mexica point out, the images, whether sculptural or in the codices, that have survived of the so-called deities are not fully anthropomorphic but represent rather powerful 'abstract' entities.19 According to one writer (Linares Aguirre 1995: 5-7), the word 'teotl' denotes 'marvellous', 'magnificent', 'unforseen' but not god. He points out rather patronisingly that only too frequently the followers of mexicanidad do not work hard enough at getting to the roots of Nahuatl words and often invent ceremonies, terminology, greetings and names while still thinking in the Spanish or European way (as e.g. Nican Anahuac, above, which is said to mean 'hasta aqui el Anahuac' (trans: as far as here Anahuac) (Mazatzin 1993: 4)). He finishes with a proto nationalistic exhortation: 'Mexihco es raiz, es unico y es nuestro. 16 variously called chitontiquiza, danza mexika chichimeka, or danza Azteca. 17 Later issues have a greater proportion of articles on social issues related to the indigenous peoples of 'Anahuac'. The last issue I have (No 69, 21 April 1995, post the Chiapas uprising) is devoted almost entirely to articles on politics rather than culture. 18 Mazatzin 1994 but see Rostas (n.d.) where I suggest that technically or historically, rather than being different levels of the same dance, these are terms for different kinds of dance that existed either prior to the arrival of the Spaniards or were subsequently introduced. 19 Rather surprisingly on the www (from California), Ometeofi is described as the Nahuatl (Mexica) name for the one God (although God it is pointed out is an English word) and the elements of water, earth, air and fire (Tialoc, Tezcaflipoca, Questzalcoatl and Huizilopochtli) as different manifestations of Ometeotl. Reinforcing, I would have thought, the Christian notion of a single omnipotent deity (Olin Tezcatlipoca 1996).</page><page sequence="13">32 Susana Rostas Luchamos por nuestra esencia antigua, no por la disfrazada...' (Mexico is the origin, is unique and is ours. We must struggle for our antique essense, nor for its disguised [form]) (Linares Aguirre 1995: 7). But what exactly is the ideology behind mexicanidad? Is it a clear cut one? It appears to be not only invented but also plural. Every adherent of mexicanidad has his (or her) idea of what should be emphasized. Many Mexica see themselves as warriors for the future who need to fight to get back not only Anahuac but, for those Mexica now living in the United States, Aztlan as well.20 'Our heritage must be reclaimed: we must declare again and again that we are the true owners of the lands of Anahuac and Aztlan. We must work and struggle and take our lands back under our control' (Olin Tezcatlipoca 1996: 3). Some claim that Nahuatl or Uto-Aztecan was the stem-language spoken not just in Central Mexico and the Southern United States but in the northern United States and South America as well. As already indicated many Mexica are intensely and almost irrationally nationalistic: 'Mexica! Wake up! Where are our warriors! Mexica men and woman defend our people! Our Mexica future is waiting for us! Mexica knowledge and courage will free our people!' (Olin Tezcatlipoca 1996). Other authors, however, address the problem of plurality. One writer suggests that the spirit of the cultural synthesis of the Mexica people is the basic principle of mexicanidad: a form of survival (Mazatzin 1993: 4-5). He claims that 'our' ('nuestra') movement envisages the emancipation of all Mexicans, whether descended from indians or not and the 'demystification of mestizaje', a European creation 'to belittle the indian race'. He emphasizes that the Mexica, as a nation must reject the occidental project of the nation state which does not give the right of self government to the plurality of ethnic groups. 'Mexicanidad proposes the emancipation of all peoples that make up the Mexican nation for the construction of an appropriate national project, where all can themselves construct their destinies in the plurality' (ibid). But is there any sign that this is what mexicanidad is achieving? Admittedly it is early days yet, but in my experience the Mexica are often not particularly perspicacious individuals. They have been described by one writer as fanatical (Anzaldo Meneses 1990, 1993) and by another as Aztec imbeciles - 'imbeciles aztequicantes' (Luis Gonzalez de Alba quoted by Anzaldo Meneses 1993). Although individually they propound (and theoretically envisage) a future of brotherly love and cosmic harmony, in fact they seem to have little tolerance for the ideas of others. When, for example, some Mexican Buddhists were encountered performing ceremonies on dates of astronomical significance for 20 The area in the Southern States of the US in which the cave from which the original founders of the Aztec empire migrated, is thought to be located.</page><page sequence="14">'Mexicanidad' 33 Buddhists at Teotihuacan, there was an unpleasant confrontation. The Mexica chased them off, claiming that they, as the proponents of mexicanidad, could be the only true guardians of the site (Anzaldo Meneses 1993). They increasingly use archaeological sites for their ceremonies, occupied Teotihuacan in the Summer of 1995 and made it difficult for tourists to enter and would like to take such sites over altogether. A proposal was raised at the Third Anahuac Congress in 1991, to at the very least allow free entrance for 'indigenous' Mexicans and to increase the entry fee for outsiders (Ce-Acatl 1991: 16, p. 28). But they are also intolerant of each other: there are many fights not only between groups at dances and thus in the public domain but also within groups, which are clearly power struggles over not only meanings but inter-group politics. Mexicanidad is fluid, it is not a movement with much structure. What holds groups of Mexica together is the charismatic character of their leaders linked to hierarchical manipulation and idealism about an imagined future. Overall mexicanidad lacks a sense of social unity (De la Pena Martinez 1993). Proto-N ationalism Writers and intellectuals tend on the whole to be disparaging of the Mexica and to imply that they are merely fanatics who are 'playing': that their movement constitutes some sort of cultural noise and is mere 'ethno-escapism'.21 A recent science fiction novel suggested a scenario whereby, by the year 2045, an Aztecan revival will be in full swing. Not only will the religion of mexicanidad be vying for hegemony with various Protestant sects, attempting still to hold sway over their converts from behind the Tortilla Curtain (the border with the United States), but Mexico City will once again be called Tenochtitlan. At its centre, at least, this will be a high-tech city, of complex buildings, phone screens and weapons (such as the zumbador which injures by means of sonic waves: very necessary to counter the guerilla tactics of the various opposing groups). Most people will be speaking a slanguage, Espanahuafi, part Spanish part Nahuad, and human sacrifice will be on the increase (Hogan 1992). This is a suggestive novel, but does its scenario just poke further fun at the Mexica or can it seen as a perspicacious indication that 21 To outsiders what the Mexica are up to might well be seen as escapism. I am here extending Appadaurai's 1990 terminology, of the various 'scapes' ('techho', 'ethno' and others scapes) which make up any society and which are becoming increasingly more similar worldwide (Appadurai 1990), to imply that there will possibly be an increasing need to escape from the 'scapes', to create another reality which in the case of the Mexica can perhaps be seen as largely theatrical.</page><page sequence="15">34 Susana Rostas the Mexica, as the younger generation who are 'buscando su camino en la vida' (looking for their path in life) do have something to say about Mexico's future? That perhaps mexicandidad will go on growing and has the potential to become sufficiently culturally significant to provide a social input for the future of Mexico (see Lomnitz-Adler 1992). As currently constituted, mexicanidad certainly does nothing to alleviate the social ills of life at a physical level in Mexico City, nor have the Mexica ever had much interest in rural indigenous peoples: as City people they on the whole have a dislike of the countryside. To visiting foreigners it may even seem like 'exoticization', connected with tourist interests (Urban &amp; Sherzer 1992:11). But to its proponents mexicanidad is far from folkloric: (* I am not here using the term in the way it is used by Mendoza, BLAR Vol 17, No 2) mexicanidad provides a nexus for action which is purposeful for those involved, even though the activity at present is more about the representation of indianity than the actuality of resistance and political empowerment (which seems to be more on the agenda of USA mexicanidad, where 'ritual, ceremony, and dance', not to mention 'superstition and other diversions' are described as keeping 'us from being the true warriors of our people' (Olin Tezcatlipoca 1996: 9). The pursued goals as currently stated are probably unrealizable but as Melucci has indicated perhaps the meaning of the action should be looked for in the action itself, rather than in the stated goals (Melucci 1985: 801). Although to the Mexica, what they are doing seems possible, realizable and certainly serious, to outsiders I would suggest that what they are creating is seen as e-scapes from the -scapes, as mere re presentations of what are already representations (of the Aztec past); the creation of an actual virtual reality! But representation (or a representation) is always a first step in any political process and should not be undervalued. The Mexica may not be taken seriously yet, but the foreign media have noticed them and see them as an important aspect of what currently typifies Mexico; photos of them appear in guide books, in serious historical films on the Aztecs and they are mentioned in discussions on how globalization is affecting Mexico.22 For those who are members of mexicanidad, by dancing as Mexica they are making themselves 'different'. This difference is not one of ethnicity in its usual sense but rather of an imagined or assumed identity, by means of which they are able to say that they see themselves as of significance (at least to themselves). Although the Mexica claim that they want to reject the capitalist project and do not want to be counted as members of the nation state as it exists today, in part the question I have been begging in this paper is 22 As for example, Radio 4, Feb-March 1997, where the sound of their drums in the Zocalo was in evidence in the background.</page><page sequence="16">'Mexicanidad' 35 whether the Mexica are not being as nationalistic as many Mexicans, if not MORE so, involved as they are in a subculture that foregrounds 'nationhood'. Although they claim to be presenting a project that rejects State authority, and religion as currently constituted, if anything they are reinforcing its underpinnings, the re-evaluation of the Aztec past (so important to the State's indigenismo of the 1920s). They do this not only by means of their rhetoric but as they dance in the Zocalo outside the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City. That they perform here is perhaps also an indication that the government in power23 realizes the significance of this aspect of nationhood to a growing number of Mexicans and will be appropriating it, if they have not already done so.24 Finally then, mexicanidad is perhaps better seen as a subculture, a form that expresses, 'a fundamental tension between those in power and those condemned to subordinate positions and second class lives' (Hebdige 1979: 132). Subcultures are after all forms of resistance that challenge the social order symbolically but whose resistance is overcome 'by an expansion of the dominant order' to incorporate with time their ever transforming styles and/or practices (Lomnitz Adler 1992: 320 footnote 24, Hebdige 1979:133, Hall 1976, Scott 1990).
