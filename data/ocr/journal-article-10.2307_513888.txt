But so much of Quarles's better writing is informed by the same idiom and attitude of mind he brought to Emblemes, that it is perhaps in Dr Holtgen's examination of the whole emblem convention that his largest achievement must lie. No critic has previously published so thorough an investi- gation of the background to Emblemes in Christian iconography, Ramist philo- sophy, and the European intellectual context in general. Although it is well known that Quarles's two acknowledged sources, Pia Desideria and Typus Mundi, are Jesuit works, correspondences between the Society's meditational practice and the over-all structure of Emblemes are closely traced for the first time. Quarles's early biblical paraphrases, such as A Feast for Wormes (I620), have too often been seen as uninspired narrative ramblings typical of a trite literary fashion of the time. By relating the 'Meditations' of the paraphrases and the categories of Ramist logic, Dr Holtgen has rightly shown that the paraphrases constitute the early preparation, no matter how unwittingly undertaken, for the discipline which Quarles found so precisely suited to his talents in Emblemes. The coming of the Civil War confronted Quarles with a dilemma which was to be a commonplace: he had a deep sense of loyalty to the crown and a reverence for the divinely appointed person of the king, yet his upbringing would have inclined him toward the Parliamentarians. He was not a profound political and doctrinal thinker, but his work as a pamphleteer demands analysis. Dr Holtgen gives a lucid account of the comments Quarles makes in the political pamphlets, and particularly in The Loyall Convert (I644). One might only wish that he had deployed his great knowledge of the period and of contemporary allusions to give a firmer characterization of Quarles's position. Dr Holtgen's scholarship is accurate, judicious, and wide-ranging. This is a magisterial performance by Germany's outstanding Renaissance Anglist.

Since, as Dr K6ppl acknowledges, a good deal of work has been done on Herbert's posthumous reputation, perhaps the main value of his study of the reception of Herbert's poetry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries lies in its extensive quotations. Dr K6ppl's method is not to collect every known allu- sion to Herbert and his poetry, but rather to indicate how he was regarded by</page><page sequence="2">means of the narrower but ultimately more illuminating lens provided by trans- lations, paraphrases, and commentaries. After placing Herbert in the general context of metaphysical poetry, Dr Koppl begins with James Leeke's Latin versions of 'The Church Militant' and 'Good Friday', preserved in manuscript in Durham Chapter and Cathedral library. The illustration is substantial, the commentary limits itself largely to general remarks on Leeke's florid rhetoric and anti-Roman Catholic emphasis and, perhaps for reasons of space, undertakes little detailed comparison between the Latin version and its original. There follows a brief characterization of English Puritanism introducing an examination of Herbert's standing with the Puritans in general and with Baxter in particular, where Herbert's reverence for the Bible, his concern with self-examination, and his repudiation of wanton stylistic elaboration gave him a powerful appeal. Then comes the heart of the study, George Ryley's manuscript commentary on The Temple. This, of course, has been discussed by previous writers on Herbert's reputation, and has been edited as a doctoral thesis, but it is not generally accessible and the extensive quotations from it are to be welcomed, although the fact that the main text is in German is bound to limit the usefulness of this presentation. The book con- cludes with a survey of Herbert's treatment-and frequent mutilation-at the hands of other eighteenth-century writers. The work is expanded to half its length again by ponderous notes and a long and over-elaborate bibliography (surely the original and revised versions of Martz's Poetry of Meditation do not need separate entries), both of which could with advantage have been pruned in favour of an index. It is a moot point whether a study of an author's posthumous reputation gives a greater insight into his own work or into changes in literary taste. Cer- tainly in this case one is for the most part struck as much by what writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries missed in Herbert's work as by what they found. With Herbert's music, his marvellous representation of inner discord and harmony in the movement and cadence of his verse, they appear to have been quite out of tune; to his ironies and ambiguities they were largely deaf. What is more, although it is salutary to be reminded that the traditional view of Herbert as the representative Anglican is largely Walton's invention and requires considerable modification, it is striking that his many admirers at the Puritan end of the religious spectrum could so far disregard the centrality in his work of the eucharist. But if the twentieth-century critic brings to Herbert a critical sophistication far beyond that of the authors with whom this study deals, it is arguable that they in an important sense took Herbert more seriously. What emerges most strongly is their sense of his useful piety, the direct applicability to the business of living of his promotion of the virtues of humility, reverence, seemliness, charity, and so on. For all our enhanced appreciation of the textual richness of Herbert's poetry, those earlier writers were closer to the true spirit of the poet in their readiness to endorse the qualities he celebrated than is the modern critic preoccupied with the skill with which he did it. The modern tendency to approach poetry too narrowly has compromised the 462 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="3">traditional equilibrium of teaching and delight. The doctrine of the intentional fallacy encourages the modern reader to neglect if not ignore what for earlier writers was the primary justification for writing at all. If we praise the verbal details of the Arcadia, The Faerie Queene, or Pope's Moral Essays without experiencing effectual moral enlightenment we are perhaps missing the wood for the trees. Herbert would certainly have thought so. The concern of Herbert's eighteenth-century readers with content as against form is reflected in their readiness to tamper with Herbert's poems. Selecting the points of doctrine, edification or morality they wished to inculcate, they had no hesitation in simplifying imagery, trivializing rhythms and stanza forms, or even omitting stanzas altogether in a way that would seem sacrilegious to a modern critic who might nevertheless reject the religious beliefs Herbert was aiming to communicate. For all their enthusiasm for Herbert, the great majority of the writers included in Dr K6ppl's study are obscure figures whose very obscurity implies that at least for most of the eighteenth century Herbert was regarded as of only peri- pheral interest. All that has of course changed, and the poet has now been honoured by a journal devoted entirely to his work. No one objects to Herbert's acceptance as a soloist in his own right after so long playing second fiddle to Donne, but for all that one must give the George Herbert Journal no more than a cautious welcome. Encouraged as much by the tenure system in the United States as by the actual growth in literary studies, the highly specialized periodical at once promotes and battens on a narrowness of approach whose dangers may out- weigh its advantages. In this inaugural number, for example, Carole Vassner's 'Herbert and Wisdom Poetry' betrays a frightening assumption of ignorance of the scriptures. Miss Vassner points to Hutchinson's note on 'The Super- liminare' to Exodus 12: 22, and comments (p. I2) that 'Hutchinson fails to mention' the significance of the text. But to Hutchinson's generation such an explanation would have been supererogatory; as would Miss Vassner's main argument that Herbert probably knew and drew on Ecclesiasticus. A similar objection may be made to Robert J. Wickenheiser's 'George Herbert and the Epigrammatic Tradition'. Any reader with a good general knowledge of Renais- sance poetry should be aware of the high standing of the epigram in the period and able to give it its due weight as a formative influence on the writers of the time. In short, although such studies may have some value to an ignorant genera- tion, it is arguable that they foster that very ignorance by providing, whatever their intention, a substitute for, rather than an incentive to, that wide familiarity with the seventeenth century which is most conducive to the truly balanced appreciation of Herbert. Another danger is illustrated by the first article in the collection, Stanley Fish's 'Doing Scholarship: The Mystery of The Temple Finally Explained'. Had he observed the classic advice to keep his piece nine years he would have avoided the situation (like that of the entertainer who makes a succession of 'positively last appearances') of following a 'final' explanation within a twelve- month by another much fuller and more definitive. Built-in obsolescence REVIEWS 463</page><page sequence="4">already blights our material environment; it would be a pity if it were to invade the world of scholarship. The germ of Professor Fish's article attains full and impressive growth in The Living Temple. George Herbert and Catechizing, which marks a real step forward in our understanding of Herbert's poetry. The author begins by setting out some of the major divisions in the reading of Herbert, between the poet of assurance and reassurance and the poet of disquiet, between the poet of peace and the poet of struggle, between the poet of artifice and design and the poet of sincerity. As a way not of resolving but of holding these oppositions in a fruitful equilibrium he invokes the tradition of catechizing and Herbert's relation to it. At the heart of this tradition lay the image of a building (the temple) and in the very form of the word, with its dual implications of a continuing activity and an achieved state, he finds a parallel to the experience of Herbert's poetry, conveying as it does both a record of spiritual struggle and also a sense of resolution. He sees too in the progress of the catechumen, from his entry into the Church to final qualification for recruitment into the Church Militant, a rationale for the organization of the poems in The Temple. Furthermore, he shows how Herbert's unconventional approach to catechizing, in his rejection of rote-learning in favour of active participation in a process of genuine self-discovery, is reflected in the strategy of many of the poems, where, for example, a question is posed, an answer supposed, a different answer proposed, and the assimilation of the two answers to each other enforces an enlarged understanding of the implica- tions of both. Mr Fish's documentation of Herbert's acceptance of the tradition carries full conviction-it would after all have been more surprising had Herbert not sub- scribed to it-as does his analysis of how Herbert's unconventionally Socratic approach to catechizing is reflected in his poetic strategies. The danger in such a thesis, and it is one which this author does not altogether avoid, is to present it as the one thing needful to understanding rather than as a part of a whole complex of influences whose interaction produced the unique quality of Herbert's verse. For example, he argues that Herbert's theory of catechizing explains the presence in his poetry of order and unpredictability, design and surprise: rather than being a sincere report of a mind changing, the poem is a sincere effort on the part of the poet-catechist to change his reader-pupil's mind. Sincerity is thus not a bodiless interior phenomenon in relation to which a poem is merely a transcription; sincerity is inseparable from an intention in relation to which a poem (or some other act) is an implementation. (p. 26) This is excellently said, but it embraces not just catechizing but the whole tradition of Renaissance rhetoric, where the author's main intention must be assumed to be to bring about a certain state of mind in his reader-rather than to express what is in his own. Again, Mr Fish sees catechizing as the long-needed explanation of the apparent tension between work already done and work to be done, the simultaneous exis- tence of the perfect Temple in Christ and the constant need to build it in the heart of man. But is it not just this tension that lies behind the dual role of the REVIEWS 464</page><page sequence="5">knights in The Faerie Queene who at once embody and pursue the virtues they champion? Yet one could hardly argue that Spenser's is a catechistical work. Behind both cases, as indeed behind so much Renaissance thought and litera- ture, lies the Fall, a concept which Mr Fish nowhere discusses, with its implica- tion of a vision of a perfect world as God originally designed and created it and an awareness of the world as it actually is, giving rise to the Renaissance view that perhaps the foremost duty of men was to endeavour as far as possible to re-approximate the one to the other. All of which of course is not to deny the relevance of the catechistical tradition, rather to stress that it constituted but one element in a much larger scheme. Like so many authors with a case to argue, Mr Fish tries to make his key unlock more mysteries than it is capable of. He boldly tackles 'The Church Militant' which has proved an embarrassment to so many critics, sees in it the narratio of the catechistical tradition, and justifies both its position at the end of The Temple and its acknowledged shortcomings as poetry on the grounds that Herbert had to dismiss the reader with a strong sense of the imperfection of human achievement. But in tracing the narratio back to Augustine, to whom he suggests Herbert owed this feature, he notes that it formed part of the instruc- tion offered to those wishing to enter the Church. Within the organizational scheme for The Temple that Mr Fish has already proposed we should therefore expect the narratio to come at the beginning rather than the end. The proposi- tion that ' "The Church Militant" is Herbert's narratio, answerable in every way to the traditional formula' (p. 15I) is not as obvious as Mr Fish claims. Furthermore, in the section entitled 'The Aesthetic of the Unfinished' the argu- ment that it is incumbent on the poet to leave his work incomplete 'lest he appear to be claiming for it, and therefore for himself, more than any human agency is allowed' (p. i62) as an explanation of the anti-climacteric nature of 'The Church Militant' creates more problems than it solves. For one thing, a single inconclusive poem becomes a fairly empty gesture of human inadequacy if it comes at the end of a long series of highly wrought and beautifully completed poems. More important, Herbert knew perfectly well that his fruit was only flowers, that all human achievement is in itself imperfect and wholly dependent on divine power for whatever limited success it may attain-the majority of his poems after all demonstrate how God supplies human insufficiency. Deliber- ately to build incompleteness into one's work lest it should challenge the uniquely perfect creativity of God would be spiritual pride of the highest order. As Mr Fish himself says (p. i6o) 'one must do the best one can while believing that, unaided, one can do nothing'. We are faced here with one of the great paradoxes which the seventeenth century embraced and of which we fight shy, of man's absolute responsibility for his own actions, and absolute dependence on God, beautifully articulated in one of Donne's sermons where he asserts that the Christian must live with such spiritual strenuousness as if there were one and only one man to be saved, and he would be that one man, but at the same time live in such total assurance of God's mercy as if nobody could be damned. Here again the unique light that Mr Fish claims to be shed by the catechistical tradition in fact shines in for us during this period from many other angles. 30 REVIEWS 465</page><page sequence="6">One may take issue with some of Mr Fish's particular readings-his interpre- tation of 'Love III' almost smacks of antinomianism in seeing salvation as some- thing imposed rather than as something freely available to which one is invited- and one may question whether his approach is as all-sufficient as he claims; but there is no doubt that he has written a fascinating book which will enhance our understanding of much religious poetry of the period and certainly adds an important new dimension to our appreciation of George Herbert. C. F. WILLIAMSON The Politics of Landscape: Rural Scenery and Society in English Poetry, x63o-166o. By J. TURNER. Pp. xiv+238. Basil Blackwell: Oxford, 1979. i2z5o net. The concerns of this book carry it beyond its immediate subject-matter. I raise questions of the status of the literary text, of the structure of thought it reveals, and of its relation to class, culture and ideology. These are now hot issues. Structuralism and the renaissance of Marxism have challenged the theoretical feebleness of traditional literary studies, and a gulf has opened up between new theorists and practitioners of the older kinds of literary history, 'background' and the sociology of literature. I try, not to build a bridge, but at least to throw a line across. My conclusion attempts to draw a theory from my practice, and to look at recent critical models of the way literature operates in society. (p. xi) What a pity! The topic given in the title of the book is an important and relatively unstudied one, and ought not to have caused methodological palpita- tions. But what is needed is not only a thorough knowledge of topographia (which ought, however, to extend beyond topographical poems to include that great volume of topographical guides and impressions which had become an important genre in England since the Reformation and in which Dr Turner shows no interest-he does not appear to have used even Leland or Camden), but also a reasonable knowledge of English social history, and a general know- ledge of English intellectual history, of which these poems form one tiny part. The author is right when he says that his poets saw the landscape as a reflection of the human world, but they did not do so for the anachronistic reasons favoured in his commentary, but because their theological understanding of the harmony of the divine, the natural and the human worlds made such an equation a com- monplace. Seventeenth-century man's attitude to nature was fundamentally anthropomorphic. God had created nature to be exploited by man, to serve his needs, to teach him lessons. The century in fact witnessed, as Keith Thomas has recently argued, crucial changes of perception, with a more empirical and secular attitude-and a greater sense of man's responsibility for, and stewardship of, the natural world. None of this is perceived by Dr Turner. His book is, in short, myopic and under-researched. It falls into six chapters. The first discusses ideal forms of landscape in the art and poetry of the period; the second establishes the social and intellectual 466 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
