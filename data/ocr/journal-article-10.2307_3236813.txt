Ecology of North America consists of a preface, an intro- ductory chapter, nine chapters on the major biomes of North America (north of Mexico), a final chapter (11) on 'special environments', an appendix of common and scientific names of organisms mentioned in text, a glossary, and an index of subject matter and common names of organisms; scientific names are not used in the text. Literature citations also are not used, but a list of general and topic-specific references (many of them annotated by the author) are included at the end of each chapter. The book contains a sufficient number of (mostly good) black and white photographs from various sources and of extremely well done and informative diagrams by Tamara R. Sayre. Both types of illustrations add significantly to the instructional value of the book as a text for undergraduates. Bolen's goal in writing the book was to "...acquaint undergraduate students with the major ecological units in North America [north of Mexico] in a user-friendly format". His purpose was not to revise V.E. Shelford's (1963) book with the same title, but to present more or less the same material at an introductory level. Bolen's book is far less technical than the treatise by Shelford. It was written to serve as a text for sophomores majoring in biology and in related areas such as forestry and wildlife management. Ch. 1 briefly discusses terms and concepts such as succes- sion, climax, niche, latitude and species richness, and distribu- tion patterns of organisms, and Chs. 2- 10 deal with North American biomes and with special environments within a few of them. The biomes include: tundra, including a comparison of arctic and alpine tundras; boreal forest; eastern deciduous forest; grasslands-tallgrass, midgrass, shortgrass, and other grasslands - palouse, California, desert, Edwards Plateau; deserts; chaparral, including interior chaparral in Arizona, and pinyon-juniper woodlands; montane forests, including montane and subalpine zones and mountain parks and meadows in these zones; and temperate rain forest. Special environments dis- cussed in Ch. 11 include the everglades, caves, Grand Canyon, Atlantic tidal (salt) marshes, maritime live oak forests, kelp 'forests' of coastal California, and Florida mangrove thickets. Core subject matter covered in each of the nine chapters on ecological regions (biomes) includes climate, soils and land- scape, features and adaptations of plants and animals, and major types of communities (or associations). In addition, various other topics that fit well with a particular biome are discussed, e.g. tree line and forest tundra in Ch. 2; wolves and moose on Isle Royale, Michigan, and lynx (predator) snow- shoe hare (prey) population cycles in Ch. 3; mast, chestnut blight, and neotropical migrant songbirds in Ch. 4; Pleistocene megafauna extinction in Ch. 5; desertification in Ch. 6; nurse trees, yucca and yucca moths, giant saguaro and woodpeckers in Ch. 7; pinyon jays in Ch. 8; competitive exclusion in chipmunks, red squirrels, bears, and pine cones, and Yellow- stone fires in Ch. 9; and old-growth forests and bears, Pacific yew, and Mt. St. Helens in Ch. 10. Special attention is given to some of the major mammals, and sometimes also to other animal groups, in the biomes, e.g. lemmings and barren ground caribou in Ch. 2; red squirrels in Ch. 3; bison, pronghorns, and prairie dogs in Ch. 5 and marbled murrelets in Ch. 10. Thus coverage of topics is wide-ranging and will give the reader a good general sample of organism-environment interactions in the major biomes of North America. Each of Chapters 2 - 10 contains an outline map of North America showing the general location of the ecological region under discussion. However, while the US portion of the map shows locations of the major rivers, rivers are not shown on the Canadian portion. Further, with the exception of the map for chaparral and pinyon-juniper woodland in Ch. 8, which shows boundaries of states in which these vegetation types occur, and montane forests in Ch. 9, which shows the location of Mt. Whitney (California), Grand Tetons (Wyoming), and Pikes Peak (Colorado), the maps do not contain 'landmarks' other than major US rivers. State (USA) and provincial (Canada) boundaries would have enhanced significantly the teaching value of these maps. Except for the chapter on deserts, and to a lesser extent the one on temperate rain forest, pitifully little information is given on climate. It seems to me that since climate is the major determinant of the distribution of vegetation on a large scale, and thus of terrestrial biomes, it deserves considerably more attention than it received in this book. Graphs showing tem- perature and precipitation for each month of the year for (a) representative locality(ies) in each biome should be the minimum requirement here. Personally, I prefer the use of Walter-type climatic diagrams to represent climate. Likewise, soils are treated scantily, and Bolen uses a mixture of the old (e.g. Cherozem) and new (e.g. Mollisols) USDA soil classi- fication system terminology. Not even a soil profile is shown. Further, belowground ecology is ignored. There are a number of incorrect or misleading statements and of incorrect numerical conversions scattered throughout the book. For example, "...tundra soils seldom benefit from nitrogen fixation in the mycorrhizae [emphasis added] of leguminous plants." (p. 32); "per 2.5 ha (10 acres)" (p. 41); "Eastern hemlock is found throughout the eastern boreal forest" (p. 72); "15 kg/ha (6 lb/ac)" (p. 121); "136 kg/ha (55 lb/ac)" (p. 121); "51,800 km2 (24,000 mi2)" (p. 182); "These plants [ephemerals] are annuals, which live and complete their life cycle in just one year." (p. 248); and ".. .Ordovician and Silurian eras" [emphasis added] (p. 371). The 11 chapters are almost free of typos, but: floral not foral (p. 58); Oikos not Okios (p. 63); Adirondack not 316</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews I Adriondack (p. 72); calcareous, not calcarious (p. 155); and endangered, not engandered (p. 226). However, there are several typos/misspellings in the list of plants in the Appendix: Sagittaria lancifolia, not S. lanciforia; Taxodium distichum, not Taxodiuim d.; Bouteloua eriopoda, not B. eripoda; Redfieldiaflexuosa, not R. fleuxuosa; Euphorbia antisiphilitica, not E. antisephilitica; Phragmites australis, not P. austalis; Hilaria belangeri, not H. balangeni; Muhlenbergia montana, not Muhlengergia m.; Sitanion hystrix, not S. hystalk; and Acer macrophyllum, not A. macrophylum. And in the index: commensalism, not commensualism, and three valleys, not three valley. Bolen's treatment of North American vegetation is almost strictly qualitative, and as such he has covered the subject reasonably well. Personally, however, I would like to have seen data included on plant community composition, struc- ture, and dynamics, such as those in Figs. 5 - 6 and Tables 5 - 10. It seems to me that even at the sophomore level, graphs and tables on quantitative and developmental (i.e., succession) aspects of communities would be appropriate. Several clarifications need to be made regarding high elevation vegetation in the Appalachians. The map of the boreal forest (p. 66) might give the impression that the Appa- lachian Extension of the spruce-fir forest is a continuous "finger" of this biome, whereas, in fact, it occurs only as islands of boreal vegetation, on the highest peaks. Further, Fraser fir is a characteristic species of the Appalachian Exten- sion only in its southern portion (i.e. western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia). Northward, Fraser fir is replaced by balsam fir. The statement is made on p. 74 that, "Treeless sites known as 'mountain balds' spot the mountainsides below timberline in some forested regions of the Appalachians. There is no timberline in the southern Appalachians, and I do not think Bolen meant to imply that there is one; however, the sentence could be so interpreted. Bolen recognizes six of E.L. Braun' s (1950) forest regions as subdivisions of his Eastern Deciduous Forest (see map on p. 98): Northerr Hardwood (Hemlock-White Pine-Northern Hard- wood sensu Braun), Mixed Mesophytic, Oak-Hickory, Oak- Chestnut, Beech-Maple, and Maple-Basswood. The map shows the Southern Mixed Hardwood Forest to be distinct from the rest of the Eastern Deciduous Forest. Bolen's discussion of this matter is a little confusing. Thus, on p. 101 he states that the Oak-Hickory Association "...covers most of the Piedmont region from New Jersey to Georgia and then swings across the Gulf states and into east Texas..." It is not clear to me if this range description includes the Gulf Coastal Plain. My guess is that it does not. Further, on p. 107, he states that "...pine forests cover much of the area considered a part of the Oak- Hickory Association. (Note: some authors consider this veg- etation separately as 'Southern Evergreen Forest'). "Bolen appears to be saying that the Oak-Hickory Association may be the climax vegetation on the Southeastern Piedmont (Braun's Oak-Pine Region) and on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains (Braun's Southeastern Evergreen Forest Region). Further, no mention is made in the text of the composition of the Southern Mixed Hardwood forest climatic climax, typically dominated by American beech (Fagus grandifolia), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), oaks (Quercus spp.), and pines (Pinus spp., especially P. glabra) (see Batista &amp; Platt 1997and references cited therein). The area of the Mixed Mesophytic Association given by Bolen (West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and eastern Tennessee) is considerably less than that of Braun, who shows this vegetation type extending from western Penn- sylvania to northeastern Alabama. Further, Bolen does not include the area occupied by Braun'sWestern Mesophytic Forest Region in his descriptions of the various associations in the Eastern Deciduous Forest. Thus, essentially all of the vegetation of the Interior Low Plateaus Physiographic Prov- ince (sensu Fenneman, 1938), as well as that of a large chunk of the Mississippi Embayment Section of the Gulf Coastal Plain is not accounted for. Braun's map of nine forest regions within the Eastern Deciduous Forest would be a good addition to Ch. 4. There is no mention of any of the several types of rock outcrop plant communities (e.g., granite outcrops, limestone glades, shale barrens) within the Eastern Deciduous Forest Region, or of their relatively high number of endemic plant taxa. Thus, a good opportunity was missed to discuss ende- mism, and also primary (xerarch) succession. Further, no mention is made of the numerous endemic plant taxa in the southern Appalachians in general. On p. 166, Bolen leaves the reader with the impression that the Blackjack Oak-Post Oak Cross Timbers Region is re- stricted to northeastern Texas. Whereas, in fact, it extends from south and west of Dallas (thus not extreme northeastern Texas) through eastcentral Oklahoma to southeastern Kansas (Hoagland et al. 1999). Also, the Konza Prairie is in northeast- ern, not northwestern, Kansas. Further, vegetation of the 'Brush Country' of south Texas is not covered. I suggest that a discussion of this large area be added to Ch. 6 in a revised edition of Ecology, i.e., as a vegetation type 'related' to grasslands. In his discussion of adaptations of animals to the hot, dry desert environment, Bolen gives the reader the impression that metabolic waterper se is an adaptation to this environment (p. 236). Whereas, in fact, the adaptation(s) is(are) the behavioral, structural, and/or other metabolic features (e.g., production of concentrated urine) of the animals that conserve the metabolic water, which is produced via aerobic metabolism in all, not just desert, animals (and plants too!). On page 258, the statement is made that less water is available to plants in fine- than in coarse-textured soils in bajadas. Although this would be true after light rainfall fol- lowing a long dry period, it would not be true following a heavy rainfall or a large runoff that would bring the soils to field capacity; in which case, the fine-textured soils would contain more water available for plant uptake. This would be a good place in a revised edition of Ecology to discuss the so- called inverse texture law and plant distribution on fine- vs. coarse-textured soils in arid regions. In general, coverage of hard chaparral (California, Ari- zona) is good, but no mention is made of soft chaparral (Coastal Sage Scrub)per se. After discussing chaparral shrubs that regenerate after fire by sprouting, Bolen states that, "Other species of chaparral-forming shrubs regenerate from seeds scarified by heat... which cracks their covering and let in water..." (p. 278). This statement gives the impression that chaparral shrubs in general have water-impermeable seed (or 317</page><page sequence="3">3I Book reviews fruit, e.g., Rhus, Malosma, in Anacardiaceae) coats, but this is not the case. For example, dominant plant species in two of the chaparral communities [chamise (Rosaceae) and manzanita (Ericaceae)] he discusses do not have water-impermeable seed (or fruit) coats (Baskin &amp; Baskin 1998). Neither the Olympic, Cascade, nor Siskiyou-Klamath moun- tains are included on the map of montane forests in Ch. 9, and they are not discussed in the text. Yet, the vegetation of the Black Hills receives considerable attention. A discussion of these mountain ranges would have been a good place to cover vegetation and endemism of the ultramafic rock outcrop-soil complex of the Pacific Northwest, especially California. The map of the Temper- ate Rain Forest in Ch. 10 shows this vegetation type extending along the Pacific Coast from the Gulf of Alaska almost as far south as San Francisco Bay. Thus, it includes most of the Coastal Redwood Zone, and extends much further south than shown on some other broad-scale vegetation maps. For example, Kirk &amp; Frankland (1992) show this vegetation type extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. In Ch. 10, Bolen uses a minimum size of 1 m DBH and a minimum age of 200 yr as suitable standards for defining old-growth. This may not be sufficient for forests of the Pacific Northwest where this age is &gt; 200 yr. All this said, I still think Bolen has written an excellent book for introducing undergraduates to the biomes of North America north of Mexico. Thus, I recommend it for use as a text in courses that present a broad survey of the ecology of the USA and Canada. Such a course definitely would broaden the "...exposure [of undergraduates] to the natural world in which they live" . The book also would be an appropriate one for ecologists in other parts of the world to read for a general overview of the main vegetation types of the USA and Canada and of some of the interesting organism-environment interac- tions that occur within them.

Price USD 59.95. This unique volume details what is known of the vegeta- tion of the Pacific islands from New Guinea and western Melanesia to eastern Melanesia, Micronesia, the whole of Polynesia and Micronesia down to such remote islands as Pitcairn and Henderson. The Kermadecs and Cook Islands are covered but not New Zealand itself. Treatment is at the indi- vidual island level. The book is the culmination of the lifetime work of the two great Pacific botanists Dieter Mueller-Dombois and F. Raymond Fosberg. The length (733 pages) and number of references are monumental. The outline of the book was drawn up as long ago as 1935. In later years the authors came together four times a year to work on the book - until Ray's untimely death in 1993. I have been reviewing this book for some weeks because I keep on wanting to refer back to it, again and again, becoming submerged in the geology and botany of the different and legendary islands. Of course I am a Pacific island freak. But this book tells me everything I want to know about every one of those distant and remote specks scattered over the Pacific, most so small that they barely show up on maps and bear bizarre names. It is not often that a monograph is sufficiently lucid to be bedtime reading; it attests to the authors meeting their objectives of achieving an appropriate level of generali- zation. As a monograph, this volume is thoroughly up to date on geology, botany, archaeology, and human history of each island. Many islands, of course, were never adequately sur- veyed before the onset of anthropomorphic change. For many the field notes of Ray Fosberg, made during a brief wartime or later visit, are the only information available. Brought home is the incredible physiographic and botani- cal diversity of the Pacific islands, one of the world's great evolutionary centers. A couple of hundred excellent color photos (mostly 9 x 6 cm) provide the reader with a vivid exposure of the individual islands. One thus acquires a close acquaintanceship with remote Ducie Atol, where the only plant is Tournefortia, and the incredible richness and diversity of New Guinea, along with the archaic Gondwanan vegetation of New Caledonia. One learns of the biology of that beautiful strandline plant the Horsetail Casuarina, of the methods of dispersal of seaborne colonizers, the climatic conditions that cause mountain-top dwarfing, the edaphic basis of New Cal- edonian plant communities, the climatic basis of temperature and rainfall elevational zones, and of seasonality. On the debit side it is depressing to learn just how much anthropogenic change there has been throughout the Pacific. For example, the major Micronesian islands of Sapian and Tinian were largely converted to sugar cane by the Japanese, this change being superimposed on those earlier inflicted by the native antecedents. The authors do their best to deduce what original forests were like. Today coconut palms, breadfruit, mangos and other exotics (to name a few) grow in the lowlands of most islands. High rugged hinterlands may support sections, or vestiges, of the 318</page></plain_text>
