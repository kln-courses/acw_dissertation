<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION BRUNSCHVICG'S INTERPRETATION OF PASCAL When Leon Brunschvicgl died in 1944, a victim of the Nazis who had burned his books and manuscripts on entering Paris, French philosophy lost one of its greatest figures, a man who deserves to rank along with Henri Bergson and Emile Meyerson as one of the leaders of the generation just past. Perhaps because his works were not translated, he is nearly unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world. In addition, his point of view was opposed to the prevailing combination of evolutionary ethics and Aris- totelian metaphysics which is characteristic of some recent American thought.2 His leading theses may be stated as follows: 1. Aristotelian realism should have died once and for all in the seven- teenth century. To try to form a picture world like Aristotle's on the basis of modern scientific concepts is substantially trying to reduce modern mentality to the mental age of Aristotle, which was that of an eight or nine year old child.3 2. True idealism, which follows from the development of an ethic from the discoveries of science, demands an immanent rather than a transcendent conception of the best values that science suggests. "Every verified formula implies the certainty of a new truth which is yet truer."4 3. Methodologically, Brunschvicg proceeds in a historical-critical man- ner, drawing his ideas from a study of Xenophon's and Plato's Socrates, Plato himself, Montaigne, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, and Einstein. This was not an unusual procedure in his generation; witness Dewey's treatment of the history of ethics in Reconstruction in Philosophy (Holt '20). 1 For a short treatment of Brunschvieg, see Ernst von Aster, Geschichte der Philosophie (Leipzig, 1935), p. 410. The account by A. Lautman in L. Pierre- Quint, ed., Anthologie des philosophes franqais contemporains (Paris, 1931), pp. 345- 352, contains an analysis of Brunschvicg's principal works. See also Pmile Br6hier, Histoire de la philosophic (Paris n. d., 1933?), 11-2, pp. 1093-1095. Brunschvieg has written a statement of what he approves and disapproves in Les dges de intelligence (Paris, 1934). For biographical information see Lautman above, and the introduction by Robert Tenger in Brunschvicg, Descartes et Pascal: Lecteurs de Montaigne (N. Y., 1944); and when Brunschvieg retired to Aix-les-Bains after the Nazi entry into Paris, he restated his positions in an extremely compact fashion in Heritage de mots, heritage d'idkes (Paris, 1945). 2 Cf. for instance, the recent volume edited by Krikorian, Naturalism and the Human Spirit (N.

Such a study will yield as much about Pascal as about Brunschvicg, but it will show what he approved and disapproved in Pascal. In the best tradition of French scholarship, his treatment is conservative, and stresses many points rather well known. Such a treatment provides a good introduction to Brunschvicg's method of procedure as well as to show some of his leading themes. Most students from French secondary schools remember Brunschvicg as the editor of Pascal' and an acute commentator on Spinoza.' Just as for Alfred North Whitehead, the seventeenth century was for him the "century of genius."7 In addition, Brunschvicg believed that the great seventeenth century Frenchmen took their starting point from Montaigne in the previous century.8 Brunschvicg spent most of his life as an historical critic of ideas;9 and with the exception of his thesis,'0 his works are for the most part intensive historical criticism of thinkers and themes. He was a fine psychologist," studies his material exhaustively and in its own 5 Collection Grands kcrivains de France, 14 volumes (Hachette), edited by Brun- schvicg with the collaboration of Pierre Boutroux and Felix Gazier; Brunschvicg, ed.

After he wrote Les tapes de la philosophic mathematique (Paris, 1912), he commented on the reviews: "It has happened that we, have been classified, with a very kind intention, among historians of mathematics. We have every reason to decline such an honor.... Our task is not to know how the nature of things is made, but to tell how man's mind is made."

For readers not familiar with French educational practice, the agregation has been granted after university study to entitle the holder to teach in secondary schools; the doctorate is attained if at all about the age of 40 on presentation of an acceptable major and minor thesis, the latter of which has usually been in Latin. Brunschvieg's minor thesis was a study of Aristotle's syllogism: Ratione Aristoteles metaphysicam vim syllogismo demonstraverit (Paris, 1897). 11 In the French sense of getting at the meaning of an author through understand- ing his background, literary and social connections, and motives. Brunschvieg tries to "enter into the mind" of his author, as he said in his Spinoza (Paris, 1894), p. 63.. It will be remembered that Wilhelm Dilthey, Hegel and Lotze's successor at Berlin, called this kind of psychology "descriptive and analytic" as opposed to the ordinary, "explanatory and experimental" kind. Dilthey gave systematic expression and appli- cation of this psychology, which has been commonplace among French writers, to</page><page sequence="3">202 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH terms, but does not thereby forego critical attitudes. In addition, he was original and erudite; he handles literary, historical, mathematical, and scientific materials with equal confidence, and brings to all four broad scholarship and critical thinking.'2 For him, Pascal was a practical rather than a rational genius, interested in the specific and concrete. "Every difficulty had to be faced, and required for its solution the invention of a new procedure."'3 It is hard to discover from the school edition of the Pensees et opuscules and the 500th anniversary work, Le genie de Pascal, that Brunschvicg did not wholly approve of the man to whom he devoted a large part of his life. An examination of what he considered most important in Pascal, following the outline of the introduction to the Pensees et opuscules, will yield an overview of his opinion. He does try to understand and analyze his author, "enter into his mind," as he said of Spinoza. As a boy of 16 years,'4 Pascal made the first original contribution to the theory of conic sections since the Greeks, and four years later invented a calculating machine to help his father after the latter had aided, in the face of a popular revolt, in the collection of taxes as counselor to the royal intendant at Rouen. The machine worked, but was treated as a scientific curiosity, and did not, as Pascal hoped, bring him money. In the hands of men of administrative and business imagination, it might well have become the commonplace in accounting systems that calculators are today. And when his father's friend Petit became interested in raising sunken vessels, Pascal brought the same practical mind of the experimenter to bear on the problems of vacuum measurement when at the age of 24 he suggested thinkers after the Renaissance and Reformation in his Gesammelte Schriften, II, "Weltanschauungen und Analyse des Menschen seit Renaissance und Reformation" (3rd. ed., Leipzig, 1923). 12 The 14-volume edition of Pascal and the school edition represent critical studies in literature, his works on mathematics and causation cited in note 9 supra, his mathematical and scientific work, and the monumental Le progr~s de la conscience dans la philosophic occidental, 2 Vols. (Paris, 1927), his historical studies. Any one of these would constitute a life work for most men. He was one of the first to appre- ciate the importance of the new physics of Einstein and make it available to the cultured public; the little 29-page pamphlet, La physique du XXe si~cle et la phi- losophie (Paris, 1936), is a masterful presentation. 13 Le Genie de Pascal, p. 50; on his concrete geometry, "The geometry which Pascal practiced establishes a sort of direct relation between thought and its object," Spinoza et ses contemporains, p. 314. 14Descartes spoke scornfully of the youthful inventor of the calculating machine; he belonged to a different social set. One of the friends of Pascal's family, Roberval, was an opponent of Descartes. Roberval behaved in social conversation as though he were demonstrating a proposition from Euclid. Pensges et opuscules, p. 7. But in spite of Descartes's unfriendliness to Pascal, the latter saw in him the man who broke the long night of scholasticism and gave the critical impetus to modern science.

In considering the nature of a vacuum, Pascal's practical mind rejected both the anthropomorphic synthesis of the scholastics that "nature has a horror of a vacuum,"''7 as well as Descartes's "subtle matter."'8 To Brun- schvicg, this expert judging of facts puts Pascal in the great scientific tradition which leads through Leibniz, Kant, and Einstein; like Pascal, "to the sovereign authority of fact, Einstein sacrifices the rigidity of law."'9 This same keen observation and formulation of principles to accord with facts was characteristic of Pascal's method when he went into society for a single winter after the death of his father in 1654. The new science was in fashion; and some gentlemen took a trip to Poitiers with the young man whom the Chevalier de Mere, sixteen years older than Pascal, described as a "great mathematician, but knew only that, . . . had neither taste nor feeling, . . . often surprised us and made us laugh."20 His companions, and particularly the Chevalier de Mere, gave their young companion a good education on the heart, experience, instinct, subtlety and intrigue, social graces, "the mediocrity of the understanding and impotence of artificial rules," and a scorn for religious pretense.2' On a later trip to Paris, Pascal met another cultivated man of the world, Miton, who had no illusions about the vanities of society.22 A friend of Miton, du Vair, introduced Pascal to the Stoics and Epicureans; and the young experimenter came to know another realm than that of pure science,23 which he followed by reading Montaigne, and perfected his literary style by a study of the Socrate chretien of J. L. Guez de Balzac.24 And his eyes were opened still farther when the Chevalier de Mere proposed that he apply his ffiathe- matical genius to the study of chances on the roulette wheels in the salon of the Duc de Roanne. The result was the modern theory of probability.25 17 "Fragment d'un trait du vide," Pensees et opuscules, p. 74.

After his social fling, he broke with the world and made a definitive entry into the monastery, where he was to work, fast, and suffer from his illness, no doubt aggravated by malnutri- tion,28 until he died at the age of 36. But the same keen judgment and penchant for concrete applications and adjustment of principles to facts did not desert him there. Given the supernatural, and the authority of the Church in questions of morals, what should he conclude? The famous Pensees were notes made for the purpose of writing a definitive evidences of religion which was to be entitled The Apology for Religion.29 The Pro- vincial Letters30 were written to support the Jansenists of Port Royal in their controversy with the Jesuits. In mathematics, physics, social 'usage, and religion alike Pascal always insisted on a union of theory and concrete fact. For Brunschvicg, this is the essence of judgment. Pascal's method is in striking contrast with that of the scholastics and Descartes, and anticipates the work of Leibniz and Newton, as well as Kant's antimonies, which in turn foreshadowed Einstein.3' For the purpose of objective truth, "the whole succession of men, through the course of so many centuries, must be considered as the same man who subsists always and learns constantly."32 Like the recently discovered infinitude of starry space, truth is infinite; but truth comprehends "the two infinites which are present in everything: one of greatness, and the other of littleness"; or as we say today, the infinitely great and the infinitely small, the macro- physical and microphysical worlds.33 There can be no compromise between these principles on the one hand, and the universe of discourse of the 26 Pensees et opuscules, p. 120. 27 In spite of its flamboyant title, a good semi-popular account is Ren6e Fftl6p- Miller, The Power and Secrets of the Jesuits (Eng. tr., Garden City, 1929), pp. 100-122. 28 "Vie de Blaise Pascal," by his sister-in-law, Gilberte PWrier, Pensees et opuscules, pp. 14, 24. 29Ibid., p. 256. 30 Grands ecrivains de France: Pascal, V, VI, VII. 3 Brunschvicg's introduction to the Pensdes, Pensees et opuscules, p. 298; cf.

It is proper to insist that in the eyes of Pascal the pretense of covering, by the strength of the reason alone, the distance between the possible verbal and the possible real, does not just throw discredit on medie- val scholasticism, already discredited since the renaissance of true thought. It likewise renders suspect the wholly a priori cosmology of Descartes, who, it might be noted, had been the pupil of Pere Noel35 at the College of La Fleche. In 1648, when 'M. de Roberval36 undertook to push M. Descartes en- tirely off the deep end'37 one of the burning points of the debate was precisely the Cartesian thesis that makes matter, which exists physically, enter space, which exists mathematically. In addition, the letter in which Jacqueline tells about the visit made the year before by Descartes to Pascal,38 that they turned the argument of new experiments against the philosophy of the Principles.39 Pascal was no mere empiricist; the senses furnish us information, but not enough; the mind must be depended upon to unify thought; sense, mind, and the concept of space must all be brought to bear before we are able to "arrange our principles in the best order."40 Reason is therefore 34To an Anglo-Saxon, the "common sense" philosophy means the philosophy of the Scots which was so prevalent in America-before the days of William James. Cousin frankly derived from the Scots. Introduction to Pens6es, Pensees et opuscules, 292; for the influence of the Scots on Cousin, see Br6hier, Histoire de la philosophie, II-2, 656. 36 "The constitution of positive science has called to our attention the tacit but indefensible postulates on which what Pere Noel called, with a characteristic name, the common sense (sens common) of the physicists. This supposed common sense, which according to the scholastics at the beginning of the seventeenth century, represented everything that wisdom had accumulated since Aristotle, is, for our eyes of today, a tissue of beliefs that are not only false and fantastic, but very near to absurd. What is more contrary to genuine common sense (bon sens) for the par- ticular, which is real, than the inevitably deceiving general, or to consider a solid as more material than a fluid, water and earth as simple elements? . .. From the modern point of view, the world and perception, when brought back to itself, and when abstraction is made of every transcendent speculation which the realm of essences and forces superimposes on it, is a universe which is constantly escaping from itself in the discontinuity of its becoming."

Both the propositions that reason is everything and that reason is nothing are false; reason has the office of drawing consequences but it is confined to means.42 Pascal's experience with mathematics and physics on the one hand and of society on the other had taught him that neither the geometrical mind nor the society mind was capable of solving our human problems. On the one side there was Roberval, who always behaved in society as though he though he were demonstrating a geometrical proposition, and on the other l'esprit fin, the mind of keen, socially minded men like the Chevalier de Mere and Miton. Brunschvicg sees Roberval as a man with a mere geo- metrical mind and Mer6 as the man who knew his way about in society, the socially minded man.43 A man of the former sort is the product of education, he is "in the finest calling-in the world"; the latter is formed by experience with people. One cannot become a "gentleman"44 unless he is able to see and see clearly all social principles involved in any given social situation, and reason faultlessly on them. Pascal's ideal is that of a man who would combine both sorts of mind,45 who can meet and solve every practical difficulty both in mathematics and in society.46 In mathematics Pascal himself attained this ideal; here at least he was the man he wanted to be; "in no respect is the geometry of Pascal the intellectualized geometry of the algebrist; it is a geometry which concentrates on the spatial character of its object."4? In other works, Brunschvicg extends the esprit de finesse to include not only a combination of mathematical skill and experimental discernment, but practical and artistic judgment in addition to spatial relations: the genius of a poet, the critical acumen of a historian, the "flair" of an examining magistrate. Two literary critics, each examining the same poem, will give diverse interpretations. Mathematical judgment is completely unified; the jugement de finesse is only partially unified. But both are "intelligible."48 41 Ibid., p. 294. 42 Le genie de Pascal, loc. cit. 43 Note to Pens6e 1, Pensees et opuscules, p. 317. 44 Honne'te homme, an expression of Mer6 which in his time indicated a man who knew his way about socially, a "smart" or "big" man.

All men, even saints, wish to be happy; they desire universal pleasure. Thus as far as human desires are concerned, we are confronted with an infinite will to pleasure. On the scientific side an infinity of space,49 on the practical side the prin- ciple is infinite pleasure, "philosophy is not worth an hour of trouble"; either true or false pleasure will make the scientific infinite disappear in a twinkling.50 Geometry, when it turns us aside from life, can even be dan- gerous. The pettiness of the reality we experience in the life of reality, even when we reflect upon its details, and the infinite will to pleasure show us clearly how wretched man's state is. On the practical side as in the life given to science, we are between the infinitely great and the infinitely small; our world of experience is merely relative to both. Man's practical dilemma is just this: he is in the concrete, relative world, between the principle that guides knowledge and the principle that guides life; both principles reach up to an infinity of greatness and down to an infinity of smallness. Science is infinite in each direction; on the practical side we have an infinite will, which sometimes leans toward infinite pleasure, and sometimes to endless boredom and misery. So far as his intellect is concerned, man wants to believe in both the scientific infinite and the pleasure infinite. Unfortunately he cannot love the infinite; he loves only the finite.5" In this dilemma, skepticism is the only answer, or has at least beer the only answer given by ancient philosophers52 and moderns like Montaigne;53 the last word is Pyrrhonism. But we have the recourse of Christian faith. Pascal is a skeptic when confronted with man's dilemma, but he ceases to be a skeptic when confronted with the God of history, the "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."54 To a man of the twentieth century, this stamps Pascal as a "fundamentalist." But we must always remember that he was a seventeenth century man. Pascal was accustomed to think in opposites;55 on the one side for example the infinite and abstract, on the other the finite and concrete, either "truth without pleasure or pleasure without truth."56 For man, this problem is 49"The eternal silence of those infinite spaces frightens me."

This union must be realized in actual practice; in the realm of speculative truth such realization is impossible. And since natural will cannot make it possible, Pascal turned to historic Christianity for the solution. In the matter of religion, reason does not apply; it is enough to read the sacred books and bow to the authority of the Church. The contra- diction is natural but the solution is supernatural. Confronted with science on the one hand, and historic Christianity on the other, he judged for religion. Brunschvicg has no doubt that Pascal, as a fundamentalist, accepted the supernatural and miracles without reservation. Wretched man, the prisoner of his finite world, can be saved only by grace through Jesus Christ.8 Man's only escape from skepticism and the satisfaction of his infinite will to pleasure is to transport himself to a state of infinite pleasure and have habit, through discipline, fix that state in him. Religious truth is of a different order from human truth;59 armed only with his intelligence, man is without resources. Montaigne is right about man's essential wretchedness; "however fine the comedy of all the rest may be, the last act is bloody; throw dirt on his head, and there he goes forever."60 "In geometry, it is enough to add the finite to the finite to reach the infinite; here the finite is the opposite of the infinite."'" The historic truth of Christianity plus miracles such as the one which cured Marguerite P6rier, Pascal's niece, of an eye ulcer, are the facts with which we work. Man is made for eternity, not for abstract philosophy.62 "The mystery of divine election takes place in the uncertainty of judgment, across an infinite play of fluctuations and alternatives."63 " 'God makes the uncertainty of judgment weigh on the destiny of a Christian, allowing him only to glance at it'; in the idea of a miracle, the secret of election replies in terrible fashion to the persecution which the just man must suffer in and through the Church."64 To attain the blessedness of election if he is to attain it at all, man must completely subjugate his will.65 57Brunschvieg again refers here to Pascal as anticipating Kant. Ibid., 298. 58 This is of course the Augustinian tradition which was adopted by the Jansenists. Cf. also Brunschvieg's dictum on Pascal's study of the infinite and his application of it to theology. "The incomprehensibility of mathematical speculation on the in- finitely great and on the infinitely small is of the same order as the incomprehensi- bility of original sin or redemption."

We must believe in continuous redemption. The order of charity is higher than that of flesh. Again Pascal turns to biblical history, "Jonah and Daniel are witnesses of Jesus Christ, for they carry man into a realm which is above the order of mind and which contradicts the order of mind as the order of mind contradicts the order of the flesh; above the flesh and the mind there is charity which has its principle and end in God."67 Fantasy and cupidity are the opposites of charity. Pascal's views on charity were subjected to considerable criticism by the sisters at Port Royal, who saw in his vigorous polemic against the Jesuits in the Provincial Letters a lack of the charity he professed. Pascal replied that indulgence and complaisance were sins against true love.68 The opposition between science and religion goes even farther. Science stands for public truth, "the whole course of humanity appears as one man," but in religion and moral truth, Pascal stands for the solitary man, working out his salvation in fear and trembling.69 In the scientific realm we have made an idol of truth. Grace comes to the solitary man only. Brunschvieg implies elsewhere, though he does not name Pascal in the connection, that this constant listening to the voice of the mind "paralyzes man in an attitude of passive obedience and respect."70 Brunschvieg opposes the nominalist and pragmatist interpretation of Pascal's religion by 0116-Laprune and William James. When the Church condemned the five propositions of Jansenius, Arnauld and Nicole, the leaders at Port Royal,7' took the pragmatist attitude and attempted, in view of the practical consequences and in the interest of the monastery, to distinguish between a question of right and a question of fact. Pascal failed to see how truth could ever compromise with consequences. "It is a de- plorable thing to see men deliberate about means and never about ends."72 "If an expression found in an author is not susceptible of being given an intrinsic meaning, independent of the fancy or intelligence of such and such an interpreter, if there is never anything but individual thoughts in the face of reality, all equal to each other and having the right to retreat 66 Loc. cit. 67 Le progres de la conscience, I, p. 157. 68 Ibid., I, p. 184; cf. 12th Provincial Letter and Pens6e 582. 69 Brunschvieg, Introduction a la vie de l'esprit (Paris, 1900), p. 140. 70 Pens6es et opuscules, pp. 298-302. 71 In Heritage de mots, heritage d'idees, p. 39, quoting Pens6e 921, "When saints quibble, they find themselves charging their best actions as criminal.

'We could no longer say that any doctrine was either Catholic or heretical.... We should everywhere scatter facts and quibbles, everywhere darkness and misunderstanding.'73 Brunschvieg's introduction to the Pensees treats Pascal's fundamentalist religion at length. He reserves judgment both in that work and in Le genie de Pascal, and does not state his own opinion. In both volumes and in many other places in his works, he is the psychologist who is trying to "enter into the mind" of his author. But when he speaks in La raison et la religion (Paris, 1939), of Pascal's fine scientific mind bowing to the darkness of the faith,74 it is apparent that in religion he is the critic rather than the follower of Pascal, Likewise, Kant's linking of obligation and duty to a future life sacrifices the unity that obligation requires.75 And in another work he charges Pascal with being preoccupied with "survival of his being, by psychic immortality, rather than with the moral destiny of humanity."76 It is evident that Brunschvieg rejects the supernatural side of Pascal. A word must be added with reference to Brunschvieg's attitude toward Descartes. A superficial reading of his strictures on Descartes's lack of experimental ability might lead to the conclusion that Brunschvieg did not admire the father of analytic geometry. This is far from being the case.77 Socrates,78 Plato,79 Descartes, and Kant are all significant philosophers. Except Plato, Descartes80 is the greatest rationalist of all time; and brought the world back to the mathematical and scientific unity which Plato reached in the Parmenides and the seventh book of the Republic and taught in the Academy, and which we lost under the influence of Aristotle.8' The concrete 73Ibid. 74 La raison et la religion, p. 132; cf. Spinoza et ses contemporains, pp. 311 f. 75 La modality du jugement, p. 210. 76 Les ages de intelligence, p. 149. 77 "None of the scientists who criticized the metaphysical work of Descartes had brought anything to the public which could even from afar be compared with the amplitude, the coherence of the Cartesian work." L'exp6rience humaine et la causality physique, p. 240; cf. Spinoza et ses' contemporains, p. 307. 78 Not only the Socrates of Plato, but of Xenophon's Memorabilia as well. In fact, the latter discovered "practical reason," "La relation entre le math6matique et le physique," Revue de metaphysique et de morale (1923), p. 353. 79 Brunschvieg makes the observation, so often made by Whitehead that it has become almost banal, that "Plato and Aristotle still divide the world of philosophers." La modality du jugement, p. 78. Brunschvieg chooses for Plato. 80 In the chapter, "L'universe de la raison" in Les ages de l'intelligence, which is a good statement of his philosophical position, Brunschvieg devotes only three lines out of 38 pages to Pascal. Descartes gets five pages of approval and three of dis- approval (pp. 88-93, 97-99). 81 For a review of the evidence for idea-numbers versus Aristotle's reaction to Plato, see Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (Baltimore, 1944),</page><page sequence="12">BRUNSCHVICG'S INTERPRETATION OF PASCAL 211 physics of Pascal was an advance over Descartes's rationalistic and a priori physics; Pascal in effect rejected the dogmatic cosmology.82 As Pierre Ducass6 has so well expressed it, "the Pascalian intelligence discovered that there are only methods, each of value in its own realm."83 Descartes was a magnificent thinker, but too preoccupied with a single method.84 Just as Pascal revised and corrected the work of Descartes; so Spinoza improved on Pascal by rejecting personal immortality in favor of a God of spirit and truth.85 Brunschvieg's scientific ideals are those of Pascal, specific application of principles and equations to facts, and constant revision of principles and equations to fit new facts, but his ethical and religious viewpoint comes largely from Spinoza. In particular, though he studies it sympathetically, he rejects the Pascalian transcendence.86 In science, art, I, pp. ix-xxv. Cherniss notes that the French classicist Robin's view (which Brun- schvieg essentially follows) is based, "not on any evidence from Aristotle, but on a single sentence in Theophrastus." But cf. Aristotle's distinction between "demon- strative" and "dialectical" philosophy, Prior Analytics I, 24 a, and Books M and N of the Metaphysics. Le progr~s de la conscience I, pp. 141 sq.; Les ages de l'intelligence, pp. 87-92; Heritage de mots, heritage d'idees, pp. 1-14, esp. 8-9. For a more thorough analysis, see La modality du jugement, pp. 16-24 , and a more popular exposition in Introduction a la vie de l'esprit, pp. 18-27. Brunschvieg believes that Aristotle ex- tended the syllogism beyond the specific connections it implies, and rejected the mathematical method, based on judgment, of Plato, Descartes, and Kant. In the French tradition, Brunschvieg follows the Port Royal logic, and speaks of "judg- ment" in many cases where we should say "proposition." Cf. Kapp, Greek Founda- tions of Traditional Logic (N. Y., 1942), pp. 43-45. 82 Le progres de la conscience, I, p. 170. 83 Ducass6, Les grands philosophes (Paris, 1941), p. 73. 84 Mile Meyerson, whose works have been translated and are known to English readers, is somewhat less of a rationalist than Brunschvieg, and a more unconditioned admirer of Descartes. (Nearly all French philosophers genuflect when they pass the Cartesian altar.) A. Dandieu, in the Anthologie des philosophes frangais contemporains (see note 1), p. 249, considers that Meyerson's somewhat grudging recognition of the irrational makes Brunschvieg's position "peu respirable." 85 Le progreIs de la conscience I, p. 188; La raison et la religion, pp. 73, 138-143. "It is Pascal who defends the Jewish interpretation of religion, who proves the divinity of Jesus by the miracles of Moses or the prophecies of Daniel; it is Spinoza who de- fends the religion 'in spirit and in truth' from every temporal and local circumstance, who takes his place among the founders of modern exegesis." Faced with the same problem of miracles and prophecies, and the relation of the Old to the New Testa- ment, Pascal and Spinoza come to diametrically opposite conclusions. Spinoza et ses contemporains, pp. 312 ff. 86 Spinoza's study of Hebrew history convinced him that Hebrew cosmology had the same relation to scientific knowledge as the peasant's belief that the sun is 600 feet away has to the concept that the astronomer forms of the sun's distance from the earth. "Reason legalizes the appeal to the testimony of history because it con- siders the intellectual weakness of the Hebrew people, and knows that to get itself obeyed it must speak clearly the language of ignorance and passion. But by the very fact that it has explained the prejudices which gave birth to the religious civilization of the Jews, it has dispelled them." Spinoza et ses contemporains, p. 323.</page><page sequence="13">212 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH morals, and religion alike, the data we have are immanent in the world we are struggling to know and striving to perfect. In ethics, Brunschvieg's position is more activist than Spinoza's, and humbler than Fichte's.87 But he is everywhere faithful to Pascal's insistence on the general unity of human thinking, "the whole succession of men, through the course of so many centuries, must be considered as the same man who subsists always and learns continually."88 "No demonstrated proposition can limit the vital urge toward the true, no bit of moral progress exhausts the will to the good."89 A combination of Pascal's solitude for reflection and Spinoza's goal of blessedness provides the key to an immanent God.90 Science and ethics meet on the common ground of religion; they both have an irre- sistible urge toward unity that is not limited to one time or one place.
