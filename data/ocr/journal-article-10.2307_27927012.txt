<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Tel Razor, 2002* The thirteenth season of excavations of the 'Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin' took place between 26 June and 6 August 2002. The excavations are sponsored by the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Israel Exploration Society and the Selz Foundation, New York. The expedition benefits from the financial aid of the Antiqua Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland, the Rothschild (Yad Hanadiv) Foundation and the Israel Govern ment Tourist Office. The excavations take place within the Hazor National Park, and receives full cooperation from the National Parks Authority. This year the expedition numbered some 60 participants, close to half the number participating in earlier seasons. These included 25 students of archaeology from the Hebrew University, a group of students of theology from Romania (led by T. Aldea), some 20 volunteers from the U.S. and Europe ? most of them Hazor 'veterans' ? and a group of unemployed labourers. The 'Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin' are directed by Amnon Ben-Tor (Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Area supervisors were: D. Sandhouse (Area A-2), assisted by P. Kampik; D. Ben-Ami (Area A-4), assisted by E. Crawford and R. Coltraine; and D. Zigler (Area A-5), assisted by N. Ortal. The expedition also included: R. Bonfil, assisted by I. Strand (surveying and drafting); R. Lupo (find registration); H. Shafir (photography); and S. Yadid (administration). The expedition was housed in the Gesher guest-house in Safed. The Excavations Work focused on three areas: A-2, A-4 and A-5 (fig. 1). Area A-2. The connection between the Late Bronze Age palace and the street approaching it from the east (most probably from the Bronze Age gate in Area A-5) was investigated and will continue to be studied in the next excavation season. Remnants of private dwellings of the Iron Age (ninth-eighth centuries BCE), located along the northern and north-western flank of the palace, were also investigated. Only the southern edge of these large houses was uncovered; the dwellings extend towards * Cf. IEJ 51 (2001): 235-238. 254</page><page sequence="2">255 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. Hazor 2002: general plan the north, an area not yet excavated. This chain of houses, surrounding the palace to the north and west but from a short distance, suggests a deliberate intention to avoid touching any of the palace walls, which were still visible in the Iron Age at the time of the construction of the dwellings.</page><page sequence="3">256 NOTES AND NEWS One of the noteworthy finds in this area is a fragment of a stone statuette depicting a seated figure (a deity or a worshipper?). The statuette, dating from the Late Bronze Age, is quite similar to two others dis covered by the Yadin expedition in the lower city of Hazor. Area A-4. The eastern approach to the palace was investigated, and an attempt was made to date the massive architectural elements partially uncovered in this area during the 2001 season. It is not yet clear whether these elements are indeed part of the approach to the Late Bronze Age palace, or whether they?in full or in part?should be dated to an earlier palace. A threshold and a large pillar base (1.8 m. in diameter, identical in shape and dimensions to the pair of pillar bases situated at the palace entrance) were discovered here. The location of the missing pillar base, which was robbed in antiquity, was determined by the gravel foundation on which it originally stood. A group of standing stones (masseboth) were uncovered in what is likely to have been the centre of the palace approach (fig. 2). The massive walls unearthed in Area A-4 were severely damaged due to having been turned into a 'stone quarry' by the builders of Hazor in later periods; thus, the dating of all these architectural elements, as well as that of the masseboth, is a difficult issue, to be pursued further in 2003. Area A-5. Remains of the late Iron Age investigated in this area, the last before the Assyrian conquest, belong to the late ninth and mainly to the eighth century BCE. These Iron Age dwellings were built upon the fill of the moat which had originally protected the tenth-century casemate wall on the east. When, in the ninth century, the Fig. 2.

Hazor 2002, Area A-5: Iron Age dwellings on top of Bronze Age mud-brick fortifications city was expanded eastwards, the moat ? now within the city's confines ? was filled and houses were built upon that fill. Huge mud-brick walls ? partly exposed in previous seasons (see IEJ 50 [2000]: 247-248) ? were encountered underneath the Iron Age houses. These walls, preserved to a considerable height, are most probably part of a fortification system (fig. 3). This is apparently the location of the Bronze Age city gate leading to Hazor's acropolis. Indeed, the approach to the upper city throughout the Iron Age (as well as today) was from the east, a location dictated by the site's topography. The moat and the Iron Age dwellings penetrated to a great depth, causing damage to the earlier strata. Although the mud-brick walls are clearly dated to the Bronze Age, it is not yet clear whether they were constructed in the Late Bronze Age, or earlier ? in the Middle Bronze Age. This issue will be further investigated in the next season, following the removal of all the superimposed Iron Age remains. Preservation and Restoration As in all previous seasons, work continued on the preservation and restoration of the palace, focusing on the restoration of the decayed mud-brick walls of the throne room. Additional work has been under taken in preparation for the erection of a protective roof, to span the entire palace. This roof will ensure the preservation of the palace and will enable the site to be opened to the public after completion of all the restoration work. We plan to complete the construction of the roof within six months after the end of the present season.

The work was carried out in three different parts of the site (fig. 1): * Cf. IEJ 49 (1999): 136-138. For summary of previous seasons, see Garfinkel and Miller 2002.

In this area, the focus of the 2000 season, we opened ten new squares to the north and east, enlarging the area of excavation from 300 sq.m. to 550 sq.m. A large part of a building was unearthed, composed of one large courtyard and ten rooms (fig. 2). We hope to unearth the northern and eastern parts of this complex in the 2003 excavation season. Area G. This is a stratigraphie trench (20 5 m.), cutting through the site layers from topsoil to virgin soil. After three seasons (1999, 2000 and 2002), a full sequence of Yarmukian accumulation, c. 3 m. deep, was completely exposed (see below, 2002). A few limestone pebble figurines were found here, in open areas. Area E. Although this is the main excavation area of Shacar ha-Golan, we worked here on a minor scale in 2000. Some new squares were opened in the northern part of this area in an effort to find the northern part of Building Complex II. While this was not achieved that season, more data was gathered on the building, its north-eastern corner and the large street bordering it from the east. A small limestone pebble figurine, with a new type of incision on all four sides, was found inside the north-eastern room of the building (fig. 3). The street (width: 3 m.; exposed to a length of c. 50 m.) runs between Buildings I and II, leading at right angles from the inner part of the site to the Yarmuk River. It is paved with mud plaster mixed with small gravel. A few such layers were found one on top of the other, the result of periodic resurfacing of the street. This indicates that communal maintenance works were carried out in the ancient settlement, suggesting a rather complex social organisation. 2001 The National Geographic and Earthwatch organisation sponsored the eighth (2001)</page><page sequence="7">260 NOTES AND NEWS season of excavations. Due to the political situation, the number of overseas volunteers was reduced to half. Thus, our efforts focused on one excavation area, the western part of Area E, with the aim of clarifying the western and north-western corner of Building II. This large complex had been excavated in our first season, in 1989, and some subsequent work had been carried out there. Now, after 12 years and eight excavation seasons it becomes apparent that this complex is c. 35x20 m. (700 sq.m.) in size (fig. 4), the largest known Neolithic building in the ancient Near East. The complete exposure of this building was the most significant achievement of the Shacar ha-Golan excavations (for schematic plan, see fig. 5). During this season, Area E was enlarged to the west and north by the opening of nine new squares (each 5x5 m.). In addition, ten old squares were reopened and more work was carried out in order to clarify some details on walls and floors. Some baulks Fig. 4. Area E at end of 2001 season Fig. 3. Limestone pebble figurine with new type of incision</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND NEWS 261 Fig. 5. Schematic plan of buildings in Area E were removed before final photography, in order to get a better view of the architecture. By the end of the season the total excavated area of Area E had reached c. 1,700 sq.m. To the assemblage of over 200 Neolithic art objects, already known from previous years, over ten new items were added in the 2001 season. Of special importance are two complete clay figurines of the 'Mother Goddess' type (fig. 6), one of which bears an incised herringbone pattern on its right shoulder and arm and on the left leg. A male figure was also found during this season, the first to be uncovered by our expedition at Shacar ha-Golan (fig. 7). 2002 The ninth excavation season was sponsored with the help of the Irene Levi Sala CARE Archaeological Foundation. We concen trated all our efforts in Area G, reaching virgin soil throughout the trench. In addition one new square (5x5 m.) was opened in the north-western corner of the area; here the upper layers are in a better state of preservation and thus more data on these layers could be gathered. Two main aspects were investigated this summer: The Stratigraphy. A 3 m. accumulation of the Yarmukian (Pottery Neolithic) was found, as well as 1 m. of exposed virgin soil.</page><page sequence="9">262 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 6. Two clay figurines unearthed in Area E during 2001 season This is the first time that such a detailed stratigraphie sequence of a Yarmukian culture was found, as such sites generally do not have thick deposits. The following main phases were noted (from the base of the excavation to the topsoil): a) The sediment at the bottom is the Lisan Formation, the basic geological formation in this part of the Jordan Valley. This layer was exposed to a depth of one metre in the side of a Neolithic pit cut into virgin soil. b) A natural layer of river-wash, composed of unsorted pebbles, gravel, sand, silt and clay sediments, was accumulated to a thickness of 20-50 cm. c) The remains of the first Yarmukian occupation, which was an open-air activity area without architecture. A rounded, carefully built installation was dug at this stage into the virgin soil. d) The first major building in Area G was Fig. 7. Male clay figure unearthed in Area E during 2001 season</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND NEWS 263 found in the south-western corner of the trench. An open-air activity area, various pits and large concentrations of stones were found to the north. An additional phase of construction was found in the south western part of the trench, on top of the earlier wall. e) A sediment layer accumulated in Area G at the end of the previous phase. f) This is a second major construction phase in which a few sub-phases were noted. It was found only in the northern part of the trench, and its most upper part was damaged by the modern intensive agriculture carried out by the local farmers. In the south of Area G this phase has been completely eroded away. g) A few remains ? pits, pottery and flint ? of the Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Ages. h) This topsoil layer includes eroded pottery sherds of the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic periods, as well as modern materials. The excavation of Area G demonstrates that in some parts of Shacar ha-Golan the Neolithic occupation reaches over 3 m. in height and that some parts of the sites were occupied for a long period. The Well. Over the last decade it has become clear that the people of the Neolithic period in the Near East had the hydrological knowledge required for digging wells. The first well was discovered at the PPNC site of cAthlith Yam, an underwater site near Haifa (Galili et al. 1993), and two wells were found at the PPNB site of Kissonerga-Mylouthkia, Cyprus (Peltenburg et al. 2000). At both sites the wells were dug near the Mediterranean shore, where no permanent water source was available. In the final few Fig. 8. Neolithic well at base of Area G</page><page sequence="11">264 NOTES AND NEWS days of the season, a round installation was found, dug into virgin soil (fig. 8). The installation (inner diameter: c. 50 cm.; outer diameter: c. 1.2 m.) is built of large basalt river pebbles and was constructed inside a large pit. So far, eight courses of stone have been unearthed, to a total depth of one metre. Shacar ha-Golan appears to be the third Neolithic site known to date where a well has been found. Another season will be required to excavate this installation to its bottom and to learn how it was constructed. The base of the well will indicate the level of the water table 8,000 years ago. Shacar ha Golan extends the geographical and chronological distribution of Neolithic wells known to date, and thus it seems that the digging of wells was more common then previously thought. The well at Shacar ha Golan contributes to our appreciation of the sophistication of the Pottery Neolithic people. The data accumulated during the last seasons clearly demonstrates that Shacar ha-Golan was unique among the known Neolithic settlements in the following respects: its size, making it the largest known Neolithic site in the Near East; the large building complexes, each occupying a few hundred square metres; the earliest appearance of courtyard houses, a building concept still prevalent today in traditional societies of the Near East; a planned village with a formal network of passageways, including straight main streets that were periodically resurfaced by the inhabitants; a large collection of figurative objects, including over 200 anthropomorphic figurines, about two-thirds of the total number of prehistoric figurines discovered at all prehistoric sites in Israel; the well, which is indicative of sophis ticated hydrological knowledge and technology.

The approximately 200 convention members participated in study tours of sites in the southern Coastal Plain, Philistia and the western Negev, including Tel Ashkelon, Shivta, Mesudat Ashdod-Yam, Mesad Hashavyahu, the synagogue at Modicin and museums at Ashdod and Palmahim, among others. Three evening sessions were held. The first, chaired by A. Biran, included greetings by S. Dorf man, Director of the Israel Antiquities Authority. J. Aviram, Director of the Israel Exploration Society, offered recollections of the three previous conventions held at Ashkelon, in 1954,1967 and 1986. The following lectures were given there: A. Maiamat: Ashkelon from Antiquity until the Babylonian Destruction; R. Voss: The Findings of the Excavations at Tel Ashkelon (in English); and Y Israel: The Byzantine 'Third Mile Farmstead' at Ashkelon. The second session was chaired by G. Barkay and included the following papers: T. Dothan: Innovations in the Study of the Sea Peoples; and M. Rosen-Ayalon: Jewellery of the Islamic Period at Tel Ashkelon. This was followed by the third session, which was chaired by M. Rosen Ayalon and consisted of two lectures: E. Galili: Findings of the Underwater and Coastal Surveys at Ashkelon; and A. Sasson: Water-Supply Methods in the Ashkelon Region. The third session was followed by greetings by S. Haram on behalf of the Mayor of Ashkelon, B. Vaknin, who presented the Society with a special medal of the city of Ashkelon. J. Aviram, on behalf of the Israel Exploration Society, thanked all those organisations and people who contributed to the success of the event, with special thanks extended to the Ashkelon Muni cipality and to Beth Hacam, Afridar, which hosted the convention. OBITUARIES Ornit Ilan, curator of the Rockefeller Museum on behalf of the Israel Museum, died on 4 January 2002 at the age of 46. Ornit Ilan completed her B.A. degree in archaeology and geography at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1982, by which time she was already working at the Israel Museum as Assistant Curator in the Department of Field Archaeology with Ruth Amiran. She excavated primarily Negev sites with Ruth Amiran in the late 1970s and early 1080s: at Tel Arad, Tel Malhata and Biqcat Uvda Site 9. She was appointed head of the Israel Museum's Department of Field Archaeology upon Ruth Amiran's retirement. In June 1992 Ornit was named Curator of the Rockefeller Museum, a position she held until her final days. She renovated large portions of the museum's permanent</page><page sequence="13">266 NOTES AND NEWS exhibition and was the curator in charge of a number of exhibitions, at the Rockefeller Museum, as well as some travelling exhibitions: From Sherd to Vessel (1982), News in Antiquity (1986-87), the Canaanite Periods in the new Arad Municipal Museum (1989) and Arad ? Eine 5000 Jahre alte Stadt in der W?ste Negev, Israel (1992). Her exhibit, The Crucified Man from Jerusalem (1994), aroused considerable public interest and travelled to Canada in 1998. Ornit's final exhibition, Image and Artifact (1998), combined the archaeological highlights of the Rocke feller Museum's permanent collections with the aerial photography (Duby Tal and Moni Haramati) of the sites where these objects were found. In addition to exhibition catalogues, Ornit Ilan published excavation reports and scholarly papers. She co-authored with Ruth Amiran the final report on Tel Arad (Arad II. The Chalcolithic and Early Bronze IB Settlements and the Early Bronze II City: Architecture and Town Planning, Jerusalem, 1996) and worked on the third volume of the Arad publications. She also published Arad (with Ruth Amiran, Michael Sebbane and Zeev Herzog; Tel Aviv, 1997; in Hebrew). Among her articles is the often quoted 'Metallurgy, Trade and the Urbanization of Southern Canaan in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age', co-authored by M. Sebbane, in de Miroschedji, P. (ed.), L'urbanisation de la Palestine a V?ge du bronze ancien, Part 1 [BAR International Series 527[i]), Oxford, 1989: 139-159); and 'Houshold Archaeology at Arad and cAi in the Early Bronze Age , in Wolff, S.R. (ed.), Studies in the Archaeology of Israel and Neighboring Land in Memory of Douglas Esse, Chicago, 2001: 317-354. Her article, 'Egyptian Pottery from Small Tel Malhata and the Interrelations Between the Egyptian "Colony" in Southwest Palestine and the "Canaanite" Arad Basin and Central Highlands', appeared post humously in van den Brink, E.C.M. and Levy, T.E. (eds.), Egypt and the Levant (London ? New York, 2002: 306-322). Forthcoming is her paper on 'Egyptians at Megiddo at the End of the 4th Millennium BCE' (co-authored with her husband, David Ilan).</page></plain_text>
