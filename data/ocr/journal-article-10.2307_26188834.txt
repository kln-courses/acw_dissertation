<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Emotions of God in the Theology of St. Augustine That absolute immutability and impassibility became solidly established attributes of God in Christian theology is due mostly to the influence of Augustine. Theologians have recently begun to question whether views of God which uphold these attributes in an absolute sense, hence denying the relatedness of God to his temporal creation, are entirely appropriate1. This development, along with the usually unnoticed fact that Tertullian defended mutability and passibility in God, suggests that a clear understanding of Augustine's doctrine of God is important2. On the one hand, theologians have been aware that the biblical witness strongly attests to the various emotions of a God who is living and involved in the affairs of his people. Christians have a religious heritage which emphatically insists on the effective nature of petitionary prayer and the temporal reality of the difference between judgment for sin, and the saving love and forgiveness which is beyond our understanding. On the other hand, traditional theology presents us with a God who is incapable of change and feeling, whose attitude toward his creatures is one of "predominating in 1.

One way to confront this dichotomy is to reappro priate as fully as possible the main theological conception which is its historical cause. This is the Augustinian understanding of God. Even a surface reading of Augustine shows that he is "intransigent in his contention that God is absolutely immutable"4. To a great extent this intransigence is due to the influence of the Neo-Platonic understanding of God5. Indeed for Augustine himself, immutability may have been God's most important attribute, "the basis on which other attributes rest, the root from which they spring"6. Many passages in Augustine's works suggest this7. Even if such is not the case, however, we are certainly dealing with a central affirma tion. It is one which cannot be revised without calling into question the theological adequacy of his entire conception of God. Augustine's reasons for insisting on divine immutabilitv are manv. Absolute immutability grounds the immutability of truth8; it also distinguishes God from all créatures, including the soul and angels 3. This phrase is used approvingly in regard to God in Thomas Aquinas by R. Garrigou-Lagrange, God : His Existence and Nature (St. Louis : B. Herder, 1935) II, 101. 4. Bernard J. Cooke, The Mutabilily-lmmutability Principle in St. Augustine's Metaphysics, in Modem Schoolman 24 (Nov. 1946) 43. 5.

This is not the view of ail other scholars as Cooke indicates. Some think divine simplicity lies at the root of Augustine's conception of God. Another possibility is that of the spirituality of God. There is a good possibility that none of God's attributes is in fact the root of ail the others, but that ail imply each other. Augustine sometimes emphasizes one, and sometimes another in his writings. See note 11 below. 7.

AUGUSTINE which are spiritual like God9; it is essential to God's perfection10; and God is immutable because He is eternally beyond time11. Because God cannot change, he is impassible. Contrary to some biblical passages, He cannot have feelings. The Bible and the Christian tradition have characteristically attributed feelings to God, even 'unworthy' feelings such as wrath, jealously, and regret for a former décision. These attributions became acutely problematic for Augustine, as they had been for Christian writers before him. The main Opponent on this question for earlier writers was Marcion, who denied the goodness of the God of Judaism outright. His wrath. His iealousv. and the arbitrarv abilitv to change His mind were characteristics unworthy of the Father of Jesus Christ. For Augustine, the Manichees raised this question in somewhat the same manner. "In Manichaeism, the stern Jehovah of the Jews was rejected as a malevolent démon It will have to be shown by Augustine that God does not literally have unworthy feelings because He does not change. He does have to defend the truth of the Hebrew scriptures, however, against Manichean criticism. 9. De Civ. IV.31 (CCSL 47, 126); VIII.5 states that to ascribe mutability which the soul has to the divine nature is ne/as (222). In VIII.6 he argues divine simplicity and immutability simultaneously (223).

This is especially clear in those passages where Augustine défends God's eternal immutable foreknowledge and will, such as De Civ.

No feeling what soever is appropriate to the divine immutable essence. God is impassible because he is immutable. God s Anger 13 Augustine's favorite explanation for God's anger as portrayed in the Bible is that it is the divine punishment for sin, but has no perturbatio accompanying it. While God judges and condemns the sinner He feels nothing. We must take care, however, to understand that the anger of God is free from any turbulent emotion ; for His anger is an expression for His just method of taking vengeance; as the law might be said to be angry when its ministers are moved to punish by its sanctions14. God's anger is only "just rétribution", but not "perturbation of the mind"15. His anger is not like ours, because ours is irrational16. The power which God has to punish sinners is called anger only "metaphorically from custom"11. It is "transferred by analogy from human émotions"18, and it applies to "the effect of His vengeance, not to the disturbing mental affection"19. The fact that God is said to be angry is "an abuse of the word, or a peculiarity of idiom"20. Because God knows from ail eternity those upon whom punish meiit will fall, he need not respond temporally and mutably to their sins as they are committed. His anger is only his "just and fixed" condemnation of sinners21. 13. I am indebted in this treatment of divine anger to the short article by J.-C. Fredouille, Sur la colère divine: Jamblique et Augustin, in Recherches augustiniennes 5 (1968) 7-13. Fredouille lists approximately twenty texts of Augustine on divine anger on 8-9. 14.

His décision is as inflexible as His prescience is certain22. In one place Augustine suggests that every judgment of God can be called His ira. Sometimes He judges to perfect, and sometimes to condemn. Here the divine anger is reduced to judgment completely, since even the judgment of the saint is wrathful23. And this is not God's temporal response in either case, but is eternally willed. Divine anger is nothing more than the eternal condemnation of the sinner, or pertecting οί the saint. Augustine occasionally gives other explanations for God's wrath. He sometimes thinks of it as a holy anger which is feit, not by God, but by a holy soul when it sees the divine law broken by a sinner. He also suggests that God's anger might be an obscuratio mentis for the sinner himself. In both cases divine anger does not apply to God at all24. Augustine gives this psychological explanation most persuasively in his last text on the subject25 : when God is said to change His will, as when, e.g.. He becomes angry with those to whom He was gentle, it is rather they than He who are changed, and they find Him changed in so far as their experience of suffering at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to injured eyes, and becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful from being delightful, thought in itself it remains the same as it was26. Uncharacteristic of Augustine's discussions of divine anger is yet another suggestion in the City which shows his pessimism about life. God's anger is another word for human existence. For God's anger is this mortal life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his days pass as a shadow27. The wrath of God îs the punishment of death for Adam's sin, as well as ail the evils of life which précédé death, evils which will be done away with in the afterlife.

Augustine's usual explanation for God's anger, however, is that it is an idiomatic, metaphorical, and possibly improper term for the punishment of sinners which God eternally foreknows and immutably wills. God s repentance Some scriptural passages which have been especially problematic for theologians state that God repents for a former décision. The author of Gen. 6.7 visualizes the creator of the world as regretting the création of the sinful human race : "I repent that I made man". Another text (/ Sam. 15.11 ; also 15.35) states that God "repents ... that I have set up Saul to be king". As a resuit God rejects Saul and chooses David. A third case in which repentance is attributed to God is in response to human repentance for sin and prayers for forgiveness. God changes his mind about punishing the Ninevites. "When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God renented of the evil which he had said he would do to them: and he did not do it" {Jon. 3.10)29. These passages contradict divine immutability and impassibility if interpreted literally, as well as the divine prescience. They also might suggest that God can make errors. If He can be sorry for one of his former actions, it may indicate that He did not know its outcome, and therefore chose incorrectly or unwisely. Tertullian offered a good solution to this problem by arguing from the Greek metanoia. The term indicates only a "simple change 28. Enarr. in Ps. 37.5 (CCSL 38, 384-385). Pinomaa plausibly suggests but does not establish a dichotomy between Augustine the theoretician and Augustine the religious man regarding divine anger.

AUGUSTINE 1 1 of prior purpose" or change of mind, and does not necessarily imply confession of sin or error. Tertullian was Willing to admit that God could undergo this charfge of mind, seeing it as a divine prérogative3 °. But Augustine deals with the text in the light of his believe in absolute immutability, as well as with the Latin phrase poenitet me, and its clear reference to sorrow for a prior décision31. Neither sorrow nor error can be in God32. It is in regard to this problem that Augustine gives his most radical interprétation of biblical passibility or mutability texts. Passages such as these, he says, do express it are found only rarely in the divine scriptures33. Repentance is simply impossible for God, since complété fore knowledge and regret for a décision cannot coexist. Therefore, we deny penitence34! That something could be temporally added to God's knowledge is absurdissimum atque falsissimum. Therefore, in spite of what the scriptures say, God does not repent. Augustine writes later in this passage that God repents in an ineffable manner, and this is clearly a weakening of the negamus which précédés it35. Augustine also offers less radical solutions. In one of his best discussions of divine repentance, he explains how the scriptural references to God's émotions are improper expressions just as those which refer to His feet, face, hands, and eyes. Such expressions are used because of custom, and because of the poverty of human expression. The inspired authors knew füll well that God did not literally have émotions, or a body. God's hand is the power by which 30. Contra Marcionem 11.24.

By the same token divine repentance is the divine providence by which the world is calmly administrated by God. Specifically, God's repentance refers to those things which providentially pass out of existence contrary to our wishes36. In another place Augustine gives the same type of solution, referring divine repentance to our perception of a specific type of providence. 1 he repentance οι God reters to things ruled by his power which change unexpectedly for us ..,"37. This explanation is the same as his final explanation for God's anger, that it is only something we perceive, and not something which is objectively présent in God. Ail of Augustine's interprétations of the repentance passages suggest either outright déniai, or that divine repentance for déci sions is only a subjective perception of ours, a perception of a providence which is eternally unchanging. In discussing Jonah 3.10, he says that God is not uncertain about the repentance of the Ninevites, but only seems so38. Regarding Gen. 6.7, he reaffirms the doctrine that God does not change, but his judgment appears to change, that is, to us39. God exchanged David for Saul, thereby changing his works, but he changed them "through his own immutable will"40. In effect, Augustine's explanation for these passages is that God Himself does not repent at ail because he cannot, and his Statutes change only from our point of view41. 36.

XIV.11 (CCSL 48, 431).</page><page sequence="9">THE EMOTIONS OF GOD IN ST. AUGUSTINE 1 3 Jealousy A third divine emotion which was problematic for Augustine was jealousy42. The attribution of jealousy to God is based upon passages such as Ex. 20.5; 34.15; Deut. 4.24 and II Cor. 11.2. These texts also caused problems for earlier Christian writers in debates with Marcionites. Here as in the case of repentance, Augustine's choice is clear. He must either deny that God can become jealous, or, less radically, interpret God's jealousy as some quality which does not contradict immutability and impassibility. He generally follows the latter course, describing God's jealousy as his eternal unchanging providence or justice when it is applied to certain specific situations. We cannot denv God's iealousv. he writes. because it is found in the scriptures. But we must uphold it in some way which is far removed from the case of jealousy because of unchastity. We must dérivé another understanding in God's case. Since the anger of God is not perturbatio mentis but potentia vindicandi, his jealousy is not the cruciatum animi which pertains to marital jealousy, but tranquil and sincere justice and providence43. At times Augustine cornes closer to a literal understanding of God's jealousy than he does for any other unworthy emotion, and seems to want to uphold it properly as an emotion. After one purges tne îeeling or any unworthy quality, ît must necessarity be applied to God. God is jealous as when diligence is manifested in guarding conjugal chastity, in which sense it is profitable for us not only unhesitatingly to admit but thank fully to assert, that God is jealous of his people when He calls them His wife44". In another anti-Manichean text, Augustine affirms his principle 42. See Pierre Adnès, Jalousie de Dieu, in Dictionnaire de Spiritualité VIII (Paris : Beauchesne, 1974), 79-93. 43. Contra Adim. Man. discipl. XI (CSEL 25, 136); see also Contra Advers. Legis et Prophet 1.20.40 (PL 42, 627). Here the Providentia is defined precisely to match the biblical idea of God's jealousy. It is "Providentia quae non sinit eos quos subditos habet impune amare quod prohibet". 44. Contra Faust. 22.18 (CSEL 25, 607).</page><page sequence="10">14 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE that "nothing is able to be said that is worthy of God"45. A prime example of this is the statement that the Word of God came down from heaven, even though it cannot move from place to place, because it is présent everywhere. But if we take away error and sorrow from our notion of jealousy, nothing remains except the will to guard chastity and to condemn conjugal corruption. What better word is there to express the will of God to keep us from love of corrupt things, his will to love our chastity, and to punish our nnrhastitv? For "Fie who is not iealous does not love"46. The consuming fire which is combined with jealousy in Deut. 4.24 is God's love for us, and his jealousy is part of that love. Earlier in this same work, after stating the principle that the scriptures are incapable of expressing divine things properly, Augustine says that God's jealousy is the power and discipline which prevents the soul from fornicating with impunity. The spiritual fornication which He prevents is the turning away from God and the turning toward corrupt temporal things47. This preventive aspect of divine providence is also said to keep the soul from being cor rupted by following false gods48. Although he défends God's jealousy and seems to sense its propriety even as a divine emotion, ultimately Augustine reduces it, like God's anger, to some aspect of eternal providence or justice. Within the confines of Augustine's system, it is difficult if not impossible to defend the literal reality of divine émotions such as regret, anger, and jealousy. Yet the tact tnat Uod nas tnese émotions in some objective manner may be of vital religious importance, and I believe that Augustine perceived this at least in the case of jealousy. Is there no sense in which God can objectively be said to be surprised at the depths of human sinfulness? Is it not religiously significant that God is able to react negatively to our deeds? Did God never really hear the prayers of the Ninevites and respond temporally to their penitence by changing his mind? Is there no possible divine response to the world which can legitimately be 45.

AUGUSTINE 1 5 called God's anger? Is there no jealousy which is scripturally as well as religiously appropriate to the divine? In this last case Augustine himself suggests that there is, although by strict philo sophie standards to which he is committed, there cannot be. Augustine's theology does not allow for the systematic expression of these important religious insights into the nature of God. God s love and mercy At the end of his long and well known discussion of time in Book XI of the Confessions, Augustine writes : Therefore, just as in the beginning you have known heaven and earth without change in your knowledge so too 'in the beginning you made heaven and earth' without any différence in your activity. Whosoever understands this, let him confess it to you, and whosoever does not understand it. let him confess it to vou49. In another passage in the Confessions he distinguishes four types of priority which might apply to that of God over création, then states that the type which God has rara visio est et nimis ardua conspicere50. While he does give a type of solution to the question of God's priority51, the deeper problem which he must résolve is how to describe the relation between God and his créatures without making God mutable and passible. Does God's relationship to créatures begin to be for God as well as for créatures? Is God continuously affected by it? What does it mean to say that God loves and forgives us, as well as créâtes us in time? De Trinitate V.16.17 systematically attempts to answer these questions52. In some sense, Augustine says, God became the Lord of création, and the Lord of Israel. Various examples of the occurrence of new relations are given, such as that of a carpenter to a wooden ehest that he makes, but this does not apply to God. So far as God is concerned, there can only be relations which cause change on the side of his effects, and not in Hirn. The first example 49. XI. 31 (ΒΑ II, 342). 50. XII. 29.40 (ΒΑ II, 414). 51.

This he does not press for the obvious reason that friendship nécessitâtes reciprocity. The second example is that of money, which can be either a price or a pledge, without undergoing any change because of its relation ship to one or the other to both. The relation between God and créatures can begin to be in time, although nothing happens to the substance of God. In the same manner, money can begin to be a price or a pledge without itself becoming anything différent. "O Lord", it is said, "you are our refuge". God becomes our refuge only so far as we are concerned, but not so far as he is concerned. Did something happen in God's nature which was not happening before we took refuge in him? No. In nobis ergo fit aliqua mutatio ... in illo autem nulla. God begins to be our Father when we are regenerated by his grâce. But there is a change only in us, not in him. Augustine states the theological principle which applies to ail cases of the divine in its relation to créatures : Therefore, anything that begins to be said of Him in time, which had not been attributed to Him previously, is evidently spoken of relatively, but such expressions are not used according to an accident of God, as though something new had taken place in Him, but plainly according to an accident of that créature with whom God, according to our manner of speaking, entered into a relationship54. ineretore uoa cannot oegin to love someone. wnen we πηα uoa, we only say that God begins to love us, but this is incorrect if believed literally.

So, too, when we speak of Him as being ... gentle towards the good; it is they who are changed, not He ; just as light is painful to weak eyes and pleasing to strong eyes, namely, by their change, not its own. In another passage, Augustine collapses the relation of love between God and créatures into God's giving of being to créatures in général5S. The solution to the problem of how an immutable creator 53. "et tune refugium nostrum fit cum ad eum refugimus". 226. 54. V.16.17 (CCSL 50, 227). 55.

How does God love us, he asks? So that he might use and enjoy us? If God enjoys us, he needs us, and no sane person would say this. He is our every good, or our every good cornes from him. Therefore, he does not enjoy us because he doesn't need us. But he does use us. For if he does neither, Augustine writes, I cannot discover how he loves us ! He then hastens to add that God cannot use us in the way that we use created things. His use of us is connected to his own goodness. It can only mean that "because he is good, we are, and in so far as we are, we are good". Instead of God enjoying us, or making use of us in some manner which these words imply, he cause us to exist, and that is what it means to say that he loves us ! Mercy Since God cannot truly feel love for his créatures, neither can he feel merciful. Human mercy is accompanied by a feeling of misery of heart (miser-icordia), which God cannot have. Human misery of heart accompanies the feelings of mercy or compassion, because by means of human compassion, one shares the misery of the one pitied56. It is impossible for the divine essence to be disturbed by such an emotion, worthy as it is. With regard to pity, if you take away the compassion which involved a sharing of misery with him whom you pity, so that there remains the peaceful goodness of helping and freeing from misery, some kind of knowledge of the divine pity is suggested57. 56. Contra Adimant. Man. discip. XI (CSEL 25, 137); De div. quaes. ad Simpl. II.2.3 (CCSL 44, 79); Contra Advers. Legis et Prophet. 1.20.40 (PL 42, 627). In De Civ. IX.5 (CCSL 47, 254), "what is mercy but a certain feeling of compassion in our hearts, evoked by the misery of another and compelling us to offer all possible aid?" See Theodore Koehler, Miséricorde, in Dictionnaire de Spiritualité X (Paris: Beauchesne, 1979), 1322-3. He rightly stresses the importance of this attribute for Augustine. "L'expérience de sa propre conversion et les débats sur la grâce ont inspiré à Augustin une spiritualité fondée sur la foi en la charité miséri cordieuse de Dieu". Nevertheless Augustine denies that God can truly have such a feeling of compassion "evoked by the misery of another" lest he become passible and mutable. 57. De div. quaest. ad Simpl. II.2.3 (CCSL 44, 79).</page><page sequence="14">1 8 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE This text is important in that it suggests that God does fee something, albeit purged of the human emotion of "sharing of misery". God feels the peaceful goodness of helping and freeing from misery, and this gives some meaning to the divine pity. Yet the most obvious interprétation of this feeling is that it is no feeling at ail, and that divine mercy is reduced to God's giving of being to those who are saved. God's peaceful goodness is only his eternally foreknown and predestined giving of grâce to the saints. His ability to help and to free his créatures from misery can be only his eternal prédestination of some soûls before the constitution of the world, which is équivalent to his giving of their existence in grâce58. In the final analysis it is emotion-less, although Augustine perhaps wished for religious reasons that it were otherwise. God's mercy is non-temporal so far as God is concerned. The divine émotions are described in summary fashion in the following way : God's repentance is not because of error; his anger has no ardor of a perturbed mind; his mercy does not have the compassionate misery suggested by the Latin term ; the jealousy of God has no spite of mind. But the repentance of God refers to things ruled by his power which change unexpectedly for us ; the anger of God is the punishment of sin ; the mercy of God is the goodness of helping; the jealousy of God is providence, which does not allow those which it has subdued to love with impunity what it prohibits59. There is indeed some différence between a déniai that God can regret his décisions, and the suggestion that an unexpected and perceptible change in human affairs ruled by providence appears to be a divine change of will to us, although such is not really the case. Also there is a différence between seeing God's jealousy as justice and providence in général, or more specifically as providential punishment for improper human loving. There is a différence between an outright déniai that God can be angry and the réduction of divine anger to our perception, or to punishment for sin. Finally, God can validly be said to love us and to have mercy on us, 58. Contra Advers. Legis et Prophet. 1.20.40 (PL 42, 627). See also De div. quaest. ad Simpl. 1.2.7 (CCSL 44, 31-32) where God's mercy précédés faith and is not a response of his at all. Also Retract. 1.24 (PL 32, 628). 59. Contra Advers. Legis et Prophet. 1.20.40 (PL 42, 627).</page><page sequence="15">THE EMOTIONS OF GOD IN ST. AUGUSTINE 19 because he créâtes us and prédestines us for salvation. Augustine défends the divine émotions by placing them in our preception, or by reducing them to impassible divine qualities of providence, justice, punishment for sin, or God's eternal action toward us which does not involve change in Himself. God seems to feel anger, jealousy, and regret for His décision, and even love, as well as the calm goodness which results from helping others. But God in fact, feels nothing. Contemporary theology must ask Augustine whether this is a satisfactory defense of the émotions of God as presented by the Biblical authors. Was it their intention to présent the impassible divine being as though he were passible, knowing füll well that he was not? Or was their understanding of God's passibility overly literal and anthropomorphic? There is another alternative. Perhaps the God οί Christian and Jewish taith can be seen as passible in some respects. Because Augustine's conception of God's immuta bility and impassibility have been so important in theology, its limitation in the light of some biblical texts and some important religious perceptions must be noted. A critical appropriation may allow contemporary conceptions of God which are rooted in Augustine, to confront the alternative, that God is somehow mutable and passible. This is especially the case if, as I have suggested, Augustine himself occasionally perceived the limitations of his philosophie position on immutability when confronted by biblical texts and his own religious impulses. College of St. Thomas, Department ofTheology St.Paul, Minnesota. Joseph M. Hallman Summary Augustine's strong insistence that God is immutable leads to an inability on his part to take the bjblical images of divine wrath, jealousy, and regret for a former décision seriously. For the same reason, he cannot accept the reality of divine love or mercy if they involve any true feeling on God's part. Contemporary theology needs to evaluate this aspect of Augustine's theology critically.</page></plain_text>
