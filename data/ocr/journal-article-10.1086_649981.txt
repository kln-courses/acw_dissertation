      <p>Many twentieth‐century theologians and philosophers abandoned what they thought were outmoded conceptions of God. They insisted, in particular, that technological change and scientific progress were incompatible with an unchanging God. To some, an immutable deity also seemed remote and unresponsive to humanity’s massive suffering. Today, debates about divine immutability have receded because many people accept the idea that God changes. Analytic philosophers of religion, such as Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, and Nicolas Wolterstorff, reject divine immutability. Evangelical theologians known as “open theists” think that the biblical God changes in response to prayers. Some feminist theologians believe that only a mutable God can manifest proper love toward the Creation. In many circles, the idea of divine immutability has all but disappeared.</p>
      <p>Michael Dodds is a welcome exception to this general trend. In this superb book (an updated version of an earlier work), he demonstrates how many arguments for divine mutability are historically uninformed and philosophically confused. Carefully analyzing motion, Dodds details Aquinas’s nuanced approach to God’s nature. He also rehearses familiar but important philosophical defenses of divine immutability. Finally, by considering existence and analogical language, Dodds undercuts charges that an immutable God is distant and unloving.</p>
      <p>Dodds devotes his first chapter to meticulously detailing creaturely motion. Aquinas uses the term “motion” in more than thirty ways. Immanent and transient movements are particularly significant. Transient motion passes from the doer to something external, while immanent motion remains within the doer. Human beings exhibit both kinds of motion. For example, the intellect uses discursive reason to arrive at a truth but rests once it reaches it. The human will shows a similar pattern of movement and immobility, seeking objects and resting in them.</p>
      <p>After explicating creaturely motion, Dodds turns to divine immutability (chap. 2). He provides a detailed guide to the remarkable range of Aquinas’s discussions of immutability. Like other recent scholars, Dodds considers Aquinas’s theological and philosophical commentaries. In his biblical analyses, Dodds shows, Aquinas employs sophisticated hermeneutical and exegetical principles to answer those claiming that the biblical God changes.</p>
      <p>In chapter 3, Dodds discusses how an immutable God creates and sustains the universe. Here, he reviews well‐known but significant arguments about God and the world, the Incarnation, and divine providence. For example, he notes how discussions of “real” relations ignore subtleties of Aquinas’s argument. God bears no real relation to Creation, and many contemporary theologians mistakenly think, therefore, that God has only a notional relation to us. To forestall this conclusion, Dodds suggests we use the term “mixed relation” to indicate the Creation’s ontological dependence on God. Dodds also rejects the idea that creating changes the divine nature. This idea presupposes an ill‐defined conception of change that evaporates under careful scrutiny. Finally, Dodds considers how God exercises providence and interacts with human beings. Rather than monopolizing all power, God allows for genuine human freedom.</p>
      <p>In his final and most intriguing chapter, Dodds turns to divine love. Noting love’s essential features, he describes how an unchanging God responds to human suffering. Through love, God wills the person’s good in an intimate union of friendship. Divine immutability enhances charity because God gains nothing from free gifts to humanity. A mutable God, in contrast, stands to gain from human beings and cannot offer a gratuitous gift.</p>
      <p>Throughout the book, Dodds makes three significant points about Aquinas and divine immutability. First, we cannot make broad generalizations about Aquinas based on limited textual exegesis. Too often, theologians draw premature conclusions based on a few selections from the <italic>Summa Theologica</italic> or <italic>Summa contra Gentiles</italic>. In contrast, Dodds shows that we need sophisticated readings of Aquinas’s corpus. Second, Dodds undermines the common claim that Aquinas is a premodern who devalues change. His evaluation of change depends on a being’s nature and circumstances. Change in a growing plant is good, but degeneration in a virtuous man is bad. Finally, Dodds rebuts the charge that Aquinas uncritically imports Greek concepts into Christian theology. This idea (long ago discredited by sophisticated Aquinas scholars and historians of Christianity) continues to carry weight in some theological circles. However, those embracing it display remarkable ignorance of Aquinas’s original synthesis of Greek, Arabic, and biblical ideas.</p>
      <p>Most important, Dodds locates divine immutability within Aquinas’s key metaphysical and semantic concepts. For example, he carefully analyzes the metaphysical principle of existence (<italic>esse</italic>), or active presencing. Despite considerable twentieth‐century Thomistic scholarship, contemporary thinkers continue to treat Aquinas like an Aristotelian, disregarding his creative development of <italic>esse</italic>. We see the significance of <italic>esse</italic> in Dodds’s account of divine activity. Theologians from diverse orientations accuse “classical” or orthodox theism of embracing a static God. Yet, far from being inactive, Aquinas’s God is the maximum instance of activity whose essence it is to exist. Moreover, all creatures participate in the divine activity in a dynamic web of relations. Despite this remarkable vision, open theists, process theologians, and others repeat ad nauseam the canard that classical theism’s God is inert. They conflate divine immutability and inactivity, a product of careless thinking about the divine <italic>esse</italic>.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Esse</italic> also helps us properly interpret Aquinas’s famous use of analogical language. Unable to capture the divine <italic>esse</italic> with a clear concept, we cannot speak about God exactly as we would humanity (univocal predication). Instead, we must use general concepts to refer analogically to humanity and God. With few exceptions, however, contemporary thinkers discussing divine immutability thoughtlessly employ univocal language. Dodds contrasts their simplistic approach to theological predication with Aquinas’s creative use of Pseudo‐Dionysius’s “Triple Way” of causality, negation, and eminence. For Aquinas, these tools prevent us from embracing a dangerous anthropomorphism.</p>
      <p>Without analogical language, we also radically misunderstand divine love. Allegedly, Aquinas’s God cannot respond to suffering human beings praying for aid. The modern or postmodern world, we are told, contains so much suffering that it requires a God who changes and feels its pain. Parental analogies often make their appearance in these arguments. We would rightfully condemn a parent who remains unaffected by a child’s suffering. Similarly, an immutable God would be a moral monster, oblivious to terrorism, torture, and other horrors. Such analogies carry emotional weight but mislead because they ignore the analogical character of love. Human love is a motion that includes passions, but passions do not represent love’s essential meaning. Focusing on its analogical core, Dodds analyzes benevolence and an intimate union with the object. God is not like a giant compassionate parent, but this detracts nothing from God’s gratuitous love for humanity.</p>
      <p>Dodds’s book is a learned and persuasive defense of divine immutability. It will challenge those who complacently embrace a deity often created in their own image.</p>
