One studio has often dominated the field of animation in certain periods. Pat Sullivan's Felix the Cat (animated by Otto Mesmer) was the trendsetter in the 1920s, and became the first animated film star. In the 1930s, the Walt Disney Studio, producer of the first successful animated feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), became regarded as the standard bearer to which other animation studios aspired. In the years of World War Two, Warner Brothers, became the most popular animation production company, their star, the brash and aggressive Bugs Bunny chal lenging, although not displacing, the more staid product of the Disney Stu dio. In the 1950s, UPA (United Productions of America), a small and little known company, became the industry leader and the new site for creativity and innovation in animation. Many books have been written about other animation pioneers, but none about UPA—until now. Adam Abraham's book, When Magoo Flew: The Rise and Fall of the Animation Studio UPA admirably fills this void in animation history. He traces the origins of UPA in the Disney strike of 1941, UPA's attempt to cre ate animation on the model of modernist fine art, the major founders behind the success of the company, and its ultimate triumph and decline. Abraham divides his book into four major parts, each detailing a stage in UPA's his tory. The first section, "Before the Beginning," describes the origins of the company in the bitter Disney strike of 1941. The Disney Studio in the 1930s has been described as the "WPA" of animation that offered budding artists a job and an opportunity of learning one's craft and being part of a studio that was making animation history. Abraham presents the negative side of work at Disney's but not the positive side. On the down side was the low pay and inequitable wages at the lower levels, arbitrarily set by Disney's mood and predilections. There were three founding members of UPA. Zack Schwartz's tal ent was quickly noticed by Disney, and he was made head of the layout department. Brimming with creativity he had an idea about how to do back grounds in a new way. "You don't have to use realistic colors," he told Dis 189</page><page sequence="2">190 ney, "you can design your characters and backgrounds so that the end result will be a picture unlike anything anyone has seen before" (qtd. in Abraham 8). Walt initially seemed interested and Schwartz sent him some reference books. A few weeks later, the books were returned with no reply, not even a thank you note. Schwartz's friend David Hilberman was more politically minded and a member of the John Reed Club, a group of "left-wing artists, writers and musicians." Hilberman had worked at the State People's Theater of Leningrad and taken classes at the Leningrad Academy of Fine Art where he studied Soviet modernist art. Steve Bustustow, was the third founding member of UPA. In 1940 he was promoted to animator on Fantasia and Dumbo, although his name never appeared on the screen. Lack of credits was one of the complaints that led to the Disney strike. Bustustow was one of twenty artists fired by Disney just a month before the strike. He later joined the picket line and emerged as one of the leaders of the strike. The strike evoked passion on both sides, with Disney taking it per sonally, "like a stern father faced by the rebellion of youth," in the words of a writer (Abraham 22). Disney refused to negotiate with SCG (the Screen Cartoonists Guild) as a legitimate union. The National Labor Relations Board stepped in, ruling in favor of the strikers, but Disney stalled negotia tions. They weren't concluded until a month after Disney was sent to Latin America on a good will tour for the government. In Part Two, "UPA and the Animated Ideal," Abraham describes the formation of UPA and their first films. Former Disney strikers and other animation personnel were drafted into the armed forces after December 7, 1941, and Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entry into World War II. Films that would be expensive and difficult to make in live-action could be made much more easily and cheaply in animation. Because of tiny budgets and short deadlines, artists were forced to employ shortcuts, includ ing simplified graphics, and limited, stylized animation—techniques that would later become a UPA signature. The future animators of that studio also discovered a new- found freedom, according to Abraham, allowed to make films largely the way they pleased (within the constraints of an in structional film) that they never had working for Walt Disney. Because of the Disney strike, hundreds of experienced artists were available to work and experimentation began to take place in the major animation studios. Zack Schwartz got a job at Screen Gems at Columbia Pictures where he helped animate their Fox and the Crow series. With future UPA artist Bill Hurtz, Schwartz set out to make a cartoon unlike other car toons and as "unrealistic ... as I could get." (Abraham 35) Bustustow was</page><page sequence="3">191 fired by Disney for the second time in September 1941. While many of his co-workers scrambled to look for jobs with or animation studios, he decided to start a company of his own. One of these, David Hilberman, also decided to leave the Disney Studio and worked with Zack Schwartz at Screen Gems. One evening the two were commiserating about their frustrations at being unable to realize their creative potential at their respective studios, and they decided to rent office space and start an animation company of their own. David Hilberman joined them and the nucleus of UPA was formed. The organization soon acquired some of the talented artists that would make it so innovative. John Hubley was hired in 1945, and he and Phil Eastman worked on storyboards together for the company. Bill Hurtz, joined the staff as Hubley's assistant and co-designer. Influenced by mod emist painter Pablo Picasso, Hubley became one of the leading lights of the new company, moving toward "freer and more contemporary characters," according to Hurtz (qtd. in Abraham 59). However, by 1946, the three UPA owners began to bicker and Schwartz and Hilberman decided to sell out to Bustustow. He ended up with a controlling interest and brought Hubley on board as creative director of UPA. As government contracts dried up, UPA had to transition into an entertainment company. With no assets, no continuing cartoon star, and only a small staff, the company had to find a distributor to take on its films. Columbia Pictures' Screen Gems became their savior. UPA contracted to produce four films for Screen Gems the first two of which were for their undistinguished Fox and the Crow series to be directed by Hubley. Tired of doing "talking animals," they wanted to make films of their own with human characters. So Hubley and writer Millard Kaufman came up with a new character based on their respective uncles "who were very aggressive in whatever the hell they believed and were very short on tolerance with anyone who disagreed with them," in Kaufman's words (qtd. in Abraham 78). Searching for a name they recalled weird California place locations like "Point Mugu, which is above Malibu, they shortened the name to "Ma goo" and a new cartoon star was bom, Mr. Magoo. Hubley and Kaufman also wanted to get away from the violence and "hurt gags" typical of Warner Brothers and MGM cartoons. They devised a story featuring the nearsight ed Mr. Magoo and his nephew Waldo, in which Magoo mistakes a bear for his raccoon-coated nephew: Ragtime Bear (1949). One of the most artistically important creations of UPA was based on a recording made by Theodore Geisel, known to his readers as Dr. Se uss. The resulting film, Gerald McBoing Boing (1950), won an Academy Award and solidified UPA's modemist style. Bobe Cannon directed and</page><page sequence="4">192 animated the film. Abraham does an admirable job of describing the artistic techniques used in the film. However, his interpretation of it is wanting. He characterizes Gerald, who can only speak sounds not words, as a "conform ist" who simply wants to fit into society (Abraham 89). But, I see him as a non-conformist, and the film as a satire on the fear of difference within the homogeneous suburbs of the 1950s. His father becomes hysterical when he discovers Gerald's "disability" and runs around in circles, afraid about what people will say about his offspring. He sends Gerald to school as much to avoid public censure as to educate him: so that "he will learn words" and won't be thought of as a "fool." The cartoon also reveals the way institu tions repress individual difference: Gerald is ejected from the one-room schoolhouse for making sounds with uncaring alacrity, and the chain link fence that surrounds the building is an index of its disciplinary nature. Although Abraham pays much attention to the animation and back grounds in Gerald, he doesn't deal with a crucial element of its modemist style: sound. Sound is foregrounded throughout the film as in Gerald's sounds and in the Western drama in which he makes all the sound effects. Sound is usually invisible in film but guides the mood conveyed by a scene. In foregrounding Gerald's sound effects and showing them in a fictional play, the cartoon introduces a measure of self-reflexivity, as does the ex posure of the graphic and non-realistic nature of the animation and back grounds. This invites a mild Verfremdungseffekt (alienation effect) in which the viewer can emotionally distance him/herself from the narrative while retaining great empathy for Gerald's plight, allowing the spectator to be a conscious, critical viewer. Abraham compares the story to that of Disney's Dumbo in deal ing with the redemption of a downtrodden outcast. However, the depth of despair and alienation is much greater in Gerald than in Dumbo, and the former's minimalist animation offers symbolism and satire, but less maud lin sentiment than the Disney cartoon. Gerald has no mentors and support figures like the crows in Dumbo and Dumbo's mother, who wholly supports him though unable to help him. While Abraham's analysis of the cartoon's stylistic innovations is excellent, he does not adequately discuss its mean ing. Abraham gives much space to John Hubley's masterpiece, Rooty Toot Toot (1951), a retelling of the Frankie and Johnny folk ballad. Hubley constructed it like a jazz ballet with an original jazz score. However, Abra ham's allusion to a "Rashoman-like" structure doesn't work, because the witnesses' accounts agree with each other rather than differ. Abraham also fails to note that Hubley utilizes full animation in this cartoon in contrast</page><page sequence="5">193 with the limited animation in most other UPA fare. This enables him to con struct the film like a jazz ballet with unique movements for each character. For example, Frankie's lawyer pirouettes as he presents a defense for his client, a sign of his smugness and confidence. Colors are also indicative of character. The bar's walls are colored in a depressed light brown and Frankie is dressed in red, a sign of her anger and passionate nature. Her lawyer, nicknamed "Honest John," portrays her as "pure and demure" to the jury, and we are shown a sequence in which she and the background are all in white and she dances among flowers. However, some of the flowers are colored in the same sordid brown as walls of the courtroom, the bartender's body, and the faces of the jurors, indicating the tainted nature of all. Because he focuses on artistic techniques, Abraham fails to describe the meanings of the cartoon (e.g. Hubley presents a very cynical view of the law and the courts). He changes the conclusion to the song, adding a scene in which Frankie is exonerated by the jury, although plainly guilty. This reinforces the image of the injustice of the judicial system and the ability of lawyers to manipulate juries. After the verdict the courtroom is colored in red as it explodes in joyous celebration, including silhouettes of a jazz band playing hot music. But, Honest John takes up with Nelly and Frankie shoots him in a jealous rage as she did Johnny, proving her guilt conclusively. As the lawyer dies he gasps, "ipso facto, status quo, case closed" so obsessed by legal mumbo jumbo, and his job as lawyer, that he is unable to express any feeling, even about his impending death. With the exception of the Magoo series, Abraham presents no con textual readings of UPA films. However, such a reading of Rooty Toot Toot yields interesting additional meanings (Slade 1-4). The Frankie and Johnny ballad was based on a real incident that occurred in Saint Louis on October 16, 1899. Frankie, whose real name was Frankie Baker, was a black pros titute and Johnny (named Allen Britt) her black pimp. Britt had been seeing another woman, a prostitute named Alice Pryor, and threatened to leave Frankie. Frankie then started crying and started out the door when Allen threatened to kill her if she took another step. After he pulled out a knife and said he was going to cut her, Frankie shot him. The relationship had been an abusive one; he had beaten Frankie a few nights before. The jury found that the shooting was self-defense and acquitted her. At the time, the most lurid news stories were often subjects of popu lar song lyrics. By Christmas of that year Frankie had already heard "her" ballad being sung on the streets. Allen became rechristened in Frank and Bert Leighton's 1912 sheet music for their vaudeville song, "Frankie and Johnny." After Mae West made a movie about the event (She Done Him</page><page sequence="6">194 Wrong, 1933), Frankie sued Republic Studio because of its inaccurate por trayal of the murder, but to not avail. She sued Republic a second time after a film about her was released three years later, Frankie and Johnnie (1936) starring torch singer Helen Morgan. But the case was thrown out of court like the first one. Frustrated and feeling unalterably defamed, Frankie died in 1952 in a mental institution at the age of seventy-five. This historical context reveals the bias in the ballad: Frankie was not guilty of a revenge murder but was an abused woman acting in self defense. She and Johnny were both black, although all future incarnations of the story would portray them as white. The ballad universalizes gender and racial representations (white always taken as the norm), naturalizing them through historical de-specification, and erasing the act of rational self defense at the heart of actual incident. It affirms the stereotype that men are inherently philanderers and women prone to being emotionally volatile, and capable of irrational jealousy, even violence. Abraham tends to look upon modernism as a univocal term and this does not sufficiently describes the different types of modernisms in UPA films. In 1953, for example, designer Paul Julian and director Ted Parmelee adapted Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story, "The Tell-Tale Heart" for ani mation. This film is important because it shows the variety of modemist de vices that UPA used in their cartoons. An insane man, who insists upon his own sanity, kills the old man he has been living with. The old man's only offense is his possession of an unfortunate "vulture eye. " The film thus is about fears of difference and the felt need to eliminate the Other. The story is told through voice over and subjective shots so that the audience sees through the killer's eyes, and the protagonist's degenerating mental state is shown expressionistically through distorted background layouts created by Julian. There is only very limited animation in the film with the focus on Julian's dark, abstract paintings. Parmelee shows the old man's white dam aged eyeball in several close-ups to illustrate the madman's obsession with it and determination to get rid of it. The film evokes a form of synesthesia and uses surrealism and ex pressionism to capture the narrator's growing mental deterioration. One sequence shows the sound of the old man's heartbeat in the narrator's mind, represented by pulsating visuals that beat more rapidly as he becomes more obsessed by them. He is driven to kill the old man in order to eliminate them. When the police investigate, they are represented by close-ups of floating eyes, since the narrator imagines them to be able to perceive his guilt. Then he imagines hearing the sound of the old man's heart beating underneath the floor where he has buried the body and he has to confess his crimes to make</page><page sequence="7">195 it stop. Parmelee utilizes shots of water dripping on the table to give visual embodiment to the heartbeat's sounds in the narrator's mind. The film is a study in paranoia and the failed attempt to deny one's own abnormality by projecting it onto a despised Other. The film's use of subjective shots puts the viewer into the frame of mind as the protagonist, inviting him/her to question their own fears of difference and paranoid thoughts, an apt attempt to raise consciousness in an "Age of Anxiety." UPA created a heterogeneous set of styles, from the sunny, brightly colored film Madeline, inspired by a children's book series written by Lud wig Bemelmans, to the dark Gothicism of The Tale-Tale Heart, because of the non-hierarchical structure of UPA. As Abraham observes, after Steve Bustustow gained control of UPA, "he organized a structure in which he had almost no role and gave unprecedented freedom to . . . the animators and designers." "He did one thing right," the author concludes, "he let his art ists make their films" (231). In its heyday, UPA was thus truly an auteurist cinema. In part three of the book, entitled "Interruption," Abraham discusses The House Committee on Un-American Activities hearings of the postwar era and their effect on UPA. In the 1940s future UPA creators benefitted from political connections (being Roosevelt supporters and pro-union). But in the postwar era there was a more conservative mood in the country and these connections turned into liabilities. Anti-communist hysteria griped the country resulting in blacklists, the ruin of careers, and political perse cution—often spoken of under the term "McCarthyism" although it was HUAC that initiated the witch-hunts. Careers could be destroyed in the process. The Hollywood film writ ers, known as the "Hollywood Ten" went to prison for refusing to name names to the Committee. One of these was Ring Lardner, Jr., one of the au thors of UPA's 1945 film, Brotherhood of Man. "The word was around that we were a bunch of Reds," Bill Hurtz commented (Abraham 126). Colum bia Pictures established a "security department" to prevent communists and communist sympathizers from working on any of the studio's productions. If Bustustow wanted to hire anyone he had to clear it first with this depart ment. But matters got worse. In 1952 the studio drew up a list of eight UPA employees with supposed communist affiliations and demanded that they disavow their leftist associations and claim to be a "pure-blooded Ameri cans." Seven letters were submitted. However, Hubley refused to write a letter believing that it would violate his "freedom as an artist" to do so and would be an act of cowardice and deceit and in May 1952 he was fired from the studio. The FBI pursued Hubley for years until he finally testified</page><page sequence="8">196 before the Committee in 1956, refusing to confirm or deny his membership in the Communist Party. Having left UPA he launched a highly successful second career an independent animator in collaboration with his wife Faith, winning an Academy Award for The Hole (1962). "I think Johnny's life was made by the blacklist," Faith Hubley told an interviewer (qtd. in Abraham 134). This chapter reveals one problem with Abraham's book: his occa sional lack of aesthetic judgments at key moments and preference to quote conflicting viewpoints from UPA staff. For example, he is noncommittal on whether such firings hurt UPA, quoting artists with opposing positions. Herb Klynn argued that: "We didn't need Hubley" (qtd. in Abraham 134). But Bill Meldendez claimed that after Hubley's departure the UPA films de clined in quality. Steve Bostustow added that "I lost heart" after the purge, and that the studio was never the same (qtd. in Abraham 139). Part four, "Flight of Icarus" is the final section of the book and de scribes UPA's crescendo and eventual decline. Mr. Magoo became one of the most popular cartoon stars in the country in the 1950s and early six ties and Abraham devotes more space to interpreting the Magoo films than he does to other UPA works. His important insight is that "Mr. Magoo's best-remembered trait, his clinical blindness, is in fact his least interest ing " (Abraham 161). It is not his inability to see but his refusal to see the world as it is that distinguishes the Magoo films. He "perceives a world that everyone else—consumerist, suburban-migrating, baby-booming consum ers—fails to see" (Abraham 161). Abraham claims that Magoo's misin terpretations of the world are, in fact, a form of "insightful blindness," and that he sees a world that is better, more profound. However, this argument doesn't square with Magoo's repeated misrecognitions of everyday objects and people that provide the constant comedy of the films. Abraham is on firmer ground in claiming that Magoo is an "inner directed" personality" to use the term from David Riesman's Lonely Crowd. "Inner-directed" types were individualists who affirmed the Protestant Work Ethic and deferred gratification and carved a civilization out of the frontier, built business empires, and colonized "inferior" races. Riesman opposed this character type to the "other-directed personality" — "bureau cratized, suburban, and subject to peer pressure" in Abraham's words, who gets signals for what he believes from the peer groups and the mass media which indoctrinate him (163). Other contemporary social critics analyses confirmed this analysis, including William Whyte's "organization man" and C. Wright Mill's indictment of a "power elite" that mied America.</page><page sequence="9">197 However, Abraham does not sufficiently ground his analysis in the Magoo films and explain how this analytic dichotomy works, nor place his interpretations in historical context. When one analyzes these films one can see that it is the way the films foreground the contradictions between tradi tional American values and American modernity that provide the subtext for the Magoo films. We must avoid interpreting Magoo's blindness as a form of special insight, as Abraham does, lest we fall back into the nostalgia for rural, small-town America that Disney revered and UPA tried to overcome. Writing in 1953, David Fisher observed that Magoo operates in a contemporary situation that Disney's heroes no longer inhabit: "Mr. Ma goo represents for us the man who would be responsible and serious in a world that seems insane; he is a creature of the 1950s, the Age of Anxiety; his situation reflects our own" (218). I would suggest that Magoo symbol izes the powerless, alienated citizen at the mercy of the bureaucracies and corporations that hold America in their grip. In The Dog Snatcher (1955), for example, Magoo is plagued by an obsessive dogcatcher who gives Ma goo until 12 o'clock to get a license or his dog Cuddles will be impounded. Magoo curses "bureaucracy" and "red tape" and angrily trucks off to city hall to see the mayor in protest. But Magoo mistakes a man-eating panther from the circus as Cuddles and the dogcatcher ends up trying to prevent the vicious beast from attacking him, enabling Magoo's dog to go free. The film illustrates the formula that all Magoo films would follow: no matter how confused he is, Magoo always triumphs in the end. Magoo's Private War (1957) is an even more acerbic satire of fifties America. Magoo is a civil defense captain for his neighborhood. He blurts out his intention to subject his subordinates to "basic training" and "work, work, work," expressing the macho, tough-minded ethic of "inner-directed man." As Pete Burness, the director of the Magoo films, notes the old codger is "very civic minded." Magoo always intends to protect his community, but his misperceptions undermine his aims. Magoo mistakes the premiere of a science fiction film about the invasion of America by space aliens with the newsreels he sees in a movie theater. Animators mixed real-life news reels of "military maneuvers" to give the scenes credibility. "What a holo caust!" Magoo declares and blows his whistle to warn his fellow Americans in the theater. Every few minutes he phones a general at headquarters on his walkie-talkie to the consternation of an usher who tries to stop him. The cartoon metaphorically satirizes the Cold War militarism and paranoia of the times that were premised on fears of a Communist invasion. Magoo films even occasionally satirized themselves, I would sug gest. In the Academy Award-winning short When Magoo Flew (1954), the</page><page sequence="10">198 old duffer mistakes an airplane trip for a 3-D film, a new type of cinema at the time. A poster reveals that its title is for the UPA film The Tell-Tale Heart that was released about this time and was supposed to be in 3-D but Columbia prohibited it. Magoo mistakes a door on the plane for an eleva tor, ending up on the wing of the plane, and then shows up in the cockpit's windshield to the horror of the pilot. Meanwhile, inside, a cop, is looking for a teller who has absconded with some bonds. The film parodies the tele vision show Dragnet, then a rage among viewers, and the clipped dialogue for which Joe Friday was famous. In the end Magoo inadvertently helps capture the criminal by returning the briefcase that teller has tried to ditch. After Magoo departs, He tells the stewardess that he hopes that they won't play any of "those ridiculous cartoons about a nearsighted old man," i.e. about himself. In this cartoon UPA incorporated modernism's self-reflexiv ity to gently satirize film fads and shifting consumer tastes. The latter part of the last section of the book describes UPA's decline in the late fifties and early sixties. By the mid-fifties there was a coarsening of the Magoo product, claims Abraham. And in 1953, when they signed their second five-year contract, UPA faced restraints from the studio and had to get permission to make any non-Magoo shorts. Columbia also made them lessen the footage they could make by fifty feet, losing a minute and a half from seven-minute cartoons. "If the early fifties were, for UPA, the years of innovation and conquest," writes Abraham, "then the late fifties were the years of debacle and retreat" (206). By 1959, most of UPA's lead ing lights were gone: Hubley, Eastman, Julian, Permadee, Melendez, Stur tevant, Burness, and Cannon. UPA had struggled for years trying to make an animated feature film because it was more profitable than selling shorts. The 1001 Arabian Nights of Mr. Magoo was released in 1959 but had mixed reviews. The producer admitted they had story problems and that trying to do a feature film around a character with a limited formula may have been a problem. In 1960, Bustustow sold UPA to producer Harry Saperstein. Saperstein quit dong theatrical films to focus on television and mass-produced cartoon shorts without the concern for artistry and creativity that had defined the studio's history. UPA's career in television was a brief and not altogether a happy one with a cancellation of the Gerald Mc Boing Boing Show after one season and the production of a series of lackluster Dick Tracy shorts. Nevertheless, UPA has had a tremendous influence on both theatrical and television animation. Its stylized, limited animation became de rigueur in television and its low-budget, commercialized series. However, limited animation could be used for quality productions as well: Bill Scott, for</page><page sequence="11">199 mer storyman at UPA, became Jay Ward's partner and co-producer of the satirical Rocky and Bullwinkle shows for television. Ward Kimball even won an Academy Award for the Disney Studio for their production of Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom (1959), a tale about the origins of music, inspired by UPA's modernism. UPA also inspired the Croatian Film company Zagreb to produce abstract films with complex symbolic and political meanings. Abraham's book offers an excellent studio history of UPA, its per sonal and artistic techniques. However, Abraham fails to frame UPA's mod ernism as a rejection of the realist discourses that Disney animation made hegemonic at its height. Disney wished to replicate the conventions of the live-action film. He tried to create what he called an "illusion of life'" in his animated films, not so much a mirror of reality but to endow his char acters with verisimilitude. To do this he insisted that animators use tech niques of secondary motion (having a character's clothes follow at differ ent speeds when they moved), multicolored paints to give characters three dimensionality, and the multiplane camera (layers of backgrounds painted onto glass and photographed while superimposed over one another) to give backgrounds greater depth and to suggest three-dimensionality. The height of Disney's realism was its naturalistic rendition of deer in Bambi in which artists studied real-life animals and tried to duplicate aspects of their move ment and behavior. While Abraham mentions some of these techniques he does not thematize them in terms of the movement towards realism and how this undermines the artistic potential of animation. Related to this realist style is Disney's development of what he called "personality animation," giving distinctive motivations to characters to promote audience identifica tion with them. However, the attempt to invoke audience empathy for char acters led to a skirting of evil and tragedy and an emphasis on the overly cute and sentimental in Disney films from Snow White on. Disney's attempt to emulate the live-action film had the effect of suppressing the intrinsic nature of animation which is based on graphics and composed of lines on paper or cell. This graphic nature of animation was emphasized in all early animation. Characters like Felix the Cat, or the early Mickey Mouse, could take off their ears or stretch their arms like rub ber bands; machines could turn into human beings, and anthropomorphic animals could become machines. One of the essential properties of anima tion is metamorphosis, the ability of forms to be transformed into other, completely different forms. It was this fluid type of animation that Sergei Eisenstein called "plasmaticness" and made it a medium that potentially could resist all fixity and stability. Animation was a Utopian language that was liberating because of its "rejection of once-and-forever allotted form,</page><page sequence="12">200 freedom from ossification, the ability to dynamically assume any form" (Lyda 21). According to Eisenstein, the animated medium appealed to pri mal impulses in the human psyche, grounded in evolutionary principles, and had revolutionary implications. Disney's embrace of realism in his later work limited these core attributes of animation and his great influence made this type of realism canonical. It was this influence that UPA sought to over come. Despite its flaws, When Magoo Flew is an excellent studio history and is indispensible to anyone wishing to explore one of the greatest Ameri can animation studios.
