<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Assessment of Religious Conflicts and their Resolutions MICHAEL E. NIELSENt Religious conflicts were explored in a sample of 202 adults, 132 of whom provided written descrip- tions of conflicts they considered to be religious in nature. The majority of conflicts involved other people, but the resolution of the conflict did not. Participants also completed Hunt's Literal, Antiliteral and Mythological scales of religiousness. Mythological scores were significantly greater among people who had experienced conflict than among those who had not. No reliable differences in Literal and Antiliteral scores were observed between participants who have experienced religious conflict and those who have not. Conflicts that people have had can be influential experiences, remembered for many years. For example, Viktor Frankl's (1959) experience in a Nazi concentration camp had a profound effect on him. Indeed, the influence of his years in a camp has extended beyond Frankl's own life, as people have read his account of life in a World War II concentration camp or have undergone the form of therapy that he developed as a result of his experi- ences. Of course, the impact of such conflicts sometimes is negative. Among the reasons cited by Bertrand Russell (1957) for opposing religion is his observation that religion spawns many interpersonal conflicts. War, intolerance and hatred - all conflicts in the name of religion - suggest to Russell that religion has done more harm than good to society and its members. The present paper explores religious conflict - conflict that occurs in a religious setting or has religious overtones. In particular, I wished to examine the scope and range of people's religious conflicts. Do people recognize both interpersonal and intrapersonal relig- ious conflicts? Do conflicts arise more over thoughts than over actions? How are conflicts resolved? These are questions that I wished to investigate in the present study. Researchers have considered conflicts at different levels of analysis, ranging from interpersonal conflicts involving many people, to intrapersonal or intrapsychic conflicts involving only the individual. Most broadly conceived, religions may conflict with their host culture (Hampshire and Beckford 1983). Somewhat more narrow are conflicts between vari- ous religious groups. Examples of the variety of religious groups considered by researchers include conflicts between Muslims and Jews (Gurevitch 1989; Rouhana and Fiske 1995; Tabory 1993), Christians and Zen Buddhists (Henderson 1982), and Hindus and Muslims (Saxena and Sharma 1980). More narrowly, conflict may occur within a group, as when denominations within the same religion conflict with one another (Gough et al. 1992; Henderson 1982; McAllister 1982). Within a denomination, clergy may conflict with laity (Hirschorn 1992; Hoge and Faue 1973), or there may be disagreements regarding group boundaries and group member- ship (Gordon 1989; Gurevitch 1989; Tabory 1993). Still more narrowly conceived, an individual's conflicting thoughts have been investi- gated (Kojetin et al. 1987; Nielsen and Fultz 1995). One useful perspective that researchers t Michael E.

For example, White and White (1995) used the cognitive dissonance perspective to understand individuals' con- flicting beliefs about themselves and about their church's practices and policies. White and White examined interviews with Mormons who, because of their race, were excluded from full participation in their church. The interviews revealed several different strategies used to reduce dissonance between their views of themselves as individuals worthy of God's blessing, and the knowledge that they could not participate completely in all functions of their chosen church. Nielsen and Fultz (1995) addressed the links between religious orientation and relig- ious conflict. In that study, quest and social-extrinsic orientations correlated positively with various forms of conflict, but intrinsic orientation scores tended to be negatively correlated with conflict. Similar research regarding individuals' values suggests that people with an intrinsic orientation toward values experienced low levels of conflict among their values, whereas extrinsically oriented individuals showed greater value conflict (Peck 1989). Although theorists have identified these various levels at which conflict may occur, research has yet to address some basic questions: What proportion of people describe themselves as having religious conflicts? To what extent do religious conflicts involve oneself only, and to what extent do they involve other people? Are religious conflicts viewed as being primarily negative or positive? A primary purpose of this study was to begin to examine these descriptive questions. A second aspect of this study was to assess people's conflicts in light of their scores on Hunt's (1972a) Literal, Antiliteral, Mythological (LAM) view of religiousness. Using the example of a college student whose endorsement of literal or fundamentalist religious statements decreases through college, Hunt suggests that the person may not be less relig- ious, but merely less fundamentalist. The student's symbolic interpretation of scripture may in fact have increased. Hunt (1972b) asserts that scales measuring religiousness tend to focus on fundamentalist views of religion, to the exclusion of the metaphorical. The LAM is designed to remedy this pattern by spanning dimensions from literal to symbolic and relig- ious to antireligious (Hunt 1993). Hunt's approach was commended at the outset for offering a new perspective (Greeley 1972), and has continued to receive praise for rising above the common "narrowness of con- ceptualization" (Wulff 1991: 215) plaguing scales of religiosity. Still, there is surprisingly little research using this instrument. Poythress (1975) found that more than one-quarter of his sample (28%) had a mythological approach to religion, supporting the idea that scales focusing on fundamentalism or literalism fail to capture a significant segment of the popula- tion. Hunt and King (1978), using a shortened version of the LAM, demonstrated that mari- tal happiness was positively correlated with Mythological scale scores, and negatively correlated with Literal scale scores. More recently, cross-cultural differences were demonstrated using the scale by Northover and Gonzalez (1993), who found that Spanish students were less literal, and more antireligious, than Canadian students. Also recently, van der Lans (1991; van der Lans and RooiJackers 1994) has begun projects translating and modifying Hunt's LAM scale from its original Christian wording into Hindu and Islamic versions. After modifying Hunt's "mythological" scale to "metaphorical," van der Lans found a general trend for higher levelb of religious judgment among metaphorical subjects, compared to Literal subjects, and that older subjects tended toward literal thinking, whereas younger subjects tended toward metaphorical thinking. Van der Lans and Rooijackers (1994) report that among their sample of second-generation Turkish Muslims living in the Netherlands, metaphorical views appeared to cause tension. The notion that tension may be associated with various beliefs is tested in the present study. Supporting rationale is found in Kirkpatrick, Hood, and Hartz's (1991) discussion of</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS AND RESOLUTIONS 183 Rokeach's (1960) theory of open and closed belief systems. In this conceptualization, closed belief systems contain certain core beliefs which act as focal points, and peripheral beliefs relate to each other only through the core beliefs. To an outside observer various peripheral beliefs might seem to conflict with one another, but to the person with the closed belief sys- tem they do not conflict because they do not directly relate to one another. In contrast, the person with an open belief system is more likely to experience conflict between beliefs because the peripheral beliefs may associate directly with each other. In Hunt's scales, items comprising the Literal and Antiliteral perspectives suggest rela- tively closed belief systems. That is, certain religious tenets literally are or are not true, and this central belief filters other, more peripheral beliefs. This is contrasted with the more open belief system suggested by mythological scale items that, for example, combine the notion that God is an anthropomorphic way of viewing creative processes, with the idea that miracles are initiated by God using natural processes. Such ideas as these exist alongside one another in the relatively open, decentralized perspective of the mythological. To the extent that mythological scores reflect an open belief system, I predicted that mythological scores would be greater among subjects who have experienced conflict than among subjects who have not. No differences between subjects who have and have not experienced religious conflict were expected on Literal and Antiliteral scale scores. METHOD Participants A convenience sample of 202 adults, consisting of 113 females, 81 males, and 8 who did not identify their gender, was obtained. Mean age was 34.4 years, and ranged from 18 to 66. Participants were primarily white (67%), but included blacks (30%) and hispanics (3%). The most commonly reported religious affiliations of participants were Baptist (39%), Methodist (15%), Catholic (12%), Presbyterian (7%), and none (9%). Other reported affilia- tions included African-Methodist-Episcopal, Christian, Church of God, Church of the Brethren, Congregationalist, Disciples of Christ, Episcopalian, Jehovah's Witness, Jewish, Lutheran, Nondenominational, Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and Unitarian- Universalist. Measures and Procedure After obtaining informed consent, participants completed a questionnaire that solic- ited demographic information and frequency of personal prayer and church attendance. Participants next responded to the following item: People experience conflict in many different forms. For example, an individual may feel conflict between competing ideas, or between actions or behaviors that seem inconsisent. A person also might experience conflict with another person, group or organization. This portion of the questionnaire concerns conflicts that people have in a religious setting or with religious overtones. Please describe an experience in which you personally have felt conflict in a religious setting or with religious overtones. Please include as much information as possible; use additional paper if necessary. Begin by describing what brought about the con- flict. After responding to this item, participants described if and how the conflict was resolved. Next, participants indicated how important the conflict experience was at the time it occurred, as well as how important it is now, on scales ranging from 1 (Not At AU) to 7 (Very). Finally, respondents completed Hunts (1972a) LAM scale, which was scored in the forced-choice format used by Hunt.</page><page sequence="4">184 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION RESULTS One-hundred and thirty-two participants (65%) responded to the item by describing a religious conflict; the remaining 70 participants either indicated that they have had no religious conflicts or left the item blank. Responses to the question asking participants to describe a religious conflict were transcribed onto a computer file for later coding. Passages ranged from 1 to 19 sentences in length, M = 5.0, SD = 3.2. Type of Conflict Conflicts were assessed by two raters who categorized each sentence as focusing on either the writer's own thoughts, the writer's actions, another person's thoughts, or another's actions. Interrater agreement for this task was 90.7%; failure to reach agreement was resolved by discussion between the two raters.1 Examples of conflicts that illustrate each of these four themes are shown in Appendix A. The proportion of sentences focused on Person (self vs. other) and Conflict Type (thought vs. act) were analyzed using analysis of variance, with both factors serving as within-subjects factors. Results showed significant main effects for Person, F (1, 131) = 32.94, p &lt; .001, MSE = .07, partial w2 = .10, and for Conflict Type, F (1, 131) = 19.14, p &lt; .00 1, MSE = .06, partial w2 = .07.2 These were qualified by a significant Person X Conflict Type interaction, F (1, 131) = 127.98, p &lt; .001, MSE = .04, partial w2 = .19. In describing their religious conflicts, subjects wrote most frequently about their own thoughts (M = .46, SD = .25) than their own actions (M = .17, SD = .18), and were more likely to write about someone elseds acts (M = .24, SD = .22) than about someone else's thoughts (M = .14, SD = .16). This pattern is consistent with the 'Actor-Observer Difference" (Jones and Nisbett 1972). In order to better understand the nature of the conflicts, a second pair of raters independently assessed each sentence for the presence or absence of conflict. If conflict was present, the raters judged whether the source of conflict was (a) the writer's own ideas, (b) the writer's ideas and actions, (c) another person, or (d) a group of people. Raters thus placed each sentence into one conflict category, or into a "no conflict" category. Raters agreed on 95.4% of the sentences; disagreements were resolved by discussion. Analysis of these data was done using a within-subjects ANOVA, with one factor having five levels cor- responding to the various conflict types. Results showed a significant difference in the pro- portion of sentences concerned with these various types of conflict, F (1, 131) = 32.91, p &lt; .001, MSE = .09, partial ci = .15. A tukey test, with alpha set at .01, showed that conflicts between ideas (M = .07, SD = .17) and ideas and actions (M = .03, SD = .14) occurred less often than did conflicts involving another person (M = .23, SD = .32) or grouip of people (M = .37, SD = .35), which were significantly different from each other. Sentences not involving conflict (M = .31, SD = .27) also were more common than those involving conflict between ideas or actions, but were just as common as sentences involving interpersonal conflict. These results suggest that interpersonal conflict was common in the narratives collected among these subjects, and that the high number of statements that participants made about themselves, found by the first pair of raters, tended not to convey conflict. Resolution of Conflict Resolutions to the conflicts also were analyzed for the proportion of sentences in which the participants described their own or another's thoughts and actions. The same pair of raters who excamined conflicts for this Person X Conflict Type distinction also rated the resolutions. Resolutions were rated aftser all conflict were rated; interrater agreement was</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS AND RESOLUTIONS 185 90.1%. As with the descriptions of conflict, the proportion of sentences that focused on each of the four Person (self vs. other) X Conflict Type (thought vs. act) cells were subjected to a within-subjects ANOVA. Analysis revealed a significant effect for Person, F (1, 123) = 231.22, p &lt; .00 1, MSE = .06, partial co2 = .47, and a marginal effect for Conflict Type, F (1, 123) = 3.81, p = .053, MSE = .12, partial w2 = .01. These factors also yielded a significant interaction, F (1, 123) = 13.73, p &lt; .001, MSE = .11, partial d2 = .025. Cell means indicate that participants seldom perceived the resolution of conflict to have involved another per- son, as other person's thoughts (M = .06, SD = .12) and actions (M = .11, SD = .20) were mentioned infrequently. Instead, they tended to resolve conflicts themselves, usually cognitively (M = .50,SD = .35) but about one-third of the time by performing some action (M = .33, SD = .33).3 Importance of Religious Conflicts Participants rated the importance of the conflict to their spirituality at the time the event occurred, and at the present time, on scales ranging from 1 (Not At All Important) to 7 (Very Important). These data were analyzed in a mixed factorial ANOVA, with Time (then vs. now) as a within-subjects factor, and participant gender4 as a between-subjects factor. Conflicts were rated as being more important at the time they occurred (M = 4.55, SD = 1.98) than they were at the present time (M = 3.78, SD = 2.25), F (1, 118) = 15.02,p &lt; .00 1, partial 2 = .05.5 Gender failed to affect ratings of importance. Conflict and LAM Ratings Participants also completed Hunt's (1972a) LAM scale. LAM scores were calculated by summing the number of times each type of item was endorsed. These data were analyzed with a 2 (Conflict: conflict vs. no conflict) X 2 (Gender: female vs. male) X 3 (LAM scale: lit- eral vs. antiliteral vs. mythological) ANOVA, with LAM scale serving as a within-subjects factor. Results of the ANOVA showed a significant main effect for LAM scale, F (2, 380) = 79.55, p &lt; .001, MSE = 25.11, partial w2 = .21, qualified by a significant LAM X Conflict interaction, F (2, 380) = 3.42, p = .034, MSE = 25.11, partial d2 = .004. Planned comparisons were used to examine differences between subjects who stated that they had experienced a religious conflict and those who had not. I predicted that, compared to people who did not have a religious conflict, people who had experienced a religious conflict would show higher scores on the Mythological scale. Furthermore, I expected to find no differences between the two groups in terms of their Literal and Antiliteral scores. The predicted significant differ- ence in Mythological scores was supported, F (1, 190) = 6.09, p = .01, MSE = 13.79, partial c = .0 13, with scores higher among those who reported a conflict (M = 6.03, SD = 3.82) than among those who did not (M = 4.59, SD = 3.42). There were no reliable differences between the conflict (M = 8.28, SD = 5.27) and no conflict (M = 9.66, SD = 5.09) groups in terms of their Literal scores, F (1, 190) = 3.14, p = .078, MSE = 27.27, partial w2 = .006, and Antiliteral scores, F (1, 190) &lt; 1, ns (Ms = 2.04 and 1.89, SDs = 3.42 and 2.80 for the conflict and no conflict groups, respectively). Thus, the expected links between LAM scores and religious conflict were demonstrated. In order to better understand LAM scores more generally, correlations between LAM and other variables were examined. Specifically, correlations of LAM scores with subject age, weekly personal religious activity (prayer or meditation), and monthly public religious activity (church attendance) were computed for all participants. Several additional variables relevant to the conflict were explored among participants who described a religious conflict: the number of years ago that the conflict occurred, its importance at the t;ime, its impor-</page><page sequence="6">186 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION tance now, the intensity of the conflict, and the self-rated degree to which the conflict had a negative or positive effect on the participant's life.6 Results of these correlational analyses suggest that the Literal and Antiliteral views mirror one another. As would be expected, Literalism is more apparently devout than is antiliteralism. Literalism correlated positively with frequency of prayer and frequency of church attendance, rs = .47 and .36, ps &lt; .01. Antiliteralism correlated negatively with frequency of prayer and frequency of church attendance, rs = -.38 and -.28, ps &lt; .01. The same pattern held true for ratings of how important the conflict was at the time it occurred; literalism scores correlated positively with the rated importance, r = .29, whereas anti- literalism was negatively related to importance, r = -.31, ps &lt; .01. Antiliteral scores also showed a low but significant negative correlation with the perceived positive impact of the conflict, r = -.17, p &lt; .05. Mythological score correlations generally resemble Antiliteral score correlations more than they do Literal. Higher agreement with mythological statements is negatively corre- lated with frequency of prayer and churchgoing, rs = -.31 and -.28, ps &lt; .01. Mythological scale scores failed to correlate significantly with the other variables. It should be noted that these patterns undoubtedly are influenced by the ipsative nature of the LAM scales, and should be replicated by more independent scoring methods (e.g., Poythress 1975). Keeping that in mind, these results suggest that the Literal scale reflects an active, faithful approach to religion, while the Antiliteral scale reflects a negative view. Mythological scores were associated with having experienced conflict and with low levels of involvement in per- sonal or public religion. DISCUSSION When asked to describe a religious conflict, nearly two-thirds of the participants in this research did so. Conflicts frequently were interpersonal in nature, but most often were resolved intrapersonally. Participants usually resolved the conflict by altering their own thoughts; less often, the participants performed some action that reduced conflict. Only rarely did participants indicate that another person's thoughts or acts were responsible for reducing the conflict. Of course, these observations are based on only one person's percep- tion of the conflict. In those situations in which conflict involved more than one individual, it may well be that the other person would make a similar observation! Ideally, future research will investigate the perceptions of all people involved in an interpersonal conflict. The finding that conflicts seldom were resolved in ways that involved another person is consistent with other recent research. For example, interactions between religious and nonreligious youth in Israel are characterized by avoidance (Tabory 1993). Similarly, in research focused on the conflict behaviors and attitudes among black Seventh-day Adventists, Howard (1989) found that people claim to view conflict as valuable and appro- priate, but interact in such a way as to avoid conflict. As Tabory (1993) and Howard (1989) note, avoidance reduces conflict at the expense of increased misperceptions -and increased risk of conflict - making avoidance a questionable strategy for dealing with conflicts. Hunt's (1972a) LAM scales were useful in distinguishing subjects who experienced conflict from those who did not. Specifically, high Mythological scale scores were associated with greater conflict. Although this effect was modest, the nature of a Mythological orienta- tion toward religion deserves further investigation. For example, longitudinal research would help greatly in our attempts to understand how conflicts affect one's beliefs regarding scripture, clergy, and other aspects tapped by the Mythological scale. Research investigating the similarities of the LAM and other, more commonly used measures of religious orienta- tion (i.e., Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Quest) also would help to build construct validity for the LAM. In particular, possible links between the mythological and quest onientations mnay be</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS AND RESOLUTIONS 187 worth examining. Mythological scores were greater among people who reported religious conflicts in this sample; similarly, quest scores also are positively correlated with conflict (Kojetin et al. 1987; Nielsen and Fultz 1995). Further examination of the similarities and differences between the mythological and quest approaches to religion may prove to be enlightening. These conclusions are tempered by several factors. The wording of the item soliciting religious conflicts may have influenced responses by emphasizing interpersonal conflict over intrapersonal/intrapsychic conflict. Also limiting these results is the use of a convenience sample, which constrains the generalizability of these results. On a more fundamental level, the vast majority of participants in this research were Christians in a predominantly Christian country, and this no doubt circumscribes the gen- eralizability of the findings to other religious and cultural populations. Also relevant is the observation that the three orientations present in Hunt's scales are not exhaustive (Wulff 1991). Consequently, interpersonal and intrapsychic conflicts are addressed to varying degrees, and improving upon this may yield different results. Future research should be designed to overcome these limitations. Finally, the effect of religious denomination on mythological scores and on conflict was not controlled in this study. Research by van der Lans and Jablonski (1994) indicates that involvement in religious groups accounts for preferences between literal and mythological scale items. It is possible that denominations vary in terms of how much they encourage metaphorical thought, as well as the degree of conflict experienced by their members. Future research in this area is warranted. Rokeach's (1960) theory of open and closed belief systems could provide a useful framework for such a project. For example, one can conceive of differences in the kinds of conflicts experienced by Unitarian-Universalists and Southern Baptists; these groups also would be expected to differ in the extent to which literal and mythological thinking is encouraged. Longitudinal research would enable one to demon- strate, for example, that open-minded people experience greater intrapsychic conflicts, and that they are therefore drawn more to Unitarian-Universalism than to some other denomi- nation, and that their mythological thought increases after joining that group.7 The nature of conflictual thought is another area that deserves further investigation. Pratt, Hunsberger, Pancer, and Roth (1992) found people's thought about dilemmas involving personal conflicts to be more complex than thoughts about hypothetical dilemmas or nonconflictful events. These dilemmas also were rated as generating more personal reflection than did the nonconflictful or hypothetical dilemmas. An interesting question is whether mythological thought is more complex than literal or antiliteral, and whether it is characteristic of a situation (the context, or a type of thought) or of a person (e.g., a person- ality trait). This also might be useful in clarifying the open vs. closed mind distinction dis- cussed by Kirkpatrick, Hood, and Hartz (1991). Interpersonal conflict was common in the descriptions that I found in this study, but it is represented only indirectly in Funk's (1967) religious conflict scale, and in research building on that approach (Kojetin et al. 1987; Nielsen and Fultz 1995). A broader perspec- tive is needed in psychological research examining religious conflict. Even such formidable theories as cognitive dissonance have proven useful in addressing intrapsychic religious con- flict, but appear to leave interpersonal conflict unaddressed. Theory and research that inte- grates various forms of conflict will be important steps toward understanding religious conflict.</page><page sequence="8">188 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION NOTES An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, October, 1995, St. Louis, MO. 1 I had planned to have raters assess the conflict passage as a whole, but it proved too difficult for raters to reach an acceptable level of agreement using the entire passage as the unit of analysis. 2 Partial 02 is recommended by Keppel (1991) for computing effect size in designs that include within-subjects effects. 3 Eight participants did not describe how the conflict was resolved. 4 Gender was included in this and later analyses for exploratory purposes only. 5 Twelve subjects omitted either their gender or one of the importance ratings. 6 Degrees of freedom for these correlations are 201 in analyses involving all subjects, and 131 in analyses involving only subjects who described a conflict. In a few cases, the df are slightly lower due to missing data. 7 An anonymous reviewer's suggestion regarding this possibility is gratefully acknowledged. REFERENCES Festinger, L. 1957.

APPENDIX A The following transcribed conflicts are representative of the conflicts that fit the various Person X Conflict Type categories. The sentence(s) that illustrates the particular form of conflict is italicized, but because ratings were at the level of sentences, these examples also contain sentences that are coded under other categories. Subject #482 - Conflict Caused by Another Person's Thoughts My grandmother is a devout Southern Baptist. She attends church every time the doors are open. She is a very warm, loving woman, but she believes that if you are not a protestant, preferably Baptist, that you are bound for hell. I cannot imagine such! I am not a very religious person today for the simple reason that there are certain religious organizations out there that are teaching this blissfully ignorant logic. Subject #498- Conflict Caused by Writer's Own Thoughts A[nl inner-conflict I have with religion is the concept of will. God's will versus my own will and control over my life ha8 confused me for a very long time. I was taught that my own self was all I could depend on in this world and I can do and be whatever I want. My question was, do I give up my life and my will over to God and let him run my life[?] Well, I don't think so. Subject #671 - Conflict Caused by Other's Actions I was attending a church service for Christmas Eve and as always, anticipating a "packed house." I arrived at church at least one hour before the service was to begin. As I was sitting in church, admiring how beautiful and festive the altar and church looked, and thinking about the spiritual happiness and contentment I felt, the 80 called 'Catholics' began to arrive. I began to lose my concentration and became distracted by the goings on in the church, or should I say 'theater.' While most of the congregation was at peace with themselves and the Lord, several of the 'twice a year Catholics,' (so caled because they only attend church during Christmas and Easter Holidays) seemed to be in a conflict either with themaelves or with the people they were with. Most of them, annoyed that there weren't too many seats, left.. . or began talking, laughing orjust looking around to see who was arriving later than themselves. As I sat, I becanm aggravated at the lack of respect these people had for the house of the Lord and the true reason for being at church on Christmas Eve. As the mass began, these two timers showed little, if any interest in the prayers they were reciting, songs they were singing or parables they were listening to. I became frustrated, I felt like standing up and telling these people to leave and asking them why bother going to church if you are not there to worship and enjoy the true meaning of Christmas.</page><page sequence="10">190 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION APPENDIX A (Continued) Subject #271 - Conflict Caused by Writer's Own Acts I was attending a Braves baseball game one Thursday night. We were seated next to two drunk individuals. Something happened during the game that the two individuals found to their disliking. One of the individuals yelled out "God damnit" many times. I turned to the individual and asked him why he said that, and if he had accepted Jesus Christ as his savior. He turned to me and shoved his chili dog in my face. I took this as a sign that he did not accept Jesus Christ as his savior and continued to enjoy the ball game.</page></plain_text>
