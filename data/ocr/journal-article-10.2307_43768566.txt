The subject was proposed to me by the late Professor E.R. Dodds, and anything in the book of value may be taken as a dedication to him. Over the years, I have been helped by many people, too many in fact to cite. I have, as the occasion arose, thanked these people individually, so perhaps they will not mind if I do not do so here. I am sure that no one will take it amiss if I single out two people for special mention: D.M. Lewis, who was my supervisor, and upon whose advice and encouragement I have often relied (and whose patience I must surely have tried, at least some- times, although one would never have known it); and P. Roesch, whose help and generosity in making available to me much unpublished epigraphical material have been invaluable. I should also like to thank the anonymous reader for the Canadian Federation for the Humanities, for her or his useful comments on the material in this volume. My research was supported by grants from a number of sources (the Sir Arthur Sims Scholarship Fund, the Craven Committee, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Institute of Classical Studies, McGill University), and I am very grateful to them all. Most of the work was done in three libraries: those of the Ashmolean Museum, the Institute of Classical Studies, and McGill University. I am very grateful to them too for assistance and facilities generously provided. Finally, a word of thanks to my publishers, and especially to the people involved in the physical pro- duction of the book. They could not have been more helpful, or more forbearing. I only hope the result is worth it. McGill University December 1980 ix</page><page sequence="5">NOTE Because of the size of the book, it has been decided to publish the present volumes now, with the rest to follow in the not too distant future. The Index of Inscriptions published here applies to all the cults, not only to those from Acheloos to Hera. Other indexes will be printed at the end of the work. My present volumes take into account all relevant publications known to me up to late 1 979 , with some additions from 1980. X</page><page sequence="6">INTRODUCTION This is a book about the cults of Boiotia. It is not a study of ancient Greek religion in general, or of the religious ideas of the ancient Boiotians, or even of Boiotian myths. It is a series of articles analys- ing the evidence - epigraphical, literary, numismatic, artistic, archaeological - which I have been able to collect about the individual cults. Where it was possible, I have tried to trace the development of the cults, and to set them in their historical and social context. At the end of the book the different strands are tied together in an attempt to present a synopsis of religious practices in Boiotia. I do not deal with the Mycenaean period, except in passing, and, such is the nature of the surviving evidence, certain periods - the fifth century B.C., the Hellenistic and Roman imperial eras - are dealt with more thoroughly than others. "Personal religion" among the Boiotians also receives relatively short shrift here, once again because of the nature of the evidence. The book is, in brief, largely an evaluation of the official aspect of religious practices in Boiotia. There are numerous studies which deal with particular problems in Greek religion, and there have been several which take a regional approach to the religion of the Greeks, but many books about Greek religion try to present the subject as a unity. This general approach, while none would deny its value, runs the risk of presenting a distorted, or even oversimplified, picture of the religious life of a society which, while it shared many important cultural characteristics, was nevertheless fragmented politically and ethnically. One often finds, in reading books about Greek religion, that the evidence is gathered indiscriminately from all parts and from a wide chronological range, to arrive at a synopsis which, while it may be aesthetically satisfying, does not sufficiently take into account local variations and changing times. In trying to correct this imbalance, I have probably, on occasion, gone too far towards the other extreme, in presenting the evidence for individual cults more or less in isolation. In the final chapter, some attempt is made to correct this aberration by bringing together what I regard as the salient features of Boiotian cult topography. But the real work of synthesis can only begin when all regions of the ancient Greek world have been subjected to the same kind of minute study as I have tried to apply to Boiotia. It has been my experience that looking at the cults in their local and chronological context can pro- duce interesting and, at times, surprising results. It may happen that things which have hitherto been unclear become comprehensible when seen against their appropriate background. Then again, I have often found it necessary to reject accepted interpretations of data, either because they seem to be wrong in the local context, or because evidence provided by other kinds of testimonia suggests a different inter- pretation. A study of individual cults also brings into prominence shared characteristics, leading to the identification of "cult types" peculiar to limited geographical areas. This kind of result can be useful to the historian, as can the study of local cults in general. One may ask whether the choice of a single region for study is justified, and on what grounds. To the first question I would reply that any study which deals with local phenomena can be worthwhile, if only as a counterbalance to more generalized studies. The answer to the second is provided by the ancient Greeks themselves: one is justified in studying ancient Boiotia, for example, as an entity, because the Boiotians themselves, and their fellow Greeks, regarded Boiotia as a separate place. It had its own dialect, and its own political, social, and cultural institutions, among which must be placed the religious xi</page><page sequence="7">activity of the people who lived in Boiotia. An analysis of the religious practices of a single region can serve two purposes; first, it may help to clarify the history and culture of the region itself; second, it may provide material for contrast and comparison with the evidence from other parts of the Greek world, which it, in turn, may help to elucidate. Even if it is agreed that a local or regional approach is justified, this particular book might be criticised as being superficial, as it does not come to grips with religious sentiment, but only with religious practice. To this I would reply that perhaps too many of our ideas about Greek religious sentiments are based on faulty interpretation of the data (faulty in the sense that it does not take into account the nature of the evidence, its purpose, its historical, social, or political environment, the importance of local characteristics, and the tendency of the ancient Greeks themselves to generalize whenever they could, and to identify local phenomena with those known from elsewhere). My purpose here is quite limited: it is to present the evidence for individual cults, analyze it painstakingly, and draw only those con- clusions which can be drawn from it. Others may, I hope, make use of this reassessment of the data in their own attempts to come closer to the discovery of the nature of Greek religion. I do not expect that the conclusions I have reached or the judgements I have made will stand forever or even for a day. The only part of this work for which I might claim any permanent value is the collected testimonia, which should, I hope, prove useful to scholars even after the rest of the book, arguments and all, has become obsolete. And if my approach to the subject commends itself to others, then that too may be of lasting use. xii</page><page sequence="8">CULTS OF BOIOTIA Volume 1: ACHELOOS TO HERA ACHELOOS (OROPOS) Päusanias 1.34.3; 1.34.5. Acheloos appears on the fifth section of the altar at the Amphiareion, together with the Nymphs, Pan and Kephisos: perhaps in relief? 1 Prospective consultants of Amphiaraos offered preliminary sacrifice to all those whose names appeared on the altar.2 See AMPHIARAOS (OROPOS). 1 .

At least it serves to separate the aition from the Achilleion. See POIMANDROS (TANAGRA). We know nothing about the extent or even the existence of a cult of Achilles at Tanagra, only about a place bearing his name. A number of interpretations, some more, others less fanciful, have been put forward to try to explain what Achilles was doing at Tanagra.4 I do not know the answer. I could, I suppose, mention (since no one else seems to have made the point) that the sanctuary of Artemis at Aulis, qv, was in the territory of Tanagra,5 and one may recall the role played by Achilles in the story of Iphigeneia.6 Perhaps there is a connection here, but I would not like to press it. The existence, for example, of a Niobeion in the territory of Orchomenos7 suggests that there may have been several such temene named after figures of epic and legend, of which we know little, and whose religious signifi- cance ought perhaps not to be exaggerated.8 I see no connection between Achilles at Tanagra and Hektor at Thebes,9 whose presence there I attri- bute to other reasons, qv. 1. For a possible location of the Achilleion, see D.W. Roller, AJA 78 (1974) 155 and 156, and note 15 of his article "Tanagran Mythology: A Localized System", Teiresias Supplement 2 (1979) 47. 2.

The similarity was noted by Guillon, RPhil 3.10 (1936) 230 and 232 f., who seems to have believed that the Lebadeian rite as described by Pausanias was genuinely old (p. 233). This is impossible to prove. The evidence is after all of late date, and the rite which Pausanias describes need not have been any older than the date of the most recent reorganization of the rituals at the oracle of Trophonios. Maybaum, Der Zeuskult in Boeotien (Doberan 1901) 14-15, regarded the ßodpoq as the original centre of cult activity in the sanctuary. As for the stele, he did not think that this was a votive stele, but suggested that it might have been a cult symbol in the form of a pillar. 3</page><page sequence="11">AKRAIA (KORONEIA) AKRA IA (KORONEIA) ADelt 2 (1916) 21 8.

I can see no reason to suppose that Philon is Opheilimos' younger brother. Philon - and perhaps also the Nikippos of line 37 - could have been his son.4 2. The text does not require us to assume that Soura's servitude to Philon begins at Opheilimos' death: it may have begun at the same time as her paramona with Opheilimos. 3. e X X e ti ãv xa ye v e l x n . I find it difficult to accept Pappadakis' interpretation of this as a euphemistic reference to Philon's death as I can find no parallel to the clause using ti a v . It also leaves Fexuojv Fl x ax u x ř) evos hanging in mid-air. I suggest that it may be a legalistic stipulation meaning something like "she is also to continue in the service of Philon until a total of twenty-one years has elapsed".5 The twenty-one years could begin either with the paramona with Opheilimos or that with Philon, if they were consecutive and not concurrent. 4. If my suggested interpretation of lines 32-34 is right, then the meaning of lines 34-38 is clear: after the end of the paramona , Soura is to attend Philon and Nikippos as a slave does her master 6 at all the sacrifices and at the Akraia respectively. The sacrifices are not stipulated, and may refer to civic rites in general. 5. epuexu) ôè [x]ņ [x]àv &lt;xàv&gt; óôòv xàv Boua)[x]uav. Unfortunately the text is not sound here, and the postulation of a dittography in such circumstances is bound to be slightly suspect. However, as I have not seen the stone myself, I must rely on Pappadakis' reading.7 The use of e p ti e lv = ìevaL is found in various dialects.8 As for the "Boiotian Road", one might note, in addition to Pappadakis' suggestion, that Koroneia was the site of the Itoneion - see ATHENA (KORONEIA): perhaps there was a processional road connected with this sanctuary. 1.

Albrecht, Rechtsprobleme in den Freilassungen der Böotier, Phoker, Dorier, Ost- und Westlokrer (Paderborn 1978) 128 note 136, takes Philon as Opheilimos' son. F. Börner, Untersuchungen über die Religion der Sklaven in Griechenland und Rom 2 (Wiesbaden 1960) 66, takes him as his brother. Both Albrecht (p. 128) and Börner (pp. 58 and 66) take the Nikippos of line 37 as the dead father of Opheilimos. 5. See Aischylos, Eumenides 670.

The syntactical function of xà voyuôôóyevais difficult to ascertain, unless one assumes a certain lapidary telegraphese and takes the term to be used adverbially as equivalent to w axa xà voy u çóyeva .1 if So, one can imagine Soura's being required to participate in processions, in the customary way, at the Akraia and Panamia. 7. The Akraia and Panamia were annual rites. That they were expressly funerary is not certain. In the Thespian inscription, Schwyzer, ZX7i? 491, the manumitted slave is required è it u ax ecpav coe y e v . . . xà yváyaxa év xuç üavayuus xři èv xus 0oúuç nr' èv xuç 'HpaxÀeuuç. Here the presence of the Herakleia in the list suggests strongly that the festivals mentioned may not be primarily funerary, but rather that they provided an occasion for the concurrent performance of funerary rites. The Thyia and Pänamia are festivals - or funerary rites - performed during the months of Thyios (April/May) and Panamos (August/September). Of the two, the only one to which a name might be given is the Panamia: the Basileia at Lebadeia were celebrated during the month of Pänamos,2 but it is not certain that this agon was annual. 3 It is equally, if not more, likely that the Thyia and Pänamia were festivals local to Thespiai, as were the Herakleia - see HERAKLES (THESPIAI). To return to our inscription, we may consider the Koroneian Panamia in the same light as the Panamia at Thespiai, that is, a festival or rite celebrated during the month of Panamos, possibly pan-Boiotian (compare the "Boiotian Road"), possibly local. As for the Akraia, I would compare this with the Thespian Herakleia, as being a festival concurrently with which funerary rites were performed. I do not know the deity or deities in whose honour the Akraia were celebrated. Pappadakis has suggested several. Of these, Zeus Karaios/Keraios is perhaps a possibility - see ZEUS (KORONEIA). On the other hand, the Akraia may have been celebrated quite simply in honour of all or most of the gods of the akropolis.4 As for the date, if the sequence Akraia/Pänamia is anything to go by,5 the Akraia would have been celebrated some time before the month of Panamos. 1 .

It is not certain how old this tradition is,2 but in any case Aktaion is only mentioned as one of a group of Heroes Archegetai of Plataia,3 and it would be stretching the evidence to regard him as an independent recipient of worship. 1. See ARTEMIS (KITHAIRON, PLATAIA) and DIONYSOS (THEBES). The mythological tradition and its significance are dealt with by W. Burkert, Homo Necans (Berlin/New York 1972) 127 ff. See L.R.

Pausanias 9.2.3, describing routes over Mt. Kithairon, refers to a place called 'Aktclíojvoç koltt j, a rock near a spring which was identified as the one where Artemis bathed. On the suggested location of these, see C.N. Edmonson, JHS 84 (1964) 153 ff., and The Topography of Northwest Attica (Thesis University of California at Berkeley 1966) lOOff. 2. H.W. Parke and D.E.W.

This passage has been variously interpreted.3 All that is certain is what Pausanias said he saw: a bronze statue (he calls it aya Aya) attached to a rock with iron (chains, presumably). Given the late date at which Päusanias was writing and the reduced state of Orchomenos at the time,4 it may be conjectured that a bronze statue - or perhaps parts thereof - was discovered by the inhabitants who set it up as best they could and worshipped it - if the report of the annual ritual is trustworthy - as a prodigy. Why it should have been identified with Aktaion I do not know. Perhaps it was the figure of a hunter,5 and perhaps the Orchomenians had in mind the euôo)Àov of Aktaion which Cheiron made to assuage the grief of Aktaion's dogs.6 ALALKOMENEUS (ALALKOMENAI) See ATHENA, HERA (ALALKOMENAI), and HERA (PLATAIA). 1. roOro mi a bròç ÒeÒenévov tò äya'ßa elbov. 2.

At Lysandros 28 (449D) the MSS read' AXea. At De Genio Socratis 5 (578A- B) they read ' AXxynvfl xotu äXeov and àyvocòv tov/ to " AXe ov oax u s ?¡v . K. Ziegler emended 'AXeã to ' AXe'o u on the basis of the passage in the Moralia, 1 and this is now the generally accepted reading; similarly with Deubner's emendation of aXe ov to *A'eņ in the latter. All editors accept the reading tov . It is, on the other hand, not impossible that the Lysandros MSS retain the correct reading and that 'AXea (however it should be accented) is the genitive singular of *' AXeaç .2 One might then emend the first aXe ov in De Genio Socratis to ' AXea / ' AXeqi and keep to over tov to give to "AXe ( u ) ov (the heroon of Aleas), although this would founder on oot u g rjv , unless oot u g be changed to o tu, for which there is no MSS authority. I think this is insoluble, and perhaps all three occurrences of the name should be obelized. To the best of my knowledge, everybody takes the passage in Lysandros 28 (449D), Kau Tacpov auT ou ôëuxvuou ouv ' AXe ou/' AXeã xaXouvTeç to mean "and they point out his (that is, Rhadamanthys') tomb, calling it (the tomb) of Aleos" (post-Ziegler; "calling it Alea", pre-Ziegler). But another interpretation is possible, taking auTou to mean "there". This might fit better with the rest of the passage, giving a list of topographical features: of, õè Kprļauou a Tiîpaxeç ou itpoaa) Ttepuitecpuxaauv . . . Kaù Tacpov auTou ôeuxvúouauv . . . eaTu ôè xai to t ñs ' AXxynvriS yvnyeüov ¿YY^S. Taking aÚTOÜ in this way and not as a possessive genitive has two results: 1 . Rhadamanthys and Aleas/ Aleos are no longer identical,3 2. there is no evidence that Rhadamanthys was buried at Haliartos. What we would be left with are two sites, perhaps early tombs discovered by later inhabitants and called the graves of Aleas/ Aleos and Alkmene. The latter was said traditionally to have lived with Rhadamanthys in the Islands of the Blest after her death, her body having been replaced in the coffin by a stone.4 Another - perhaps later - tradition locates the cohabitation of Alkmene and Rhadamanthys at Okaleia.5 Perhaps the discovery of the tomb - looted? a woman's6 - gave rise to the identification with Alkmene and the consequent location of Rhadamanthys with her in the Haliartia. 1.

To Pindar, and therefore presumably to the Thebans of his day, the sons of Herakles and Megara were eight in number and were dead warriors.2 I have elsewhere pointed out possible similarities between this cult and other group cults in Boiotia.3 If my interpretation is correct, then it should not be surprising to find the worship of warrior heroes associated at Thebes with that of Herakles, the city's champion. One might even speculate that the story of the sons of Herakles and their death4 arose from an attempt to give to these heroes an identity linked in some way with Herakles.5 The name "Alkaidai" is given by one Menekrates:6 this may have been a literary fiction, devised to distinguish these "sons of Herakles" from the Herakleidai.7 I think it unlikely that the name had any other significance. See HERAKLES (THEBES). 1. On the possible location of the site, see A.D. K eramo poullos,,4Z)e/r 3 (1917) 325 ff. and 126 ff.; F. Schober, /?£5A(1934)sv "Thebai(l)" 1430; N.

Various versions are dealt with by Wilamowitz, Euripides Herakles 1 (Berlin 1 895) 81 ff.; Schol Pindar, Isthmian 4.1 04g, quotes Lysimachos ( FGrH 382F5) and Sokrates of Argos ( FGrH 310F9) for a variant wherein they were treacherously slain (by some strangers, according to Lysimachos; by Augeas, according to Sokrates). This might reflect a pre-Euripidean version, or, perhaps with greater likelihood, an attempt to square the Pindaric version of the sons as warriors with the conventional one of the sons as children. See also Jacoby's comments on Pherekydes, FGrH 3F14. Pherekydes, FGrH 3F84 (Antoninus Liberālis , Metam. 33) may be relevant here: after Alkmene's death, the Herakleidai took her to Thebes: Ģkovv 5è ñaparás 'H Xétcrpaq irvXaç, oditrcp kûc 'HpaxX^ç.

The location of Okaleia- known from the Homeric Catalogue and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo 6 - may well have been unknown in later antiquity, and local or other antiquarians may have been teņipted to identify a group of prehistoric tombs outside Haliartos, but within its territory, with Okaleia.8 1 . FGrH 3F84 (quoted by Antoninus Liberālis, Metam. 33). Jacoby, commenting on this and on Armenidas, FGrH 378F5 (Photios, Suidas sv Mampojv vfļooq), doubts the validity of the attribution to Pherekydes. Armenidas is quoted as writing that Mampwv vrtooç was the old akro polis of Thebes. It is possible, regardless of whether or not Pherekydes is the proper source, that the tradition of the marriage of Alkmene and Rhadamanthys and their cohabitation does go back to the fifth century B.C., and that Alkmene's close connection with Thebes prompted the identification as made by Armenidas. 2.

Here, unfortunately, the text of Plutarch does not help, as there appear to be gaps in two vital places. The two manuscripts at De Genio Socratis 5 (577E) read: eupedri 6 ' o3v [lac. 40/37 1 litt. E, 33 litt. B] aaSyaTO s . The various attempts that have been made to fill this gap proceed from the assumption that this tomb is connected with the story of the stone found in Alkmene's coffin: see ALKMENE (THEBES). Thus we find the following (from the Teubner and Loeb editions): [Aeu^avov yèv oúôèv xou], [ïïàtîv ri Atdos Àeu^avov oúôèv rot)] , [Audos ávxí tou], [ev yèv xÇ yvnyaxt Àudou Àeu^avov oúôe v xo'3 ] , and no doubt there have been others.2 But restorations of this kind would appear to be precluded because, as J. Schwartz points out, Plutarch has just used the term xà Xe u^ava to describe the remains.3 Thus the lacuna may well have contained xà Xe u&lt; Ļava , and possibly a description of the remains and another of the place. Indeed, it should be pointed out that Plutarch himself makes no refer- ence to the stone, which might be thought odd if it had been found in the tomb. The second lacuna is at 5 (577F): [lac. 15 litt. E, 14 litt. B] xoi3 yvnyaxoç [lac. 9 litt. E, 8 litt. B] TiuvaÇ xaXxovç . . . Suggested restorations include, for the first, [eu civ a) ôè], [êy^poadev ôè], [ev ôè xw êôácpeul,4 for the second [exe txo 1 , [exetxo xaul. For the first, one might also suggest, for example, [ïïXnauov ôè]. Among the things we do not know is whether there had been a local tradition that this was the tomb of Alkmene, 5 or whether, on the contrary, the identification was made only after its excavation. That it was - or at least appeared to be - a woman's tomb may be deduced from the discovery of a small bronze &lt;Ļe XX t ov .6 Perhaps the mysterious oracle which sent Lysanoridas off to Haliartos to cover up the tomb was responsible for the identification: could this have been an utterance of the oracle at the Ismenion, a close neighbour of the Herakleion at Thebes? On the whole, it seems necessary to leave the question open. We know very little about the cults and traditions of Haliartos, and unless and until such knowledge is forthcoming it would be unwise to speculate further, 7 although I am prepared to suggest that Rhadamanthys and the Cretan connection are late rather than early. As for the inscribed tablet, it may very well, as has been suggested, have been written in linear B.8 The "message" on it is another matter: see MUSES (THESPIAI). 1. The Teubner apparatus gives a lacuna of 40 letters, the Loeb one of 37-33 letters. 2. A.W.

The third restoration of this group and the second of the following were made by A.W. Persson (see p. 1 3 note 2) 298 note 3. 5. This seems to be generally accepted. 6.

The Herakleidai bear her out for burial,3 but Zeus sends Hermes to steal Alkmene away and take her off to the Isles of the Blest, there to be wedded to Rhadamanthys. Hermes leaves a stone in the coffin in place of the body. The Herakleidai, alarmed at the unexpected weight of the coffin, set it down, open it and find the stone, which they set up in the alsos where the heroon of Alkmene is at Thebes.4 The tale looks like an aition to explain an aniconic cult object under the guise of which Alkmene was worshipped.5 The story was known to Plutarch6 and apparently to Diodoros, who, although he does not mention the stone, does refer to the disappearance of Alkmene (but not her death), and is the only source to state directly that Alkmene was worshipped at Thebes.7 Pausanias also knew of the stone, but says nothing of a cult or of the stone's location.8 One may deduce therefore that the site and cult were no longer known in Pausanias' day. 1. See ALKMENE (HALIARTOS/OKALEIA) p. 1 3 note 1. 2. That is, after the events of Euripides' Herakleidai. Could this tradition have arisen after the composition of this play (on the date, see G. Zuntz, The Political Plays of Euripides [Manchester 1963] 81 -88, who settles on 430 B.C.)? Perhaps Alkmene 's ultimate fate was pre-figured in a lost drama, for example, the Alkmene of Euripides (for this play, see T.B.L. Webster, The Tragedies of Euripides [London 1967] 92-94 and 298, where reference is made to depictions of Alkmene on the pyre/altar on vases: the first in the list depicts Alkmene, Zeus' thunderbolt, Amphitryon and Hermes. All three are illustrated by J. Dörig ,JdI 80 [1965] - following Webster's sequence - 157 fig. 10, 155 fig. 9 and 154 fig. 8). 3.

It is taken to mean that the stone, as well as the ßvruxa of Semeie and the ruins of Lykos' house were all in the same vicinity, that is, in or near the sanctuary of Dionysos Lysios near the Proitidan Gates: see DIONYSOS (THEBES). See, for example, A.D. Keramopoullos, ADelt 3 (1917) 368-369; F. Schober, 5A (1934) sv 'Thebai (1)" 1444-1445; N. Pharaklas, ADelt 22 (1967 [1968]) B' 250.IV.A.5 and 251.F.1; M.

Pausanias simply says that he saw the uvfipa of Semeie, but that there was no ļivr'ļ±a of Alkmene, because people say that she was turned into a stone, and even this is contrary to the Megarian local tradition (see 1.41.1 and K.

The collocation of the sanctuary of Dionysos and the Tacpou/yvnyaTaof Ephialtes and Otos may not be fortuitous. 3 Their mother and sister were among the t po (po u of Dionysos seized by the Thracians in Achaia Phthiotis and taken to Strongyle/Dia/Naxos, a major centre of Dionysiac cult, where Ephialtes and Otos were worshipped as heroes.4 See DIONYSOS (ANTHEDON). Compare another Boiotian cult of Dionysos connected with Naxos, that of Dionysos Lysios at Thebes: see DIONYSOS (THEBES). It is possible that the same or a similar impetus which brought about that connection accounted for this. On the other hand, the tradition at Anthedon might have come thither along the coast from Thessaly. For that matter, the one possibility does not necessarily exclude the other.5 There is no evidence for cult activity at Anthedon. 1. 9.22.5 (the sanctuary and grove of the Kabeiroi, and the temple of Demeter and her daughter). Pausanias cannot have spent much time in Anthedon. His description, though detailed.as far as it goes, is perfunctory. There must have been other monuments worth noting in the town: on Anthedon in the second half of the second century A.D. see, for example, ANTHAS (ANTHEDON) and ZEUS (ANTHEDON). One has the impression that Pausanias came by sea and set off almost at once on landing, taking note of sights en route. 2. On the text here, see Hitzig's apparatus. Hitz g prints rrerrotrj/caat mi * * n á&gt;ôapoç, suggesting for the lacuna, for example, ná^cjç, ò 8è . . . The reasoning is explained in the commentary ad loc (p. 456): Homer does not mention their death at Naxos, but Pindar does {Pythian 4.88-89). Therefore, there ought to have been another poet mentioned following in the Homeric tradition, with Pindar cited as a contrast. This seems reasonable. On the other hand, Pausanias may have mi sre member ed the exact words of Homer (I owe this suggestion to my colleague M.J. Silverthorne), and the text may be left as it stands. 3. I do not think that this point has been made before. 4. The full story is given by Diodoros Siculus 5.50-5 1 (FGrH 501 F5).

In his commentary on Kallippos, FGrH 385F1 , Jacoby suggests that, because of this passage, Otos (and presumably his brother) may have played a greater role in Boiotian legend than is generally realized. 17</page><page sequence="25">[ALO ADAI (THESPI AI) ] [ALO AD AI (THESPIAI)] Inscription BCH 50 (1926)406.21 literature Pausanias 9.29.1-2 There is no sign of a cult.

Such an undertaking would require a book or at least a long monograph, and indeed several books and many articles - of varying quality and levels of penetration - have been devoted to the subject as a whole and to aspects of it.1 I will instead be as brief as I can and concentrate on a number of points which seem to me to be important. First, the nature of the oracle. I have elsewhere^ tried to show that the oracle of Amphiaraos shares certain features with that of Trophonios: the deity in each case is said to have been swallowed up by the earth, divination is preceded in each case by a ritual which is basically similar, the act of divination is performed by the consultant himself, it takes place during the night, and a central feature of both sanctuaries is a sacred spring. In the case of Trophonios, these features are blended with those of another type of oracle found in western and central Boiotia, but when these features are removed, the similarities with Amphiaraos become clear. I have called this the "Underground Oracle" type.3 Second, why was this deity, called Trophonios at Lebadeia, called Amphiaraos in eastern Boiotia? The name and the oracle were connected at least as early as the middle of the sixth century B.C., if Herodotos' account of Kroisos' consultation is to be trusted.4 The only reason I can think of is a political one. Traditionally, for example in Homer, Amphiaraos perished at Thebes in the unsuccessful attack by 1.

Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 22-23. It is noteworthy that at the Amphiareion there is no mention of a prophet. The chief official of the cult is the priest (chosen annually and eponymous, at least in hellenistic and later times), whose duties are outlined in the sacred regulations IG 7.235 (a revision of which exists in fragmentary form: SEG 22.370). The priest was assisted by a neo koros (AE [1923] 36.123; [1925/1926] 9.127 and 10.128;/G 7.235; 3498; SEG 22.370), and was on occasion attended by a spondophoros (AJA 45 [1941] 541 -542; IG 7.412). The agon was, of course, directed by an agonothete. Generally speaking, major undertakings - building works, repairs to fabric and votive offerings - were conducted by the elected officials and/or commissions of the civil authority, i.e. Athens or Oropos, depending on the period. Presumably, there was also a medical staff, but we know nothing about it. Indeed, there is very little that we do know about the day-to-day operation of the Amphiareion. 4. 1 .46; 1.49; 1.52; 1.92. It is possible that the story of Kroisos' dedication to Amphiaraos was invented by Herodotos' Theban hosts. 21</page><page sequence="29">AMPHIARAOS (OROPOS) the Seven.1 It is possible that the people in whose territory the sanctuary lay were opponents of the Thebans, and that, as an act of hostility towards the latter, they named their local oracular hero after the famous Argive seer, also no friend of the Thebans. This might explain how the Odyssey' s version, in which Amphiaraos died, gave way to the later canonical one, where he was not killed, but rather swallowed up by the earth, wherein he lived on as an oracular hero. Such an interpretation would be more credible if it could be shown that the oracle of Amphiaraos was always where it was later, that is, near Oropos, and that this was the sanctuary consulted by Kroisos and Mys. This is the third problem with which I must deal, and the reader will already have guessed my answer to it.2 Herodotos saw Kroisos' gift to Amphiaraos in the Ismenion at Thebes.3 This may mean that the Amphiareion consulted by Kroisos was no longer in existence in the middle of the fifth century B.C.4 But this is not the only possible reason. Another is that the Thebans had sacked the Amphiareion in the course of a war, stripped it of its valuables, but left the sanctuary otherwise intact. Hostility between the owners of the Amphiareion and the Thebans is still evident in 480/479, when Mys consulted Amphiaraos on Mardonios' instructions. I refer to the banning of Thebans from resort to the oracle.5 If this is a valid interpretation of events, then the war or battle in which the sanctuary was sacked would have taken place between Kroisos' and Mys' consultations. One thinks of the border warfare along the northern mountain slopes late in the sixth century B.C. as a possible occasion.6 And if all this supposition is correct, then one need not postulate the existence of a Theban Amphiareion7 in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., which would eventually have been abandoned in favour of the sanctuary at Oropos; one may, instead, regard the latter as the original and only Amphiareion. It is worth pointing out 1 . Odyssey 15.243-247. Pindar has Amphiaraos swallowed up at Thebes by the earth - split open by Zeus' thunder- bolt - while being pursued by Periklymenos ( Nemean 9.24-27; 10.8-9; Olympian 6.1 2-17). At Pythian 8.39-56, we find Amphiaraos prophesying at the time of the siege of the Epigonoi, but whether this is to be taken as a refer- ence to an oracular sanctuary of Amphiaraos is not clear. On the other hand, it is not impossible that there was a place near Thebes identified, under the influence of the epic tradition, as the site of Amphiaraos* disappearance. See also the next note. 2. A selection of conflicting opinions: a) The oracle consulted by Mys was at Oropos: F. DUrrbach .DeOropo et Amphiarai Sacro (Paris 1890) 98; P. Karidas (cited p. 21 note 1) 14; M.P.

Kcrainopoullos, ADelt 3(1917) 261 266, identified a sanctuary site (at the junction of the roads from Thebes and Tacili), which produced sherds Iro in the Mycenaean period to the fifth century B.C., as well as terracotta figurines, as the place described by Pausanias at 9.8.3, and therefore, as the Theban Amphiareion. However, there was no positive identification of the deity worshipped here. As for the monument that Pausanias saw - whether or not it is the same as Ķeramo pou I los' site it may have been a rural, or suburban, sanctuary fallen into disuse, which was identified by Pa usa nias'T heban hosts on the basis of the literary tradition.

But perhaps it was Knopia, the name given by Strabo as the original site of the Amphiareion.2 Such a name, if one considers its possible etymology, would well suit a sanctuary of an underground oracular hero who was, like Trophonios, connected with snakes.3 Another problem which has not received much attention is that of the relation between the purely oracular and iatromantic aspects of the oracle. The earliest known consultations, those of Kroisos and Mys, obviously were strictly oracular, although to be sure the mere absence of evidence for the existence of a healing cult at the Amphiareion is not evidence against its existence. Mys' consultation did involve incubation,4 and there may have been a medical side to the oracle then and even earlier. We simply do not know. On the other hand, the earliest evidence we have for the medical function comes from late in the fifth century B.C. ,5 a period when the Athenians - perhaps as a result of the famous plague - began to take an active interest in the healing cult of Asklepios. It is possible that, finding themselves in possession of an oracular sanctuary which utilised incubation as its means of prophecy, they went one step further and assigned to it a medical as well as a mantic function, using the sanctuary of Epidauros as their model. Throughout the rest of antiquity, although the mantic function of Amphiaraos survives6 the iatromantic predominates.7 Still, the site 1.

Bizard,Z?CV/ 44 [1920] 230-231, the original editor, suggested this; see L. Moretti, MG p. 1 1 , but note with Galavotti, p. 141, that a Boiotian origin does not impose itself).

The evidence for these games comes from the fourth century B.C.,4 a period of about a 1. Inventory lists of dedicatory offerings include models of various parts of the body (IG 7.303; 3498; SEG 16.300; compare the Archinos relief: IG 22.4394). In IG 7.3498 there is a large number of ļlū otol, which might suggest that the Amphiareion specialized in chest complaints, were it not for the fact that one client - Sophainetos - is responsible for dedicating these objects in great quantities (B. Keil, Hermes 25 [1890] 621, interprets paoróq strictly as iforripuov, and it is taken thus in the léxica). Five of the items in IG 7.3498 are accompanied by marginal notes, as follows: 17) káôoç lepòç obu evreXi fc, nvpfļva ve lo ko po ç. . . â'(')oç Kaôoç ïepoç Kareayòjq rà Cora mi al Kopojvfàeç tCjv CjrapÍLov hiroKaTay€[i'a[L] , rà dpavļiara vecjxópoq. . . 19) Kparrìp ov ò kljiioç, ,ßrß€ àiroireirrvoice cjç, veuiKÓpoç' 'áWoç Kparrip , 'ßpir/' rà cbrápia inroireirTCJice, vewKopoç, mi rov evòç páaiç ovK evTeXris. . . 24) (áXAoç ßaoTos) kvßoXiov ëxwf vetjKÓpoç. B. Keil (cited above) 618, interpreted these as meaning that the defective objects were in the possession of the neokoros, i.e. that the verb (^xei) should be supplied in each case. However, this interpretation does not account for line 24 (as Keil, p. 619, was aware). A simpler explanation is that the list as inscribed in IG 7.3498 was a cumulative one, which was based on earlier lists, and that the marginal notes were originally comments by one or more of the neokoroi, elaborating on the state of the items in question. These glosses, when the list was finally transcribed onto stone - or perhaps even at an earlier stage - were then incorporated into the text. The word vet oKÓpoq in each case would then mean "As noted by the neokoros". 2. The Amphiareion's popularity at Athens may be reflected in the plays entitled Amphiaraos : in addition to the Amphiaraos of Aristophanes (see the testimonia) we know of others by Apollodoros of Karystos, Karkinos, Kleophon, Philippides, and Sophokles. The record of known foreign visitors throughout the sanctuary's history is impressive, quite apart from the sheer volume of proxeny decrees. Dedications and proxeny decrees reveal a considerable degree of interest on the part of states and important individuals, which can only be explained by assuming that the Amphiareion was regarded as an important meeting place: (listed in rough chronological order) SEG 24.350 ;/G 7.4250-4251 ; 387; SEG 24.356; IG 7.3498; 297-298; 336; 279; 433; 428; 383; 331 ; 349; 264; 372; 380; 244; 268; 305; 311. That the Boiotian koinon set up many of its proxeny decrees at the Amphiareion may be due at least partly to the fact that the Amphiareion was an international centre, the only real one in Boiotia (compare the Mouseion on Mt Helikon, from which no proxeny decree survives). There must also have been a political motive for the erection of federal proxeny decrees at the Amphiareion, but even this depended ultimately on the sanctuary's fame. 3. V.C. Petrakos (cited above p. 22 note 2) 20-44, gives a good survey of the political vicissitudes of the Oropia. 4. The earliest evidence is an apobatic relief of c. 400 B.C. - SEG 1.131: V.C. Petrakos (cited above p. 22 note 2) 121.17, compare 121.16 - and a reference to an eoprrj in IG 7.235. The inscription IG 7.414 is a victors' list of the ['Awcapdife r]a /ue7a'[a | , as celebrated between 366-338 B.C. (possibly c. 350-340 B.C.), while Oropos was independent (although many oí ¿he victors are Athenians, so relations were obviously friendly). After seven victors in musical events and one aaptarrjç, the rest - and by far the greater part - of the list is of victors in gymnic and hippie events. The festival was reorganized as a pentaeteric (this is not to imply that it may not have been pentaeteric before) gymnic and hippie agon, under the Athenians, during the period of their domination 338-322 B.C. (IG 7.4253- 4254; compare line 40 of AE [1923] 43.124: irpòç [t]ov ara6t'o[u]). 24</page><page sequence="32">AMPHIARAOS (OROPOS) century before the Mithridatic wars,1 and another following the conclusion of the war by Sulla.2 The sanctuary survived until well into the Christian era.3 I cannot close this brief résumé without referring to the fact that Amphiaraos seems to have been the only hero who was legally declared a god for tax purposes.4 From the turn of the century comes IG 22.3140, on which 'A inpvép[e] i a appears within a crown, and SEG 24.355, a dedication to Halia by a [ 'opr¡ ] ynoaq. Although there is no direct evidence for the agon in the third century B.C., some proxeny decrees suggest that it may have been celebrated: SEG 15.265 (c. mid-century) for a comic actor from Kyrene,/G 7.275 (c. mid-century) for a tragic actor from Rhodes (compare 1G 7.309 [late in the century) for a Korinthian kcltū rr¡v réxvnv) and IG 7.298, in which Phormion is granted proedria at the agons. If the inscriptions cited in the last two paragraphs are admitted as evidence, then it must be assumed that the agon underwent a further change late in the fourth or early in the third century B.C., with the introduction of dramatic competitions. The agon is dealt with by A.M. Bergmans, Muzische Wedstrijden in Hellenistsch Beotie (Thesis: Vrije Universiteit Brüssel, Faculteit Letteren en Wijsbegeerte, Sectie Klassieke Filologie, Academiejaar 1977-1978) 95-108. 1. During this period the agon was called Amphiaraia Megala (IG 7.411 ; 412; SEG 11.338) and Amphiaraia (IG 7.48; Didymos, in Schol. Pindar, Olympian 7.154a, compare Schol. Pindar, Olympian 7.154c). Direct references are made to gymnic competitions (IG 7.48; 411 ; SEG 1 1 .338), and from the presence of the theatre we may deduce that there was also a dramatic element (the theatre: V.C. Petrakos [cited above p. 22 note 2] 84-93; dedication of parts of the theatre: IG 7.423; compare IG 7.412 and 373 [proxeny decree for a Delian fiovoimq mi peXCjv -novr'Tr'q)). 2. Authorities are divided as to the date of the reorganization of the agon as Amphiaraia and Romaia: some prefer 73 B.C. (as summarized by R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler,Z?C7/ Supplément 3 [1976] 250 note 950), others a date soon after 85 B.C. (A.J. Gossage,£&amp;4 50 [1975] 1 17-120; P. Roesch, in Teiresias E.76.32). The inscription Petrakos, Guide 40, a victors' list of Ta irpurra 'A ļnpiapāa mi 'PcjMaīļa] , would seem to favour the earlier date: compare IG 7.2727 from Akraiphia, a victors' list tQv tpi€tt)plov Eljttiplcjv tcpCj[tov] hiro tov TroXeßov (presumably the Mithridatic war), whose competitions are similar to those in Petrakos, Guide 40; in the latter, as well, two of the eight competitions published (only the upper half of the inscription is given) are designated as lepóç, i.e. there was no award, presumably because there were no competitors (or at any rate no competitors of a high enough standard). A shortage of competitors would be appropriate for an immediate post-war period. See my comments in CEA 8 (1978) 96 note 39. The problem might be resolved if we assumed that the Amphiaraia and Romaia were reorganized as such soon after 85 B.C., and that after 73 B.C., in gratitude to the Roman Senate, a new final competition was added, EbayyeXva rrjç 'Püjßaccjv ulkî}ç (IG 7.415 and 41 1'AE [1925/1926] 29.142; compare IG 7.41 3, lines 47-49: ràç Qvoiaq aç ' Slpuxirioi owreKovotv deÇj ' Ainpuipac òjuoiox 5è mi aç av uerà rav ra unèo rr¡q v¿Kr¡q mi rffc r¡ye¡jLovúiq tov Örjßov tov 'Pcjfiaitov owreXéaovoip ), Note that, according to the editor, Petrakos, Guide 40 ends with a chariot race, not the evayyeXia.

Amphilochos is present too, being the son of Amphiaraos, although his brother Alkmaion is absent,3 and there are at least two examples of Amphiaraos depicted in the guise of Asklepios.4 The greatest collection of deities at the Amphiareion appears on the monumental altar.

Farnell devoted several pages of his Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality^ to supporting a hypothesis that it was Euripides who was responsible for identifying Amphion and Zethos as Dioskouroi and that the epithet ÀeUMOïïooÀou is also due to him. At the time, Farnell was concerned with destroy- ing the view that Amphion and Zethos were a manifestation of "Indo-European Twin 'Sons of God'",2 a worthy enough cause, so he may be excused for overstating his case. The strongest point in Farnell's favour is the silence of Pindar.3 Farnell notes that Amphion 's name does not occur in Pindar, and Zethos is found only once, as Zeathos in fr. 52k.44, where Thebes is called Zeá^ou ïïo [Alv] . In fact, Pindar pays no attention to any of the characters in the story of Amphion and Zethos - not to Lykos, Nykteus, Epopeus, Antiope, Dirke (save as a source), or Niobe. Whether this is because the story had not been developed at the time,4 or because it was a sordid tale and not such as Pindar would have enjoyed telling, it is not possible to say. Some of the weight is removed from Farnell's argument by two things: first, the very fact that Euripides refers to Amphion and Zethos as XeUKOTKjSXo) not once but three times suggests that his audience was familiar with the term as applied to Amphion and Zethos at Thebes (it is not an argument to claim that this was so only because Euripides in the Antiope had willed it so); and second, Pindar's reference at Pythian 9.83 to Amphitryon as ÀeUHLïïuouau Ka ôyeucov yexoLHTiaaLç áyuuaug might possibly be an argument for the prior existence of an epithet connected with white - or gleaming - horses as applied to Amphion and Zethos.5 The ritual involving the peoples of Thebes and Tithorea6 looks to me like archaizing on the basis of a poetic source. Until there has been more thorough excavation of the site, the question of whether or not there actually was a cult practised there remains open. Amphion and Zethos were important figures in Theban legend: the Kadmeia traditionally contained the house of Kadmos, and since Amphion built the walls of Thebes, what more logical place to site his tomb than near those walls? But so far, there is no evidence that the Ampheion was anything more than a landmark, even in classical times. 1. (Oxford 1921) 212-217. 2. P. 212. 3. P. 216 4.

At it - or near it, at any rate - was another monument known as the tomb of Iolaos. Our contemporary source - Pindar - writes of each tomb separately,1 which suggests that they were separate. At Pythian 9.80-83, he has Iolaos buried by Amphitryon's tomb, and in fr. 169.47-49, Iolaos builds Amphitryon's tomb and - perhaps - later shares it (the papyrus unfortunately gives out here, but the words y u3 ó' en u §ńxa in line 49 suggest another reference to the tradition). In any event, whether there was one monument or two, the tombs were close to each other and were the focal point of an athletic agon at Thebes in the fifth century B.C.2 This agon, one would assume, was the Herakleia, or at least its fifth century B.C. manifestation as funerary games held in commemoration of the dead sons of Herakles and Megara. The location of the tomb(s) of Amphitryon and Iolaos is not given by Pindar, but, if the connection with the fifth century agon is correct, one might not be wrong in suggesting a part of the Herakleion complex south of the Kadmeia.3 These are the only contemporary references to the tomb of Amphitryon at Thebes: Pausanias, it is true, mentions it at 1 .41 .1 , but not in his proper description of Thebes. I assume, therefore, that the monu- ment was not known or even known about in second century A.D. Thebes, and that Pausanias' notice at 1 .41 .1 comes from a literary source. Didymos, in Schol. Pindar, Nemean 4.32, is quoted as stating that the Herakleia were celebrated at the gymnasion of Iolaos Ttapa to tou ' Ay cpuTpuuiVo s y vriya , where there was a cenotaph of Iolaos, the latter having in fact died and been buried in Sardinia. I do not know when the tradition of Iolaos' colonizing expedition to Sardinia became current - see IOLAOS (THEBES and THESPIAI) - but it seems to have become canonical at least by the first century B.C., and Pausanias notes at 9.23.1 that the Thebans of his day conceded priority to Sardinia. There has been a certain amount of confusion about the location of the tomb(s) of Amphitryon and Iolaos, about the site of the Herakleia, and about the very name of the agon. Didymos is as right as most people in distinguishing the athletic facilities called Iolaeia (which are so designated by Pausanias 9.23.1) from the agon Herakleia celebrated there. It is easy to see how the confusion could have arisen in the scholarly mind. There is no hard evidence for an agon called Iolaeia: on the contrary, all the epigraphical evidence is for Herakleia only.4 1. Amphitryon's: Nemean 4.19-22; Iolaos': Olympian 9.98-99. 2. See Schol Pindar, Olympian 9.14 8d. 3. See Pausanias 9.1 1 .7; adjoining the Herakleion were a gymnasion and stadion, each called after the god, i.e. "Herakleion". 4. A typical example of the mistaken interpretation of the data is to be found in HStClPhil 72 (1967 [1968]) 84, where C. Pavese, in commenting on lines 47-49 of Pindar, fr. 169, writes: "Iolaus was held at Thebes to have shared the tomb of Amphitryon, after he had fulfilled his heroic career by slaying Eurystheus, see P. 9.80 ff. Near to the tomb, which is called Amphitryon's at N. 4.20 and Iolaus' at O. 9.98 f., was held the great festival of the Iolaea, and lovers used to take their oath there, see Arist. Frag. 97 Rose. The heroon lay in front of the Proetid gates (see Paus. 9.23) and was a majjor local glory of the Thebans". One wishes that the temptation to lump all testimonia together into one huge mass and give it all equal value without due regard to time and circumstance could be resisted. 30</page><page sequence="38">AMPHITRYON (THEBES) We know from Pausanias that the Iolaeia at Thebes, where there was an heroon of Iolaos, were north and east of the Kadmeia. This must be the same complex as that called by Arrian 1.7.7 to tou ' IoÀaou Teyevos: it is 335 B.C., Alexander arrives at Thebes from Onchestos, encamps at the temenos of Iolaos, and on the next day moves his forces around to the southern approach to the city (Arrian 1 .7.7-9). Battle is subsequently joined in this area along a hollow way xaxà to * HpaxAe u ov (1 .8.3). From this it is clear that in fourth century B.C. Thebes there was a temenos of Iolaos elsewhere than at the Herakleion; I see no reason why it should not have been the same one Pausanias saw. Either this temenos of Iolaos existed in the fifth century B.C., in which case it was the site of the agon and of the tomb(s) of Amphitryon and Iolaos, or else the site of the fifth century B.C. agon was moved to larger quarters (there being more room north of the Kadmeia than south for expansion) in the fourth century B.C., perhaps in the time of Thebes' power and prosperity: these new facilities, in order to dis- tinguish them from the Herakleion and yet maintain the essential connection with the cult, could logically have been called after Iolaos. The hero'on of Iolaos would then have become the focal point of the agon, the original tomb(s) of Amphitryon and Iolaos falling more or less into disuse and eventually disappearing from view and recollection.1 If I favour the second possibility, it is because of the co-existence of athletic facilities called Herakleia south of the Kadmeia, a fact which the second hypothesis explains, while the first does not. As for the House of Amphitryon,2 it is where one would expect it to be on the basis of Pindar, Nemean 1 .33- 72. 3 The ruins which Pausanias was shown (9.1 1.1) could have been anything: his informants knew where the house ought to have been, and found a convenient spot. See ALKMENE (THEBES). There is no point in looking for Mycenaean palaces in this area. At 9.17.3 Pausanias notes the existence of a monument east of the Kadmeia. The text is unfortunately corrupt, and reads ïïàtîcflov ôè ' AycpuTpúoovoç ôuo áyaÀyaTa Àu$uva Àeyouauv 'A^rivaç e u ux ÀT10UV Za)OTripĆ0Ł£. A number of restorations are given in Hitzig's apparatus. Hitzig himself regarded the problem as insoluble, and put two asterisks after 9 Ay (puTpucovoc, . All attempts at resolving the crux proceed on the hypothesis that Pausanias is describing two images dedicated by Amphitryon. But there is another possibility, for example, ïïÀriauov ôè ôúo áyaÀyaTa Auduvd &lt;éaTuv*&gt; Àeyouauv &lt;ôè 9 AycpuTpucovóç t e ečvau xau&gt; ' Aftrivãç éuuxÀriaLV ZcoaTriPuaç. This would give a double monument to, or of, an Athena Zosteria and a male figure, identified for Pausanias as Amphitryon. Interestingly enough, at the Schimatari Museum Lolling copied an inscription which Dittenberger restored as follows (IG 7.548, with a cross-reference to Pausanias 9.17.3): [ Auò ] s [ Matxlaveoç, | 'Ada[v]cÍ£ I Za)[aT£Up] lag. The stone was in a sorry state, and perhaps Dittenberger was being too ambitious in his restoration. But if he was right, then my suggestion that what Päusanias saw was two statues, one of Athena Zosteria, the other of a related god (not of Amphitryon) of battle or success therein, may be worth considering.

Another version, in which Argynnos' lover is Agamemnon, is more popular, and it might go back at least to Aristophanes of Boiotia. I do not know which of the youth's two lovers is the "true" one, if indeed either was.1 The kernel of the story concerns a youth who dies through drowning: it is what I have elsewhere called the motif of the "Dying Boy", and has its best known example in Narkissos of Thespiai.2 The aition is localized in the vicinity of Lake Kopais and the river Kephissos, and it would be a reason- able assumption that the Argyneion was in that general area.3 Note also the proper name Argounion found on an inscription from Kopai.4 What the epithet means - the form Argounis is of course Boiotian - is not clear. The first component seems to mean "bright" or "white" (see Leukon), but the second has so far escaped explanation.5 1. Athenaios gives Likymnios' version as an alternative to the one involving Agamemnon, so we must assume that there were at least two versions current, unless of course somebody between Likymnios and Athenaios' source made a copying mistake. 2.

What I cannot explain is why Agamemnon should be involved or have become involved. This is not the only episode with which Greek chieftains at Aulis were connected: see ACHILLAS (TANAGRA). 3.

The first is represented by Xenophon, who may be regarded as the archetype (of course he had his own source), with Nepos and Polyainos seeming ultimately to depend on him. Here the main elements are: 1 . a ritual banquet at the end of the polemarchs' term of office,4 2. the name of this banquet, that is, Aphrodisia,5 3. the involvement of women, beautiful and of good family.6 The second stream is represented by Plutarch, who clearly does not depend on Xenophon, but on a different source.7 This source, although he does fix the event in the winter-time,8 and therefore at or close to the time of the end of the official Boiotian year,9 does not mention either Aphrodisia or a formal banquet to be celebrated at the end of a term of office. According to this version, there is no reason for the proposed night of debauchery other than Phillidas' suggestion to the polemarchs, as it were out of the blue, that they should have a drinking party with women laid on. This seems a little less plausible than that there should have been an occasion - such as official Aphrodisia - which could be used as a pre- text for the conspirators to gain entry to the polemarcheion.10 Neither source - not Xenophon and not Plutarch's source - is perfectly informed about the occasion. It may seem rather presumptuous for someone writing in the eighth decade of the twentieth century A.D. to say this about people who lived so much closer to the event, and, what is more, had access to more material, perhaps even at first hand. However, it is, I think, a statement that can be defended. Not only does Plutarch not mention Aphrodisia or the connection with the end of the polemarchs' term of office, 1. The passage in Xenophon, Hellenika 5.4.5: TráXai Ke'evóvTu&gt;v ayeiv ràç èrat paç, refers to no more than a drunken request to "bring on the girls". 2. For example, F. Croissant and F.

Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963)143 (although he seems to me to misread the evidence somewhat: "En 379, elles [les Aphrodisies] avaient dégénéré, selon Xénophon, en un joyeux banquet nocturne auquel étaient conviées les plus respectables [ae/xforáraç!] et les plus belles hétaires de Thèbes"). 3.

Xenophon, Hellenika 5.4.6. 39</page><page sequence="47">APHRODITE (THEBES) but even Xenophon, who does, has no idea of what the Aphrodisia were all about. To him, as to Plutarch, they were the occasion for debauchery: the projected presence of the women is not connected with any rite, but is used to illustrate the low moral tone of the polemarchs.1 The reason it can be claimed that neither Xenophon nor Plutarch's source understood what they were writing about is the description, in both streams of the tradition, of the women as aeyvoTotTas 9 yuvaua t&amp;v UTcávôpwv, t&amp;v ev àÇucáyaT u yuvauKcav . There must be some good reason for the emphasis on upper-class married women. The only answer I can think of is that the Aphrodisia celebrated by the polemarchs on the occasion of their departure from office were held to honour that goddess, and that the women who participated were not hetairai or even wayward matrons, but rather the polemarchs' own wives.2 In this wąy, polemarch and wife would represent in human form Ares and Aphrodite, mythical parents of Harmonia, the agreement or social contract symbolizing the institutions of the state. The polemarchs, as their name suggests, would naturally regard Ares as their patron god,3 and perhaps that is how Aphrodite, his Theban consort, came to be their patron goddess. From Hesiod on, Aphrodite is linked with Ares at Thebes as mother of Harmonia.4 I regard this, as should appear from the foregoing, as an allegorical representation of the formation of the community by a fusion of its destructive and generative, or, if it is preferred, its male and female, elements.5 The three xoana of Aphrodite - surnamed Ourania, Pandemos, and Apostrophia - which Päusanias describes, were so old that, so said the Thebans, they had been dedicated by Harmonia and had been made from the prows of Kadmos' ships. Presumably the epithets came from Päusanias' hosts as well, although the final explanatory note reads like a comment by Pausanias himself. The three epithets consort well with the patroness of the Theban college of three polemarchs: Ourania representing religious sanction, Pändemos the common good, Apostrophia the defence of the state. It is tempting to read beyond the bare words of Pausanias and deduce that these three images stood by or in the contemporary polemarcheion or town hall, and that this would have been in or near the agora. And if Pausanias does not mention the building, this is, I believe, because at Thebes his interests are mainly antiquarian.6 This building might be the sanctuary of Aphrodite to which Plutarch refers.7 1.

I;arnell refers to Plutarch, Sulla 1 9 (464E); in the case of Sulla, however, there may have been a personal reason for putting Aphrodite's name on the trophy: lie did, after all, regard her as his patroness, sec Plutarch, Sulla 34 (473D Y'ģ). 6.

But we really do not know enough either about Aphrodite Melainis or about the figures on the coins. About the latter, it should be noted that crescents do not occur on all the coins with the female head, nor does the head occur on all the coins with crescents.1 It is therefore possible that the crescent and the head may be separate, the former being, for example, the town's signature,2 the latter a goddess. Perhaps the lady is a Muse? See MOON GODDESS and MUSES (THESPIAI). There was also a work of art - e lkojv - by Praxiteles, depicting Aphrodite and Phryne, in the sanctuary of Eros: see EROS (THESPIAI). One would expect some cult connection between Eros and Aphrodite at Thespiai, but there is no evidence to hand. The Praxitelean piece does not qualify. A small head of Aphrodite, found at Mavromati, must come either from Thespiai or the Vale of the Muses.3 The relief with a dedication to Aphrodite Euakoos is in the Thebes Museum, but bears two names whose distribution seems to be limited to Thespiai.4 Perhaps this was connected with Eros?5 [APHRODITE (THISBE)] Nonnos, Dionysiaka 13.61-62 A poetic allusion. 1.

It is therefore not surprising to find the Delian grouping of Apollo-Artemis-Leto at Delion, and the Pindaric fragment which takes Apollo from Delos to Delphi via Tanagra lends more support.3 However, we do not know anything about the date or circumstances of the foundation of the cult, or whether it was actually founded from Delos or existed even before Delos took an interest: the aition related by Herodotos deals with an historical event of the fifth century B.C. and has nothing to do with the origins of the cult: see below. Another sanctuary with which Delion might have been connected was that of Apollo Daphnephoros at Eretria.4 There is some evidence for the worship of the Delian triad at Eretria,5 and connections between Eretria and the opposite Boiotian littoral are well established.6 There is also the inscription IG 7.621 , where the theophoric name Daliodoros appears on a black glaze kantharos reputedly found at Tanagra: if it is not a forgery - which is not impossible - then its curious mixture of Boiotian dialect and Euboian script may be still another reason to link the two sanctuaries.7 1.

More attention than it deserves has been paid to the aition - the Datis episode - and not enough to the factual part of the story - the dedication of a cult image by the Thebans. Herodotos has been blamed for saying that Delion belonged to Thebes, when we all know that this was impossible.1 But why should it have been impossible? We know very little about internal politics in Boiotia during the fifth century B.C.,2 and there is no reason why Thebes should not, for a time at least, have exercised control over Delion. I think it is likely that this is what the Thebans told Herodotos, and that indeed the whole story in 6.1 18 is a Theban fiction designed to explain their dedication of a cult image at Delion.3 The very fact that Herodotos is so vague about the location of Delion itself suggests that he was told the tale in Thebes, and that he may very well never have been near the Tanagraia or Oropia.4 What he was actually told, in addition to the aition, was that at about 470 B.C. the Thebans had dedicated a gilt statue of Apollo, which they had obtained from Delos, at Delion, which at that time belonged to Thebes. Although Thebes in 470 B.C. is supposed not to have been in a position to lay claim to any territory outside its normal boundaries, I can see no reason why the Thebans should have invented the story about the dedication of the cult image, some twenty years before5: in fact, it may have been the occasion for the poem to which the Pindaric fragment belongs.6 Thucydides, in his account of the battle of Delion, locates the sanctuary e v xrj Tavorypata (4.76.4), but it is nowhere clear that this is a political, rather than merely a geographical, designation. However, there is no reason why the sanctuary and the surrounding area should not have reverted to Tanagra by 424 B.C. There is, in fact, some evidence that the sanctuary may have been abandoned for a time before the battle: fļiiep yàp rļv ot oà HaTaiteitTcSxeL (4.90.2). And if it had not been abandoned, it certainly does not seem to have had constant attention lavished on it. From Thucydides we learn that the sanctuary in- cluded not only a ruined stoa, but also a temple and a sacred spring, and perhaps that Apollo was worshipped together with other deities at Delion (the óyuxeTas ôauyovaç referred to at 4.97.4: could these have been Artemis and Leto, or perhaps local heroes?). 1 . For example, P. Salmon, REA 58 (1 956) 62 note 1 : "Hérodote (VI, 1 1 8) se trompe lorsqu'il signale Délion comme localité thébaine". I suppose this is one way of dealing with a primary source which fails to fit one's preconceptions. 2. On Boiotia in the fifth century B.C., see L. Moretti, Ricerche sulle Leghe Greche (Rome 1962) 97 ff., and compare the cautionary note in P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 34-36. 3. The story of Datis is a transparent aition, even to the extent of having the statue found on a "Phoinician", that is, Kadmeian/Theban, ship. The matter has been further confuscd by the general acceptance of the attribution of Tanagran coins of the fourth century B.C., depicting the stern of a ship, to the sanctuary at Delion and the Datis story. In the story, the ship is secondary, the statue is important. On the coins, on the other hand, the ship is important and there is no statue. If one operates on the principle that a coin symbol should mean something instantly to the people who use the coins, then the logical explanation of these coins is that they refer to ships or a harbour, and there is indeed a very well known harbour which was in the territory of Tanagra, namely Aulis. The coins with ship's stern could reflect the political policy of Tanagra, to lay claim to Aulis as part of its territory. The coins in question are in li. Babclon, Traité des Monnaies Grecques et Romaines 2.3 (Paris 1914) 301/302. 354-356. Boiotian coins with A-l on the reverse have been attributed to Delion and dated 456-446 B.C. (Babelon 267/268.286-291), but i for c (or rather, Boiotian u) is unlikely. 4. ArjAio/; to (-Yqßaiw to ł&gt; ' ìcotl cni Oakàaa-q XaKnihoK MTavTÙov. The Theban bias of Herodotos' accounts is also to be seen in his story of the oracle of Amphiaraos (see AMPIIIARAOS ļOROPOSļ). His talc of the Gephyraioi appears to have come from two sources, Thebes and Athens. There may, indeed, be a whole tradition of Theban propaganda behind an attempt to lay claim to eastern Boiotia by claiming to have settled it in prehistoric, that is, Kadmeian, times. 5. Or perhaps after the battle of Tanagra? 6. The motivation for getting the statue from Delos and inventing the tradition that Apollo passed by Tanagra en route from Delos to Delphi may also have been political, to try to counteract Athens' use of Delos as the centre of its alliance. 46</page><page sequence="54">APOLLO (DELION) Contemporary evidence is lacking for the fourth century B.C., unless we accept - with Babelon - coins which depict Apollo as belonging to Tanagra and minted ca. 387-374 B.C. Head assigns these to Temnos in Aiolis.1 Another doubtful, although possible, piece of evidence is the Athenian decree of late in the fourth century in honour of Demetrios of Phaleron. On it are listed four victories (three in chariot races) at the Great Panathenaia, the Eleusinia, the Delia, and the Hermaia. The last two have been identified as agons at Delion and Tanagra, but it is not certain that they were and there is a better candidate for the Delia at least.2 The inscription BSA 1 1 (1904/1905) 153-172, from Ayios Demetrios near Inoi Station, records the dedication of some kind of structure to Apollo, perhaps, as R.M. Burrows suggested, a temple.3 This is an isolated testimony. There is a little more evidence for the second century B.C.: livy tells of Roman troops sightseeing in the temple and grove in 192 B.C. The Megarian inscription IG 7.20, being a Tanagran decree in honour of a Megarian, is more helpful in that it contains the phrase ê v x (¡3 á y&amp;v u x Ç a [ ]4 I f Ç Aïïoààojvl x(¡¡) AtiAlíj). Here at last there is definite evidence for an agon at Delion, and it is perhaps to this which Diodoros refers, although he attributes its foundation to the aftermath of the battle in 424 B.C. It is also interesting to note that the agon is conducted by Tanagra, that is, that Delion was then definitely Tanagran, as it remained throughout the rest of antiquity. The agon is also mentioned by Didymos, under the name Delia. Tanagran coins of the first and second centuries A.D. with symbols relating to the worship of Apollo must refer either to Delion or to the urban "branch"-sanctuary of the cult which Pausanias describes, or, for that matter, to both.5 See APOLLO (TANAGRA), ARTEMIS (DELION and TANAGRA), HOMOCHETAI DAIMONES (DELION), LETO (DELION and TANAGRA). 1.

I do not propose to deal with the subject exhaustively, but rather to examine a number of the thornier problems relevant to the cult. 1. There has even been a novel which uses Perdikovrysi as its focal point: R. Peyrefittc, L'Oracle (Paris 1948). 53</page><page sequence="61">APOLLO (PTOION) 1) Origins The history of the sanctuaries at the Ptoion is riddled with gaps, which is normal, given the accidental way in which evidence survives or perishes. Thus, although cult activity at Perdikovrysi is attested from late in the eighth century B.C. on,1 the earliest reference to the deity worshipped there is dated ca. 640- 620 B.C.: it is Apollo, with the epithet Ptoieus.2 This gap, of perhaps two generations,3 may be significant: perhaps it was during this period that Apollo was introduced to Perdikovrysi. This is a tempting supposition, but it cannot be supported on the evidence: there is, for example, another gap after the evidence for ca. 640-620 B.C., not as long as that which pre- ceded it (it may have been about twenty years),4 but long enough to cast some doubt on the significance of the earlier one. We must look elsewhere for an answer to the question of whether the sanctuary at Perdikovrysi was always and originally a sanctuary of Apollo, or whether it was a case of usurpation by Apollo, as, for example, at Telphousa and Delphi. I have written elsewhere of the cult at the Ptoion as one example of a type which seems to be found mostly around the edges of the Kopais,5 and if this analysis is correct, then it must follow that the type is pre- Apolline. 6 The basic elements of the type are a mountain or hill (represented by a god or hero), a spring (a goddess or heroine), and inspired divination through a male prophet who imbibed the waters of the spring. At Perdikovrysi there is beyond doubt a mountain, and a male prophet who gave responses in a state of ecstasy (see below, Part 5). Whether the "grotto" behind the temple served an oracular or purely secular purpose,7 water certainly played an important role at Perdikovrysi: the underground water reservoirs of the sixth century and their successors, which seem to have been built to collect under- ground run-off,8 could have been connected with the operation of the oracle, although a more secular function cannot be ruled out: see below, Part 5. Perhaps, as may have happened with Kassotis at Delphi, the original mantic spring dried up9 and a new source of water had to be found to feed the oracle. That the oracular deity should eventually have become identified with Apollo should come as no surprise: it happened in other places, and in this case the striking similarity (although on a vastly different scale) 1.

Another indirect argument for Apollo's having been grafted on to an existing cult may be seen in the very suddenness with which the sanctuary became famous. One may imagine that as long as the deity was strictly local in his appeal, the sanctuary's attraction was also local, the place being rather out of the way (in contrast to Trophonios, for example). But once associated with a major god of prophecy, it would attract more and wider attention, manifested for us by an array of imposing dedications throughout the sixth century B.C. This, and perhaps even the installation of Apollo at Perdikovrysi, might be a reflection of an era of great prosperity in the region of Akraiphia during the archaic period, the extent of which is only now becoming known (see below, Pärt 3 and p. 57 note 4). 2) The Epithet Until about the middle of the fifth century B.C., the epithet of Apollo at the Ptoion seems to have been exclusively Ptoieus.2 Thereafter, beginning with Herodotos, it appears as Ptoios. Boiotian does have parallels to Ptoieus/Ptoios in ethnika,3 and perhaps the simple solution is the correct one, namely that Ptoieus is just an alternative for Ptoios.4 It is curious, however, that at the same time as Ptoieus is found exclusively at Perdikovrysi, at the sanctuary of the Hero at Kastraki, the only form known to be used is Ptoios.5 This suggests either that there was a "gentlemen's agreement" by the people of Akraiphia not to use Ptoieus for their hero, or that the two forms meant something different, that Ptoios was an adjective derived from the mountain, and Ptoieus possibly a substantive expressing a characteristic or function of the deity. In connection with this, it is to be noted that we know of one other epithet in -eiîç from archaic Akraiphia, Oporeus 1. It should not, however, be assumed that I believe that the usurpation by Apollo was instigated by Delphi. On the contrary, Delphi preferred "not to know" about the Ptoion, which is ignored by the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (on the date, see M.L. West, CQ 25 [19751 165 and J. Ducat, BCH 97 [1973] 63. Ducat also comments here, and in REG 77 [1964] 288-290, on the poem's attitude towards other Boiotian sanctuaries of Apollo, includ- ing the Ptoion). See below, Part 5, p. 65 note 1 . If there are links with any major sanctuary of Apollo, they are with Delos: both the Ptoion and Tegyra have legends connecting them with the birth of Apollo. The evidence is, to be sure, late, but the birth traditions may be genuine enough. For Tegyra, see APOLLO (TEGYRA), for the Ptoion, see below, Part 4. 2. On inscriptions (in chronological order, as dated by Ducat): KP 89.50a, IG 7.2729, KP 410.258, 417.264, 391.241, IG 7.2732, KP 408.256, 41 3.262, IG 7.2730, 2731, KP 435.321, IG 7.2735. There are also some inscriptions where only the first part of the epithet survives: KP 392.242 (on which see W. Peek, ZPE 13 [1974] 263.1), 355.202, 395.246. See also KP 4 16 for a reference to inscribed sherds, mostly of the fifth century; compare KP 442. 3. Index IV of IG 7 svv Kcj7raíòç and Acßa&amp;eui should suffice. Perhaps another may be added: KP 430.278, a fragment of a bronze sword blade, perhaps from Kastraki, which reads KN1E£, perhaps ['EpxoMle"^* f°r K pxoßeuuoü 4. For substantives in -evç which are ethnika, see J. Perpillou, Les Substantifs grecs en -cúç (Paris 1 973) 334-345, esp. 343 I 389. The only possible hint of the use of the form Ptoios in the archaic period is the theophoric name Ptoiodoros borne by a sixth century Korinthian (Pindar, Ol. 1 3.41). But this could have been derived from Ptoieus as easily as from Ptoios: compare F. Bechtel, Die Historischen Personennamen des Griechischen (Halle 1917) 92 (proper names beginning BaaiXo- derived from ßaoiXcvs). 5. Some examples of Ptoieus at Perdikovrysi were attributed by (ìuillon to the Hero Ptoios, but this was in conformity with his theory that Perdikovrysi originally belonged to the Hero. See below, Part 3. 55</page><page sequence="63">APOLLO (PTOION) (of Zeus).1 To press the argument further would involve me in etymologizing, which I would prefer to avoid, or at most reserve to a footnote.2 3) Relations between Apollo Ptoieus (at Perdikovrysi) and the Hero Ptoios (at Kastraki) P. Guillon developed a theory that the oracular sanctuary at Perdikovrysi was originally a sanctuary of the Akraiphian Hero Ptoios and his kourotrophos, who were subsequently deposed by the Thebans in favour of Apollo and Athena Pronaia, and that the people of Akraiphia defiantly re-established their local deities at Kastraki, in full view of the older sanctuary of Perdikovrysi, but separated from it physically and politically.3 This theory has been attacked by J. Ducat, for reasons which range from weak to convincing: 1) Guillon 's theory is said to depend on the sanctuary at Kastraki's having been established immediately upon the arrival of Apollo at Perdikovrysi. This is not a real argument, because it is not necessary for Kastraki to have been founded immediately: any reasonable length of time afterwards would do just as well. However, Ducat makes much of the fact that there is a gap of some forty years between the earliest datable reference to Apollo at Perdikovrysi and the earliest datable evidence at Kastraki.4 In order to obtain this gap, Ducat has to dismiss as intrusive two fragments of a Late Protokorinthian vase from the round - that is, the older - altar deposit at Kastraki.5 2) There is no evidence for the presence of any deity at Perdikovrysi except for Apollo (and Athena Pronaia), and no tradition that the Hero Ptoios preceded Apollo there. As Ducat himself concedes, this is an argument from silence.6 1. IG 7.2723. 2. The obvious candidate is one chosen by the ancient Greeks themselves, the verb 7rro(i)etk The epithet Ptoieus would then mean something like "he who terrifies" or "drives one out of one's wits", perhaps not a bad name for an oracular deity, whose prophet spoke in riddles (see below, Part 4, for the eytmologizing, and Part 5 for the prophet). It might also be appropriate to note here the anti-social nature of two other mountain names in western Boiotia, Laphystion and Thourion (which is one of my group of related cults: BICS 14 [1967] 6). The great difficulty of connecting Ptoieus/Ptoios/Ptoion with the verb is that the [o] in the latter is short (although an original has been postulated: see H. Frisk, Griechisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch [Heidelberg 1966] sv irroeu), about which P. Chan tra ine, Dictionnaire Etymologique de la Langue Grecque [Paris 1974] sv irroétj had reservations. Conversely, it is possible that the [o] in the epithet was originally short, see Lauffer 1508 on Ptoiodoros). 3. P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 99-115, compare £C// 60 (1936) 427; 77 (1953) 377-386; Le Bouclier d'Héraclès (Aix en Provence 1963) 65, 79 note 97, 81. It is accepted by Lauffer 1542-1544. 4. KP 442; REG 11 (1964) 287 and note 2. 5. KP 442 and note 5 (where Ducat corrects his statement in REG 11 [1964] 287 note 2). Ducat's reliance on Ch. Le Roy's dating of the antefix in the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. is deceptive. Le Roy himself - FD 2. Les Terres Cuites Architecturales (Paris 1967) 37 - bases his date on Ducat's date of 580-570 B.C. for the beginning of activity at Kastraki. 6. KP 441 ; REG 11 (1964) 288. Much of the force of Ducat's argument is directed towards disproving Guillon 's theories, which no doubt to a large extent explains its at times one-sided nature. The conclusion Ducat reaches at KP 441 follows an analysis of the Pindaric fragments 51a- d, especially 51b (from [a] Strabo 9.2.34 [41 3] : all but the last word; and [b] Herodianos 22rA.16-17, quoted by R. Reitzenstein, Geschichte der Griechischen Etymologika [Leipzig 1897] 305: adding the last word): minore tou rpimpuvov rircjt ov KEvdpCjva koltcoxcOc kov[ - kūt€ox€ Herodianos, Kov[pa] Reitzenstein, kov[pok' Sncll. 56</page><page sequence="64">APOLLO (PTOION) 3) Guillon insisted that during the periods when the Akraiphians dedicated tripods to the Hero Ptoios at Kastraki, there were no tripods dedicated at Perdikovrysi, but only kouroi, the distinction being significant. Ducat points out that some tripods were dedicated at Perdikovrysi during the relevant period.1 This part of Guillon's argument therefore collapses. 4) Guillon 's thesis requires that there was a state of hostility between Akraiphia and the possessors of Perdikovrysi, that is, the Thebans. In fact, there is epigraphical evidence that citizens of Akraiphia were not excluded from Perdikovrysi: they appear, as individuals and as a group, on inscriptions of ca. 540-520 B.C., ca. 500 B.C., and ca. 470 B.C.2 There is no evidence for hostility between Akraiphia and Perdikovrysi. Indeed, the very fact that the two sanctuaries co-existed so near to each other might argue against hostility. We may never know what prompted the people of Akraiphia to found a sanctuary in honour of the Hero Ptoios and what seems to have been a goddess, whose identity is not certain. The mere absence of evidence locating the Hero Ptoios at Perdikovrysi does not mean that he was not Apollo's predecessor there. Local feelings die hard: at Lebadeia, for example, the closest Apollo could get to taking over the oracle was to lay claim to parentage of Trophonios. So here, perhaps, the worshippers of the Hero Ptoios, al- though content to give up their oracle and the old sanctuary to Apollo, could not or would not dispense with their old hero, for whom they built a new sanctuary in a prominent location. They may even, for all we know, have sought the sanction of Apollo Ptoieus.3 It may be noted that the archaic period seems to have been a time of great prosperity in the region of Akraiphia,4 and the establishment of a new civic cult P. Guillon, BCH 77 (1953) 377-386, accepting Kov[pa] , saw in this fragment a reference to the installation of Apollo at the Ptoion, accompanied by a female paredros, and translated tòv Tpiwipavov Utlovov KevdßCbva "la retraite qui enferme au creux de trois cimes le sanctuaire du Ptoion". The other fragments under the number 51 deal with Apollo's search for and establishment of sanctuaries (51a), the genealogy of Ptoios (51c: son of Apollo and Zeuxippe, daughter of Athamas), and the prophet Teneros (5 Id). Ducat quite rightly compares this with Paian 7 (fr. 52g) which deals with Teneros, and a fragment of which (52g [f] , not [e] as Ducat has it) clearly refers to the Ptoion. He is not certain about the connection of all these fragments to the Ptoion except for 51b, for which he cites the identifications already made for the restored nov[pa] , namely Zeuxippe, Themisto, Melia, Athena Pronaia, and for a restored koO[poç] he repeats Sne II's suggested Ptoios or Teneros. I am surprised that nobody seems to have thought that the kou[p&lt;k] might refer to Apollo himself (compare Homeric Hymn 4.490, where Apollo is addressed as Aiòç hy'aè icovpe). One might combine this with fragments 51a and 286 (rrju ira pair oßirrjv avrÇ) [sc. Apollini Délo Delphos proficiscenti ] efoai . . . ck Taváypaq rr)ç Boicjriaç: see APOLLO [DELION]), as part of Pindar's own "suite pythique", in which Apollo's Boiotian sanctuaries were given their due by the Theban poet. Fragments 51c and 5 Id could well have found their place in a poem such as this. lě Ducat, KP 442, with references; REG 77 (1964) 287. 2. Ca. 540-520 B.C.: KP 379.232-233 (with 381 note 6), ca. 500 B.C.: KP 355.202, ca. 470 B.C.: KP 41 1.260 (possibly a tripod dedicated by Akraiphia or a group of Akraiphians. The first word, or words, of the inscription is enigmatic: see below, Part 4 p. 60 and notes 1 -2). Conversely, the presence at Kastraki of a dedication by the Boiotoi, that is, a confederacy under Theban domination, also argues against Akraiphian- Theban hostility. The inscription in question, which I do not think has been published, is mentioned twice by Ducat: KP 448 note 5, and REG 11 (1964) 288. 3. Compare Ducat, KP 442 and note 5; REG 11 (1964) 288. 4. As reflected in the vast cemetery nearby (burials ranging from early in the seventh century B.C. to hellcnistic, with the greatest concentration in the sixth century and the first half of the fifth): AAA 1 (1974) 325-328; 10 (1977) 273-286;Z?C7/ 99 (1975) 642-647; 100 (1976) 644; 101 (1977) 584. The prosperity of the region may also be deduced from the extravagant dedications of kouroi and tripods (for a monumental bronze tripod, let alone a series of them, is an expensive gift) at our two sanctuaries. 57</page><page sequence="65">APOLLO (PTOION) while still maintaining an interest and possibly a directing hand in the sanctuary at Perdikovrysi would not have been beyond the means of the people of Akraiphia. Later on all this would change, but in the archaic period Akraiphia could probably have easily afforded the luxury of worshipping both Apollo and his predecessor in separate sanctuaries. 4) The Cult Complex As I have already noted, the oracular cult at the Ptoion seems to belong to a group of Boiotian oracular cults in which the oracular deity (male, representing or residing in a mountain or hill) is connected with a goddess or heroine (representing the mantic water). In most of the cults in the group, Apollo was grafted on to the original complex, in some cases becoming the father of the incumbent, with the goddess as mother: it is a classic pattern of Apolline usurpation.1 At the Ptoion, the Apolline genealogy is given by Pindar2: Ptoios is son of Apollo by Euxippe or Zeuxippe daughter of Athamas. There is another genealogy for Ptoios in which Apollo does not appear at all: here he is the son of Athamas by Themisto: Asios fr. 3 Ki. (Pausanias 9.23.6). Other sources (Herodoros, pseudo-Apollodoros, Nonnos, Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra) give the fuller version of this genealogy: it turns out that Ptoios is one of four sons of Athamas and Themisto, his brothers being Schoineus, Erythr(i)os and Leukon.3 On the face of it, the second genealogy would seem to have priority over the Pindaric version, since it is found in Asios. This would then ultimately be a local version, linking the Hero Ptoios via Athamas to the legendary Minyans traditionally hostile to the Thebans.4 However, the matter is not so simple. Asios is conventionally dated early in the sixth century B.C., a date which would suit neatly Guillon's theory of anti-Theban bias at Akraiphia.5 But C.M. Bowra, on grounds not related to the Ptoion passage, has pro- posed a date rather late in the fifth century B.C. for Asios.6 This would not only give chronological priority to the Pindaric genealogy, but would also make Asios roughly a contemporary of Herodoros. It is interesting to note that the four sons of Athamas and Themisto are connected with the regions north 1. Compare Y.

Neither the Plataians nor the Orchomenians had reason to feel kindly toward the Thebans, so the genealogy might reflect anti-Theban feelings, but late in the fifth century rather than early in the sixth. Then again, the whole tradition might have been con- cocted by someone like Euripides, in his Ino } and could reflect in part political realities late in the fifth century.2 It is therefore distinctly possible that the earliest known version of the genealogy of Ptoios is that re- lated by Pindar, which makes him a son of Apollo and a daughter of Athamas, the eponym of the Atha- mantine Plain. Here we find no indication of hostility between Akraiphia and Thebes, but a perfectly normal genealogy which could well have been accepted by - and indeed, may have been originated by - the people of Akraiphia. Next to Teneros. He is linked genealogically with the Ismenion, and geographically with the plain west of Thebes which bears his name. He is also associated with the Ptoion, but how, it is not clear, although Strabo (9.2.34 [413] : perhaps from Pindar) calls him a prophet of the Ptoian oracle. I have elsewhere tried to explain Teneros' role in the Teneric Plain, at the Ismenion, and at the Ptoion.3 His presence at the Ptoion may be due solely to Pindar, and might reflect the Theban presence at the sanctuary during the fifth century (see below, Part 6 [b] ). There are a number of dedications at Perdikovrysi to Athena Pronaia, but only a few (five at most) have been published.4 These range in date from ca. 500 B.C. to possibly late in the fifth century.5 Three of them are definitely dedications by groups,6 and a fourth may be restored as such.7 Two, includ- ing the last noted, are dedicated by the Boiotoi. This is not very much to go on. It is to be presumed that an area reserved for Athena Pronaia stood before the temple (it is logical to assume from the epithet that there was a temple), but what it was and what it contained remain a mystery. At Thebes a bronze phiale of the sixth century B.C., inscribed with a dedication (private, it would appear) to Athena Pronaia, was discovered at the site identified by Keramopoullos as the Ismenion, and Päusanias records the presence of a statue of Athena Pronaia at the Ismenion, attributed to Skopas.8 1.

It is possible, too, that Athena Pronaia might in some degree have displaced the original female member of the cult complex in each place, although it is to be noted that at the Ismenion at least, Melia - the nymph in question - is never displaced, so perhaps this is not the right answer. The connection of the Boiotian confederacy, which in the archaic period would seem to have had the Itonion as its religious focus, with two of the dedications to Athena at the Ptoion, does not imply that Athena Pronaia at either the Ptoion or the Ismenion was installed by the confederacy. It is equally, if not more, likely that we have here a forerunner of the practice of the hellenistic Koinon in dedicating tripods at major Boiotian sanctuaries. Only, in this case, Athena would be a very suitable recipient. See below, Part 6(c). A fragment of a bronze bowl bears the enigmatic inscription XauauaTOL ' Axpaucpueeç áve^eav.1 Two interpretations have been proposed for ÀauatatTOu: 1) it refers to a group of Akraiphians, official or otherwise; 2) tou is the definite article, and the inscription records a dedication to a goddess, perhaps Athena in warlike guise, under the epithet Laisia. Both proposals and the objections thereto are discussed by Ducat.2 The connection, if any, with the cult complex, is obscure. Perhaps the reason why it has proved so difficult to identify a successor to our imagined female member of the Ptoion cult complex is that the Apolline cult had no more use for her than it had for the Hero Ptoios, and that the only place in which we have the right to look for her is at Kastraki. There, alas, although her position is predominant, she is nameless, so far, at least. Two other genealogical traditions which may have to do with the Ptoion remain to be considered: A statue base signed by Teisikrates of Sikyon (therefore, from late in the fourth or early in the third century B.C.) records, if the restoration by E. Preuner is correct, the dedication of a statue of Leto and the boar.3 This would give earlier currency to a tradition which otherwise appears only in later literary sources: Leto, on the point of giving birth, was surprised by the sudden appearance of a wild boar.4 Part of this story contrives to explain the etymology of Ptoion as from the verb ïïtocuv ; it is also connected with the reputed birth of Apollo and Artemis at Tegyra, at a place there called Delos.5 The precise con- nection between this story - and the tradition of Apollo's birth - with the Ptoion is not clear.6 The statue was, however, a public dedication,7 so the story did have some official status. It may have begun with the etymologizing, which found a convenient explanation in the tradition of the god's birth at nearby Tegyra. 1. KP 41 1.260, about the middle of the fifth century B.C. 2.

The restored letters have not been questioned seriously, except by Wilamowitz himself, who, on p. 24 of the editio princeps , noted that "die Lücke fasst zwei Buchstaben, wenn einer gross war, oder drei kleine".2 This may not be all. The photograph in the editio princeps seems to show that only two strokes remain of the letter preceding the gap, and it is possible that what Wilamowitz restored as a K might - on the basis of letter forms in the papyrus - have been N. However, a photograph is no substitute for the real thing, and since the papyrus seems no longer accessible, one might as well take it as read by Wilamowitz.3 1.

One wonders, just a little. 61</page><page sequence="69">APOLLO (PTOION) This, then, is really the first insoluble problem, namely, what was actually on the papyrus. The other, which has been dealt with by several scholars, is what the word as restored by Wilamowitz, assuming the restoration to be correct, means. Wilamowitz, followed by Croenert, Päge, and most others, took it to be the name of the prophet himself, 'Axpncpeuv, that is, 'Axpaucpnv, a dialect form of ' Axpaucpeúç.1 The oracle would therefore be that of Apollo Ptoios. E. Lobel2 and P. Guillon3 suggested a dialect form of the adjective áxpau(pvns (axpncp&lt;v&gt;euv , that is, áxpottcpvrí qualifying à^eiSôtav) . If we accept the proper name ' Axpncpe Ć '&gt; , then we must also accept that, as Page puts it, Korinna's "history of the Ptoian oracle is unique".4 There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, despite the mis- givings of Lobel and Guillon. We have already seen that there was no fixed legendary genealogy for the Ptoion, and there is no reason why Korinna should be denied the opportunity of inventing one for herself, which linked the oracle with figures of Tanagran cult and myth.5 Indeed, the very fact that she went into such detail over the antecedents of her prophet may indicate that she was inventing a new genealogy.6 It seems to me that where this interpretation is weakest is in the form of the name itself. A dialectal ' Axpncpeuv/'Axpaucpnv for ' Axpaucpeiîç has no known parallels in Boiotian. 7 Time may of course fill up this lacuna, but it remains a serious gap in the argument. 1.

See below for possible connections for some of these figures with western Boiotia. 6. Korinna may even have been building on an existing tradition. Fr. (f) of Pindar, Paian 7 (fr. 52g) may mention Poseidon in connection with the Ptoion. See below, p. 64 note 1. I say nothing about the date of Korinna, on which see, most recently, M.L. West, CQ 20 (1970) 277-287, esp. 286 (third century B.C., perhaps the second half), and A. Allen and J. Frei, Class J ni 68 (1972/1973) 26-30 (the traditional, earlier, date). At either time the oracle at the Ptoion would have been a suitable subject for a Boiotian poet (see also REG 1 2 [ 1 899]. 59- 115, perhaps a consultation of the Ptoion by Tanagra). Korinna 's use of the word à^evôiav has been compared to Pausanias' reference (9.23.6) to the Ptoion as a ßCLvrelbv . . . hýevSés (Croenert, RhM us 63 [1908] 173; Allen, ClassJnl. 68 [1972/1973] 26 note 2; and add h'ļt€vbr' in line 6 of the dedication of Aristichos, Guillon, Trépieds 2.109-1 15). However, as Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 150 note 5, pointed out, the epithet hxjjevdfc is one traditionally applied to oracles (Archilochos fr. 298 West = Euripides, fr. 1 1 10N2 [Aristeides 2.51 Dindorf and Schol. ] ; Aischylos, Choephoroe 559; Herodotos 2.174; Euripides, IT 1251-1257; fr. 364N2; Plato, .Rep. 2.383a). Nor are Korinna's mantic tripods an argument either for or against the Ptoion, as they too may be a literary device: see P. Guillon, BCH 82 (1958) 55-56. 7. F.

The ending -171/ is normally Korinthian (C.D. Buck, The Greek Dialects [Chicago and London 1955] 164.253.20 and 131.164.7). At the Ptoion, for what it is worth, there is a dedication to Apollo in the form 'A irekoui (KP 417.264, first half of the sixth century), also a Korinthian form (C.D. Buck 164.253.3 and 46.49.3). See below Part 6(e). 62</page><page sequence="70">APOLLO (PTOION) Taking the word as an adjective opens up the field somewhat. But first the problem of the reading and the form of the word must be met. Both Lobel and Guillon require a correction to the text, either àx [ pn ] cp&lt;v&gt;etv or àx [ pn ] (?&lt;veu&gt;. In the former case, we would have to suppose that the copyist left out the first N, the ending -e u v being a dialect form of the accusative singular, on the analogy of known third declension proper names ending in -r] s as they appear in Boiotian.1 In the latter, we would have to suppose that the copyist put the N in the wrong place, the ending - eu being a normal Boiotian variant for the ~ñ of adjectives ending in - ńs .2 I confess that the coincidence of a lacuna and copyist's error is too much for me.3 There may, however, be a way out, and even a partially attested one at that. The name of the town of Akraiphia appears as ' Axpatcpvtov/ ' Axpaucpua/ ' Axpncota .4 Is it not possible that the adjective axpaucpvns might have appeared in Boiotian as*axpncpe^S? If this is so , then Korinna might well have written axpncpeuv as the accusative singular of the adjective. The list of candidates for the unknown prophet is long, and readers will no doubt be able to add the names of their own favourites to those which follow. In the first place, it should be noted that Korinna may have been referring either to a real oracular sanctuary, or merely to a legendary seer, and that no real oracle was involved: it is, after all, a poem and not a historical document. If it is a real oracle, there are plenty to choose from, beginning with the Ptoion, which need not be dis- missed with * ' Ax p ri (p £ ¿v . 5 Indeed, the use of the adjective *axpricpeus might be regarded as a play on the name of the town. Nor should an oracle in western Boiotia be rejected out of hand. The prophet is son of Orion, who, in a story related by Antoninus Liberālis and attributed to Korinna and Nikandros, is the father of the Koronides, Metioche and Menippe, located at Orchomenos.6 One might think of Trophonios, who, with his brother Agamedes, built the treasury for Hyrieus, our prophet's grandfather7: a tradition related by Cicero makes Trophonios a son of Valens (Ischys) and Koronis or Phoronis.8 This Koronis is of course the mother of Asklepios, whose cult was popular in western Boiotia and to whom Trophonios was likened,9 and I do not push the connection. I am merely listing possible candidates, not trying to make out a case for any one. 1. F. Bechtel, Die Griechischen Dialekte 1 (Berlin 1921) 272 § 72; CD.

Turning south, we find a string of candidates along the length of the course of the Asopos, any one of whom the eponym of the river might have consulted. The first prophet in Korinna's list was Euonymos, a hero whose name appears not only in fr. 654 but also in fr. 660. Rhianos is quoted as identifying one Ev&gt;(dvu[- - as father of Str [ato] nike, wife of Poimandros, the founder of Tanagra.2 According to late sources, Euonymos was the father of Aulis, and son of Kephisos.3 Theophoric names derived from Euonymos are known from Tanagra, Thebes, and Haliartos,4 and there was, in the territory of Thespiai, a place called the Euwvoúy uov • 5 The possibilities therefore include the Tanagraia in general, the coast near Aulis, the Kephisos area, and the headwaters of the Asopos. Near the last-named is Eutresis, where there was reputed to have been a famous oracle of Apollo, and further downstream at Hysiai, another sanctuary of Apollo, where there may have been an oracle. See APOLLO (EUTRESIS) and (HYSIAI). On the coast, north of the Asopos, was Delion, with its sanctuary of Apollo, but we know nothing about an oracle there. See APOLLO (DELION). An interesting possibility is Amphiaraos.6 In fact, the term ax pa u &lt;pvè s uôu)p is applied to the Amphiareion in a fragment attributed to the comic poet Aristophanes,7 and Korinna, in calling her prophet ti [ e ] paye u s (line 47) may have been playing on the name of the hero. At least one legendary prophet is known in eastern Boiotia, namely Glaukos of Anthedon: see GLAUKOS (ANTHEDON). He is a possibility, as is an unnamed prophet - divine or mortal - who prophesied at Aulis (see above, note 3). This completes my list. As I have tried to make clear, it is all uncertain, not only the interpretation but the actual text itself. If I have gone on at such length about this, it is simply to emphasize that the matter is by no means as clear cut as it has previously been presented, and that in fact it defies a satisfactory solution.

Something about it must have induced many people, from Boiotia and abroad,1 to dedicate statues and other costly objects to Apollo Ptoieus. The obvious answer is the oracle, which, combined with the prosperity of the region at the time, would have rendered it a popular place of pilgrimage. It has been suggested that the Ptoion may have been at least in part a healing sanctuary,2 but it is impossible to tell whether or not this is so.3 The water reservoirs which have been associated with this function, or with purificatory rituals prior to consulting the oracle,4 could have served merely to provide a water supply for visitors to the sanctuary5 : both the reservoirs of the sixth century and the "cisterns" of the Hellenistic period were underground chambers designed to catch and store water through natural seepage.6 However, there is not enough evidence to support any single theory. I have suggested above (Pärt 1) that the water collected in the reservoirs might have been connected with the actual functioning of the oracle, but this, like all other suggestions, remains a guess. The existence of a sacred spring with mantic powers, issuing from a "grotto" behind the temple, has been questioned by J. Ducat, who regards the "grotto" as having had a utilitarian rather than ritual purpose.7 But its presence near the temple, and the importance of water in the oracular process at the other sanctuaries belonging to my "Boiotian cult type",8 may mean that there was in fact a sacred mantic spring at the Ptoion, whether or not it was ever or always connected with the grotto behind the temple. 1. The most notorious non-Boiotians were the Athenians Alkmeonides {KP 242.141) and Hipparchos {KP 251.142), see Ducat, KP 444-446. The earliest known theophoric name derived from Ptoieus/Ptoios (see above, p. 55 note 4) was that of Ptoiodoros of Korinth, who lived late in the sixth century (Pindar, Ol. 1 3.41). For another possible dedication from abroad, see KP 41 3.262. There may have been other non-Boiotians, but it is difficult to disagree with J. Ducat's tentative conclusion {KP 446) that on the whole the Ptoion's popularity was limited to Boiotia. The Ptoion's neglect by the Homeric Hymn to Apollo adds nothing either way: the poet is not consistent in his description of Boiotia; he mentions Onchestos and Telphousa, but not the Itonion or the oracle of Trophonios, both of which were on the god's direct route. He may have left out the Ptoion simply in order to emphasize Delphi's chronological priority (Thebes, we recall, was not yet built when Apollo passed its site: this I take to mean only that the poet wished to place the foundation of the Delphic oracle in "prehistoric" times, that is, even before the foundation of Thebes, which, as everybody knew, had taken place ages ago). For a different view of the poem, see P. Guillon, Le Bouclier d'Héraclès (Aix en Provence 1963). See above, p. 55 note 1. Somewhat more interesting is the Ptoion's neglect by Kroisos, who is said to have consulted the oracles of Amphiaraos, Trophonios, Abai, and Dodona (Herodotos 1.46). It is, I suppose, possible that some or all of the non-Delphic consultations were later fabrications. But Kroisos or his agents may simply never have heard of the Ptoion. 2. P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 141-143, see 2.104 note 2 and 171. 3. The votive inscriptions give few if any hints of resort to the Ptoion for cures. W. Peek, APE 13 (1974) 263.1 restored KP 392.242 as a thank offering, reading, as the last word, xl àpiv , but this could refer to any kind of satisfactory response. LG 7.4160 (third century B.C.) records the dedication to Apollo of the statue of a girl by her parents. This might have been in response to a cure, I suppose. 4. P.

Our major source is the notorious consultation by Mys,2 when the prophet gave his reply in a language incomprehensible to his Greek interlocutors, but which Mys claimed to have understood. My own view is that given by L. Robert: "Il n'y a pas eu d'oracle rendu en carien; le prophète inspiré a balbutié, il a bafouillé; et le zélé Carien, Carien ßapßapd(pa)vos envoyé par Mardonios a trouvé, dans ce 'langue barbare', ce qu'il cherchait".3 If we assume that the procedure followed on this occasion was the normal one,4 then what happened was that the prophet, inspired by some means or other, gave an oral response directly to the consultant, which the latter transcribed and tried to make sense of. The reported surprise of the Thebans may have been due to later embellishment of the tale,5 or, perhaps, to their not being official consultants, but an ad hoc commission of three men (t&amp;v aax&amp;v aupexous avôpaç Tpeuç ano tou houvou: Herodotos 8.135) sent along to transcribe the response;6 as such, they might not have known very much about the ritual itself.7 The prophet of Apollo Ptoios8 appears on inscriptions from late in the fourth century B.C. to the third century A.D.,9 which disproves Pausanias' statement (9.23.6) that the oracle functioned only until the destruction of Thebes by Alexander. Most of these inscriptions deal with the Ptoia,1® but the prophet 1. Ducat, KP 448. 2. To the works noted by Ducat, KP 446- 441, add Lauffer 1546-1547. 3. L. Robert, Hellenica 8 (Paris 1950) 29-30. 4. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 1 38-1 39 and Ducat, KP 441 regard it as an unusual consultation. I should have thought myself that the only unusual thing about it was that Mys was accompanied by a delegation of Thebans; similarly, when consulting Amphiaraos and Trophonios, instead of going himself - the normal procedure - Mys hired people to do it for him. The Thebans accompanying Mys would have fulfilled a similar function to his paid consultants, that of transcribing for their visitor the response given by the prophetes, which is perhaps why they and not Mys had possession of the tablet (indeed, Herodotos tells us as much in writing that they accompanied Mys cjç hirvypaý oßevovs ra deoiréew ëjxeXXe). Compare L. Robert, Hellenica 8 (Paris 1950) 29 note 3. 5. Herodotos, after all, was told the story by Thebans years after the event. It may never have happened at all, and, even if it did, it could have been distorted in the telling. Herodotos, for his part, plays the straightforward reporter here. 6. AsG. Dau x, Hommages Déonna (Brussels 1957) 162, points out. 7. It is possible that the oracle had lapsed to some extent by this time: the number of dedications falls off considerably towards the end of the sixth century. The method of consultation may simply have no longer been familiar to the Thebans. 8. Whom Herodotos, 8.1 35, also calls promantis; Plutarch, in telling the story of Mys - Aristeides 19 (330C); De Defectu Oraculorum 5 (411F-412F) - calls him prophetes. 9.

IG 7.4155, see P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 181 . Perhaps it was the result of a civic appeal to the god? Compare the Tanagran inscription REG 12(1 899) 53-115, line 4: ßavrevoßevaq rãq iróXuoq. The god appealed to is Apollo, who replies in Boiotian. Could this have been the Ptoian Apollo, as Th. Reinach (p. 82) suggested? 2. IG 7.4160 (a rectangular base): Kephisodoros and Kritis dedicate a statue of their daughter (k ópav) Opheleimis to Apollo Ptoios; Guillon, Trépieds 2.109-115 (a base): Aristichos dedicates a statue of himself to Apollo, who had appeared to him in the night: see P. Guillon, BCH 70 (1946) 216-232; IG 7.4137 records the dedication of a thank offering to Apollo Ptoios in accordance with the will of a man of Larymna. This might have resulted from a private consultation of the oracle. 3. In chronological order, as determined by P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 1 37-1 38: a) an earlier group, all at the Ptoion: IG 7.2724, 2724a, 2724b (312-304 B.C.), 2723 (ca. 285-280 B.C.), b) a later group from the second half of the third century B.C.: IG 7.2724c (Ptoion), 1795 (Thespiai), 3207 (Orchomenos), 1673 and 1672 (Plataia), 2724d (Ptoion), and two others in very fragmentary condition - 2724e (Ptoion) and 1674 (Plataia: see below). For other possible similar dedications see BCH 98 (1974) 219.26; 102 (1978) 565-569; Chiron 6 (1976) 33.30 (but not 47.58). See below, Part 6(c.2). All of the dedications in groups (a) and (b) are dated by the federal archon; he is followed by a list of aphedriates, appointed by member states of the koinon. Their number varies from five to eight: on the college, see P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 135-141. The lists end with a pavTis or ß avrevößevoq, with the following variations: IG 7.2724 (/uávríoç), 2724a ( ßavrevoßevcj , but two men), 2724b and 2723 (ßavrevoßev u&gt;), 2724c (ypaļi(n)aTi8(8)0VT0&lt;;, but no navrevoļievu &gt;), 1795 ( ypafißCLTiÖöovTO ç, [pavrevop] €v[lj), 3207 (y pannare vovtoç, navrevonévcj, 6 i[o]irpoir¿)VTO&lt;; ,[wLp] arevovroq), 1673 ([QtjOTtp] oitÍovtoç, y pappar &amp;8ov[toç] , no paure voļievoj), 1672 (pavrevo¡ uevtj), 2724d (no one follows the aphedriates), 1674 ([ i]apetá88ovToq and one other). One man - Onymastos son of Nikolaos of Thespiai - fills the office in IG 7.2724, 2724a (where he appears to share it with Patron son of Mitis of Orchomenos), 2724b, and 2723, all in different archon years. Another Thespian, a son of [Arjistonoos, appears in IG 7.1795, while a third, Dinias son of Erotion, is pavrevópevoq in IG 7.3207 and QioitponCuv in IG 7.1673. One Homoloichos - for whom no patrony m or ethnic is given - is pavrevópevoq in IG 7.1672, and his name was restored in the last line of IG 7.1674 by M. Holleaux, BCH 13 (1889) 6.X. Dittenberger, conflating Lolling's transcription with that of the original editor - P. Girard, BCH 1 (1877) 209.11 - proposed [y pappar l'Sôovroç] tCj Meveodeveux;. It might have been [pavrevopév co *0]/u[o'uh1xw tw Meveodéveioç (see IG 7.1672, where the second -o- of 'O/uoXwixco was added, in minute form, apparently as a correction). Of the five known pavrevòpevoi, three - Onymastos, the unknown son of Aristonoos, and Dinias - are known to have been Thespians, one - Patron, if he was a pavrevópevoç and not some other official (the stone reads pavrevopevoj, singular: it is impossible to tell where the mistake was made, whether in the number of the participle or in the omission altogether of Patron's office) - is from Orchomenos, and the last could have come from anywhere in Boiotia. I cannot explain the preponderance of Thespians; it may be coincidence or there may be more to it (see G. Busolt/H. Swoboda, Griechische Staatskunde 2 [Munich 1926] 1437 and P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne [Paris 1965] 141 and note 1). We can say for certain, on the basis of IG 7.2724, 2724a, 2724b, and 2723, that the pavrevópevoq served for a fairly long time, perhaps for life, as has been suggested (Busolt/Swoboda, as cited above; P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 [Paris 1943] 75; M. Holleaux, BCH 13 [1889] 22-23). It remains to determine what their functions were. M. Holleaux, BCH 13 (1889) 22, saw in this official a "devin chargé de consulter les oracles à la demande et au nom de la confédération", an interpretation accepted by Busolt/ Swoboda ("der Mantis . . ., der in Namen des Bundes die Orakel befragte") and P. Roesch. I think it may be possible to define the role a little more closely. I see him as fulfilling a function different from that of the npo&lt;çi'Tr'q. The latter, who seems always to have been an Akraiphian (see below, p. 68 note 1), was the god's mouthpiece, not a person who consulted the god, but rather the one who was consulted in the god's name. In this I disagree with P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 159, who took the prophetes to be the city's consultant, the mantis being the koinon's. The mantis, on the other hand, was the delegate of the koinon, who consulted - pavrcverat - the oracle on its behalf. His function was that of deoirpónoq (see Bull, épigr. 55.181), and indeed, we learn as much from comparing IG 7.3207 and 1673, where Dinias son of Erotion of Thespiai is listed as pavrcvopcvio and [dioirp] otxlovtok respectively (on 3207, the two final 67</page><page sequence="75">APOLLO (PTOION) We know nothing about how long the prophet served in office, or how he was appointed; he does, however, seem to have been an Akraiphian.1 To judge from Plutarch, Pausanias, and epigraphical evidence of the first century A.D.,2 the oracle itself seems to have ceased functioning, perhaps after the dissolution of the koinon in the second century B.C.; thereafter, the office of prophet would have been an honorary rather than a functional one. 6) Other Problems There remain many other problems connected with the Ptoion. Those that follow here were chosen in part because of their relative importance, and in part because I have some observations of my own to add to those of my predecessors. а) The Topography of the Sanctuary The evidence, from excavation and references in inscriptions, is most conveniently collected by S. Lauffer.3 More recent excavations are summarized by J. Ducat,4 who also has valuable and salutary comments on the difficulties of reconstituting the physical appearance of the sanctuary.5 The major problems here are: 1) the temple, its date, and possible predecessor(s), 2) the location and nature of the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia, 3) the function of the "grotto" behind (west of) the temple, 4) the nature and purpose of the structures on the "middle terrace", 5) the disposition of the major votive offerings, that is, kouroi and tripods, б) the precise purpose of the hydraulic installations on the "lower terrace", officials, 0i [o] npoiráiVToç and [lap JareiWro«;, are Orchomenians, that is, locals. P. Guillon,/S [1943] 86, sees in this an example of the weakening of federal power, with various cities adding their own local religious authorities to the federal ones, see Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 [Paris 19431 127 and note 3. I am not sure that it is necessary to look for a political motive). The only dedication in which the consultant is referred to as navrioq rather than ßavTevonevoj is IG 7.2724 (it is Onymastos, ßavrevoßev cj in three others), and here the use of ¡lavrevo^évcj for "consultant" is precluded by the earlier clause pavTevoaļ uevoj tCj QcCj hcli air oÔóvtoç ràv 'ayadàv Ļiavreiav Boicjtoîç. It should be recalled that not all the dedications have a ßavrevopevoq: he is missing from IG 7.2724c and 2724d, and possibly from 1674 (but see above, on Homoloichos). The frequency and the occasions of these dedications are impossible to determine. Seven of the surviving ones come from the Ptoion itself, and may have resulted from consultations on political matters {IG 7.2724 suggests as much); the other five may have had a religious impetus: see P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 159. 1. This is clear from his appearance on the victors' lists of the Ptoia, and from the documents relating to the re- organization of the agon late in the second century B.C. (¡G 7.41 38 and 4142). The prophet on the victors' list IG 4147, Nikomachos son of Theomnestos, is beyond doubt an Akraiphian: see CHA 8 (1978) 97 note 39. No ethnic is given for the prophet in IG 7.41 55 (see above, p. 66 note 9 and p. 67 note 1), but since the only other official mentioned is a local one, it is reasonable to assume that the prophet too was Akraiphian. 2.

Ducat, largely in rebuttal of the theory propounded by P. Guillon.2 I wonder, however, if the problem can really be solved, or indeed, if there is a problem at all. It depends entirely on what one makes of Herodotos' statement that in 480/479, and presumably later too, when Herodotos visited Thebes, the oracle was Theban. I have suggested above, in Part 5, that the Thebans who accompanied Mys may have been surprised at the response because they were unfamiliar with the procedure, and that the prophet himself was a local Akraiphian. In this event, the oracle may have remained within the direction of Akraiphia, although formally the sanctuary and the territory of Akraiphia were under Theban control. There would be no need to postulate a hostile annexation by Thebes. The continued presence at Ferdikovrysi of dedications by Akraiphians in the sixth century would seem to contradict the theory of hostility between Akraiphia and Thebes, although I suppose one might get around this problem by suggesting that there was a "pro-Theban" faction in Akraiphia which made it easier for the Thebans to take over. c) The Role of the Ptoion under the Boiotian Confederacies of the Archaic/Classical and Hellenistic Periods 1) The Archaic/Classical Period3 The presence of Boiotoi at the Ptoion is attested by at least one dedication to Athena Pronaia at Perdikovrysi4 and by another - unpublished - at Kastraki.5 J. Ducat has suggested that fragments of weapons found at the Ptoion may have come from a dedication by the Boiotoi to commemorate their victory at Keressos.6 The connection with Athena Pronaia may not have been fortuitous, given that the warlike Athena Itonia was the patron goddess of the Boiotoi: see ATHENA (KORONEIA). There is no indication of a stronger presence at the Ptoion of the Boiotian confederacy at this time. See above, Pärt 4. 1. It would appear so, from the fact that in KP 402.252, one is forbidden to cull laurel. See Ducat, KP 407, and below, Part 6(e). The cypress trees to which the agonothete Aischriondas refers in his apologia - BCH 44 (1920) 249.10 need not have stood within the confines of the sanctuary. They could have been in "sacred land" anywhere within Akraiphian territory. 2. KP 448-450. 3. On the early Boiotian confederacy, sec most recently, J.

The proximity of the Ptoion to the federal capital at Onchestos must have had something to do with the former's use by the koinon. It must not, however, be imagined that the Ptoion was the only Boiotian oracle consulted by the koinon: there is one notable exception, namely IG 7.4136, in which the koinon consulted Trophonios to settle a disagreement between Lebadeia and Akraiphia.5 Nor is it to be assumed that the oracle at the Ptoion functioned only officially, since there is contemporary evidence for its continued use by individuals: see above, Pärt 5 and p. 67 note 2. The koinon gave its backing to the town's re-organization of the Ptoia in the eighth decade of the third century B.C.: see below. On the whole, it would appear that the sanctuary and oracle continued to belong to the town of Akraiphia throughout this period, and that the oracle's use by the koinon did not interfere with this arrangement.6 d) The Ptoia The first that we hear of this agon is on the occasion of what is called a re-organization, dated 228-226 B.C.7 The documents are: 1. See above, Part 5 and p. 67 note 3. 2. See P. Guillon, Les Trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 73-77; 157-165; compare P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 136-141. 3.

Knoepfler, BCH Suppl. 3 (1976) 333 and 340-342. See ZEUS (LEBADEIA). It is, on the face of it, surprising that the koinon did not on this occasion consult the Ptoion as well as Trophonios to settle the matter, but perhaps the very fact that the Ptoion was used as an official oracle dis- qualified it from being consulted on this occasion. Trophonios, on the other hand, although his oracle was close to the sanctuary of Zeus Basileus, was at least not officially linked to the koinon, and so might be regarded as impartial (at least the federal government might have chosen to regard his oracle as such, in order to avoid any possible accusation of favouritism). The dossier seems to be complete, IG 7.4135 being a copy of the amphiktyonic decree relating to the Ptoia, 41 36 the consultation of Trophonios, and 41 37 added later on an unrelated matter. On the other hand, there may have been one or more documents on the stone preceding 41 35. 6.

No doubt there were others which have not survived. To these documents must be added SEG 25.556, which, according to an unpublished reading of the stone by P. Roesch, records an invitation by Akraiphia to Haliartos to sacrifice in the sanctuary of Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios,3 and to send cavalrymen for the team competitions at the Ptoia. The relationship of this document to the re-organization of the Ptoia is unclear. Military team competitions were a feature of the Pämboiotia at this time and later,4 but this is their only appearance in connection with the Ptoia. The latter were, in later times at least, musical, in fact thymelic.5 Perhaps this inscription pre-dates the re -organization. It is also not clear what exactly the re-organization consisted of, if in fact it was a re-organization and not the actual foundation of the agon. The first lines of the amphiktyonic decree have been restored on the basis of SEG 19.379, another amphiktyonic decree concerning the Theban Agrionia, and it has been suggested that the decree accorded safe-passage to technitai intending to participate in the agon.6 But more we do not know, and unfortunately there are no surviving victors' lists which can be associated with this period of the Ptoia.7 Another re-organization occurred late in the second century B.C.8 This dossier is more complete, and consists of: 1) Acceptance decrees by Orchomenos (IG 7.4138), Thisbe ( BCH 44 [1920] 247.9 and IG 7.4139), and several other towns whose names are lost (BCH 44 [1920] 249.9, IG 7.4140, 4141 , 4142, and possibly 4144), 2) Victors' lists: a) followed by a list of delegates from participating Boiotian towns9 and the apologia of the agonothete: BCH 44 (1920) 249.10, and IG 7.4149, b) a list followed by two decrees in honour of the agonothete: IG 7.4147 (and 4148).10 1. cjç hv ai orf¡'aL òpíÇcjoi; see IG 4.4153 ([&amp;a]ot&gt;'oi&gt; to taļ [p]6vtCj 'A7tó'(')cj| [y]o[ç t] w nrcjtwl opt [ [ . ..

Increasing poverty, already hinted at in IG 7.4148, eventually led to a breakdown in the celebration of the Ptoia: IG 7.2712, in honour of Epameinondas son of Epameinondas of Akraiphia, records that the agon Had not been celebrated for thirty years before the benefactor took up the agonothesia at his own expense (the thirty years may be a conventional figure, but it suffices to show that there had been a fairly long break1 ). Later in the first century A.D., increased economic difficulties led the town to call once again on the generosity of its richer citizens to ensure the continued celebration of the Ptoia.2 The agon was still celebrated in the second3 and third4 centuries A.D., and there may have been still another re-organization in the second century,5 since, according to Plutarch, in his day the sanctuary was virtually deserted.6 e) ME+YAAEIO | ENTOE The main document is a stele,7 near the top of which is inscribed y e^vXXe lo | èvxo s .

Both inscriptions are of the fifth century B.C., the first from the first half, the second from the second half. A fragment of a similar stele, reading yeÇu - -, was also discovered.8 The problem lies with the first inscription on the large stele, the injunction against culling laurel and the penalty for so doing being quite straightforward. Two main interpretations have been offered: 1) The stele, or rather stelai, marked a place sacred to or reserved for one Mexyllos, either a hero or a person buried within the sanctuary, 2) yè ÇuÀÀeúo évxds is an injunction against the gathering of wood within the sanctuary, the verb in question being either ÇuÀeuecr^au , auXÀeyeadau, or ^ÇuÀXeyeadau (a verb derived from Ç'5àov and Aeyeuv) . J. Ducat has cogently marshalled the arguments for and against both interpretations, without expressing an opinion one way or another.9 1 . But note the inscription CIL 3 Sappl. 7302, which records a dedication by one Curtius to an Augusta; this may date from the years 14-29 A.D., if the lady in question was Livia, who was honoured as Julia Augusta at Thespiai, where the Mouseia for a time bore her name.

Instead, but with due hesitation, I would. suggest still one more candidate: An Argive inscription of about the middle of the fifth century B.C. (that is, roughly the date of our inscriptions) contains the infinitive ÇuÀÀeadau (for axuÀÀea^au ) in the sense of "plunder".1 Although Boiotian has not yet revealed any example of [ks] for [sk] , connections between the Boiotian and West Greek dialects are not rare.2 There is also the factor of early Boiotian orthography, which is not always and everywhere consistent.3 The letter written +, which is normally taken to represent Ķ [ks] , is also found representing X [k*1] .4 The sound, or cluster of sounds, which it represents in our inscriptions is therefore not entirely certain. The ending, second person singular imperative middle, might be explained in one of two ways, either 1) Ç/axuÀÀe + ao &gt; ÇuÀÀeo &gt; íuÀÀeuo,5 or 2) as a middle equivalent to the active imperative 6 l ôo l ß On this reading, therefore, y è ÇuÀÀe u o is a general injunction against removing anything from the sanctuary,7 with a later particular injunction added against the culling of laurel. ***************** See APOLLO (AKRAIPHIA), ATHENA (PTOION), EMPERORS (PTOION), HERAKLES (PTOION), LETO (PTOION), PTOIOS (PTOION). 1.

The poem is interpreted as being a prayer that Apollo, aided by Eros, will inspire the Theban Sacred Band with Love.2 I am not certain about the connection with the Sacred Band, since it seems unlikely that this unit survived the Battle of Chaironeia of 338 B.C. However, the poet may have had the traditions of the Band in mind. The dedication suggests that there was a sanctuary of Apollo at Schoineus, north of Thebes, that is, more or less between Thebes and the Ptoion. Could this dedication have been made at the Ptoion?

If it had not been for the battle of Tegyra of 375 B.C., posterity might have known nothing about this sanctuary.1 I do not know how much one can rely on the story of the Delian exiles and the Delphic response (most fully related by Plutarch): it was probably known to Kallisthenes and Semos, and there may have been some truth in it.2 We may, I think, assume that the attempt to transfer the god's birth from Delos to Tegyra was supported by a local tradition that the god at Tegyra was young and accompanied by a mother goddess. In fact the two cults are only superficially similar, the Tegyran one belonging to a different, oracular, type altogether.3 I am also not sure how much we can depend on Plutarch's statements that the oracle flourished during the Persian Wars. Perhaps the fact that the prophet's name is given means that there were local records of a kind upon which Plutarch drew.4 However, the story does give at least one important piece of information, namely that the prophet was male, not to mention the presence at the sanctuary of a mountain - or hill - and two springs: see my article, cited above. In summary, there is evidence for the existence of the sanctuary in 375 B.C., and presumably before. The oracle seems not to have been active any more at the time of the battle of Tegyra. It may have ceased to operate during the Persian Wars, as a result of its alleged pro-Greek (or was it really anti-Theban?) bias, although if the story of the Delian exiles is true, it might still have been operating then.

Knoepfler, BCH SuppL 3 (1976) 237 note 860. The two preferred locations are at Pyrgos and Polygyra. Perhaps a third candidate may be added: Stroviki, where Lauffer reported finding the foundations of a rectangular building of the fifth century B.C., with two inscribed sherds, one reading [hue] Qeue: BCH 98 (1974) 644. Plutarch does after all say that the Ptoion was near Tegyra - Pelopidas 16 (286B-C) - which would suit Stroviki better than either of the two other places. See UNSPECIFIED (STROVIKI). 2. See H.W.

Plutarch does give the impression that he is quoting from a local source: not only is the prophet named, but in De Defectu Oraculorum 5 (412B-D), an important role is played by the Chairo neian woman, Koronę, a name which recalls not only Koroneia, but also Koronis, the daughter of Phlegyas and mother of Asklepios, whose cult flourished at both Chaironeia and Orchomenos: see ASKLEPIOS (CHAIRONEIA) and (ORCHOMENOS). 75</page><page sequence="83">APOLLO (TELPHOUSA) APOLLO (TELPHOUSA)1 Epithet2 : Telphousios/ Tilphossios Herodianos, Grammatici Graeci 3.1 (Leipzig 1867) 268.1 1-12 Homeric Hymns 3.244-276; 375-387 Lykophron, Alexandra 362 Pindar, fr. 1 98b Schol Lykophron, Alexandra 562 Strabo 9.2.27 (411). I have written elsewhere on the cult and cult complex.3 Two sites have been proposed for the sanctuary, one at the base of Petra - more particularly at the chapel of Ayios Joannis Prodromos just north of the railway - the other at Ayios Nikolaos near Vrastamitis/Ipsilanti.4 The sanctuary is a very old one, pre -dating the Homeric Hymn to Apollo .5 I interpret the episode described in the Hymn as follows: at the time of its composition there was already at Telphousa a sanctuary of Apollo, consisting of an altar (perhaps a grove) by a spring (inhabited by a goddess who shared the cult: line 381, see 275-276), hard by a crag. This could not be denied: the sanctuary lay on a main east-west thoroughfare and its existence must have been known. The poet's purpose being to insist on and ensure the priority of Delphi over all other Apolline cult centres, he provides an aition for the foundation of the sanctuary which makes it into a dependency of Delphi. In fact, the two cults are of basically different types (see note 3 above). 1. On the variations in the name see F. Schober, RE 6A (1937) sv "Tilphossion" 1044; T.W. Allen, W.R. Halliday, E.E. Sikes, edd., The Homeric Hymns (Oxford 1936) 239. I have used the form Telphousa here in deference to the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. 2. On the variants, see G.

See ARTEMIS (HALIARTIA) and UNSPECIFIED (HALIARTIA). Ayios Nikolaos : proposed by P.

Béquignon, RA (1949) 68 note 6. It was suggested also by J. Fontenrose, TAPA 100 (1969) 119-130 (who seems not to be aware of all the literature on the subject). Guillon's view is criticized by J. Ducat, REG 11 (1964) 288-290, who, in reviewing Le Bouclier d'Héraclès , notes that nothing earlier than the Byzantine period could be found on the site. A similar view is expressed by J.M. Fossey, Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 1 3. I hold no brief for either site. It is possible that ancient remains may some day be discovered at or near Ayios Nikolaos. As for the site at the foot of Petra, its very existence ought at least to lay to rest any argument based on the belief that this region was impassable in antiquity because of flooding. On the other hand, that this particular sanctuary was Apollo's is not certain. The only deity named at the site is Artemis, to whom a dedication was made by Aristokleis and Athanis: AAA 6 (1973) 385, see ARTEMIS (HALIARTIA). The goddess was worshipped in the vicinity - see also ARTEMIS (KORONEIA) - and this sanctuary could have belonged to her, although a dedication to Artemis in a sanctuary of Apollo should surprise no one. However, one still lacks a direct reference to Apollo (sec, for example, the dedication to Artemis at the Kabirion: see ARTEMIS [KABIRION]). Alternatively, this might have been the open-air sanctuary of the Praxidikai: see PRAXIDIKAI (HALIARTOS). 5. On the date of this Hymn see APOLLO (PTOION) p. 55 note 1 . 76</page><page sequence="84">APOLLO (TELPHOUSA) - APOLLO (THEBES) Later sources, including perhaps the poet Pindar, associated the prophet Teiresias with Telphousa. It is after the capture of Thebes by the Epigonoi, and Teiresias comes hither, either with escaping Thebans, or as a prisoner of the victors, being taken to Delphi. He is weary, and drinks from the spring, the water is too cold for him, and he dies. His tomb is pointed out at the spot.1 The only contemporary source to locate a sanctuary of Apollo at the spring is the Homeric Hymn. All other sources seem to connect the spring only with the tomb of Teiresias: even Strabo, the only author who appears to link the three together, is rather vague about the sanctuary.2 I deduce from this that the sanctuary of Apollo fell into disuse at quite an early period - this may be why it cannot be located - and that the memory of it survived only in the spring and the so-called tomb of Teiresias.3 See DEMETER (TELPHOUSA) and POSEIDON (TELPHOUSA) APOLLO (THEBES) A: The Ismenion Epithet: (H)ismenios Rites: Daphnephoria Tripodophoria Excavations and Site A.D.

The reading of the third- and second-last words is established by the Vatican Palimpsest: W. Aly (and F. Sbordone), De Strabonis Codice Rescripto (Vatican City 1956). I have the impression that the reference to the sanctuary was tacked on, perhaps from a commentary on Homer. The single word TeX^ovaux: in Lykophron, Alexandra 562, may also be taken to depend ultimately on the Hymn to Apollo. 3. In BICS 14 (1967) 9, 1 suggested that Trophonios at Lebadeia shared the characteristics of two oracular types, the first being the type described in the article, the second an underground oracle exemplified elsewhere in Boiotia by Amphiaraos: see AMPHIARAOS (OROPOS), and Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 22-23. I should probably have added Teiresias as another example: he was, after all, consulted by Odysseus in the Underworld. 77</page><page sequence="85">APOLLO (THEBES) Literature Anth.

This grouping in in Boiotia is found in the region surrounding the Kopais, at the Ptoion, Tegyra, Thourion, Lebadeia, Telphousa. Teneros' name suggests that the Ismenian group may also have originated in the region near the Kopais, whence it was brought to the outskirts of Thebes. The movement of a cult from one place to another may reflect either a displacement of population or a shift of political power. Since in this case the movement was from a rural area to Thebes, we should expect that it occurred as the result of a growth of Theban power and the spread of Theban influence. We shall see below that the Ismenian cult reflects this in other ways as well. For the moment, we can give, as a terminus ante quern for this cult type, the earliest references to Melia and Teneros at the Ismenion, namely Pindar.2 1 . A combination of different cult types within a major sanctuary is not unusual. A noteworthy example in Boiotia is the sanctuary of Trophonios: see TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA). 2. On the cult type, see my article in BICS 14 (1967) 1-16, and pages 3-5 for the Ismenion in particular. 78</page><page sequence="86">APOLLO (THEBES) b) A male pair,1 represented at the Ismenion by Ismenos and Teneros or Ismenos and Kaanthos/Klaaitos.2 This type is found in all parts of Boiotia, and it is impossible to suggest when it might have come to the Ismenion. Päusanias connects Kaanthos' death with an attempt to set fire to Apollo's temple, which might be connected with traces of destruction by fire at the site of about 700 B.C. The attempted arson is attributed by Hyginus (from Euripides?) to Amphion, upset after the death of his family. On the other hand, one might compare the Theban tradition with a similar attempt by Phlegyas against Apollo's temple at Delphi.3 c) A "dying boy",4 here Kaanthos/Klaaitos. This type is found in the southern and eastern regions of the Kopais, and in central and eastern Boiotia. The boy dies by drowning: in this case, Kaanthos' tomb is by a spring upstream from the Ismenion, and Klaaitos and Ismenos are involved in fratricide (see above note 2). d) A "log procession":5 at the Ismenion, this is represented by the bearing in procession of the h ant (5 /x wit œ (see below, p. 83 note 3, for the accent), a log dressed in a saffron robe and otherwise adorned. The best known example of this type in Boiotia is the Daidala, which occurred on Mount Kithairon, but which has connections with the southern region of Kopais: see HERA (PLAT AIA). The "kopophoria" also has links with the Kopais, not only in the name of the object itself, but also in the aition of the Daphnephoria as transmitted by Proklos: the two warring sides gather their laurel from the river Melas and Helikon, that is, the north-west and southern edges of the Kopais. The Theban procession, which began with the bearing of the log, may therefore have originated in this area. See below, Part 5. In addition to these "types", there are also: e) Athena Pronaia: Pausanias groups her with Hermes as Pronaoi, with statues by Skopas and Pheidias respectively, but Athena's presence at the Ismenion as Pronaia is attested even earlier in an archaic dedication to her. The goddess appears with the same epithet at about the same time at the Ptoion: see APOLLO (PTOION), Part 4. f) The ash oracle, which may have been consulted by Kroisos (see below, Part 4). It was certainly operat- ing in the fifth century B.C.6 This might have been the oldest part of the cult, which attracted to it Apollo as god of oracles, and the other elements. See below, Part 3, and Section B (Apollo Spodios). g) Henioche and Pyrrha, daughters of Kreon, whose images are noted by Pausanias: they may have been an example of a "female pair",7 although a more mundane explanation may be correct: see below, Part 2. h) "Manto's Seat", on which see below, Part 2. 1. For others in Boiotia, see Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 20-21. 2. Kaanthos in Pausanias 9.10.5-6, Klaaitos in POxy 10.1241 col. iv.5-10. W. Pape and G.E. Benseler, Wörterbuch der Griechischen Eigennamen (Braunschweig 1884) sv Káavdoç, translate the name as "Brandner", apparently from K¡ateu&gt;, with obvious reference to the aition in Pausanias 9.10.5. I am not entirely happy with this. It leaves unexplained the final element of the name, and the matter is further confused by the variant Klaaitos (not known to Pape /Benseler, of course). Klaaitos is taken as a mis- reading of Kaanthos, but who is to know? Klaaitos, if it be associated with nXakvu , would be a suitable name for a "dying boy" (see below, note 4). So, for that matter, would the final element of Kaanthos (see Narkissos). 3. The story of Kaanthos" search for Melia is of course identical with that of Kadmos* search for Europa: see F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963) 139 and note 4; J. Fontenrose, Python (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1959) 317-320, esp. 318. For the attack by Phlegyas, see Fontenrose, pp. 24-27. It may be a little misleading to associate traces of destruction by fire with traditions which are agreed that the attempted arson failed: on the other hand, perhaps one ought not to expect strict conformity. 4.

The bearing of the laurel - as distinct from the bearing of the adorned log - is undoubtedly a sign of Delphic influence, which must have made itself felt quite early on. The reticence of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is of course irrelevant to the question of when the cult of Apollo was introduced. The poet was concerned to establish the priority of the Delphic sanctuary, not to write the history of the cult of Apollo in Central Greece.1 Eventually, it may be assumed, Apollo at Thebes came to be identified by the location of his sanctuary near the river Ismenos, and was called Ismenios, but when the god was introduced thither and under whose auspices remains uncertain. To sum up then, we can suppose a development of roughly this kind: 1) an oracle was established, presided over by an unknown deity;2 2) the introduction of Apollo, perhaps under Delphic influence, and perhaps connected with the traces of burning at the site; 3) the attraction to the Ismenion of several cult types and practices originally associated with other parts of Boiotia: this, together with the introduction of Athena Pronaia and the custom of dedicating tripods at the Ismenion (see below, Part 4), may be symptomatic of the growing power of Thebes and her absorption of, or at least control over, weaker towns in central and southern Boiotia. 2) The Sanctuary The fullest description of the Ismenion is given by Pausanias 9.10.2-3: it stood on a hill to the right of the Elektran Gates, beside the river Ismenos, that is, south-east of the Kadmeia. At the entrance were statues of Athena and Hermes Pronaoi, by Skopas and Pheidias respectively. Behind them was the temple, with a cult image in cedar attributed by Pausanias to Kanachos. These statues, it may be suggested, might reflect three periods of heightened activity, late in the sixth century B.C., in the second half of the fifth, and towards the middle of the fourth. Before the entrance of the temple was the so-called Mavì o u s ôucppoç, and to the right of the temple the images identified as Henioche and Pyrrha.3 Päusanias also saw a small number of tripods at the Ismenion. During the Classical period, the most notable feature of the sanctuary was its collection of votive tripods, mentioned by both Pindar and Herodotos. See below, Part 4. Herodotos and Pindar both confirm the existence of a temple: the former notes that Kroisos' gift to Amphiaraos was in his day év 0n3ņau nal Gnßecov èv tõ) vn^ tou ' Iayrivuou ' AïïÔààwvos (1.52); and when Pindar writes of xpuaeajv ...aõuxov tpuïïoôwv Sriaaupóv {Pythian 11.4-5, compare fr. 52g.3), he is no doubt referring to the cella of the temple. L See APOLLO (PTOION) p. 55 note 1 and p. 65 note 1 , and APOLLO (TELPHOUSA). 2. Is it possible that the original deity was a goddess, later known as Melia? Pindar repeatedly describes the Ismenion as her special abode. See below, p. 85 note 3. 3. I prefer to take both Manto 's Seat and the images of Henioche and Pyrrha as works of art (a stone seat from the theatre, statues or reliefs?) which were brought to the Ismenion from the region of the lower town, which was uninhabited in Pausanias' day. 80</page><page sequence="88">APOLLO (THEBES) A.D. Keramopoullos excavated a site on a low hill south-east of the Kadmeia, near but not adjoining the Ismenos, which he identified with the Ismenion (see "Excavations and Site"). Although no direct evidence was found in the course of the excavations, the two inscriptions ADelt 3 (1917) 35.1 (to Apol(l)o Hismenios) and 36.2 (to Athena Pronaia) apparently came from the vicinity of this hill, and Keramopoullos' identification has been generally accepted. What he discovered (the recent excavation was conducted beneath the foundations of this structure and elsewhere on the hill) was the western end of a doric building, which he identified as a temple of Apollo Ismenios. Below it and nearby were traces of earlier buildings. Keramopoullos reconstructed the following sequence: 1) a Geometric temple destroyed by fire ca. 700 B.C.; 2) a second temple built sometime during the seventh century B.C.; 3) a third temple, that to which the surviving foundations belong, begun possibly in the first half of the fourth century, but not finished.1 The first of these temples would be the one destroyed by fire in the Kaanthos/Amphion stories (but note that these attempts at arson failed), the second would be the one Herodotos and Pindar knew, and the third would have been begun during the period of Theban hegemony, and left unfinished when Thebes lost her power: this would be the temple Pausanias saw. Obviously more thorough exploration is needed, in the area between Keramopoullos' "Ismenion" and the river, and including the cemetery of Agios Loukas. It is clear from both the descriptions in the literary sources and the inscriptions found nearby that the Ismenion is to be situated in this vicinity, and indeed Keramopoullos may have uncovered part of the actual temple. However, it is possible that the sanctuary was more extensive (the example of the Kabirion and the excavations there should serve as a salutary warning): see below, Section B (Apollo Spodios). 3) The Oracle Contemporary evidence for the oracle is provided by Herodo tos and Pindar, and possibly also by Sophokles, although he may have derived his knowledge of it from Herodotos.2 According to Herodotos, one could obtain an oracular response at the Ismenion in the same way as at Olympia, that is, by reading omens in the behaviour of the burning sacrifice.3 A procedure of this kind is described by Teiresias in Sophokles, Antigone 1005-101 1 , where, although there is no direct reference to the Ismenion, there 1. Mycenaean remains found in the area were apparently not connected with the later structures: see P.

Sophokles, OT 21) as well as Sophokles. This may not have been the only means of divination at the Ismenion: ëari, used here by Herodotos, may be taken as the equivalent of escort "it is possible", "one can"; it is, in fact, so taken by J.E. Powell, A Lexicon to Herodotus (Cambridge 1938) 101. This would leave room for divination by other means. On divination at Olympia, see H.W. Parke, The Oracles of Zeus (Oxford 1967) 183-184. 81</page><page sequence="89">APOLLO (THEBES) can be little doubt that the poet was influenced by what he knew of the ritual there; there may also be a reference to it in Pindar, fr. 52g. In Sophokles, A ntigone 999-100, Teiresias also divines by the flight of birds, but the connection with the Ismenion is less certain.1 Plutarch quotes a verse response as having been given during the Peloponnesian War, and, as one would expect, the Ismenion is among the oracles traditionally consulted by Epameinondas before Leuktra, and a source of omens before the arrival of Alexander in 335 B.C.2 From the absence of later contemporary evidence, it would appear that the oracle at the Ismenion did not function after 335 B.C., if indeed it operated as long as that. The fact of the matter is that we know precious little about it at any time.3 4) The Tripods As at the sanctuary of the Hero Ptoios and that of Apollo Ptoios, so at the Ismenion, it was customary to dedicate tripods to the god. Indeed, thanks to Herodotos and Pindar, the Ismenion is, one might almost say, best known for its tripods. The most notorious of these are those described by Herodo tos, one in gold said to have been dedicated by Kroisos (1 .92: there is no other indication that Kroisos might have consulted the Ismenion), and three others bearing Kaôynua ypayyaxa (5.59-61). These were, Herodotos tells us, for the most part similar to Ionic letters, from which, and from the texts which he quotes, we may deduce that they were inscribed in Greek and were recognizable as such even to a non-Boiotian.4 They may have been real dedications of the archaic or early classical period.5 Ammonios quotes Didymos as evidence for the dedication of a golden tripod at the Ismenion by people called Thebageneis, whom Ephoros (quoted in turn by Didymos in the same passage) identifies as people who formerly lived independently in southern Boiotia and opposite Euboia, and were later absorbed by the Thebans.6 1. This passage may have been one of the sources for the supposed divination hnò kKtiSóv ljv at the ash altar of Apollo Spodios: see Section B. Similarly, Pindar's description of the Ismemon as h XaQea pavTi'ujv QCjkov {Pythian 11.6), and Sophokles' reference to the ixa'a iòv eãnov òpvtôooKtmov of Teiresias {Antigone 999) may have prompted Theban antiquarians to give the name of Manto's Seat to the object identified as such to Pausanias. See above, p. 80 note 3. 2.

Compare Kallisthenes, FGrH 124F11 (Stephanos Byzantios sv T eyvpa). 3. I wonder if Pausanias statement at 9.23.6 that the oracle at the Ptoion ceased functioning after the destruction of Thebes by Alexander ought not rightly to be referred to the Ismenion? The oracle at the Ptoion did function after that date: see APOLLO (PTOION) Part 5. 4. See F.M. Ahl, AJPhil 88 (1967) 188-194, esp. 190 note 8;G.P. Carratelli, La Parola Del Passato 166 (1976) 5-16.

The incident recorded in pse udo -Aristotle, Mirabilia 133 (843b), in which the Ainianes deciphered an old inscription with the aid of the dedications at the Ismenion, may depend ultimately on Herodotos. 5. The language of the dedications as quoted by Herodotos is in keeping with similar documents of the archaic period; as for their contents, the second at any rate may be a reasonably close transcription: the identification of Skaios with the son of the mythical Hippokoon (not otherwise known) was questioned even by Herodotos. The other two dedications, by Amphitryon and Laodamas, could have been either forgeries, or, more probably, falsified transcriptions. The presumed dedication by Amphitryon was later confused with the Daphnephoria and turned into a dedication by Amphitryon of a tripod for Herakles. See below, Part 5. 6. Ammonios, De Adfinium Vocabulorum Differentia, ed. K. Nickau (Leipzig 1966) 231 (70-71 Valckenauer).

Pindar, Pythian 11.5: Qrißayeveüc; erputoó&amp;pópow k Ke toe. 82</page><page sequence="90">APOLLO THEBES It looks as if we are dealing here with a kind of synoikismos, which is also reflected in HelLOxy. 1 6 (1 1), according to which, early in the fourth century B.C., the Boiotian confederacy met on the Kadmeia at Thebes - that is, it was controlled by Thebes - and the Thebans were entitled to name four Boiotarchs, two for the city proper, and two for previously independent towns, of which the author names Plataia, Skolos, Erythrai, and Skaphai; in the early part of the Peloponnesian War, the towns synoikized with Thebes included Erythrai, Skaphai, Skolos, Aulis, Schoinos, and Potniai ( HelLOxy . 17 [12]). With the addition of Aulis, the list now fits neatly the Thebageneis as defined by Ephoros.1 It is possible that the dedication of tripods to Apollo Ismenios by the people of these towns - the Thebageneis - may have been a regular ritual performed in recognition of the hegemony of Thebes. One or more of three dedications of the sixth and fifth centuries may have been tripods, and if so, they may have been connected with this practice.2 Päusanias noted with some surprise that he saw only a few tripods at the Ismenion. The practice may not have persisted for very long, and there may never have been very many tripods. However, it is more likely that many of the tripods had disappeared by Pausanias' time, especially if they were, even if only in part, made of precious metals. Päusanias and IG 14.1293b associate the dedication of tripods with the Daphnephoria. This might reflect a true tradition, or it might have resulted from an attempt to account for the presence of tripods in the sanctuary after the practice of dedicating them had died out. The tripodophoria to Dodona involved the bringing of a tripod from a Boiotian, or Theban, sanctuary to Dodona. Although the Ismenion is not named, it seems a likely candidate. See TRIPODOPHORIA (UNSPECIFIED). 5) The Daphnephoria The sources for the Daphnephoria are Proklos, Päusanias, and possibly Pindar. Proklos gives the fullest account. His description of the procession seems to be straightforward enough, but it has been confused by modern attempts to reconcile it with Pausanias. According to Proklos, the rite consisted of a procession held every eight years, in which the priests brought laurels to two sanctuaries of Apollo. It was led by a naus aycpu^aXng , whose nearest male relative carried a wreathed olive log called x coti go or kwtco) . Following this person was the daphnephoros himself, who Tris ôacpvns écpàïïTeTau . He in turn was followed by a chorus of singing maidens bearing suppliant branches. The procession made its way to the sanctuaries of Apollo Ismenios and Galaxios.3 1, See APOLLO (PTOION), Part 4 and p. 58 notes 3 to 6, p. 59 notes 1 and 2. See also M.

Commentators have been forced to distort ttís ôacpvriS ecpauTGTOiL to mean that the daphnephoros held the laurel in his hand;1 the more normal interpretation of the term is that he was clutching the laurel, the laurel in question being that attached to the adorned log which the daphnephoros was following. Nor does the daphnephoros ôacpvricpopeu in the sense of wearing a crown of laurel: we are in fact told that his crown was of gold. And, although the chorus of maidens carried suppliant branches, we are not told that these were of laurel, although I suppose they might have been. The principal object borne in the procession was the olive log hqjïïcS/xcSïïû), adorned with laurel, flowers, jewellery, and wrapped round in saffron, that is, dressed as a woman.2 I have noted above (Pärt Id) that this kind of procession is found elsewhere in Boiotia, and I would explain its presence in the Daphnephoria as the result of the conflation of two distinct rites, the other being the actual bearing of the laurel. It is clear to me from reading Proklos that he says that the nau g àyçpLdaÀns and the daphnephoros are two separate people.3 There are those who would identify the two,4 thus apparently making it possible to reconcile Proklos with Päusanias, who tells us that in his day the daphnephoros was a Ttauôa olhou T e 6ok Lļjou 9 Hau aùxòv eö yèv euôouc;, eö ôè êx0VTa whom they i e pea êvuaúauov itououauv to Apollo Ismenios (9.10.4).5 Pausanias' daphnephoros, then, seems to be a combination of Proklos' Ttauç àycpudaXrís and daphnephoros, and the temptation is indeed strong to combine the latter pair into one. However, one must keep in mind that Pausanias is writing from hearsay (toó e ye Kau és éyè ext yuvóyevov oZòa ¿v Onßaug). He does not claim actually to have seen the ritual, which, for all we know, either did not exist any longer or had, like, for example, the Daidala, been resuscitated fairly recently on the basis of memory - not always reliable - or literary sources - not always fully understood or completely adhered to. This would pre- suppose that Proklos was using an earlier source, and indeed there is some indication that he was, and that it went back to the fourth century B.C.6 If this supposition is correct, there is no reason to be surprised if a rite was not performed in the second century A.D. m exactly the same manner as it had been in the fourth century B.C. The reverse would in fact be more suspect. The most that can be said is that in the second century A.D. the daphnephoria, if it did exist then, had as its central feature the bearing 1. For example, A. Severyns (cited above, p. 83 note 3) 2.224. The more normal interpretation is accepted by A. Puech, Pindare 4 (Paris 1952) 169 and note 2. 2. The feminine character of the log's wrappings is noted by J.K. Schönberger, Giotta 29 (1942) 88. The astronomical interpretation of the decorations is in all likelihood a later embellishment: see A. Severyns (cited above, p. 83 note 3) 2.219, and M.P. Nilsson, Opera Minora Selecta 3 (Lund 1960) 172. 3. For what it may be worth, the "original" Daphnephoros in the aition, Polematas, is hardly a child, but an adult; however, I do not know if this would mean anything as far as the actual rite is concerned. 4. For example: U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Pindaros (Berlin 1922) 432-438, esp. 433-434; O. Schroeder, Pindarus (Leipzig 1930) 309; L.R. Farnell, The Works of Pindar 2 (London 1932) 427 ff.; F.

Pausanias' next sentence - oreipavovs yap ypvWcjv ôéupvriç 'popovow oí irafòeç - seems to hint at a procession, but it might just as easily be taken as a gloss on Ôa^a^ópoç (the form of the word as given by Pausanias, that is, not koine, but dialect). 6. If we accept itpucparibas (M) in preference to cmKpaTÍÔaç (A: which Severyns prefers), as the name of the footwear worn by the daphnephoros, then the earliest possible date for Proklos' source would have to be the tourth century B.C.

The hymn, Pindar fr. 94d, has been identified as a daphnephoric hymn: the maidens involved seem to bear laurel, and there appears to be a large enough cast of characters to fill the bill. I am not certain about this. The daphnephoric hymn, we are told by Proklos, is a hymn in honour of Apollo; but, in this poem the maiden undertakes to sing in honour of the house of Aioladas and his son Pafcondas, and proceeds to do so. Apollo appears only once in the text, and even then only by grace of restoration.2 There is, in any event, no reference to the Ismenion (or to Melia, which is a little surprising, given Pindar's habit of citing her in connection with the Ismenion3). The dramatis personae are not as easy to identify as some would have us believe.4 The only people whose relationship is clear are Aioladas and Pagondas, father and son. We may assume that Agasikles is a member of the family. The son of Damaina, on the other hand, need not be related to any of these. He, as well as (An)daisistrota and the unnamed singer, may be quite separate from the family of Aioladas, Pagondas, and Agasikles. On balance I find it impossible to decide whether or not this hymn is daphnephoric. It is a Theban hymn, but seems to honour a noble family rather than the Ismenian god. In this respect it has more in common with the epinikia than with what one might expect of a daphnephoric hymn. Pindar is said to have written a daphnephoric hymn for his son Daiphantos, but it has not survived. One other piece of evidence has been proposed for the daphnephoros, namely the tombstone of Rhynchon from Thebes, in which the warrior is depicted wearing a laurel wreath: Keramopoullos inter- preted this as signifying that he had been a daphnephoros.5 To summarize: there appear originally to have been two separate processions, one Apolline, in which the laurel was borne to his sanctuaries, the other non- or pre-Apolline, in which an adorned log (the kootio) is a Ç'ÎÀov, not a branch) was borne. They were linked together by having the daphnephoros hold on to the laurel attached to the log. The Daphnephoria proper suggests, by its name and character, that it was introduced under Delphic influence. The log procession is one manifestation of a pan-Boiotian rite known to have been celebrated in southern Boiotia, but which may also have been celebrated in the Kopais region.6 1. On whom see A. Oepke, ARW 31 (1934) 43-56 and L. Robert , Athenian Studies Presented to W.S. Ferguson: HStClassPhil Supplement 1 (1940) 509-519 = Opera Minora Selecta 1 (Amsterdam 1969) 633-643. L. Robert's study leads me to wonder whether the cult officiant in question actually had to have both his parents alive. If the title was not to be taken literally, this might explain the otherwise confusing term b ¡láXiara abr&lt;¿ otKeíbç, who is taken by Scveryns (cited above, p. 83 note 3) 2.222-223 (in agreement with Puech) to be an older relative who carried the log because it was too heavy for the boy, see J.K. Schönberger, Giotta 29 (1942) 88, der ihm nâ'chtsverwandte &lt;Knabc&gt; If the significance of the boy's title lay with his function rather than his status, then the term "nearest male relative" might well include his father, if he were still alive. 2.

Keramopoullos was uncertain in ADelt 3(1917)41 note 1 , as the result of the discovery in Tanagra of the contemporary stele of Saugenes, also wearing a laurel wreath, but in AE (1 920) 1 1 he concluded that TÚV QrißCov ò aréipavoç rrfc Ôáipvrjq 8èv eîxe rr¡v ih vài; ovo av or)paoiait, ree pí c iīoKvtī pay ļioi&gt;r'oaiie v avt orépoj (that is, concerning Rhynchon).

Nilsson, Opera Minora Selecta 3 (Lund 1 960) 171, took the Daphnephoria to be the older part of the ritual, the log-bearing a later addition; this reversed the opinion he expressed in Griechische Feste (Leipzig 1 906) 1 64-1 65. 85</page><page sequence="93">APOLLO (THEBES) B: Other Cults Epithet: Boedromios Päusanias 9.17.2 In the agora of the lower town, east of the Kadmeia and near the temple of Artemis Eukleia, a statue (?) of Apollo Boedromios. * Epithet: Karykeios Jeffery 94.5; 94.7 The first of these two inscriptions, dated ?ca. 625-600 B.C. by Miss Jeffery, is on a fragment of a lebes bought at Thebes. It reads: Aêyodepêç | Huapòv ' Aïïoàôvoç KapUTíêFLÕ. The name Demotheres was apparently inscribed separately. Its form is not Boiotian, but Euboic. The second inscription, which Miss Jeffery dates ca. 610-550?, is on a bronze phiale bought in Athens and said to have come from Tanagra. It reads: H tapo v tõ KapuxêFuõ QXóFaqoç áuapxovTOç ÀeçTOuç 0eßauous áve^eav.1 Although the Karykeios of the second inscription is not further identified, the identity in form and near- ness in date suggest strongly that he is the same as the Apollo in the first inscription. The attribution of the second inscription to Tanagra, and the presence at that town of a mountain called Kerykeion2 would appear to place this Apollo at Tanagra. Weighed against this, however, is the fact that the dedicators of this object were Thebans, that the other inscription was bought at Thebes (no strong argument, it may be conceded), and that the attribution of Boiotian antiquities to Tanagra must have been a fairly common practice late in the nineteenth century. Furthermore, if one takes the epithet as descriptive rather than topographical, an Apollo called Karykeios would be a suitable recipient for a dedication by a group of soldiers (see above, note 1). On balance, I prefer to regard Apollo Karykeios as a Theban rather than a Tanagran god. ♦ 1 . The datives have caused some consternation. L.H. Jeffery, The Ix)cal Scripts of Archaic Greece (Oxford 1961) 92 note 2, suggests that they were inscribed in error and what was intended was nominative plurals. But a similar instance is found at the Ptoion, where IG 7.2734 may be restored to read [ --ápxoi&gt;Toç 'A/cp] aupuéeooi H époL riroiļot] . M. I'eyel, RKG 56 (1 943) 351 , suggested that the datives should not be removed in either case, that they both depend on the preceding participle grammatically, but are logically the subject of hvèdeav (which he would therefore restore in IG 7.2734). The relevant participle in Jeffery 94.7, hirápxovToq , may be compared with the noun anap'oi ; (see LSfl Suppl. sv ), "commander". The Theban Xeyrot might be compared with the later cttiXcktv of the Boiotian army, whom M. Feyel, Poly be et l'Histoire de Bàotie au Ule Siècle avant notre Ere (Paris 1 942) identifies as "soldats du premier rang" (131 note 3), "recrutés parmi les citoyens de bonne famille" (1 60). 2.

Holleaux,1 whose argument seems to rest on the assumption that the oracle at the Ismenion was still operating in the second century A.D. This in turn depends on our taking the references by Maximus Tyrius as contemporary evidence, which it is difficult to do, given the rhetorical and conventional nature of Maximus' work.2 There is no need to assume that Pausanias was wrong, or did not even see Thebes himself, simply because he locates an ash altar of Apollo, where divination õntò hàtiõÓvujv could be obtained, else- where than within the sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios, where, given the nature of the Ismenian oracle, one would expect to find it. If one assumes that Päusanias was writing in good faith, there are at least two possible explanations for the apparent confusion: 1) The altar was within the original limits of the Ismenion, but these may have been more restricted in the second century A.D. than they had been in Thebes' heyday (Pausanias is in any case rather vague about the topography of this area), or 2) the altar may have originally belonged to Herakles, but was later allocated to Apollo by local antiquarians, who had read their Herodotos and Sophokles (especially the latter), simply because it was an ash altar (It is to be noted that yavTLxii • . • aitò kXtíôovídv is hardly to be equated with a formal oracular shrine. I doubt that there was an oracle of any kind here. One cannot insist too much on the importance of the fact that large parts of Thebes were uninhabited in Pausanias' day and that he was, more than most people realize, at the mercy of his local informants). My own preference is for the second of these two possibilities: see HERAKLES (THEBES). * 1.

Among the associated finds was a bronze spear point dis- covered near, but not in, the temple, This object is inscribed toïïoààovoç H[ u ] epóv in characters which appear to be of about the first half of the fifth century B.C.2 The discovery of this inscription led to the identification, plausible enough, of the temple as one of Apollo. Coins found in the temple range in date from the fifth or fourth to the second centuries B.C.3: the temple was, therefore, in use at the time of BCH 61 (1937) 217.III, which records the rentals of public lands ca. 230 B.C., in the course of which it appears that the lessees were required to leave free a space about the sanctuary of Apollo ?Archegetas.4 There is a chance that the two places were identical. Other evidence of late archaic or early Classical date consists of two fragments of kouroi from the Kastro,5 whose connection with Apollo is, of course, not absolutely certain, and the inscription SEG 22.404, with a dedication to Apollo Platytoxos and reference to xaug xaxôïïuade nópauç (whoever they may be: Muses? Nymphs? even the attribution to Thespiai is uncertain). From the hellenistic period come three other documents, of which two are certain: BCH 50 (1926) 427.51: fragment of a dedication to ?Apollo by a ?former priestess; IG 7.1779: manumission decree sworn before Asklepios and Apollo; SEG 25.555: relief of a bull's head, with the inscription ' AuoXAoívoc (the iota reported between the N and O is in fact a fault in the stone). Could this mean that the Thespian Apollo is the Theos Tauros? See THEOS TAUROS (THESPIAI). A small triangular base records a dedication, in koine, to Apollo by two women or a man and a woman: BCH 50 (1926) 408.23. From late in the first century A.D. come bronze coins depicting Apollo Kitharoidos on the reverse: this could be taken to refer to the cult of the Muses as much as to Apollo. The god also appears at the vale of the Muses: Pausanias records the presence there of a bronze group depicting Apollo fighting Hermes for the lyre,6 and the top of a base has been found with the names of Zeus, Mnemosyne, and Apollo inscribed: BCH 50 (1926) 403.19. It would be surprising if Apollo had been completely absent from the sanctuary on Helikon. In sum, the evidence for Thespiai itself is patchy: the temple was situated in the countryside, and one imagines that there was an urban sanctuary of the god as well; perhaps the manumission decree refers to this? Schol. Aratos 223 suggests that there may have been an oracle at Thespiai.

It is possible that there was at the beginning a cult of a goddess who went by the name of Iphianassa or Iphigeneia or Iphimede.1 This cult may go back to the Mycenaean period (note the goddess Ipemedeja on the Pylos linear B tablet Tn 2 1 62) and may have been connected at this early date with other sanctuaries along the Euboian strait at Brauron, Amarynthos, and perhaps Anthedon.3 It would, then, be natural for the patron goddess of Aulis to be invoked prior to the (real or imaginary) embarkation^) of the Greeks for Troy. Her character as goddess of wild animals would, equally naturally, lead her to be identified with Artemis, and thence to become, first her attendant,4 and later, as the story of the Trojan War developed, her victim.5 All of this seems to be plausible, and I should not be surprised if it turned out to be a more or less correct assessment. However, the origins of the cult must for now remain uncertain. The earliest document found in situ seems to be a boundary marker of archaic or classical date.6 The date of fifth century B.C. assigned to the temple was based by J. Threpsiades solely on his assessment of the architectural style7 (the traces of a late geometric structure found under the eastern end of the temple cannot be connected 1. Iphianassa: named by Homer {Iliad 9.145 and 287) as one of the three daughters of Agamemnon, and by the author of the Kypria (fr. 12 Ki) as one of four daughters, the fourth being Iphigeneia: the most commonly used name, from the Kypria on; Iphimede: Hesiod, fr. 23a MW. It is not certain that Homer knew about the sacrifice. He does not mention it, but he may have known and suppressed it as not being relevant to his story, see P. Clement, ACIass 3 (1934) 394 and note 2. Achilles' connection with the sacrifice of Iphigeneia may have originated with Agamemnon's offer to him in Iliad 9. It is developed in the Kypria (p. 19 Ki) and by later sources as an occurrence at Aulis. 2. See, for example, M. Gérard-Rousseau, Les Mentions Religieuses dans les Tablettes Mycéniennes = Incunabula Graeca 29 (Rome 1968) 116-118; see M.

He suggests that this is a place on the coast opposite Euboia (pp. 95, 98, 102, 104, .106). The tablets record shipments of wool to various places, some obviously sanctuaries. It is tempting to suggest that the place on the sea coast might have been Aulis. On these tablets, see A. Hurst, Eretria 5 (Bern 1976) 1 1.

See ALOADAI (ANTHEDON and THESPIAI). P. Clement, ACIass 3 (1934) 393-409, in a study of the origin of the Iphigeneia legend, has another to add to the list: Pägasai-Demetrias in Thessaly (401-407). Clement suggested that there was a connection with the Artemis of Aulis, whom he saw as a fertility goddess, with the epithet Iphigeneia, "she who causes the birth of strong offspring" (407). 4.

There may indeed have been continuous cult activity from the prehistoric period on, but we do not have the evidence for it, and we cannot overlook the possibility that it was the epic tradition which gave rise to a "reconstruction" of the sanctuary in conformity with it. Certainly there is no contemporary evidence for a temple (references to altars cannot be considered, as altars may be either temporary or permanent constructions) before Euripides, IA&gt; and the state of the text of this play is so uncertain that one cannot be sure when the lines referring to the temple were written.1 It is remarkable how carefully the epic tradition is followed in the later sanctuary: we find the plane tree and the spring mentioned by Homer, and the twin cult images described by Pausanias reflect the Artemis/Hekate grouping of the Hesiodic Catalogue. The sanctuary, as excavated, corresponds closely with the description by Pausanias and the objects depicted on coins of Tanagra.2 The excavator suggested that the temple was first built in the fifth century, had a prostoon added in the hellenistic period, and underwent further repairs in the Roman period, until, in the fourth or fifth century A.D., after it fell into disuse, part of it was used as a bath house. Aulis seems to have become a kind of tourist attraction, and we know of visits there by Agesilaos in 396 B.C. and Aemilius Paullus in 167 B.C.3 Inscriptions from the third century B.C. on also reflect this aspect of the sanctuary.4 This might also explain in part why potters' works were built near the temple, perhaps to provide visitors with souvenirs or votive offerings. The building described by Threpsiades as a hotel may have housed the visitors (Aulis seems always to have been a small place), although part of it at least may have been a dining hall, such as are found in other sanctuaries.5 The touristic attractions of Aulis were also represented on coins of Tanagra depicting the temple and other features of the sanctuary (see above note 2). We know little about the cult as it was actually practiced: two inscriptions of Roman date honour priestesses,6 and Pausanias notes that there was no restriction on the type of sacrifice that was acceptable to the goddess, but this may have been a reflection of the poverty of the goddess' worshippers at the time rather than a feature of particular significance for the cult. 1.

In addition, two sets of statues are dedicated to Artemis Eileithyia, presumably of children by their parents (JG 7.3410 and 341 1, see also 3413). Related to Artemis Eileithyia is Artemis Soodina, whose name appears with that of Apollo Daphnaphoros on the wall of the theatre at Chaironeia {IG 7.3407). See APOLLO (CHAIRONEIA). A priestess of Artemis is honoured by the city of Chaironeia, in an inscription which would appear to be from about the middle of the first century A.D. {IG 7.3430). See UNSPECIFIED (CHAIRONEIA).

G. Spyropoulos identified as the temple of Apollo Telphousios. Artemis would not be out of place in a sanctuary of Apollo, but, given the uncertainty attending the location of Telphousa, we ought perhaps to try to find another identity for this sanctuary, if possible. One that springs to my mind is the sanctuary of the Praxidikai, both because of its location near the western end of the Haliartia, and because, according to Dionysios (?of Chalkis) FHG 4 p.394F3, these goddesses were originally named Alkomenia, Thelxineia, and Aulis. The last name, of course, recalls Artemis. See APOLLO (TELPHOUSA) and PRAXIDIKAI (HALIARTIA). IG 7.2850 is dated in the Athenian archonship of Nikodēmos, i.e. 122/121 B.C.1 It is a decree of a synodos of hunters, honouring the Athenian epimeletes at Haliartos for his efforts as treasurer of the synodos. The decree was proposed by the priest of Artemis, and we may therefore regard this association as having placed itself under the protection of Artemis huntress (Agrotera or Agrotis, although the epithet does not appear).

ARTEMIS (KITHAIRON) The story of Aktaion's unhappy fate is linked on the one hand with Semeie, on the other with Artemis.2 It is difficult to say which association is earlier: the sparagmos motif points to the Dionysiac side, the motif of hunting to Artemis. I suppose that we must imagine Artemis, or the mistress of wild animals in whatever guise, to have been worshipped on Mount Kithairon. There is no evidence for an historical cult, except perhaps for Euripides, Phoinissai S02, where the chorus invokes ' Apxe y uôo s x^0V0TP0cP0V oyya Ku up gov , but this is rather inconclusive.

The inscriptions are on cylindrical bases, with cavities in the top to receive the feet of bronze statues. They may be dated in the fourth or third century B.C. The inscriptions, seen in situ by the original editors in April 1959, have been connected with the temple whose foundations H. Lolling saw and R.A. Tomlinson and J.M. Fossey described.1 When I first visited the site in the summer of 1958, 1 saw only the stone later published as SEG 18.166, although I may well have missed the other. Since then the stone I saw has disappeared, but that published as SEG 18.167 has been found again, downhill from the site.2 Presumably they both did come from the sanctuary, and the identification of the temple as one of Artemis is correct. The epithet also occurs nearby at Thisbe, and the goddess may have been worshipped as Agrotera at Thespiai, in whose territory Siphai lay. See ARTEMIS (THESPIAI) and (THISBE). The temple area yielded signs of use from the geometric to the hellenistic periods. In shape (long and narrow, insofar as it can be traced) the temple is similar to others in Boiotia.3 ARTEMIS (TANAGRA) Epithet: Eileithyia Inscriptions IG 7.546; 555; 832 Literature Pausanias 9.22.1 The inscriptions consist of a boundary stone of a sanctuary of Artemis {IG 7.546, ca. fifth century B.C.: from Aulis ?), a statue base with a dedication to Artemis Eileithyia by a man and his wife {IG 7.555, fourth or third century B.C.), and a stone plaque inscribed APT AMI E , and taken by Dittenberger to be a tombstone.4 Päusanias records (images of) Artemis and Leto in the temple of Apollo,5 that is, the Delian triad.

We may deduce from this that Eukleia Artemis possessed a circular altar in the agora; this ties in with Plutarch's statement in Aristeides 20 (33 IE) that Eukleia had an altar and cult image in every agora of Boiotia and Lokris. See ARTEMIS (UNSPECIFIED). Presumably the agora of fifth century Thebes was situated below the Kadmeia, as we know it to have been early in the fourth century.2 And, since Pausanias places an Agoraios Hermes in the vicinity of the temple of Eukleia Artemis (9.17.2), we may conclude that both he and Sophokles were writing about the same sanctuary. It is true that Sophokles does not mention a temple of the goddess, but this may not be significant. On the other hand, we are told by Pāusanias that the cult image was attributed to Skopas, who also worked at the Ismenion (Pausanias 9.10.2): see APOLLO (THEBES) A. ATHENA (THEBES). The temple may not have been built until the fourth century. The tradition of burying local heroes in the sanctuary of Eukleia - here it is Androkleia and Alkis - is repeated in Plataia - with Euchidas, see ARTEMIS (PLATAIA). On Androkleia and Alkis, see ANTIPOINIDES (THEBES). It may be that Pausanias saw a votive relief in or at the temple. See also DEMETER (ETEONOS).

Both of these monuments suffice to suggest that Artemis was worshipped at Thespiai as Agrotera: see ARTEMIS (SIPHAI) and (THISBE). Most of the remaining testimonia concern the cult of Artemis as Eileithyia (with the related epithets Lochia and Hagemone).2 Two fragmentary dedications seem to come from the vicinity of Episkopi, that is, possibly near the site of Askra.3 An unpublished inscription (in dialect) records a dedication by a group of men to Artemis Soteira (I am indebted for this information to Professor P.

From roughly the same period comes a dedication to Artemis Soteria (IG 7.2232), who later - in company with the imperial household and the polis - received a temple as a private offering (IG 7.2234). There is, finally, what may be an altar (hellenistic) belonging to Apollo and Artemis Agrotera (IG 7.3564): see ARTEMIS (SIPHAI) and (THESPIAI). See EMPERORS (THISBE). ARTEMIS (UNSPECIFIED) Epithet: Eukleia Plutarch, Aristeides 20 (33 1 E) Schol Sophokles, OT 161 According to Plutarch, although most people identified Eukleia with Artemis, some held her to be the daughter of Herakles and Myrto, who, after her death as a maiden, was honoured in Boiotia and Lokris: every agora had her altar and cult image, and preliminary sacrifices were offered to her by couples about to be married. The brief allusion in Schol Sophokles, OT 161, may well have come from Plutarch. The connections between Artemis and Eukleia - an independent goddess outside Boiotia and Lokris1 - are difficult to establish.2 On the one hand, the ritual mentioned by Plutarch places Eukleia with the Artemis who is patron of fertility; on the other hand, her sanctuaries in Plataia and Thebes are associated with aitia of warfare, more appropriately, one might think, for a goddess called Eukleia. Both Plutarch (writing of the Plataian cult) and Pausanias (writing of the Theban one) place the epithet first, before Artemis, which would suggest that the independent nature of Eukleia was fairly strongly felt. I suppose that the connection with Artemis may have been made by way of Artemis huntress: an Artemis armed might be associated easily enough with a patron goddess of warriors. See ARTEMIS (PLATAIA) and (THEBES). An unpublished inscription (in dialect) records a dedication by a group of men to Artemis Soteira (I am indebted for this information to Professor P. Roesch, who dates the inscription in the first half of the third century B.C.). The epithet is also found at Thisbe: see ARTEMIS (THISBE). 1. Plutarch is the only source lor the worship of Eukleia Artemis in Lokris. Could he mean places like Larymna, Ha lai, Kyrtones, Korseia, and Boumelitaia, which, at various times, were Boiotian? 2. Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen I (Berlin 1931) I 84 1 85, admitted defeat. M. Guarducci, SMSR 14 (1938) 1-1 1 and 15 (1939) 58 61 , suggested that in the beginning there was Eukleia, an independent goddess of the underworld, who subsequently was identified with Artemis, and later stood alone once more as a deification of human glory. This interpretation is rejected by M.P. Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion 1 (Munich 1955) 494 note 2. R. Hampe, RMitt 62 (1 955) 113-1 14, regards Eukleia as originally independent, and identified with Artemis later because of similarities between the two goddesses. 106</page><page sequence="114">[ASKALAPHOS and IALMENOS (ORCHOMENOS)] - ASKLEPIOS (HYETTOS) [ ASKALAPHOS and IALMENOS (ORCHOMENOS)] pseudo- Aristotle, fr. 640. 19R Reputed epitaph of Askalaphos and Ialmenos at Orchomenos.

One very fragmentary inscription - mentioned in BCH 76 (1952) 224 as one of several of varying date on a throne - seems to deal with the consecration of a garden to a sanctuary to Asklepios, but perhaps this too may turn out to be a manumission decree. In the manumission decrees mentioned in AM 30 (1905) 118 and in Fossey 617.32, Asklepios is linked with Hygieia. The inscriptions in AM were said to have come from Ayia Päraskevi, but this is as near as we can come to locating the sanctuary. ASKLEPIOS (HYETTOS) Epithet: Soter Association: Sacred Gerousia IG 7.2802 The inscription contains two decrees (after 212 A.D.) passed by Tņ Lepa yepouauą tou Euíttípos [ ' AļaKArļTi Lou 9 the first commemorating on stone the donation by two men (one [otv]iL ïïoàà&amp;v Kau yeyaÀcov, 5v euepyexndri Ttapà tou deou , the other ołtt euepyeoLag óyo[L]aç) of plots of land to the gerousia, the other stipulating regulations for the replacement of dead gerousiastai either by a son or by next of kin, and, apparently, for the admission of new members. Päusanias (9.24.3) refers to a temple of Herakles at Hyettos, in which there was an image of unwrought stone with healing powers: see HERAKLES (HYETTOS). Pausanias' visit to Hyettos would have pre-dated the inscription by between one and two generations. It is possible that the gerousia of Asklepios had no connection at all with the healing cult of Herakles; it may even be that our inscription is to be associated with the initial organization of the gerousia.1 The epithet Soter is common enough for Asklepios;2 the "Sacred Gerousia" is studied in the context of other gerousiai by J.H. Oliver.3 1 . Or with a re-organ izat ion, as suggested by R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Suppl. 3 (1976) 259, who (1 86-1 88, see 258) try to explain a connection between Herakles and Asklepios at Hyettos. What they have to say is quite interesting, but it does assume that such a connection existed, and this has not been established. There is no reason why the two cults should not have existed independently of each other, even in a relatively small town like Hyettos. 2. L.R.

As it happens, there is evidence of a flourishing cult of Asklepios, but from the hellenistic period only. Towards the eastern end of Akontion, A. de Ridder excavated the foundations of what may have been a temple, but which he took to be two porticoes. At the north-east corner of the structure were found votive offerings, some of the archaic period. A nearby tomb (no. 19) contained two stones inscribed with manumission decrees sworn before Asklepios -BCH 19 (1895) 157.1 and 161.2 - and from near the north-east corner of the structure came the fragmentary manumission decree BCH 19 (1895) 164.3. BCH 19 (1895) 167.7, a dedication to Asklepios, came from Tomb no. 8. The eastern "portico", by which were found the votive offerings, was held to be much older than the western one: de Ridder suggested that the former had originally been consecrated to a "chthonic" deity, perhaps Teiresias - see TEIRESIAS (ORCHOMENOS) - and that it was taken over by Asklepios only in the third century B.C., when the later "portico" was built (and to which all the surviving inscriptions are dated). He further suggested that Sarapis, before whom the manumission decrees were sworn in later periods, took over the sanctuary from Asklepios - see EGYPTIAN GODS (ORCHOMENOS). 1. On the latter, see L.R. Farnell, Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality (Oxford 1921) 277f. 2. See, for example, R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Suppl. 3 (1 976) 1 87-1 88; compare P.

Indeed, we cannot even be certain that the structure was ever a sanctuary of Asklepios, although the proximity of the inscriptions is suggestive. Two other inscriptions (IG 7.3191 and 3192) deal with contributions toward the temple of Asklepios.1 In summary then, the evidence as we have it attests cult activity within a limited period (the latter part of the third century B.C.), the building (or rebuilding) by public subscription of a temple and cult images, and the custom of manumitting slaves before Asklepios. What remains uncertain is the relationship between the cult of Asklepios and the so-called "Asklepieion", the identity of the deity worshipped at the latter, and the earlier history - if any - of the cult of Asklepios at Orchomenos.

It is a pity that the excavations conducted by N.G. Pappadakis have never been published, and I suppose it is too late to hope that they ever will be. The epithet appears as early as Homer, Iliad 4.8 = 5.908:wHpn x ' ' Apyeun xau ' AÀaÀHoyevriûS ' ASrļvn . Subsequently it varies between Alalkomeneis and Alalkomen(e)ia.3 Alalkomeneis in Homer is generally taken to be a geographical rather than a functional epithet, on the analogy of "Hpn ' Apye uri . 4 However, it need not follow that both epithets are geographical simply because one of them is, and although it would be pleasant to be able to take Homer as evidence for a cult of Athena at Alalkomenai, we cannot be certain of it. The situation might have been clearer if Alalkomenai had been in the Catalogue of Ships, or even in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. There is also the question of which Alalkomenai is being referred to, if any.5 The cult, therefore, may have been known to Homer, but we cannot be certain that it was. The testimony of Bakchylides is not much more satisfactory. Lactantius on Statius, Thebaid 7.330 summarizes thus: "Bacchylides Minervám Itoniam dixit et Alalcomenem6 ipsam significant" (fr. *15a Snell).7 The poet here seems to identify the two epithets, either through simple error (which seems un- likely), or because the two sanctuaries were near each other, or because there were closer, inherent, links between the two (see below). Despite the unsatisfactory state of the evidence, it seems on the whole likely that the cult of Athena at the Alalkomeneion was an old one: 1. The name appears in several forms: Alalkomeneion (IG 92.1.170 and Istros, FGrH 334F58b), Alalkomenion C htymologicum Magnum 56.8 ff. sv ' A'a'Kon€vriCq and Stephanos Byzantios w - he calls it a polis), Alkomenaion (BCH 29 [1905] 99.1). 2.

Fossey, Euphrosyne 6 (1973/1974) 8 note 6, rejects the Agoriani site (see p. 9.1), and seems to favour the sanctuary excavated by Th. G. Spyropoulos at Ayios Joannis Prodromos. Spyropoulos calls this the sanctuary of Apollo Telphousios; the only clue comes in the form of a dedication to Artemis. See APOLLO (TIXPHOUSA), ARTEMIS (HALIART1A), PRAXIDIKAI (HALIARTIA). Fossey identifies the site at Agoriani with the lost town of Eleusis (see below). The small female head in marble cited in ADelt 1 (1915) Hap. 42, came from Mamoura (now called Alalkomenai, as if things were not confused enough). 3.

It seems to me rather unusual that there should be two sanctuaries, both of considerable antiquity, of the same goddess, so close together. Were they connected in any way? We know that the Alalkomeneion existed independently at the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century B.C. (IG 9^.1.170), and we are told by Pausanias that the sanctuary continued in use until Sulla made off with the ancient ivory cult image, after which the temple was abandoned and allowed to fall into ruin (9.33.5- 7).5 The Itoneion, for its part, is attested from Alkaios on: see ATHENA (KORONEIA). It may be that the two sanctuaries did co-exist quite separately, but I find it difficult to believe that there was no connection at all between them. The Itoneion, after all, was the Boiotian national sanctuary: perhaps it was established at Koroneia as an assertion of national feeling, simply because Koroneia was near the already existing Alalkomeneion. Another possibility is that the Alalkomeneion - on the border between the territories of Haliartos and Koroneia - was the original site of the temple of Athena Itonia, and that it was at some time moved west to Koroneia (perhaps because the land around Alalkomenai was unsuitable for a large sanctuary),6 the old temple being maintained, naturally, as a sacred place.7 I cannot think of anything in the evidence which would make the latter explanation impossible. A number of motifs were linked more or less closely with the Alalkomenion at various times in antiquity: 1) The Praxidikai: this can be traced back to the fourth century B.C.; Alkomeneia is the name of one of the Ptaxidikai, daughters of Ogygos. The others are Aulis and Thelxinia, the first recalling Artemis in Boiotia, the second perhaps Hera (it is to be noted that the aition of the Daidala involves Alalkomenai: see HERA [PLAT AIA]); 2) The birth of Odysseus: invented to clear up the confusion among towns of the same name in different places. I do not take it seriously;8 1. Pausanias 9.33.5-7; Strabo 9.2.36 (413). 2.

IG 9.1.98 is not certain: it contains a treaty between the Boiotians and the Phokians, the oath in which is sworn by Zeus Basileus, Hera Basileia, Poseidon, Athena, and all the other gods and goddesses. The Athena could be Athena Kranaia (in whose temple at Elateia the inscription was found), or either Athena Itonia or Alalkomeneis/eia (all the other deities named are Boiotian, with federal significance). 4. It is interesting that of the few Boiotian month names found only in Boiotia, two - Pamboiotios and Alalkomenios - are connected with the patron goddess, Athena. 5. This may not be entirely accurate. The milestone BCH 29 (1905) 99.1 (second century A.D.), uses Alkomenaion (sic) as a landmark. 6. If the Alalkomeneion was, as Pausanias reports (9.33.5) on low-lying ground, it would have been subject to flooding. See below, on Eleusis and Athens. 7. This might explain why Bakchylidcs seems to confuse the two epithets, and why Homer does not mention Athena Itonia. 8. Istros, FGrH 334F58; Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 786 f.; Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae 43 (301D). Should the reader wish to see how seriously this can be taken, he may find much to wonder at in J.A.K.

Homer, Iliad 4.8, that Kekrops had given Athena the epithet Alalkomeneis. Kekrops also appears as the founder of the lost towns of Eleusis and Athens by the river Triton in the Haliartia.2 All of this looks rather suspicious to me, and I wonder whether any or most or indeed all of these traditions may not have been developed subsequent to the cession of the Haliartia to Athens in 1 71 B.C.;3 4) Alalkomeneus: the autochthon, who established the sanctuary, and reared Athena. The name may go back as far as traditions of Ogygos' flood. He is also involved in the aition of the Daidala. ATHENA (HALAI) Excavations and Site H. Goldman, Hesperia 9 (1940) 381-514 See also: H.

All were fairly small. The first is dated by the excavators somewhere near the beginning of the sixth century B.C. It was replaced towards the end of the sixth century by a second temple on the same site. This in turn was severely damaged by an earthquake (the disturbances of 426 and/or 425 B.C. are suggested) and repaired soon after. At some time during the fourth century B.C., when the circuit wall was rebuilt, the second temple was replaced by a third, of which little remains. The identity of the deity to whom this series of temples was consecrated is confirmed by two inscriptions: SEG 15.352, sixth century B.C., perhaps the first half (that is, roughly contemporary with the building of the first temple): recording a dedication to Athena;4 Schwyzer, DGE 359, early sixth century B.C.: a base of a dedication by the people of Halai to Athena. 1.

The simplest interpretation is that the mason made a mistake, and that the statue with which the inscription went was dedicated to Athena.1 An inscription from the last third of the third century B.C. contains what is apparently the beginning of a long public document. From what survives, it would appear that the stone dealt with sacred matters, possibly the administration of a sanctuary:2 after the date (and a list of public officials, their names in the genitive case3), comes a list of officials in the nominative case: three uexayvuipavTepau (female), four TcevTayepou (male, as are those who follow), four Tootpoü,4 two ÀavïïdcTtapxou, three or more xaudAoyou.5 One would expect, from the format, that these people, from the three women on, were submitting a report concerning some religious matter, perhaps the preparation or restoration of a cult image.6 Miss Goldman's suggestion that the uexayvucpavTepau were the weavers of the spreading-cloth, or robe for the cult image, of Athena, has been generally accepted. The attribution to Athena may be correct - the inscription comes from a well inside the sanctuary precinct - but it is not certain. ATHENA (HAUARTOS) Epithet: Itonia Excavations and Site R.P.

There is an oddly- shaped temenos wall, enclosing the remains of perhaps two phases of building: the earlier survives as a section of wall, the later as what has been identified as the western end of a building approximately 7.1 by 18m (the eastern part of this structure ends in rubble). The excavator identified these as the remains of temples, the first of the seventh century B.C. at the latest, the second ca. 550 B.C. or soon after. Outside the south-west corner of the temenos, foundations of a "long hall" running north-south were found, Outside the west wall of the temenos, was a deposit of matter, including fragments of two vases -BSA 32 (1931/1932) 187 fig. 4 and 199.1; 200.3a - dated ca. 500 B.C. and fifth century respectively, bearing dedications to Athena. The conclusion, with which one must concur, is that the sanctuary belonged to Athena. Excavation - both by Austin and more recently by Th. G. Spyropoulos - has failed to reveal any trace of the temple farther east than a point 5.5 m east of its west wall. It may be that there never was a temple, and that what we have is an altar. It is doubtful that the Kallimachos passage can be taken as a reference to the cult of Athena at Haliartos.1 The inscription SEG 25.556, as re-read by Professor P. Roesch (who has generously made his reading available to me in advance of its publication), deals with a request from the city of Akraiphia, inviting Haliartos to participate in the Ptoia: see APOLLO (PTOION). Haliartos is also asked to perform a sacrifice in the temenos of Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios. Athena Itonia was, of course, the chief deity at the religious centre of the Boiotians at Koroneia. This goddess, we are told, shared her temple at Koroneia with a god called variously Zeus or Hades, and, probably, depicted on a vase of the sixth century B.C. as a snake. It seems reasonable to suggest that the god at Koroneia was Zeus Karaios, too: see ATHENA (KORONEIA) and ZEUS (AKRAIPHIA, ANTHEDON, HALIARTOS, KORONEIA, ORCHOMENOS, THESPIAI, UNSPECIFIED). Why Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios should have been worshipped together at Haliartos is an interesting question. It may always have been so: on the other hand, perhaps the proximity of the national sanctuary at Koroneia influenced the Haliartans to add Zeus to their Athena; perhaps, again, the proximity of Haliartos to the federal capital at Onchestos was instrumental in bringing Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios together at Haliartos. It may also be remarked that there is no direct evidence that the temenos of the inscription is identical with the temple of Athena on the akropolis of Haliartos: it could have been somewhere in the territory of Haliartos, possibly in the direction of Onchestos.2 1. The poet is concerned to set the scene for the misadventure of Teiresias. This takes place on Mount Helikon; the episode is introduced by having Athena call in at several towns in Boiotia - Thespiai, Haliartos, Koroneia, and perhaps one other (in line 61 , where the MSS give Koroneia, which is repeated in line 63, where a sketch of the goddess' sanctuary is given. Wilamowitz removed the first reference to Koroneia) - which, surely by design rather than accident, are situated on the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Helikon. 2. During one of the brief periods when Haliartos minted its own coins (that dated by Head 387-374 B.C.), the coins depict Poseidon or his trident on the reverse, a sure indication that at the time Haliartos laid claim to Onchestos as part of its territory: see B.V. Head, Historia Nu moru m (Oxford 191 1) 345. It is not impossible that even during the period of the hcllcnistic koinon, this claim was not forgotten, and may be reflected in our inscription, in the reference to a temenos of the two national gods of Boiotia within the polis of Haliartos. 116</page><page sequence="124">ATHENA (KORONEIA) ATHENA (KORONEIA) Epithet(s): Itonia (Iodama) Agon: Pamboiotia Excavations and Site Th.

We may suppose that the Boiotoi, or such of them as had worshipped Athena Itonia/is in Thessaly, brought their patron goddess with them, and installed her at or near Koroneia. For the relationship of this sanctuary to the Alalkomeneion, see ATHENA (ALALKOMENAI). A site just to the north of the akropolis of Koroneia has been identified as the sanctuary of Athena Itonia. No definite information has been found to confirm this identification, but there is no doubt about the religious character of the buildings (three have been found, of which at least one - Building "A" - &gt;yas apparently built around the middle of the sixth century B.C.), and the identification seems to me to have considerable merit.3 2) The Deities a) Athena The chief goddess of the Itoneion was Athena, who is named by the earliest source, Alkaios. The epithet Itonia occurs in Bakchylides ancf Pindar, without the name Athena, but with obvious reference to this cult. The epithet seems to mean "the goddess from Iton(os)", a reference, one may presume, to her Thessalian origin. Whatever the goddess' character may have been in her original home,4 it is clear that at Koroneia she was a patroness of warriors. Alkaios addresses her asTtoXeyáôoKe; and, on a Boiotian black-figure lekane of the sixth century in the British Museum (B80), which, it is generally accepted, depicts incidents in the Koroneian cult,5 the goddess is in warlike guise, helmeted, shield on one arm, spear brandished above the head.6 Two other Boiotian vases of similar date, in the Louvre (CAI 446 and CAI 707), depicting a warrior Athena, have also been linked with this cult. In the fifth century, Bakchylides wrote of the temple xPUaotLyuôos ' lTO)Vuas (fr. 15), and Koroneian coins of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. bear on their reverse either the gorgoneion or the helmeted head of the goddess. And, among the ruins of Building "B", was a herm, inscribed with a prayer offering to Nike (AAA 6 [1973] 389.3). 1. Strabo 9.2.29 (411). See Hekataios, FGrH 1F2; Armenidas FGrH 378F1 ; Alexandros, FGrH 273F92 (all three quoted by Schol. Apollonios Rhodios 1 .551a); Simonides Keios, FGrH 8F1 . On the Thessalian origins, see, for example, L. Moretti, Ricerche Sulle Leghe Greche (Rome 1962) 100; F. Kiechle, Lakonien und Sparta (Munich 1963) 261 note 3. Lykos, FGrH 380F2, looks like a confusion between Theban and Thessalian traditions. The story of the "Thracian Ruse" - told by Ephoros, FGrH 70F1 19 (quoted by Strabo, not located at Koroneia), Polyainos 7.43, and Zenobios 4.37 - might be connected with an early stage of the sanctuary's history, but any attempt to try to pin it down would be fruitless. 2.

Taken in isolation, this could be regarded as a purely conventional depiction of the goddess. We may note, in passing, that this goddess, if she is Athena Itonia, does not carry the "Boiotian shield", which would be another argument against the theory that the shield was originally that of Athena Itonia. See L. Lacroix, RBelge 36 (1958) 7-30. 119</page><page sequence="127">ATHENA (KORONEIA) The warlike aspect of the Itonian Athena may perhaps be reflected in the epithet Alalkomeneis/eia: see ATHENA (ALALKOMENAI). It may also be seen in the name Iodama, which, depending on the correctness of the accepted etymology, could have begun its career not as the name of an independent predeçessor of Athena, but rather as a qualitative epithet of the goddess, much like TioÀeyáôoxoç or aAaAxoyevri^s/E^a.1 Athena Itonia was served by a priestess. We find her depicted on the aforementioned lekane B80 in the British Museum, wearing clothes identical with the goddess', except for the armour. And, aside from the fact that the aition which Pausanias related of Iodama names her as priestess of Athena, there is also in his account, a yuvn, who lit the fire every day on the altar of Itonia. She must have been a real priestess, perhaps subordinate to a chief priestess, one of whom, Flavia Laneika, is honoured on IG 7.3426, an inscription roughly contemporary with Pausanias' visit (she wasxriv apx^epeuav | ôuà ßuou tou Te xouvou Bouu)tc5v Tris | ' Itûjvlolç 'Adnvaç xaù tou houvou $u)|&gt;íea)V êdvouç xaù T ñs 'Oyovouas t&amp;v | 'EAAtÎvcov Ttapa t&amp; Tpocpcavu^) . b) The Cult Complex Athena had a consort at Koroneia. In the sixth century, this god seems to have taken the form of a snake, as depicted on the lekane B80 in the British Museum: between the altar and the pillar which represents the temple, there are what look like statues of Athena and the snake (the latter on a stand). The snake motif is found on another Boiotian vase of the sixth century (Louvre CAI 446: snakes with the warrior Athena). In the fifth century, if Pausanias' informants were right, Agorakritos created two bronze cult images of Athena and Zeus.2 We might assume that the snake god on the sixth century vase was, therefore, the chthonic Zeus, and indeed Strabo's statement that auyxa^uôpUTat ôè Tņ ' h%r'vą ó AuôriS xaTcí Tuva, a¡$ cpaauv, yuaTUxriv ai» t tav (9.2.29 [411] )3 may be taken to confirm this assumption. It also seems reasonable to assume that until the fifth century Athena's consort at Koroneia was theriomorphic,4 and that when an anthropomorphic image was demanded of the sculptor, he selected the nearest conventional representation, i.e. the chthonic Zeus or Hades. However, we come no nearer to the origins of this snake god by calling him by either name. 1. For the etymology of Iodama, see W. Pape/G.E. Benseler, Wörterbuch der Griechischen Eigennamen (Braunschwieg 1884) 553, and Gunning, RE 9 (1916) sv "Iodama" 1840-1 841. See also HERAKLES (THEBES) concerning the etymology of lolaos. This interpretation of Iodama may find some support from Simonides Keios, FGrH 8F1 (Athena and Iodama, daughters of Itonos, were rivals tt'v bir'o^a'ucr¡u, and in the event, Iodama was killed by Athena). The story in Pausanias, 9.34.2, about Iodama 's being turned into stone, may have developed as an aition to explain an archaic kore. 2. These works are dealt with, at rather greater length than the available data would appear to justify, by G.I. Despinis.

Gagcncs, supported by Athena and Ares respectively, be used to support a claim for Ares at Koroneia. It is, rather, a local variant of the conventional grouping Athena/ Herakles v. Kyknos/ Ares: see F. Vian, REA 47 (1945) 5- 32, and S.Karouzou,£C// 79 (1955) 177-204, esp. 1 86 ff. I can offer no explanation for Strabo's m votimi nç aìria. 4. This raises the possibility that Athena too was theriomorphic, perhaps as a snake herself (see Louvre CA 1446), or as a bird, in this case a crow: note the birds on B80 and BCH 99 (1 975) 434.35 (Athens, National Museum CC6174 Inv. 289). 120</page><page sequence="128">ATHENA (KORONEIA) It is likely that in the hellenistic period, Athena Itonia's consort bore the name Zeus Karaios: this pair is found at Haliartos - see ATHENA (HALIARTOS).1 The epithet appears (as Karaios or Keraios) in most parts of Boiotia, and it may safely be claimed that this Zeus was a truly pan-Boiotian god: see ZEUS (AKRAIPHIA, ANTHEDON, HALIARTOS, KORONEIA, ORCHOMENOS, THESPIAI, UNSPECIFIED).2 It may be that Zeus Karaios was the original chthonic/serpentine consort of Athena Itonia; it is, however, equally possible that this "pan-Boiotian" Zeus was identified with the consort of the pan-Boiotian Athena only at a later date, perhaps when the Itoneion officially became a federal sanctuary (it is to be remembered that there is no evidence for its having this status in the archaic period). Other deities are found at the Itoneion, but this is only to be expected in an important sanctuary, and there is no reason to suppose that there was any basic connection with the central cult of the sanctuary: Ares: See above, p. 120 note 3. Hermes: On Louvre CAI 446 (ca. middle of the sixth century), Hermes appears facing Athena. A. Waiblinger, the editor of CV A France 26 Louvre 17, wonders if this scene is to be associated with the cults of Zeus Meilichios and Athena Itonia. The theme is apparently rare in Greek pottery, and there may be some local significance.3 Nike: See above, Part 2a. The inscription is tentatively dated by P. Roesch ( Teiresias E.76.16) as early Imperial. Charités: Pausanias writes that àvedeaav ôe xaù XapuTWV ayaAyaxa éu'éyou (9.34.10). See CHARITES (KORONEIA), and compare IG 13426 (see above, Part 2a), for more evidence of activity in the second century A.D. Emperors: Pritchett, Studies 2.87, publishes a fragmentary inscription from Mamoura (now Alalkomenai), which might be restored as the dedication of a statue of Trajan,4 but this, of course, is not evidence for the Imperial cult. Demeter: See DEMETER (KORONEIA/ORCHOMENOS). 1. See ATHENA (HALIARTOS) (on the inscription SEG 25.556). Compare IG 7.4145, combined by M. Holleaux,i?C7/ 16 (1892) 458.iii, with another fragment to give a decree of Koroneia in honour of two arbitrators from Akraiphia. Lines 4-6 of the combined inscription were restored by M.

For what it is worth, Pausanias (9.34.3) mentions an altar of Hermes Epimelios in the agora at Koroneia. See HERMES (KORONEIA). 4. The reading is based on the photograph in Studies 2.

Almost all of the epigraphical, and most of the literary, evidence comes from the second period, which itself can be further subdivided into periods of greater or lesser activity. a) First Period The Boiotian black-figure lekane of about the middle of the sixth century B.C., British Museum B80, depicts on its outside scenes from a religious festival, which A.D. Ure plausibly attributed to this cult (see above, p. 1 19 note 5). We see Athena1 and her serpentine consort, standing between their temple and an altar, on which a flame burns and a bird is perched.2 Approaching the altar is a procession led by a woman, that is, the priestess, bearing on her head a flat basket or tray.3 Behind her comes the sacrificial bull, escorted by male attendants, and several other officials; they in turn are followed by a cartload of people and a marshal, obviously intended to represent the "audience" at the panegyris. The rest of the space is filled with a scene of four men advancing on a goat - either an independent scene, or one depicting the procurement of a goat to be sacrificed to the snake god4 - and two other men holding wreaths, with a large bird perched on the calf of one of them. Other Boiotian vases of about the same period seem to belong to the same series; they too may be connected, at least tentatively, with the Itoneion and its cults. They depict a sacrificial procession,5 cult ceremonies,6 festive revelry,7 and agonistic activity.8 If the attribution of these vases to the cult at Koroneia is correct, then it may be said that the cult was celebrated by a panegyris, which included not only sacrifices, but also an agon (athletic and hippie), and attendant revelry for the mass of participants. 1. The goddess' stance - poised as if to advance - might argue against her being taken as the cult image, but compare the bronze statuette of the warrior Athena from the Athenian akro polis (Athens, National Museum 6447): CI. Rolley, Monumenta Graeca et Romana 5. Greek Minor Arts 1. The Bronzes (Leiden 1967) 4.42 and IG 1 .426 (first quarter of the fifth century B.C.). Note that on the vase no attempt is made to distinguish divine and human figures by size; indeed the human figures are drawn to varying scales, according to the amount of space available. 2. Could the bird be a crow, in punning reference to the name Koroneia? Could it be a raven? For legendary associations between the raven and the Boiotoi see Photios, Lexikon , sv èç KÓpamç. Actually, it looks more like a goose. On Boiotian geese, sec D'A.W. Thompson, A Glossary of Greek Birds (London 1936) 327, and note Herkynna and the goose at Lebadeia (Pa usa nias 9.39.3). See M.W. de Visser, Die Nicht Menschengestaltigen Götter der Griechen (Leiden 1903) 175.247 (geese); 139.155 (Kopanes at Alalkomenai); 192.268 (crow and Athena at Koronę in Messenia); 207.279 (crow - or raven - and Apollo at Korone). On the other hand, the bird may have no special siginficance. 3. It is remarkable how closely the scene up to this point matches the description of the sanctuary and ritual in Pausanias. It is an unusual and rare example of cult survival (or revival, this time accurately, which is even more rare). 4. This is Mrs Ure's idea: JHS 49 ( 1 929) 1 70. 5. BCH 99 (1975) 433.16. 6.

We cannot say if this festival was already "pan-Boiotian" in scope. If it was - as were the later Pamboiotia - then it may have been organized by one of the early Boio+tan confederacies.1 The next activity we hear of at the sanctuary is the dedication of a trophy there to commemorate the battle of 447 B.C.2 After the battle of 394 B.C., some of the defeated Boiotians took refuge in the temple and were spared by Agesilaos.3 b) Second Period4 Towards the end of the fourth century B.C. or early in the third, the Delphic inscription IG 9^.1.170 records a treaty between the Boiotians and the Aitolians and Phokians. Copies of this treaty were to be set up in sanctuaries (federal, one presumes) in each region, the Boiotian sanctuaries being Onchestos, the Alalkomeneion, and Koroneia. This is the earliest written evidence (except for the possible reference in Pindar) of the sanctuary's national role5 (see below, Part 4). A few decades later, in 266/265 or 262/261 B.C., the Amphiktyonic decree SEG 18.240 declares that the sanctuary is to be asylon.6 This may be part of a dossier concerning the granting of a sacred truce and right of asylum to the Itoneion: that there was a sacred truce and that the sanctuary had the right of asylum is clear from Polybios, who writes of the Aitolians' having broken the truce of in v x&amp;v naygoucoTtujv itavnyup u v (4.3.5, see 9.34.1 1), and having auXnaauev to t r,s ' A$nvãç ins 'iTíjDVuas uepòv eûpTivriS UTtapxoiîariS (4.25.2) in the period 229-224 B.C.7 Polybios provides the earliest evidence for the name of the panegyris. If SEG 18.240 does refer to the Boiotian Itoneion, it might be argued that the Pamboiotia as celebrated in the hellenistic period were organized during the second quarter of the third century B.C., but whether this was an initial 1. I say "one" of the early confederacies because the evidence from the vases would seem to pre-date the institution of a confederacy under Theban auspices (unless, of course, the dates suggested are all of them too low). On Boiotian politics (insofar as anything is known about the subject) during the archaic and early classical periods, see, for example,: R.J. Buck, ClassPhil 67 (1972) 94 ff.;G. Busolt/H.

The festival would, it is logical to assume, have been celebrated during the month of Pamboiotios (September / October). Most of the relevant inscriptions concern the agonistic aspect of the Pamboiotia. They fall into three chronological groups - hellenistic, first century B.C., and imperial2 - and reflect not only the changing character of the agon, but also the survival of a sense of identity as Boiotians, even when the concept had ceased to have any political meaning. i) Hellenistic The documents are IG 7.3087, SEG 3.354 and 355, and Chiron 6 (1976) 15.8. They are dedications by military units of different Boiotian towns to commemorate victories at the Pämboiotia. They are not victors' lists, and the Pamboiotia may have included - as they did later - a full range of individual competitions. These inscriptions refer to team competitions held among military contingents from towns in Boiotia, competitions which may have been a means of testing the level of proficiency of the detachments of the federal army, and, by extension, a means of raising that level.3 ii) First Century B.C. There is a large gap between the inscriptions of the second half of the third century B.C. and the next group, which belong to the first century B.C. This may be accidental, and future discoveries may fill the gap, but I think it more likely that the Pamboiotia were suspended after the dissolution of the koinon in 171 B.C.4 Some decades after the hellenistic koinon was dissolved, there was a partial revival, but only in the cultural, that is, religious and agonistic, field.5 It was not a political association at all. The problem of dealing with "federal" festivals without the existence of a federal administration seems to have been dealt with by the expedient of making use of the only federal magistracy which survived the dissolution; this was the college of naopoioi, organized to direct the construction of the temple of Zeus Basileus at Lebadeia6: see ZEUS (LEBADEIA). This task remaining unfinished, the naopoioi continued to function (since their role was religious and administrative, they would have posed no political threat to the Romans). 1. The only argument is that from silence, but it may derive some support from the fact that the victory at Leuktra was celebrated by an agon held, not at Koroneia, where one might expect exultant Boiotians to have set it, but at Lebadeia: see ZEUS (LEBADEIA). In any case, the political situation in the fourth century B.C., both during the hegemony of Thebes and after the battle of Chaironeia, would have militated against the existence of a pan-Boiotian panegyris at Koroneia at this time. Such a festival may have existed earlier, as we have seen above, but it could hardly have survived without interruption. 2. A number of other inscriptions have at one time or another been associated with the Pamboiotia, but in every case the attribution is uncertain: ADelt 2 (1916) 218.A0'- on which, see AKRAIA (KORONEIA) -'BCH 18 (1894) 534.3; 76 (1952) 224; IG 7.1745; 2466; 2714; 3088. 3. This may have been a consequence of the re-organization of the federal army, ca. 250-245 B.C.: see M. Feyel, Polybe et l'Histoire de Bèotie au lile Siècle avant notre Kre (Paris 1942) 197, and compare J. Beloch, Klio 6 (1906) 44; P. Roesch, Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 67; R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Supplément 3 (1976) 269-270. One wonders whether the story told by Plutarch, A ma toriae Narrationes 4 (774E-775A) may not be connected with the hellenistic Pamboiotia. We know nothing about the frequency of the Pamboiotia, which A. Plassart,2?C7/ 50 (1926) 397, called a "féte annuelle". It does not follow from the fact that there was a month called Pamboiotios that the festival was annual: the Agrionia, for example, which were probably celebrated in Agrionios, were trieteric. See DIONYSOS (THEBES). 4. See R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Supplément 3 (1976) 342-347. Strabo, 9.2.29 (41 1) writes that kvravda ôè mi rà IIa/Lij3occjrta ovvereXovv, as if they were a thing of the past, but during his lifetime the Pamboiotia were celebrated (see below). Unfortunately, one never knows with Strabo whether one is reading his own words or citations from earlier authors. 5. See P.

There are two such, the Basileia at Lebadeia,1 and the Pamboiotia. In the case of the latter, a decree of the koinon of the Boiotoi was passed in 37 A.D. in honour of Epameinondas of Akraiphia: the magistrates in charge and the occasion on which the decree was passed are stated to be tous aúvua | [a] u vauououous èv xņ uavriyupeu xöv Iîay 3ou(jotuo)V (/G 7.271 1, lines 55-56. Epameinondas was to have a painting of himself on a gilded shield set up in the temple of Eitonia [s/c] Athena).2 The inscriptions of the first century B.C. consist of three partial victors' lists, IG 7.2871 and 1764, and Pritchett, Studies 2.88B. The first - IG 7.2871 - was found at Mamoura (now Alalkomenai).3 It is the beginning of a list of victors in an athletic/hippic agon, unnamed. IG 7.1764 and Pritchett, Studies 2.88B,4 are parts of similar lists. IG 7.1764 was originally attributed to the Erotideia at Thespiai, where it was found, but M. Feyel demonstrated that it must have been a "pierre errante", and concerned the same agon as/G 7.2871. 5 Feyel, however, assigned these two inscriptions (he did not know of the third) not to the Pamboiotia, but to the Basileia at Lebadeia.6 His reasons were twofold: first, the panegyris of IG 7.2871 was directed by naopoioi, and was therefore "federal", as were the Basileia at this time; second, IG 7.2871 and 1764 list competitions for individuals, which is not possible for the Pämboiotia, in which the competitions were for groups. I disagree with Feyel's attribution t b the Basileia.7 It is not in fact difficult to show that these inscriptions did not concern the Basileia: the victors' lists of the Basileia at the time contain different competitions from those listed in IG 7.2871 and 1764, and furthermore, the Basileia attracted participants from all parts, while the victors in IG 7.2871 (and, as far as can be determined, in 1764 as well) were all Boiotians.8 It may also be possible to show that these inscriptions cannot concern any other agon than the Pamboiotia, for the following reasons: 1) IG 7.2871 and 1764 are both victors' lists, but the Pamboiotia inscriptions of the third century B.C. are not (see above). One can therefore not compare the two groups of inscriptions as being equivalent. There is also the fact that there was a gap of about a century and a half between the two groups; it is difficult to believe that, given the vicissitudes in Boiotian affairs during the interval, the Pamboiotia could have remained unchanged; 2) despite Feyel's statement to the contrary, IG 7.2871 and 1764 do each contain a group competition (lines 17 and 8 respectively); 1.

(IG 7.271 1), but not what occurred during the panegyris at this time. There was at any rate a molvov IlaygottüTüjv auveôptov (IG 7.2712), which corresponds to the ho u vos . . . atfXAoyos of the Boiotoi mentioned by Pausanias (9.34.1); there is, however, no evidence for continuity between 37 A.D. and Pausanias, except for the fact that Plutarch, Amatoriae Narrationes 4 (774E-775 A), writes of the Pamboiotia as a festival well known to his readers. In any case it is clear that the Boiotians of Pausanias' day did assemble at the Itoneion,2 not only from Pausanias himself, but also from IG 7 .3426 (see above, Part 2a). ^ In addition to meetings of this assembly, there were also, apparently, daily rites performed by a priestess (Pausanias 9.34.2). 4) The Itoneion as a Federal Centre I have already mentioned the possibility of some kind of amphiktyonic organization in the archaic and classical periods, but the only firm evidence for the use of this sanctuary as a federal centre comes from hellenistic and Roman times; the earliest datable document is the treaty recorded on IG 92.1.170 (see above, Part 3b). 1 . There are two apparent exceptions. The first is the victor in tirn^ iru&gt;'iļ&gt; ôtavXov , one Aulus Castricius Auli filius. He is a Roman, or rather, an Italian, and his appearance in this list might seem to disprove my contention. Indeed, M. Hollea ux, Etudes d' Epigraphie et d'Histoire Grecques I (Paris 1 938) 140 note 3 (originally published in 1906), used the presence of Aulus Castricius as an argument against the regionalism of the Pamboiotia. But in fact this Roman/Italian was a resident of Boiotia, perhaps even of Koroneia; he belonged to the family of Castricii, who lived in Boiotia, and especially in the region of Thespiai: see J. Hatzfeld, Les Trafiquants italiens dans l'Orient hellénique (Paris 1919) 68-69 and 72; Bull, èpigr. 38.145 and 59.184; L. Robert, Hellenica 2 (1946) 8-9. An inscription from Koroneia (IG 7.2873) records a dedication by another member of this family, possibly a freedman: see Dittenberger on IG 7.2873; Hatzfeld p. 72; and U. Kahrstedt, An Wirtschaftliche Gesicht Griechenlands in der Kaiserzeit (Bern 1954) 86. The other apparent exception is in the list of competitions in IG 7.287 1 , where we find [a | ràbuov ck itLvtojv. The term €k návrejv probably meant, as it did elsewhere, that this competition was open to competitors from all parts: see T. Klee, Zur Geschichte der Gymnischen A ganen an Griechischen besten (Leipzig -Berlin 1918) 40, and the commentary on IG 2^.957. The obvious deduction is that, if one compétition is stated to be open to all, then the rest must be restricted to certain competitors. In the Athenian Theseia of the second century B.C., in which military prowess was tested, participation was restricted to Athenians, except for those termed eie iràurujv. The competitions of the Theseia, and those of IG 7.2871 , were similar in type, although on different scales. One wonders if the Pämboiotia of the first century B.C., as revealed by IG 7.2871 , were not in fact modelled on the Theseia, one patriotic agon on another, l'or the Theseia, see IG 2^.956 -958, 960-962, 964, and L. Deubner, Attische beste (Berlin 1932) 224 ff. 2. Pausanias 9.34.1 . 3. This statue was dedicated by the lady's son, whose public offices included that of Boiotarch.

Not enough excavation has been conducted at Onchestos to determine whether the sanctuary was only an administrative capital, or also a religious centre: see POSEIDON (ONCHESTOS). As for the Itoneion, it would appear to have been a religious gathering place, and not a political capital. To be sure, federal proxeny decrees were set up there.1 This should not be surprising, since, as the sanctuary at Koroneia was frequented regularly for the Pämboiotia, it was only good sense to set up federal honorific, and possibly other, decrees there, in order to gain the maximum possible readership. In any case, Koroneia was not the only Boiotian sanctuary in which federal proxeny decrees were set up; Oropos is a case in point: nobody claims that the Amphiareion was a federal sanctuary, but the koinon did use it for some of its proxeny decrees. It was probably a mixture of sentiment, tradition, and folk memory, that led to the selection of the Itoneion as a federal religious centre. Onchestos, on the other hand, with its more central location, was better suited to be the political and administrative centre for the hellenistic koinon. In later centuries, when the koinon ceased to have any political meaning, the capital moved to the old religious centre at Koroneia, and whatever decrees this emasculated koinon passed were passed by the naopoioi meeting at the Itoneion on the occasion of the Pämboiotia.2 ATHENA (OROPOS) Epithet: Päionia Pausanias 1 .34.3 Athena Päionia on the great altar at the Amphiareion.

If the restoration is correct, then obviously this stone came from Koroneia. The other two stones, containing 286-288 and 289-292 respectively, have no recorded provenance. On the basis of similarities with the rest, P. Roesch attributes all to Koroneia (accepted by SEG). Another federal proxeny decree (for two or more people) is to be seen in the fragmentary inscription from Mamoura published by W.K. Pritchett, Studies 2.88A. Other statues known to have been set up at the Itoneion were those of Antiochos (Livy 36.20), and Trajan (see above, p. 121 note 4). 2. This would explain why imperial documents were inscribed at Koroneia. The daily rite of lighting the fire on the altar of Itonia (Pausanias 9.34.2) may mean that the sanctuary was regarded as the sacred hearth of Boiotia. 127</page><page sequence="135">ATHENA (PLATAI A) - ATHENA (TANAGRA) One of the sights to see at Plataia was the temple of Athena Areia, which contained a cult image by Pheidias, and, in the pronaos, paintings by Polygnotos and Onasias.1 The temple and its contents were still there in Pausanias' day. According to Päusanias, the temple was built from the booty of the battle of Marathon, but Plutarch says that, after the battle of Plataia, eighty talents were allocated to the Plataians and used for the sanctuary, the cult image, and the paintings. One might, if one wished, reconcile the discrepancy by reading áv^xoôduncrav instead of (¡jxoôóyncrav in Plutarch (there is manuscript authority for both: see the apparatus criticus ); it might then be assumed that the money was granted to repair the damage presumably done to the building begun after 490 B.C. Attempts to locate the temple have not succeeded,2 and there is no record of cult activity.3 ATHENA (PTOION) Epithet(s): (Laisia) Pronaia Ducat, KP( 251.142); 396.249; 409.257; (41 1.260); 412.261 ; 416 note 4; 419.268; 419.269a; 443 See APOLLO (PTOION), Pärts 4 and 6.c.l.

Unfortunately, it survives only in Lolling's copy. There are two lines, of which the first (very fragmentary) contains the dedication, and the second (the size of the intervening space is not known) the sculptor's signature. These two lines are similar to the first and last lines of IG 7.2463 from Thebes, also copied by Lolling. IG 7.2463 was re-edited by Keramopoullos in AM 33 (1908) 211-214, and in his version the sculptor, Histiaios of Athens in IG 7, becomes Lysistratos of Athens, the same sculptor as on IG 7.553, although there he is a Theban. Between the first and last lines is a list of twenty-two names in two columns. The inscription has since been re-read by P. Roesch (not published). Where, in the first line, Dittenberger had read to [ù]auv [§'5]tt1 ' Adavri a ávedeav, and Keramopoullos had read to[C] ouv^iÌtti ' A§avauaaTTļ ótveduav, he sees traces of a lambda after Athena, and a clear alpha before the last word. Similarly, in the first line of IG 7.553, he reads traces of a lambda after Athena. The similarity between these two inscriptions is striking, and one wonders even if Lolling might not have mixed up his files, and given us two inscriptions where there was only one. But, assuming, as we must, that there were two inscriptions, and that they both belong where they were found, then we must assume either a common dedication by two groups of synthytai, or a dedication by one group in two places. The recipient is Athena L- -. The only epithet known for Boiotia which begins with an L is Longatis, given by Lykophron, Alexandra 520, see Schol : I leave out of the question Athena "Laisia" at the Ptoion, see APOLLO (PTOION). With Longatis, the two inscriptions could be restored thus: IG 7.553: tou quv^utti ['Ada]vři Atoyyáxuôu] àveduav. IG 7.2463: to [l] auvdUTri 'A^avri A[oyyaxuóu to ayaÀy]a aveduav.

Later sources derived the epithet from the gates, instead of vice versa , with the result that they call the goddess Onkaia. A third variant, Onga, may, as Hesychios suggested, be a local dialect form.1 Scholarly attempts in late antiquity to explain the epithet linked it with the earliest period in Theban history, that is, the foundation by Kadmos, and derived the word either from the lowing of the cow which Kadmos sacrificed to Athena, or tried to give foreign etymologies, either Phoenician or Egyptian.2 1.

It is possible, I suppose, that the original significance of Onka may have had something to do with the war-cry. This would not be unsuitable for a goddess invoked - as Athena Onka is - as protectress of the city.1 Aischylos leads us to believe that the sanctuary of Athena Onka was not actually on the Kadmeia, but just outside it, near the gates. She was, as F. Vian puts it, the guardian of the gates, whose function was to defend the city from her enemies.2 The sanctuary that Pausanias was shown was situated somewhere to the south of the Kadmeia, and probably near the western edge, and consisted of an altar and cult image in the open air. There is some evidence that there may once have been a temple of Athena at Thebes. Sophokles, in fact, mentions two of them, without identifying them further.3 Euripides has Eteokles invoke Athena, after ITaÀÀaôo s XpuaaaïïLÔos | 3Àe(1&gt;aç itpòç oCxov (P/îo/wsâz/ 1372- 1373). In 379/378 B.C., Epameinondas, Gorgidas, and their friends, gathered Ttepí, to ttîs Arrivas uepóv , whence they were summoned to the agora, according to Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 34 (598C- D). Polyainos relates an anecdote in which Epameinondas, on the eve of the battle of Leuktra, caused the ßpexag of Athena to be altered in order to instil courage into the hearts of his men: this image apparently stood inside a temple (2.3. 12).4 Although none of these sources names the Athena as Onka, this seems to be the most likely identification, as the only independent Athena of whom we know at Thebes is Athena Onka. The two temples of Sophokles might refer to Athena Onka and Pronaia, the latter being the only other Athena attested at Thebes in the classical period.5 If we assume the identity of Athena Onka and the Athena(s) of Sophokles, Euripides, Plutarch, and Polyainos, there arises the question of how a temple of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. could become an open-air sanctuary in the second century A.D. We might suppose that the classical sanctuary was abandoned after 335 B.C., and that what Pausanias was shown was by way of being a tourist attraction.6 F. Vian, on the other hand, suggests that vao s / oí ko s are not to be taken literally, and that all there ever was was an enclosure by the Onkaian gate, with an altar, and a wooden cult image in a niche above the gate7 : this requires us to accept that Pausanias really saw a gate (he does not say he did), and that the sanctuary would have survived intact. 1. F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963) 1 39-140, regards a connection with the Arkadian Onkeion as certain, with Onchestos as possible. Two Theban coins may depict this Athena. On one, she is usually called Thebe, on the other Harmonia. "Harmonia" holds and gazes at a Korinthian helmet, "Thebe" holds an unidentified object in her right hand: E. Babelon, Traité des Monnaies Grecques et Romaines 2.3 (Paris 1914) 229/230.232 (= BMC Central Greece 72.41); 229/230.233 (= BMC Central Greece 12A2'NZeit9 [1877] 35.117). 2. F.

The scholiast to OT 20 informs us that Athena at Thebes was known as Onkaia and Ismenia, or as Alalkomeneia and Kadmeia. We can, as does the scholiast, delete Alalkomeneia, and we can also equate Ismenia with Pronaia, and Onkaia with Kadmeia. 4. It is easy to see how a real ßperaq - a wooden cult image - would be identified as a dedication by Kad mos. One would expect such a story to be told about an old cult image; compare the three wooden Aphrodites reputedly dedicated by Harmonia (Pausanias 9.16.3-4) - see APHRODITE (THEBES). 5. According to SchoL Euripides, Phoinissai 1062, the following was inscribed on the temple of Athena Onka: "O7 kclç vrjòç oô' €otù&gt; 'Aôtjvtjç ou nore KáS/Ltoç ei odro ßovv 6 ' le pe voe v ot* CKTiaev aorv to 017 ßr's. These are two hexameter lines, and may have come from an epic poem (?by Antimachos or Rhianos). 6. This is by and large the view of A.D. Keramopoullos, ADelt 3 (1917) 334-335. 7. F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1 963) 141. 131</page><page sequence="139">ATHENA (THEBES) B) Pronaia See, in general, APOLLO (THEBES) A. An inscription of the sixth century B.C. on a bronze vase, reported to have been found on the western slope t)f the hill identified as the Ismenion, records the following fragmentary dedication: - - v avenene Tot^ávau TÔtL npovauau: ADelt 3 (1917) 36.2. Sophokles, OT 20- 21, speaks of two temples of Athena at Thebes, and I have suggested above that he may be referring to Athena Onka and Athena Pronaia. Pausanias' description (9.10.2) is quite clear: there was no temple of Athena Pronaia, but only two statues called Pronaoi, a Hermes by Pheidias, and Athena by Skopas. This would date the statue to the fourth century B.C., possibly to the first third of the century, where we may place the rebuilding of the Ismenion. On Athena Ismenia, see above, p. 131 note 3ģ C) Other Epithets 1) Homolois Given to Athena by Lykophron , Alexandra 520, and see Schol Perhaps a mistake for Demeter or Zeus? See DEMETER (THEBES) and ZEUS (THEBES).

Unfortunately, the text is faulty. It reads ïï Ana ¿o v ôè ' AycpUTpiîcovoç ôuo áyaXyaxa Àu^Lva Àeyouauv ' AOnvãç cTtuHÁnauv ZwaTripćaę . There have been a variety of conjectures, the thrust of which is to make the two images dedications by Amphitryon. Perhaps the passage should remain obelized, but it may be possible to suggest another solution. The explanation which Pausanias gives of the two statues does not say anything that might imply that they were both statues of Athena. Perhaps the group was thought to be Amphitryon and Athena? Compare IG 7.548, from Tanagra, a boundary stone(?) of a sanctuary of Zeus Machaneus (?) and Athena Zosteiria. A solution of this sort, that it was a double statue of a god and goddess appropriate to an agora, misinterpreted by a later generation, might be considered. The epithet of Athena would have led to the aition, its location giving plausibility to the connection with Amphitryon (his last adventure was against the Euboians).

This monument was dedicated in the Herakleion at Thebes. Obviously, Herakles here symbolizes Thebes, and Athena Athens. ADelt 3 (1917) 315 seems to be an inscription of the goddess' name, found south of the Kadmeia; ADelt 19 (1964 [1966] ) B '.2.194, is a small marble headless Athena, near which was found a marble female head, both early Roman, both from the Kadmeia.

The founder of the cult is Eteokles or Eteoklos, called by some a son of Kephisos.3 Pausanias tells us that the sanctuary of the Charités was the oldest one at Orchomenos; recent excavation in the area east of the theatre and south of the Mycenaean palace has revealed foundations that have been identified as the pronaos of the temple of the Charités.4 The cult is undoubtedly an old one, and the connection between goddesses and town is as close in men's minds (since Pindar at any rate) as that between the Muses and Helikon.5 The fact is, however, that we know nothing about the worship of the Charités, except for a reference in Ephoros to gifts - the context suggests they were first fruits - sent to the goddesses, and, of course, the agon, on which see below. Päusanias says that the most highly venerated cult objects at Orchomenos were unwrought stones, said to have fallen from the sky to Eteokles (9.38.1 : the new cult images he calls ra . . . aùv xóaya) ïïgïïo uriyeva ) . Similar stones were worshipped as Eros in Thespiai and Herakles in Hyettos; they are primitive, but not necessarily ancient. See EROS (THESPIAI), and HERAKLES (HYETTOS). There was a revival of interest in the cult in the second half of the second century A.D., probably because of the influence of literary references to the Charités. This new interest is seen in the new cult images to which Pausanias refers, and in the dedication of images of the Charités in the same period at the Itoneion, the "national" sanctuary. 1.

The victors' lists, IG 7.3195, 3196, and 3197, have been subjected to a great deal of scholarly attention; a recent attempt at dating them - most scholars are content with a vague ca. 100-75 B.C. or s.la - has produced the sequence IG 7.3195-3196-3197, and placed them within a decade reaching from the mid- seventies to the mid-sixties of the first century B.C.2 I am not certain about the sequence: IG 7.3197 has two victors in it who appear at Delphi in 105 and 97 B.C., and I should think that a date earlier than the seventies is possible, if not in fact required. My own inclination is to date all three in the period ca. 90-70 B.C.,3 with IG 7.3197 perhaps as the first (in addition to the two victors I have mentioned, there is one other factor which might suggest an earlier rather than later date: this list is by far the longest of the three, and the comparatively large number of competitions in it may be significant of a period of relative prosperity, that is, a period before rather than after the Mithridatic war). The attempt in IG 7.3195 to imitate the moribund Boiotian dialect might, in turn, better suit a period nearer the middle of the first century B.C., when, as we see from the Pamboiotia, there seems to have been a revival of "patriotic" feeling. See ATHENA (KORONEIA). IG 7.3196 and 3197 both contain ^ictors in the Charitesia, followed by a shorter list of victors in tov veynTOV àyuòva tojv ' OyoXajuojv . The list in each case ends with the epinikia, the overall winner: in IG 7.3196, it is Ergeas son of Ergeas, victorious aulete in the Charitesia and men's and boys' aulete in the Homoloia; in IG 7.3197 it is the comic poet Alexandros son of Ariston, victorious in the Charitesia. From this, we can deduce that the overall winner was chosen from among the victors in both agons, and that the two agons were, if not contemporary, at least consecutive: they must have taken place within a day or so of each other, in order for our first deduction to apply. Furthermore, the presence of the same foreigners as victors in both agons must mean that there was no great interval between the two. IG 7.3195, as I have noted, gives the victors from the Charitesia only. However, the epinikios is the komoidos Euarchos son of Herodotos, who is not the same person as the victorious komoidos in the Charitesia (Nikostratos son of Philostratos). Those who have noticed this have used it to support the theory that the epinikios/epinikia is a separate, final competition, involving all the victors competing for an overall prize.4 However, if we set IG 7.3195 in its context - that is, as one of a series with 3196 and 3197 - 1.

Snell, TGrF 1 ,DID.A.10. 3 All three lists have victors who appear on three ot the lists of the Amphiaraia and Romaia at Oropos. This agon was founded under this title soon after 86 B.C., and - as I see it - was reorganized after the town of Oropos' successful appeal in 73 B.C. to the Senate for tax relief, to include as a final competition, the EvayyeXia rf?ç *Pu&gt;/u cll'ljv vikw. see AMPHIARAOS JOROPOS) p. 25 note 2. One of the victors' lists from Oropos with this competition {IG 7.415 and 417) shares a victor with IG 7.3195; if IG 7.415 and 417 post-dates 73 B.C., then/&lt;7 7.3195 might be the second or third in the Örchoinenian series, not the first. 4. J. Frei, De Certaminibus Thymelicis (Basel 1900) 42, see '&lt;ś Mie, AM 34 (1909) 17. Frei (p. 42) taxes emviKioç as qualifying hyojv . Mie (p. 16) prefers v/ivoq (with, for example, fanara, vé'r¡ for ein vinta). I am not sure that this is correct, but perhaps this is because I find it difficult to envisage a single competition embracing a variety of artistic categories. For example, in the agonothete's apologia of the Sarapieia at Tanagra - IG 7.540: see RA (1966) 297-332 and SKG 19.335 - a first and second prize in the epinikios are given to the artists previously victorious as tragic poet and kitharist respectively. It seems to me more logical to take epinikios/epinikia as referring, not to a separate final competiton, but rather to a final global assessment of the overall quality of the individual victors. However, the logical answer is neither always nor necessarily the right one. See M. Calvet and P. Roesch, RA (1966) 320. 142</page><page sequence="150">CHARITES (ORCHOMENOS) a different explanation presents itself, namely that the agon in which Euarchos won the prize which qualified him for the epinikia was not the Charitesia, but the Homoloia. So, on my reading of the evidence, all three inscriptions deal, not only with the Charitesia, but with the Homoloia as well. There are two more problems concerning the Homoloia, first, the meaning ofveyriTÓç, and second, the identity of the deity in whose honour the Homoloia were celebrated. For the first there is no satisfactory explanation. E. Laroche defines v e y n to s oty^v as "un concours tiré au sort", an interpretation rejected by J. and L. Robert on the sound grounds that our inscriptions do not refer to a xArípos.l A. Wilhelm deals with IG 7.3196 and 3197 after a discussion of the veynaLs ûïïOHpUTÔvat Athens, and concludes that "gewiss liegt dem Ausdruck eine v i y n o u s zugrunde , wie sie für die athenische Schauspieler bezeugt ist: der Anmeldung der Teilnahme und einer Prüfung ihrer Leistungen und ihrer Vorbereitung folgte die Zuweisung, die Bestellung für einem bestimmten Agon".2 I think that perhaps the nearest we can get to an explanation of veynxòç âyoSv is that it signifies an agon, competition in which was somehow restricted. The restriction may have involved proficiency (in IG 7.3196, five of the six competitions in the Homoloia were won by three people previously victorious in the Charitesia; in 3197, there are three) and/or the type of competition: in the Homoloia these are for man and boy aulete, man and boy hegemon, tragoidos, and komoidos. Perhaps the Homoloia were limited to representations of old, as opposed to modern, plays.3 With regard to the deity in whose honour the Homoloia were celebrated, P. Amandry and T.G. Spyropoulos, in their study of the choregic tripod dedications to Dionysos - see DIONYSOS (ORCHOMENOS) - astutely noticed that "l'emploi constant dans les dédicaces de trépieds â Dionysos, au lile siècle, de la formule avôpeaau x°PaY£¿aaVTe£ vuHaaavTeçet la mention non moins constant du nom du flûtiste et du nom du chef du choeur imposent le rapprochement entre ces consécrations et le programme des Homoloia, tel qu'il nous est connu pour le 1er siècle av. J.-C.".4 They wonder if the divinity who carries the epithet Homoloios was not in fact Dionysos, even though the connection is not attested. I think it is quite possible that the Homoloia of the first century B.C. were descended from the same festival which gave rise to the choregic monuments of the hellenistic period at Orchomenos. However, I do not think that it is really necessary to postulate a *Dionysos Homoloios. The very profusion of gods for whom Homoloios (otherwise not attested) is given as an epithet in Boiotia and/or Thebes, suggests that scholars of late antiquity knew nothing about the identity of the god for whom the Homoloia were celebrated (a similar confusion arose between the Herakleia at Thebes and the Iolaeion, the place where they were celebrated, resulting in the invention of a non-existent agon, the Iolaeia). A possible answer is that the name Homoloia refers not to an epithet or deity, but simply to the Boiotian month Homoloios (May/June: the same month in which the musical and dramatic Sárapieia were celebrated at Tanagra). If this is so, then the "restricted" agon held immediately after the Charitesia was called Homoloia after the month in which it was held, in order to distinguish it from the regular, "open", Charitesia. 1.

Ghiron-Bistagne (cited above, p. 142 note 2) 123, on the use of tragoidos/komoidos for protagonists or producers of old plays. Although IG 7.3195 and 3196 list, for the Charitesia, only tragoidos and komoidos in addition to the thymelic competitions, 3197 has, in addition to these, competitions for satyr poets, tragic poets, comic poets, and actors in all three categories, so perhaps my point about the Homoloia is valid. 4. BCH 98 (1974) 228. 143</page><page sequence="151">CHARITES (ORCHOMENOS) This explanation might also account for the athletic Homoloia (an agon stephanites) in which a boxer of late in the second or early in the first century B.C. was victorious {IG 7.48). That there was an athletic side to the Charitesia is known from IG 2^.3160, of Athens, dated second or first century B.C. by J. and L. Robert1 : here, a victory in the competition ïïauôaç axaôuov is recorded in the agon stephanites Xap u I Tnaua | Ta év ' Op | xoy evu) . Perhaps these two athletic agons were really one, or at least consecutive. It is interesting to find the Charités celebrated by athletic competitions as well as by musical and dramatic ones. We know nothing about the relationship between the two parts of the festival. If they were celebrated simultaneously, the victors were listed on different stones. The musical and dramatic Charitesia and the dramatic Homoloia must have been celebrated in the theatre, where one or more inscriptions relating to the Charitesia are said to have been found: BCH 98 (1974) 224. The theatre, of course, was sacred to Dionysos (who, according to Servius, on Vergil, Aeneid 1.720, was father of the Charités), and must have been near the sanctuary of the Charités (see Pausanias 9.38.1 , who mentions Dionysos and the Charités in the same sentence; is the text sound?).2 Amandry's and Spyropoulos' theory that the choregic monuments dedicated to Dionysos may actually have been connected with the Homoloia becomes more attractive if we identify the Homoloia as an adjunct of the Charitesia, and it may find support in the bronze coins of Orchomenos, which I have elsewhere suggested commemorate the Charitesia: on the reverse is a tripod encircled by a wreath, signifying, one assumes, an agon stephanites and the choregic monuments.3 See DIONYSOS (ORCHOMENOS) and HOMOLOIA (ORCHOMENOS). 1.

Jamot, suggested -BCH 19 (1895) 377 - that these daimones were really Phoenician spirits who were associated with the prehellenic Phoenician baityl later called Eros. 1 think that the solution may be a little less spectacular. There are several clues: first, this is an official dedication by a part of the civic government; second, the hierarchs are identified not only by name, but also by date (they are the hierarchs in office in the archonship of Hippon): the stone may therefore record an annual rite (although this does not necessarily follow); third, the hierarchs are accompanied by a herald: there must therefore have been a public gathering if not a procession.

Although it is tempting to associate Demeter and her daughter with the Kabeiroi here, as at the Theban Kabirion.1 we must reserve judgement.

Thouria brings to mind Apollo Thourios of Mt Thourion near Chaironeia. The cult complex there includes a nymph variously named Thouro or Thero, mother of Chairon. Perhaps Demeter Thouria is this nymph in still another guise. See my article in BICS 14 (1967) 6, and APOLLO (CHAIRONEIA).

Sophokles, OK 91) Lysimachos is quoted by the Scholiast on OK 91 as quoting one Arizelos (on whom see F. Jacoby ad loc.)'. the story concerns the burial of Oidipous, who had died at Thebes. His friends, being unable to bury him there, took him to a place in Boiotia called Keos. When misfortunes befell the latter, they were compelled to disinter the body, which they brought to Eteonos, where they buried it under cover of night, unaware that they were doing so in a sanctuary of Demeter. The inhabitants of Eteonos consulted the oracle,2 which bade them not disturb the goddess' suppliant. The sanctuary was then named Oidipodeion. C. Robert suggested that this sanctuary was the. original centre of a cult of Oidipous.5 1. B. Hemberg, Die Kabiren (Uppsala 1950) 1 37, does so, and in fact goes further: he suggests that Pausanias' description of Demeter's daughter as "pais" is significant since the male partner of Kabiros at the Kabirion was called Pais.

The sanctuary was named after the hero. This recalls the Menelaion at Therapnai, where a goddess and hero - there called Helen and Menelaos - received joint worship.2 In Boiotia, the nearest parallels are the sanctuaries of Artemis Eukleia at Plataia (tomb of Euchidas) and Thebes (tombs of Alkis and Androkleia): see ARTEMIS (PLATAIA) and (THEBES).

The location of Eteonos is not fixed. See R. Hope Simpson and J.F. Lazenby, The Catalogue of the Ships in Homer's Iliad (Oxford 1970) 21, for a summary of the evidence. 2. See, for example, M.P.

Note in the region of Plataia, the heröon of Androkrates and the tomb of Leitos, which may have been near the sanctuary of Demeter at Hysiai. See ANDROKRATES (PLATAIA), DEMETER (PLATAIA), LEITOS (PLATAIA). 152</page><page sequence="160">DEMETER (near HYSIAI) Hysiai itself is identified by Pritchett with the Päntanassa ridge. In Pausanias' day Hysiai was in ruins: he reports that in its ruins were a half-finished (that is, derelict) temple of Apollo and a sacred spring, with mantic power (9.2.1): see APOLLO (HYSIAI). Later, at the end of his description of Plataia, Pausanias writes (9.4.3): e QTL ôe xau Anyrixpoç éituxÀriauv 'EÀeuauvuas uepòv êv IUaxauaCç nau ArļOTOU y vñya . Then he describes the spring Gargaphia, and after that is on the road from Plataia to Thebes. We might be justified in believing that the passage 9.4.3 refers to places within the territory of Plataia, rather than inside the city itself. If this is so, then the sanctuary of Demeter Eleusinia could be the same as that in Herodotos. Päusanias need not have seen it himself, nor need the tomb of Leitos have been anywhere near it. It is, in fact, a list of three points of antiquarian interest, not geographically pinpointed. The sanctuary of Demeter Eleusinia turns up also in Plutarch's account of the battle. He is the only one to associate it specifically with Hysiai: TÔ3V 'Yaucov ïïàtîcjÙov Ûïïo xòv Ku^aupûva vaos êax uv ápxauoç navu Anynxpoç 'EÀeuauvuas xat, Kópns Tipoaayopeuóyevoç : Aristeides 11.6 (325E). He also places the heroon and grove of Androkrates near it. According to Herodotos (9.25.3), Androkrates' shrine was near Gargaphia. It is Pritchett's view that Plutarch was right about the sanctuary of Demeter, but wrong about the heroon of Androkrates. Clearly one must give precedence in this case to Herodotos: in Plutarch's day, the Plataiid was probably as depressed as it was later on in Pausanias', and he had to depend on other literary sources, and/or the opinions of local antiquarians, neither of which inspires much confidence by comparison with Herodotos. Herodotos locates the sanctuary of Demeter Eleusinia at a place called Argiopion, near the river Moloeis (9.57.2). Elsewhere (9.65.2) he refers to an aXoos and a xeyevos of the goddess. Plutarch gives a more complicated story. In response to a request by Aristeides, the Delphic oracle instructed the Greeks to pray and sacrifice to numerous deities, tòv huvòuvov êv yã uôua ïïououyevous êv xíp ti e ô u$) xãç Aayaxpoç xãs 'EAeuauvuas xaì, xãs Kopaç: Aristeides 1 1.3 (325 C).1 According to Plutarch, the oracle was explained to the Plataian general Arimnestos in a dream, in which he was instructed to search in the Plataiid for all the places mentioned. On waking, Arimnestos consulted the most experienced and oldest of his fellow citizens, with whose help he discovered that near Hysiai there was an old temple called that of Demeter Eleusinia and Kore: Aristeides 1 1.5-6 (325D- E). Nearby, as I have noted, Plutarch, Aristeides 1 1 .7 (325 E-F), placed the heroon of Androkrates. The inscriptions record two dedications to Demeter (no epithet survives). IG 7.1671 reads avedeuav xaë Aáyaxpu } IG 7.1670 is part of the dedication, in verse, of a cult image to Demeter, and might possibly include among the dedicators the seer Teisamenos.3 Both seem to belong to early in the fifth century B.C. 1. This response is listed by H.W. Parke and D.E.W. Wormell, The Delphic Oracle 2 (Oxford 1956) 45.102, among those of the "Third Period", i.e. up to 479 B.C. See 1.1 74 ff., for their interpretation of the oracle, which they regard as "certainly historical", but "somewhat misrepresented by a later narrative designed to show that it was a perfect prophecy of Plataea". J. Fontenrose, The Delphic Oracle (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London 1 978) 319Q154, lists it among "Quasi-historical responses" as being "partly genuine" (p. 320: "The direction to worship the named gods and heroes is probably genuine. The final direction to fight on the plain of Demeter Eleusinia and Kore looks like a post eventum addition"). 2. The dialect is Boiotian.

That a sanctuary of Demeter existed before the battle seems to be clear enough from the presence of the grove and temenos mentioned by Herodotos. What is less clear is whether this Demeter was surnamed Eleusinia before the battle, or only after it, in honour of the great goddess of Attika. The result of this is that we know nothing about the nature of the cult. The sanctuary seems, in any event, to have fallen into disuse long before Plutarch, and certainly before Pausanias' visit to Plataia; it is striking, in fact, that contemporary cult evidence in the form of inscriptions and literary references, not to speak of architectural remains, is limited to a short period within the fifth century B.C. The conclusion must be that the fortunes of the sanctuary waned with those of the town.1 See ANDROKRATES (PLATAIA), DEMETER (PLATAIA), HERA (PLATAIA), HEROES ARCHEGETAI (PLATAIA), LEITOS (PLATAIA).

Note that on p. 314.R12, the inscription is misquoted. Coins: the link with the coins was suggested by E.S.G.

Damatra as a human name is found in Tanagra (IG 7.885); Tauropolos is unattested. Pausanias lists three sanctuaries at Kopai, of which one belongs to Demeter. DEMETER (KORONEIA) Epithets: Krisaia Epidamos Thesmophoros Festival: Thesmophoria IG 7.2876; 3213 IG 7.2876 (in dialect) records the repair by a former priestess of a prothyron and the dedication of an amphithiourion for Demeter Thesmophoros. We can assume that there was a temple, and there must also have been Thesmophoria. IG 7.3213 is grouped among the inscriptions of Orchomenos. It comes from Deglesi (Mavrogeia), which is between Koroneia and Orchomenos. At Ayios Demetrios (north of Deglesi, i.e. farther still from Koroneia) is the stone with IG 7.2870, beyond any doubt a Koroneian inscription. A Koroneian origin for IG 7.3213 is therefore not impossible. The inscription reads Eauy e ÚÀa IIo'î^a)vos Aayaxepu | Kpuanrļ èïïuôayo àvedeuxe. The combination of epithets is interesting: I take it to mean "the Demeter from Krisa who sojourns amongst us".1 Krisaia seems to be a straightforward geographical appellation. For Epidamos - or rather Epidemos - LSft sv èïïuônyos suggests, as one meaning, "sojourning in a place", and sv è% uônyuos "sojourning among". In an inscription from Rhodes we find eituôay úa , "right of residence" (IG 12.1.43, see LSfî sv), and from the same island the auv^uxau 'PoôuaaxaL éuuôayuaaTau (IG 12.1.157; F. Poland, Geschichte des Griechischen Vereinswesens [Leipzig 1909] 565B268), of whom J. and L. Robert write, "ce sont des étrangers qui ont eu le privilège de l'éïïuôay ua " (Bull épigr. 65.272). The inscription would therefore seem to be a dedication to a goddess whose cult was established in Koroneia or Orchomenos either by a Krisaian (or Krisaians) or in deference to a Krisaian (or Krisa). This could have happened any- where, of course, but it is even more likely at a federal sanctuary, namely the Itoneion at Koroneia, which is why I prefer to assign the inscription to Koroneia.2 It still remains to be discovered if Demeter was worshipped at Krisa/Kirrha. 1. O. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie und Religiongeschichte 2 (Munich 1906) 1 166 note 1 3, suggests a possible connection with Themis. L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States 3 (Oxford 1907) 323.R56, groups the inscription among "Political and ethnic titles and cults" (see also p. 68). 2. See IG 92.1 .1 70, a treaty between the Boiotians and the Aitolians and Phokians, a copy of which was to be set up at Koroneia. Perhaps the Demeter of IG 7.321 3 was brought to Koroneia as one result of a treaty of this kind, although no formal pretext is required. 155</page><page sequence="163">DEMETER (7KYRT0NES) - DEMETER (LEBADEIA) DEMETER (7KYRT0NES) With Kore IG 9.1.287 The inscription, which comes from Kolaka, which may have been the site of Kyrtones,1 records the dedication to Demeter and Kore of the statue of a former priestess. DEMETER (LEBADEIA) Epithets: Europe ?Herkyn(n)a ?Festival: Herkynia With Kore Hesy chios sv ' E p x úv u a Lykophron, A lexandra 153 Päusanias 9.39.2-3; 9.39.4-5 Schol Lykophron, Alexandra 153 Demeter at Lebadeia was, according to our sources - which are late - one of the deities associated with the Trophoneion. However, she was not a part of the central cult complex, which, if I am correct, included only Trophonios and the nymph Herkyna: see BICS 14 (1967) 6-7. Demeter is attached to the oracular cult through both Herkyna and Trophonios as follows: Herkyna: a cult of Demeter was founded by Herkyna, daughter of Trophonios, and named by her after herself. So says the Scholiast on Lykophron, Alexandra 153, in explanation of the epithet (which varies with the manuscripts between "Epxuv [a] and "Epxuvv [a] ). According to Pausanias (9.39.2-3) Herkyna, holding a goose, was playing with Kore; the goose escaped and hid beneath a stone, where Kore found it; water flowed forth from beneath this stone and thereafter the river was called Herkyna. Kore reappears at Pausanias 9.39.4, where he mentions Kopns . . . xaÀouyevri tdnpa (see the apparatus criticus in Hitzig's text), a place situated somewhere between the oracle of Trophonios and the temple of Zeus Basileus. Finally, there is Hesy chios, sv Epxrivua, which is altered to 'Epxúvua' èopTn AnyriTpog. Trophonios: within the Trophoneion was a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Europe (Pausanias 9.39.4). The consultant of Trophonios offered preliminary sacrifices to numerous deities, including this Demeter, who was said to be the nurse of Trophonios (Pausanias 9ģ39.5). The epithet Europe is remarkable (Pausanias seems to have thought so too), but Europe does have a strong Boiotian pedigree, and it is not really surprising to find the name at the Trophoneion, which seems, like many well-known sanctuaries, to have attracted numerous other deities to it in minor roles. In the case of the Trophoneion, Boiotian figures, like Europe and Arkesilaos (Pausanias 9.39.3) were popular. Europe herself is localized within Boiotia in the areas of Thebes and the western part of the Kopais.2 Perhaps the identification of Trophonios with Zeus helped to ease the absorption of Europe into the greater cult complex. 1.

What is interesting is that the local tradition of Herkyna was so strong that she was never entirely displaced by the panhellenic goddess; this is similar to what happened with Trophonios: while at other oracular sanctuaries the local hero is usually reduced to the state of epithet of Apollo, here Trophonios was too strongly entrenched to succumb, and the most that could be done was to make him a son of Apollo. In the case of Herkyna, the only evidence for her name as an epithet of Demeter is Lykophron. I think that one must reserve judgement on whether or not Herkyna was ever actually confused with Demeter to the extent of giving her name to the latter. As far as the festival is concerned, the evidence - given the manuscript problem, and the fact that Hesychios does not localize the affair - is clear enough, but only for a festival called Herkynia, not necessarily for a festival of Demeter.

From Päusanias, then, we can deduce with certainty that the sanctuary contained a cult image, that it was open daily (having Herakles as neokoros might have meant, in practical terms, no more than an admission that the sanctuary was not in possession of a regular priesthood and attendant officials, but was, in fact, only a small rural shrine), and that the goddess' worshippers were in the habit of offering parts of their crops to her (the "miracle" of the persistent freshness could be tested only if we knew what time of year Pausanias called at Mykalessos). 157</page><page sequence="165">DEMETER (MYKALESSOS) - DEMETER (PLATAIA) Since Pausanias' informants were presumably local farmers (the town itself was in ruins: Pausanias 9.19.4; the sanctuary lay somewhere beyond it), or at best local antiquarians from Aulis or Tanagra, we cannot assume that the information they gave to Pausanias has any validity of any sort, or that the cult of Demeter Mykalessia (the epithet must be purely local) was associated with that of Demeter (or Deo) Gephyraia, as F. Vian suggests, or that the grouping of Herakles Idaios with Demeter is to be compared with Herakles and Demeter at Thespiai (on a relief of hellenistic date) and that this cult was originally prehellenic, as M. Launey suggests, or that Herakles Idaios and Demeter are to be compared with similar pairs at Elis (not a pair, actually, but part of a larger group) and Megalopolis, as B. Hemberg suggests.3 For the record, it should be noted that a group of vases originally attributed to a harvest festival at Mykalessos were subsequently determined to be Korinthian and not relevant to this cult.2 Three inscriptions have been linked with this sanctuary, but only on the most tenuous grounds.3 DEMETER (ORCHOMENOS) See DEMETER (KORONEIA).

There is, in fact, no compelling reason to associate this agon with Demeter. I have already indicated my scepticism about the value of the evidence which Pausanias transmits (we can accept that he writes in good faith, but need not accord the same degree of credibility to his sources). There is one other knowr: candidate at or near Mykalessos, namely Hermes - see HERMES (MYKALESSOS) - but neither he nor Demeter nor indeed any specific deity need have been involved. See UNSPECIFIED (MYKALESSOS). 158</page><page sequence="166">DEMETER (PLAT AIA) - DEMETER (POTNIAI) I have suggested that the sanctuary of Demeter Eleusinia at Plataia which Pausanias mentions may have been identical with the sanctuary which figured in the battle of Plataia: see DEMETER (near HYSIAI). Although this may be so, it does not follow that there was not an urban "branch" sanctuary within the city walls. E. Kirsten suggested that a sanctuary site excavated by A.N. Skias in the north-east corner of the town was that of Demeter Eleusinia, but there is no compelling reason for the identification.1 The inscription is a list of votive offerings by women;2 the editor, R.B. Richardson, assigned it to Demeter. There are other possibilities: see the Index of Inscriptions. According to the author of the Historia Alexandři Magni , Alexander visited the temenos of Kore at Plataia, and the priestess foretold great things for him; I do not know what, if anything, to make of this. DEMETER (POTNIAI) Epithet: Potniai/Potniades (Achaia/Thesmophoros) With Kore Rite: ?Thesmophoria Pausanias 9.8.1 Päusanias* text is obviously defective at two critical points. What he appears to say is that in the ruins of Potniai there was a grove of Demeter and Kore. The cult images were near the river, and people called them IÎOTVuaç or IIoTVuaôas $eaç • At a fixed time they performed rituals, including the casting of new-born pigs into so-called megara. These pigs, they said, (?reappeared) next year at the same time in Dodona, a statement which Pausanias treats with commendable scepticism.3 Whether the epithet of the goddesses was Potniai or Potniades or nothing at all, the fact that the town was called Potniai suggests that the cult was an old one of some importance. The place name at least is known from the fifth century on (see the story of Glaukos Potnieus), and the cult must have been at least that old: indeed, there are reasonable grounds to believe that it may have existed during the Mycenaean period.4 1. RE 20 (1 950) sv "Plataia" 2280; 2312; 2325. Kirsten based this on the discovery of a fragmentary relief with torches. In fact, the sketch published by Skias shows two hands, each holding on to what looks like a staff or sceptre, rather than a torch. Skias, Praktika (1 899 [ 1 900] ) 49 note 1, suggested tentatively that the deities worshipped at this sanctuary may have been healing ones, because he had discovered a number of small bronze tools, which may have been surgical. Later, in AE (1917) 157, he settled for a sanctuary of "the gods", on the basis of the two inscriptions found there. However, the dedication of a statue rotç ôeoîk is, to say the least, banal. The first of these inscriptions - AE (1917) 157.1 - records a dedication [rot] ç (0e)o&amp;, by a woman who had [ßou] Qvrr'oaoa (the restorations are by Skias); the second - AE (1917) 158.2, re-published by A.D. Keramopoullos, AE (1934/1935) AX 15.179, as an unpublished inscription - is the dedication of the bronze statues of two men to "the gods". 2. It may be worth noting that the names of the women include at least three - Tlapa ¡¿ova, Eoßapov, Zvpa - which are commonly held by slaves. 3. The manuscripts read rà Ôe hyäXßara hiri/hv tĢ irorapfy tÇ&gt; -rrapà ràç îlorviàç deàq òvonáÇovow. UorvíáSaq has been suggested as an addition after or replacement for TlorviÁs: see Hitzig 's apparatus criticus. The corruption may be rather more complicated, and perhaps longer than is generally realized. I would guess that n otvulç, for example, may have appeared twice in the sentence, the first time referring to the place, the second to the epithet, and that a copyist skipped from the first to the second, omitting a description of the cult images, and a linking passage between them and the epithet. Further on in the same paragraph the crucial infinitive is missing which would have told us what was supposed to have happened to the piglets at Dodona. That it was something outlandish is clear from Pausanias' sceptical ůXXoq nov Tiç neiadrioerai. 4. In the Theban Linear B tablet Of 36, an allotment of wool is destined for "po-ti-ni-ja wo-ko-de /PotnSs woikon-de/ "to the house (temple) of Potnia". J. Chadwick, in T.G. Spyropoulos and J. Chadwick, The Thebes Tablets II = Minos Supplement 4 (1975) 89, suggests that "the 'House of Potnia* may well have been at the place just south of Thebes known in classical times as Uotvlül (i.e. Demeter and Kore)". See M. Rocchi, "Po-ti-ni-ja e Demeter Thesmophoros a Tebe", Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici 19 = Incunabula Graeca 68 (Rome 1978) 63-67, esp. 63-65. 159</page><page sequence="167">DEMETER (POTNIAI) - DEMETER (SKOLOS) The rite itself, a kind of fertility magic, is similar to that practised elsewhere under the name of Thesmophoria,1 and it is difficult not to imagine an early connection between the cult at Potniai and that of Demeter Thesmophoria on the Kadmeia.2 The megara at Potniai also call to mind Plutarch's xemark, De Iside et Osiride 69(378D- E), that xat Bolcotou ra xr¡s 'Axauãç yeyapa xuvouatv. The Potnian cult, and by extension the Theban one, must be grouped together with the cults of Demeter Achaia, an epithet fairly widespread in Boiotia: see DEMETER (TANAGRA), (THESPIAI), (THISBE), (UNSPECIFIED). Even though we may, with Päusanias, be sceptical about the miraculous reappearance of the piglets at Dodona, this tradition is important, because it is one of several linking Boiotia, and especially Boiotian sanctuaries, with Dodona^: see KABIROI (TCABIRION), TRIPODOPHORIA (UNSPECIFIED). This connection may have originated at a time when the ancestors of the Boiotoi lived in or passed through the area. DEMETER (SKOLOS) Epithets: Megalartos and Megalomazos With Kore Eustathios, on Homer , Iliad 2.497 (p. 265.29) Päusanias 9.4.4 Polemon, F#G 3 p.l26F39 (Athenaios 10 [41 6b] ; 3 [109a]);p.l36F74(Athenaios 3 [109a]) The epithets are given by Eustathios and Polemon. It is clear that, although they are both attributed to Demeter, they apply to the same pair of goddesses - or rather, to the same bi-form goddess - whom Pausanias calls Demeter and Kore. The epithets have to do with grain and their produce.4 P. Guillon's interpretation of the Pausanias passage, retaining ny uaea for the usually accepted emendation to iły uepya by Schubart, seems right to me: Pausanias was describing a sanctuary which consisted of an open-air enclosure, with, as cult images, two statues depicting the upper parts of the goddesses, emerging, as it were, from the earth.5 1. See, for example, M.P. Nilsson, Griechische Feste (Leipzig 1906) 313; 321 ; 474; GGR 1 (Munich 1955) 119 and 463; A.D. Ķeramo poullos, ADelt 3 (1917) 353 note 4; M. Rocchi (cited above, p. 159 note 4) 64 and note 6. 2. See M. Rocchi (cited above, p. 159 note 4) 64-65. The connection would have been ancient history by the classical period, when the Theban Thesmophoria were celebrated on the Kadmeia: Xenophon, Hellenika 5.2.29; Plutarch, Pelopidas 5 (280C). But by this time, Demeter had for years been venerated as the state's chief akropolitan goddess: see DEMETER (THEBES). 3. The various connections are explored by D. Evangelidis and S.I.

It is mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue {Iliad 2.497), and usually located near Darimari (Daphni).1 There is, however, another school of thought, whose arguments I find convincing, which would locate Skolos near Neochoraki, just north of the Asopos.2 It is not without interest that there has been found, near Neochoraki, a sanctuary which has not yet been satisfactorily identified. I refer to that of Meter, at Soros, just north of Neochoraki, and west of Moustaphades (Kallithea), which is usually given as its location in the literature. The site was excavated by P. Stamatakis in 18743: there were traces of a settlement, the sanctuary itself seeming to consist of two buildings, one about twice the size of the other. The finds include three inscriptions {IG 7.560-562), at least one of which (560) is imperial in date, and a number of votive reliefs (one of which goes back to the fourth quarter of the fifth century B.C.) and statuettes: all of the material is collected by A. Körte, AM 3 (1878) 388 ff., see METER (SOROS/MOUSTAPHADES). Many of the reliefs are fragmentary, and a number of the statuettes depict various deities, but several represent Demeter or Kore.4 Perhaps one of the two buildings which seem to have made up this sanctuary was devoted to Demeter and Kore, or Demeter Megalartos/Megalomazos. To be sure, Pausanias says quite clearly that Skolos was in ruins and that the sanctuary was among the ruins, while IG 7.560 at any rate is evidence for activity in the imperial period. However, this is not decisive, as the fact that Päusanias himself describes the sanctuary among the ruins suggests that it at any rate was still active although the town itself was abandoned (see Potniai, for example).

Previously Hekataios had identified the Gephyraioi as Tanagraians.1 Herodotos may have reached his conclusion after reading Hekataios,2 but this is not necessarily so. The passage in Herodotos is concerned with the background of the tyrannicides, who were Gephyraioi; he then goes on to a discussion of the Phoenicians who came to Greece with Kadmos, and to an account of the "Kadmeian Writing" he had seen at the Ismenion at Thebes. It is not impossible that Herodotos' source for identifying the Gephyraioi as Kadmeians, that is, Phoenicians, was Theban.3 In any case, the story as related by Herodotos and later sources is fairly consistent: the Gephyraioi were expelled from Tanagra and ended up in Attika, where they retained the right to continue worshipping Demeter Achaia.4 Unfortunately, there is no firm evidence from Tanagra that Demeter was worshipped there in historical times as Achaia, although there is evidence for a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore (see below), and Demeter Achaia was well-known in Boiotia.5 1 . On relations between Tanagra and Eretria, see, for example, U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Hermes 21 (1 886) 91-1 15 = Kleine Schriften 5.1 (Berlin 1937) 1-25. For the Gephyraioi, see note 3, and p. 163 note 1. 2. This, is, for example, the opinion of F. Jacoby, in his commentary on Hekataios, FGrH 1F1 1 8. 3. The background of the Gephyraioi is discussed by JJC. Davies, Athenian Propertied Families (Oxford 1971) 472-473. J. Boardman, 2?&amp;4 52 (1957) 27 note 158, suggests that the Gephyraioi may have come from Chalkis rather than Eretria. On p. 26 of the same article, Boardman states that "the 'Phoenicians' and Gephyraeans are rather those Greeks who had no doubt lived a while in the Near East and had returned to teach what they had learned there, including the alphabet". This is an attractive suggestion. On Kadmos the Phoenician, see E.T. Vermeule, in Studies Presented to George MA. Hanf mann (Mainz 1971) 183-184 and 186. 4. Still another source may link the Gephyraioi with Tanagra, via its best known landmark, the Kerykeion: Pausanias the Grammarian in Eustathios 408.4, on Homer, Iliad 3.222; see F.

I must also include here the gloss of Hesychios, which reads rpaua ' ïïoAls . yfi xaù Anynxnp 9 since presumably it belongs to this general area, although there is no supporting evidence.1 The inscription, published by Th. Reinach, in REG 12 (1899) 53- 1 15, is on two sides of a stele. Side A deals with the removal of a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore from its former location to a new site within the polis. For some reason, the original sanctuary had become unusable, and the city consulted Apollo2 about the proper place to build a new one; there were three possibilities: at the old site, at a place called xãs Euayepuas (line 6), or inside the city (one can assume, therefore, that the original sanctuary was probably outside the city proper, perhaps in an abandoned village - compare Potniai, and the tradition of a synoikismos of the surrounding villages into Tanagra - or in the countryside); the city fathers interpreted Apollo's response to mean that the sanctuary should be set up within the walls of the city proper. The rest of Side A is con- cerned with the fiscal arrangements: in order to find money for the sanctuary and the temple, donations will be accepted (up to a maximum of five drachmas each) from the women of the city, and the handling of the money and the other arrangements are entrusted to a commission of three. It ends with a list of donors to the sanctuary and the amount each contributed. Side B contains lists, in three archon years, of donations, mainly of clothing, by women to the sanctuary. The clothing given by one woman (lines 38-39) ends up in the possession of the priestess.3 Th. Reinach, commenting on line 43 of Side A (p. 89), suggested, but with great and commendable hesitation, that what looks like the dittograph [xã]s Aay[axpos?] &lt;xãç A[ayaxpos]&gt; might be read [xã] s Aay[axpos] xãç ' A[xauãs]. Other than this, there is nothing to link this cult with that of Demeter Achaia. It would appear that by the time of Pausaniás' visit to Tanagra, this sanctuary had ceased to function, for he does not mention it. 1. The connection is made by J.M. Fossey, Euphrosyne NS 4 (1970) 8 note 6; the article, entitled "The Identification of Graia", deals with various candidates for the site, settling on Dramesi (Blegen's "Hyria"). One might suggest, too, that, since the Gephyraioi seem to have had connections with both the eastern seaboard of Boiotia and that part of Euboia facing it, there may have been at least two places called "Graia", one in the Tanagraia, the other perhaps in in the vicinity of Eretria (see Stephanos Byzantios, sv rpaõr iróXiç 'Eperpiaç). It would not be the only example of duplication of place names. On the question of the Graians and Gephyraians and their relations with Euboia and Boiotia, see also, F. Focke, in Festschrift für Friedrich Zucker (Berlin 1954) 1 59- 160, an article entitled "Araber in Griechenland". 2. One thinks, as Th. Reinach did, of Apollo Ptoios: REG 1 2 (1 899) 82. See APOLLO (PTOION) p. 67 note 1 . 3. The date of this inscription is dealt with by D. Knoepfler, Chiron 7 (1977) 67-87, who concludes that Side B is the older of the two, and dates from about the first half of the third century B.C., with Side A being inscribed early in the second century. 163</page><page sequence="171">[DEMETER (TELPHOUSA)] [DEMETER (TELPHOUSA)] Epithet: Erinys Tilphossaia KaUimachos, fr. 652 Pf.

MV Homer, Iliad 23.346 Schol Sophokles, Antigone 126 The myth about the birth of the miraculous horse Areion is located both in Arkadia and in Boiotia. Areion's parents are Poseidon (in both places) and Demeter Erinys (Arkadia) or Erinys/Erinys Tilphosaia (Boiotia).1 It is impossible to determine which place, if either, had priority.2 Tilphosse Erinys is named, in Schol Sophokles, Antigone 126, as the mother, by Ares, of the dragon which Kadmos slew,3 and Lykophron, Alexandra 153, lists among three other epithets of Demeter in Boiotia, Erinys. I cannot unravel this to my satisfaction. Presumably there was thought to be a goddess, Erinys, connected with Tilphossion or Telphousa, and she was by some identified with Demeter. But whether this was a real Boiotian or Boiotian/Arkadian tradition, or only a literary invention based originally on a confusion between the Boiotian Telphousa and the Arkadian Thelpousa, I do not know. It bothers me that no Boiotian author - neither Hesiod nor Pindar nor Korinna nor Plutarch - and no other author who deals with Boiotian antiquities before Kallimachos and Lykophron, has a word to say about this.4 There is, in any case, no evidence for an actual cult of Erinys Tilphossaia or of Demeter as Erinys in Boiotia. 1. In "Kyklikoi", apud Schol MV Homer, Iliad 23.346, she is called Erinys; Kallimachos, fr. 652 Pf., calls her Erinys Tilphosaia (but see Pfeiffer 's note ¿ft/ loc.). Of course, the story of the horse need not have been originally tied either to Arkadia or to Boiotia: it may have been taken out of the epic tradition and attached to the myth of the horse god Poseidon and his consort (also presumably a horse). 2.

The proximity of the two sanctuaries is confirmed by Pindar, Isthmian 7.3-5, where Dionysos is called the paredros of Demeter at Thebes.1 Further confirmation, if it is needed, of the sanctuary's location on the Kadmeia, comes from Xenophon, Hellenika 5.2.29: the Spartans managed to get into the Kadmeia in 382 B.C. because the boule was meeting in the agora, while the women were celebrating Thesmophoria on the Kadmeia; see Plutarch, Pelopidas 5 (280B- C).2 1. xakKOKpÓTov irápeôpov ļ Aap árepoç . . .

Moreux, in an exhaustive article on the passage, REG 83 (1970) 1 -14, while admitting the topographical significance of irápeôpov , sees a religious connotation in the term (p. 4-5); on the basis of xoKkokpòtov (to which, p. 9, he denies any warlike significance), he suggests that the Demeter in this passage is not simply Demeter, but rather the Megale Meter of whom Pindar was an especial devotée, poetically addressed as Demeter. The whole case for a "special relationship" between Pindar and Meter rests on the assumption that at Pythian 3.77ff., Pindar is speaking propria voce ; all later references depend on this interpretation of the passage: Aristodemos, FGrH 383F13 (i Schol Pindar, Pythian 3.137b); Pausanias 9.25.3; Philostratos, Imagines 2.12.2-3; Vita Ambrosiana p. 2.5 Drachmann; Schol Pindar, Pythian 3.1 37a; 1 38; 1 39b. It seems, on the whole, to be a hellenistic scholarly invention. See W.J. Slater, "Pindar's House", GRBS 12 (1971) 141-152, and METER (THEBES). On Demeter and Dionysos, see P. Jamot, Mélanges Perrot (Paris 1903) 200-201. The relief Athens National Museum 1440, dated in the third quarter of the fourth century B.C., and depicting Dionysos and a female figure, might be seen as a representation of the Theban situation. The difficulty is that one cannot always be sure that artefacts at Thebes or said to have come from there really did originate in that city. Thebes houses the major collection of antiquities in Boiotia, and many items from outside Thebes eventually find their way there; in addition, there is the problem that artefacts which find their way onto the market often have unreliable provenances. On xo-^KOKpórov, see below. 2. It is also at this sanctuary that Pausanias (9.6.5-6) locates the omens before the battle of Leuktra and before the arrival of Alexander. The latter is mentioned also by Diodoros Siculus 17.10.2-4, without any topographical reference, and by Ailian, Variae Historiae 12.57, as occurring 'ev òè tí Jí mra iróMv pcÇj rrjç Ariprirpoq. The term icarà ttóXip here must mean "on the akropolis", i.e., the Kadmeia, and there is no reason to suppose that there was another sanctuary in the lower city. See L.

Päusanias then goes on: AnyriTpoç ôè ayaXya oaov è s aTepva éaTÙv èv tí¡&gt; cpavepq). This kind of cult image of Demeter, arising from the earth, to signify her function as a fertility goddess and her virtual identification with the earth, is found at Skolos too: see DEMETER (SKOLOS). This aspect of the Theban Demeter is emphasized by Euripides, who, in Phoinissai 685-686, identifies Demeter with Ge.1 Whether or not there was a temple, there must have been some kind of building in the sanctuary, at least a stoa, because we are told by Pausanias that there were bronze shields dedicated at the sanctuary, said to be Spartan booty from the battle of Leuktra: shields must be hung somewhere. The location of the sanctuary of what was basically a fertility goddess2 on the akropolis3 had interesting results. Demeter, and Kore in her train, became the chief protective goddess of the state. This combination of agricultural and political functions is nowhere more clearly expressed than in Euripides, Phoinissai 683-688: in the same passage in which Demeter is equated with Ge, she and Persephone, the goddesses of two names, are described as possessors of Thebes, the fire-bearing goddesses whose function it is to protect the land. The way in which Demeter and Kore are depicted on an Attic hydria of late in the fifth century B.C. (by the Kadmos painter), represents what was obviously the reality. Demeter is shown, enthroned on the Kadmeia, a crown on her head, a sceptre in her hand; near her is Kore.4 There is no doubt that the Demeter of Thebes was, in the words of Y. Béquignon, a "déesse acropolitaine".5 This aspect of the Theban Demeter might explain the epithet x^xoxpOTOU given to her by Pindar.6 It is only natural that the sanctuary of such a goddess should be the repository of the booty from the battle of Leuktra, and the site of the omens (real or not) which foretold success in 371 B.C. and doom in 335 (see above, p. 166 note 2). Demeter's importance to the prosperity of the state is also revealed in the sacrifice of a bull to the goddess and the taking of omens from the empyra. This took place, on the one occasion of which we know, at the end of the archon year, when the city's magistrates left office and new ones took their places. The sacrifice is mentioned casually, and I should think that it was a regular occurrence.7 1 . See IG 7.2452, and see GE (THEBES). See P.W. Hamdorf, Griechische K u lì perso nifi ka tio ne n der vorhellenistischen Zeit (Mainz 1 964) 4-5; F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1 963) 1 35 - 1 36. 2. This function is clear from the epithet Thesmophoros, the rites, the cult image, and the identification with Ge. 3. Perhaps, originally, as an "urban" branch ol the sanctuary at Potniai? See DEMETER (POTNIAI), and below, p. 168 note 2. 4. The vase depicts Kadmos v. the dragon, watched by a variety of deities, most labelled: Harmonia, Nike, Athena, Demeter and Kora, Theba, Poseidan, Hermas, Apellon, Artamis, and two unlabelled (one male, Ismenos? the other female, Aphrodite?). The names of some are given in non-Attic, perhaps Doric, perhaps Boiotian, forms. The scene may have been inspired by a specific piece of literature. 5. Y.

I do not follow Béquignon all the way, in finding akropolitan Demeters all over Boiotia. 6. F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963) 1 36 note 7, does not agree with this interpretation. It might, of course, be associated with the Thesmophoria. See above, p. 1 66 note 1 . 7. Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 17 (586F), compare 1 8 (5870- The event is mentioned because of the unfavourable omens, the sacrifice itself seems to be regarded as normal. For other riles at the end of the archon year, see APHRODITE (THEBES). 167</page><page sequence="175">DEMETER (THEBES) Theban coins of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. use Herakles, and to a lesser extent Dionysos, to personify the town, presumably because the mythological connections would make it easy at a glance to identify the coins as being Theban. Later on, the hellenistic koinon used both Poseidon (to represent the federal capital at Onchestos) and Demeter (I can only suppose, to represent Thebes as the dominant partner) on its coins.1 The preference of Demeter to Herakles or Dionysos is interesting: it does suggest to me that to the Thebans, Demeter was the goddess of the polis, and in a way represented Theban political aspirations. An interesting sidelight on this attitude is provided by the inscription SEG 17.396, of the fourth century B.C., found at Chios: AńynT po s | Bo uarran g (an attempt to reproduce the Boiotian dialect?). With this compare Diodoros Siculus 15.79.1 : in 364 B.C., the Thebans, in their efforts to increase their power at sea, ' Po 6 uous ôè xaì, Xiious xau Buçavxuous upOTpeuea^au ßon^ncau rats èli u ßoXau s . The inscription might have been a result of these negotiations and their aftermath; if so, its political significance is clear. The Thesmophoria are confirmed for the fourth century B.C. by Xenophon and Plutarch. The former notes that the Theban women celebrated this rite in mid-summer, an unusual time of year for Thesmophoria.2 The survival of the epithet Thesmophoros until the second century A.D. must mean that the festival continued to be celebrated. The two inscriptions probably belong to Demeter Thesmophoros: one (IG 7ģ2468), although fragmentary, has been restored plausibly enough as a dedication to Demeter and Kore. The other (IG 7.2676) is the tombstone of a priestess of Demeter (the stone contains an engraving of the priestess' key: evidence for a temple?). Of the epithets, only Thesmophoros can be confirmed. Homoloia (in Photios and Suidas) is less certain: it might belong to the Thessalian Thebes. Finally, notice may be taken of the epithet Xiphephoros, in Lykophron, Alexandra 153. The Scholia call this an epithet of Demeter in Boiotia. It might belong to the Theban Demeter, in her warlike capacity. See DEMETER (UNSPECIFIED). 1. Two silver coins of Thebes, dated ca. 446-426 B.C., depict on their reverse, a female figure seated on a low rock, and another seated on a chair and holding a helmet. They have been tentatively named Thebe and Harmonia respectively. "Thebe": E. Babelon, Traité des Monnaies Grecques et Romaines 2.3 (Paris 1914) 229/230.232 = BMC Central Greece 72.41 "Harmonia": Babelon 2.3.229/230.233 = B.V.

Normally, Thesmophoria were celebrated in the month equivalent to October /November. In Boiotia this was Damatnos. The name of the month itself suffices to show that this was the normal time in Boiotia, as elsewhere, for rites of Demeter. Indeed, Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride 69 (378D-E), writing about the rites of Demeter Achaia, says so explicitly. See DEMETER (UNSPECIFIED). The ritual at Potniai, which seems to be thesmophoric, also looks as if it would have taken place at the same time of year: see DEMETER (POTNIAI). The unusual date, which occurs at Delos as well as Thebes, is noted by P. Arbesmann, RE 6A (1936) sv 'Thesmo- phoria" 26 (he has no solution to offer), and M.P. Nilsson, Griechische Feste (Leipzig 1906) 3ìl;GGR 1 (Munich 1955) 464 note 1 and 465-466 (the rite may have been displaced, or another rite sacred to the same deities may have been given the name Thesmophoria). In the case of Thebes, the solution may lie in a possible connection between the Kadmeian cult and that at Potniai: there may have been proper Thesmophoria at the normal time at Potniai, preceded by an urban rite a month or so earlier. 168</page><page sequence="176">DEMETER (THESPIAI) DEMETER (THESPIAI) Epithets: Achaia Eleusinia (Pro---) With Kore Inscriptions ADelt 3 (1917) 353 note 4 BCH 26 (1902) 294.10; 50 (1926) 418.38; 419 note 2; 420.39 (in three parts, of which 39B was published as/G 7.1812); 421.40 IG 7.1810; 1812; 1867; 2148 Mélanges Perrot 195-199 SEG 19.369f.

They seem each to have been the special preserve of a different family.

This custom may explain the connection between Demeter and Herakles at Thespiai, which we have already noticed in the dedication of the temple to Demeter Eleusinia and Kore, and which is demonstrated on a relief from Episkopi of the second quarter of the fourth century B.C., depicting Herakles and Demeter;2 a similar explanation may account for the grouping of Demeter and Hermes on two inscriptions, BCH 50 (1926) 420.39 (from the Vale of the Muses) and 421.40, although there may be other, more arcane, reasons.3 Demeter and Kore, and Kore herself, appear on two other reliefs from Thespiai.4 These could be connected with either the Eleusinian pair or with Demeter Achaia. The same may be said for the rectangular base BCH 50 (1926) 418.38 bearing a dedication (in dialect) to Demeter. Dittenberger interpreted the fragmentary dedication/G 7.1810 as a dedication [. . .

IG 7.21 48 is the tombstone of a priestess of Demeter (no epithet is given) for life: I take this to be Demeter Achaia. Similarly with SEG 1 9.369f., the tombstone of another priestess of Demeter. Her name is Eupraxis, and it is probably no coincidence that she and the priestess in IG 7. 1 867 (Flavia Archela) are members of the same family; indeed Eupraxis may have been Flavia Ar chela's grand-daughter: see C.P. Jones, HStClPhil 74 (1970) 236. 2. Mélanges Perrot 195 199. The inscription is restored by P. Jamot as a dedication to Demeter and Herakles. He compares Demeter and Herakles the Idaian Daktyl at Mykalessos with Herakles the Idaian Daktyl at Thespiai, and concludes that this Herakles must be the Idaian Daktyl. But see DEMETER (MYKALESSOS), and note thai the Idaian Daktyl should be small in size, whereas this Herakles is if anything rather taller than Demeter, and both are larger than the two worshippers in the relief.

The other references are to ri Ttaxpuos t&amp;v Auovuaucav eo pxn (De Cupiditate Divitiarum), and nap' nytv iv tous ' AypucovuoLS (Quaestiones Conviviales). Modern scholarship has not been consistent in its use of these passages, and in fact only the description of the Agrionia finds its way regularly into the literature. It should therefore be noted that, although it is possible that Plutarch is referring to Chaironeian practices in either or both cases, it is equally possible that he is not. I think on the whole that he is writing about Chaironeia, if only because he tends to be explicit in making geographical attributions elsewhere.1 On this assumption, therefore, the Agrionia which Plutarch describes were a Chaironeian rite. In it, the women searched for Dionysos (1)£ óntoôeôpaxoToi , then stopped and said that itpòç xàc Moúaaç Kaxauecpeuyev xau nen puuxau nap' èneuvaus. Later, after dining, they asked each other riddles, a practice which Plutarch then goes on to rationalize. We have therefore a rite consisting of a ritual pursuit of the god by his female devotees (who fail to find him), a ritual feast, and post-prandial riddles (possibly magical in intent). The ritual has been compared to the pursuit of Dionysos in the Iliad } but at Chaironeia, Dionysos is not being bodily pursued: he is missing (the word used puts one in mind of a runaway slave) and is the object of a search. M.P. Nilsson compares this rite with the Nyktelia Hiera, and notes that the disappearance of the god is common in Dionysiac ritual3 and reflects the different phases of vegetation.4 Nilsson also brings in the Helikonian Muses to account for the Muses here, but Helikon is not very near to Chaironeia, and there are in any case Muses to hand at or near the town: see MUSES (CHAIRONEIA). We may have here a reflection of the situation at Orchomenos, where the cults of Dionysos and the Charités were closely associated, at least physically; but there is really no need to search for Muses: the reference means little more than "he has gone off somewhere far away and cannot be found". 1.

This looks very much like a rhetorical topos , and its value as a description of Chaironeian religious procedure is questionable. Of the inscriptions, IG 7.3392 contains two documents. The first three lines were added later, during the Roman period, and commemorate the liknophoria of one Satyros son of Paramonos (if the restoration is correct. Lolling's transcription is less clear then Dittenberger's text would suggest).1 The second part of the inscription, lines four to six, are the conclusion of a manumission decree (in dialect), naming the priest of Dionysos, the hierarchos, and one Timolaos as guardians of the manumitted. Manumission before Dionysos is not common;2 in Chaironeia it was usually performed before the Egyptian Gods, Artemis, or Asklepios. The fragmentary inscription IG 7.3409 appears to be a dedication to Dionysos and the polis, of a proskenion by a former agonothete of the Dionysia (and his wife? the inscription has had to be heavily restored). The proskenion calls to mind the small theatre at Chaironeia,3 and so does the inscription IG 7.3408, which may be restored as a choregic dedication, and which ought to belong to these Dionysia. There is no point in trying to connect a dramatic festival performed under the patronage of the god of drama with the ritual of the Agrionia. The latter may have encompassed the former, but there is not enough evidence. What is interesting is the presence of at least one choregic monument at Chaironeia, a near neighbour of Orchomenos, with its extended series of choregic monuments: see DIONYSOS (ORCHOMENOS).

The epithet Eleuthereus would appear to have been used at Athens, where it meant "the god from Eleutherai"; "at home", that is, in Eleutherai itself, Dionysos bore the epithet Eleutheros, a name which appears to have Mycenaean antecedents.3 It is a functional epithet. Most testimonia concerning Dionysos at Eleutherai may be said to concern the Athenian side of his worship, but two others may reflect the Boiotian aspect. Diodoros tells us that Dionysos, in gratitude to his homeland, Boiotia, freed all the cities, and founded a city in freedom's name, Eleutherai. This probably does not mean very much, except that it does connect Dionysos with Eleutherai, a Boiotian town. More to the point is Timagoras, FGrH 381 Fl, who writes of the Niobids and Niobe ontuovxas euç 'EÀeudepàc; è til Tcaxpuov duauav • This could refer to the rites of Dionysos performed by the Thebans on Mount Kithairon: see DIONYSOS (THEBES). Päusanias (1 .38.8) tells us that in the plain at or near Eleutherai, there was a temple of Dionysos, with a copy of the xoanon, the original of which had been removed to Athens. E.G. Stikas excavated what he suggested were the foundations of Pausanias' temple, near the crossroads of the former main Athens-Thebes highway with the road to Villia. He dated this building ca. 300 B.C. The epithet Melanaigis is connected in Suidas with the story of the daughters of Eleuther, whom the god drove mad. The story is one of the traditional aitia, and as such may be another link with the Theban cult. The epithet itself seems to have no counterpart in Boiotia, and is usually connected with the aition of the Athenaian Apatouria, which has no connection with this cult. 1.

DIONYSOS (HALIARTOS) Festival: Agrionia/ Theodaisia Kailima chos, 2 (fr. 43 Pf.) 86-92 Plutarch, Lysandros 28 (449D) Haliartos, the "city of Kadmos", celebrates the Cretan festival Theodaisia by the water of Kissoussa. This we are told by Kallimachos. The remainder of the fragment mentions Minos and Rhadamanthys, presumably in connection with Haliartos. Kallimachos seems to be the earliest surviving source for the tradition linking the Haliartia with Crete. This connection may depend on the discovery at Haliartos, in the fourth century B.C., of a prehistoric tomb identified as that of Alkmene: see ALEAS/ALEOS (HAU ARTOS), ALKMENE (HALIARTOS/ OKALEIA), and RHADAMANTHYS (HALIARTOS/OKALEIA). Alkmene was said to have co-habited with Rhadamanthys after the death of Amphitryon; late sources locate their dwelling place at Okaleia or Haliartos.1 The "Cretan connection" looks to me like a scholarly concoction, perhaps the work of Kallimachos himself . 2 Plutarch recounts the story that the infant Dionysos' nurses washed him in the waters of Kissoussa, thus accounting for the winey colour and excellent flavour of the water. Although this tale may not have much to recommend it, it does at least connect Dionysos with Kissoussa, and thus with the Theodaisia.3 The Cretan month Theodaisios fell during the period March/ April, 4 and so corresponds roughly to the Boiotian month Agrionios, which is when one would expect to find Agrionia celebrated. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the local name of the Dionysiac festival was Agrionia. 1. Okaleia: Pseudo-Apollodoros 2.4.1 i;Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 50.

Rhaikalos and Mount Kissos are in Macedonia, east of Thessalonike.1 It is possible, then that the horn- bearing Laphystian women - whether or not they were devotees of Dionysos (we have the word of the Scholiast to Lykophron that they were) - are to be located there. It is also possible that the word XacpuaT loi s is used here purely adjectivally, to describe the women as raving Bacchants, and not the god. Dionysos Laphystios is named in the paraphrase and Schol to Lykophron, and in Etymologicon Magnum (quoting the first sentence of the Schol , therefore of no independent value). It looks to me as if we have here another example of learned speculation on the part of the commentator, who was tempted to find a tidy meaning for Xacpuaxuas in the Boiotian mountain.2 1. See N.G.L.

This seems unlikely. In any case, Mount Laphystion is nearer to Koroneia and Lebadeia than it is to Orchomenos. J. Toepffer, Attische Genealogie (Berlin 1889) 189, connects Dionysos Laphystios with the myth of Athamas, "in dem Dionysos bekanntlich eine hervorragende Rolle spielt (Apd. III.4.3)". But all the passage in Pseudo-Apollodoros says is that Hermes gave the infant Dionysos to Ino and Athamas to rear, and that Hera in anger drove them both mad and to infanticide. This sounds more like the prologue to a play by Euripides than local cult practice. 177</page><page sequence="185">DIONYSOS (LARYMNA) - [DIONYSOS (MYKALESSOS)] DIONYSOS (LARYMNA) Päusanias 9.23.7 A temple and standing cult image of Dionysos.

Päusanias 9.30.1 (see 9.33.6); 9.38.1 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae 38 (299E-300A) The sanctuary of Dionysos at Orchomenos once housed a cult image by Myron, which was removed thence by Sulla to the Mouseion at Helikon.1 We can therefore conclude with some certainty that the cult of Dionysos was flourishing in Orchomenos in the middle of the fifth century B.C., and no doubt earlier.2 The foundations of a building near the theatre have been identified as those of the temple of Dionysos, and dated in the seventh century B.C. If this identification were secure, then it would be a very valuable datum.3 1. Pausanias 9.30.1, see 9.33.6. The manner in which Pausanias refers to the sanctuary of Dionysos at Orchomenos in 9.38.1 is rather odd, and suggests that there is either something missing from the text or that Pausanias did not have the opportunity to finish off his section on Orchomenos. What we read is ' Opxonevioiç ôè ireiroénrai mi At ovvoov, to 8è hpxaióraTov XapÍTtjv eortv iepóv. This comes at the very beginning of his description of the monuments of the town (previously we have been given a history of Orchomenos), and it does not fit well with what went before (it is the mi that worries me, although I may be expecting too much of Pausanias). Equally remarkable is the telegraphic way in which Pausanias introduces his description of individual monuments (with no regard to topographical sequence either): «fori 6e oipvoi mi Kprjvq déaç h %(a . . . drļoavpos ôè ò Mi vvov (9.38.2) . . . rá^oi Ôè Mwvov re mi 'Haióôou (9.38.3). It all looks vaguely unfinished. Either explanation, defect in the text, or incomplete autograph, might explain why there is no reference in Pausanias to the theatre (there is, of course, another possible explanation, namely, that Pausanias did not actually go to Orchomenos himself). 2. It is possible too that the story of the infant Dionysos' being given by Hermes to Ino and Athamas (Pseudo-Apollodoros 3.4.3) may go back to the fifth century B.C. (Euripides?) or thereabouts, and may have some connection with the worship of Dionysos at Orchomenos. However, the connection may just be a literary one. 3. But if this building really is of the seventh century B.C., would it not be a good candidate for the temple of the Charités, whose sanctuary was the oldest at Orchomenos (Pausanias 9.38.1)? 179</page><page sequence="187">DIONYSOS (ORCHOMENOS) The theatre, which the excavator dates late in the fourth century B.C., was the site of musical agons, commemorated by a series of tripod bases (and an epistyle) dedicated by successful choregoi, ranging from about the beginning of the third century B.C. to the first quarter of the second century B.C.1 An earlier inscription records a dedication to Dionysos by a former agonothete, of what seems to have been an entry-way.2 It seems reasonable to assume that the agon with which the choregic monuments were connected was celebrated in honour of Dionysos.3 literary sources going back to Korinna and Nikandros, that is, depending on where one dates Korinna, to the fifth or third century B.C., give various versions of the story of the Minyades, the daughters of Minyas.4 The story is typical of Dionysiac aitia, and in fact is given by Plutarch as the aition for the Orchomenian Agrionia. This rite took place every other year,5 that is, it was trieteric, a sound Dionysiac practice. It consisted of a ritual flight by women of a certain family (see below), and their pursuit by the priest of Dionysos, also a member of a specific family (the same as that of the women? this is not clear, but it is possible6), armed with a sword. The priest, if he caught any of the women, was permitted - or perhaps required - to kill her. This actually happened in Plutarch's lifetime, with unfortunate consequences for the poor lady and even for the priest, one Zoilos, whose own death was seen as a result of his action. The state too suffered on this occasion, if only financially. In the event, the priesthood was removed from the family, and became open to all (although how this was intended to avoid a repetition of the incident is not at all clear). A hint as to where the rite took place may appear in Hesy chios, si&gt; ' Aypuaveauov * áxóvxuov. Akontion was the name of the long hill at the eastern end of which Orchomenos is situated. Perhaps the Orchomenian Agrionia took place there?7 I have so far neglected to mention a serious problem in the text of Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae 38.

This is not impossible, of course. But a gloss in the Etymologicon Magnum , which seems generally to have been ignored,1 may help us. At 33.32, we read otLOÀeLOÇ , ó ïïolxlàoç ( ó ïïolk làoç is perhaps a gloss itself: see the apparatus criticus). It may be that AuoXe uau is the feminine of a¿o À e lo s (wherever the accent fell), and this might support the view that Aioleiai is to be taken in contrast to PSoloeis, the bright against the sooty, light versus dark. The added sense of restlessness implied in no l x là o g would also be suitable given the nature of the ritual. This still leaves ( hoil ) olojvoàools . We can retain the conjunction, and get *Oionoloai as another name for Aioleiai. This seems unlikely, because we ought to expect both names to appear in both places, not only in one. Or, we can accept something like the suggested oZov ÒÀocíç,2 as an explanation by Plutarch or an intrusive gloss. ' OÀoaç would then mean "murderous women", which I suppose is all right as far as the aition is concerned, but is certainly not if one considers the ritual itself. I can think of no satisfactory solution, but I doubt that this is reason enough to tamper with the text of ALOÀeLaL/ALOÀeLas , especially if the word now turns out not to be a hapax. There is, so far, no evidence to link the rites of the Agrionia as described by Plutarch with the musical contests of the choregic monuments, although the name Agrionia was used for the musical/dramatic agon at Thebes.3 At the village of Tzamali, some 3.5 km northwest of Orchomenos, an exploratory dig turned up sherds of pottery of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.: it was suggested that the site was a small rural sanctuary, and, because of the large number of remains of drinking vessels, this sanctuary was assigned to Dionysos.4 The attribution is of course as weak as it can possibly be, for all that it may be correct. It has had one definite result, however: Tzamali is now called "Dionysos". 1. It appears in LSJ but not in LSJ which may explain much, it not all. 2.

One would have to be very credulous indeed to take the cult aition which follows as serious evidence for human sacrifice.1 This story2 was intended to explain the epithet,3 and there is no proof at all that the worshippers of Dionysos at Potniai sacrificed goats to him, let alone humans.4 The epithet Aigobolos can mean either "goat-thrower" or "goat-shooter", the latter being the more commonly accepted meaning.5 L.R. Farnell would have the Potnian goat hung up and shot at, like Pentheus.6 The motifs of wildness and killing, which run through the aition, are not unfamiliar in Dionysiac traditions, but this need not lead us to conjecture too freely on the original nature of the cult at Potniai. The very fact that the aition uses familiar Dionysiac elements suggests that it may have been concocted on the spot by Pausanias' guides for his benefit. It should be remembered that Pausanias was sceptical about another Potnian tale, that of the ritual for Demeter and Kore: see DEMETER (POTNIAI). He appears to be less than credulous in recounting the story of the magical well at Potniai.7 We too may be reluctant to accept the aition as more than a good story.

From the sanctuary of Meter at Soros/Moustaphades comes another fifth century datum, a relief depicting Dionysos, Mainads, and possibly Meter and Pan: see METER (SOROS/MOUSTAPHADES). All of this is enough to show that Dionysos was worshipped in the Tanagraia during the classical period. Of even greater interest to Pausanias and his contemporaries than the statue by Kalamis, was the Triton, which was in the temple of Dionysos. Pausanias gives two aitia for the Triton, both connected with Dionysos. The first has it that while the women of Tanagra were in the sea, cleansing themselves before the orgies of Dionysos, the Triton attacked them: they called upon the god, who came to their aid, and killed the Triton in battle. In the second aition, which Pausanias preferred, the Triton used to waylay cattle and boats, until the people of Tanagra set out a krater of wine for him: attracted by the aroma, the Triton came ashore, drank, became drunk, fell asleep, and had his head chopped off with an axe by a man from Tanagra. This explains why the Triton in Tanagra was headless, and the wine accounts for the association with Dionysos. The first aition is a variation on a conventional Dionysiac aition, the second is a secular, rationalizing version. The first seeks to link the Triton with Dionysos through his cult, the second merely to explain how the Triton got into the temple and why it lacked a head. Both are of limited value. 1. On this, see J. Dörig, Jdi 80 (1965) 186-192. 183</page><page sequence="191">DIONYSOS (TANAGRA) We are left with a temple of Dionysos, which contained a cult image and a headless object reputed to be a sea monster. By a happy coincidence, the testimony of Pausanias is confirmed by Tanagran bronze coins, in two series. The first, of which there seems to be only one example, is Augustan, with what may be Dionysos depicted on the reverse. The second, of which there are several examples, was minted through- out the second century A.D.1 (thus in part contemporary with Pausanias), and depicts on the reverse Dionysos, under a canopy or roof supported by two figures - identified as Atlantes or Telamones - on pillars; below is a Triton, complete with head. The weight of scholarly opinion appears to favour identifying the Dionysos on the second series with the statue by Kalamis. There is a problem with the Triton, however. The Triton on display at Tanagra was headless - a mummified sea-beast, according to Damostratos (quoted by Ailian, De Natura Animalium 1 3.21) - but the Triton on the coins has a head. Some have therefore concluded that this could not have been the same Triton as the one that Pausanias saw.2 The usual assumption is that Dionysos and the Triton on the coins are meant to represent either what Pausanias saw, or, if not, then some cultic connection between the two. This, however, fails to account for the two figures on either side of Dionysos. These are baldly identified as Atlantes/Telamones and otherwise ignored. It is true that Atlantes/Telamones are conventional figures in Greek art,^ but their appearance on coins of Tanagra may be more than conventional. Atlas, in fact, had a special place in Tanagran mythology. At Tanagra, there was, according to Pausanias 9.20.3, Ilo À o g xe óvoyaçóy evov X^ptov. êvxau§a "AxÀavxa xa^nyevov ïïoÀUïïpayyoveuv xa xe utio yñs (pa au xau xa o upáv ua . The Atlantes, therefore, may be significant in a local Tanagran context, and the coins may simply be depicting three of the noteworthy objects in Tanagran cult and legend: Atlas, the Triton, and Dionysos; or, put another way, the famous statue of Dionysos by Kalamis, set in a purely Tanagran context, provided by Atlas and the Triton. There may be no justification for using the coins as proof of a cult connection between Dionysos and the Triton. The fact that Pausanias was told two aitia linking the two is no evidence, since they account only for the physical location of the headless monster (? a large mummified fish) in the temple of Dionysos, and indeed, the very existence of two aitia makes both of them suspect. The association of the Triton with Dionysos seems not to pre-date the second century A.D.; earlier data, namely the Augustan coin (if it is Dionysos on the reverse), and Damostratos, do not connect Dionysos and the headless monster; even before this, the Tanagran sea-monster was a by-word, and a pair of Tritons, without any apparent connection with Dionysos, are used as a decorative motif on a terracotta figurine from Tanagra, dated in the second quarter of the sixth centryy B.C.4 It is not necessary to posit a cult "Verdrängung"5 or indeed any intimate connection between the Triton and Dionysos. It is enough that the rites of Dionysos involved purification in sea water, and that the Triton was a sea monster, to see the logic in housing in the god's temple the remains of what the Tanagrans chose to call a Triton. The very fact that this "pseudo- Triton" - headless, armless - was so unlike the artistic representations of the Triton of which we know, should warn us against confusing the folkloric and artistic imaginations on the one hand with the conscious archaizing and rationalizing of the people, who, on finding a suitable candidate, named it after a well known figure of local folklore. 1.

The close connection with Thebes has resulted in the accretion of numerous purely literary references of a banal nature, which are of no significance for the actual cult of Dionysos as practiced at Thebes. Furthermore, much of the later evidence, both from Thebes and elsewhere, shows signs of having been influenced by the detailed, and probably basically accurate, evidence for the cult supplied by Euripides in the Bakchai. In what follows, I shall limit the discussion as closely as possible to what is known about the cult. Since our earliest surviving literary sources, i.e. Homer and Hesiod, place the birth of Dionysos to Semeie and Zeus at Thebes, we may assume that the god was worshipped there in late geometric times, if not earlier as well. We may also assume with certainty that his sanctuary was in the polis proper, i.e., on the Kadmeia. This was certainly the case in the fifth century B.C.: Pindar calls the Theban Dionysos the paredros of Demeter1 (whatever other meaning the passage may have, its topographical significance is inescapable). More explicit is Euripides, in the Bakchai , where the focal point of the sanctuary of Dionysos is the ari ko s of Semeie, a place named in the amphiktyonic inscription of late in the third century B.C. {SEG 19.379), and described by Päusanias (9.12.3). Both this inscription and Pausanias, and the inscription IG 4.682, call Dionysos by the epithet Kadmeios, clearly a topographical term.2 According to Euripides, the arixoç of Semeie {Bakchai 11), which he also calls her y vři y a (6)/xá(pos (597: in Pausanias' day the tomb of Semeie was thought to be near the temple of Dionysos Lysios, see below), lay near the ruins of her bedchamber (presumably in Kadmos' house, although Euripides does not say so specifically), destroyed by the lightning hurled on Semeie by Zeus. Kadmos, i.e. the people of Thebes, had declared the place to be agaxoç . It may or may not have contained an "eternal flame", and been surrounded with ivy. This suggests a very simple open-air sanctuary, perhaps associated with the ruins of one or more buildings old enough to have been classified as monuments in the fifth century B.C. The Delphic inscription S KG 19.379 adds no details to the description of the sanctuary, except that it was sacred to Dionysos surnamed Kadmeios, and that the ari ko g of Semeie was still its focus. 1. Isthmian 7.3 5. See DEMETER (THEBES), and note the relief cited in the testimonia, on which Dionysos and Demeter appear together. 2. All standard editions of Pausanias to date give the reading Kaößöv (La) over KáônuivlKaÔneiòv of the other manu- scripts. Mere epigraphy has come to the aid of philology and shown clearly - although not clearly enough for some, for example, L. Ziehen, RE 5 A (1934) sv "Thebai" (1) 1509 - and unequivocally that the reading should be Kaößefov. The inscriptions in question (IG 4.682 and SEG 19.379) are dealt with below, p. 189 note 2(a). Although they provide the earliest known examples of the epithet, there is a hint that it was used in the fifth century B.C.: at Sophokles, Oidipous Tyrannos 210, Dionysos is invoked as râaô' ewe ovvpov yãç. This might be taken to mean "you who give your name to this land", or, "you who take your name from this land". In the latter case, Thebes being the "land of Kadmos", the Theban Dionysos might well be "the Kadmeian". See my article in Mélanges d'Etudes Anciennes offerts à Maurice Lebel (Quebec 1 980) 113-117. 187</page><page sequence="195">DIONYSOS (THEBES) Pausanias' description is the fullest, and even though we must admit that the prologue to the Bakchai must have influenced the later antiquaries of Thebes in their identification of the site, I think it is clear that the sanctuary of the second century A.D. was basically the same as it has been in the fifth century B.C., that is, an open-air abaton, the %á'a'ioç of Semeie (no longer her tomb). But now, the ruins of which the bridal chamber was a part were identified as those of the House of Kadmos. The god's epithet is still Kadmeios. The sanctuary in Pausanias' day also included, near the bridal chamber, a bronze cult image by the otherwise unknown Onasimedes, and an altar attributed to the sons of Praxiteles. The last suggests a period of renewed activity at the end of the fourth or early in the third, century B.C., that is, the time when Thebes was being reconstructed.1 Pausanias also relates the story of a log, which fell from heaven when Zeus hurled his thunderbolt . This log, adorned with bronze by Polydoros, was called Dionysos Kadmeios, that is, it was the original cult image. It is to be noted that Pausanias does not say that he saw the adorned log (on the other hand, he is specific about the contemporary cult image by Onasimedes), so whether it ever existed or not is not certain. Nevertheless, it is possible that the early cult image of Dionysos on the Kadmeia was a wooden one,2 either, as some have suggested, a remnant of the Mycenaean palace (romantic, and unlikely), or a tree trunk or pillar, along the lines of the adorned pillar topped by the head of Dionysos known from ancient art.3 Dionysos' popularity in Thebes is reflected in the symbols on Theban coins from the fifth century B.C. on, but unfortunately these coins tell us nothing else about the cult.4 The plot of Euripides' Bakchai is an elaboration of the standard Dionysiac aition for the Agrionia and related rites: the god is not made welcome by his potential worshippers, the local royal house; he drives the three princesses mad, they kill the prince /king, the god is accepted. Here the story is grafted on to the tradition of the birth of Dionysos at Thebes, and associated with what must have been the local custom of the thiasoi of women celebrating the Agrionia on Mount Kithairon.5 We can assume that this rite was celebrated in Thebes and on Kithairon during the fifth century B.C. The special status of Thebes as the reputed homeland of Dionysiac worship is to be seen in the inscription Michel 856, of Magnesia on the Maiander,6 where the Delphic oracle instructs the Magnesians to turn to Thebes for expert advice and experts in the installation of a cult of Dionysos, and in the aition for the cult image of Dionysos Lysios at Sikyon (Päusanias 2.2.7 and 2.7.6), said to have been brought thither from Thebes. Perhaps in these cases too we should find signs of the influence on cult of Euripides' play. 1. On the sons of Praxiteles (Kephiśodotos II and Timarchos), see C.M.

The inscriptions tell us that it was celebrated in honour of Dionysos Kadmeios, that it was trieteric, and that it was directed jointly by the city of Thebes and Dionysiac technitai.2 It might have been instituted after, or to commemorate, the 1 .

Now, although a purely musical agon might not require a theatre, a dramatic one would (that this agon contained dramatic competitions is clear from lines 34-35 of this inscription), and the top of the Kadmeia is not the place for a theatre. Something else seems to be needed to fill the gap in line 14. I put the matter to D.M.

Perhaps it was intended to distinguish the agonistic elements of the festival (called a panegyris in line 20) from the religious ones, which went under the name of Agrionia. Later on, in the second and first centuries B.C., the name Agrionia was given to the agon (see above, p. 189 note 1). L. Robert, AE (1977 [1979]) 208, proposes the following explanation of why the agon is not called Agrionia in SEG 19.379: "Les Thébains, qui s'étaient associés aux Technites pour créer la fete, obtiennent bien des amphictions la reconnaissance de l'asylie du sanctuaire de Dionysos Cadmeios, - reconnaissance qui dépendait d'abord de l'amphictionie. Mais ils n'eurent guère de succès dans l'annonce de la fete. C'est plus tard que la fete de Dionysos à Thèbes fut réformée - toujours avec le concours de Technites - et qu'elle fut acceptée, non plus sous le nom de Cadmeia - que l'on peut tirer de 'trietérides de Dionysos Cadmeios' -, mais sous le nom, dionysiaque lui aussi, d 'Agrionia". This reads more into the evidence than one would have thought possible.

Celebration of the agonistic Agrionia is attested from the third to the first century B.C.,1 after which there is a gap in the evidence until late in the second century A.D.: then there was celebrated a combined athletic and musical agon, under the name of Dionyseia Herakleia (Antoneineia).2 The musical and dramatic agons must have taken place at a theatre, and indeed, Pausanias informs us that there was a theatre at Thebes, near the so-called Proitidan Gates, and that next to it was a temple of Dionysos, with two cult images, one of Dionysos, the other of Semeie (9.16.6). This reflects the cult complex of the sanctuary of Dionysos Kadmeios.3 The god by the theatre bears the epithet Lysios. Pausanias relates an aition which is a variation of one given by Herakleides Pontikos, fr. 155 Wehrli. There is another aition, briefly given,4 and attributed to one Aristophanes, who has been identified with both the comic poet and the Byzantine. I am a little surprised that no one has as yet thought that he might have been Aristophanes of Boiotia ( FGrH 379), who flourished, according to F. Jacoby, before 370 B.C. If it is the Boiotian Aristophanes, we then have two fourth century B.C. sources for the establishment of the ritual (Lysioi Teletai), perhaps around the third decade of the century, which fits quite nicely, because it was at this time that the Thebans would have seen themselves as being freed from oppression. Later on, when the agonistic elements of the Agrionia required the construction of a theatre, the temple adjoining it was called that of Dionysos Lysios, perhaps in emulation of the Athenian model, where Dionysos Eleuthereus had a temple at the theatre (the similarity in meaning of the epithets must have been influential). In fact, it may have been to provide for this temple (and the theatre?) that Eumenes II of Pergamon gave money for the purchase of sacred land.5 Pausanias' guides told him that the temple of Dionysos Lysios was open once a year on fixed days. This need mean no more than that it was used only during celebrations of dramatic festivals in honour of Dionysos. 1. Only the superscription of one victors' list can be definitely assigned to the Agrionia: IG 7.2447 . Two partial victors' lists have been connected with the Agrionia: AE (191 7) 1 66-167, by M. Feyel, and IG 7.2448, by A.J. Gossage, BSA 70 (1975) 1 32 (see the Index of Inscriptions for bibliography). It is tempting to connect with the musical/dramatic Agrionia a series of bronze coins of Thebes, conventionally dated ca. 146-27 B.C., bearing a lyre on the obverse: BMC Central Greece 88.210-21 1 (on the reverse is a torch between two ears of corn and two poppyheads; the coin would therefore represent both Demeter and her Theban paredros, Dionysos). 2.

Still in the fourth century B.C. is an interesting relief from Niochori (west of Thespiai) in the Thebes Museum. There are five figures (from right to left)5 : Dionysos and Herakles (both easily recognizable from their attributes), and three female figures, of whom the first (in the centre of the relief) faces away from Dionysos and Herakles and towards the other two, who, like Dionysos and Herakles, are seen facing. All the figures are of the same size, so it is likely that the three females are also divine. These ladies have been identified as nymphs.6 I would prefer to take them to be the Helikonian Muses - on the number, see MUSES (THESPIAI) - and the relief as a whole to be a representation of three important Thespian cults. Perhaps the position of the central figure is intended to signify the geographical separation of the cults, the Muses at Helikon, Dionysos and Herakles at Thespiai. From about the same period (third quarter of the fourth century B.C.) comes the bottom half of a relief in Berlin, bought at Athens, but apparently of Boiotian material and work, depicting Dionysos and Pan, which has been attributed to Thespiai.7 A hellenistic altar or base from Thespiai depicts, on one long side, a Dionysiac scene (from left to right: Dionysos, a female - Ariadne? -, an altar, a krater, a satyr - ? - leading a goat to the altar).8 One other monument has been recorded, a marble head of the bearded Dionysos.9 An inscription of ca. 230-220 B.C., concerning the letting of lands, mentions at line 33 (the stone at this point is very badly mutilated)-- Auwvoiîaoo rö--.

The pro-Spartan bias of the people of Thespiai continued at least until the first part of the fourth century B.C.3 It is, therefore, not surprising to find evidence of Spartan influence among the cults of Thespiai, in the Dioskouroi, and in the case of the "Hero Kasstoridas", to whom a stele from near Thespiai was dedicated.4 This too is a fairly early dedication. From a later century comes a dedication to a "Hero Prokles"5 : if this "hero" was divine, and not a heroized dead person, he might be connected with a character by that name in the legendary genealogy of the Spartan kings.6 The small bas e,BCH 50 (1926) 422.41 , records a dedication by the xáíteuÀoç Dion to the Dioskouroi (as patron of travellers?).

There they performed certain rituals (the text is faulty here), the traces of which they then obliterated and went off. We know of some other rituals involving public officials at Thebes at this season: the Aphrodisia celebrated by the outgoing polemarchs, the taking of the omens by the priests of Demeter Thesmophoros: see APHRODITE (THEBES), DEMETER (THEBES). These two rituals, like that of the hipparch, were connected with the end of term of incumbent magistrates, and the inauguration of new ones.1 The location of Dirke's tomb remains a secret to this day.2 1. There was, in addition, the oath sworn by members of the Sacred Band at the tomb or herôon of Iolaos: see IOLAOS (THEBES). No doubt there were others as well. F. Vian, Les Origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963) 104-106, has suggested that the ritual at Dirke's tomb (to which he sees a reference in Sophokles, Oidipous Kobneus 1530-1534) was of great antiquity, and that it revealed the importance of Dirke as equivalent to "l'ime même de la cité". In this connection, it is interesting to see that Pindar, Isthmian 8.19-21, juxtaposes Dirke with the epithet yCkapnaTov, qualifying Thebes: perhaps this too is a reflection of the secret ritual linking the hipparch (who had, at least at first, responsibility for the state's cavalry) with Dirke. 2. Euripides, Antiope fr. XLVIII Kambitsis, lines 80 ff., 112 ff., is no help for this problem, nor for the rite, to which no reference is made. One wonders too, at a possible connection between Dirke and Amphion and Zethos, the '€VK01T¿j'u ). 198</page><page sequence="206">DORY (CHAIRONEIA) DORY (CHAIRONEIA) Päusanias 9.40. 11-12 Päusanias tells us that the people of Chaironeia worshipped, above all other gods, the sceptre which Hephaistos had made for Zeus, and which they called ôo pu . It had been found, they said, in the border land between Chaironeia and Panopeus. The sceptre was kept in the house of its annual priests, sacrifices were offered to it daily, and a table full of meats and cakes was set by it. There are two plausible explanations1 of this: 1) The sceptre was discovered in a prehistoric tomb and venerated because of its age and perhaps the grandeur of the tomb. This discovery might have occurred within the living memory of Pausanias' informants, as it is difficult to imagine Plutarch's not having written of it if he had known of its existence. 2) On the other hand, the name ôo pu suggests that it might have been a relic of the paraphernalia of local government. At Thebes, for example, in the fourth century B.C., the archons, that is, the elected officials, carried to ôopu xaí, xřiv o cp pay Z ôa as insignia of office.2 This suggestion might gain support from Pausanias' note that the ôopu was kept in the house of the annual priest, that is, that it changed hands every year. 1 .

The major deity of the triad in the hellenistic period is Sarapls.5 1€ G. Sotiriadis refers to numerous inscriptions of the third and second centuries B.C., at Ayia Paraskevi. These included manumission decrees sworn before Sera pis/Sara pis, and Asklepios and Hygieia. Since two of the archons' names and that of the priest, which Sotiriadis mentions, do not appear in the/G 7 inscriptions, it is clear that his group includes unpublished documents. 2. IG 7.3354 is ìiot strictly speaking a manumission decree, but concerns the fulfilment of a paramona. It is interesting to note that while most of the decrees in the Boiotian dialect use the form Eápamç, a number ( IG 7.3314, 3318, 3352, 3356) use Lepamç (conversely, IG 7.3363, in koine, has Eápamç). Compare the variation between Karaios/Keraios of Zeus (Vidman 28.53 at Thespiai, in another dialect inscription with Serapis). 3. See F.

Most of the manumittors were Chaironeians, but a number came from nearby towns: Daulis {IG 7.3333), Lebadeia (3360), Panopeus (3376).2 If IG 7.3426 is a reliable guide, the worship of the Egyptian gods seems to have moved up the social scale in the inter- vening centuries. EGYPTIAN GODS (HYLAI/HYLE) AAA 3(1970)102-105 The inscription, published by S.N. Koumanoudis, was found at Xironomi. It records the dedication (by L. Vibullius Spanios and his wife Vibullia Polleita, liberti of one Vibullius3) to Isis, Serapis, the polis of Thespiai, and the kome of Hylai/Hyle,4 of statues of Isis and Harphokrates, the base, the dupoSyaxa , altar, and xávxeÀÀ oç .5 It dates from the second century A.D. See EGYPTIAN GODS (THESPIAI). 1. See G. Sotiriadis, AM 30 (1905) 118. 2. An interesting feature of a number of these manumission decrees is the description of the manumittor as i epóç C IG 7.3367) or lapá/lepá (IG 7.3315; 3331; 3333; 3366; 3374; 3377; perhaps 3355). A. Calderini, La Manomissione e la Condizione dei Liberti in Grecia (Milan 1908) 176 note 3, maintained, against Drachmann (to whom he refers) that these were priestesses and a priest as at Delphi (with reference to SGDI 21 60 and 2242; add 21 63). In this he is followed by T.A. Brady, The Reception of the Egyptian Cults by the Greeks (330-30 B.C.) (Columbia, Missouri 1935) pro so pogra phi cal index. However, the parallel with Delphi is not exact, and I think that Drachmann was right to see these people as freed slaves themselves. In every case but one the Hiera/Hieros is accompanied by a hierarch as legal guardian (elsewhere in this dossier, the office of guardian - marked by the word napóvroq - is filled by husbands of women and fathers of minors). In other words, the state appointed a guardian because, presumably, the Hiera/Hieros had no legal rights in her/his own person. The one exception proves the rule: in IG 7.3315, Euphrosyna, lapa rSç Marépoç tCjv [0 ] tZjv, has no guardian appointed by the state, since she is married to a citizen. The only other Hiara with a husband is an outsider from Daulis, who seems herself to be married to another freed slave (IG 7.3333: no Hiera/Hieros has a patronymic; nor does the husband of the Daulian woman): she therefore has a hierarch to stand by her. See also P. Roesch and J.M. Fossey, ZPE 29 (1978) 1 36, and K.-D. Albrecht, Rechst- probleme in den Freilassungen der Böotier, Phoker, Dorier, Ost- und Westlokrer (Paderborn 1978) 126-127. This is another function of hierarchs to add to those given by P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 204-205 (by the way, of the inscriptions listed in note 9 on p. 204, only IG 7.3392 is evidence for there being one hierarch at Chaironeia). The same view of the manumitting Hiera/Hieros is taken by F. Dunand (cited above, p. 200 note 3) 2.34-35 (who, on p. 35, mistakes the role of the hierarch). 3. The stone reads (lines 1 to 3) A.

Vibullius Spanios and his wife Vibullia, and Polleita was his freed slave, who was one of the objects dedicated. This does not fit the sense of the rest of the inscription (it would require that the recipients be inserted in the middle of the list of objects dedicated). I would prefer something like one of the alternative solutions which have been proposed: J. and L. Robert, Bull, épigr. 71.340: noAÀeira ì$(oviie piovi) ObeißovKkiov à7reÀ.(eú0epoi); G.

There is no need to suppose that this village was the Hyle of Homer (Iliad 2.500; 5.707f.).

IG 7.540: IG 7 contains only part of the victors' list. The rest of the document was added to it by Ch. Christou, AE (1956 [1959]) 34-72 ( SEG 19.335); it was subsequently studied by M. Calvet and P. Roesch, /M (1966) 297-332 (SEG 25.501). The inscription is dated 97-95 B.C. by Christou (p. 67; on p. 43 he had suggested 85 B.C. or rather 90 at the latest; on pp. 45, 46, and 47, 90 B.C. at the latest. A.J. Gossage,2?&amp;4 70 [1975] 127, refers to p. 43 for Christou's dating). This he does on prosopographical grounds. I would be happy with a less precise date, early in the first century B.C., before the Mithridatic war. The content of the inscription suggests that it was inscribed during a period of calm and stability: this is clear from the report of the commissioner Kaphisias, which speaks not only for the year in which the current Sarapieia took place, but for four years before and even more, if we assume, as we may, that Kaphisias' predecessor, Mnasikon, also inherited a healthy or at least undisturbed account. Calvet and Roesch have pointed out that the Sarapieia were pentaeteric (pp. 315 and 316), and that they took place during the month Homoloios (May/June) (p. 316). The funds for the organization of the Sarapieia were obtained from the interest on a sum of money dedicated by one Charilaos. The agon was not the only beneficiary of Charilaos(see below, p. 204 note 1), although it was the largest one (in fact, the income paid for the provision of prizes, rental of costumes, hiring of choruses, chorusmasters, flute players, sacrifices and dinners - see below, and p. 204 note 1 - and the cost of inscription. Presumably the state provided a theatre and other facilities; the judges, at least, received free board at the agonothete's personal expense). The fund also paid for expenses incurred by the phratries (lines 66-67: h'' [w/lu*t] a etç r[à] ç iparpùiç) to the tune of 1627 drachmas, a large amount of money, relatively speaking, when one considers that the budget of the Sarapieia was 3276 drachmas. It also paid a fee of twenty drachmas to an architect. From this we may assume, first, that part of Charilaos' foundation took the form of money for the building and maintenance of a sanctuary, presumably of the Egyptian gods. This seems a reasonable interpretation of the architect's fee. Second, that Charilaos set up a whole cult organization (see the will of Epikteta: IG 1 2.3.330), based perhaps on kinship (note that many of the officials named in the inscription are related to each other), and that members of this association were divided into Ph(r)atries (based on kinship? - on the religious, as opposed to political, use of the term in late antiquity, see J. Seyfarth,Aegyptus 35 [1955] 34-36; note also F. Poland, Geschichte des Griechischen Vereinswesens [Leipzig 1906] 52-53), which were provided with money (annually? or on the occasion of the celebration of the Sarapieia? or at other intervals? Note that in the four-year period for which we have the accounts, there is no mention of expenditures, except for the last year, that of the Sarapieia: see Calvet and Roesch, p. 312) from the funds. I presume that these moneys paid for the expenses of the phratries, such as special meetings, sacrifices, banquets (see again Epikteta 's will). Calvet and Roesch, p. 323, refer to IG 7.1661, from Tanagra, as the only other Boiotian reference to a phratry: IAni ... I EI AS ... I &lt;ï&gt;ATP . . . Could there be a reference to Sarapieia here? In the apologia of the commissioner Kaphisias, eight officials are named: the agonothete Glaukos son of Boukattes; the commissioner himself, Kaphisias son of Boukattes; his predecessor, Mnasikon; four men who are eponymous for their years (Kaphisias, in the first year of Kaphisias son of Boukattes' commission; Glaukos; Xenon; Boukattes, in the year of the Sarapieia); and Kaphisias' successor as commissioner, Thorakides son of Herakleides. Christou (p. 69) identified the eponymous officials not as archo ns of Tanagra, but as priests of Sarapls. He may be right in this, since the victors' list is headed, not, as one would expect, by the names of the archon and the agonothete, but only by that of the agonothete. It may be that the Sarapieia and indeed all the bodies which benefitted from Charilaos' foundation, were directed not by the state, but by the administrators of the cult which he paid for. This might explain how so many of the officials come to be related to each other. They would be members of one or more phratries established by Charilaos for the organization of the cult; from their number the priests of the Egyptian gods, and the administrators of the agon, would be selected. There are some textual problems: lines 53-55: Glaukos the agonothete paid out of his own pocket for the daily oaths [mi ràq èa)Tt]áaetç túv nad * rißepap rov hyCjvoq rCòv re KpiTŮv [ mi tcxvit&amp;v | mi x'opCjv mi uiKrļoavTCJV. The restoration [/cat tcx^itCjv] in line 54 was made by Christou. Calvet and Roesch accept this, but J. and L. Robert, Z?m//. épigr. 61.336 and 68.285, are not certain. Aside from the fact that the daily feeding of the technitai by the agonothete would raise his generosity to the level of extravagance, the presence of vwnoávTCjv among the fed precludes the restoration T€xvtT&amp;v, for if the victors are not themselves technitai, then what are they? or must we believe that the victors were fed twice, once in their capacity of technitai, and a second time as victors? I think that what we need to 203</page><page sequence="211">EGYPTIAN GODS (TANAGRA) - EGYPTIAN GODS (THEBES) amount of religious and festive activity.1 Fragments of three other victors' lists, all on the same block of stone, have been attributed to the same agon.2 Two reliefs from Tanagra depict women dressed as priestesses of Isis.3 EGYPTIAN GODS (THEBES) Inscriptions IG 7.2482; 2483; 2681 Relief IG 7.2483 (see Index of Inscriptions for bibliography).

Some of this activity had clearly been ordained by the founder, Charilaos (see above, p. 203 note 1): not only is payment for the sacrifice to Sarapis, Isis, and the other gods, and the sacral meal accounted for by the agonothete, but they are qualified by the phrase Kara to yĻrYpL(o)ļxa. Other acts - daily oaths and feasting of specified groups of people (see above p. 203 note 1) and funds for entòv/ia and pao[ßa] (see Calvet and Roesch, p. 317-318) - are paid for by the agonothete personally. It is not certain whether they were part of the original foundation, in which case the agonothete was in effect donating money to the fund, or whether they were extra expenses, which an agonothete could or could not assume in his own name, and to his own credit. 2.

Koumanoudis has collected most of the known material about the cult of the emperors at Thebes.1 According to Koumanoudis, the two known bearers of the name Pemptides - Pemptides and Titus Flavius Pemptides - were father and son respectively, the first being the magistrate whose name appears on the three Theban coin types,2 and the second appearing on a number of Theban inscriptions.3 The prosopographical links do indeed exist, but it is impossible to be certain that they are as neat as Koumanoudis makes them out to be. We are not helped by the fact that the inscriptions are almośt all clumsily done and/or lacunary, and that some stretching has to be done to work in the name Pemptides (see note 3). What concerns us here is the connection of the family with the cult of the emperors at Thebes. This is indicated by the coins, at least; Koumanoudis carries the connection farther in dealing with SEG 15.329, on which Titus Flavius Pemptides is the hierarch in charge of the dedication by the Thebans of an anaktoron Geous Eeßaaxoug Me&lt;y&gt;aÀous Ka | ßeupa)&lt;u&gt; Kau Ilauôú. The epithets, if taken together, are rather strange, and Koumanoudis' solution is ingenious. He suggests that the two emperors, Vespasian and Titus, were equated by the Thebans with the Great Gods, Kabeiros and Pais.4 Vespasian and Titus had temples built for them at Rome by Domitian,5 so the grouping is not impossible. But is it necessary to take the whole list of recipients as one? The inscription is so clumsily 1. S.N. Koumanoudis, Xapi orripiov eiç A. K. 'OpXavÔóv 2 (Athens 1966) 1-21. 2. B.V.

It is to be recalled that the object of the inscription is to record the dedication of an anaktoron, a clear sign of Samothracian influence at the Kabirion - see KABIROI (KABIRION) - and, in fact, this is the only known occasion on which the Theban Kabiroi are called (Theoi) Megaloi, the name of the Samothracian deities.

Here were buried Argives who had accompanied Aigialeus in his expedition against Thebes. The number included several of the leaders, of whom Promachos son of Parthenopaios is named. Elsewhere (1.44.4 and 9.8.6), Pausanias tells us that the battle between the Epigonoi and the Thebans took place at Glisas. Whether this information came from a literary source, or from local Theban antiquaries, it explains why the tumulus in question should have been identified with the tomb of the Epigonoi. However, Pausanias 9.19.2 is at variance with the main tradition, according to which only Aigialeus, of the Epigonoi, was killed.1 This discrepancy might be attributed to the inefficiency of Pausanias' local informants; on the other hand, the story as we have it is sketchy, and there may have been another version in which others of the invading leaders besides Aigialeus were killed. The monument itself would seem to have been some kind of tomb or burial plot, but whether there was ever a cult attached to it is anybody's guess.2 1.

The roie of Eros in the Theogony is not my concern; the unworked stone which Pausanias saw is. It may be conceded that this was a "Steinfetisch"; others existed in Boiotia, according to Pausanias - see CHARITES (ORCHOMENOS), HERAKLES (HYETTOS). However, it does not necessarily follow that an aniconic image was also an old one; and, even if the stone which Pausanias saw was an old one, there is no guarantee that it always went by the name "Eros". We have only the word of Pausanias' local informants that this was so. Nothing in the earlier sources even hints at this stone in relation to Eros at Thespiai. It is also possible , nor is there anything in the evidence to contradict it , that the cult of Eros at Thespiai owed its existence to the statue which Praxiteles gave to Phryne, and which she set up in her home town, Thespiai.2 Phryne's close personal association with this cult is also to be seen in the statues of her and of Aphrodite, also by Praxiteles, which stood in the temple of Eros.3 1. For example, F. Jacoby, Hermes 61 (1926) 166- 167: (166: "Man hat in diesem Eros längst den rohen Steinfetisch von Thespiai erkannt"); O. Kern ,Die Religion der Griechen 1 (Berlin 1926) 251 ("Die warme Lobpreisung des Eros ist im Munde des Hesiodos eine Huldigung fur den ehrwürdigen Gott von Thespiai, dessen Kultbild nicht in strahlender Götterschöne vor dem Bauer von Askra stand, sondern der in einem schlichten, urwüchsigen Fetisch verehrt wurde"). See M.L. West, ed., Hesiod, Theogony (Oxford 1966) on line 120; S. Fasce, Eros: La Figura e II Culto (Genoa 1977) 16 and note 5. 2. It may be worth remarking that Eros does not appear on reliefs from Thespiai which depict deities worshipped there in the late classical period: Mélanges Perrot 195-199 (see Index of Inscriptions for bibliography: Demeter and Herakles), and Ch. Karouzos, To Mouaefo rffc ©?70aç. 'O Ôrjyóç (Athens 1934) 39.135 (= W. Schild-Xenidou, Boiotische Grab- und Weihreliefs Archäischer und Klassischer Zeit [Munich 1972] 65.75: Dionysos, Herakles, and three goddesses). The Praxitelian Eros was famous (see the epigrams), and, according to Cicero and Strabo, was the only reason people used to visit Thespiai. Pausanias (9.27.3) tells us that it was removed to Rome by Caligula, restored by Claudius, removed again by Nero, and finally destroyed by fire (see Pliny, Naturalis Historia 36.22). What Pausanias saw at Thespiai was a copy by an Athenian sculptor, Menodoros (9.27.4: A. Plassart, BCH 50 [1926] 404.20, suggested that the epigram published there was inscribed on the base of this copy). Ch. Picard , Manuel d'Archéologie Grecque 3 (Paris 1948) 439 note 2, was much exercised by the fact that Thespiai was sacked in 372 B.C. and not rebuilt until after 338 B.C.: "Quand et comment a pu se produire ainsi la consécration des statues? On doit admettre que certains temples avaient subsisté après 372 (?) et continuaient á recevoir des hommages". Yes, that is possible, especially as we do not know the extent to which Thespiai would have suffered. But there really is no problem, I think. Phryne need not have dedicated the Eros until relatively late in her life, during her "retirement", perhaps at Thespiai itself. She was still alive and going strong in 315 B.C. or thereabouts, if the anecdote about her proposed contribution to the re-walling of Thebes is valid: Kallistratos, FGrH 348F1 (Athenaios 13 [59 1 d] ). Athenaios 1 3 (591b) tells us that the people of Thespiai dedicated a statue of Phryne by Praxiteles at Delphi. Other sources name the sculptor himself or Phryne as the donor. The dedication aroused scandalized comment: Alketas, FGrH 405F1 (quoted by Athenaios); Plutarch, De Alexandři Magni Fortuna et Virtute 2.3 (336C-D )'De Pythiae Oraculis 14 (401A) and 15 (401D); A matorius 9 (753F); Pausanias 10.15.1. 3.

This would be roughly con- temporary with that by Praxiteles. Pausanias, however (9.27.3), says that the latter's work antedated the former's: could this have been the younger Lysippos?1 Another statue of Eros was dedicated by Phileinos son of Mondon, late in the first century A.D. or early in the second, at the same time as he paid for extensive repairs to the sanctuary.2 Pausanias is unable to give us a cult aition, which is interesting in itself. However, one is given by Konon, who derives the origin of the cult from the sad story of Narkissos. This is probably pure story-telling, connecting two well known Thespian names. The same was done in 125 A.D. by the emperor Hadrian in the epigram IG 7.1828. Erotideia Evidence for the Erotideia ranges from the second century B.C. to the third century A.D.3 Connections between the Erotideia and the Mouseia were often very close, as is clear not only from Plutarch and Päusanias,4 but also from inscriptions: there were times when the two agons shared the same agonothete, and on one occasion at least, the same victors' list.5 Presumably, therefore, at least on these occasions, and probably on others as well, the two agons were celebrated at the same time, or rather, consecutively. Both were pentaeteric. References in inscriptions to victories at the Erotideia concern athletes only, from which we may conclude that the Erotideia were athletic, and in fact the counterpart to the Mouseia.6 A number of victors' lists of / 1 . / Schol. Ludan, Adversus Indoctum 3, attributes the famous Eros of Thespiai to Alkamenes. He must mean Praxiteles. 2. IG 7.1 830. For the reading in BCH 26 (1902) 297.1 7, see EMPERORS (THESPIAI) p. 21 2 note 4. Although Pausanias does not state explicitly that there was a temple of Eros, it is obvious from his description of the monuments that there was. An attempt to repair this deficiency was made by A.N. Oikonomides, who, in Platon 12 (1960) 54, would add the following sentence to the very end of Pausanias 9.26.8 (the text here is decidedly corrupt): &lt; *♦* "Eon sé *** lepou * AippoÓirrję mi "Kptjroç mi vaos *** ev abrCb ***&gt;. 3.

After spending two or three days in the town philosophizing with his friends in the palaistras and theatres, he and the majority of them escape to Helikon and I lie Muses to get away from a quarrel among the kitharoidoi.

The only certain list, BCH 95 (1 97 1) 921 , breaks off in the midde of the gymnic victors (who begin the athletic section of the list).

A number of other victors' lists have a similar pattern of competitions, and I should think that they all dealt with the same agon. The overall pattern is that of gymnic followed by hippie victors, the former being divided into age categories: younger or "Pythie" boys, older or "Isthmic" boys, Ageneioi, Men (the significance of "Pythie" and "Isthmic" is discussed by T. Klee, Zur Geschichte der Gymnischen Agone an Griechischen Festen [Leipzig/Berlin 1918] 48): IG 7.1765 (gymnic: younger boys, older boys, ageneioi); 1769 (gymnic: Pythie boys, Isthmic boys, ageneioi, men); 1772 (gymnic: - - men; hippie); 1770 (gymnic: - - men); SEG 3.335 (gymnic: Pythie, Isthmic, ageneioi, men; hippie); 336 (gymnic: Pythie, Isthmic); 337 (gymnic: Isthmic); (perhaps IG 7.3548, from Plataia, which mentions an Isthmic victory). For the provenance of IG 7.1765, see my discussion of the Herakleia at Thebes, sv HERAKLES (THEBES). Too fragmentary to be of any use are IG 7.1767; 1768; 1771 (which may belong to the Mouseia).

Eunostos was a hero whose heroon and grove could not be entered or even approached by women.4 As his name suggests, Eunostos was an agricultural deity.5 His sanctuary may therefore have been in the countryside rather than within the city itself.6 A Tanagran bronze coin of imperial date depicts on the obverse, the bust of a youthful man, a crooked staff at his shoulder, and, perhaps, an ear of corn before him: could this be Eunostos?7 See EUONYMOS (TANAGRAIA). 1.

In so doing, they were continuing a ritual instituted by Herakles, in honour of his mother's friend, who had, by a ruse, hastened the hero's birth, and for her efforts been transformed into a weasel. In Ailian and Clemens Alexandrinus, it is the weasel which is so honoured.1 For the ritual and its possible significance, see HERAKLES (THEBES). 1. Other sources of the story do not mention any act commemorating the deed: Istros, FGrH 334F72 ( Schol .

Leonardos had discovered, at Skala Oropou, a number of inscriptions bearing dedications to the Nymph Halia.1 The published material, which seems to be additional to these, consists of two similar dedications to the nymph by successful choregoi of their prize tripods.2 These date from the fourth and fourth or third centuries B.C. A third inscription, restored by Petrakos as a dedication to the nymph, appears to be destined for another deity, probably Hermes (SEG 24.357). The coin, a bronze, depicts a female head on the obverse: she, Petrakos suggests, is Halia.3 Petrakos connects the Oropian Halia with the Rhodian sister of the Telchines, who cast herself into the sea and was renamed Leukothea.4 The choregic dedications obviously commemorate victories at an agon: the Amphiaraia, or another, local, one? 1.

Fr. 23b is part of the Iphigeneia story: the princess did not die, but was changed by Artemis into Hekáte. Once again, this is no evidence for cult.

Sake Ilario u , La Migration Grecque en Ionie (Athens 1958) 193 note 6, 194 note 1, 196 note 1. b) Some scholars take the Theban Hektor to be a figure of local cult: G.H. Macurdy, CQ 20 (1 926) 1 79 -1 80: "Hektor" is a shortened form of *Echelaos, a chthonic deity; the Theban Hektor was a god of the dead; but see P. Kretschmer, Giotta 20 (1932) 230, on the etymology; L. Ziehen, RE 5 A ( 1 934) sr 'Thebai" (1 ) 1515: Hektor could have been a Theban hero, brought to the Hellespont by migrating Boiotians, and subsequently identified with the Trojan Hektor; H.W. Parke and D.E.W. Wormell, The Delphic Oracle 1 (Oxford 1956) 349: perhaps a cult of prehistoric origin, "associated with the name of Hector by some later accretion of legend"; M.B. Sakellariou (cited above) 192-197, esp. 195-197: an early local hero, connected with the Chian Hektor. c) Others regard Hektor as having been imported into Thebes: L.R. Farnell (cited above) 328-329: perhaps at the time of the battle of Plataia; W.R. Halliday, Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology 11 (1924) 1 ff.: the cult of Hektor in the Troad led to the establishment of the Theban cult at a time when Boiotians were participating in Pontic colonization; M.P. Nilsson (cited above) 48: "In their war against the Locrians (sic) the Thebans had as much need of Hector's aid as had, e.g. the Spartans of the aid of Orestes whose bones they discovered at Tegea". d) L.A. Mackay, The Wrath of Homer (Toronto 1948) 80-81 : since both Thebes and Ilion were Epeirote or Illyrian cities, the two Hektors were in fact the same. There must be more interpretations, but these will suffice as a sample (see also M.B. Sakellariou 193-195). 233</page><page sequence="241">HEKTOR (THEBES) The earliest source - excepting "Aristotle"1 - is Lykophron, Alexandra 1204-1213, which belongs either to the first third of the third century B.C. or early in the second century, depending upon which view one espouses of the poem's authorship.2 The story is next mentioned by Aristodemos of Thebes, who seems to have written during the third quarter of the second century B.C.3 Both Lykophron and Aristodemos have Hektor's bones brought from Ophryneion in the Troad, where a grove of Hektor is attested by Strabo 1 3.1 .29 (595).4 If it is true that the bones - or other remains, real or fictional - of Hektor were brought from Ophryneion to Thebes, then an occasion must be sought. The literary evidence is hellenistic at the earliest (if we except the "Aristotelian" epitaph), and cannot go back far beyond the beginning of the third century B.C. or end of the fourth.5 The most important event in the life of Thebes at that time was the rebuilding of the city begun in 316 B.C. by Kassandros,6 to which contributions were made by various Greek states. An inscription from Thebes {IG 7.2419) has been ingeniously, and I think correctly, identified by M. Holleaux as a list of donations, secular and religious, by potentates and states, all destined for the rebuilding of Thebes.7 I cannot help wondering if the transfer of the bones of Hektor from Ophryneion to Thebes did not occur at this time, and was not in itself a manifestation of a contribution from the Troad to the restoration of Thebes (there may even have been an ironic ring of sympathy involved, with the heirs of the most famous sacked city of them all sending their champion to console the inhabitants of a city that had shared the fate of their ancestral home). In this connection, it is interesting to consider line 16 of IG 7.2419. The surviving text reads ]o)ba s õuaxaxuQjç. Holleaux restored: [ ' Avxuyoveues xot ex xãç Tp]a&gt;las ôuaxaxuoos.

It is possible, therefore, that the sanctuaries mentioned in this inscription were also consecrated to Hera Kithaironia.2 See HERA (PLATAIA), (THESPIAI). [HERA (HA LAI)] See [HERA (BOUMEIiTAIA)] .

HERA (LEBADEIA) Epithets: Basileia Basiiis Henioche ?Kore Inscriptions IG 7.3097 IG 9.1.98 Literature Pausanias 9.39.4; 9.39.5 Near the unfinished temple of Zeus Basileus was another temple, with images of Kronos, Hera, and Zeus.1 The inscription IG 7.3097 is one of a pair: it records a dedication to Hera Basilis and the polis by one Menandros son of Chresimos, ¿epriTeúaas neviaerriptóa, whose wife Paresia was a priestess.2 In the other inscription, IG 7.3096, of which only the first three lines survive, Menandros offers a dedication to Zeus Basileus.3 We may assume that husband and wife had held the priesthoods of Zeus Basileus and Hera Basilis respectively, and that Hera in this context was no more than the conventional consort of Zeus. In the inscription recording the treaty between Boiotia and Phokis, the gods before whom the oath is to be sworn include Zeus Basileus and Hera Basileia: these must be the same two.4 Päusanias, 9.39.5, reports that the hopeful consultant of Trophonios offers preliminary sacrifices ołutu) re xa) Tpo(pa)Vb(|) xai, tou Tpocpoavtou tous ïïauau, ïïpoç òè 'Aïïoààûjvu tg xa u Kpdvo) noti, All èïïùxÀritfLV BaauAeü nai, "Hpą Te 'Hvuóxfl nau AnyriTpu nv cïïovoyaçovTeç Eupojuriv tou Tpocpoovtou cpaauv ečvau Tpocpov.

The four deities by whom the oath is sworn are Zeus Basileus, Hera Basileia, Poseidon, and Athena. All of these had federal status in Boiotia at the time, Zeus and Hera because of the Basileia, Poseidon because Onchestos was the federal capital, and Athena because the Itoneion was the religious centre of the Boiotians. Athena in fact does double service here, as both the Boiotian Itonia and the Phokian Kranaia, at whose temple at Elateia the inscription was found. See L.

Taking Henioche to mean "charioteer" is both more obvious and more difficult to interpret. Perhaps it had to do with the Basileia?1 One other Hera has been suggested for Lebadeia, again from Pausanias. At 9.39.4 he writes: avaßäau ôè èïïù to yavxeüov xau auTo^ev uouauv ès to Ttpóaoo tou opous, Kopns cotl naAouyevn $npa/xaÀouyevri£ §npaç xaù Atos BaauÀeuiÇ vaos. 2 H.N. Ulrichs (cited by Hitzig in his apparatus ) suggested reading Kópns . . . xaÀouyevriS "Hpaç , giving a temple belonging jointly to Zeus Basileus and Hera Kore. This is accepted by P. Guillon,3 who sees this Zeus and Hera as a cult pair related to the Daidala. This may be so, but before accepting any emendation, one should try to see if any sense can be made of the majority tradition, Kopns ¿otl xaAouy evri dnpa • Assuming that this is what Pausanias wrote, we have "a place called the 'hunting-ground' of the Maiden". Who is the maiden? One is to hand, or perhaps two, namely Herkyna/Kore. Why should she be hunting? We are in fact told that Herkyna and Kore (if the two are not identical) were playing, and that Herkyna lost a goose, which Kore found beneath a stone in a cave (Pausanias 9.39.2-3). Presumably they searched for or hunted the goose. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that there was a place at Lebadeia, between the Trophonion and the hill on which the temple of Zeus Basileus was situated, called after this. Compare the Eúpya ' Avt Lyovns at Thebes (Pausanias 9.25.2).4 The problem is still insoluble, but at least the majority reading may be seen to be not entirely without justification.5 1. N. Yalouris, Mus.Helv. 7 (1950) 78-81, makes a great deal more out of Hera Henioche than the evidence will allow. In his hands, Henioche becomes "die Schutzgöttin der Schar und der böotischen Wagenlenker". Yalouris uses dis parate pieces of evidence with complete disregard of context. P. Guillon, Annales de la Faculté des Lettres et Sciences humaines d'Aix, Sér. class. 39 (1965) 53-66, takes Henioche as "charioteer", and associates this Hera with the Hera of the Daidala, who drove the cart. But in none of the aitia of the Daidala does Hera drive the cart (in any case it is a wagon, not a chariot). There is another peculiarity of this passage. Pausanias' words are Ove i ... o mriCov . . . At i eiríkkrioiv BaoiXei mi, "Hpņ re xHvi óxfl kūl Ar)fir¡Tpi r'v hnovoiiaÇovTeq Ebptjnriv. One is so accustomed to the idea of Zeus and Hera being grouped together that it is easy to overlook that what Pausanias seems to be saying is not "he sacrifices to Zeus Basileus and Hera Henioche and Demeter . . . Europe", but rather "he sacrifices to Zeus Basileus, and he sacrifices to Hera Henioche and Demeter . . . Europe". The conjunctions re and kcli seem to link Hera Henioche and Demeter Europe together as a pair. The inference is that at Lebadeia Hera may have been associated in worship with Demeter. Why this should be so is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is just Pausanias, being less than crystal clear. 2. See Hitzig 's apparatus for the actual variations, and see below, note 5. 3. P. Guillon, cited above, note 1. 4. For dr'pa as "hunting ground", see Dio Cassius 69.1 0.2, and Pausanias 3.20.5. 5. F.

It is tempting to connect this with the Hera of the Daidala, but the connection does not impose itself. The papyrus, which contains a commentary on Pindar's Isthmians (1.56 ff. at this point), refers to an agon connected with Minyas, and the celebration of Hekatomboia to Hera, but it is not certain whether this is a supposed ritual at Orchomenos or selsewhere.1 HERA (PLATAIA) Epithets: Gamelia Gamostolos Kithaironia Nympheuomene Teleia Rite: Daidala (Excavations and Site) AJA 1 (1891) 390-404 (H.S.

The wording is interesting: both the agon for Minyas and the Hekatomboia for Hera are introduced by hicet (eioetyàp in the case of the latter), which suggests that these were two separate entries. Pindar, in the passage being commented on, wrote of agons at Orchomenos, Eleusis, and Euboia. Perhaps the commentator's Hekatomboia were Euboian? But see E.

The Boiotian cults may also have been connected with or at least influenced by the cult of Hera at Perachora, just across the water: see HERA (CHORSIAI). 1. Herodotos 9.52-53; 9.61; 9.69; Plutarch, Aristeides 1 8.1 (329D-E). 2. The geographic distribution of these cults is repeated in those of Artemis huntress and the bi-form Demeter. Each of these three goddesses has as her province a different aspect of fertility: agricultural (Demeter), feral and human (Artemis), human (Hera). It is interesting to speculate on the possibility that they may all originally have been one single goddess, and on the implications of this. The further connection of Hera with the Kopais at Alalkomenai and elsewhere may not be basic to the cult. See below. 3. See P.

We can certainly deduce as much for the fifth century B.C. During the Peloponnesian War, Plataia was razed by the Thebans,1 who built next to the Heraion a katagogion, which must have been intended to house people who came from abroad to worship Hera; and wnen Euripides writes in Phoinissai 24 of Àeuy&amp;v ' és "Hpaç xaù Kudaup&amp;voç Àeïïaç , he must be referring to something familiar to his audience, namely that Kithairon, or part of it, was sacred to Hera.2 The celebration of the Daidala may also be commemorated in several types of more or less stylized female terracotta figurines from Boiotia of the sixth century B.C.: perhaps they represented the dolls dedicated to Hera.3 Originally the Heraion was situated ïïpo xris ïïoàloç.4 It is not certain that the sanctuary con- tained a temple before the hundred-foot one built by the Thebans after 427 B.C.:5 this was the building seen by Pausanias, with cult images by Kallimachos^ and Praxiteles (9.2.7). It is generally accepted that this temple was within the city walls when Pausanias saw it, having been enclosed when the walls were extended later: the foundations of a long narrow temple have been tentatively identified as the temple of Hera.7 1. Or the Spartans: Thucydides 3.68.3. See A.W. Gomme's comment ad loc, in A Historic Commentary on Thucydides 2 (Oxford 1962). 2. The Daidala, or at any rate the fire festival on Kithairon, may have been known to Aischylos and his contemporaries, if the interesting suggestion of J.H. Quincey -JHS 83 (1963) 128-129 - is correct. A festival of Hera Gamostolos forms part of the background for the version of the story of Oidipous related by Peisandros, FGrH 16F10, who locates Laios' and Oidipous* fatal encounter near Mount Kithairon. I do not know how early this version may be. 3. In many cases, the features and limbs are only crudely depicted.

Kardara, AJA 64 (1960) 347-350., esp. 350, suggests that the goddess on a Boiotian relief pithos could have been Hera, and that the pithos itself "could be explained as a vessel used in the cult of the Boeotian image of Hera".

Carettoni: 300). Of these, the second, the Athenian whose floruit was the last thirty years of the fifth century B.C., is the likeliest candidate. He is the only artist of that name mentioned by Pausanias elsewhere in his work (1.26.6 f.). His statue of Hera would presumably have been created some considerable time after the construction of the temple, when relations between Thebes and Athens were on a better footing. 7. H.S. Washington, AJA 7 (1891) 390-404: it seems to have been built over a layer of blackened earth. W.K. Pritchett, Studies in Ancient Greek Topography 1 (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1965) 119 note 68, notes that "the excavators did not attempt to reconcile the archaic features of the architectural proportions with their date of 426 B.C. As a rule, temples, once destroyed, were not reconstructed according to the original plan, but were rebuilt along new lines". There is in fact no hard evidence that this temple ever had a predecessor on the spot, and long narrow temples - that is, those of archaic type - are not uncommon in Boiotia, even after the archaic period: see J.M. Fossey, AJA 75 (1971) 201. 244</page><page sequence="252">HERA (PLAT AIA) It may seem odd that the Thebans should, after razing the city of their enemies, set about furnishing a hostel and temple for its major cult. However, there are at least two reasons why they might have done this: first, because of the festival, which drew participants from many parts, who had to be housed; second, it might be regarded as a political act, to counterbalance the temple of Athena Areia built by the Athenians. In later years, these two temples remained major landmarks at Rataia.1 The female head on Plataian coins of the fourth century B.C. has been identified as Hera. This seems reasonable enough. If it is meant to represent a statue of the goddess, then it must have been that by Kallimachos, not Praxiteles.2 The latter's statues of Rhea and Hera Teleia belong more readily to later in the century, after the reconstruction of the city. The Daidala3 It is possible to distinguish at least two different elements in the Daidala, one of which has a counterpart in Boiotia, the other in other parts of central and southern Greece. These are a log procession (in which a log, dressed as a woman, is borne in procession to a sanctuary), and a holocaust (in which the offerings are totally destroyed by fire). In the Daidala, the two are linked by having the pyre of the holocaust constructed in the manner of a building, that is, a temple (Pausanias 9.3.7).4 The log procession itself is explained in the aitia as a form of sacred marriage. It may have been so, although it is a strange marriage in which there is no bridegroom5 and in which the bride - the adorned log - is destroyed, unless we are to take the burning up of the image as a symbolic union of the goddess with the sky-god: but in this case, the log would have to represent Hera, and the whole point of the aitia is that it was not Hera. Again, the log procession may have been a kind of fertility magic, a maypole parade.6 This too is possible, but there is still another possibility, which alone adequately takes into account an important element of both the aition and the ritual. In Plutarch, the Tritonides nymphs bathe the log Daidale (fr. 157), 1. Poseidippos, fr. 29 Edmonds: a neat thumbnail sketch. 2. Numismatists tend to favour the statue by Praxiteles: see E. Babelon, F.W. Imhoof-Blumer and P. Gardner, and L. Lacroix, cited in the Testimonia. 3. This festival has been examined by many scholars.

The Daphnephoria - or rather that part of it which may be called the "Kopophoria" - must also belong to this type.3 The rites have several things in common, in addition to the fundamental one of a procession escorting an adorned log: 1) The Daidala occur at long intervals; the exact length of these is debatable (see below), but the essential thing is that there was an appreciable gap between one celebration and the next; the Daphnephoria, according to Proklos, was enneateric.4 2) The aition of both rites is.connected with the Kopais area, that of the Daphnephoria with the river Melas (and perhaps the region of Kopai: note the "Kopo") and the southern shore of the Kopais (that is, the north slopes of Helikon), that of the Daidala with Alalkomenai (see below). 3) In both cases the log is escorted by females: in the Daphnephoria, it is a chorus of maidens; in Pausanias' description of the Great Daidala (9.3.7) a woman is placed on the wagon bearing the lead Daidalon, to act as nympheutria (see Plutarch, fr. 157: Hera, in anger, rushes down from Kithairon in the company of the women of Plataia, and when the ruse is explained, consents to vuyipaycaye uv ) . There are, of course, differences between the rites, but these are more apparent than real: 1) In the Daphnephoria, the Kopo is a ÇúXov èAauaç , while the daidala are fashioned from the òpus 5 cut down in a ôpoyos/axeXex^ ôpufóv . As far as the Daphnephoria is concerned, there seems to be little internal consistency, the olive log being borne in a festival called the "Bearing of the Laurel", and brought to the sanctuary of a god whose consort is Melia, nymph of the ash tree. As for the daidalic òpus ? it may be worth noting Hesychios' gloss sv òpus • nav £uÀov xaí, ôevôpov . It is possible, considering the confusion in the case of the Daphnephoria, that the kind of wood was not important, but rather the adorning and bearing of it on the one hand, and the place the logs came from on the other. If the large copse nearest to Alalkomenai was one of oak trees, then oak trees it was.5 2) The Daphnephoria is a festival of Apollo, the Daidala a festival of Hera. In fact, the Daphnephoria is only awkwardly grafted on to the cult of Apollo at the Ismenion (and Galaxion): see APOLLO (THEBES) A. It is not the name of the deity that is important, but rather the rite itself. At Thebes, or more accurately, just outside Thebes, the procession was attached to the sanctuary of Apollo in the same way as other elements from outside Thebes proper were absorbed into the cult.6 3) There were several daidala, but only one Kopo. For an explanation of this, see below. 1. Pausanias 9.3.7. There is a textual problem here. The preceding sections deal with the procurement of fourteen xoana, and their distribution by lot among the participating towns. 9.3.7 then begins: tò 6e ayakßa Koa1ir¡aavTeq i rapa ròv * Aatjiròv mi avadêvreç erri &amp;ßa£av, ywa tica etpioraoL wynpevrpuLV oi óe avdiq ickripovvTai «ad * r'VTU&gt;a rà%u&gt; Tīļu īīOĻLiir'v aváÇovoL.

The participating states sacrificed cows to Hera, and bulls to Zeus, while individuals sacrificed animals according to their means,2 and all of these together with the daidala were burned up completely (Pausanias 9.3.7-8). The wholesale burning of sacrificial animals may be compared with similar rites known to have been held in the first and second centuries A.D., namely the Laphria at Patrai, and the festival of Isis at Tithorea; to these may be added the Elaphebolia and the Laphria at Hyampolis.3 Qearly it was not unusual for people in imperial Greece to round off a festival with a good bonfire, and this may be all there was to it. On the other hand, there may be more: the Laphria were a festival of Artemis, and Nilsson has suggested that Isis' predecessor at Tithorea may have been none other than Artemis Laphria. As for the Daidala and the holocaust there, it may be noted that Mount Kithairon was the home of Artemis Huntress, if not in cult, then at any rate in myth.4 Perhaps the holocaust of the Daidala was originally devoted to Artemis, and brought into the Daidala at some unspecified date: it would need little special pleading to combine with the worship of the patroness of marriage that of the patroness of childbirth. This might explain how Artemis' mother Leto came to be involved in the ritual and thence in the aition.5 In the rite as described by Pausanias, the "leading role" is played by only one of the images, that which is adorned, placed on the wagon with a woman to accompany it,6 and escorted from the Asopos. The other images, those allotted to the rest of the participating states, follow in an order determined by lot. It is my guess that originally only one image was involved, and that the others were added only later, when the festival assumed a "pan-Boiotian" character. Otherwise, why bother to select one image to lead the parade, and single it out for special treatment? At first sight, it appears that the pan-Boiotian Daidala could have been so organized during the latter part of the fourth century B.C.7 : the presence of Thebes in the list of major participating towns is connected with the restoration by Kassandros (Pausanias 9.3.6), and the interval of sixty years between Great Daidala with a period during which the Plataians were exiled (9.3.5): see below. 1. Fr. 157: mranavaa i 6 ' oucoç (sc. rhv *'H pav) avrò (sc. tò Çóavov) mí Trep &amp;'pvxov bv vnò ÇriXoTvmaç. 2. The text of Pausanias at this point (9.3.8) has been tampered with needlessly. It reads iStõmu 6c, biróoa Qvovoiv oi rrXovaioi , rofç 8è ob' oßoitos ótWjutç ra XeixTÒrepa tCjv npoßarojv Ove iv nadearriKe. ôiWjuç is changed by some editors to bvva ju(éi&gt;o)iç; but this is not necessary, since ôiW/luç can, especially in later Greek, mean "financial resources".

Nilsson, Griechische Feste (Leipzig 1906) 154-155 and 218-225. IG 9.1.90, from Hyampolis, records a dedication by a man who had been agonothete of the Megala Kaisareia, and (twice) of the Megala Elaphebolia and Laphria. Although the festivals are referred to here as agons, and presumably that was what they were at the time, the survival of the names Elaphebolia and Laphria is enough to assure us that they had existed at Hyampolis as religious festivals. 4. See AKTAION (KITHAIRON), ARTEMIS (KITHAIRON), and above, p. 243 note 2. 5. Plutarch fr. 157. See LETO (KITHAIRON). The concealment motif, here involving Zeus and Hera, recurs at Teumessos, with Zeus and Europe, and presumably at Lebadeia with Zeus and (Demeter) Europe. It may have a ritual base. Zeus, it should be noted, plays no role in the festival, appearing only in the aition as a necessary element in the drama. 6. As vvßipevrpui (9.3.7), a part played by Hera in Plutarch's second aition (fr. 157): abr r¡v (sc. rrp °Hpav) vvijupayuryeiv. 7. P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 1 04, who places the event during the period 338-315 B.C., writes of the list of towns given by Pausanias (9.3.6): "Ce sont les villes les plus importantes de Béotie, celles notamment qui élisent régulièrement un aphédriate: Thespics, Tanagra, Orchomène et Platées - et Thèbes après 315". On the date of the return of Thebes to the koinon, see R. Etienne and D. Knoepfler , BCH Supplément 3 (1976) 239 note 872. 247</page><page sequence="255">HERA (PL AT AI A) This seems reasonable enough, and I am quite content with the idea that there was such a re-organization of the festival along pan-Boiotian lines late in the fourth century. Indeed, I can think of a likely motive for it, and I think I can find an indirect reference to it as well. The motive may have been a patriotic desire to provide at Plataia a pan-Boiotian counterpart to the panhellenic Eleutheria, which, I believe, were initiated at this time: see ZEUS (PLATAIA). The indirect reference consists of etymologies and genealogies linking Plataia with the Kopais region1 : this could have been invented at a time when the Boiotian league, whose capital was at Onchestos, began to take an active interest in the Daidala. It might also explain the role played in the aitia by Alalkomenai: it was itself a venerable religious centre in Boiotia, and was, furthermore, near neighbour to the religious capital of the federation, the sanctuary of Athena Itonia at Koroneia.2 Although I find much to commend the hypothesis that the hellenistic Boiotian confederacy either made the Daidala into a federal festival, or reconsitituted the rite as such,3 I do not think that the actual towns listed by Pausanias can be historically accurate for the hellenistic period. In the first place , the number of daidala, fourteen, seems to be a fixed one, and it must have been so fixed when the koinon first took an interest in the Daidala. In the second place, if it is the hellenistic koinon that is in question, then the towns named as sufficiently important to merit a daidalon each are a strange collection indeed. They do, to be sure, include the major cities of Boiotia (Thebes, Tanagra, Thespiai, Orchomenos), but they also include some that were of lesser (Koroneia, Lebadeia) and others that were of still lesser importance (Plataia, Chaironeia), while they do not include towns like Haliartos and Akraiphia, which were flourishing in the hellenistic period. The relative prominence given to Plataia may easily be explained: the festival was, after all, held in Plataian territory and in honour of a Plataian goddess. The presence of Chaironeia in the list is instructive. If we recall that a major literary work on the Daidala was written by Plutarch of Chaironeia, then we might have an explanation for the presence of his home town in the list, and perhaps a date for the composition of the list. And, if we look at the remaining names - Thebes, Tanagra, Thespiai, Koroneia, Orchomenos, Lebadeia - we see that, with one possible exception, these are the Boiotian towns that were best known to other Greeks (that is, to Plutarch's potential readership) in imperial times: Thebes and Orchomenos for their legendary histories, Lebadeia for the oracle of Trophonios, Thespiai for the agons in honour of the Muses and Eros, Tanagra because it and Thespiai were the only really flourishing cities in Boiotia at the time.4 The apparent exception, Koroneia, finds a place in the list because it was still - or rather again - the religious centre of a Boiotian "koinon".5 1 .

On the Alalkomeneion in the hellenistic period, see ATHENA (ALALKOMENAI). At the Little Daidala, the tree to be cut down is the one on which a raven lands (Pausanias 9.3.4). Ravens and Boiotoi are also connected in Zenobios 3.87. 3. Could one of the functions of the federal college of aphedriates have been to take part in the direction of the Daidala? See P. Roesch, Thespies et la Confédération Béotienne (Paris 1965) 1 35-141. 4. Strabo 9.2.5 (403). 5. See ATHENA (KORONEIA). The absence of Haliartos, mentioned above, may be another indication that the list as we have it is a relatively late one, because Haliartos, which was very near the federal capital of Onchestos, was destroyed by the Romans in the second century B.C. If the list had been a hellenistic one, Haliartos ought to have been on it. 248</page><page sequence="256">HERA (PLATAIA) On balance, I would argue that Pausanias' list of participating towns does not go back any farther than Plutarch, or at any rate the first century A.D., and that it is an indication that the Daidala were probably reorganized at this time, perhaps even with the scholarly assistance of Plutarch himself. If I am correct in this, then I think that I may also be able to explain a problem which has vexed many people, namely that of the frequency of the Daidala. A great deal of ink has been spilt over the question of how often the Daidala were held. The major sourc is Päusanias. It is open to question if Menandr os Rhetor (Aa u ôaXa èv üXaxauaüs* ôu'èÇnxovxa yap èx&amp;v aye rau ) represents an independent tradition. He might have derived his information from Päusanias or some other contemporary source. Part of the problem is that Pausanias appears to contradict himself and indeed admits to being confused by the whole thing: 9.3.3. ("little" Daidala): Aa u ôaXa o')v ãyouauv oî üXaxaueus èopxnv ôu'è'xouç ègôóyou yev, ¿s è'cpaaxev ò xöv eu ux^pucov èÇnynxns, áXn$eu yevxou Xdyíp ôu'èXaaaovoç xau ou xoaoúxou xP°V0U# èdeXnoavxeç ôè aitò AauôaXcov ès AauôaXa exepa ávapudyñaau xòv yexaÇu xPÓV0V to axpußeaxaxov oûx èyevóyeda ouou xe. 9.3.5 (after describing the "Little" Daidala): xauxnv yèv ûôua ou IîXaxaueuç èopxnv ayouau, AauôaXa yuxpa óvoyáçovxeç' AauôáXu)V ôè èopxnv x&amp;v yeyaXojv xau Bol(ji)xol acpuau auveopxaçouau , ôu'èÇnxoaxou ôè ayouöLV exous* enXuTieuv yàp xoaouxov xpovov xnv èopxnv cpaouv, nvuxa ou nXaxaueus è'cpeuyov. 9.3.5: Çcîava ôè xeaaapeaKauôexa è'xouya acpuouv èaxu xax' èvuauxòv exaaxov uapaaKcuaodevxa èv AauôaXouç xous yuxpoug. The difficulty is obvious: if the Great Daidala were held every sixtieth year (i.e. every fifty-nine years), then the fourteen xoana got ready xax' èvuauxòv è'naaxov would have to be collected at intervals of something like four years (and even this would require us to take èvuauxóças meaning something more than a single year1). However, as the local authority told Pausanias, the little Daidala were held every seventh year (i.e. every six years), little wonder that he and Pausanias were unable to calculate the intervening periods èç xò anpugeoxaxov . I will not go into the various schemes that have been proposed to solve this riddle. The interested reader is directed to the bibliography above, p. 245 note 3. Pausanias seems to have derived his information about the Daidala almost completely from local sources. He may also have had access to a literary account, but this would have postdated Plutarch: the aition he gives, while it resembles Plutarch's second one, also contains elements of the first, and one may perhaps assume that there was some contamination. There is, indeed, nothing to contradict the assumption that Päusanias took the aition too from his local informant. 1 . See G. Murray, JHS 71 ( 1 95 1 ) 1 20, and compare P.

At any rate, one or the other or both were present at a celebration of the Great Daidala, and we may assume that the festival was celebrated at some time during the third quarter of the second century A.D., and that for some years before that occasion, oak trees were collected at intervals - whatever they were, regular or irregular - to the number of fourteen. We may be reasonably certain of this much, namely that there was at least one cycle of little Daidala and one Great Daidala in the second century A.D. But that is where certainty ends. We have no certain knowledge that the celebration of the Great Daidala described by Pausanias was one of a continuous series. Indeed, it is more likely, given the realities of economic and political life under the Empire, that the celebration of so elaborate a festival had lapsed at least once, to be revived late in the first century A.D. or early in the second. 1 This would have been long enough before the celebration of which Pausanias wrote to be regarded as having taken place "sixty years" before, that is, about two generations before.2 This, I think, is all that one can say about the frequency of the Daidala: it is making too much of the evidence to expect that it should be valid for all of antiquity. It suffices to say that the Daidala, when they were held, were traditionally held at long and perhaps irregular intervals.3 HERA (SIPHAI) See HERA (CHORSIAI). [HERA (THEBES)] Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 18 (587D) Schol Euripides, Phoinissai 24 The manuscripts of the Plutarch refer to a victory in the ' HpaCa at Thebes. This is usually emended to 'Hpa&lt;KXe&gt;ua, which I think is right. See HERAKLES (THEBES). The scholiast to Euripides suggests that there was a sanctuary of Kithaironia Hera at Thebes. Euripides, of course, was referring to the Kithaironian Hera on the mountain. See too HERA (THISBE). 1. U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen 1 (Berlin 1 931 ) 241 -242: "Wenn der Exeget von festen Intervallen von 60 Jahren redete, so war das höchstens soweit richtig, dass es jetzt von den letzten grossen Daidala so lange her war". 2. See, for example, D.W. Prakken, Studies in Greek Genealogical Chronology (Lancaster, Pa. 1 943) 1 -2; 8 ff. As J.G. Frazer points out (on Pausanias 9.3.5), the equation of the sixty years with the period of exile fits neither that of 427-387 B.C., nor that of 373-338. 3. I have not so far mentioned the two inscriptions. IG 7.48 refers to a victory in an agon called Heraia: no agon of this name is known in Boiotia. The inscription AJA 7(1 891 ) 406-421 is an inventory of offerings by women. No deity is named. Hera is possible, so are Demeter or Artemis, and a variety of others. 250</page><page sequence="258">HERA (THESPIAI) - [HERA (THISBE)] HERA (THESPIAI) Epithet: Kithaironia Arnobius, Adversas N añones 6.11 Gemens Alexandrinus, Protreptikos 4.46.3 (40P) The people of Thespiai in olden days worshipped "ramum pro Cinxia" (Arnobius). Clemens adds more: notu xrís Kudaupcovuas "Hpaç év Oeaueua Ttpeyvov ¿xnexoyyevov . The identification of Hera/Juno by her epithet Cinxia - goddess of marriage - is revealing. It is clear both from this and from Clemens that we are dealing with the same goddess as that of the Daidala, who was worshipped at Thespiai as well, but took her epithet from the major cult centre.1 The Heraion at Chorsiai, and possibly others at Kreusis and Siphai, was frequented by Thespians. Clearly there was a connection among these sanctuaries.2 It would help if there were more evidence: a single inscription from Thespiai would work wonders. In the meantime, one can only speculate on the possibilities, for example, that each of these towns, or all of them together for that matter, may have had their own "Daidala", independent of the Plataian one. See HERA (CHORSIAI), (PLATAIA). [HERA (THISBE)] Schol. Euripides, Phoinissai 24 N.

Unless the (common?) source of Arnobius and Clemens confused Thespiai with Plataia. It is possible, I suppose, that the term "Thespiai" was used to include all of southern Boiotia, at least under the Empire. 2. The Thespian Heraion need not have been in the town itself, it could have been the one mentioned in the inscription from Chostia ( SEG 24.361).
