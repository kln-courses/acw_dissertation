ISBN: 978-1-58983-122-3. doi: 10.101 7/S0009840X07001977 Allegory was probably one of the earliest forms of literary criticism, and may well have arisen to defend Homer against attacks such as that of Xenophanes, who complained that Homer (and Hesiod) attributed to the gods all the reproaches and faults of men, including theft, adultery and deception. The first of such defenders was said to have been Theagenes of Rhegium (sixth century B.C.), who allegedly initiated the allegorical interpretation of the Homeric poems, explaining, for instance, that the battles of the gods represented the opposition of elements or qualities such as dry and wet, hot and cold, heavy and light, fire and water. Apollo, Helius and Hephaestus symbolise fire, Poseidon and Scamander water, Artemis the moon, Hera the air. Similarly with abstract qualities: Athena represents wisdom, Ares folly, Aphrodite desire and Hermes reason. Other early thinkers who are said to have applied allegorical methods to Homer include Metrodorus of Lampsacus and Pherecydes. But it was Plato's denunciation of Homer that had the greatest impact on the development of allegorical interpretations of myth and poetry. Stoic philosophers and scholars from Zeno onwards seem to have been particularly keen to defend Homer against Plato's censures, and the allegorical interpretation of anthropomorphic gods is a feature of Stoic criticism. Two such critics, Apollodorus of Athens and Crates of Mallus, are referred to by the Heraclitus who is the author of The Classical Review vol. 58 no. 1 (D The Classical Association 2008; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 93 Homeric Problems concerning What Homer Has Expressed Allegorically in Respect to the Gods. Nothing is known of Heraclitus, and his work cannot be firmly dated (the turn of the first and second centuries A.D.?) but, as its full title suggests, it belongs to the tradition of defending Homer. Plato is duly cited as a key figure in the debate: 'Away too with Plato, the flatterer, Homer's dishonest accuser, who banishes him from his private Republic as an honored exile, garlanded with white wool and with his head drenched with costly perfumes!' Heraclitus proceeds with a systematic defence of Homer's depiction of the gods, beginning with Book 1 of the Iliad, and ending with the slaying of the suitors at the close of the Odyssey. Of particular interest are the brief theoretical statements in the opening chapters on the nature of allegory, which Heraclitus defines, with reference to the word itself (aAAa = 'other', ayopEV'ELv = 'say'), as 'the trope which says one thing, but signifies something other than what it says'. As examples of allegory he quotes passages from Archilochus, Alcaeus and Anacreon, and claims that 'the trope of allegory' is familiar to all other writers as well as Homer. This definition belongs to rhetorical theory, and is clearly much broader in scope than the specific use of exonerating Homer from charges of impiety to which Heraclitus puts it. But it also suggests that allegory had an importance in ancient literary criticism which, until recently, has been generally overlooked. As Donald Russell has pointed out, 'The long and complex history of ancient allegorical interpretation ... has to do with the history of religion and ethics more than with that of literary criticism' (Criticism in Antiquity [Duckworth, 1981], pp. 95-6). Symptomatic of this is the fact that this new translation of Heraclitus, the only extended example of allegorical criticism and the only large-scale treatise on Homer to have survived from antiquity, comes to us courtesy of The Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta. This is the first English translation of the text (though there is a translation into French by F. Buffiere, 1962), and Russell and Konstan have done a superb job. The translation, lucid and readable, is accompanied by a facing Greek text with minimal critical apparatus, brief notes and an excellent introduction which discusses, amongst other things, the role of allegory in ancient literature and thought, the status of Homer in the classical world and the intellectual background to Heraclitus' treatise. Allegory, for so long neglected by critics of ancient literature, is now firmly back on the map, and this volume provides an ideal introduction to the subject.
