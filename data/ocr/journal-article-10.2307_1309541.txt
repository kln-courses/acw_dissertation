The many dia- grams showing costs and benefits of par- ticular behaviorial or ecological prob- lems make the text even more understandable. In general, definitions of terms are adequate, although I take exception to the authors' defining ecology as "evolu- tion in action"; for the truly beginning student, this definition would hardly be adequate. There is a good discussion, however, of how ecologists often use anthropomorphic terms (e.g., "breeding strategies") as a type of shorthand for more complex evolutionary concepts. The authors necessarily had to make some choices of both topics to be dis- cussed and ideas presented under each topic. Topics omitted that I would have liked to see include: behavior during the nonbreeding season (not just migration), mate selection, parent-young interac- tions, and habitat (including nest site) selection. Similarly, there are subjects that might have been discussed within the broad topics covered that were not, specifically: age effects (under mating strategies and foraging), importance of critical resources such as nutrients (un- der foraging), and display sites (under territory). Nonetheless, for a text aimed at a general audience, this book is ade- quate and even presents an exciting pic- ture of the field. For nonamateurs the book presents a few problems, however. For example, although it is difficult to imagine what an advanced undergraduate really knows about avian ecology, I found some of the descriptions and discussions oversimpli- fied, possibly giving the student the im- pression that ecological phenomena are PRIMATOLOGY AT CAMBRIDGE Primate Social Relationships: An Inte- grated Approach. Robert A. Hinde. Sin- auer Associates, Sunderland, MA, 1983. 384 pp., illus. $40.00 (cloth), $21.00 (paper). Probably no one has done more to further our knowledge of primate behav- ior-through his own research and the training and nuturing of students-than Robert Hinde. This book is a showcase for much of that work with students and close associates at Cambridge. If primatologists are to grapple with clear-cut and easy to study. Territoriali- ty, for example, is discussed in terms of economic defensibility-the cost and benefit of the system to the individual. Mere cost-benefit analysis may not com- pletely explain territoriality, since some aspects relating to energy constraints are not included in the analysis. Birds may select a territory based on its adequate display sites for attracting mates, avail- able cover for chicks, or optimal nesting density for adequate predator defense. These factors are not necessarily mea- sured by energy constraints. The authors' discussion of the center- edge effect in colonial nesting birds (cen- ter-nesting birds produce more young) also oversimplifies this concept, compli- cated by many other factors including age; many authors have failed to find a center-edge effect at all. Indeed center- edge effects may be entirely due to other factors, resulting only from age, particu- lar predators, or some other aspect of colony structure. Unfortunately, winter territoriality, a case where optimality theory is particularly useful, is not ade- quately discussed. In their discussion of breeding timing, Perrins and Birkhead imply that early nesting birds are more successful, giving examples to support this viewpoint. In fact, however, there are many examples of mid-nesting birds that raise more young and even a few examples of late- nesting pairs being most successful. When birds are most successful depends upon many factors, including weather conditions, food availability, and preda- tors during each breeding season. For the North American reader, the book may contain too many examples from Europe. In many instances it would have been more appropriate to use ex- amples from both the Old and the New key issues and if findings are to generate principles of wider applicability, Hinde argues, then more than additional facts about monkeys and apes is needed. Pri- matologists need a conceptual frame- work, one yielding "an ordered body of knowledge-a science of social behav- ior." For full understanding, contends Hinde, social behavior must be studied at several levels, including individual be- havior, relationships, and social struc- ture, for at each level "emergent proper- ties" not apparent at lower levels may surface. Behavioral explanations should interweave considerations of causation, Worlds. Both authors have more experi- ence with European species, of course, but even the advanced ornithology un- dergraduate student in North America would have little knowledge of these Old World species. And one more minor flaw-I note that there are 14 references by Lack and 5 by Coulson, but only 5 by MacArthur, 1 by Trivers, and none by Niko Tinbergen. Surely avian ecology has been greatly influenced by Niko Tin- bergen, who published some of the first and classical studies on territoriality, co- loniality, and antipredator behavior. Nonetheless, these authors are to be commended for producing a beginning avian ecology book useful for a wide array of people. Professionals will find the text valuable as a brief summary of the ideas, theories, and research in cur- rent avian ecology. Amateurs will find a readable and enjoyable account of the evolutionary approach to birds, and ad- vanced undergraduates will get a good introduction to some of the problems in avian research today. Perrins and Birk- head discuss some complicated topics (resource-based polygyny, ideal-free dis- tributions, coevolution, ultimate and proximate factors) but in a manner al- lowing most readers to understand them. Their use of tables summarizing advan- tages and disadvantages of behavior pat- terns such as coloniality, group foraging, and specific mating systems is also help- ful. All in all, I highly recommend this book to amateurs, advanced undergradu- ates, beginning graduate students, and professionals who want to get a broad overview of this research area.

This holistic perspective, a welcome al- ternative to the reductionism of early social deprivation research, underscores the need for sociobiologists to avoid oversimple models of genetic determin- ism for individual behavior within pri- mate social groups. Hinde has champi- oned these views for years, and the combined research efforts of the 21 con- tributors to this volume come closer than ever before to realizing many of these goals. Most of the authors have contributed several sections to one or more of the November 1984 653</page><page sequence="2">book's 13 chapters. Although many chapter sections briefly summarize pre- viously published studies, others present new data, largely from recent Ph.D. dis- sertations at Cambridge. I sometimes found the brevity of these sections dis- tracting; data are often expressed as number of behaviors per unit observa- tion time, as ratios of an event's occur- rence relative to some other event's fre- quency, and indices combining various behavioral counts or durations. Such presentations may have their conceptual advantages, but they can also be difficult to interpret. The book focuses almost completely on three species of Old World mon- keys-the rhesus macaque, vervet mon- key, and savannah baboon-that live in multimale-multifemale troops with social dominance hierarchies. Hinde suggests that such a limited but detailed survey, rather than producing a myopic view of primate social behavior, permits in- depth coverage and a synthesis of gener- al principles possibly applicable to other species. Moreover, the nonspecialist is spared having to learn the natural history of too many species. This approach is reasonable as long as the reader is not lulled into thinking that every finding from these studies generalizes to all non- human primate species, or even to all closely related species, or for that mat- ter, even to other study populations. In describing social behavior, Hinde notes that the content, diversity, quali- ties, relative frequencies, and patterning of behavior are all important in relation- ships. For example, in rhesus monkeys, "strong" and "weak" sibling and peer relationships are distinguishable by a grooming criterion and, along with kin- ship, appear to influence a number of friendly interactions. Individual differences are also impor- tant. Stevenson-Hinde finds that person- ality differences in the Madingley rhesus colony are predictable over time and across different situations, especially in females. Context, too, affects social rela- tionships, as Lee points out in describing context-specific unpredictability in dom- inance interactions among immature ver- vet monkeys. Lower-ranking individuals apparently fare better when competing for grooming partners than for food re- sources, suggesting that immatures may be more motivated to take risks for ac- cess to grooming partners than for food. Age, sex, rank, kinship, and familiar- ity influence relationships as well. For example, although young female yellow baboons are more solicitous of male at- tention, the males do not seem to direct more social or sexual behavior toward them (Rasmussen). In the Madingley col- ony, an infant rhesus monkey's sex af- fects both the mother-infant relationship and the mother's subsequent reproduc- tion (Simpson). Also, lower-ranking mothers tend to have sons rather than daughters and are therefore less likely to suffer the high rates of aggression associ- ated with having a daughter. Data from other colonies will be important to fur- ther document such intriguing findings. Although sections on the development and dynamics of relationships are partic- ularly insightful, throughout the book I would have liked more references to literature showing interspecific differ- ences. For example, male and female Japanese macaques with close bonds outside the mating season tend not to form sexual consortships (Enomoto 1978, J. Human Evol. 7: 283-293; Taka- hata 1982, Primates 23: 1-23); in ba- boons, however, only the females seem to distinguish between males with whom they have close nonbreeding bonds and those with whom they do not when choosing sexual partners. Without some coverage of the literature, we get too uniform a view of some aspects of pri- mate social relationships. The complex interplay of individual behavior, relationships, and social con- text comes out in two chapters focusing primarily on mother-infant interactions. Rhesus monkey mothers seem to exert less influence on their infants as the infants grow older (Stevenson-Hinde). Both Hinde and Berman discuss the ef- fects of other social companions on in- fant development, Berman focusing on differences among infants associated with the presence of kin. Lee presents preliminary data suggesting that birth of an infant vervet monkey may abruptly change the relationship between a moth- er and her previous offspring. Hooley and Simpson also report that, in the Madingley colony of rhesus monkeys, having an older sibling discourages in- fant independence and makes mothers of males more restrictive. Differences in the mother-infant relationship are thus due not only to differences among moth- ers but to the presence of siblings, whose influence can be both direct and mediat- ed through the mother. In another sec- tion on vervet monkeys, Lee notes that a number of factors, including maternal dominance rank and kinship, influenced friendly contacts with infants by group members. Among the proximate factors influenc- ing social structure, dominance status and kinship are particularly important and may, along with familiarity, account for the distribution of grooming. Sey- farth believes that grooming is a social tool used by monkeys to establish and maintain those social bonds returning the greatest benefit. Schulman suggests the potential use of mathematical blockmo- dels for describing social structure, an idea that he and Mary Pearl have ex- panded upon elsewhere (Advances in the Study of Behavior 13). Lee further notes how details of social structure may not always be stable, depending on influ- ences of the immediate environment and varying group composition. Intergroup relationships, including home range and territory patterns, ag- gressive encounters with other groups, and male emigration are considered by Lee and Cheney. Some of these topics are presently at only a preliminary level of understanding, but it is clear that individual and sex differences are promi- nent and important in intergroup relationships. A chapter on the ultimate factors that may determine individual and social strategies and relationships was particu- larly stimulating. In comparison to earli- er chapters, which largely offer conclu- sions stemming directly from data, this one is more speculative. Datta, in partic- ular, provides a useful frame of reference for patterns of agonistic interference among rhesus monkeys, taking into ac- count factors such as relatedness, the roles and identities of participants, and the costs of interference. The book concludes with a chapter on the relevance to other species of the questions asked and the methods applied in earlier sections to rhesus macaques, vervet monkeys, and baboons. Not all specific findings extend to other pri- mates (Dunbar, Harcourt and Stewart), although some, such as the importance of matrilineal kinship in social relation- ships, are applicable to nonprimate spe- cies such as the elephant (Moss and Poole). If analyses of social relationships in other species are done with the preci- sion and elegance of most studies de- scribed in this book, we will soon know a great deal more about principles govern- ing mammalian social behavior.
