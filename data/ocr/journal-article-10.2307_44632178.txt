Huijskens TNO Crash-Safety Research Centre Delft, The Netherlands ABSTRACT The cervical spine of young children is normally very mobile. Consequently, relatively little force is re- quired to cause subluxation of the cervical vertebrae. In this respect, the incidence of cervical spine injuries in children involved in car accidents seems to be sur- prisingly low. However, recent European data seem to indicate that serious cervical spine injuries occur more frequently than had previously been thought. In particular, small children seated in forward facing re- straint systems with a harness belt appear to be at risk from tetraplegia in moderate frontal impacts. To investigate the significance of these findings, TNO has undertaken a research programme to mea- sure the neck loads induced in TNO-P3/4 child dum- mies seated in various types of restraint system. A series of dynamic sled tests has been performed in which the neck loads induced in a TNO dummy have been measured using a special transducer, which re- places the Atlas-Axis block of the dummy. The design of this transducer and the test results that have been obtained to date are discussed in detail in the present paper. Special attention is focused on how the mis- use of restraint systems can affect neck loads, and on the influence of different seating positions. In addition, consideration is given to the significance of free flexu- ral/ extensional motions of the P3/4 head. Finally, for- ward facing and rearward facing systems are com- pared with each other and child dummy neck loads contrasted with proposed adult tolerance limits. In parallel with the experimental work, a series of mathematical simulations has been performed, using the MADYMO CVS programme. These analyses have been aimed at studying the effect of chin-to-chest contacts and assessing the impact of head/neck joint characteristics on neck loads. A "Design of Experi- ments" programme allowing systematic parameter variations has been used to analyse the significance of various test and design parameters. THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN in passenger cars is an important area in the field of passive safety. Parents, product designers, legislators and resear- chers have a special duty to this vulnerable group of road users, since young children are not able to make judgements about safety themselves. Severe injuries not only have implications for children and their families in the longer term, but they also place a considerable burden on society. In the last 10 years, there have been substantial improvements in the design of child restraint systems. Accident investigations in Europe have shown that there are significant advantages in using child restraint systems. Langwieder and Hummel [1JO, for instance, found that for unrestrained children, the risk of serious/fatal injuries is seven times higher than for restrained children. However, their accident data also indicated the occurrence of serious neck injuries in young children restrained by forward facing systems. At a workshop on child safety in 1986 [2], attended by some 100 experts in this field, serious neck injuries were not considered to be important since they were rarely observed in the accident data available at that time. This view was given further credence by Carlsson et al. [3], who concluded that serious neck injuries were very rare and that in the case of restrain- ed children, only 0.9% were within the AIS 2-6 range. Langwieder and Hummel [1] reported that neck injuries rank second to head injuries for restrained children. Of all the injuries reported for restrained children, 14% appear to be AIS class 1 neck injuries and 1% AIS class 5. No serious neck injuries were found in comparable data for unrestrained children. Using these results as a basis, Langwieder and Hummel carried out further research in Germany to investigate the extent to which children using restraint systems sustained serious neck injuries in car acci- dents. In a recent paper [4], they reported on 5 cases * Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper 2093</page><page sequence="2">of tetraplegia. Four of the children injured in this way were restrained in systems with a 4-point harness belt, when the cars in which they were travelling became involved in 'moderately severe' head-on collisions. News of these cases led to the advantages and dis- advantages of forward facing versus rear facing child restraint systems being discussed in Europe. It was felt that such cases could not be ignored even though the frequency of serious neck injuries in children appeared to be very low. Moreover, there was agree- ment that more attention should be given to studying these incidents as this could ultimately lead to better products and improved legislation. OBJECTIVE In an attempt to address these issues, the TNO Crash-Safety Research Centre started a research programme in 1990 aimed at studying the neck loads induced in small children involved in traffic accidents and assessing the effect of different types of restraint system. At the outset, it was realized that a certain number of difficulties would be encountered, because little was known about child injury tolerance limits, and biofidelic dummies capable of representing very young children were not available. It was therefore decided that in the first phase of the programme, these points would need to be addressed and that in addition, particular attention would need to be focused on the development of neck load transducers which would be compatible with child dummies. This led to the following aims being drawn up for the first phase of the research programme: - to evaluate current knowledge about cervical spine injuries in children; - to develop and evaluate a neck load transducer suitable for child dummies; - to perform dynamic sled tests using several types of child restraint system (including forward facing and rear facing systems) and to compare the measured neck loads; - to perform dynamic sled tests in which several test parameters (including misuse of the restraint system) are varied and to analyse their effect on the measured neck loads; - to evaluate the head-neck response of the TNO- P3/4 child dummy; - to model the test set-up, perform simulations and analyse the head-neck kinematics and induced loads; - to use a Design of Experiments programme in order to assess the effect of the test parameters on the measured neck loads. A summary of the results obtained in this part of the research programme is contained in the present paper. CERVICAL SPINE OF CHILDREN GENERAL-As a precursor to the experimental programme, a limited literature survey was carried out, which reviewed specific themes such as the anatomical differences between the cervical spine of children and adults, traumatic cervical spine injuries in children, and biomechanical research concerning tolerance limits and dummy/cadaver comparisons. ANATOMY-The vertebral column is the flexible axis of the human body and is composed of (see Figure 1): - the cervical spine (7 vertebrae); - the thoracic spine (1 2 vertebrae) ; - the lumbar spine (5 vertebrae); - the sacral (5 fused) and coccygeal (4 fused) vertebrae. Figure 1. Side view of vertebral spine showing the seven cervical vertebrae. 2094</page><page sequence="3">It can be seen from the figure that the spine has an S-shape and the cervical spine is bent backwards (i.e. lordosis). The first ('atlas') and second ('axis') cer- vical vertebrae have a special function. These ele- ments form the joint which allows the head to be flexed and to be extended, and provides for (lateral) rotation. The anterior side of the cervical vertebrae appears to be angled downwards. In young children, the cervical spine is normally very mobile [5, 6, 7, 8]. The laxity of the major liga- mentous structures of the infant spine and the poorly developed musculature allow an unusual degree of spine mobility. For example, anterior subluxation (i.e. forward displacement) of up to 4 mm at the C2/3 or C3/4 level may occur as a normal variant. This is often called pseudo-subluxation. This anatomic-physiolo- gical hypermobility of the upper cervical spine is found in children up to 7 years old. Teng [5] and Weiss [6] reported a forward displacement of the C2 vertebrae relative to the C3 vertebrae in 25% of normal children between 1 and 7 years old. Another reason for hypermobility of the cervical spine in young children is the fact that the articular facets (i.e. joints between the vertebrae) are oriented in a more horizontal plane than observed in the adult cervical spine [5, 7, 8]. The more 'vertical' adult orientation does not develop before the age of eight. Consequently, subluxation can occur with surprisingly little force [7]. However, as there is a considerable amount of free space around the spinal cord, this need not pose an immediate problem. An average cord diameter of 7 to 13 mm is common in the upper cervical region, whereas the canal through the vertebrae has an average diameter of 25 to 30 mm [9, 10], INJURIES-lt appears from medical literature that the incidence of cervical spine injuries in children is surprisingly low. Teng [5] reported three such cases at his hospital over a period of 10 years. Similarly, Gaufin and Goodman [7] treated only three infants with cervical spine and spinal cord injuries at their hospitals over a 5-year period. Henrys et al. [8] reported 1299 traumatic lesions of the vertebral spine in one Detroit hospital over a 20-year period. Among the 631 cervical lesions, only 12 patients were under 15 years of age (i.e. 1.9%). A search of the medical records at Children's Hospital in Detroit, revealed no more than 5 cases during a 4-year period. Henrys et al. [8] concluded that cervical spine injuries in children are generally located in the C1-C4 region, whereas the C4-C7 region appears to be more common in adults. Cervical spine injuries and especially fractures of the bony parts appear to be very often associated with head injuries [5, 6, 7, 9, 1 1 , 12]. The reported cervical injuries can generally be categorized as 'subluxation' and 'fracture-dislocation'. A 'subluxation' is a mild shift of one vertebral body relative to the subjacent or superjacent vertebral body, which causes the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal to be altered. A 'dislocation' is a complete disruption of normal contact between the articular surfaces of two (or more) vertebrae. Under such cir- cumstances, the posterior ligament is the main stabilizing factor. A fracture-dislocation' includes an actual fracture and accounts for the most severe neurological complications. In children up to 2 years old, injuries to the cer- vical spine are very rare [8]. Obstetrical complications constitute the principle cause. Ligamentous laxity permits a longitudinal force to separate adjacent vertebral bodies sufficiently to cause total anatomical transection of the cervical spinal cord, without apparent fracture-dislocation of the spine. For children between 3 and 5 years old, falls and automobile accidents were found to be the main causes. Henrys et al. [8] concluded from their study that the incidence of cervical spine injuries in children younger than 15 was surprisingly low. They thought that this could be partially explained by the fact that this age group was less at risk from industrial and automobile accidents. Their study focused on the period 1953-1973. In the intervening years, the number of vehicles on the road has increased considerably and at the same time, re- straint systems for child car occupants have been in- troduced. Nevertheless, serious cervical spine injuries in children still appear to be relatively rare [1 , 2, 3, 4]. More recently, after hearing of the cases reported in Germany [4], it was decided to establish an inter- national working party in France to consider the sig- nificance of these findings. To date, the working party has identified at least 11 cases with severe cervical lesions [13]. The delta-V of these head-on collisions (10 to 2 o'clock) was between 30 and 60 km/h. The children were between 7 and 23 months old and mostly female. They were all restrained in forward facing systems with 4-point or 5-point harness belts, while the restraint systems were attached to the cars with 2-point belts. In most cases, the lesion occurred at the C1-C2 level. BIOMECHANICAL DATA-Reviews on injury tolerance data for children are given by Sturtz [14] and Dejeammes [15]. In general, three methods can be distinguished for developing such tolerance data: - analysis and reconstruction of real accidents; - scaling of adult tolerance data; - biomechanical tests with surrogates. An example of the first approach is that adopted by Foust et al. [16], who analysed and reconstructed a set of well-documented free fall accidents. Several authors have reported scaling techniques for biomechanical data. Fayon [17] and Sturtz [14] 2095</page><page sequence="4">applied such techniques to develop tolerance data for children on the basis of adult data. Tolerance levels for the adult cervical spine are proposed in ref. [18]. Limits of 190 Nm (flexural) and of 57 Nm (extensional) have been suggested for the bending moment measured on a 50th percentile male dummy. The proposed maximum shear and maximum tensile loads for adults appear to be dependent on the duration of the load application (see Figure 2) [18]. 6 - I 1 4^ ¿ [0,3K S (33.2.9ÎS. 2 (37,1 .spy (25,1*5) ^ (30,1.1) (45,1.1) O' ■' » i i » 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 DURATION OF LOADING OVER GIVEN FORCE LEVEL (ms) Figure 2. Proposed cervical spine force-time limits for adult injury assessment [ 18]. Biomechanical tests using child cadavers as human surrogates have been reported in refs. [15, 19, 20]. Comparison of the behaviour of the TNO 3-year old dummy and the USA Part 572 3-year old dummy in a child restraint system with a harness belt showed that the response of the TNO dummy was far closer to that of a child cadaver tested in a similar system [20, 21]. This was thought to be due to the greater flexibility of the lumbar spine and neck of the TNO dummy and was cited as the reason for the larger downward movement of the dummy's head. Kallieris et al. [19] also concluded that the flexibility of the Part 572 3-year old dummy spine was insufficient when compared with child cadavers. It is important to note that none of these studies addressed the issue of either measuring or calculating neck loads. It can therefore be concluded that the general level of knowledge in this field is still rather limited. SLED TESTS GENERAL-The main purpose of the experimental part of the programme was to compare the neck loads induced in forward facing and in rear facing child restraint systems, and to analyse the effect of various test parameters on the measured neck loads. Well- defined test procedures were strictly adhered to throughout the experimental phase. The test equipment used in the experimental programme was commensurate with the European regulation for child restraint systems ECE-R44 [22]. More detailed information about the test conditions, the child restraint systems and the design and instrumentation of the child dummy is given below. GENERAL TEST SET-UP-The child restraint systems included in the programme were subjected to a dynamic test at an impact speed of 50 km/h (forward impact) or 30 km/h (rearward impact). The sled tests were carried out in accordance with the specifications of ECE Regulation 44 - Child restraint systems [22]. Both forward facing and rear facing restraint systems were secured to the sled seat with a standard seat belt according to Annex 13 of the ECE Regulation. All tests were carried out in duplicate. The sled velocity and sled deceleration were recorded during the tests and high speed films made to analyse the dummy kinematics. CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS-The tests were carried out with three different types of universal child restraint systems: - a forward facing seat with 4-point harness belt, re- strained to the sled by a 2-point belt (see Figure 3); Figure 3. Child restraint system; forward facing 4-point harness belt and 2-point car belt. - a forward facing seat with an impact shield, re- strained to the sled by a 2-point belt (see Figure 4); Figure 4. Child restraint system; forward facing impact shield and 2-point car belt. 2096</page><page sequence="5">- a rearward facing seat with a 4-point harness belt, restrained to the sled by a 3-point belt (see Figure 5). Figure 5. Child restraint system; rearward facing 4-point harness belt and 3-point car belt. The forward facing systems are suitable for children in Weight Class I of ECE-R44 (i.e. body weights of 9 to 18 kg) [22]. The third system is suitable for use as a rear facing or forward facing system for the respective weight classes Class 0 (i.e. &lt; 10 kg) and Class I. In this programme, the latter system was solely used as a rearward facing system. All of the systems are suitable for use with the TNO P3/4 child dummy. CHILD DUMMY-From the accident data presented above, it is apparent that children of about 1 year old are vulnerable to cervical spine injuries. Since no dummies are currently available for children of this particular age, the TNO-P3/4 child dummy was selected for inclusion in the present programme. This dummy represents a child of 9 months old and is prescribed in the European regulation for child restraint systems ECE-R44 [22]. The total body weight of the P3/4 dummy is 9 kg and the sitting height is 45 cm. Figure 6 shows an exploded view of this dummy. The TNO dummy consists of 14 main segments: a head, a neck (vertebrae and spine cable), an upper torso, a lower torso, an abdominal insert, a lumbar spine (vertebrae and spine cable), two upper arms, two forearms (including hands), two upper legs and two lower legs (including feet). To allow for realistic motions, ball-and-socket joints have been used for the hip and shoulder, and hinge joints for the elbows and knees. The head is made of polyurethane rubber reinforced with a steel strip. The neck is composed of a core of polyamide inner elements (Part 1 in Figure 6), a polyamide Atlas-Axis block (Part 2 in Figure 6) and a series of polyurethane outer elements (Part 3 in Figure 6), which fit around the inner elements. The spine cable, which can be adjusted by a nut on top of the Atlas-Axis block, runs through these vertebral elements. The head is connected to the Atlas-Axis block through a bolt and nut pivot (Part 4 in Figure 6). This construction allows the head to rotate around a vertical axis as well as around a horizontal lateral axis. The dummy is predominantly made of polyurethane rubber, reinforced with a metal framework. The head and chest of the dummy are specially prepared for Figure 6. Exploded view of TNO-P3/4 dummy.

Abdominal penetration is indicated by im- pressions on a piece of plasticine located between the soft abdominal insert and the lumbar vertebrae (not evaluated in this programme). NECK LOADS- It should be noted that none of the current standards, including ECE-R44, specify pre- scribed measurements and criteria for dummy neck loads. Although Turbeil [23], in his paper on Swedish 2097</page><page sequence="6">programmes, suggests that vertical head accelera- tions can be used to estimate the magnitude of the axial load on the dummy's neck, it is important to realize that this is not valid if the dummy's head comes into contact with other objects. Since the P3/4 child dummy is not normally equip- ped to measure neck loads, TNO commissioned Denton Inc. to develop a special transducer for this purpose. The transducer unit was designed to have virtually the same dimensions and weight as the standard Atlas-Axis block (Part 2 in Figure 6). It was fitted to the dummy after removing the standard Atlas- Axis block. The transducer (Figure 7) is equipped with strain gauged beams and is capable of measuring a shear force (Fx), a tensile/compressive force (Fz) and a moment (My). This means that only loads in the midsagittal plane of the dummy can be measured. Figure 7. Denton neck load transducer re- placing the Atlas-Axis block of the TNO-P3/4 dummy. The neutral axes of the transducer are shown in Figure 8. Since the forces in the x and z directions introduce a moment about the y-axis, it is necessary to correct for this when calculating the bending moment: Mb = My + 0.008 Fx + 0.010 Fz (Nm) It should be noted that as the flexural/extensional motion of the head around the Atlas-Axis joint is normally limited to 1 G (in accordance with ECE-R44), only small bending moments are likely to occur. The location of the transducer was chosen to coincide with the C1/C2 level, which can be considered to be the most vulnerable area of the spine. TEST PROGRAMME-Three series of tests were performed, each with a different aim. In the first series y I T8mm _ ^^iomrn ! x I Figure 8. Design principle of neck load trans- ducer. of tests, the three restraint systems were compared on the basis of measured neck loads. Each of the child restraint systems was tested in its prescribed standard position. This involved using the rear facing system in an inclined (i.e sleeping) position. The arrangement of the test equipment was in accordance with the requirements of ECE-R44. In particular, provision was made for introducing the standard amount of slack into the child restraint belts. In compliance with ECE-R44 [22], the rear facing system was also subjected to a rearward impact. In the second series of tests, only the forward facing seat with 4-point harness belt was used. The test conditions were varied in order to assess their effect on the neck loads induced in the dummy. The following variations were included; - sleeping position seat (versus seating position in first series); - 2 cm extra slack in each of the shoulder belts of the 4-point harness system; - 4 cm extra slack in the 2-point car belt; - increased contact area between the bottom of the child's seat and the car bench (i.e. increased stiffness of the car bench); - increased contact area between the back of the child's seat and the back of the car bench (i.e. increased stiffness of the back of the car bench). The first variation listed above represents a modi- fication of the way the restraint system is configured. 2098</page><page sequence="7">The second and third variations were included to assess the effect of a restraint system being used in- correctly, while variations four and five were intended to evaluate the impact of modifying the relatively soft ECE-R44 type bench cushion. Although, many of the dummies currently used in crash testing have heads which are rigidly connected to the dummy's upper neck surface, TNO child dum- mies have been specifically designed to allow free rotation about the Atlas-Axis joint. In order to assess the significance of this difference, in the third series of tests, it was decided to obstruct the flexural/exten- sional motion of the TNO dummy's head relative to the Atlas-Axis block, i.e. relative to the neck load trans- ducer. This was achieved by rigidly connecting the dummy's head to the transducer. Table A1 in the Appendix summarizes the sequen- ce of tests performed in the present research pro- gramme. COMPUTER MODEL GENERAL-To obtain a better understanding of the response of the TNO child dummy during sled tests and to aid the analysis of the loads induced in the dummy's neck, it was decided to model the complete test set-up using the MADYMO Crash Victim Simula- tion programme [24]. In this phase of the research programme, only the forward facing 4-point harness system was considered. Particular emphasis was placed on analysing the effect of chin-to-chest con- tacts and assessing the importance of the head-to- neck connection in relation to the loads induced in the dummy's neck. Since the motion of the dummy and restraint system in the actual sled tests was judged to be practically two dimensional (i.e. in the sagittal plane), the 2D option of MADYMO (version 4.3) was selected for modelling purposes [25]. Details of the dummy database, the characteristics of the simulation model and the Design of Experiments programme used to analyse test parameter interactions are given below. DUMMY DATABASE-To ensure meaningful com- parisons, use was made of an existing database to characterize the 9-month old TNO-P3/4 child dummy. This database comprised mass and inertia data supplied by the Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and information about the dummy's static joint characteristics derived from TNO tests. The geome- trical data were taken directly from the original design drawings. The form of the 9-element 2D dummy model is shown in Figure 9. Further details are contained in the MADYMO databases manual [26]. Two modifications were made to the standard database in order to simulate the kinematics of the dummy used in the actual sled tests more closely. The stops in the joint characteristics of the (lower) neck and spine were made less stiff and the stop in the upper neck joint (i.e. head/neck joint) was omitted. The latter change resulted in a joint with a free range of motion, which is a fairly accurate representation of the actual dummy head/neck joint. As a result of this modification, the force/deflection characteristic of the chin-to-chest contact had to be adjusted (i.e. a stiffer contact). Modifying the standard dummy database y=&gt; Figure 9. Geometry and tocation of the local coordinate systems in the TNO-P3/4 dummy model. in this way enabled the kinematics of the model dummy to be harmonized with the actual dummy used in thp qIpH tpçtç MODEL OF THE CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM AND SLED-ln order to analyse the sled test in some detail, it was not only necessary to model the dummy that was used, but the child restraint system and the ECE-R44 sled also had to be included. Figure 10 shows a schematic representation of the complete model. The MADYMO 2D programme was used to model the forward facing 4-point harness system used in the sled tests described above. The restraint 2099</page><page sequence="8">system was divided into two separate systems for inclusion in the simulation model. This allowed a clear distinction to be made between the child seat and the harness belt buckle. The inertial properties of these two systems were measured at TNO. The required geometrical data were taken from technical drawings of the restraint system. The child seat was simulated using three discrete planes to describe the contact interactions with the dummy and three hyperellipses to describe the con- tact with the ECE-R44 sled bench (see Figure 10). The bottom of the child seat was divided into two Figure 10. Model showing the TNO-P3/4 dummy, the child seat with 4-point harness system, the 2-point car belt and the sled bench cushion. separate ellipses to allow a more realistic spread of the contact forces with the sled bench and to simulate the bottoming effect of the bench at the rear end of the sled. The force/deflection characteristics for these contact interactions were derived from static tests conducted at TNO. The belt buckle was simulated using a single small contact ellipse, which was positioned on the abdomen of the dummy. The buckle was allowed to slide up or down over the contact ellipses on the dummy. In the actual restraint system, the buckle was connected to a 4-point harness belt system (i.e. two shoulder and two lap belt connections). Since the shoulder belts in this design of restraint system cannot slip relative to each other, these belts were represented by separate MADYMO belt systems. As both lap belt connections on the buckle were linked to the same belt passing underneath the child seat, it was decided to model the lap belt as a single belt system. Finally, the sled bench was simulated by 4 contact planes and the child seat restrained to the ECE-R44 bench by a standard 2- point car belt. SYSTEMATIC DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS-To obtain a better understanding of the underlying pheno- mena, it was decided to introduce multi-parameter variations in the simulation studies, rather than changing one parameter at a time, as was done in the experimental sled tests. However, in order to take full account of possible interactions between the para- meters, it was necessary to adopt a systematic Design of Experiments approach [27]. A programme with a special minimization algorithm was used to analyse the effect of parameter interactions. This programme, which is known as CADE (Computer Aided Design of Experiments), has been developed at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands [28, 29]. CADE is capable of computing an optimal solution for a design problem by minimizing mathematical target functions. The target functions selected for this study were the first and second order regression functions of the shear force, the tensile force and the bending moment in the upper neck joint of the MADYMO model. Use of the CADE programme allowed the three neck loads to be minimized separately. However, it was not the intention to use the CADE programme to optimize the child seat design, but to gain a better understanding of the significance of specific parametric changes. The parameters varied in the MADYMO simulations were identical to the 6 parameters studied in the three experimental series with the forward facing 4-point harness system described above. RESULTS OF SLED TESTS GENERAL-A summary of the results of the 24 sled tests is given in Table A2 of the Appendix. In the following sections, the neck loads obtained from the three test series are discussed in detail. COMPARISON OF CHILD RESTRAINT SYS- TEMS-Table 1 summarizes the mean maximum neck loads obtained in the first test series. It can be seen that the forces generated with the shield system are slightly higher than those obtained with the 4-point harness system, while the forces generated with the rear facing system (in a frontal crash) were consider- ably lower. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that the maximum axial tensile forces are some 2-3 times higher than the shear forces. In addition, the mea- sured bending moments can be seen to be extremely low. This is not surprising in view of the design of the head and neck of the P3/4 dummy (see also the results of the third series of tests). 2100</page><page sequence="9">Table 1 Mean maximum neck loads (first test series) Restraint Fx Fz Mb system flex ext (kN) (kN) (Nm) (Nm) 4-point harness 0.83 1.55 2.5 3.4 impact shield 0.92 1.71 2.0 4.1 rearward facing 0.25 0.73 4.0 1.4 High speed film analyses have shown that during the tests with the 4-point harness system, the dummy's chin impacted the upper torso. In the tests with the shield system, the dummy's face could clearly be seen to impact the shield. These impacts not only affected the accelerations of the dummy's head, but also influenced the induced neck forces. A more detailed study of these aspects was made in subsequent com- puter simulations (see 'Computer simulation results'). Figure 1 1 shows the mean maximum neck loads presented in Table 1 as a percentage of the proposed adult tolerance limits for neck injuries [18], namely: - Bending moment 190 Nm (flexure); - Bending moment 57 Nm (extension); - Maximum shear force 31 00 N; - Maximum tensile force 3300 N. The maximum shear force measured with the TNO- P3/4 child dummy in both forward facing systems was approximately 30% of the proposed adult limit. In addi- tion, the maximum tensile force in both systems was about 50% of the proposed limit. Considerably lower percentages were, however, found with the rear facing system, in all cases, the measured bending moment was substantially below the proposed adult limit. The shear and tensile force limits for adults, pro- posed in ref. [18], have a time dependent character (see also Figure 2). To investigate the significance of this, it was decided to calculate the force level corres- ponding to a 30 ms time duration (i.e. a similar calcu- lation as for a standard 3 ms maximum). The adult tolerance limits for a 30 ms time duration are: - Maximum shear force 1500 N; - Maximum tensile force 2936 N. It can be seen that adopting this approach significantly reduces the shear force tolerance limit. Table 2 sum- marizes the mean maximum shear and tensile forces (30 ms duration) obtained from the tests with the TNO child dummy. It can be seen that these values are lower than those presented in Table 1, especially in the case of the shield system. For comparison pur- poses, these results are given as a percentage of the 30 ms adult tolerance limit in Figure 12. 50 • % 0 4-point harness 40 " S shield "¡n !■ yyy. '''''- ^ □ rearward facing yyy.

In the case of the tensile force, there is almost a factor of 2 difference. By com- parison, the forces associated with the rear facing system can be seen to be extremely low. The rear facing system was also tested in a 30 km/h rearward impact according to ECE-R44 [22], Table 3 shows that the measured neck loads were higher than those obtained during the 50 km/h forward impact with this restraint system. Moreover, it can be seen that the maximum neck forces obtained with the rear facing system in a 30 km/h rearward impact were approximately 30% lower than those obtained with the forward facing harness system tested in a 50 km/h frontal impact. TEST CONDITIONS-Table 4 summarizes the mean maximum neck loads obtained during the second test series carried out with the forward facing 4-point harness system. It can be seen that varying the test conditions did not have a dramatic effect on the results obtained. The measured bending moments were very low in all tests. Compared with the reference tests, the largest reduction in shear force was about 5%. The lowest shear force was obtained in the test in which extra slack was introduced into the harness belt. The largest reduction in the measured tensile force was of the order of 10%. This was obtained by increasing the stiffness of the back of the bench. The largest increases observed in the shear and tensile forces were 17% and 10% respectively. Both increases resulted from extra slack being introduced in the car belt. Locating the child seat in the sleeping position as opposed to the standard seating position resulted in a 16% increase in the maximum shear force and a 8% rise in the maximum tensile force. The 30 ms maximum forces in the sleeping position were only 4% and &lt;1% higher, respectively. It was readily apparent that the ECE-R44 criteria on 'head excursions' and 'chest accelerations' were complied with in all of the tests in this series.

Although the rotational speed of the dummy's head was reduced in the fixed' head tests, this did not prevent the head from impacting the upper torso (in the case of the 4-point harness system) or the shield (in the case of the shield system). More specifically, it can be seen that fixing the dummy's head resulted in the flexural bending moment being increased from 2 Nm to approximately 1 6 Nm in the case of the 4-point harness system and to 1 1 Nm in the case of the shield system. This clearly demonstrates that fixing the dummy's head can have a significant effect on the magnitude of the induced neck loads. The forces measured in the tests with the rear facing system were found to be comparable with those of the 'free' head tests. In the case of the rear facing system, the extensional bending moment increased from 1 Nm to 6 Nm. In Figure 13, the maximum child dummy neck loads are presented as a percentage of the proposed adult neck load limits. The ratios for the forward facing systems can be seen to be much lower than in the free' head tests presented in Figure 1 1 . Here again, the highest forces are seen to be associated with the shield system. The rear facing system produced a lower shear force than the forward facing systems, while the tensile forces were of equal magnitude. The fact that such a relatively high tensile force was induced in the test with the rear facing system was thought to be due to the orientation of the restraint system in this test (i.e. sleeping position) and the additional rearward rotation during impact resulting from deformation of the bench cushion. The flexural and extensional bending moments in the fixed' head tests were again found to be rather low compared with the adult limits. The highest ratio (i.e. 11% in the extension mode) was observed in the case of the rear facing system. In Figure 14, the 30 ms maximum neck loads obtained from the 'fixed' head tests are presented as a percentage of the proposed adult limits.

The highest ratio was obtained for the 30 ms shear force in the forward facing 4-point harness test. This amoun- ted to 25% of the proposed adult limit of 1500 N. The influence of the head-to-neck connection is discussed in more detail in the section entitled 'Computer simulation results'. 2103</page><page sequence="12">COMPUTER SIMULATION RESULTS GENERAL-After validating the computer simula- tion runs with the results obtained during the sled test with the forward facing 4-point harness system, the simulation model was used to analyse the effect of chin-to-chest contacts and to assess the significance of the head-to-neck connection on the neck loads. Finally, the CADE optimization programme was employed to analyse the effect of combinations of test parameters. VALIDATION EXERCISE-For the validation of the MADYMO model, reference was made to the results obtained during the standard sled test with the forward facing 4-point harness system (test no. E5723 in Table A1 and A2 of the Appendix). The validation procedure not only involved comparing the kinematics of the dummy and the child seat, but also involved comparing the acceleration versus time responses of the dummy's head and chest. Figure 15 shows the kinematics derived from the MADYMO simulation. Detailed comparison of these plots with the measured responses showed that as a result of the modifications made to the 'dummy database', the kinematic response of the model was very close to that of the actual dummy and child seat. Figure 16 shows the linear accelerations of the dummy's head and chest derived from the model simulation runs, as well as the results of the actual sled test. It can be seen that the calculated acceleration traces are in good agreement with the experimental results. Following this, detailed comparisons were made between the neck loads calculated in the model and those measured in the sled test. The forces in the model were calculated with respect to the local coordinate system of the neck (Y4, Z4 in Figure 9). Figure 17 shows that the maximum shear force calculated using the model seems to be somewhat higher than the shear force measured during the sled . • • Time 0 30 60 (ms) • • 90 120 Figure 15.

This difference can partly be ex- plained by the fact that the model has a rigid neck element, while in reality the dummy's neck bends forward. As a consequence, discrepancies between the transducer position and the orientation of the local coordinate system of the neck will tend to increase as the simulation progresses. Since the head/neck joint in the model was assumed to have a free range of motion, with no damping or frictional torques, the bending moments calculated in the simulation runs were zero. In comparison, only a small insignificant torque was measured in the sled test. This was primarily due to the 1 G setting of the head/neck joint (see Figure 17). CHIN-TO-CHEST CONTACTS-To analyse the significance of chin-to-chest contacts in both the experimental sled tests and in the computer simula- tions, additional computer runs were made in which the stiffness of this contact was changed.

E5723. the shear and tensile forces calculated in the standard simulation are compared with the corresponding data obtained from simulations in which the stiffness of the chin-to-chest contact has been reduced by a factor 2. It can be seen that the maximum tensile force declines if the contact stiffness is reduced, whereas the shear force increases slightly. Although these simulations showed that the stiffness of chin-to-chest contacts can have a significant effect on neck forces, and especially on the magnitude of the tensile force, it was not possible to assess differences in bending moment levels as the head/neck joint allowed free motions. HEAD-TO-NECK CONNECTION-ln order to fix the head of the dummy rigidly to the neck element in the MADYMO model a frictional torque was introduced at the head/neck joint of approximately 18 Nm. This resulted in considerably lower shear and tensile forces (see Figure 19). The lower force levels were caused by the lower rotational velocity of the head, which in turn resulted in a lower speed of impact at the chest (a speed reduction of about 55%). An intermediate frictional force was also simulated in the model (see the data for the 'half fastened' case in Figure 19). Reference to the figure shows that reducing this frictional force had a more pronounced effect on the tensile force trace than on the shear force trace. It is readily apparent from these simulations that the torque characteristics of the head/neck joint can have a major impact on the magnitude of the induced neck loads. TEST PARAMETER INTER ACTIONS-As attempts to analyse the interactions between the six test para- meters using a linear model within the CADE pro- gramme, gave unsatisfactory results, subsequent opti- mizations were performed to assess both first and second order interactions. It was shown that the shear force could be reduced by about 23% compared with the standard simulation case. The most significant reductions were achieved by increasing the stiffness of the back of the sled bench and by rigidly fixing the head to the neck. The combination of head fixation and increased slack in the harness belt system also gave a large reduction in shear force. Further analyses performed to optimize the tensile force level showed that it was possible to reduce the magnitude of this force by 21%, compared with the base case, by selecting a judicious combination of the 6 test parameters. Increasing the stiffness of the back of the sled bench can be considered to be a particularly important parameter in this context. Rigidly fixing the head, whilst at the same time locating the seat in the prescribed sleeping position will also significantly reduce the level of the induced tensile forces. Moreover, combining these three parameters with an increased stiffness of the sled bench cushion will serve to reduce the magnitude of the tensile forces even more. Optimizing the bending moment does not appear to be feasible, since the 'head-fixation' parameter has too great an effect on the results. If the 'head free* variant is used zero bending moments are obtained. 2106</page><page sequence="15">= Basic Simulation = Basic Simulation = Chest stiffness * 05 = Chest stiffness * 05 1600 - ļ 1600 - ļ 1400 - 1400 - /' 1200 - 1200 - /VA 1000 - ' 'N 1000 - |ļ 800 - J V 800 - / Ž 600 - / V ^ 600 - / ļ I - / V ' ^ 400 / ^ 400 - / ' § 400 / I.

In spite of this, serious cervical spine injuries in children seem to be rare. In general, the occurrence of severe cervical spine injuries is associated with head impacts caused by automotive or non-automotive accidents. After questions were raised about the safety of re- straint systems for young children in Europe, an inter- national working party was established to collect data on automotive accidents involving young children. Special attention was focused on accidents in which young children restrained in forward facing restraint systems with either a 4 or 5-point harness belt re- ceived severe cervical spine injuries. It was found that these injuries were frequently associated with the C1/C2 level. In order to assess the significance of these findings, several research groups have instiga- ted research programmes to investigate the neck loads induced in forward facing and rear facing systems. Recently, Langwieder et al. [30] have compared the performance of various forward facing systems with 4-point harness belts or impact shields. For the purpose of this study, Langwieder and his co-workers developed a special transducer for the TNO-P3/4 and P3 child dummies, which can measure neck forces in three directions. However, no bending moments were recorded as part of their investigations. After com- paring the performance of both types of restraint sys- tems in the normal seating position, it was concluded that they gave rise to peak resultant forces of com- parable magnitudes (i.e. 2.7 kN). Tests carried out with a 4-point harness system in the sleeping position showed a 19% increase in the neck load. The authors also compared the performance of rear facing sys- tems during forward and rearward impacts. It was shown that rearward impacts induced neck loads which were twice as high as those induced in forward impacts. These results are supported by the findings of the current TNO study, in which a different neck load transducer has been used. The performance of the Denton transducer used in the TNO tests has proved to be extremely satisfactory and consideration is now being given to modifying the basic design to allow measurements to be made about three axes. The results obtained in the present research programme, indicate that the high neck forces induced with the shield system are primarily due to head impacts with the shield. These findings are in agreement with the observations of Langwieder et al. [30]. Reference to the work Dejeammes [15] shows that she only observed muscular haemorrhages with substantial head flexions in child cadaver tests, while a fracture-dislocation of the atlanto-occipital joint was found in a child cadaver caused by a violent head-to- shield impact. If the longer duration loadings of child dummy necks are analysed, it is apparent that the forces obtained with the shield system drop considerably. For instance, the shear and tensile forces obtained with the 4-point harness system were 50% to 80% higher than the forces induced with the shield system under such circumstances. Notwithstanding this, the tensile force induced in all systems appears to be higher than the shear force. Nevertheless, the tolerance limit in respect of tensile forces is somewhat higher, at least in the case of adults. As the long duration forces induced with the forward facing 4-point harness system reached a level of approximately 40% of the proposed adult limit (ref. [18]), this could help to explain the accident data collected for children using these systems. However, these results should be interpreted with care since there is a paucity of tolerance data for neck injuries in children. In addition, it should be noted that the results generated in the present programme have been obtained using a dummy that has not been specifically designed to measure such loads. To a certain extent, the measured forces could have been influenced by the chin-to-chest contact of the dummy. The stiffness of this contact has not been compared with that of young children. However, computer simulations based on the MADYMO CVS programme have shown that this stiffness should be taken into account in future studies. It is interesting to note in this context that Kramer [31] has recently presented a mathematical model in which chin-to-chest contacts can be seen to affect the calculated neck loads in adults. The results obtained in the present programme also illustrate that the bending moment in the neck of the TNO P3/4 dummy appears to be relatively low as a result of the design of the head-neck system (i.e. a hinge joint with a normal torque setting of 1 G). This feature together with the (adjustable) stiffness of the neck gives a spine flexibility which is similar to that of child cadavers [21, 21], To analyse the influence of head-neck motions on neck loads, tests were carried out with the head rigidly fixed to the top of the neck (i.e. to the Atlas-Axix block). It was found that this design modification significantly reduced the rotational velocity of the head, which resulted in less severe chin-to-chest and head-to-shield impacts. As a consequence, the shear and tensile forces induced with the forward facing systems were considerably reduced, while the forces induced with the rear facing system were not significantly affected. The latter observation can probably be explained by the limited degree of head rotation which occurred in these tests (i.e. the back of the head contacted the seat back almost immediately in such cases). 2108</page><page sequence="17">The tensile forces induced with the rear facing system in forward impacts were found to be as high as those induced with forward facing systems when the dummy's head was fixed to the neck. Due to this modification, the bending moments in the dummy's neck were increased by a factor of 5, regardless of the system tested. Since the tolerance limit for extension appears to be lower than that for flexure, at least for adults, this increase is of greater significance for rear facing systems. The tests performed with the dummy's head rigidly connected to its neck also showed that the forward facing 4-point harness system only gave the highest neck forces in terms of long duration loading. Computer simulations have shown that dummy features, such as the free flexural and extensional motions of the head, can have a significant effect on the magnitude of the resulting neck forces and bending moments. In order to optimize child restraint systems with respect to neck loads, it is essential to have access to realistic dummies. In the previous paragraphs, reference was made to the fact that the tensile forces and extensional bending moments induced with rear facing systems in frontal impacts can be as high as those induced with forward facing systems, especially when the head of the dummy is rigidly connected to the neck. Since severe neck injuries are rare in rear facing systems involved in frontal impacts [23], this could suggest that the shear forces and flexural bending moments are indicative of the injuries caused and/or that a dummy with a free' head is more realistic. A direct comparison between the performance of a forward facing system in a 50 km/h forward impact and that of a rear facing system in a 30 km/h rearward impact showed a neck load ratio of approximately 5:3. This would seem to indicate that rear facing systems are not inherently safer than forward facing systems. On the contrary, it is the combination of the impact direction and the type of restraint system that makes this system appear safer. Rearward impacts occur less frequently and are mostly less severe than frontal impacts. Nowadays, misuse of child restraint systems is a well-recognized problem. When data about children with tetraplegia were presented in Germany and particularly when attention was focused on the low severity of the car crashes in which the injuries were sustained (i.e. less than the ECE-R44 velocity change), it was thought that incorrect use of the child restraint systems (4-point harness system) could have been a major contributory factor. Another possible reason cited for these injuries concerned differences in performance of restraints systems in passenger cars, particularly in respect of the fact that the ECE- R44 bench is less stiff than those found in certain cars. In the current research programme, it was shown that changes in harness belt slack, car belt slack, sitting position and bench stiffness can have a certain effect on neck loads. However, the impact of changing such parameters was much less than had originally been anticipated. This is particularly true in the light of the substantial variations introduced. For instance the 2 cm extra slack introduced at both shoulder belts of the 4-point harness system was sufficient for the dummy to be removed without opening the buckle. On balance, it was felt that the chin-to-chest contact pro- bably had a disproportionate effect on neck loadings. The Computer Aided Design of Experiments simulations showed that the 'fixed head' option had an extremely large effect on the resultant neck loads, especially in combination with other variations in test conditions. It is postulated that on the basis of the current parameter mix, it should be possible to reduce the neck forces induced in the forward facing system used in this programme by 20-25%. The forward facing concept could also be improved by making better use of the space available. Fortunately, such design solutions can be assessed relatively easily with computer simulation techniques. TNO plans to perform further CADE simulations, which will involve extending the range of parametric variations and introducing risk functions [31 , 32] for the optimization of neck loads. To support this work, in-depth analysis studies will be conducted and simulations carried out of accidents which have resulted in severe neck injuries. Although it was recognized that the TNO child dummies were developed more than a decade ago and do not incorporate the most recent biomechanical information, this was not seen as a serious drawback for the present programme, as there is still a general paucity of data relating to child cervical spine injury mechanisms and tolerances. In spite of the fact that a well-defined dummy was not available to represent a child of approximately 1 year old, it is felt that use of the TNO P3/4 dummy in the current research programme can be justified in view of the proximity of the ages and the fact that a comprehensive database has been developed for this dummy. Use of the database allowed an integrated research programme to be designed involving both experimental tests and simulation exercises. It has been shown that the free range of motion of the head around the occipital condyles is an important dummy design parameter with respect to neck load evaluation. In the case of children, it is likely that the permitted range is probably between the extreme values (i.e. free or omitted) evaluated in the present programme. In this context, it is important to note that TNO has recently initiated a programme to re-design its child dummy family. Biofidelity and instrumentation 2109</page><page sequence="18">requirements that were highlighted in the present programme will be taken into account in this work. Notwithstanding this, the present research programme has demonstrated that international co-operation in the field of accident analysis, biomechanical research and dummy development is essential if the complex problems associated with severe cervical spine injuries in children are to be solved.
