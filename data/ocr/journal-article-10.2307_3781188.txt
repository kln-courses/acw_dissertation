PAYNE, College of Natural Resources, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Stevens Point, WI 54481 Society has the responsibility to maintain wildlife as part of the natural heritage for fu- ture generations to enjoy. Management of wild animals is necessary in most areas of the world due to the increasing human population and its heavy demands on the land. Hunting is a valuable tool in managing big game, res- ident small game, and waterfowl, but it is rel- atively ineffective in managing aquatic and many terrestrial furbearers because of their secretive behavior. In the management of fur- bearers, trapping is the best alternative for harvest where necessary or desirable. But there are 2 issues here-the necessity or de- sirability of harvest, and the means by which it is accomplished. There are 6 major incentives for harvesting furbearers: (1) food, (2) recreation, (3) profit, (4) population control, (5) nuisance control, and (6) research. Currently, there is little har- vest of furbearers primarily for food in most of North America. Although trapping and han- dling animals are forms of outdoor recreation for many people, most trapping of furbearers is for profit (Reiger 1978); forbearer harvests quickly decline when pelt prices drop (Keith 1963). Furbearers provide considerable in- come to people engaged in harvesting and handling animals and manufacturing fur prod- ucts (U.S. Department of Commerce 1966). Furthermore, many trappers are on the lower economic level of society (Reiger 1978) and rely on trapping as a supplemental source of income (Payne 1980). Trapping for profit is part of the North American heritage (Committee on Agricultur- al Land Use and Wildlife Resources 1970, In- nis 1956, Phillips 1961), although its role in modern society is vastly reduced. Currently, many of the furs used by the fur industry come from ranch animals raised in captivity (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1978). The use of natural furs-a renewable resource-may re- duce demands for synthetic fur, which is made from petroleum-an increasingly scarce and costly nonrenewable resource. Suitable substitutes for both natural and synthetic fur presently are available for warmth, if not fash- ion. In fact, the management and harvest of furbearers specifically, and wildlife in gen- eral, for recreation or profit is similar to the management and harvest of livestock because in today's society neither livestock nor wild- life is essential for either food or clothing. Both are becoming a luxury; compare the costs and availability of clothing and protein from domestic or wild animals to those of plants. Thus, harvesting furbearers for profit is as justifiable as killing livestock for profit, or any commercial exploitation of wild ani- mals, unless that harvesting results in elimi- nation of forbearer populations. In the past, uncontrolled harvest was re- sponsible for declines in furbearer popula- tions (Trefethen 1975). Now regulations are designed to prevent trapping from threaten- ing the survival of furbearer populations. However, these regulations have no control over habitat loss. Today habitat loss is the sin- gle most important threat to furbearer popu- lations and wildlife in general (Allen 1954, Committee on Agricultural Land Use and Wildlife Resources 1970). For example, Wis- consin alone has lost over half of its original 3,000,000 ha of wetlands, which are essential habitat for aquatic furbearers and are also im- portant to terrestrial furbearers (DeWitt 1980). There are over 24,000 ha of private land in Wisconsin licensed as fur farms (not including mink (Mustela vison) ranches), and many of these are wetlands for aquatic furbearers (Wisconsin DNR, unpubl. data). Also attrac- tive to waterfowl, shorebirds, songbirds, rep- tiles, amphibians, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other wildlife, these lands probably would not be maintained if it were not for the profit in trapping. Because most furbearers are not readily seen by the general public, trap- pers have been influential in drawing atten- tion to the presence of furbearers. To be suc-</page><page sequence="2">346 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 8(4) 1980 cessful, trappers must be alert ecologically (Reiger 1978). Nevertheless, most are not es- pecially environmentally concerned or active (Kellert 1977). MANAGEMENT Holt and Talbot (1978) mentioned that when a resource is used, there is the obliga- tion to adhere to 4 general principles involv- ing maintaining the ecosystem properly, in- cluding a safety factor in management decisions, avoiding wasteful use of other re- sources, and assessing the use of the resource. Management measures and regulations gov- erning the use of furbearers must be designed to ensure existence of forbearer populations and optimize public benefits, and that in- cludes both consumptive (trapping) and non- consumptive uses. If the management objective is to maintain maximum sustained yield, it is desirable and biologically sound to harvest a population sys- tematically at regular intervals. Furbearers, like most other wildlife, produce an annual surplus (Allen 1954, Errington 1945), some of which may be harvested on a sustained an- nual basis to maintain a relatively stationary population. Controlled harvest of certain her- bivorous species of furbearers (beaver (Cas- tor canadensis) and muskrats (Ondatra zi- bethicus)) can prevent or reduce damage to the animal's habitat, although that habitat change is desirable for some species of wild- life while undesirable for others. Dynamic fluctuations occur particularly in muskrat and small rodent populations when, in certain years, animals are produced far in excess of the carrying capacity of the habitat (Allen 1954). Many carnivorous species of furbearers fluctuate with the rodent populations on which they feed (Dasmann 1964, Keith 1963). Harvesting muskrat and other furbearers re- duces these oscillations of furbearer popula- tions and increases the harvest while main- taining breeding stock. Both muskrat and beaver should be trapped heavily during se- vere winters when ice is thick to reduce the widespread starvation that otherwise might occur in these species. Harvesting the annual surplus reduces competition among furbear- ers for food and cover, increases the chances of survival for the remaining population, and improves health and fecundity of individuals within the population. Because no species of furbearer exists in isolation, exploitation of 1 species has some impact on other components of the ecosystem (Holt and Talbot 1978). If the management objective is to reduce wide-scale nuisance problems that would re- sult in expensive control measures for beaver and muskrat particularly, the harvest should exceed the annual increment enough to offset compensatory reproduction, or breeders should be harvested to reduce population size. If the management objective is to protect livestock and crops from individual furbear- ers, harvest of the individual perpetrator, when feasible, may be a more appropriate al- ternative than to declare war on all members of the species. If the management objective is to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and parasites (e.g., mange, rabies, tularemia) that might af- fect public health, pets, or pelt quality and quantity, it may be desirable to reduce pop- ulations of any species of furbearer. Such nat- ural phenomena usually act as population control measures, and disease transmission is reduced when the forbearer population is re- duced through natural mortality. If the management objective is to establish and maintain populations of selected wildlife species (e.g., waterfowl, pheasants (Pha- sianus coichicus)) on certain management areas or in marginal habitat, controlled har- vest of certain predatory furbearers may be necessary (Duebbert and Kantrud 1974). If the management objective is to maintain furbearers for nonconsumptive use or to per- mit alterations in population densities and habitat (by beaver and muskrat) that affect other species of wildlife naturally, then no harvest of furbearers may be necessary. If the management objective is to reintro- duce furbearers, no harvest must occur until the population has increased and dispersed. Harvest may begin when the population is still below the carrying capacity of the habitat</page><page sequence="3">BRIEFER ARTICLES 347 Table 1.

Usually they render the animal unconscious, and then suffocate it. Of 233 trap designs tested by federal and provincial wildlife biologists in Canada, ...... not one prototype has produced the impact required to cause humane death to the range of animals likely to be taken in the field" (Reilly 1978:5). e Strangulation may be relatively rapid if proper locking devices are used. Spring-powered snares for rapid dispatch and Aldrich foot snares are increasing in use. dMany aquatic furbearers do not drown as they should when caught because many trappers do not make proper drowning sets; nor is drowning an instant death. eStandard live (cage) traps are not painless as is commonly thought by many people. Cage-trapped animals often injure themselves in escape attempts. Cage traps also cause considerable stress to captured animals, as evidenced by the incidence of shock disease (stress mortality) in various live-trapped species (Guthrie et al. 1967). if less than the annual increment is taken. This will permit the population to increase to the carrying capacity while being harvested, although the rate of increase may be reduced. Usually management objectives for both consumptive and nonconsumptive uses can be accomplished within the same general lo- cation. If harvest is carefully regulated so that the annual increment is not exceeded, the breeding stock remains for nonconsumptive users to observe the animals and/or their sign. TRAPPING The principal devices used to capture most furbearers are snares, live (cage) traps, quick- kill traps, and steel leghold traps. Poisons are generally illegal. Deadfalls and shooting are illegal for many furbearers in North America, although shooting is widely used for some species. All methods of capture have advan- tages and disadvantages (Table 1). The com- parison suggests the steel leghold trap is still the most versatile trap available. Opposition to trapping often is rooted in anthropomorphic attitudes, although the pub- lic's opinion of the type of trap used may not be as important as its opinion of the trapper (Reiger 1978). The development of more hu- mane methods of capturing and killing fur- bearers (or other wildlife) will never satisfy all the opposition. Indeed, the definition of the very word humane is controversial and moot. Lower forms of life tend to have less- developed nervous systems and presumably a higher threshold of pain relative to human standards. Yet, in many ways the environmen- tal conditions for survival of wildlife require a more sensitive nervous system than that for survival of humans. Efforts should be encouraged to develop new or modified traps or techniques that min- imize trauma while maintaining acceptable levels of efficiency. Indeed, such studies are in progress (Reilly 1978). Courses in trapper education should be required of trappers be- fore licenses are issued. These actions require full support from trappers, for unless trappers fulfill their responsibilities, research and de- velopment of humane trapping systems will</page><page sequence="4">348 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 8(4) 1980 not reach fruition and the retention of trap- ping may not be possible. But even more ef- fort should be expended on acquiring, pre- serving, and restoring forbearer habitat so that the trapping issue is not merely hypothetical.
