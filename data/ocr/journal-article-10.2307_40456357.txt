Comparison with Rock Paintings in South Africa, Rhodesia and Eastern Spain Summary and Conclusion Introduction The sandstone hills of the Central Plateau of India abound in rock shel- ters, many of which contain paintings executed in a style that reminds of the neolithic paintings of Eastern Spain, Rhodesia, and South Africa on one hand and of Australia oil the other. The subject matter generally deals with battle scenes, warriors with bows and arrows, clubs, spears and swords, hunting and dancing scenes and different animal figures. Besides these paintings these rock shelters are very rich in geometric microliths made of chalcedony, jasper, and sometimes of bottle glass. The use of bottle glass argues well with the modernity of the culture and at the same time shows that in India the stone age persisted in isolated tribal areas even up to our own times, coexisting with highly ad- vanced urban cultures in the adjoining valleys. No pottery has been found so far to occur in association with the microliths found in these rock shelters x. These rock paintings have in the past attracted but little attention and have been the subject matter of only a few papers which are by no means exhaustive and contain a general account of the art depicted. Among those 1 These rock shelters were to be excavated by the author under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Govt. of India. The project could not materialize because of the non-cooperative attitude of the Archaeological Survey of India.</page><page sequence="2">760 A. P.

The writer spent some time in the Pachmarhi and Mahadeo Hills during the years 1958-61 when he was occupied with the pre historical survey of the upper and middle reaches of the Narmada in order to work out its stone age sequence and the pleistocene chronology, and was able to study and photograph some of the important paintings in the rock shelters in which these hills abound. Even a new group of painted rock shelters situated between Tamia and Pach- marhi was discovered which contained paintings almost similar to those found in other rock shelters of this region. In the following the Adamgarh rock shelters will be discussed. It is suggested that the paintings on the walls and roofs and the microlithic culture on the floor, belong to the ancestors of some of the tribal folk, like Gonds, who inhabited and still inhabit this part of Central India. 1. The Adamgarh Sandstone Hillock Only a mile and a quarter south of Houshangabad, in a fertile plain of the Narmada which is on both sides flanked by the mountains of Vindhachal and Satpura, there is a sandstone outcrop known as Adamgarh. Its importance as a high point in the midst of gently undulating wheat fields must have been immense in war and peace to the tribais of the days bygone. This sandstone hillock is also a quarry centre of great repute and yields sandstone slabs for roofing and flooring. It has roughly north-south strike and dips nearly 40 degrees to the west. The rock shelters occur on the top of this hillock. Though there are many shelters, only 11 of them contain paintings which are still visible though in a bad state of preservation in spite of being controlled by the Central Government Department of Archaeology. In attempting to preserve the paintings, the department's chemist damaged them and marred the beauty and the original charm of the paintings. Moreover, tourists have tried to make their own paintings, commemorating their visit to a prehistoric place. 2. The Paintings - Their Style and Subject Matter The colours of these paintings are mostly dark brown, pale brown, red, and white. The paintings are generally miniature-sized. They are drawn in a simplified style without going into the details of physical proportion and lack any artistic value except for some cases. The figures are drawn only in outlines, the inside space is left vacant. In some cases, the figures are "solid", "half- solid", and half drawn in outlines. In one or two figures the space inside the outlines is filled out with hatched lines. Though the paintings have little artistic value the force and vitality of the artist's brush can be clearly discerned. The movements of animals and human beings have been remarkably caught in the freezes which can be well compared with some of the paintings in Australia, South Africa, Eastern Spain, and South America.</page><page sequence="3">A.

Trees are also painted, but without any detail, so that nothing can be said about the species to which they belong. The place which a painter generally selected for his artistic expression was the vertical smooth face of a big boulder, quite high above the ground, or the walls and the roofs of the rock shelters. But the place they chose must not necessarily have been blank, and the superimposition of the paintings on</page><page sequence="5">762 A. P. KhATRI Anthropos 59. 1964 each other shows that it might have been a taboo to wash away the previous paintings. The new painter, therefore, preferred the same place and painted on the figures and drawings executed earlier. Frederick D. McCarthy of the Sydney Museum, Australia, suggested that probably there was a magical significance or a superstitious belief attached to the paintings that obscuring art might bring calamity or such thing. As to the styles and the superimpositions of the paintings, Gordon (1939) has tried to date and classify them into categories which date from ca. 600 B.C. to 1000 A.D. But in my opinion there is not such a big gap between the earliest and the latest executions. Moreover, the bottle glass microliths were not found at that time, and the association between the culture and the paintings was a doubtful proposition. 3. Description of the Rock Shelters Rock Shelter No. 1 : Smallest one, but with many figures painted in red and dark red ochre. Situated at the southern end of the outcrop, facing east. All paintings have faded except for two: a) A deer with twelve horns, with one of the forelegs raised as if taking a jump. The whole figure is in outline except for neck and head including horns which are in solid. The colour is red ochre. b) Horse in dark grey (steel) colour with forelegs upwards. The mane is depicted clearly. The neck, face and forelegs are in solid, the rest in outline. The drawing is very realistic. Debris present - worth excavating. Rock Shelter No. 2: Situated next to No. 1 along the road going to the other end of the hillock. There are two figures which are still clearly visible among many faded drawings : a) A big spotted deer with two very long horns in the centre of the back wall. Drawn in outline. The colour is red ochre. b) In the left corner there is a curious drawing with an elephant-like body and a scorpion-like trunk which is curved. Debris present, but only along the sides. Rock Shelter No. 3: Only two cows, one behind the other can be seen at the bottom of the whole painted surface. The front cow is in outline while the cow behind is in solid. The profile and perspective are very clear. The wide-horned cows are common in the region. The colour is red ochre. Rock Shelter No. 4: It is the largest and most magnificent rock shelter in the series and contains a large number of paintings. Figures are drawn in red ochre varying in shade from dark to pale. The following figures can be seen : a) Two men fighting with swords and shields; one sword is leaf -like with very clearly depicted ribs. b) A man facing a bull with an arrow on the bow in hunting pose. c) A man on horseback, holding a spear upright. d) Decorated horses. e) A running monkey with its tail erect towards the sky. /) A dancing peacock. g) A bull with two horns, its head lowered towards the ground. h) A tree with branches and leaves. i) At the right end of the rock shelter adjacent to rock shelter No. 5, is a beautiful painting of a lady in upright position (solid), holding a leaf with ribs and veins clearly marked in one hand, a bunch of sticks in the other one. In front of the lady, a running man holding a bar in his upraised hands. The colour is chocolate brown.</page><page sequence="6">Rock Paintings of Adamgarh (Central India) and their Age 763 As a matter of fact, the whole wall is full of paintings without any par- ticular arrangement and composition. The movement of human beings is vivid. This rock shelter is full of debris and worth excavating. It is from this one that the bottle glass microliths were recovered. A fluted core of jasper about three inches long was also found. Rock Shelter No. 5: Only one painting in outline, drawn in red ochre, which could not be distinguished. Plenty of debris. Rock Shelter No. 6: Battle scenes. Men with bows and arrows and shields drawn in red and white. Plenty of debris. Rock Shelter No. 7: Three paintings in red ochre. The space between the outlines is filled with criss-cross lines. The base of the rock shelter is made of the flat surface of a huge boulder. No debris. Rock Shelter No. 8: Three men in action (?) in red ochre. No debris. Rock Shelter No. 9: Another big rock shelter with one or two paintings in white. One is probably of a horse, the other one depicts a twelve-horned stag. Plenty of debris. The back side of this boulder forms the wall of rock shelter No. 10 with a hood on it. Rock Shelter No. 10: The richest in paintings which are well preserved. They are situated quite high above the ground and thus have been saved from the vandalism of the tourists. Battle scenes are drawn in large numbers and the various head gears show that some warriors were foreigners and other tribais. The fight was probably between the local chieftain and the British troops! In the following some of the common drawings are described : a) Four soldiers running with bows and arrows in one hand and clubs in the other, the quiver hanging on the back. Legs and movements are forcefully and nicely expressed. Note the proportions of the different parts of the legs (see plate, c). The scene is drawn in dark red. b) Animal figures like horses. c) A giraffe (plate, d). d) A beautiful bull with wide horns in running posture. The outline is very prom- inent. It is the largest painting in the panel. The drawings are executed differently, in solid as well as in hollow style, and sometimes the empty space between the outlines is filled with criss- cross lines. Underneath the rock forming the platform of this shelter there is black humus which suggests a site of habitation. Rock Shelter No. 11: It is a very big and the most magnificent rock shelter, but has very few paintings. Only one horse-like figure was distinguished. It faces the rock shelter No. 10. No debris. 4. The Pachmarhi Microlithic Culture This culture, as said before, consists of pigmy tools made of a variety of semi-precious stones such as jasper, chalcedony and chert of different colours like red, green or a mixture of the two with yellow added. Sometimes besides bottle glass blood stone is also used. It is found scattered around and inside the rock shelters on the surface. When it was not locally available the raw material was imported. A trial digging in one of the Pachmarhi rock shelters revealed that the microliths do not penetrate beyond a foot and a half. They are prob- ably a single culture site with variance of time.</page><page sequence="7">764 A. P.

KhATRI Anthropos 59. 1964 The microlithic typology consists of blades varying from one centimetre to five centimetres with parallel sharp edges, blades with parallel edges but "backed" on one side, crescents, triangles and trapezes, points with notched necks, scrapers, irregular and fluted cores and other non-descriptive elements. No kind of pottery - hand-made or wheel-made - has been found so far in association with microliths. Thousands of microliths are collected from the different rock shelters in the Pachmarhi Hills and from the Adamgarh. But they are still in the process of analysis. However, a rough analysis given below of the Adamgarh material showed that the geometric elements formed nearly 15% of the material collected.

Early Stone Age Tools from the Adamgarh It was proved by the occurrence of hand axes, cleavers and discoids, particularly in the latérite deposits which were formed on the slopy sides of the hills in pockets, that the hillock of Adamgarh has been inhabited since the lower palaeolithic times. This process of lateritisation was probably an in situ occurrence and took place long after the tools were prepared as happened in Orissa and other coastal regions of Peninsular India. It is evident from the style and the subject matter of the paintings that the lower palaeolithic culture has nothing to do with the paintings. 6. The Age of the Paintings Gordon (1939) placed the Adamgarh rock paintings in the Early Third Series and compared some of the elements like the shield with apparently similar ones at Ajanta and thus dated them from ca. 600 B. C. to 1000 A. D. I completely disagree with this view as well as with the method of comparison. To compare Ajanta paintings executed with such perfection and royal support with the tribal paintings of Adamgarh is fantastic and out of place. Without going into dogmatic discussions and taking what the actual evidence provides, we can simply say that the painters of Adamgarh were tribal people who painted and recorded the vast scenes of the battles which they probably fought, and at the same time they were the authors of the microliths which they used</page><page sequence="10">Rock Paintings of Adamgarh (Central India) and their Age 767 in their composite tools. When the microlithic culture came in vogue cannot yet be said, but it was in use as late as in the 17th-18th century as proved by the bottle glass microliths. Probably the detailed study of the superimposition of the paintings may throw some light on the question which style was practised first and which one afterwards, but to date them exactly will be impossible. It is not beyond reason to suppose that these paintings in different styles were made by the same group of the tribais manufacturing the microlithic culture. 7. Comparison with Rock Paintings in South Africa, Rhodesia and Eastern Spain As commented before there is suprisingly close resemblance between the rock paintings of South Africa, Rhodesia and Eastern Spain on the one hand and those of Australia on the other. Also the bottle glass used by tribais in the stone age in Africa and Rhodesia after the advent of the white man adds another parallel evidence to the interesting study of the primitive rock paintings and their executers. In Eastern Spain some of the paintings at Cogul (Breuil 1909), Alpera (Breuil 1912), Barranco de Valltorta (Obermaier 1919), and Albarracin (Breuil 1911) resemble the Adamgarh and Pachmarhi rock paintings consider- ably. As a matter of fact they already have been compared with the similar paintings of Bushmen of South Africa associated with Wilton and Stillbay culture containing bottle glass microliths. In Southern Rhodesia the Matopo Hills paintings present a very close similarity to the Central Indian paintings. The line of a running man, for instance, in a rock shelter near the "World's View" (Jones 1949) shows re- semblance with the running warriors of the Adamgarh in rock shelters No. 4 and No. 10. Very well illustrated books on the subject by Tongue (1909), Burkitt (1928), Black and Stow (1930), Rosenthal and Goodwin (1953) and Breuil (1955) show that in South Africa many similar paintings can be sorted. Before closing the account I must mention Burkitt' s narration on finding the bottle glass microliths below the junction of Modern and Riet Rivers in South Africa and varied opinions on it: "Much controversy has been raised as to whether certain fragments of European bottle glass which are found on open upper Smithfield sites are artificial to be assigned to the Smith- field culture. We collected not a few such objects of the left bank just below the junction of the Modern and Riet Rivers." Were they chipped by upper Smith- field men ? Dr. Van Hoepen believed them to be the result of herds of animals trampling over them. But Burkitt ascribed them to be actually associated with Smithfield industry and regarded them as man-made (Burkitt 1928). There is another interesting account of Bushmen buying perfume bottles from the European market. It was found that to them it was the bottle and not the perfume which was important, since it proved a good raw material for making microliths (Clark 1959).</page><page sequence="11">768 A. P. KhATRI Anthropos 59. 1964 Summary and Conclusion 1. In this paper Adamgarh rock shelters in Central India are described which contain geometric microliths on the floor and paintings on their walls and roofs. 2. The raw material of the microliths is jasper, chalcedony, and bpttle glass. The typology consists of blades, triangles and trapezes, lunates, etc. No pottery is found along with them. 3. The paintings are executed in red and white and the figures are sim- plified and stylized but show vigour, vitality, and vividness. The common images are battle scenes, huntings and different animals. 4. It is attempted to show that the microlithic culture and the paintings are associated with each other and that the authors of both were ancestors of the present-day tribais. On the basis of the occurrence of bottle glass micro- liths and beads, it has been shown that the late stone age persisted in India in isolated pockets even to our times. 5. The paintings of Central India are compared with similar paintings of Eastern Spain, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. A parallel instance of the occurrence of bottle glass in Stillbay and Wilton cultures of South Africa and Rhodesia is quoted. References India: Brown P. 1932: Indian Painting. London.
