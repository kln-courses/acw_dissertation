<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading the Horned Crown A Review Article* By Julia M. Asher-Greve (Cambridge, Mass.) 1. Review Iris Furlong's study of horns and horned crowns as attributes of deities in the ED-Periods was presented as a doctoral thesis at the University of Birmingham in 1986 and printed offset from a typewritten manuscript. A preliminary remark: Considering the prior studies on this subject one would have welcomed an iconological study including textual evidence that gives more insight into the emergence, development and formulation of the canonic form of the horned crown and its meaning.1 Contents: 1. A short introduction (pp. 1-3) 2. A comparison of two types of ED divine headdresses (pp. 4-52, Part I) 3. Typology of horns of ED divine headdresses (pp. 53- 95, Part II) 4. Bibliography (pp. 96-104) 5. Statistical analysis (pp. 105-160) (comprising tables showing regional and chronological distribution for each chapter treated in Part I (tables 1 - 20) and the types of horns treated in Part II (tables 21- 27) with references to the catalogue). 6. Catalogue (pp. 161-385) (including types of headdresses (drawings). Order of catalogue follows Part I, i.e. grouped according to the division by context). Reviewing this book posed several problems:2 1. Furlong's conclusions are drawn from analysis based partly on wrong or questionable line-drawings of visual material. This exhibits a lack of familiarity especially with the particular properties of cylinder seal design and seal impressions.3 Some of these corrections would reflect changes in the statistical basis. *) Iris Furlong, Divine Headdresses of Mesopotamia in the Early Dynastic Period.

The statistical tables are unreliable.4 3. Frankfort's chronology is used without reference to recent discussions of Early Dynastic periodization (see below). 4. 40 percent of the material (total 118 objects) is un- provenanced (cf. catalogue pp. 161-385). 5. Stylistic analysis consists primarily of comparisons of representation of horns with animal horns in nature (cf. pp. 64-87). 6. The methodology is 'muddled' (see below). horned crown is questionable; the seal impression is damaged and imprinting could have distorted the image; details have to be verified on the originals. As for A 31 (p. 200-201) which does not correspond with the published photograph, cf. A. Moortgat, Rollsiegel'. Fig. 145: two of the drill-holes next to the "passenger in the boat" are interpreted as "royal bun", but I can only distinguish one drill-hole close enough to the head to be consid- ered as part of a coiffure. The crescent- shaped crown of the third figure is drawn too far away from the head, between the head and crown a horizontal line is missing that connects the bun with the head. The interpretation of the second register scene of this seal as "symbolic of military victory ... and a dog of war" versus the usual royal hunting scene is not substantiated (pp. 14-15). D 5a on p. 233, one of the crowns on the 'Stele of Vultures', does not have a "mouth" in the center "face". Furlong's interpre- tation of the deity as Utu (p. 17) is unlikely, considering this monument comes from Girsu (Lagash). A reference to I.J. Win- ter, "After the Battle is Over: The Stele of Vultures and the Beginning of Historical Narrative in the Art of the Ancient Near East", in: Studies in the History of Art 16, 1985, pp. 11-32, is missing. A 18b, p. 187: no horns are visible on photograph or impression, dito on A 19, D 1-8, M 2, etc. 4) For example: on Table 5, the statistical basis for chapter 1.1 (scenes with boatgods) - representing over one third of all objects studied - the total number of objects listed is 41, but the accompanying references list only 38 objects which correspond to the 38 objects listed in the catalogue (A 1-38, pp. 170-207). Comparing catalogue to table, there are 23 of known provenance in the catalogue but 26 in the table, 1 3 of unknown provenance in the catalogue but 15 in the table; one of "known" provenance (A 20) is an attribution and one (A 25) marked as such (both in catalogue) are correctly listed as "unprovenanced" in table. There are many such inconsistencies.</page><page sequence="2">182 Julia M. Asher-Greve 7. More than half the book consists of bibliography, catalogue (with often incomplete archaeological and bib- liographical data) and line-drawings (pp. 160-385) of mostly well published objects.5 The general impression is that of a superficially re- searched, hastily written study not revised for publication. To revise, add and list all corrections would affect major parts of this book. Therefore this review will concentrate on the problem of methodology, contain a few examples to illustrate the points and in a second part explain the reviewers ideas about the image and meaning of the horned crown.6 In her short introduction Iris Furlong states that her chosen subject "Divine Headdresses in the ED Period" has received extensive treatment in studies of iconogra- phy and mythology, but includes no summary of prior results in text or footnote. As reason for re-analysing this particular subject she notes the lack of studies based "on a statistical, quantitative method of investigation". Though Furlong states that this method elucidates "some aspects of the nature and significance" of her subject the actual purpose remains uncertain and it is unclear if the study is typological, iconographical or both. Furlong's reason for including all media with representations of horned crowns is: "... not to restrict the analysis to iconographical repre- sentations only". But all the relevant material is icono- graphical! Comparing this statement to the material re- searched one has the impression that the author is con- fused about the definitions of typology and iconography and that she understands iconography as a synonym for all types of visual media. Applying statistical methods meaningfully depends to a large degree on the character and 'repertoire* of the material, but also on the specific statistical method cho- sen.7 How significant can a statistical analysis be which is 5) cf. note 1. Earlier works by P. Amiet, such as "Problèmes ďiconographie mésopotamienne I" and "II", in: RA 47: 181-185 and RA 48: 32-36 or "Les éléments sumériens et akkadiens du répertoire iconographique de Mésopotamie", in: GENAVA 8: 297-300 might have been helpful to clarify some issues, and especially on ED-glyptic G. Selz, FAOS 11, which covers a wider spectrum than banquet scenes. Furlong's limited knowledge of relevant literature results in misguided interpretations of which I give only one example: The first theme analyzed are scenes with "boatgods" with the result that horned and non-horned persons are both deities or divinized mortals, without any discussion on divinization or a reference to the relevant literature. W.G. Lambert was at the same university! *) Based on: J.M. Asher-Greve, Untersuchungen zur Ikonographie und religionswissenschaftlichen Stellung der sumerischen Göttin Ninhursag in vorakkadischer Zeit , Lizen- tiatsarbeit, Universität Basel, 1973. ') I. Furlong does not elucidate which method she applied; there are different approaches, e.g. D.J. Tugby, "Archaeology and Statistics", in: Brothwell, D. and Higgs, E. (eds.), Science in Archaeology, London 2. ed. 1969: 635-648; M. Kelly-Buccellati and E.S. Elster, OrNS 42, 1973: 195-211; D. Sürenhagen, Keramikproduktion in Habüba-Kabira-Siid, Berlin 1978: 50-54. based on 166 examples of a total 118 artifacts (p. 106) spread over roughly 400 years (ED II to ED Illb/ Akka- dian), i.e. less than 25.45 artifacts per 100 years distrib- uted from northern to southern Mesopotamia as well as Syria? If one determines "significance" by "objective" means such as statistical analysis, it is at least questionable when a chart is based on no more than 2, 3 or 4 objects (p. 116 table no. 6; p. 122 table no. 9; p. 128 table no. 12). Statistical analysis inherently poses many problems, but especially so when, as in this case, exclusively quantita- tive analysis is presented (pp. 1-3), however, the qualita- tive aspect should be stressed; Furlong seems unaware that statistics imply qualitative interpretation and are not inherently more objective than other methodologies. Not uncommon among archaeologists, Furlong is on shaky grounds when she tries to define methods adopted from other fields such as art history. Classification of a theme, motif or symbol is iconography. The study of signifi- cance, development, etc. is a historical-hermeneutic ap- proach known as iconology. Students who want to do research in iconography and iconology should study art historical methodology; unfortunately many archaeolo- gists (and philologists feeling archaeology is easy) work without being familiar with the proper tools. Archaeology is also the study of methodologies! Unfortunately this 'muddled' methology is reflected in the entire study which is primarily "iconological" in approach but with the important omission of "interpreta- tion" of her subject, its specific meaning and historical development. The divine symbol "horn" analysed more or less detached from context and textual evidence is limit- ing. Thus Furlong's study is primarily one of regional typology of horns worn by deities including some ven- tures into iconography (theme) and iconology (semantic functions). Not until page 4, the introduction to Part I "A Com- parative Study of the two Types of Early Dynastic Divine Headdress", is the reader informed of the purpose of this study, i.e. to analyze if the two different forms of divine headdress (Type A and B) can be traced to different regions or different character of its wearer. This is fine, but the reason "(because) no treatment of the subject has been based on a statistical, quantitative method of inves- tigation", and therefore "this method ... has revealed some aspects of the nature and significance of the ED divine headdress which have not so far received consid- eration" is questionable.' Another problem with this study is the chronology: Furlong remarks that Frankfort's 1955 ED periodization based on the Diyala excavations is "most suitable for the purpose of the present statistical analysis" (pp. 1-3). So her largest group is just dated "Early Dynastic" (p. 108 *) Considering the wealth of excellent publications on meth- odology especially over the last 20 years it is surprising that Furlong took no advantage of them.</page><page sequence="3">Reading the Horned Crown 183 table 2); with the exception of 6 figures all others are dated ED III or ED IIIb/Akkadian. The preference of Frankforťs chronology versus a discussion of recent chronological studies and revisions is dubious.9 The reviewer expended considerable time to check errors and omissions (c. 20 pages of notes). To publish these would only be worth it if this book could be recommended to students and scholars. In the reviewers opinion this is not the case. Furlong is more descriptive than analytical, with too little emphasis on examining contexts, comparisons and other results. Since the mate- rial is easily accessible and has been discussed in many publications I don't think detailed comments are neces- sary. The reviewer contributes her own study on "men", "aga" and the horned crown. 2. 'Reading' Visual and Textual Sources 2.1 Introduction The head is the uppermost and chief part of the body. As pars pro toto it may represent the whole person and is used, for instance, in cylinder seal design, the so-called 'Humbaba head',10 ivories representing the 'Woman in the Window',11 or Teumman's head in Assurbanipal's banquet scene.12 Adorning the head with symbols and signs of distinc- tion occurs in most cultures up to contemporary times. Cultures exhibit enormous imagination concerning ob- jects placed on the head. Symbols and signs carried on heads are preeminently visible, therefore making a strong statement. Crowns, tiaras, turbans, hats, feathers become signifiers, often coded and unintelligible to the uninitiated as for example the crown of the Madonna, the crown of thorns or mitre, tiara, and biretta. This tradition originates in ancient cultures that devel- oped formulae to distinguish and signify the heads of deities and humans.13 Horns and horned crowns were 9) A summery of the debate on ED chronology can be found in: N. Karg, BagF 8: 1-5 (listed in Furlong's bibliography). That Frankfort's system is problematic outside the Diyala region has been proven by J. Moon, Iraq 43: 72-74 and J. Börker-Klähn, BagM 11: 33-34; For more recent discussions of ED-glyptic styles see D. Collon, First Impressions, London 1987: 20-31 and H. Martin, Fara , 1988. 10) D.

These formulae - both symbol of and sign for deities in visual contexts - were experimented with from the ED II to the Akkadian periods, when a 'canon' was developed that served (with variations) throughout the next c. 1800 years: single or multiple pairs of horns occasionally sup- plemented by crescent, star or globule.14 Simple horns are signs or symbols but not crowns. A new iconography arose in ED II out of the conceptual change of divinity: the introduction of horns signifying anthropomorphic deities can be interpreted as a change in concept from more feminine divine power(s) to more masculine - horns being adapted from bulls, i.e. a mascu- line element as code for all deities. The emergence of horned deities coincides with the rise of city states and hereditary 'patriarchal' monarchies.15 In visual imagery divine crowns are first attested in the ED II period. The cuneiform sign for 'crown' (MEN) is already found in Uruk IV tablets.16 In Pre-Sargonic economic texts men-crowns were dedicated to several deities and in the Pre-Sargonic version of the Kesh tem- ple hymn men is used in comparison with the city of Kesh.17 That men was worn on the head follows from Pre-Sargonic men-sag-sig-ga, and from Akkadian sag- men or men-sag meaning "head-crown". 18 Another Sumerian term translated with "crown" is aga, but is not attested in Pre-Sargonic texts.19 Early Dynastic horned crowns are the most varied because they include elements that were later abolished.20 Again, I propose that these variations are expressions of RE 3 A2: 2497ff.; A.

Circlet and cap could be made of different materials such as gold, silver, bronze, perhaps reed or wood covered with cloth, inlay or sheet metal.22 Crowns may be composed of different materials; parts were put together or worn on top of each other, thus possibly explaining references to cloth and headbands worn with or under a crown.23 Horns as well as other elements adorning divine crowns could be of different materials than the structure to which they were attached; a Pre-Sargonic text from Tello mentions stones for a crown.24 The more elaborate representations of ED Ilia divine crowns are composed of a rim (circlet) to which a struc- ture (cap or turban) with horns is attached on which 2I) Connotations of headband range from informal cloth band to elaborately ornamental diadem. This article uses the word 'circlet' since Sumerian verbs associated with positioning crowns (men) and circlet (aga) on the head never mean "bind" (keš2) but always "place" or "put" "upon the head"; the most frequent verb is gaL.

According to textual evidence men is the primary and possibly 'generic' term for headdresses signifying divine or supreme status or function. Divine, supreme status and appearance are manifest in the per- sonification of men as a deity,26 and in its metaphorical use in temple hymns27 and Gudea's cylinders.28 men as a generic term may be inferred from references where aga is subjected to men as e.g. in "the diadem (aga), the crown (men) that was placed on the head",29 "your crown (men-zu) is the legitimate crown (aga-zi)",30 "O king, the joy of the head-crown (sag men-na bi-li-bi), Shulgi destined for the legitimate crown (aga-zi)",31 "when the holy crown (men-ku3) existed, but the holy diadem (aga-kUj) did not exist".32 men is worn by, bestowed or placed on the heads of gods, especially Enlil, Enki, Inana, and it is a frequent epithet of Nanna33, whereas aga is rarely used in this context and primarily bestowed on kings together with throne and scepter.34 Further evidence for men as primary term for the divine crown is furnished by its most common adjective which is kUj, "holy". There is almost an one to one ratio between k u3 and all other adjectives together.35 Other adjectives and appositions exclusively used with men are supreme, radiant, brilliant, great, wide, or crown of heaven and earth, crown of the wide heaven, crown of eternity, crown of sovereignty.36 The most frequent adjective for aga is zi, "legitimate, right", the most frequent apposition nam-lugal-la, "king- ship".37 It becomes evident when comparing the adjec- tives and appositions of men and aga that there is a hierarchy within which the majority of adjectives place men in the divine and cosmic sphere. In comparisons men is used as an expression for ultimate beauty or accomplishment, or magnificence (e.g. temples, votive objects), or highlight or culmination of an event (Gudea's cylinders).38 aga is very rarely used in that context, but is associ- ated with destiny,39 and is part of the royal insignia,40 which are an element of the 'cultural essences' (me).41 That men is not one of the me, is not surprising since the divine sphere itself is mentioned in toto (nam-dingir) in line 2 of the list of me and men is to be understood as part of nam-dingir.42 If we proceed chronologically, then men is the only word for divine crown until Shulgi, who is the first king to receive a men-crown.43 The earliest occurrences of aga are in En^eduanna's poetry: It is Inana's task to bestow the diadem (aga), the throne and scepter of kingship;44 Enljeduanna herself wears the 'legitimate dia- dem of En-ship' (aga-zi nam-en-na), which Nanna ") Cf.

Asher-Greve takes away from her.45 Thus we may identify the diadem worn by Enfeeduanna on her disk with aga, a diadem already worn by priestesses in the ED IHb period.46 That aga has to be identified with the diadem worn by Enbeduanna and possibly the cap of Gudea and Urnammu has been suggested.47 But this does not explain why deities wear aga. My suggestion is that aga is the basic circlet, the "diadem" that can be worn either alone, together with, or as part of (rim) the men-crown. S.N. Kramer suggested that "the men-crown may be a meta- phor for en-ship and the aga-crown a metaphor for king- ship".4S This conforms with the evidence that men is never the crown of kingship, but does not explain why aga and men may both be the crown of en-ship.49 It has been suggested that the rulers of Uruk were En- priests with worldly powers and that they are represented by the male figure wearing a diadem very similar to En^eduanna's. Several later texts refer to men as being the 'crown' of Ens and early, mythological kings of Uruk.50 Perhaps men originally symbolized both divine and worldly powers, presumably personified in the En of Uruk. The Pre-Sargonic period, lacking a word for 'divine crown', adopted men with that meaning, the pictorial equivalent representing the En's circlet with attached horns.51 A further distinction might have been made be- tween En-priests who continued to hold men and En- priestesses who hold aga.S2 Thus eventually the Ur III kings, in presenting the mythical En- kings of Uruk as their ancestors or brothers, took over the men-crown as part of that tradition. As mentioned, aga frequently is associated with zi, "legitimate, right", nam-lugal, "kingship" and, though less frequently, nam-en-na, "En-ship", aga is, there- fore, primarily a symbol of worldly office, kingship and En-ship, men is predominantly associated with the di- vine, cosmic and mythical sphere, thus when the kings are deified or elevated to that sphere (e.g. in the sacred marriage ritual) they are metaphorically endowed with a 4S) W.W.

I propose that the center piece is the frontal depic- tion of a mask.57 The closest parallels to these mask silhouettes are lion heads such as on the silver vase of Entemena,58 the votive plaque of Dudu,59 the maceheads of Mesilim60 and Eannatum,61 inlays from Ur42 and a votive plaque from Nippur63 (Plate 1). Emphasis is put on eyes and nose, the mouth is omitted. Therefore I suggest that the center piece on the crowns represents a styUzed lion mask. A crescent or horns adorn some of the lion masks, in one case (Plate 1 Fig. 2.3) a miniature three- pointed crown repeats the three projections of the under- lying major crown. I interpret these forms as precursors of Akkadian crowns with multiple horns. But what do these elements signify? Metaphors of divine attributes, the identity of deities or numinous sym- bols? R.M. Boehmer in his study of Akkadian cylinder seals qualified deities associated with grain as "Frucht- barkeitsgottheiten".64 But this interpretation does not ap- ply to our ED images.

Where texts are inscribed grain goddesses are not mentioned. Grain, therefore, has to signify something else. Grain was the primary source of Sumer's wealth. Ezinu, the deified grain, is compared to fei-li and be2-gal2, both meaning abundance.66 Creat- ing abundance is one of the major tasks of many deities, equally abundance (fei -li) is a frequent attribute of dei- ties.67 In Neo-Sumerian and Old-Babylonian royal hymns J) i -li is an attribute of men.68 Incorporating grain into the divine crown as a visual code of fri -li signifies the deities' powers over the prosperity of the country and renders grain as a metaphor for abundance. In the introduction to this chapter I mention that horns are a cross-cultural metaphor for power, strength and potency.69 The hon mask on the horned crowns fulfills another task. Though the hon symbolizes power and strength especially when used as metaphor of divine heads,70 it is also used as a metaphor for awe and terrify- ing splendor (ni2 and me-iam^.71 The most remarkable feature of the lion's mask are the eyes (Plate 1) whose awe inspiring quality (buš) is sometimes mentioned.72 For ni2, me-lara, and &amp;u š E. Cassin coined the phrase "splendeur divine"; these are expressions of numinous power and radiance. That the numinous is located with the head can be inferred from some texts: Nanna and Enlil lift their head in terrifying splendor, and Ninisina who lifts her head in terrifying splendor is endowed with awe.73 Some lion's masks are crowned by horns or a crescent, and in one case a miniature crown (Plate 1, 2.3) which emphasizes the numinous. Lion masks with occasionally accentuated eyes are the visual code for terrifying splendor' and 'awe' , probably reflecting a metaphor in the oral poetic tradition subse- quently appearing in literature.74 A review article on a study of divine headdresses in the Early Dynastic Period does not permit analysis of the representation of deities in that period. But my analysis of men and aga was originally part of a study of the mothergoddess NinJjursag and I want to stress that in- depth analysis of image and text brings us much further in identifying deities on ED representations than was possible in the limited context of this article.
