Like Schindler's List, the list of endangered species in- cludes organisms we are trying to protect from almost certain annihilation. Both represent heroic, noble, and yet woefully inadequate attempts to do something in the face of an overpowering, callous disrespect for life. Just as Oskar Schindler did manage to save 1100 Jews (Keneally 1993) out of over 6 million (0.018%), our ef- forts may possibly also save a few species out of thou- sands. But there is a perverse difference. Schindler's List was an attempt to protect Homo sapiens from them- selves. Can a species that persecutes its own kind with such ghastly atrocities be able to save other species? It is almost as if H. sapiens were two species, one with a rev- erence for life and the other with a contempt for it. But this is exactly the kind of us-versus-them thinking that fosters violence and wars, so it must be abandoned. Schindler was successful in his venture because he went along with the corrupt system and adroitly exploited its weaknesses. He did not fight the Nazis; he remained one of them. He worked on his mission and tolerated all the horrors occurring around him. Can conservation biology employ a similar approach? Would we stand a better chance for success if we were to go with the flow? The flow is clearly toward the deci- mation of biodiversity. As humans persist in their domi- nation of natural landscapes, there can be no doubt that H. sapiens is the keystone species on Earth. There is a saying on Wall Street, "Don't fight the tape," which means that when the stock market is moving, either up or down, denial is folly and it can be richly rewarding to go with the flow. The trick is knowing when to bail out. Conservation biology is fighting the tape. The Earth is ex- periencing a secular bull market of aliens. They are tak- ing over a considerable share of the biosphere in spite of all we do to stop them. Although human commerce has been mixing up species for centuries, the intensity of the stirring is much greater today. Perhaps the solution to preserving biodiversity lies in harnessing the bull market species to work for us; indeed, they already do. Judging by their collective actions, humans want to eradicate biodiversity but seem unable to do it alone, so they enlist the aid of helper species-aliens. We trans- port them into new areas where they take over and crowd out indigenous species. Alien species are the Gestapo of ecology. They carry out the final solution to the biodiversity problem. They help humanity reduce biodiversity. Accordingly, the conservation community treats them as adversaries. The Nature Conservancy has recently published a rogues gallery of the top 12 least- wanted aliens (Flack &amp; Furlow 1996). This is a denial of reality. Schindler would do otherwise. We supporters of biodiversity can treat aliens as foes, but we must recog- nize that most of our fellow humans, including those who do not understand or care, foster these helpers as their indentured vassals. Another category of helper species includes not aliens but natives. These species prosper because of human ac- tivities. Morris and Heidinga (1997) call them "anthro- pogenic." They are not so readily noticeable precisely because they are natives. We become aware of them only when they become nuisances. Crows, cowbirds, and Canada Geese are familiar avian examples. White- tailed deer and skunks are suburban pests. Some are not so familiar but have begun to have adverse effects on biodiversity; for example, the Snow Goose has tripled its population in the past three decades due to increased rice farming in the south and expanded wildlife refuges in the northern prairies (Rockwell et al. 1996). When on its breeding grounds in the Arctic it overwhelms other smaller species, such as sandpipers. Landfills have fos- tered overblown populations of gulls to the detriment of terns. Highways and their associated roadkill have pro- duced new linear ecological zones where the energy driving the system comes from the petroleum fuels that propel the vehicles that collide with the animals on the pavement. The organisms living on these roadkills can attain populations out of proportion to their original dis- Paper submitted March 10, 1997; revised manuscript accepted May 7, 1997. 485 Conservation Biology, Pages 485-486 Volume 12, No. 2, April 1998</page><page sequence="2">486 The ESA and Schindler's List Windsor tribution. The examples are many but hard to define quantitatively because they are natives for which base- line data are often not available. It may be that conservation biology will eventually have to pit anthropogenic species against aliens to achieve some new sort of balance. Phragmites may take over a wetland, but when a road is constructed through it, the roadkill ecozone may mitigate the monoculture of Phragmites. A cornfield that once devastated several species of grassland birds may be replaced with an air- port that allows grassland birds to return but that kills some of them as runway strikes (a three-dimensional spread on the highway ecozone). Morris and Heidinga (1997) have begun an inventory of the species that are thriving because of human activi- ties. Our endangered species list identifies those that are suffering. Now we must see if correlations can be found between the thrivers and the sufferers. Can alien and anthropomorphic species be exploited to assist declin- ing native species? Several misguided attempts have been made in the past when aliens have been intro- duced into wild environments. This is clearly wrong. In areas that are no longer wild, however, such attempts might be beneficial. Good candidates are urban and sub- urban habitats, industrial and transportation sites (facto- ries, railways, highways, airports), shopping malls, golf courses, race tracks, and both educational and govern- mental campuses. Too often these areas are planted by commercial landscapers whose only noneconomic inter- est is beautification. These human sites occupy an enor- mous acreage and seem to be proliferating at a frightening clip. Applying conservation biology to their landscaping could extend suitable habitats to endangered and threat- ened species. In other words, what would it take to encourage some of our native species, such as warblers, to breed in areas occupied by humans? Some obvious answers come to mind, such as planting very thorny trees and shrubs to discourage cats and children. Multiflora rose, haw- thorns, and wild honey locust are particularly effective. Poison ivy is not only a deeply rooted stabilizer of sand dunes but is also a great discourager of human trespass. Aquatic aliens such as Hydrilla are cursed by naturalists, but could they be exploited to discourage power boats? If not, what other aquatic nuisance could be cultivated to snarl boat propellers? Could living fences of Phrag- mites be employed to keep boaters away from nesting loons? Many birds suffer from nest predators such as crows; are there any endangered or threatened species that prosper when the crow population soars? Starlings usurp holes, leaving native cavity nesters stranded; are there some alien trees in which starlings will not nest but native species would or that starlings would prefer? The list of possibilities could go on. Species that are thriving-alien or native-should be coupled with native species that are suffering. This concept reaches far be- yond the notion of using "natural enemies" to manage unwanted species because it attempts to exploit pro- cesses already underway in the drastic modification of habitat. Aliens are not going to go away, nor are those natives we foster. We have to figure out sneaky ways to exploit them, to recruit them for our team. We can either take charge or submit to their leadership. Schin- dler took charge by aligning his goals with those of the power structure. What he did was not easy either.
