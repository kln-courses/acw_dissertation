COLE AWARD FOR AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING INNOVATION The SAE Edward N. Cole Award for Automotive Engineer- ing Innovation was established by the SAE Board of Direc- tors in 1978. The Award is intended to honor the memory of Mr. Cole and the inspiration he provided to others in the engineering profession by his continuing search and drive for product innovation. It also recognizes Mr. Cole's own achievements in a number of automotive engineering fields. To perpetuate recognition of Mr. Cole's accomplishments and dedication as an automotive engineer, the Society of Automotive Engineers administers an annual award which recognizes individuals whose work and achievements exem- plify, in an outstanding manner, innovation in the engineer- ing development of automobiles, their components, systems, and accessories. The Cole Award fund was launched by contributions from General Motors SAE members, both active and retired. With so many friends it was soon extended to others in the in- dustry who knew and cherished him. Alan G. L oof b our row Chrysler Corp. (Retired) Mr. Loofbourrow, former Vice President - Engineering, Chrysler Corporation was selected by the Board after an in- tensive consideration of a number of highly qualified nomi- nees. Loofbourrow has an outstanding record of creativity and innovation in the automotive field. He has 19 patents and was elected to SAE's Fellow grade of membership in December 1977. Mr. Loofbourrow was cited for a distin- guished career as an inventor, engineering manager, and automotive industry spokesman. From his early inventions in power steering and automatic transmissions to his efforts in spearheading Chrysler's introduction of electronic ignition systems and the Lean Burn engines, he has consistently been an innovator. He was a strong proponent of Chrysler's de- velopment programs in electronics; advanced suspension systems; and in safety, emissions control, and fuel economy. In April 1977, Loofbourrow was elected a member in the National Academy of Engineering, and in June 1972, he was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree by Ohio State University. Mr. Loofbourrow is the fourth recipient of the Cole Award; previous recipients were Oliver K. Kelly, honored in 1979, Achilles C. Sampietro in 1980, and George H. Muller in 1981. xxvii</page><page sequence="7">HORNING MEMORIAL AWARD The Horning Memorial Award is granted annually to the author of the best paper relating to the adaptation of fuels and internal combustion engines which has been presented at a meeting of the Society during the calendar year. Papers are judged primarily for their value as new contributions to existing knowledge of the art of such adaptation. As an alternative selection, the Board of Award may select as the recipient an individual for recognition of his distin- guished active service in the field of mutual adaptation of fuels and engines. In addition to receiving the Award, the recipient must present a Horning Memorial Lecture at a de- signated meeting of the Society. Mr. Harry Ļ. Horning was deeply interested in the estab- lishment of a cooperative agency devoted to the mutual adaptation of fuels and internal combustion engines, includ- ing the development of an internationally recognized stan- dard for testing fuels. He was a major force in the movement to bring the automotive and petroleum industries together to deal with the fuels problem. His dedication to this inter- relationship is preserved by the Horning Memorial Award as a motivation for others who follow in his footsteps. Fuel Droplets inside the Cylinder of a Spark Ignition Engine with Axial Stratification- 820132 An axially stratified, fuel-air mixture can be produced in an engine cylinder using inlet-port fuel injection and air swirl. Past work has shown that stratification decreased as fuel volatility decreased. This paper shows that the reason for this relationship is the entry of fuel droplets into the cylinder prior to the start of fuel injection. This phenome- non, presumably caused by wall wetting in the inlet port, increased the mixing of the fuel and air which reduced the stratification. Also, it was shown that (a) droplets were not uniformly distributed throughout the cylinder, (b) droplets were completely vaporized prior to ignition, and (c) the largest droplets entered the cylinder under low inlet flow conditions. Bruce D. Peters General Motors Research Laboratories Bruce D. Peters, Staff Research Engineer at the General Motors Research Labs received his B.S.M.E. from the Uni- versity of Minnesota in 1966.

His current assignment in- volves conducting automotive research in the area of internal combustion engines. He has been an SAE member since 1966 and has authored several technical papers dealing with fuels, emissions, and combustion. xxviii</page><page sequence="8">RALPH H. ISBRANDT AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY ENGINEERING AWARD The purpose of the Ralph H. Isbrandt Automotive Safety Engineering Award is to help focus the attention of SAE members in the field of automotive safety engineering by recognizing outstanding contributions to this field. The Award is presented annually to the author, or authors, who deliver the most outstanding paper(s) at Society or Section meetings addressed to the subject of automotive safety en- gineering or to those who make outstanding contributions in that field.

During his forty-five year automotive career, Mr. Isbrandt provided a constant inspiration to young engineers seeking and follow- ing an automotive engineering career. Proposal for a Thorax Tolerance Level in Side Im- pacts Based on 62 Tests Performed With Cadavers Having Known Bone Condition- 821157 A large number of experiments involving cadavers - includ- ing real-world-accident reconstructions - have been per- formed for the purpose of enhancing the state of knowledge concerning tolerance levels and protection criteria relevant to side-impact conditions. However, the scatter of the find- ings, as well as the considerable differences in injury severity levels (differences that cannot be accounted for by age dif- ferences alone) have limited the conclusions that it was pos- sible to draw from these investigations in terms of criteria, mainly concerning thoracic protection. The major cause of scatter is the considerable differences in skeleton quality between subjects. Analysis of the rib characterization test findings made it possible to define a thoracic resistance index enabling the establishment of a classification of subjects. This index, which was validated with our sample, allowed us to evaluate the pertinence of the various side-impact protection criteria considered. When this index is used, thoracic deflection, in particular, emerges as a satisfactory criterion for predicting the risk of occur- rence of rib fractures in side-impact collisions. The transpo- sition of this criterion to dummies is consequently made possible, and is discussed. J. Sacreste Peugeot S.A./Renault J.

The first part was a parametric study to select promising inlet concepts. A wide range of in- let geometries was examined and evaluated - primarily on the basis of cruise thrust and fuel burn performance. Two inlet concepts were then chosen for more detailed design studies - one appropriate to offset engine/gearbox arrange- ments and the other to in-line arrangements. In the second part of this study, inlet design points were chosen to optimize the net installed thrust, and detailed de- sign of the two inlet configurations was performed. An ana- lytical methodology was developed to account for prop- fan slipstream effects, transonic flow effects, and three- dimensional geometry effects. Using this methodology, low drag cowls were designed for the two inlets. B. Hugh Little Lockheed-Georgia Co. Mr. B.

COLWELL MERIT AWARD Recognizing that more than one truly outstanding techni- cal paper may be presented in a given year, there is no re- striction in this Award on the number of authors who may be honored. Rather, the Award is presented to all who have demonstrated, by the quality of their technical paper, a de- gree of professionalism that leaves no cause for criticism. The emphasis in judging for the Award lies heavily on the originality of the contribution to automotive engineering, as well as on the excellence of presentation. This is in recog- nition of the necessity for the technical community to es- tablish clear and concise lines of communication. There is no restriction on subject. Arch T. Colwell himself was a prime example of the desire for excellence in development and presentation of technical papers. During his career as vice president of Thompson Products Inc. and later in the succeeding TRW Inc. he per- sonally followed the creation of each technical paper de- veloped by the company's engineers to see that it was a credit both to the best talents to the individual and project it represented. The Award which he established aims to en- courage this sense of professionalism in the engineering pro- fession. The Axially-Stratified-Charge Engine- 820131 A method to stratify the fuel-air mixture along the cylinder axis of engines is described. Axial stratification, with the richest mixture near the top of the combustion chamber and the leanest mixture near the piston top, was obtained by imparting swirl to the intake air and by injecting fuel into the inlet port just before the end of the intake stroke. Axial stratification was developed in both single and multi-cylinder engines over the range of operating conditions tested. A production four-cylinder engine modified to operate with axially-stratified-charge, showed: increased combustion stability and tolerance to dilute mixtures; decreased fuel consumption; similar HC and CO emissions; lower NO emis- sions and octane requirement when compared with the un- modified engine operated at the same overall equivalence ratio.

Experi- ments conducted in a subsonic wind tunnel (1 ft x 2 ft test section) have established the feasibility and practicality of the concept. A test program utilizing three geometrically similar automotive-type models of cross-sectional area corre- sponding to conventional model/tunnel blockages of 10%, 20%, and 30% was conducted with the models positioned at zero yaw and 10 degrees yaw angle. Pressure distribution data obtained using the adaptive test section demonstrated the effective elimination of wall interference by properly deforming the tunnel walls using the adaptive-wall technique. These experimental tests have shown that the adaptive-wall test section concept will allow significantly larger blockage ratios than permissible in conventional wind tunnels to be tested with negligible wall interference. *U.S. Patent Pending - Application Serial No. 99,157; Sver- drup Technology, Inc.; Filing Date: November 30, 1979.

As particulate mass accumulates on the filter, a small change in the frequency of oscillation, directly related to mass, is detected in real-time. As described in this study TEOM sensitivity on the order of 5x1 0"8 g-sec-1 may be achieved over sample periods of 8-1 5 seconds. Two light duty diesel vehicles were tested using FTP-Bag III and NYCC driving schedules.

Frontal sled tests conducted at 19-37 km/h investi- gated the Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy interaction with a ball-sleeve column steering assembly over a range of column angles and surrogate postures. Neither column com- pression nor steering wheel deformation correlated with the mechanical severity of the test surrogate interaction with the steering system. The steering wheel deformed before the column compressed and the degree of wheel deformation strongly depended on the surrogate load distribution, the steering wheel being an important energy absorbing element. Analysis of 154 frontal towaway accidents involving GM cars further confirmed that although steering wheel defor- mation and column compression may be indicative of occu- pant loading, they do not necessarily indicate the severity of the driver interaction with the steering system.

Specific tests were devised to show the noise source to be associated with piston and ring friction. It was concluded that the noise was caused by a "stick-slip" action of the piston assembly as the piston reversed direction at the top and bottom if its' stroke. The instantaneous change between static and dynamic coefficients of friction resulted in an abrupt force reaction, which excited the crankshaft's natural frequencies. Design parameters were optimized to provide a 10 dB(A) (A-weighted sound level) reduction of noise at idle. John M. Beard more General Motors Corp.

Comparison of Aldehyde Methods- 820965 Three widely documented methods for the analysis of aliphatic aldehydes in air, i.e., chromotropic acid, 3-methyl- 2-benzothiazolone hydrazone (MBTH) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone (DNPH), and a modified version of the MBTH method are frequently used for the analysis of aldehydes in diluted diesel exhaust. In order to assess their relative accu- racy for analysis of aldehydes in such a matrix, a side-by-side comparison of the methods was conducted. The equivalent accuracy of the chromotropic acid, MBTH and DNPH methods for analysis of formaldehyde in a clean air matrix was confirmed and a negative bias in the MBTH method as a result of SO2 interference was documented. A comparison of the concentrations of formaldehyde and ali- phatic aldehydes in diluted diesel exhaust measured by the four methods indicates that significant differences exist be- tween several of them. The concentration of formaldehyde measured by the chromotropic acid and DNPH methods is statistically equivalent while aliphatic aldehyde concentra- tions increase (limited statistical significance) in the follow- ing order: MBTH ^DNPH^ modified MBTH.

A review of the history of predictive noise control in gearboxes is given. The historical lead is followed in developing the strategy, but significant changes in the approach to predictive noise control have been made. The heart of the approach is the dynamic modeling of the gearbox from inside out. Thus one must start this process with the prediction of the internal dynamic response of the gear train system. This paper then details the computational strategy for the determination of the dynamic response of the internal gear- box components. The approaches presented here are signifi- cant departures from those carried out in the past. Larry D. Mitchell Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.

The aim of this study is to make clear the influence of re- tained austenite content on the pitting and on the bending fatigue, and also to develop a heat treating process which enables quantitative control of retained austenite on the surface of gears. The gears treated by the newly developed carbonitriding process to contain 60-70% retained austenite in the surface achieved a pitting life almost three times longer than those subjected to conventional carburizing without any bending fatigue failure.

However, the scatter of the find- ings, as well as the considerable differences in injury severity levels (differences that cannot be accounted for by age dif- ferences alone) have limited the conclusions that it was pos- sible to draw from these investigations in terms of criteria, mainly concerning thoracic protection. The major cause of scatter is the considerable differences in skeleton quality between subjects. Analysis of the rib characterization test findings made it possible to define a thoracic resistance index enabling the establishment of a classification of subjects. This index, which was validated with our sample, allowed us to evaluate the pertinence of the various side-impact protection criteria considered. When this index is used, thoracic deflection, in particular, emerges as a satisfactory criterion for predicting the risk of occur- rence of rib fractures in side-impact collisions. The transpo- sition of this criterion to dummies is consequently made possible, and is discussed. J. Sacreste Peugeot S.A./Renault J.

The particulate collection filter tempera- ture, soluble organic fraction (SOF) and solids fraction (SOL) of diesel particulate matter were predicted based on exhaust system and dilution tunnel variables that could be measured on a real-time basis. The SOF was assumed to be formed by adsorption of gaseous hydrocarbons onto the solids fraction. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparison to experimentally measured values. The model was able to predict SOF concentrations within 35%, filter temperatures within 3°C, and particulate (SOF + SOL) concentrations within 25% of measured values. A parametric study was conducted using the developed model; and im- proved test procedures, dilution tunnel dimensions, and federal testing guidelines were suggested. James C.
