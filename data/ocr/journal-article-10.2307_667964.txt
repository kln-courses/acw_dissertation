Ritual Purification of a Balinese Temple. J. H. HOOYKAAS-VAN LEEUWEN BOOMKAMP. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1960. 81 pp., glossary, 44 illustra- tions, index, 16 plates. $3.60. Reviewed by JANE BELO, New York City This scholarly little monograph treats of Balinese religion in the only way it can be treated, in profuse detail as to the offerings and instruments of the purification ritual. The author describes the composition of the lis, the broom-like holy water sprinkler made from young palm leaf, intricately cut out and plaited in symbolic forms. These include anthropomorphic components, such as breast bone, ribs, old belly, young belly, navel, liver, and other symbols such as "stairway up" and "stairway down," various sacred trees and grasses. Besides the description of the components, Dr. Hooykaas in- cludes drawings of some 43 of them, beautifully executed by a Balinese artist, Ida Bagus Anom of Ubud. She consulted religious manuals used by the priests both from private sources and from the libraries in Holland and in Bali, finding in 13 different manuscripts the mantra lis, or prayer formulae as hymns of praise to the lis. She gives the orignals and the English translation with careful cross-referencing of the various texts. A second part of the monograph deals with the ritual objects required when a Brahman Padanda or High Priest officiates to make the holy water. These include miniature tools and utensils made of wood and bamboo, and terra cotta replicas of various offerings, numbering in all 78. Photographs of such a set are reproduced from the collection at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The whole study bears witness to the continuing interest of Dutch scholars in Indonesia, and to the cooperation of Indonesian and European students of the religion and the culture. No suggestion is made of the possibly compulsive nature of the requirements for purification, which some observers remark upon. Dr. Hooykaas states that she hopes she has succeeded in conveying "something of the religious feeling, the creative capacity, and imaginative ingenuity, which characterize the culture of Bali." The Arts of Thailand: A Handbook of the Architecture, Sculpture and Painting of Thai- land (Siam). THEODORE BOWIE (Ed.) Introduction by H. H. DHANI NIVAT KROMA- MUN BIDYALABH. Acknowledgements by HERMAN B. WELLS. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1960. 219 pp., bibliography, exhibition catalogue, frontispiece (color), index, 1 map, 163 photographs and figures. $8.95. Reviewed by MICHAEL MOER MAN, Yale University This is really three books in one. It is a catalogue of the Arts of Thailand exhibition (pp. 183-213), a major study of Thai Buddhist sculpture and architecture (pp. 25-157), and "A Note on Thai Painting" (pp. 166-174). The book's unity comes from the con- sistency of Thai Buddhist art and through excellent marginal and textual cross-refer- ences to plates and catalogue numbers. Many of Prince Subhadradis' catalogue notes furnish interesting information about Thai iconography and religious behavior. Succinct description and references to plates and text make the notes useful even in the absence of the exhibition for which they were written.</page></plain_text>
