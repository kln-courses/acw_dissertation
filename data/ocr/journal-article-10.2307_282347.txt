<plain_text><page sequence="1">RADIOCARBON DATES ON THE ALL AMERICAN MAN PICTOGRAPH Scott D. Chaffee, Marian Hyman, Marvin W. Rowe, Nancy J. Coulam, Alan Schroedl, and Kathleen Hogue Controversy has surrounded the All American Man pictograph in southeast Utah since its discovery in the 1950s. Its coloration, similar to the flag of the United States of America, has led to questions regarding its authenticity. We have obtained two radiocarbon values on a single sample comprised of pigmented sandstone fragments from one small area of this pictograph. They suggest the pictograph dates to the fourteenth century and indicate that it is an authentic, prehistoric pictograph, probably Anasazi in origin. La pictografia "El Hombre todo Americano" (the All American Man), localizada en el sureste de Utah, Estados Unidos, ha estado rodeada de controversia desde su descubrimiento en los anos cinquenta. Su coloraci6n, semejante a la de la bandera estadunidense, ha sembrado dudas sobre su autenticidad. Nosotros hemos obtenido dosfechados radiocarb6nicos en una sola muestra que consta de fragmentos pigmentados de piedra arenisca, tomada de una pequeia drea de esta pictografia. Estos fechados sugieren que la pictografia data del siglo XIV, e indican que es una pictografia autentica y prehist6rica, probablemente de origen anasazi. The All American Man (Figure 1) is a red, white, and blue striped shield-bearing pictograph located in an Anasazi alcove habitation site (42SA 1614) in southeastern Utah (Figure 2). In addition to the All American Man shield-bearing figure, 19 Anasazi-style striated and stylized handprints, and some miscellaneous lines and colored areas are present. The All American Man is superimposed on four red ochre-colored handprints. This superimposition, plus the resemblance of the stripes in the figure to the American flag, have led some viewers to conclude the All American Man was painted historically rather than prehistorically. Others have suggested the All American Man and other unusual, nearby figures and motifs were painted by Mesa Verde Anasazi who borrowed Fremont rock-art motifs (Sharrock 1966) or by Fremont peoples who traveled through Mesa Verde Anasazi territory (Ambler 1970) or who reoccupied abandoned Anasazi sites (Geib and Fairley 1992). The color combination and arrangement of stripes of the All American Man are, however, rare for either a Fremont or an Anasazi pictograph. The unusual style, coupled with several persons' claims to have painted the whole figure or to have embellished portions of a prehistoric figure to make it look like the American flag (Spangler 1989), have led many archaeologists to consider it a historic fake. During proceedings to acquire the area that includes the All American Man as part of Canyonlands National Park, this contention was dropped when an archaeologist testified to its probable authenticity (Smith with Long 1980:115). The debate continues, but direct radiocarbon dates from the pictograph should help settle the question of the age of the All American Man. THE SITE AND THE PROBLEM The All American Man site (42SA1614) lies about 35 km east of the Colorado River, in one of the rare canyons in this arid region containing alluvium and permanent water.

The inset shows an enlarged schematic cross-sectional view of the spall area where the sample flakes were recovered (not drawn to scale). pictographs are associated with a typicate th a typical lat Pueblo II-Pueblo III western Anasazi alcove habitation and storage site. Two standing, wet-laid structures are present in the site. Both are one-story, semi- D-shaped constructions, with the side walls of the alcove forming rear walls of the two opposing structures. Wall foundations are double coursed, with the upper courses of simple, relatively crude masonry construction using unshaped pieces of tabular sandstone. The ratio of mortar to stone is higher than normal for the Mesa Verde core area, but lower than normal for the Kayenta core area. One structure encloses 5.3 m2 with 2.75 m of headroom; the other encloses 2.8 m2 with 1.75 m headroom. Wall remnants indicate that at least one other small storage structure was present, along with a retaining wall across the front of the alcovfront of the alcove to create a level floor in front of the habitation rooms and below the rock art. The structures were probably not used for very long, judging by the limited amounts of trash and fill, but presence of midden plus smoke blackening on the ceiling of the alcove indicate the structures were used for more than storage. During Sharrock's (1966) initial recording of the site, he collected and classified 21 sherds as McElmo and Mancos Black-on-white, undifferentiated Mesa Verde Black-on-white, Mesa Verde and Mancos corrugated, and a single Turner Gray, Emery variety Fremont sherd. These sherds have not been reanalyzed in the context of modern typologies; other sherds are no longer available because they have all been stolen by park visitors. In sum, structures, construction styles, and artifacts in the site are fairly typical of a late Pueblo II-Pueblo III western Anasazi alcove habitation site. In the 1960s when the site was recorded, shield figures such as the All American Man pictograph, along with horned dancers and ghost figures, were considered diagnostic of the Fremont culture (Sharrock 1966; Wormington 1955). We now recognize that Barrier Canyon style ghost figures are 770 [Vol. 59, No. 4, 1994]</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS - ', X , , \ . V ^ ' !: e " /E' ;"' ^'-....

Gebhard 1966; Loendorf 1990; Schaafsma 1980; Wormington 1955). The uncertain association of shield figures to the Fremont, coupled with the general lack of other physical evidence of Fremont traits at the All American Man site and in the area south of the Colorado River provides little support for interpreting the pictograph as evidence of Fremont migration, imitation, or even Fremont influence. Direct radiocarbon dates on the pictograph could provide data on the affiliation of the All American Man pictograph. Additionally, radiocarbon dates can provide evidene for testing whether the pictograph is prehistoric or a modern fake. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Sample Description The Cedar Mesa sandstone surface on which the All American Man pictograph was painted has been exfoliating due to natural processes of mineralization and movement of fluid through the sandstone. Over the years, a portion of the blue-painted sandstone lifted away from the underlying rock of the All American Man, allowing spalled and pigmented flakes to be trapped behind it. The inset in Figure 1 shows an enlarged, cross-sectional, schematic view of the spalled, right side of the top blue quadrant of the shield where our pigment sample was obtained. Part of the pigment sample was examined by David Scott (personal communication 1992) of the Getty Conservation Institute, who reported to us that the blue pigment contained charcoal. We confirmed his assessment by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Beyond examining the flakes under an optical microscope to ensure that there was no obvious modern contamination from fabric fibers, threads, rootlets, etc. (and none was seen), no further sample preparation was necessary. Petrographic Analyses Methods used to analyze the composition of the pigment and its underlying material include: (1) optical microscopy; (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to conduct semiquantitative chemical analysis and view the microstructure of the sample; and (3) x-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the mineral composition of the white material observed in two contexts. 771</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 3. An optical microphotograph of a cross section of one of the sample flakes from the All American Man. This particular flake had been partially reacted during an earlier, failed dating experiment. Thus, there is no longer a uniform pigment layer covering the flake. The areas of charcoal pigment are labeled (a), the natural gypsum and calcium oxalate layer underlying the charcoal pigment is labeled (b), and the basal Cedar Mesa Sandstone is labeled (c). Optical Microscopy. We typically prepare a polished section of each pictograph sample in order to determine its suitability for dating and carefully examine the microstratigraphy of the accretion, pigment, and basal rock substrate layers. Examination of the thin section with an optical microscope is used to confirm that there is no overpainting (which could seriously complicate the interpretation of any date obtained on the sample). We only attempt to date pictographs with no evidence of overpainting. In this case, a single charcoal paint layer was apparent from observation of the cross section. Although the pigment appears black on our sample pieces, under the microscope very-fine-grained white particles were seen to be intermixed in with the charcoal (the sandstone itself is reddish). We could not ascertain whether these particles were added with the charcoal or were a natural deposition. In some places, the charcoal layer was underlain by a relatively thick white layer that appears to occur naturally. Figure 3 shows a microphotograph of the painted surface and the naturally occurring white layer. Scanning Electron Microscopy. Using the x-ray dispersive (EDS) capabilities of the SEM, a high concentration of calcium and sulfur were noted for the relatively thick white underlayer illustrated in Figure 4. The SEM microphotograph in Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional view of the surface layer. Two distinct regions can be seen. The tabular, rhombic form characteristic of gypsum (hydrous calcium sulfate) is seen underlying the upper region that is primarily made up of fine-grained whewellite (calcium oxalate dihydrate). EDS semiquantitative analysis confirmed this visual as- sessment. Such deposits form from fluids moving in the sandstone, and there is no reason to think that this layer is other than natural (Cooke and Smalley 1968). The production of these minerals probably plays a critical role in the exfoliation process. X-ray Diffraction. After the charcoal was removed from the sample by conversion to gaseous carbon dioxide during the plasma-extraction process (described below), a fine-grained, dispersed white layer was apparent on the surface of the sandstone. Also observable underneath the charcoal layer was a thicker coherent white layer. A mixture of both types of white material was scraped off a sample of the pictograph and analyzed by XRD to determine the mineral composition of the two distinct white substances. The resulting spectrum is shown in Figure 5. Three primary minerals were present: (1) quartz, as expected from the Cedar Mesa Sandstone; (2) bassinite, a calcium sulfate 772 [Vol. 59, No. 4, 1994]</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS Figure 4.

The XRD analysis confirms the SEM assignments for the mineralogy of this white deposit. Plasma System The plasma system has been described elsewhere (Chaffee et al. 1993; Russ et al. 1990, 1991, 1992). Sample introduction into the plasma system is through a copper-gasketed metal miniflange capable of maintaining an ultra-high vacuum seal against the atmosphere. We use high-vacuum construction throughout the reaction chamber and associated vacuum system in order to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide contamination at a minimum. The reaction chamber is not in contact with any organic materials; all surfaces seen by the plasma are either borosilicate glass or metal. Power is supplied to the plasma chamber by a 1,500-watt radio frequency (RF) generator through a matching network used to tune the power and two external aluminum electrodes that surround the chamber. A copper oxide furnace, which has previously been thoroughly outgassed to remove any trace of atmospheric carbon dioxide, produces pure oxygen when heated to -900?C. The plasma system pressure is measured using either a thermistor gauge or a Bayard-Alpert ionization gauge, depending on the pressure. All vacuum pumping is conducted through oil-free pumps to avoid any possibility of oil back-streaming into the reaction chamber. Two liquid-nitrogen sorption pumps are used sequentially to achieve pressures of c 10-5 torr. An ion pump is used to obtain high vacuum (_ 10-8 torr). Plasma Cleaning of System Prior to inserting the All American Man sample into the oxygen plasma-extraction system, we cleaned the empty reaction chamber with four oxygen plasma runs to react away residual organic carbon contamination present in the chamber. Between each plasma run, the system was pumped down to high vacuum to remove any contaminant carbon dioxide produced during that cleaning step. After the fourth plasma-cleaning run, there was no discernible carbon dioxide pressure mea- sured on a CVC thermister pressure gauge that reads from c millitorr to atmospheric pressure (760 torr). Thus, there was &lt; 1 millitorr of carbon dioxide present. To determine the amount of carbon from carbon dioxide pressure in the system, we use the ideal gas law, PV= nRT, whethe carbon dioxide pre Pssure, the carbon dioxide pressure, system volume, Tthe temperature, and R the universal gas constant. This allows us to calculate n, the number of moles of carbon dioxide, from which the weight of carbon can be calculated. In the plasma system used for this experiment, 740 millitorr of carbon dioxide corresponds to approximately 1 mg of carbon. Assuming that all of the residual background pressure (&lt; 1 millitorr) was due to carbon dioxide provides the worst possible case, but this is unlikely because water and nitrogen oxides are probably present as well. Even so, this worst case would correspond to &lt; .0014 milligrams of carbon contamination which, for a small but datable sample of. 1 mg, would be less than 1.4 percent modern contamination. For a 700-year-old sample, a 1.4 percent contamination with modern (1950) carbon represents a shift of &lt; 14 years in the age. Sample Loading and Degassing After the plasma system was sufficiently cleaned, the sample, with a total mass of 1.06 grams of rock and pigment, was placed with the pigment facing up on a glass platform inside the plasma reaction chamber. Next, the system was again pumped down to high vacuum (- 1 x 10-7 torr) with heat lamps shining on the sample and heating tapes on the walls of the system in order to degas atmospheric carbon dioxide that might have adsorbed onto those surfaces during sample insertion into the chamber. After the sample had thoroughly degassed, we closed the valve to the ion pump and observed the system pressure for several hours (Figure 6). Under normal conditions, the pressure will slowly rise due to the slow outgassing of the walls and minute leaks with time. However, if there is a significant leak to atmosphere in the system, the pressure will rise much more rapidly. Thus we can determine whether or not (or, more accurately, the extent to which) our vacuum system [Vol. 59, No. 4, 1994] 774</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 10-4 ! I ! !

Even if all that gas was carbon dioxide, it would have a negligible effect on the age determination. is leaking. Even after 5 hours without pumping, the pressure had risen to only -.02 millitorr as measured on a Bayard-Alpert ionization gauge. If this were entirely carbon dioxide (again a worst- case scenario), it would correspond to only -.00003 milligrams of carbon-a negligible contribution (&lt; .3/year), even for a sample of only .1 mg of carbon. After the system was determined to have no significant leaks, we ran an argon plasma as a further cleanup step in order to rid the sample of any remaining, strongly adsorbed, atmospheric carbon dioxide. Argon is nonreactive; hence, its plasma would operate as an atomic sandblaster to remove adsorbed carbon dioxide from the system surfaces. The 150-watt argon plasma ran for 1.5 hours and produced only -.4 millitorr of carbon dioxide, or -.0007 mg of carbon. Thus, the system and sample were deemed clean and ready for oxygen-plasma processing of the organic matter in the paint. Oxygen-Plasma Processing To react the charcoal from the sample, we heated the copper oxide furnace to 900?C, which produced pure oxygen. When the oxygen pressure rose to 1.0 torr, the furnace was isolated from the plasma chamber and the RF generator turned on to produce an oxygen plasma in the chamber. Liquid nitrogen was placed on the collection finger. The first oxygen plasma was held at an operating power of 100 watts, our usual operating conditions. The plasma reacts with charcoal relatively rapidly; after 40 minutes most of the charcoal had disappeared. After 60 minutes, we turned off the RF generator, recollected the oxygen onto the copper oxide, and removed the liquid nitrogen to release the carbon dioxide which had formed. Approximately 280 millitorr of carbon dioxide (-.4 milligram of carbon) was produced and sealed into a glass collection tube with a natural gas/oxygen flame. The sample (AAM-la) was sent to the National Science Foundation-University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Laboratory for radiocarbon measurement. During the first oxygen-plasma treatment, the charcoal-painted surface was seen to disappear. Only a white surface, presumably comprised of the intermixed white particles mentioned earlier, remained unreacted on the surface. Figure 7 shows two sample groups, one set unreacted, i.e., in its natural state, and the other set after reaction with the oxygen plasma so that all the charcoal has been reacted away. Much of the white material left on the surface of the reacted sample was calcium oxalate (whewellite). 775</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 42SA1614 ALL AMERICAN MAN .4*X Before Plasma After Plasma 5 cm Figure 7. Pictures of two aliquots of the All American Man samples. The specimens on the left have never been subjected to the plasma treatment. The specimens on the right are the ones that resulted in the two dates reported in this paper and show the change due to oxidation of the charcoal to CO2. We routinely use a second oxygen-plasma treatment after collecting the first carbon-dioxide sample from a given pictograph in the hope of obtaining a backup sample. Though the charcoal had reacted away, the sample was subjected to another oxygen plasma. Previous experience in our laboratory indicates that charcoal reacts faster than other forms of organic material contained in pictograph samples. Thus we assumed that organic material may still have been present. The second plasma- extraction treatment, run under identical conditions as the first, confirmed our assumption and produced approximately 130 millitorr after 180 minutes. The sample (AAM-lb) was sealed and also sent to be radiocarbon dated at the Arizona AMS facility. We then continued with a third oxygen-plasma treatment, but collected only 60 millitorr of carbon dioxide after 4.5 hours. This is marginally enough for a radiocarbon date, but the error would be high, so we simply saved that sample as AAM- 1 c in case of an emergency. Table 1 lists the three oxygen-plasma treatments, their experimental operating conditions, and the amount of carbon dioxide collected. Russ et al. (1992) previously demonstrated that no decomposition of calcium carbonate occurs during our plasma chemical treatment of pictographs painted on limestone (calcium and magnesium carbonate). There were no carbonates observed in the All American Man sample. However, another potential contaminant (through decomposition) is the calcium oxalate mineral whewellite (CaC20x). Table 1.

Carbon dioxide released from reagent calcium oxalate (CaC204) as a function of RF plasma power. Notice that no significant CO2 decomposition occurs until above 250 watts, far above our typical operating power of 100 watts. AMS radiocarbon dates have been obtained directly from whewellite found at rock-art sites in Australia (Watchman 1990). Tests in our laboratory have shown that calcium oxalate does not pose a contamination problem in our procedure because the energy needed to release the carbon dioxide from whewellite is significantly higher than our operation levels of 100 watts as seen in Figure 8. RESULTS Pigment Analysis Two types of white material are present in the All American Man samples. The first type is a relatively thick, white crystalline layer (see Figure 4). X-ray diffraction analysis of this layer showed that it was comprised primarily of bassinite (a dehydrated form of gypsum) and whewellite, a calcium oxalate mineral. The texture of the thick white layer is similar to that of natural accretion layers that we have examined on pictographs in the Lower Pecos River region of Texas. We assume that this thick layer of gypsum and calcium oxalate underlying certain areas of the All American Man pictograph is a natural layer. However, it does not universally underlie all of the charcoal pigment. Gypsum, along with other soluble salts (halite, potash, etc.), is a key mineral in the erosional pattern of the site. Their hydration and dehydration with fluctuations in humidity and temperature exert interstitial pressure during the expansion cycle eventually causing exfoliation. Although calcium oxalate contains carbon, tests in our laboratory show that carbon dioxide is not produced when calcium oxalate is exposed to an oxygen plasma at the power levels used for our extractions. Thus, this natural layer will not cause contamination problems with respect to radiocarbon dating of the All American Man. The second type of white material in our samples of the All American Man is a very fine, white powder intimately mixed with the charcoal. On the flakes of pictograph samples from which all the charcoal has been reacted away, this material appears as a thin layer of white powder on top of the rock surface (and on top of the thicker, natural gypsum and calcium oxalate layer where it occurs). The use of white pigment combined with charcoal in order to achieve a blue color has been observed at other Anasazi sites in the southwest (Hibben 1975; Smith 1952). Describing the various pigments used to paint murals on Kiva walls at the Anasazi material remains of Awatovi and Kawaika-a, Smith (1952:23) reported: Most of the blue pigment was actually a dark gray-blue or battleship-gray, and, in many cases might better be called gray. It seems fairly certain, however, that the painters intended it as blue, as will be discussed later 777</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Table 2.

The great majority of samples tested showed that it was a mixture of carbon with either a white siliceous material or white clay.... One sample, at least, showed under the microscope the unmistakable structure of wood in the black particles present, proving unquestionably that it was an artificial mixture of white clay and charcoal. Thus, it is possible that the fine-grained white material seen in the All American Man pictograph pigment layer was intentionally mixed with the charcoal to form a blue pigment. However, at this point, we cannot ascertain whether this white powder is a cultural product or a natural occurrence. Whatever the source of the white powder, some organic carbon (possibly a binder added to affix the pigment to the rock surface) must have remained after the initial one-hour oxygen-plasma treatment in order to produce the carbon-dioxide samples collected during the second and third oxygen-plasma reaction steps. Since charcoal reacts considerably faster than other paint during oxygen-plasma treatment, it is quite plausible that the charcoal reacted first and that organic binder and/or vehicle remained after all the charcoal had reacted. The fact that the charcoal dated nominally older than the presumed organic binder illustrates a well-known problem with using charcoal for establishing archaeological chronologies (Schiffer 1986). The age of the charcoal is not necessarily the age of the archaeological event to be dated, but is often somewhat older. Dating The radiocarbon age determinations of the two aliquots and their averages are listed in Table 2 along with the calibrated age ranges. The first carbon-dioxide sample from the All American Man pictograph was dominated by charcoal pigment that was seen to react away through the course of the oxygen-plasma extraction. This carbon dioxide sample was radiocarbon dated to 753 ? 57 B.P. (AA-8359), yielding a calibrated age of cal A.D. 1280. The calibrated age with minimum and maximum two-sigma age range is cal A.D. 1160 (1280) 1390 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993, Method B). The second carbon-dioxide sample was taken after the visual disappearance of the charcoal. Thus, the second sample came from the layer composed of white bassinite and whewellite and was radiocarbon dated to 575 ? 68 B.P. (AA-836 1). The calibrated ages (the radiocarbon age intercepts the calibrated age curve three times) with minimum and maximum two-sigma age ranges are cal A.D. 1290 (1335, 1336, 1405) 1440 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993, Method B). We must emphasize that the plasma-chemical technique does not date either bassinite or whewellite. Rather, there must have been some organic material added to the charcoal when the paint was prepared. Our second date was dominated by this implied binder/vehicle. Since the older date was from wood charcoal, it is possible the dates do not overlap at the one- sigma age range due to the "old wood" problem (Schiffer 1986; cf. Geib and Fairley 1992).

The calibrated midpoint of this average is A.D. 1295, with a two-sigma age range of cal A.D. 1260-1400 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993, Method B). CONCLUSION Until further dates are available, we conclude that the weighted average of the two radiocarbon dates on the charcoal pigmented area of the shield (676 ? 46 years B.P., cal A.D. 1260 [1295] 1400), best represents the date that the blue portion of the All American Man was painted. Using the t-test, the two dates we obtained on the All American Man pictograph sample were were indistin- guishable at the 95 percent confidence level. Of course, our two dates on a single sample of the All American Man pictograph, although affirming the antiquity of the "blue" portion we studied, do not preclude that other parts of the pictograph could have been altered in historic times. The red or white pigments could have been added after the initial prehistoric painting of the blue portions. The red or white pigments could be sampled to resolve this question, but given the importance of this site to Park visitors, the management policy of the National Park Service with regard to this particuar pictograph is to remove no sample unless it naturally exfoliates from the alcove. Further dates on the red and white portions of the painting will have to wait until samples become available. The calibrated date of A.D. 1295 on the All American Man is consistent with the archaeological context of a late Anasazi habitation and storage site, therefore the rock art is most easily interpreted as Anasazi. The date is also consistent with a number of late thirteenth- to early fourteenth-century dates from Anasazi sites near the All American Man (Table 3). These dates suggest a new inter- pretation of Geib and Fairley's radiocarbon date on pigment from a pictograph in Ceremonial Cave in south-central Utah. Geib and Fairley (1992) obtained a date of A.D. 1284 (two-sigma age range of A.D. 1250-1400) on charcoal pigment from a homed anthropomorph from Ceremonial Cave, an Anasazi site in the Escalante drainage across the Colorado River from the All American Man. The Escalante area where Ceremonial Cave is located contains evidence of both Fremont and Anasazi occupation prior to A.D. 900, but there is no physical evidence of Fremont occupation after that date except for reputed Fremont rock art. Archaeologists have classified "homed dancers" as Fremont since the 1960s (e.g., Sharrock 1966), but since the Fremont are supposed to have abandoned the Escalante area by at least A.D. 1260, Geib and Fairley (1992) are forced to posit a Fremont abandonment, Anasazi occupation and abandonment, and then a Fremont reoccupation to explain the A.D. 1284 date on their "Fremont" pictograph. However, given a number of late dates from Anasazi sites in the Canyonlands-Glen Canyon region, and given the absence of physical evidence for the Fremont in the Pueblo III period, a more parsimonious explanation of the archaeological evidence is simply that the Anasazi stayed in the area throughout the "Great Drought," and they were responsible for the unusual rock art in 779</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the region. Given perturbation in their natural world caused by drought and downcutting of alluvial resources, and given perturbation in their social world caused by migration of an estimated 30,000 people from the region (Rohn 1989), any anthropologist would predict a rise in these peoples' reliance on the ideological sphere of culture. Direct radiocarbon dates on both the All American Man and the Ceremonial Cave anthropomorph suggest shield figures and homed anthropomorphs were produced by Anasazi people during the waning Anasazi occupation of the canyon country. The real issues regarding dating and affiliation of these two pictographs are untested assumptions about the direction of cultural diffusion or migration. The fac at homed anthropomorphs and shield figures were first defined, given concrete style designation, and attributed to the Fremont of southern Utah does not demonstrate a priori that they in fact originated with the Fremont and spread or diffused outward. As in so many cultural-historical contexts, rock-art researchers give primacy to the first recognition or definition of a trait, even though it may not be its real locus or origin of development. The All American Man and Ceremonial Cave dates require rock-art spe- cialists to reexamine their typology, cultural assignments, and reputed directions of cultural influence. While it is beyond the scope of this paper, we suggest that an equally plausible explanation is that some of the homed anthropomorphs and shield figures in south-central Utah derive from Anasazi influence from the south. The direction of artistic or ideological influence may flow from the Anasazi to the Fremont, rather than the other way around. The beauty of this hypothesis regarding diffusion and distribution of rock-art styles is that dating techniques as the one presented in this paper can be used to test the hypothesis. Acknowledgments.
