<plain_text><page sequence="1">Homiletic Design In The Towneley Abraham Robert B. Bennett Much recent scholarship of the medieval mystery plays has been concerned with the contextual influences and formal principles that shape the great English cycles: their expression in dramatic form of the gothic universe represented by the great medieval cathedrals, their debt to the patristic typological mode of biblical exegesis, their origin as an appropri- ate celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi, their models in literary works like the Cursor Mundi and the Northern Passion, their debt to the oral homiletic tradition of the preaching friars, and so on. We cannot un- derstand the plays' nature or properly evaluate their art without recogniz- ing these influences. The present study, which will be stressing the origi- nality of a particular work in a particular cycle, the Towneley Abraham, seeks to qualify without denying altogether A. C. Cawley's view that "the Towneley cycle, like every other Corpus Christi cycle, is firmly based on the Vulgate and on the patristic interpretation of scriptural history; to- gether these give unity of meaning to the whole cycle."2 Our increased understanding of the general design of the plays provides us reasonable limits, then, within which we may examine the uniqueness of particular cycles and of particular works within cycles and correct occasional ten- dencies of synthesizers, in their efforts to define an aesthetic unity, to elevate traditional form at the expense of individual invention when evaluating the plays. The cycle playwright is continually faced with the obligation to in- vent. For example, the converter of the spare biblical account of the sac- rifice of Isaac must decide, among other things, how old to make Isaac, what kinds of feelings Abraham will express to Isaac and God, what motives, if any, to give God. The whole complex of decisions that make up each version will be different, each play influenced by scripture and patristic teaching but ultimately informed by the vision, bias, and dra- matic craftsmanship of its particular playwright. In this context, David Mills has recently cited the need for more intensive study of particular plays: "An inevitable weakness of studies of the cycle form is that they minimize the individual emphasis given to the same event in different cy- cles. The concentration upon grace in Ludus Conventriae, upon fulfill- ment of divine purpose in Chester, upon human foible in York, and vital sin in Towneley produces very different dramatic and doctrinal effects both within the whole cycle and in the individual plays."3 One might add that expecting all versions of the same play to be aiming at the same doc- trinal ends-an assumption that underlies Rosemary Woolfs dismissal of the Towneley Abraham4-may lead one to condemn a play for failing to achieve an end it never sought. The ethically bent Towneley playwright seems more offended by 5</page><page sequence="2">the idea of the sacrifice than impressed by Abraham's willingness, as scripture records it, to carry out the order without question. The play- wright's sensibilities clash with the event, which, in order to be read as the revelation of perfect faith, requires in Kierkegaard's words, "a teleological suspension of the ethical."5 All of the pageant versions of Abraham's story reflect the tension between faith and ethics to some degree. V. A. Kolve, discussing the presentation of moral goodness in the mystery cycles, uses Abraham and Noah particularly as examples. Goodness, he says, is illus- trated in the cycles by giving a character "an imaginative life larger than doctrine and story strictly require" and is most evident when the charac- ter "serves God, but serves Him critically, not opposing His will, but re- serving the right to voice a human judgment upon it" (p. 153). The result, however, as Mills has noted, of giving Abraham a human sensibility is only to accentuate further the apparent incompatibility between the moral commandment, "Thou shalt not murder," and the spiritual respon- sibility of perfect faith in and obedience to God (p. 56). We still have a God who imposes "a cruel test" out of "arbitrary caprice" (Kolve, pp. 258-59), though this is probably not the image of God that any of the Christian medieval playwrights wanted to convey. Only the Wakefield playwright, however, attempts in any in- tellectually rigorous way to bring God's actions comprehensibly in line with the Christian idea of a loving and just God. To explain God's test of Abraham, he finds it necessary to depart radically from tradition in his characterization of Abraham at the opening of the play; and as a result, he gives a thematic thrust to the scriptural event that is idiosyncratic at the same time that it makes the Towneley play ethically more cohesive than the other versions. If John Gardner is right in believing the Abraham to be by the Wakefield master, then the play's sensitivity to ethical concerns should not be surprising.6 But whoever the author, the unique emphasis of the play is readily apparent when its opening and conclusion are com- pared with those of the other versions. Of the other versions only the Northampton and Brome try in any way to deal with the unsettling image of God in the biblical narrative. The Chester version begins like the scriptural account with God simply com- manding Abraham to sacrifice his son. The York and Ludus Coventriae versions begin by interpolating a prayer by Abraham for his son at the opening, thus emphasizing his love for Isaac and his devotion to God. In his prayer, Abraham thanks God for all of his blessings, especially for Isaac, whom he loves above all. The prayer obviously but efficiently sets the scene for the doctrinal and dramatic concerns inherent in the biblical story. Abraham presents himself in these opening speeches as an exemplum of perfect devotion to God and perfect love for his son. Accord- ingly we are guided from the start in these versions to focus our attention upon the impact of the command on Abraham, and not upon God's mo- tive for issuing it. In neither of these versions does God even appear; in- stead, his will is communicated by an angel. We recognize the command as a means for Abraham to manifest an ultimate measure of devotion, and we recognize its setting up an inner turmoil of grand proportions. The 6</page><page sequence="3">opening, in its functional justification, is not altogether unlike the open- ing of King Lear. We do not question the credibility of the situation; we only recognize it as the necessary initial action for probing the boundary limits of human obedience to God. Abraham's opening declaration of love for Isaac serves not so much to create dramatic tension between his love for Isaac and his faith in God as it serves to demonstrate the awesome power and authority of faith in God that can overrule without question the great but lesser authority in human affairs, love of kind. Love is a foil to faith, not an antagonist, in these versions. Kolve's terms "cruel" and "ca- pricious" are judgmental ones that neither Abraham nor the playwright solicits because in the realm of faith these terms cease to have meaning. The York and Ludus versions are, thus, closest in temper to the Kier- kegaardian response to the biblical tale. Whereas Kierkegaard terms God's command absurd and his own state of mind toward Abraham as- tonishment (pp. 44 and 50), we might think the medieval playwright more comfortable with the terms awe and admiration; but in essence the feel- ings are alike. The Northampton and Brome versions resemble the Ludus and York in having Abraham giving thanks to God and expressing love for Isaac before he is issued the command to sacrifice, but they differ in that they include as well a substantial monologue by God apparently intended in part to explain his motives. In both, the explanations are rather groping and awkward, burdened by the fact that there has been nothing specific that Abraham has done to deserve such a torture. The Brome projects at first a petty tyrant who, hearing Abraham express his great love for Isaac, declares, "I schall asay now hys good wyll, / Whether he lovyth better hys chyld or me" (11. 43-44).7 Philosophically man can understand and accept the notion that love of God is the first and great commandment, but such an anthropomorphic representation of the idea as this in the Brome ver- sion could create the impression of a jealous old man competing against a child for the affection of his favorite. Immediately, though, a motive of a wholly different kind enters when God concludes, "All men schall take exampyll hym be / My commawmentys how they schall fulfyll" (11. 45- 46). No longer petty, God is suddenly the all-knowing teacher who is pro- viding through his servant Abraham, who he knows will respond correctly to the trial, a model for all future generations. Faith in and obedience to God remain absolute and unquestionable tenets, but God's motives in the Abraham episode have been questioned and answered by the Brome playwright. His explanation is identical to that given by the twelfth- century Jewish philosopher Maimonides in The Guide of the Perplexed and is not concerned so much with reconciling the trial to ethical values as with explaining why an all-knowing God would use such a trial to discover the fidelity of Abraham. The answer: he discovers Abraham's fidelity for future humanity, not for himself. According to Maimonides, "The in- terpretation of its [the trial's] dictum-To know whether ye do love-is not: in order that God should know that, for He already knew it; but the meaning resembles that of its dictum-To know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you-the meaning to which is: in order that the religious 7</page><page sequence="4">community should know" (III.24).8 The Northampton version reflects a similar impulse on the part of the playwright to explain God's motives. Sure of Abraham's constancy, God first says he will test him so that the pleasure of Abraham's success will offset the displeasure of Adam's failure. God seems almost embar- rassed and anxious about appearing cruel: "I do not but to assay hym" and he adds that he will reward Abraham for his pains: "Of his sorow I shal delay hym, / And for on childe encrese hym a usunde" (11. 31-34).9 In the play Abraham serves God with no thought of reward, but God's prom- ise here encourages the simplistic notion that worldly reward awaits one who loves God. Although the scriptural account explicitly links God's promise of numberless progeny with Abraham's passing the test, the no- tion that God sends trials on the guiltless in order that he may then in- crease their reward-an idea understandably rejected by Maimonides- creates the impression that God is an ultimately benign tyrant who, how- ever, uses us for his sport. All versions except the Towneley contain the promise of progeny, and the Towneley pageant's ending is unknown since the page(s) containing the last lines of the play are absent from the unique manuscript. The effect of the promise at the end perhaps is not as dissatis- fying as the interpolated speeches by God at the opening of the Brome and Northampton plays precisely because it is a part of the uncritical scriptural narrative, factual rather than explanatory in nature. The prom- ise of progeny calls forth a feeling of awe at the image of Abraham stand- ing on the threshold of Christian history, the father of the race from which God himself will spring. All five of these versions, then, share in repre- senting a spiritually perfect Abraham on whom the test is imposed either without explanation or for reasons that are ethically offensive. The Ches- ter, York, and Ludus plays do not blur the spiritual context with attempts to explain God's motives, but they are by the same token the least ener- getic and inventive. In its attempt to bring ethical coherence to the event, the Towne- ley Abraham takes far bolder steps in critically adapting the source than do the Brome or Northampton versions. The result is a consistent, self- contained play in which typological and historical reminders of the larger context are minimized. What should immediately strike one who reads this play along with the other ones is that Abraham opens the drama with a prayer that contains no thanksgiving and no mention at all of his son Isaac.10 Instead, his prayer is a long planctus in which Abraham tells God that he is world weary, not just because he is old but also because the glories of the world to him seem a thing of the past: When I thynk of oure elders all, And of the mervels that has been, No gladnes in my hart may fall ... (11. 33-35) Accordingly, Abraham feels it is "hie tyme" he received the oil of mercy. He concludes the lament with the fearful recognition that all his patriar- 8</page><page sequence="5">chal forebears are now in hell until "god will here thare mone," and he cries for mercy: Now help, lord Adonai: ffor, certis, I can no better wone, And there is none that better may. This final passage is ambiguous and lends itself to readings of greater or lesser credit to Abraham's spiritual condition at this point. The E.E.T.S. editor, Alfred Pollard, provides the marginal gloss "He can do no better" for "I can no better wone";11 and likewise Munson sees Abraham express- ing "ingenuous satisfaction with his own good intentions" (p. 137). In these readings "can" is an auxiliary verb expressing potential and "wone" is the main verb. The sense of the passage, in context, is that Abraham wishes for the oil of mercy and not for hell, where Adam and "all our eld- ers" have gone, and he thinks that God should aid him because he has lived the best he can and as well as anyone could. If the statement is un- derstood in this way, Abraham appears querulous and moved by fear to unseemly self-praise. He tells God, in effect, that God owes him mercy and will be derelict in goodness if he does not grant it. Another plausible reading, which two colleagues have suggested to me, presents Abraham in a more favorable spiritual light. Taking "can" as the main verb, "to know," and "wone" as the noun "dwelling," this reading sees Abraham conceding that since his ancestors have gone to hell, he expects ("can") no better dwelling for himself without God's help. "And there is none that better may" then means that God is Abraham's surest help. Martial Rose offers still a third possibility in his translation, "For certain no surer help I own, / And there is none that better may."12 Here, "wone," a notably flex- ible Middle English word, is read in its sense of "Hope or expectation of a favourable issue" (OED, sb.3 I.1); and "can," translated by Rose as "own" to approximate the sound of the original verse, is read again as "to know." Whether a definitive reading of these lines is possible I do not know. The first reading most strongly accentuates the sense of a flawed Abraham that I see reflected in the discontent and world-weariness of the soliloquy as a whole. The other two readings present a more temperate figure, aware of his fallibility and beseeching God, with holy fear, to take him mercifully. But the emphasis in all three is still upon Abraham's wish for "the oil of mercy," and it is the impropriety of Abraham's dwelling upon his desire for death, and his blindness to present blessings, to which God's response is a calculated corrective. Abraham's prayer does not go unheeded-"Of mercy haue I herd thi cry," God will tell him presently; but before God addresses Abraham, he declares his motive for testing Abraham in terms that unite obedience with morality: "Wold thay to me be trew, and blyn / Of thare pride and of thare syn" (11. 51-52). In order to explain God's trial of Abraham, the Towneley playwright has, without scriptural precedent, created an Abra- ham in need of moral refinement. The test fits the illness exactly. Because Abraham fails to see the value in life, God confronts him with the imma- 9</page><page sequence="6">nent death of Isaac to generate in him a sensitivity and love for the created things of this world. God simply gives Abraham a command com- parable to what Abraham has requested of God-i.e., to end the life of his son-in order to show Abraham how his sinful world-weariness has blinded him to the glory of God's created world and to his responsibilities within it. The terms of the play then are causal, psychological, ethical, and self-contained. The Towneley Abraham is not an exemplary figure whose actions will manifest a spiritual truth; he is a good but imperfect man whom God educates through the trial. The way in which events foster Abraham's spiritual growth is comparable in interesting ways to King Lear. Lear commences the play with a stated intention to crawl to death, but through his terrible trial he is brought to the point on the heath where, looking at his shivering fool, he can say, "I have ta'en / Too little care of this!" (III.iv.32-33). Abraham, beginning with a death wish, is brought by his trial to the point where he recognizes his responsibilities to human needs, telling God's angel at the end: "To speke with the haue I no space,/ with my dere son till I haue spokyn" (11. 273-74). Of impor- tance here is not just Abraham's new sensitivity for others, but the fact that his attitude is exactly what God meant to achieve by the trial. Kolve notes Abraham's remark as one example of man serving God critically and proving his goodness, which point is true. What we may add to it, though, for this particular case is that God has defined his test of Abraham in ethi- cal terms and, as we shall see presently, approves his servant not for his willingness to slay his son, but for his firmly stated disapproval of the as- signment. Abraham's opening request for the oil of mercy which none hitherto have received leads us reasonably to wonder whether he has been God's obedient servant out of a genuine love of God's goodness or, more limitedly, out of a hope for an eternal reward. If the latter is the case, then Abraham has failed to understand that to love life, which God has given him, is truly to live virtuously. Abraham's reaction to God's visi- tation suggests that he has, indeed, confused flattery and devotion but that he is also a fundamentally sensitive human being receptive to correc- tion. To God's command Abraham, as Pollard's marginal paraphrase indi- cates, "cheerfully promises obedience": Blissyd be that lord in euery land wold viset his seruand thus so soyn, ffayn wold I this thyng ordand, ffor it profettis nought to hoyne. (11. 77-80) Gardner is critical of Pollard's gloss, pointing out that Abraham indicates in the following stanza that he is not happy about the mission: "This com- maundement must I nedis fulfill,/ If that my hert wax hevy as leyde." Pol- lard reasonably suggests, however, by his interpolated stage direction, that Abraham speaks the first passage in God's presence and the second 10</page><page sequence="7">after God has left. The command forces Abraham to question his motives for serving God and to weigh his love of self against his love for Isaac. But although he is troubled, Abraham still manifests a flawed spirit in his willingness to serve God not because God is good but because he is mas- ter: What so he biddis me, good or ill, That shall be done in euery steede; Both wife and child, if he bid spill; I wille not do agans his rede. (11. 85-88) The Towneley playwright, one must believe, does not accept his pro- tagonist's assumption here that God's ways can be evil, although he might see God's ways as sometimes mysterious. Abraham's willingness to do evil for God reflects, in Christian terms, a misunderstanding of God's nature rather than an admirable manifestation of faith. With God immanent in his affairs, Abraham needs no exercise of faith to believe in God's exist- ence; the test of his faith, rather, is to believe that God's intentions are good and just even when from a human perspective they might seem otherwise. On the basis of Abraham's statement, literally interpreted, it is hard not to think that at this point-after God's departure and before his summoning Isaac-Abraham is mastering his revulsion to the task with at best a mindless obedience and at worst a self-serving expectation of re- ward, but not with trust that God's motive, though hidden, is just and worthy of obedience. Once God's command has instilled a moral qualm in Abraham, the responsibility for nurturing this faculty into full strength falls upon Isaac. For his natural remorse at having to slay his son Abraham receives no consolation from Isaac, as he does in the Ludus version. Isaac's opposition to the sacrifice in the Towneley play is more intense and unreconciled than in any of the other versions. Isaac's will to live is coupled with an in- sistence on knowing what he has done to deserve death. As Abraham's natural affection for Isaac is responding to his son's cries for mercy, his reason finds no answer to Isaac's requests to know the justice behind the intended execution. From other-worldly thoughts Abraham is forced by Isaac, who is at once loving, frightened, and morally irreproachable in his life and his protest, to think upon the blessings of this world which his act will destroy. The emotional interchange between father and son takes up fifty-four lines (11. 160-214) and reaches its climax when Isaac, morally unreconciled, resigns himself to his father's will, and Abraham, moved to tears by the encounter, laments, "I were leuer than all wardly wyn,/ That I had fon him onys vnkynde" (11. 217-18), and condemns the task as- signed to him: "To slo hym thus, I thynk grete syn" (1. 221). The com- plaint contrasts in its earnest opposition and moral complication with his earlier facile, "What so he biddis me, good or ill,/ That schall be done in euery steede." Condemnation replaces acceptance, and only a humble sense of his limited knowledge ("I thynk grete syn") allows Abraham to 11</page><page sequence="8">proceed with the sacrifice in a faith, divorced from feeling, that God's purpose is righteous. As the Towneley playwright shapes his action, then, God, knowing the flaw in Abraham's prayer for the oil of mercy, applies a test to restore in him a healthy love for his world; and Abraham passes his test not when he shows his willingness to slay Isaac-because the test is not of faith- but when he complains openly about the sinfulness of the assignment. It is a key point in the play's design, and a notable variant from the other versions, that right after Abraham declares the act a sin and bemoans the fatal impact it will have on Sarah as well (1. 229)-a fact Isaac had pointed out to him-the scene shifts from the father and son to heaven where God, before Abraham has made his final resolution to slay Isaac, com- mands his Angel to prevent him. God declares himself satisfied now with Abraham's state of mind: "I know well how he ment" (1. 240). The Angel's explanation to Abraham of God's approval reinforces the stress on God's motive for acting: "He has persauyd thy mekenes/ And thi good will also, I wis" (11. 265-66). The Angel makes no specific acknowledgment of Abraham's willingness to slay Isaac, and the time of the action suggests that the good intention to which God and the Angel refer is his wish not to kill Isaac and his courage to call the command to do so a sin in his own eyes. By contrast, in each of the other versions Abraham is specifically commended either by God or his emissary Angel for his willingness to slay Isaac. It is well to contrast the Abraham-Isaac relationship in the Towne- ley play with its representation in the others to realize how distinctive it is and how questionable are commentaries which speak of the medieval Ab- raham and Isaac plays as a unified group. The mode of the encounter be- tween Abraham and Isaac in the Towneley play is naturalistic and psycho- logical, and the realism is appropriate because the play focuses upon ethi- cal, social, and moral values, or, in other words, upon man's proper rela- tionship with his fellow man. If the play's first interest were in questions of faith and ultimate meaning, the playwright would have been more likely to stress the metaphorical or poetical qualities of theatrical action over the mimetic. The other Abraham and Isaac versions, which are con- cerned with the obedience of the man of faith rather than with the morality of the sacrifice, are accordingly more formal and ritualistic in their presentation. The Ludus provides the purest example of this mode and the sharpest contrast with the Towneley play. An ascetic purity in the former counterpoints the humanistic vitality in the latter. In the Ludus, faith is seen as the spiritual capacity of man not only to endure but also to find new life and joy in events that otherwise seem life-destroying. The sacrifice of Christ is the life-giving death at the center of Christian com- edy; and its principles have been defined in a brief discussion of comedy by Christopher Fry: Comedy is an escape, not from truth but from despair: a narrow escape into faith. It believes in a universal cause for delight though knowledge of the cause is always twitched away from under us, which leaves us to rest on our own buoyancy.13 12</page><page sequence="9">In the Ludus Abraham and Isaac, we witness the comic escape into faith in Isaac's joyful response when he finally wins from Abraham the reason for their journey to the mountain. Abraham is our emotional vehicle into this play because like us he finds the assignment only painful. Isaac, how- ever, embodies the joy of faith from the instant that he hears that he is to die. Insofar as he dies not by accident, war, or disease, but by command of God he can see his life's end as part of a divine plan: Al-mighty god of his grett mercye Fful hertyly I thanke ]esertayne At goodys byddying here for to dye I obeye me here for to be sclayne I pray 3ou fadyr be glad and fayne trewly to werke goddys wyll take good comforte to 3ow agayne and haue no dowte 3our childe ti kyll. (11. 145-52)14 Isaac's joy is the outstanding piece of dramatic craftsmanship in the Ludus play because it harmonizes doctrine and experience. We are surprised that joy, and not protest, comes from Isaac; but at the same time we realize that while the protest we anticipated would be the natural re- sponse of fallen man, Isaac's is the natural response of spiritual man. The success of this portion of the Ludus Abraham and Isaac points us to the least satisfactory aspect of the Towneley version. If joy is the proper response for Isaac, how do we accept his resistance in the Towne- ley play? The question does seem to be one which the playwright asked himself and resolved by having Abraham never reveal to his son that the sacrifice was commanded by God. In the biblical account, Abraham never expresses himself more specifically on the matter than to say, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering" (King James Ver- sion, Gen. 22.8). There is, in other words, about equal scriptural warrant for and against the playwright's having Abraham tell Isaac the reason be- hind his actions. John Gardner defends the omission in the Towneley on the grounds that it heightens Abraham's dignity. He does not shift the re- sponsibility for his actions to God (p. 241). But one might as easily argue that Abraham's failure to explain his actions only needlessly adds to his son's anguish. There is a more likely, though less appealing, explanation for the playwright's decision here. If he wants us to see Abraham's death wish as wrong and God's test as a means to awaken Abraham to his error, it would only confuse and possibly subvert his morally instructive purpose to give Isaac a legitimate spiritual reason for accepting death joyfully. The Towneley play's interruption of Abraham's final deliberation with the scene of God's commissioning the Angel to prevent the sacrifice importantly affects the drama of the climax just as it affects-as we have seen-the meaning of the play. During Abraham's last stanza of delibera- tion before raising his sword, we watch the Angel "spede ful hastely" to avert the catastrophe. The action takes on temporal and spatial scope, creating a drama of movement, timing, and suspense. The other versions 13</page><page sequence="10">present a different, though not necessarily inferior, dramatic effect when the Angel appears unannounced at the instant Abraham raises his sword. The miraculous intervention does not overtax our "willing suspension of disbelief' because, being familiar with the scriptural account, we would anticipate it. Moveover, the action, if handled with ritual dignity, can in itself be dramatically effective. A dramatic problem does arise, however, in those plays where the human relationship between Isaac and Abraham has been developed and emotional involvement of the audience has been courted. In these instances the deus ex machina resolution creates too ab- rupt a shift from the psychological and realistic to the marvelous. The portion that remains of the Towneley play following the spar- ing of Isaac is consistent with the drama's humanistic emphasis on the need to love God's created world. Whether the missing portion would add further to this idea or not we cannot know. Abraham's hasty thanks and turning away from the Angel in order to speak with Isaac manifests his moving away from his earlier thoughts of the dead to renewed interest in the living. Absent from the play in its present form is God's appearing to Abraham to reward him for his obedience with the promise that his progeny will number like the stars and grains of sand. Such an ending would be wholly fitting for a play whose theme is the affirmation of life on earth, but its absence eliminates the feeling generated in the other ver- sions that God is compensating one of his creatures for cruelties inflicted. The Towneley version leaves us feeling that, for the protagonist, the test was its own reward in its forcing Abraham, the patriarchal source of God's chosen race, to rediscover his desire to live and his commitment to the living. In presenting a theme that is moral, not doctrinal, and characters who are humanly immediate, not spiritually remote, the Towneley ver- sion differs in very fundamental ways from the others. The difference highlights the dangers of treating cycle versions of the same biblical story as if there were a single doctrinal and aesthetic ideal against which all could be measured. Difference, not superiority, is the main claim which I wish to make for the Towneley Abraham. The play's invention is notable in that it does not merely embellish the biblical account but alters it so that the God of Abraham and Isaac can be more comprehensible in Chris- tian terms. Daring invention and generally skillful execution make it an interesting play, but its tidy homiletic design is achieved at considerable cost to the spiritual grandeur of Abraham and Isaac and to the wonder that surrounds the story when faith and obedience are the human faculties we are asked to ponder.

Although his thesis that they all are comic in design is one which I support, his claim that differences between them exist only "in minor details" (p. 45) and his subsequent treatment of them as expressions of a sin- gle medieval mind leads, I think, to serious distortions. For example, he uses the idiosyncratic opening of the Towneley Abraham as his sole example to il- lustrate how the medieval versions as a group fit the agon Prologue in a ritual plot. 3.

Two recent studies that have rightly sought a new appreciation of the Towne- ley Abraham have essentially passed over this startling image of a self- centered Abraham. John Gardner misreads the thrust of the speech when he says that Abraham "speaks of Adam's fall and sorrow, Cain's murder, the triumphs of Noah, now long gone, and, finally, his own great age and fear of death" (pp. 238-39). William Munson in "Typology and the Towneley Isaac," RORD, 11 (1968), more accurately observes Abraham's mood of world- weariness but treats it lightly as "humor in Abraham's characterization" (p. 136) and "humorous discrepancy" (p. 137) with no suggestion of thematic significance. 11.
