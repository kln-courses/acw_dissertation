<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Arctic Voyages of Martin Frobisher: An Elizabethan Adventure. By Robert McGhee. (Seattle and London: University of Washington Press, 2001. Pp. ix, 188. $40.00.) This engaging narrative of Martin Frobisher's three voyages recounts several histories from various points of view. Robert McGhee, a distinguished archaeologist with the Canadian Museum of Civilization, uses his intimate knowledge of ancient arctic peoples to present the tense confrontation between Elizabethan seamen and the Inuit of Baffin Island. Between 1576 and 1578, Frobisher's aims evolved from an attempt to find a Northwest Passage into a quest for gold. A London financier, Michael Lok, assembled a fleet of fifteen ships to bring back tons of the black ore discovered on the earlier voyages, and the final expedition was the largest in Arctic waters until the</page><page sequence="2">1472 The Historian nineteenth century. Although preliminary assays promised rich returns in gold, the rock ended up as building stone. McGhee uses the key mine site on Kodlunarn Island to elucidate the extent of this adventure and explores the documentary thicket of claims and counterclaims to evaluate the extent of fraud. He also explains how the scene of this drama was forgotten by Europeans, but remembered in the oral tradi tion of the Inuit. Finally, Arctic Voyages reviews the archaeology of the Frobisher voyages, from Charles Francis Hall's rediscovery of the Elizabethan mine in 1860 to McGhee's own survey in the early 1990s, and the issues Canada faced when the Smith sonian Institution made a competing offer, which the Canadians, with their smaller budgets, could not refuse. McGhee's anthropological approach permits a sympathetic account of European contact from the native point of view, a clear account of what ordinary Elizabethan workmen endured on these voyages, and a very plausible reading of the complex motives behind these voyages. His synthesis of recent research is compelling, a few peripheral errors apart. He offers interesting hypotheses about the possible European origins of the anthropomorphic stone cairns, which are now Inuit icons; about the conflation of facts in oral tradition; and about the etiology of speculation. He empha sizes the importance of these voyages, concluding that "the political, social, and lin guistic character of northern North America is largely an unintended result of the explorations that began with Martin Frobisher" (186). This might slight the Cabots, father and son, and it surely underestimates the way the Newfoundland fishery facil itated trans-Atlantic communication, but Frobisher's voyages were, certainly, a herald of things to come. This is not an academic monograph, but a clear, accessible, unreferenced summary of voyages made four hundred years ago and of their reverberations since that time, which is suitable for lay readers, students, or professional historians and anthropol ogists looking for a concise account. The bibliography is, perhaps, too brief, but it does highlight the key works on Frobisher, his original Meta Incognita project, and its archaeological successors. Arctic Voyages is a handsome publication; it is nicely laid out and well illustrated with relevant maps, artifacts, and color photographs of the sublime Arctic setting. This is a comfortable volume—not an oversize coffee-table book, but a kind of espresso version of Frobisher's unlikely voyages and of their complex implications.
