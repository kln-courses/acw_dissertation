ABSTRACT Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment under aļ the supervision of T sukuba University Ethics Committee. The c, subjects sat on a seat mounted on a newly developed sled that V( simulated actual car impact acceleration. We selected impact ^ speeds (4, 6 and 8 km/h), seat stiffness, neck muscle tension, aj and alignment of the cervical spine for the parameter study of Q( the head-neck-torso kinematics and cervical spine responses. The effects of those parameters were studies without headrest. ^ The muscle activity was measured with surface ^ electromyography. The cervical vertebrae motion was recorded by cineradiography (90 frames/s X-ray) and analyzed jj to quantify the rotation and translation of cervical vertebrae at impact. Furthermore, the motion patterns of cervical vertebrae in the crash motion and in the normal motion were n( compared. ^ Subject's muscles in the relaxed state did not affect ^ the head-neck-torso kinematics upon rear-end impact. The ramping-up motion of the subject's torso was observed due to eļ the inclination of seatback. An axial compression force ^ occurred when this motion was applied to the cervical spine, aļ which in turn developed the initial flexion, with the lower eļ cervical vertebral segments extended and rotated prior to the ^ motions of the upper segments. Those motions were beyond re the normal physiological cervical motion, which should be fC attributed to the facet joint injury mechanism. Furthermore, ^ the more rigid the seat cushion, the greater was the axial re compression force applied to the cervical spine. On the other j hand, the torso rebounding caused by the softer seat cushion jt tended to intensify the shearing force applied to the upper ^ vertebrae. It was also deduced that the difference in alignment j&lt; of the cervical spine affected the impact responses of head id neck markedly. Also the kyphosis of the cervical spine lused the upper travel of rotation center of the lower cervical ertebral segments and its rotational motion resulting in a igher neck injury incidence. Based on the differences in the lignment of the cervical spine between male and female ccupants, it is also pointed out that the female neck injury icidence tends to become higher than that of male, as the ornale cervical spines take the kyphosis position more often lan the male cervical spines. VTRODUCTION It is believed that the extension of cervical spine would ot exceed the normal physiological motion range, and the yperextension of cervical spine would not occur as long as ìe occupant is using a headrest upon rear impact. It is ¡ported, however, that neck injuries caused by vehicle rear- id collisions are still occurring with high incidence rates, ieck injuries have been on the upward trend in Japan, and utomobile occupants who sustained neck injuries by rear- id impacts increased from 42.7% in 1991 to 44.0% in 1994 Dno and Kanno, 1997). The effectiveness of headrest is ¡ported to be 18% or so in the USA (O'Neill et al., 1972), Highly 14% for the adjustable type headrest and 24% or so &gt;r the fixed type in Sweden (Nygren et al., 1984, 1985). It is ¡ported in a recent investigation conducted by Morris &amp; homas in 1996 that the effectiveness is not statistically clear, is also reported that the incidence of neck injuries is higher &gt;r female occupants than for male occupants (Carlson et al., 285; Lovsund et al., 1988; Muser et al. 1994). According to ich incidence rates of neck injuries, it is pointed out that 3859</page><page sequence="2">headrests including current seat systems do not have sufficient 1 functions and structures for the suppression of neck injuries (LTB van Kampen, 1993). The improper adjustment of relative positions of occupant's head and headrest, difference i in seating position are also pointed out as other factors of j neck injuries (Foret-Bruno et al. ,1991, Olsson et al. 1990). ž The head and torso of an occupant are subjected to ( various kinds of outer forces upon rear impact, which are &lt; rej^ted with the incidence of neck injuries. A number of ( experimental studies on the factors that may affect the neck &lt; injuries using anthropomorphic dummies have been conducted ( so far. According to those studies, Melvin et al. (1972), classified the factors of neck injuries into four main potential kinematics of the car occupant's body, head and neck; namely, 1) head displacement, rotation and acceleration, 2) difference i motions of the head and torso into the deflected seatback, 3) s occupant ramping up the seatback, and 4) occupant rebound. i However, most of experimental studies on neck injury c mechanism conducted in the past were limited to cadaveric experiments done at high impact speeds or those on frontal s collisions, whereas studies on rear-end collisions were quite ( few. It is said that the clarification of correlations among the i neck muscular response, motions of cervical vertebrae, t intervertebral disc and intervertebral articular injury is t necessary for further pursuit of the injury factors including ž those on severer disabilities from neck injuries as well as those s of minor neck injuries. A number of experimental studies &gt; using volunteers (Ono and Kanno 1993; McConnell et al. ( 1993; Szabo et al. 1994; McConnell et al. 1995; Geigel et al, t 1994, 1995; Szabo and Welcher 1996) or anthropomorphic s dummies (Foret-Bruno et al. 1991; Viano 1992) have been also carried out so far, including some reports that analyzed the cervical vertebral motions (Matushita et al. 1994; Yoganandan and Pinter 1997), but none of them has compared such motions with normal physiological motions for the clarification of neck injury mechanism on rear-end impacts. In this regard, we decided to conduct experiments using volunteers to simulate actual car rear-end impacts at low speeds. X-ray cineradiography was used in order to compare ou and analyze the motions of cervical vertebrae upon impact and during physiological conditions, in an attempt to clarify the neck injury mechanism according to the characteristic motions of cervical vertebrae during impact. Furthermore, the effect of volunteers' muscular tension on the head and neck motions; effects of seat cushion characteristics on the head, neck and torso; the differences in head-neck impact t responses due to the difference in alignment of the cervical spine in terms of seating position, and how the differences in ( the alignment of the cervical spine for male and female would i influence the incidence of neck injuries will also be discussed c in this paper. I ( VIETHODS OF EXPERIMENTS Volunteers and Informed Consent - Twelve healthy naie volunteers without history of cervical spine injury participated in this study. Their average age was 24 years, uid it was confirmed through X-rays that they had no iegenerative cervical spine. The study protocol was reviewed md approved by the Tsukuba University Ethics Committee Notice No.28), and all volunteers submitted their informed consent in writing according to the Helsinki Declaration WHO/CIOMS Guidelines 1988). Sled Apparatus for Simulation of Rear End Impact ■ The newly developed sled was designed to overcome such estrictions as limited space for the installation of a sled »ystem, limited field of vision of cineradiography, and the íecessity to transfer the sled system quickly for emergency clinical use of cineradiography. This was installed at the Isukuba University Hospital. The system was capable of diding the sled freely on a 4-meter long rail angled at 10 iegrees and colliding the sled against a damper with a iiaximum speed of 9 km/h. The sled was designed according :o the actual car rear-end impact experiments conducted in he past, and an oil shock damper was installed to simulate iccelerations applied to cars colliding with other cars. A »tandard seat sold in the market or a rigid seat made of wood vas mounted on the sled. A grip handle was installed in front pf such a seat to reproduce the extent of each subject's muscular ension. A schematic diagram and the specifications of the îled system are shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Sled test apparatus and main specifications Cineradiography - The column of radiation probe of he cineradiographic system (cine-system; Angiorex made by Ibshiba Medical Inc.; cine-camera: Arritechno 35, NAC Inc.) can be rotated 180 degrees on a horizontal plane, and the probe tself can be also rotated by ± 180 degrees. The cineradiographic range is 30 cm x 30 cm, and the probe position can be adjusted vertically in the range of 105 to 130 cm as shown in Figure 2.

The cervical spine motion was recorded by cineradiography at 90 frames per second and the dose of exposure was 0.073 mG per frame. Approximately 25 frames were recorded for one crash motion. Sled Acceleration Measurement - The sled acceleration was measured with three-axial accelerometers installed on the sled floor, while the sled impact speed was measured with phototubes. The data processing and analysis of the acceleration measurement as described herein were done in accordance with SAE J21 1 . Head Acceleration Measurement - The subject's motion in this experiments can be assumed as the two- dimensional motion of the X-Z plane, and four-channel accelerometers were used for the measurement of head acceleration, since the six-degree of freedom component measuring method (Ono et al. 1980; Ono and Kanno 1993) was applied. The shear and axial forces and the bending moment acting on the neck upper region (CI) were measured with this method. The fixture shown in Figures 2 and 3 was fabricated for the installation of accelerometers to the subject's head. A tooth form made of a dental resin molded specifically for each subject was set at the lower portion of the fixture while a fastening tape was attached at the upper portion to fix the subject's head at both the upper and lower portions. Head dimensions and locations of accelerometers installed on each subject were determined by means of a dimensional measurement using X-ray films as shown in Figure 3. Location of Head C.G. - The location of anatomic center of gravity of the head was assumed by the determination methods which are reported by Walker et al. (1973) and Beier et al. (1980). The position of the head C.G. was located 5 mm in front of the external auditory meatus and 20 mm above the Frankfurt line which connects the lower orbital margin and the center of auditory meatus. Chest Acceleration Measurement - Tri-axial accelerometers were installed on the front chest around the sternum region. The accelerometers were adhered onto an aluminum plate attached to the front chest with rubber bands. Electromyography - In contrast to experiments using cadavers, in experiments using volunteers, the muscular responses tend to vary due to the mental states of the subjects. As this effect cannot be ignored, we have conducted experiments under two conditions of muscle tension - when they were relaxed, and when they intentionally became tense - in order to find out how the muscle tension affects their head and neck motions. Muscle activities was measured by means of surface electromyogram compared with the cineradiography. EMG electrodes were attached onto the skin over sternoclaidomastoid muscles, paravertebral muscles and trapezius muscles on the subject's left side, and sternoclaidomastoid muscles on the right side. The electrodes with diameter of 5 mm were arranged as bi-polar electrodes with a distance of roughly 2 cm between the electrode centers. The EMG signal was sampled at 5000 Hz and then recorded on OVDAS (On Vehicle Data Acquisition System) data 3861</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4. Lateral view of the head/neck/torso with mounted accelerometers, EMG electrodes, targets for high- speed video acquisition system. Processing of the EMG signal was done with MATLAB 5 program (Math Works, 1996). In order to remove artifacts, the EMG signal was high-pass and low-pass filtered at frequencies of 8 Hz and 450 Hz, respectively. These frequencies were selected from values recommended by Basmajian and De Luca, (1985). Visual Motion Analysis of Head-Neck-Torso Kinematics and Cervical Vertebrae - For the analysis of subject's motions upon impact, target marks were adhered over the head accelerometers, Thl accelerometer and chest accelerometer, near the position of 5 mm below the auditory meatus around the center of gravity of the subject's head, over the surfaces of each shoulder (acromion of scapula), the 12th rib (on the lateral side), the iliac crest and the upper sternum (Figure 4). For the analysis of relative motions of the head, neck and torso, small lead balls of about 3 mm diameter were used as the reference points for the determination of the head- neck joint and the neck-torso joint in X-ray photographs (Figure 3). They were adhered between individual target marks and the surfaces of auditory meatus, Thl and the upper sternum. Target marks were also adhered to the upper and lower portions of seatback side, and photographs were taken with high-speed video cameras (made by MEMORECAMNAC Inc.) at the speed of 500 frames per second. The photographed images were incorporated in &lt; ImageExpress (NAC Inc.) and analyzed. Definitions of Head, Neck and Torso Angles, Head- Neck and Neck-Torso Joints - The head-neck joint is defined &lt; as the intersection point of the extended line from the posterior tangent of cervical vertebra C2 and the skull base tangent parallel to the Frankfurt line on the head. The neck-torso joint is defined as the intersection point of the extended line of the curve formed by the posterior of vertebra and the line connecting the small lead balls on the surfaces of Thl and the upper sternum. This point is located around the upper end of Thl . The head-neck link is defined as the line connecting the head- neck joint and the neck-torso joint, while the inclination of the line is defined as the neck rotational angle (Figures 3 and 4). The rotational angle of upper torso portion is defined as the torso rotational angle formed with the inclination of the line connecting Thl and the upper sternum. The head rotational angle is defined as the inclination of the line passing through the location of head C.G. parallel to the Frankfurt line. Cervical Vertebral Motion Analysis - The cervical vertebral images taken by cine-cameras were digitized and analyzed. Although it is desirable to analyze the cervical vertebral motions over the entire range of CI to Thl in reference to the first thoracic spine, the analysis was done mainly in the range of C2 to C6 due to the limited cineradiographic field of vision. Templates suitable for the shapes of individual cervical vertebrae were produced as shown in Figure 5. This was done to fit them precisely over the individual cervical vertebrae and the spinous process which should move sequentially with time. Based on these, the system of coordinates of the inferior anterior and posterior points were determined accordingly. From those coordinate values, the angles from the horizontal plane and the vertical translations of individual vertebral segmental bodies were calculated. It was decided to represent the vertical translation by taking the midpoint between the inferior anterior and posterior points of each vertebral body. The motions of the entire cervical vertebrae were represented by the changes in the relative rotational angle and translation of each cervical vertebra from the sixth cervical vertebra. The direction of cervical spine extension was decided as the positive rotational direction, and the upward motion was designated as the positive vertical distance. There were some cases in which analyzable images could not be obtained from the impact experiments due to the limited cineradiographic field of vision. In such cases, the obtainable images were deemed as the initial values. Experiment Matrix - Four series of experiments were conducted on 12 volunteers under different conditions without headrest in every series. Due to the overlapping of the same subjects used in different experimental series, the total number of subjects shown in the tables is not 12. The series- 1 experiments used ten subjects to find the variation of motions among individual subjects under the same impact conditions 3862</page><page sequence="5">Figure 5.

Three subjects 'ere used in the series-2 experiments (Table 2) to clarify the ifferences in level of muscular tension on the subjects' lotions at an impact speed of 6 km/h . One subject was used i the series-3 experiments (Table 3) to verify the differences i initial relative positions of head and neck alignment on the object's motions at the impact speed of 6 km/h. Three subjects 'ere used in the series-4 experiments (Table 4) to find the ifferences in seatback characteristics (standard or rigid) on íe subjects' motions.

Namely, the first experiment 'as conducted to record the cervical vertebral motions by leans of cineradiography, while the second experiment was one to record high-speed video visual motions. RESULTS Subject's Motions and Responses of Head, Neck and 'orso - The impact phenomenon as the typical case at speed km/h, with rigid seat, and without head restraint can be escribed by the following: 1 ) the motions observed by high peed video, 2) acceleration at each region of subject, moment, Drees on the neck and motions of the head, neck and torso, 3) ervical vertebral motions observed by cineradiography, and 3863</page><page sequence="6">pfi a 2 W) #o h3 G u V G #S G U K pfi G #o O S QJ G U pfi QJ -N-* Un 4¿ 2 U V u a&gt; o fi CS o a&gt; 2 « a&gt; a&gt; a CA W) 2 a s o « o S o 2 0 1 p^ o a&gt; fi X5 S s • so a&gt; Un S DD fa 3864</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7.

The mean value f deviation was 0.24 mm. Phase I (0-50 ms. Initial Response Phasei - 1 ) The ubjecťs back starts to be pushed against the seatback. 2) ibout 25 ms after impact, the head and Thl start to accelerate round the same time with the head slightly faster than Thl robably by initial flexion of the cervical vertebrae due to the pward-backward rotaion motion of the torso. The sled cceleration reaches maximum around 45 ms. 3) No ignificant motion of head or neck is found in this phase, iowever, the straightening of the spine is observed and the 3w level of the neck bending moment is also observed in lexion phase. 4) Neck muscular response is not found. 3865</page><page sequence="8">Figure 8. Motion of neck-torso joint (Rigid Seat) Phase II (50-100 ms. Principal Neck Axial Force a Motion. Flexion Phase) - 1 ) The subject's upper torso is pushed s against the seatback and the extension of spine reaches t maximum. The head is moving backward in parallel to the torso due to its inertia. The spine extension results in the arching of the torso. The neck which is the link between the ï head and the torso starts showing an S-shape formation. 2) h The ramping-up motion and the backward rotation of torso s continue. The neck rotation as the head-neck link becomes a faster and greater than the head rotation. The axial t compression force applied to the cervical spine shows the i maximum value around 50 ms due to the torso ramping-up s motion, and the shear force starts increasing gradually. The b Thl acceleration shows the maximum value around 60 ms, r while the neck moment in extension shows the maximum r value around 100 ms and starts showing a plateau. 3) A lower cervical vertebra (C6) reaches the phase of initial flexion. The rotation of upper cervical vertebrae (C3, C4 and C5) starts p later on. 4) In relation with these neck link motions, the f discharge of sternoclaidomastoid muscles starts around 70 ms. a a Phase III (100-150 ms. Principal Neck Shear Force g Motion. Flexion-Extension Phase) - 1) The torso is going to b be pushed against the seatback, and the arched rotation of the C upper torso shows the maximum value around 130 ms, and r the principal extension rotation of the head starts. The g ramping-up of torso becomes maximum around 150 ms and c it can be observed to coincide with a significant extension of c the spine. 2) Acceleration of the head becomes maximum e around 130 ms. The neck-torso joint motion is characterized n by the ramping-up-and-down motion of torso around that time. v The head rotational angle starts becoming larger than that of b the neck, and the shear force of neck becomes maximum. 3) About 100 ms after impact, the sixth cervical vertebral extension angle becomes maximum, and the upward translation also becomes maximum. The upper cervical ii vertebrae follow the extension of C6, and the extension of 4 Figure 9. Motion of neck-torso joint (Standard Seat) iligned cervical vertebrae starts. 4) The discharge of ternoclaidomastoid muscles, paravertebral muscles and rapezius muscles continues. Phase IV (150 ms. Final Response Phase: Maximum Extension Phase) - 1) The rotational extension angles of the lead and neck become maximum around 250 ms, then they tart resuming the original positions thereafter. 2) Head icceleration remains roughly constant after 150 ms, but the orso ramping-up motion continues. This ramping-up motion nfluences the Thl acceleration, neck bending moment, and hear and axial compression forces, but this effect gradually lecomes smaller. 3) Individual vertebra rotates while naintaining roughly the same extension alignment. 4) The nuscular discharge of the neck disappears around 250 ms. Experiments with Standard Seat - Characteristic ►henomena of the experiments with the standard seat differ rom the phenomena which was described above. The iccelerations, head, neck and torso angles and neck forces re shown in Figure 7 b). However, the subject's teeth force gripping the fixture of accelerometers slackened in the time ►etween 1 30 ms and 1 80 ms, which was found as an artifact. Compared with the experiments using the rigid seat, the torso notions in general and the rebound motion in particular are greater. The head rotational angle is smaller, and the axial ompression force is also smaller but the timing for the axial ompression force to reach the maximum value is later in the xperiments using the rigid seat. The timing to reach the naximum value of shear force is also later than in the case vith the rigid seat, but the maximum value itself tends to ►ecome larger. Motions and Muscular Responses of Head and Neck For experiments with neck muscles (Table 2) relaxed before mpact, the maximum head extension angle was in a range of 0-56 degrees (Figure 10a. and 10b.). The average value of 3866</page><page sequence="9">Figure 10a. Head extension angle-time histories 3 2 _ Mi iscles reli xed befoi e impact 0 2 _ M lisci es ter sed befor &gt; impact -3 t 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 time tins; ņire 10b. Typical example of Sternoclaidmastoid Muscles EMG-time histories the maximum head angle was about 50 degrees, and standard deviation was 7 degrees. When the subjects tensed their S muscles before impact, the maximum angle ranged from 25 a to 40 degrees . Thus, pre-impact tension of the neck flexors a decreased the maximum angle of the head extension by about s&lt; 30-40%. Furthermore, when the subjects activated their v muscles before impact, the head and the neck began to rotate r&lt; sooner than for the relaxed muscles. Two explanations for tl this phenomenon are possible. The first is that the pre-impact n muscle tension increased stiffness of joints connecting the a torso and the head-neck complex. Accordingly, "coupling" ri between the head and the torso motion increased. The second n explanation is that pre-tension of the extensor muscles could f&lt; tend to pull the head back sooner. Electromyographic activity b of the paravertebral neck extensor and trapezius muscles was e low even when the subjects were asked to do tensed runs. For b this reason electromyographic responses are analysed only tl for the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure 10b and Figure 1 1). The start time of the sternoclaidomastoid discharge was in a a range of 76-93 ms. The average start time was 79 ms, and a standard deviation was 9 ms. Thus, muscle activity started fi not sooner than about 100-180 ms before the head extension o angle reached its maximum (Figure 11). si Figure 11. Example of head angle and SCM-time histories ^ from neck muscles relaxed before impact if Effect of Difference in Alignment of the Cervical pine - Differences in seating posture, seatback inclination nd positions of head-neck are factors that affect the load pplied to the cervical spine. The seatback inclination was et at the standard sitting position in this study, while the neck ^as set at the lordosis, neutral and kyphosis positions, espectively to find out how the difference in alignment of le cervical spine would affect the loads applied to the head- eck kinematics (Table 3). As for the cervical spine lignment, the position of the neck where the head becomes Dughly vertical as shown in Figure 12 was deemed as the eutral position, the position by which the head inclines Drward by 30 degrees as the flexion position, and the position y which the head inclines backward by 40 degrees as the xtension position. It is found that the cervical alignment ecomes kyphosis at the flexion position, roughly linear at le neutral position, and lordosis at the extension position. Figure 1 3 shows the head, neck and torso rotational ngles caused by the different cervical alignment. These ngles are derived from the individual anatomical reference rames. The initial position is adjusted to be 0 degree based n the individual anatomical reference frames. Figure 14 iiows relative angles of head-neck rotations, while Figure 15 hows the time-histories of rotational angles of individual ervical vertebral segments at different positions of cervical lignment. The rotational angles of the head and C2 are similar nplying that there is no relative rotational motion between îe head and C2. Figure 16 shows the time-histories of ending moment, axial compression force and shear force pplied to the upper neck in different states of cervical lignment. It should be noted that the computed neck loads hown in Figure 16 include the effect of unknown muscles )rces and therefore not net loads. It is found from Figure 14 lat the head rotational angle becomes approximately 80 egrees at the flexion position, while it becomes approximately 8 degrees at the extension position, indicating that the head National angle becomes larger as the head-neck forward îclination angle becomes larger. 3867</page><page sequence="10">Figure 12.

Crash extension motion - Pattern of rotational angle of each vertebra (from the horizontal plane) Figure 18. Normal extension motion - Pattern of rotational angle of each vertebra (from the horizontal plane) On the other hand, no remarkable differences are found a in rotational angles of neck and torso by the difference in a cervical alignment. In terms of change in head-neck relative angle, however, the variation of relative angle becomes smaller f as the initial position changes from flexion to neutral then to ř extension. In other words, non-alignment of relative motions p of head and neck (S-shape formation) becomes greater in the state of flexion, whereas the head rotates in link with the rotation of cervical spine in the state of extension, resulting c in smaller loads to be applied to the intervertebral joints and t intervertebral discs. Such phenomena can be explained well c by the change in rotational angle of each cervical vertebral Y segment shown by cineradiography in Figure 15. The relative c displacement between the head and neck is shown by the c variation in the extent of difference in intervertebral rotational s angle. By observing such phenomena in terms of variations e in bending moment, axial compression and shear forces ř applied to the cervical spine, the findings may be summarized as follows: I 1) Bending moment : In the state of flexion or neutral, a negative moment acts on the cervical spine around 50 ms, but it changes into a positive moment around 80 ms or so. In r the state of extension, on the other hand, the moment is in t positive direction from beginning. It indicates that the cervical t vertebral motion changes from the state of flexion to extension r for both lordosis and neutral alignments, while the cervical 3 vertebral motion stays in the state of extension from the t beginning in case of kyphosis alignment. a 2) Axial compression force: The force reaches r maximum roughly at the same time for flexion, extension and e neutral. The value itself is the greatest in the state of flexion, and it becomes smaller as the state changes into neutral then v to extension in that order. This indicates that the torso r ramping-up motion causes more stress in the state of flexion f is in the typical S-shape formation, resulting in the greatest ixial compression force. 3) Shear force: The shear force onset time is the earliest or extension, followed by neutral and flexion in that order, heedless to say, it reflects the difference in the timing of torso &gt;ushed against the seatback. Symptoms on Subjects After the Experiments - A Tinical doctor had personal interviews with the subjects at he time of MRI prior to the experiment, on the experiment lay, one day, one week, and one month after experiment, and landed out questionnaires to the subjects. Presence/absence &gt;f any subjective symptoms and details of such symptoms in laily life, if any, were recorded accordingly. Although one ubject out of 12 recognized neck discomfort next day of experiment, the discomfort disappeared within a few days, ^o other symptom was recognized thereafter. )ISCUSSION Muscle Effects - The current results indicate that only nuscles activated before impacts can influence kinematics of he head-neck complex in rear-end impacts at low speeds. In he present study pre-impact activity of the neck muscles educed the maximum angle of the head extension by about 10-40%. Significant decrease of the head angle due to muscle ension in rear-end impacts has been also reported by Mertz ind Patrick (1968; 1971). However, they did not monitor nuscle activity. Thus, exact information about the muscle îffect cannot be obtained from their study. The average start time of the neck flexors discharge vas measured here to be 79 ms. Since there is about 70-100 ns delay between the EMG onset and the time when muscle orce can reach its maximum (Tennyson and King, 1976; 3870</page><page sequence="13">3871 Figure 19. Pattern of cervical injury mechanism based on each vertebra motion during rear-end impacts Axial compression force e cervical spine shows flexion in the Phase 1 and S-shape formation in the Phase II. At this phase, the &gt;tion segment at the apex of convex curvature (C5-C6) suffers from the stress of intervertebral articulations Herzog, 1994), and the head angle reached its maximum at 200-250 ms after the start of an impact, we conclude that ( muscle effect on kinematics of the head-neck complex was r insignificant when the neck muscles were relaxed before h impact. ii The start time of muscle discharge measured in the f present study agrees well with values reported by Foust et al., n (1973) who found that the average start time for neck flexors 1 is 56-92 ms. On the other hand, the current values for the a start time of the muscle discharge are about 20-40% lower n than the results of Szabo and Welcher (1996). They reported I values of 100-130 ms for discharge of sternoclaidomastoid. 1 One explanation of this difference can be that in our study a s steady training was performed in order to teach the subjects fc to keep their muscles in relaxed state prior to impacts. Since tl this state changed individual reaction patterns of the subjects, 1 it could also affect the muscle discharge start time. ' In the current study the muscle effect on the head angle p only was analyzed. However, for understanding of a possible h muscle effect on the injury mechanisms in rear-end impacts, L in-depth knowledge about muscle influence on neck tl kinematics is needed. Therefore we propose to investigate r the effects of muscle tension on movements of cervical ( vertebrae during impacts for further study. r i n Cervical Injury Mechanism Deduced From the Cervical Vertebral Motions - A subject's torso shows the amping-up motion by the inclined seatback during rear-end mpact. As the head remains in its original position due to nertia in the initial phase of impact, an axial compression orce is apt to be applied to the cervical spine which in turn noves upward and the flexion occurs at about same time, "he lower vertebral segments (C6, C5 and C4) are extended ind rotated earlier than the upper vertebral segments. Those notions are beyond the normal physiological range of motion, t is found by comparing the motions during crash (Figure 7) with the normal extension motions (Figure 1 8) of the same ubject that the rotational angle pattern in crash is reversed &gt;y the pattern in the normal state around 100 ms. The lower be vertebral segment, the larger the rotational angle becomes, "hat is, the rotational angle between the fifth and sixth ertebral segments is the largest of all. This is an non- ihysiological motion of the vertebral segments. On the other tand, Bogduk and Marsland (1988), April and Bogduk (1992), .ord et al. (1993) reported that the cervical facet joints are he most common sources of chronic cervical pain which is elated to the lower cervical vertebrae. Kaneoka and Ono 1997) hypothesized that such non-physiological motions in ear impact were attributed to the mechanism of facet joint njury (zygapophyseal joint injury). A pattern of the nechanism is shown in Figure 19, based on the cervical</page><page sequence="14">Figure 20. Normal extension of C5/6. Figure 21. Crash extension of C5/6. vertebral motion in rear impact. This pattern of the cervical spine motions represents the so-called "whiplash motions of cervical spine" with the S-shape formation of cervical vertebrae. It can be deduced easily that such whiplash motions are caused by an improper setting of the clearance between the headrest and the head. This bi-phasic curvature is also found in the simulated whiplash experiments using cadavers (Panjabi, 1996; Yoganandan et al., 1996). According to a recent study done by Yang et al. (1997), the stiffness of intervertebral articulations is reduced to half when a compression force is applied. As for the intervertebral articular mobility, it can be pointed out that the rotational angle becomes larger for lower cervical vertebrae than for upper ones, which makes the lower cervical vertebrae easier to move than others. Hence, it can be said that the motions of vertebral segments in impact are beyond the normal physiological movable range, and the cervical vertebrae can move more easily when a bending moment and a compression force are applied between C5/C6 segments and the I. A.R. (instantaneous axis of rotation) of the segment C5 is moved upward (Figures 20 and 21). Such loads at low speeds in particular would tend to concentrate on the lower vertebral segments. It can be hypothesized that such non-physiological motions of vertebral segments increase stress of the intervertebral articulations and stretch of the anterior longitudinal ligaments. Based on this hypothesis, it can be deduced that facet joint injury or intervertebral disc injury may be caused by the motions if the impact speed is increased enough or the subject is disadvantaged due to degenerative changes in the spine. Effect of Seat Stiffness on Head-Neck-Torso Kinematics and Cervical Vertebral Motions - Injuries caused by the hyperextension or hyperflexion of cervical spine in particular have been evaluated by two parameters - neck bending moment and head rotational angle. It is found, however, that the axial compression of cervical spine plays an important role, as well as the extension of cervical spine, in the determination of the amount of impact applied to the neck as already described. The trajectories in Figures 22 and 23 show comparisons Figure 22. Head/neck/torso trajectories for Rigid Seat Figure 23. Head/neck/torsô trajectories for Standard Seat 3872</page><page sequence="15">of subjects' motions at the impact speed of 8 km/h for the i standard and rigid seats. Great differences in subjects' motions are found. Namely, the comparison of torso ramping-up motion by the trajectories of the target marks adhered to the 1 upper sternum indicates that a sharp ramping-up motion starts f with the rigid seat in the early phase of impact, while a sharp c ramping-up motion and rebound are found around 100 ms c with the standard seat, though no significant difference is c found in the upward displacement (it is approximately 50 mm i for both of them). Looking back at the trajectories for the i neck-torso joint over time (Figures 8 and 9), it is found that I the ramping-up motion is sharper with the rigid seat, which s agrees with the phenomenon mentioned above. The rebound c of standard seat caused the sharp rotation of head around 150 s ms (Figure 23). I The interpretation of these variations in terms of neck s moment, shear and axial compression forces reveals that the ' axial compression force applied to the cervical spine is approximately 150 N with the rigid seat around 100 ms in the i early phase of impact, which is about twice greater than that c of the standard seat (Figure 7 a)). The shear force, on the ' other hand, is 241 N with the standard seat around 1 10 ms i when the rebound of torso has occurred, which is roughly 1 .6 1 times greater than the value of 152 N with the rigid seat (Figure 7 b)). c Based on the first stage of experiments done by c Kaneoka and Ono (1997), the effect of the compression force ' on the cervical spine in the early phase of impact was z compared in terms of the rotation of C3 against C6 at 100 ms i after impact for speeds of 4 and 6 km/h, respectively, and the s variations of motions at anterior and posterior points. It can 1 be pointed out that the motions at both anterior and posterior 1 points were greater with the rigid seat than the standard seat, ( and the compression of cervical spine was also greater with z the rigid seat. t The stiffness of seat is an important parameter for the r optimum design of occupant restraint system aiming at the enhancement of performance. Parkin et al. (1995) pointed ( out that the incidence of minor neck injuries would tend to ' increase if the seat stiffness was increased. Svennson et al. i (1993) pointed out that the elastic rebound caused by the 1 seatback would facilitate the incidence of whiplash injury. s From the current study, it may be said that the s difference in seat stiffness affects the torso motions upon impact, which in turn markedly affects the load to be applied ( to each cervical vertebral segment. If the stiffness is increased, the torso ramping-up motion in the initial phase of impact in particular will become sharper, and the axial compression z force on the cervical spine tends to become greater. Even if i the stiffness is low, however, the head-neck link will be i displaced if the rebound is great particularly in the latter half &lt; of impact. It is presumed that this phenomenon causes an i ntense shear force against the upper cervical spine. Different Alignments of the Cervical Spine and Incidence of Neck Injuries - As has been described in the bregoing, the difference in initial head-neck position - i.e., iifference in position of alignment of cervical spine as the lifference in seating position - greatly affects the motions of :ervical vertebrae and loads applied to them. In this study, a igid seat has been used, but the torso ramping-up motion and ebounding are apt to change if a different type of seat is used, t is also presumed that the effect of alignment of the cervical ;pine is equivalent to or higher than the effect of seat characteristics in some cases. In this regard, more attention »hould be paid to the cervical spine alignment than any other jarameter affecting the occupant's seating position such as »eat stiffness and seatback inclination angle, when considering &gt;arameters for the evaluation of neck injuries. It has been also reported that the incidence of neck njuries was higher for female occupants than for male jccupants, and the difference in seatback characteristics was jointed out as the probable cause of the difference in neck njury incidence (Carlson et al., 1985; Lovsund et al., 1988; Ví user et al. 1994). However, Matsumoto et al. (1997) in a recent study íonducted on the relationship between cervical curvature and lis degenerations using 495 subjects reported that lordosis josition accounts for 35% or so as the cause of such injuries imong female occupants younger than 40, while kyphosis ncluding linear position accounts for 65% or so. He also ;howed that the percentage of kyphosis position is much higher br female than male. In the case of male occupants the ordosis position accounts for 75% or so. Based on our experimental study, it can be pointed out that the rotational ingle of the cervical vertebrae becomes obviously larger at he kyphosis position. This may explain the higher minor ìeck injury incidence for occupants with the kyphosis position. Under such circumstances, it will be difficult to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of headrest or seatback ìnless investigations and analysis are conducted in proper nanner so that not only the relative positions of headrest and lead but also the seating position - alignment of the cervical »pine in particular - can be estimated, as suggested in this »tudy. CONCLUSIONS A new low speed impact test setup was developed, ind the compact, light sled was fabricated, and experiments vere conducted by means of X-ray cineradiography and EMG neasurements, using twelve volunteers. As a result, the effect )f tension/relaxation of volunteers' muscles on their head and ìeck motions was verified. Motions of cervical vertebrae 3873</page><page sequence="16">during impact and those in physiological conditions were also compared, and the facet joint injury mechanism was deduced from the characteristic motions of cervical vertebrae, as the mechanism of occurrence of neck injuries. Based on this mechanism, the effect of seat cushion characteristics on the impact responses of head, neck and torso, the relationship between the alignment of the cervical spine with the seating position and neck injuries, and the effect of correlation between the alignment of the cervical spine and male/female difference on the incidence of neck injuries have been clarified as described below: 1) It was found from the current study that the effect of the difference in muscle tension did not affect the head-neck- torso kinematics, since volunteers were relaxed as they became familiar with the atmosphere of the experiments. However, it was also found that the head backward rotational angle could be reduced by 30 to 40 % when the subject made the cervical muscles tensed. It will be, therefore, necessary to determine how the muscle tension/ relaxation affects the neck injury mechanism. 2) Subject's torso exhibits a ramping-up motion due to the inclination of seatback. Hence an axial compression force is applied to the cervical spine, resulting in the initial flexion. The lower cervical vertebral segments (C6, C5 and C4) are extended and rotated prior to the upper cervical vertebral segments. These are non-physiological motions of individual cervical vertebral segments, which are beyond the physiological motion range. When a bending moment is applied to C5/C6, it becomes easier for C5/C6 to rotate with the rotational center of C5 moved upward. This motion was hypothesized as "Facet Joint Injury Mechanism". Owing to this hypothesis, the tendency of concentration of loads on the cervical spine in low speed rear-end impact can be explained easily. It is deduced that this is a cause of intervertebral articular injury. 3) Difference in seat cushion stiffness affects the torso motion upon impact, which influences loads applied to the cervical vertebrae. The higher the seat cushion stiffness, the more significant the torso ramping-up motion becomes and the greater the axial compression force applied to the cervical spine becomes. On the other hand, the lower the seat cushion stiffness, the greater the torso rebound becomes, resulting in non-alignment of head and neck in the latter half of impact which would cause a great shear force against the upper cervical spine. 4) It is found that the initial state of neck position (difference in cervical alignment position) markedly affects the impact responses of head and neck. Namely, in the state of flexion (kyphosis), the lower cervical vertebral segments are affected by the effect of torso ramping-up motion, resulting in a greater difference in relative motions (S-shape formation). Considering this phenomenon and the facet joint injury mechanism, it can be deduced that the upward travel of the rotation center and the amount of rotation of C5 vertebral segment increased in the state of flexion . This facilitates the incidence of neck injury. 5) It is hypothesized that facet joint contact occurs easily in the state of flexion for the kyphosis position. This may expalin the higher incidence rate of neck injuries for occupants with the kyphosis position. 6) It is suggested that not only the relative positions of the headrest and head but also the alignment of the cervical spine (seating posture) can be estimated for the evaluation of the effectiveness of headrest or seatback. 7) It is also concluded that carefully reviews will be needed for the knowledge and understanding of the-state-of-art on the incidence of minor neck injuries based on accident investigation and analysis.
