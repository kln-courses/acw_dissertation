<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS Dr. Thorne Deuel has been called to active service with the armed forces and has tendered his resignation from the office of Secretary-Treasurer of the Society. Acting un- der the powers granted in Article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution, the Executive Com- mittee has appointed Waldo R. Wedel, Secretary, and Frederick Johnson, Treasurer. This news was received too late for inclusion in the last number although these changes were noted in the list of officers. Ales Hrdlicka retired on March 31, 1942, from the position of Curator, Division of Physical Anthropology, U. S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, after thirty-eight years and eleven months of active service. Henceforth his title will be Associate in Anthropology. T. D. Stewart, who has been associated with this division since 1924, has been promoted to the curatorship and is now the administrative head of the division. Dr. Hrdlicka has arranged also to give up his editorship of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology at the end of the current volume year. He founded the Journal and has edited it continuously since 1918. Dr. Stewart, the present assistant editor, will serve as the new editor for a period of six years. The American Association of Physical Anthropologists will elect succeeding editors, and each year after 1943 will replace one of the four associate editors. Although retiring from his two most important activities in the field of physical anthropology, Dr. Hrdlicka will continue to occupy his old office in the Museum and will carry on his scientific research as well as serve in an advisory capacity. Dr. Hrdlicka's past contributions to anthropology were enumerated, along with his bibliography, in a special volume of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology (Volume 26, 1940) honoring his seventieth birthday. This volume also gives details regarding the celebration of this event by the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. Dr. Daniel F. Rubin de la Borbolla, Director, announces that the former Depart- ment of Anthropology of the Instituto Polit&amp;cnico Nacional has now become the Escuela Nacional de Antropologfa, forming a part of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa e Historia. With the cooperation of the Universidad Nacional de Mexico, professional training is offered in General Physical Anthropology, Archaeology, Ethnology, and Lin- guistics. The address of the institution is Escuela Nacional de Antropologia, Moneda 13, Mexico, D. F. The Instituto Indigenista Interamericano announces that the Boletin Indigenista will appear six times a year during the months when America Indigena, the quarterly magazine, is not in press. Subscriptions to both journals are included in the single fee of $2.00. Interested persons may secure subscription blanks through the Editor's office, or may address Sr. Don Carlos Giron Cerna, Secretary and Director of Publications, In- stituto Indigenista Interamericano, Orrosco y Berra 1-304, Mexico, D. F. Interested anthropologists may still obtain copies of the International Directory of Anthropologists (Section I; Western Hemisphere: Section II; Eastern Hemisphere) by writing to the Secretary of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology, National Re- search Council, 2101 Constitution Avenue, Washington, D. C. The price of the Directory is $2.00; either section may be obtained for $1.00. 179</page><page sequence="2">180 A MERICA N A NTIQ UIT Y [2, 1942 It is with regret that we belatedly announce the death of Glover M. Allen on Febru- ary 14. He was Curator of Mammals at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and Asso- ciate Professor of Zoology at Harvard University, but it is not generally known that he was also an ornithologist of some repute, and at the time of his death was editor of The Auk. He had identified remains of birds and mammals secured from excavations carried on by many archaeologists and took keen interest in the distributional data that were forthcoming. His friendly cooperation, quiet humor, keen interest, and willingness to help will be missed by all who came into contact with him in any way. On June 7, Dr. George A. Reisner, world-famous Egyptologist, died at the Pyramids of Gizeh where he had worked for more than forty years. The war did not stop his race against time and failing eyesight to reduce to a form available to others the notes that he had amassed, dictating from a hospital bed for a part of the winter. In Dr. Reisner's death the American school of archaeology looses one of its founders, for it was he who first laid stress on the importance of recording every detail observed in excavating at a time when museums were scrambling to outdo each other in the number or rarity of pieces. From Dr. Reisner's courses in Egyptology, given intermittently at Harvard, came the germ of the stratigraphic technique that was adapted and first used in America on a large dig at Pecos. His principles have since been accepted as sound, and have been put into practice in every archaeological field, both in the New World and the Old. ERRATUM Through some mischance a typographical error occurred in Eiseley's review of Hib- ben and Bryan's Evidences of Early Occupation of Sandia Cave after proof had been read by the author. In paragraph 4, page 415 of the April number of AMERICAN ANTIQUITY there occurs a sentence "Upon the faunal remains, however, this reviewer would venture a comment directed less at Hibben than at what seems a widespread and unfortunate trend toward giving the results of paleontological identifications with gravity and little emphasis upon the condition or quantity of the material upon which such identifications are based." This should have read " . . . giving the results of paleontological identifica- tions with brevity and little emphasis.... We apologize to the reviewer and to the author for any difficulties this regrettable error may have caused them. ANNOUNCEMENT The University of Montana is pleased to announce the formation of The Montana University Publications in the Social Sciences by recent action of the State Board of Edu- cation. The following manuscripts are either in press or in process of editing. The fiscal or- ganization of the University is such that it is not convenient to offer these monographs for sale. We wish to place these volumes in the proper hands, however, and offer to send them gratis to persons who express their interests by asking for them until the editions are exhausted. We would appreciate, however, having persons not on our exchange lists remitting the stamp values they find on the covers upon their receipt. Due to the exigencies of war times and the uncertain military status of our staff, we are attempting to publish all completed or nearly completed manuscripts as soon as pos- sible. This strain on our budget will make it necessary to publish the longer papers in mimeograph or lithograph. Papers whose illustrations are of scientific significance will be printed. For similar reasons, we would like to receive requests for any or all of these pa- pers at one time instead of by separate announcement.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 181 The following are ready, or will be within the next few months: 1.

HARRY TURNEY-HIGH, Editor Montana State University Missoula, Montana SOUTHWESTERN AREA From February 1 to April 30, 1942, the Arizona State Museum in cooperation with the CCC-ID excavated in Ventana Cave on the Papago Indian Reservation in south-cen- tral Arizona under the supervision of Mr. Julian D. Hayden, formerly National Park Service-CCC archaeologist. Some 400 cubic meters of material were handled during this season and the excavations are now considered completed. The general outline of the stratigraphy as reported last year has been verified and certain problems were greatly strengthened by further evidence secured from the extensive stratified debris which reaches a maximum depth of five meters. Briefly outlined, the deposits may be divided on the basis of genesis into two layers, each with subdivisions. The first and upper layer is midden material and therefore man- made, including two or more zones. The upper one to two meters carry pottery, represent- ing the full range of Hohokam types as well as some others, and the lower two to three meters are rich in the grinding and chipped implements related to the two final stages of Sayles' Cochise culture on the one hand and to the early California desert groups on the other hand. Modern fauna occurred throughout the midden deposit. The second and deepest deposit was nature-laid. Man frequented the cave at this time and some of his tools, charcoal, and bones of the animals he evidently ate, became mixed with the water-deposited volcanic debris which constitutes the bulk of the layer. All of this was securely cemented together by lime. The evidence suggests that this layer was put down during a wet cycle; which one has not yet been decided. The fauna includes horse, bison, sloth and tapir, and the complex represented by the implements is more nearly like Folsom than any other known early culture. The cultural continuity is broken at the base of the midden layer which rests dis- conformably upon the deeper cemented volcanic debris. The physical and faunal differ- ences above and below the disconformity are also marked and it may be inferred that this represents a considerable lapse of time with one or more culture stages missing. The Society hopes to publish a preliminary report on the site in the January number of AMERICAN ANTIQUITY. EMIL W. HALTRY</page><page sequence="4">182 A MERICA N ANTIQ UITY [2, 1942 SECOND ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE The Second Round Table Conference on Anthropological Problems of Mexico and Central America, sponsored by the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia, was held at Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, April 27 to May 1, 1942. The subject of the Conference was "Mayas and Olmecs," but discussion centered around the identity of the historical 01- mecs and about the archaeological "Olmec" complex. The Conference was especially significant for anthropology since it demonstrated, as did the First Round Table Conference, the possibility of attacking a given anthropologi- cal problem through the various branches of the science. Papers which were presented had been solicited by the program committee and were designed to attack the problem from the points of view of: (1) the Olmecs of the traditions and early sources; (2) the archaeo- logical "Olmec" complex; (3) the "Olmec" physical type. The papers which were de- livered under these heads were divided among the following persons: I. The Olmecs of the Traditions 1. Connection Between the Olmecs, Toltecs and Mayas, According to the Tradi- tions: Wigberto Jim6nez Moreno. 2. Geographical Distribution of Culture Traits Attributed to the Olmecs by the Traditions: Paul Kirchoff. 3. The Olmecs of the Historical Sources: Salvador Toscano. 4. Linguistic Groups in Chiapas and their Historical Sequence: Jorge A. Viv6. 5. Languages of the Popoloca-Mixtecan Stock and Their Relation to Macro- Otomangue: Roberto J. Weitlaner. 6. The Relationship Between Totonac, Mixe-Zoque, and Mayance, or the Macro- Mayance Linguistic Stock: Norman A. McQuown. II. The Archaeological "Olmeci" Complex 1. Definition and Distribution: Alfonso Caso. 2. Origin and Development of the Artistic Style: Miguel Covarrubias. 3. Relation with Other Cultures a. Archaic: Eduardo Noguera. (Read by Jim6nez Moreno.) b. The "Q" Complex: George C. Vaillant. c. Monte Alb6n: Jorge Acosta. (Read by Alfonso Caso.) d. Southern Vera Cruz and Recent Discoveries at La Venta: Matthew W.

Thompson. (Read by Alfred V. Kidder.) i. El Tajin: Jos6 Garcia Pay6n. 4. Maya-Toltec Cosmology and Chronology: H. J. Spinden. III. The Physical Type of Cerro de las Mesas: Juan Comas. Jorge A. Lines came from Costa Rica to join the discussion and present evidence of "Olmec" influence in Costa Rica in the form of a jade figurine recently found in that country and certainly belonging to the "Olmec" style, now termed the "La Venta" style. After the completion of Section I, Dr. Caso delivered a very brilliant summary of all the points that had been covered by the participants in that section. Following this sum- mary, the archaeological papers were presented. Tentative general conclusions could not be reached, but on the following points all participants agreed. Archaeology. It is proposed that the term "La Venta culture" be substituted for the former provisional term "Olmec," since the greatest number of traits belonging to this culture occur at this site.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS 183 Archaeological research in the Valley of Mexico, Michoacln, Morelos, Oaxaca, northern and southern Vera Cruz, Tabasco, the Pet6n, the Guatemala Highlands, and at CopAn has shown that there is a cultural horizon which has been called the Archaic-the oldest yet known-with which the La Venta culture is associated. (Spinden objected that the La Venta culture is highly specialized and cannot be considered as an antecedent of other Middle American cultures.) Investigations have shown four fundamental levels in Middle America as indicated: BASIC TRAITS AND CORRELATION OF THE CULTURE HORIZONS IN MIDDLE AMERICA Veracruz Valley Valley Basic and Peten of of Tat Tabasco Oaxaca Mexico Traits Cempoala- Aztec III-IV IV Cerro (Tenochca) (Mixtec- Montoso Puebla) Monte Albin Metals 'V-V Tajin Mazapa Matlatzinca- Coyotlatelco III Tajfn Tepeu Monte Albin TeotihuacAn Vases with III B IV-V painted human figures Tajfn Tzakol Monte Albin Teotihuacin III A II-III II Chicanel, Temple E VII Monte Albin Stelae sub (Uaxac- II Basal- tun) flanged pottery Tres Zapotes Monte Albin Ticomin Lower II I La Venta Writing, I ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dates, (Archaic) Tres Zapotes Colossal Lower I Mamom Zacatenco statues, Architecture Although the La Venta culture is included in the lowest horizon, some of its traits persist into more recent cultures. The style of some of the clay figurines of Tres Zapotes lower I and II is related to that of the stone sculpture of this site, as well as to that of La Venta. The style of the clay figurines of the La Venta culture is closely related to types D, C III, and A of the Archaic found in the Valley of Mexico.</page><page sequence="6">184 A MERICA N A NTIQ UIT Y [2, 1942 Sculpture of the La Venta style characteristically portrays two physical types; one with a broad flat nose and very thick lips, the other, with finer nose and more delicate lips. However, there are characteristics common to both that warrant placing them within one group. Apparently fat individuals are represented, hence there are certain constant features, such as rounded or pear-shaped heads, fat cheeks, thick necks, slant- ing puffy eyes with epicanthic fold, prominent chins, and chubby bodies. The people represented were apparently of low stature. The traits of the La Venta culture include the following: very extensive use of grey- green, spinach-green, blue-green, or less frequently grass-green jade; seated or standing figurines; large cylindrical or spherical beads; circular and rectangular ear plugs; clay figurines of a number of types, (a) with raised buttons of clay in Tres Zapotes II style, (b) solid type with mongoloid eye, (c) "baby face" type with fat cheeks, (d) solid bearded type; pyramidal earth mounds set on rectangular platforms; colossal axes; plaque-axes; jade axes; masks with hollowed back; small cabochon masks; disks with representation of tiger-like mouth or face; pectoral plaques; plaque beads; palettes; replicas in jade of claws and clam shells; needles, spatulas and punches of jade; bow-shaped stones; spiral motif rare in decorative art; and an absence of feather ornaments. To these general traits Dr. Stirling adds the following, so far known only from La Venta: altars, generally with a figure seated cross-legged in a niche at the front; colossal heads of the broad-nosed, thick-lipped type; stelae with figures in relief (bearded men); extensive use of natural columns of basalt; rectangular tomb made of basalt col- umns; sarcophagus in the form of a conventionalized jaguar, with rectangular cover; rec- tangular anthropomorphic limestone monuments; jade beads in the form of sections of bamboo; amethyst beads (one found); square carved ear plugs; great rectangular plat- forms surrounded with vertically-set basalt columns; elongated ellipsoidal mounds; and a tendency to orient sculptures and monuments north and south. Physical Anthropology. Although examination of the scanty skeletal material from the lower levels of Cerro de las Mesas fails to substantiate the existence of the physical type that appears to be represented in the anthropomorphic La Venta art, one deformed skull from the level next above very closely parallels the typical La Venta human fig- ures. It is suggested that a detailed study of the somatological characteristics of the La Venta figures be made, following in so far as possible the morphological criteria. The two physical types that are represented in the figurines may be designated as the short broad type and the tall type; in the first of these, the figurines with chubby bodies are included, in the latter, the individuals with long arms and legs. Linguistics. Concerning the Macro-Otomanguean phyllum it appears that lexicograph- ical similarities favor the inclusion of Mazatec in the Popoloca group which comprises Popoloca, Ixcatec, Chocho, and Mazatec; that Trique is closer to the Mixtec group than to the Popoloca, especially to the Mixtec language; that Cuicatec also is related to the Mixtec group and to Trique; and that Amusgo is provisionally tied to the Mixtec group. A stock called the Macro-Mayance also takes shape. Definition of a Macro-Mayance stock was offered, which includes the Totonac-Zoque group, comprising Totonac-Tepe- hua and Mixe-Zoque, and the Mayance group. Ethnography. When the occurrence of culture traits attributed to the Olmecs by early documents is plotted on the map, it will be found that these traits are divided geograph- ically into two groups, the first occurring in the Lowlands, the second, in the Highlands. Sahagun is the only source for the Lowland culture traits, ascribable to the Olmecs of southern Vera Cruz and the adjoining portions of Tabasco. The Historia Tolteca-Chichi- meca, Mufioz Camargo, and Ixtlilxochitl are those who mention the Highland group, re- ferring to the Olmecs of Cholula and Tlaxcala.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS 185 In the Lowland group belong on the one hand, culture elements that are found among all the peoples of the Gulf Coast, southward from the Pinuco River, among the Maya of Yucatan, Chiapas and Guatemala, etc., and among people like the Pipil, Nicarao and Chorotega-Mangue who are the mGst southern outliers of Middle American culture. Among the traits within this area of distribution are: tattooing, different forms of head shaving, filed teeth, intentional tooth blackening, different forms of nose ornament, crani- al deformation of different types, beards, the division of the year into eighteen months, the Volador ceremony, confession of sins to Tlazolteotl, tigers, etc., and mutilation of the penis (circumcision of children and self-sacrifice of blood). On the other hand, some of the enumerated traits, together with a few others such as copper axes or mactepuztli, human heads or the skin of the face as trophies, the quech- quemitl, sodomy as a recognized institution, five as a ceremonial number, etc., are found outside the mentioned zones in the region of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The best example of the Highland traits consists of two weapons with associated distribution: the macuahitl or wooden sword-club with inset obsidian blades, and the ichcahuippilli, or quilted cotton armor. The two other weapons which are also mentioned by historians as being used by the Olmecs of the Highlands, the bow and the shield, have a distribution much greater than the regions already mentioned, exceeding the bounds of Middle America. However, they are not found in Cuechtecapan and Totonacapan, the part of the Gulf Coast that appears to have preserved best that culture which is regarded as being associated with the most ancient phase of Olmec history. History. An examination of the historical sources shows that the term "Olmec" means "inhabitant of the region where rubber grows," which is precisely in southern Vera Cruz and northern Tabasco. The name might be applied to a series of peoples of different ethnic and linguistic affiliations, occupying the zone either successively or simultaneously. These authorities clearly indicate that some Olmecs lived in the Highlands, and that some Olmecs lived in the rubber region of the coastal Lowlands. They also refer to different periods, some, more recent, and some, more ancient. The La Venta culture is centered primarily in the region in which rubber grows, hence it must have been the culture of one of the peoples who in ancient times occupied this zone. The most recent Olmecs mentioned in the historical sources seem to have been Mixtec and Nahua speaking groups. According to these sources they were living in two localities: (1) at Cholula at the time when the Tolteca-Chichimeca arrived; and (2) at Chalco when the Chalca-Totolimpaneca arrived. The Mixtec and Nahua speaking Olmecs may have been responsible for the pottery known as Aztec I and Cholula (Altar de los Craneos). This type of ceramics is also connected with the pottery of the Mixtec and that from Cerro Montoso. As can be seen, the historical approach identifies the Olmecs of the historical sources as the "nahuatized" Popoloca-Mixtec; Jim6nez Moreno went so far as to indi- cate that some of the recent Olmecs might have been responsible for the Aztec I and Cho- lula ceramics. On the other hand, the archaeological La Venta culture can be clearly defined. Its pure art style and its characteristic traits, which can be identified from Monta Albin through the Highlands to Uaxactun in the Peten, as well as along the Gulf Coast, be- long to the Archaic culture horizon. Evidence of the existence of any "La Venta style" physical type was lacking from the majority of the scanty skeletal material from the lower levels of Cerro de las Mesas, although one deformed skull from a level immediately</page><page sequence="8">186 A MERICA N A NTIQ UITY [2, 1942 above these skulls is identical in form with the La Venta style of representations of human heads. Ethnography shows that a group of traits linked with the Olmecs of the historical sources is distributed from the Gulf Coast of Vera Cruz on the north to the Pacific Coast of Mexico and southward as far as Nicaragua. HIowever this group of traits cannot be connected in any way with the archaeological material of La Venta which belongs to the antecedent Archaic culture horizon, and there appeared to be no links by which the two could be connected. The reconstruction of the history of the Olmec region put forward by Jimenez Moreno appeared as an hypothesis which should be discussed further, prin- cipally in regard to the intermediate culture horizons, because the necessary minute de- tails proving archaeologically a connection'between historic and prehistoric tribes was not yet available. Dr. Kidder suggested that the results of Jim6nez Moreno's researches be published in Theoretical Approaches to Problems in order that the hypothesis might be better known and widely discussed with the hope that future excavations might add the missing data. The Conference approved of this suggestion and accepted the work of Jim6nez Moreno as an hypothesis. The Conference then adjourned, leaving the identity of the authors of the La Venta culture still unsettled, after agreeing that the subject of the next Round Table Conference would be anthropological problems of the north of Mexico in relation to those of the Southeast and Southwest of the United States. The date and place of the meeting was left to be decided at a later date. The following were appointed to the Organizing Com- mittee: Donald D. Brand, Daniel F. Rubin de la Borbolla, Gordon F. Ekholm, Alfred V. Kidder, Ignacio Marquina, Wigberto Jim6nez Moreno, John R. Swanton. A full report of this conference will be found in Mayas y Olmecas published by the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia. THIRD ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE The organizing committee announces that the Third Round Table Conference will be held in northern Mexico, with preference Durango, or Tamulipas, during the early or late summer of 1943. Tho subject.will be "Northern Mexico and the Relationship Between the Cultures of Middle America and Those of the Southeast and Southwest of the United States." A tentative program involves: I) Introduction: (1) An outline of the problems, (2) Geographical setting, (3) A discussion of Early Man in the area; II) Northern Mexico in respect to the three neighboring areas: (1) Physical anthro- pology, (2) Linguistics, (3) Ethnology and history, (4) Archaeology; III) Relations be- tween Middle America and the two areas in the United States: (1) The Southeast, (2) The Southwest, (3) Correlations between Middle American chronology and South- western dendrochronology.</page></plain_text>
