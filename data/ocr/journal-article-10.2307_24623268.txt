The main theme will center on the question: to what extent and in which ways have "magic" and "belief" constituted part and parcel of people's concep tions, representations, and explanations of health and illness, and their reactions to illness? Special attention will be given to: language, rationality, tolerance, civilization, medical market, and gender. Further information and call for papers: Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra, Depart ment of History, University of Amsterdam, Spuistraat 134, 1012 VB Amster dam, Netherlands.

The Lester Dragstedt Memorial Symposium: Current Status of Acid Peptic Disease was held 1 October 1993 beginning at 8:00 a.m. in the Beaumont Room, Yale University School of Medicine. At 5:00 p.m., a historical lecture to memorialize Dr. Dragstedt's contributions was given in the History of Medicine Library as the first lecture of the academic year for the Beaumont Medical Club. The meeting was sponsored by the Department of Surgery and organized by I. M. Modlin, M.D. The Symposium was in memory of L. R. Dragstedt, one of the pioneers of the study and treatment of peptic ulcer disease in the United States. Dragstedt was unique in being the first surgeon scientist in America. Prior to becoming the Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Chicago, he was the Chairman of Physiology at Northwestern University. The Symposium was dedicated to his memory and dealt with the current physiology of the [ 476 ]</page><page sequence="2">Notes and Events 477 stomach and the medical and surgical management of peptic ulcer disease. A broad spectrum of information relating to mucosal function, drug therapy, and the evolution of surgical management was discussed by approximately seventy nationally and internationally recognized authorities who had been invited to participate. These included G. Sachs, Los Angeles; W. G. Creutzefeldt, Germany; H. Baron, England; L. Olbe, Sweden; M. Lewin, France; I. N. Marks, South Af rica; D. Graham, Houston; H. DeBas, San Francisco; E. Passaro, Los Angeles.

For the past three years, the A AHM has sponsored a discussion group addressing the concerns and research interests of clinician-historians: the Clinician-Historian Group of the American Association for the History of Medicine. This deliber ately cumbersome term was created to be as broad as possible in its definition and includes any interested AAHM member who is engaged or wishes to be engaged in scholarly medical historical research as well as the clinical practice of medicine. Consequently, the constituency of the group is rather wide, including "professional clinician-historians" (i.e., those academicians who are members of university-based clinical departments and are conducting medical historical research as the scholarly component of their positions), practicing physicians who still find time in their schedules for historical work, and students or trainees who are engaged in programs that combine clinical and professional historical instruction in some fashion. The Clinician-Historian Group has continued to grow each year. At the Louisville AAHM meetings, there were over 90 clinician-historians at the infor</page><page sequence="3">478 Journal of the History of Medicine : Vol. 48, October 1993 mal breakfast meeting. These meetings have developed into a successful forum for the discussion of professional and research issues as well as a means for clinician-historians from different institutions to interact with one another. An invaluable contribution of this group has been the development of a "Clinician-Historian Directory" which makes available the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and research interests of the group's members. The first edition of this Directory was distributed shortly before the Louisville AAHM meeting this past May. Additional copies of the Directory can be obtained (and changes made in existing Directory listings) by writing to Walton Schalick (see below for address). Another important program that is currently being developed is a mentorship plan to facilitate research, advice, and dialogue between senior and junior or beginning clinician-historians. Those who have volunteered to serve as "men tors" are marked with an asterisk in the Directory. Further, the group is col laborating with the creators of the successful writing workshops offered by the AAHM and conducted by Drs. Jacalyn Duffin, Bruce Fye, and Todd Savitt, in order to better serve the educational needs of this group. More information about this program will be forthcoming as the year progresses. Finally, it is necessary that plans begin now for next year's "Clinician-Histo rian Breakfast Meeting" which is to be held at the 1994 AAHM meeting in New York. The suggestions for topics of discussion have included: (1) a session discussing the graduate education options available to M. D. s or medical students desiring M.A., Ph.D., or simply course instruction. A panel of history of medicine graduate program directors would be invited as speakers; (2) a session that focuses on the various trends occurring in medical history, including the often-observed point that most physicians who are involved in medical history research tend to concentrate on nineteenth- and twentieth-century topics; and (3) a selected speaker discussing his or her research and how that compliments (or detracts) from one's clinical work. There has been no program set as yet, so please feel free to contact either of the following with suggestions or questions.

At their annual meeting in Louisville on 13 May 1993, they began by introducing themselves and summarizing their research interests, a practice which they will continue at future meetings. Their two current projects include a student directory and a sources of funding direc tory. The student directory is now entering its second edition, under the editorship of Sandy Jahn (University of Minnesota). The first edition is now on-line through the Johns Hopkins History of Science gopher. The second edition will appear on a new gopher named SHOCAS at Minnesota which will be dedicated solely to SHOCAS information. It will also be available on hard copy (expected out this fall) and will be sent to respondents of the questionnaire. The funding directory will appear in the early Fall, and will be distributed to responding departments on hard copy after appearing initially on-line through the Hopkins gopher. Later it will be moved to the Minnesota SHOCAS gopher. As many students had questions about the process of getting articles pub lished, it was decided that a brief how-to session would be held at next year's meeting. The AAHM has been very supportive in both financial and advisory roles, but SHOCAS needs a mechanism to ensure continuity of its activities as students come and go.
