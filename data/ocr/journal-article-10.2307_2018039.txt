This is a translation of the fourth edition of Canon Nys's well- known four-volume treatise on cosmology, published 1922-1928 as Volume VII of Cardinal Mercier's Course de Philosophie. The first two volumes of the original are fairly faithfully reproduced in the present edition. This part of the treatise is a critical survey of types of physical theories whose central notions have often been taken as ultimate explanatory categories in the study of the in- organic world. Among the conceptions examined are those of classical mechanics, of the neo-mechanics of Helmholtz, Boltzmann, and Maxwell, of the dynamism of Leibniz and Boscovich, and of the energism of Ostwald, Mach, and Duhem. The basic assumptions of these theories are evaluated in terms of the evidence provided by the various branches of physics and chemistry, as well as on the basis of canons of intelligibility supplied by Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics. It is perhaps needless to add that Nys finds the principles of scholastic cosmology to be in agreement with all the discoveries of modern science, and that he judges the various types of mechanical theory, however great may be their heuristic value, to be unintelligible as ultimate explanations of physical and chemi- cal change. The remaining two volumes of the original treatise (published as La notion de temps and La notion d'espace) have been severely condensed in the present translation, so that although their main argument is retained, many interesting analyses contained in the</page><page sequence="2">302 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY original are not available to the English reader. The discussion of time includes among other issues the relation of time and duration, the status of the past, time as the measure of movement, the reversi- bility and relativity of time, and the beginning and end of time; and there is also an examination of types of philosophical theories concerning time. The final part of the work is devoted to the analysis of the nature of space; the French original for this was reviewed in this JOURNAL, Vol. XX (1923), pp. 277-278. Both for time and space the Thomistic conclusions are adopted and de- fended. The present edition also includes a small amount of new material, including an appendix by Professor James A. McWilliams of St. Louis University, intended to bring Nys's treatise abreast with recent scientific developments. Notwithstanding these addi- tions, the issues raised by relativity theory for the hylomorphism defended in this work receive only a cavalier treatment, and the discussion of the physics of discontinuous phenomena is in the main quite inadequate. Nys 's treatise is an impressive one, and those to whom the French edition has been inaccessible now have the opportunity to enjoy what is in many ways a refreshing intellectual experience. For even the present abridged translation exhibits the virtues of scholastic scholarship and the vigor and thoroughness of Nys 's mind. The book will afford genuine pleasure, even when it fails to convince, to those who admire dialectic skill, and who think well of logic and the consideration of relevant evidence as grounds for accepting or rejecting a doctrine. On the other hand, the treatise also reveals the limitations of neo-scholastic philosophy. For it exhibits Nys's unquestioning, and therefore dogmatic, reliance on Thomistic principles; and it also shows those principles to have frequently no more than a verbal content, and to be useless as guides for understanding modern scientific inquiry. In general, so it appears to this reviewer, Nys is able to maintain his funda- mental assumptions against modern critics largely because those assumptions are so vague that they can be brought into agreement with any specific empirical findings once these latter have been established. But principles which are compatible with every possi- ble state of affairs obviously can not have a determinate factual content. Two examples selected almost at random may help to confirm this judgment. Thus, the conversion of mass into energy is de- clared to be philosophically inadmissible, because "it would mean that mass (a subsiance) could become energy (an accident) " (Vol. I, p. 17). And further on Mach's operational definition of mass is rejected because this definition "gives no information concern-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 303 ing the intimate nature of this mysterious factor." The definition which is offered as satisfactory is that "the mass of a body is its dimensive quantity" since "by its quantity a body fulfills the func- tion of mass and possesses the properties belonging to this me- chanical factor" (Vol. II, p. 93). Accordingly, the conversion of mass into energy, as maintained by recent physics, is reinterpreted so as to conform to the dicta of Thomistic metaphysics. But the reader who is puzzled by this performance must ask in turn what bearing the notion of mass as "substance" has upon the conception of mass as relevant to modern physical theory; and he can only wonder how the proposed definition of mass will enable him to understand what is being asserted in current scientific investiga- tions. But perhaps an even clearer case of the verbal character of the hylomorphic metaphysics is found in the discussion of the transmission of motion from a body in motion to another at rest. The possibility of such a transmission is denied, on the ground that when the body at rest is struck by the body in motion the former first acquires a "motor quality" which then sets it into motion. Nys explains the matter as follows: Motion, made concrete and individual by the subject in which it inheres, is intrinsically dependent upon that subject and must remain attached to it if it is not to disappear from the world of reality. . . . It is impossible, there- fore, for motion to migrate from one substance into another. . . . Two bodies move. One comes to rest, the other gains in motion what the former loses. If there is no transmission of motion, what is the cause of this twofold effect? Our answer is that the theory of motor qualities affords the only solution to this apparent mystery. At the moment of contact, the mechanical energy of the moving body produces in the mobile object an impulse, i.e., a motor energy which immediately sets the mobile object in motion. But every action gives rise to an equal and contrary reaction. The mobile object, therefore, reacts in turn on the moving body by resisting it, and the fluctuations of these energies, by nature antagonistic and of the same intensity, result inevitably in the sudden arrest in motion of the moving body. [Vol. I, pp. 161-162.] But the puzzled reader must again ask, what evidence is there for these motor qualities, which have been postulated ad hoc to do the job that the bodies are precluded from doing by the requirements of Thomism? What illumination is produced by invoking hidden agents to do the work of identifiable bodies, when those agents are no less mysterious than the apparent action of bodies on one an- other ? And just what is the explanatory force of teleological categories in this context? But to the question why physical processes should be inherently more intelligible when described in anthropomorphic terms, Nys 's treatise provides no answer. On the contrary, when one notes that for Nys the "principle or law of continuity: Nature never proceeds by leaps" has a scientific worth</page><page sequence="4">304 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY not inferior to the principle of least action (interpreted in teleo- logical terms), the conclusion forced on the reader is that the metaphysics of hylomorphism has little to contribute to a sober understanding of physical and chemical processes.
