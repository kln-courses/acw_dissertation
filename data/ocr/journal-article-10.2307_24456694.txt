What then is its therapeutic value? Without going into a detailed discussion, I shall simply present the conclusions to which it seems a serious study of the documents must lead. In my opinion, the psychoanaly tic method—in spite of the logically imperfect form Freud, like almost all great innovators, has given to his dis covery—is not only an instrument of in vestigation capable of producing exact results, but also something that can lead to the cure of neurosis and perhaps even psychosis. (When it is a question of psychosis, however, schizophrenia, men tal automatism and so on, it would be preferable to discuss the ideas of Bleuler and Jung instead of Freud's.) It would be absurd to make psychoanal ysis the sole therapeutic instrument for the cure of neuroses. It is one of the therapeutic instruments for the cure of certain neuroses, but the mechanism of cure in this case is especially interesting for philosophy. "As soon as the uncon scious processes become conscious," Freud writes, "the symptoms disappear." It is not an abstract notion of the past that de-repression causes to return to the light of day, but the concrete past with the existential certitude proper to the intuition of memory.2 This is indispens able. It has been said that "the artificial provocation of the phenomena of hyper amnesia* remains one of the pillars of the psychoanalytic edifice." The patient now has before him his own uncon scious, his own past misfortune, his own psychic wounds—inasmuch as they are his, pertain in an ineradicable manner to his own irreversible past and form one body with his own existence. Provo * Pathological degree of retention and recall, es pecially of details. 311 cation of hyperamnesia is not enough, however. Intelligence must intervene. The interpretation made by the patient or recognized by him as true reveals to him the causal connection between the materials of his past life and the dis turbance he is now suffering. It is im portant to understand that it is a matter of an intellectual act of awareness that has nothing to do with deduction, but is an intuition bearing upon the very fibers of the subject's psychic tis sue. Automatically, through the sole fact of this prise de conscience, the au tomatisms created by the unconscious are made to disappear. The light of the intelligence dispells them. Every cure of a neurotic symptom by psychoanaly sis bears testimony to the radical health of intelligence and consciousness. To indicate how this sort of cure can be spontaneous, I will cite a case of which I have direct knowledge. A young girl experienced symptoms of anxiety, that were becoming more distressing every year, whenever she found herself in an enclosure like a closed room or the compartment of a train. She happened to be an open soul and was accustomed to see herself clearly. One day when she was taking a walk in the country she said to herself, "It is not possible. There must be some explanation for it." She then began to reflect on her past. Sud denly the memory of a completely for gotten incident of her early childhood came to mind. When she was about three years old, she was once with her father whom she rarely saw and whom she greatly feared. (The father was sep arated from her mother.) She wanted to leave the room they were in. The instant she turned the knob on the door, her father put on the lock that was placed too high for the child's hand to reach. She made for the window. But her father closed the window and stood in front of it. The child felt herself im</page><page sequence="6">312 CROSS CURRENTS prisoned and overcome with anxiety and technique, namely, the analysis of spon humiliation.

There is no question of that at all. It is simply a question of the dangers it presents, the reasons for which I have tried to indicate. It is clear that in cer tain cases it is proper to resort to danger ous medication. When an abnormal connection between the conscious and the unconscious betrays itself by a neu rotic symptom that is ravaging a human life, there should be no hesitation about trying psychoanalysis if nosological in dications call for it, and if also one is placed in the hands of a good psycho analyst. To have recourse to psycho analysis as one takes aspirin, however, betokens a very costly naïveté.6 Before concluding this section, in con nection with the question of moral licit ness, I would like to indicate the way certain investigators proceed on the pre text of being scientific. To verify ex perimentally the value of Freudian sym bolism, Schrôtter and Roffenstein would hypnotize their subjects and suggest they dream of some disgusting obscenity whispered into their ear in order to see how the obscene image would be dis guised in the dream. Betlheim and Hartmann chose patients affected with certain associative disturbances (Korsa kov's syndrome) and made them learn by heart certain prose pieces, offensive in content, in order to see what spon taneous symbolizations could be veri fied when the subjects later recited the pieces. This sort of experiment on poor sick people, who are treated as specimens and whose imagination is undoubtedly harmed, raises questions about the mor al assumptions animating the experi menters. Freudian Psychology Tn my opinion, it is above all for the notion of psychic dynamism that Freudian psychology must be given cred it. Other psychologists had already 315 brought it to light with greater philo sophical force, Bergson in particular. Freud, however, made remarkably fertile use of it in the field of psychiatry and empiriological knowledge.* The pro found life of the unconscious appeared to him to be composed of tendencies, de sires, instincts and impulses unlike me chanical forces and comparable to vital energies directed from within towards an end, each of them working to attain its object with the fierce tenacity, flexibility and artfulness of life. Freud went to extremes in this regard, but the restora tion of dynamism and finality has very great value in the eyes of a Thomist. He carried the role of instincts and af fectivity to such excess that he seems to see the whole human being in their terms. It remains true, nevertheless, that he forcefully attracted attention to a part of the psychic life of the animal endowed with reason that had generally been neglected because it was masked by higher functions. On the other hand, it is true that he employed a language that was extremely anthropomorphic and mythological. In my opinion, it was the price he had to pay for the correct methodological feeling, if I may use the expression, that he had about psychology as an empiriological science. (The un fortunate thing was that he himself wanted to make a philosophy of man out of this empiriological science, and that succeeded in confusing everything.) It is a well known fact that with re gard to what he calls the psychopatho logy of everyday life, his originality con sisted in assuming that even occurrences such as lapses, forgetfulness, mistakes, omissions and the like have a meaning, that is, that they are at the same time effects and signs of hidden affective ten dencies. His dream theory is equally * On the distinction between empiriological knowl edge and ontological knowledge, cf.

It is appro priate to point out here that in the first place the human species is a species that cannot live and develop except in a state of culture. In the second place, the laws of cultural morality precisely tend to lessen the causes of the sufferings and evils to which the species is exposed and to add to its creative tension but they cannot tend to this end, however, with out striking the individual harshly. Con sequently morality becomes for humani ty a yoke, as intolerable as it is indis pensable, unless love comes to alleviate it and the sway of divine mercy comes to compensate for the demands of law, not abolishing them, but superadding other and better requirements to them. This creates for those for whom, through undeserved luck, the fulfilment of the law is less strenuous, unique duties of friendship and fraternal respect towards the others. This is not the place, how ever, to begin a discussion of this theme. In conclusion, I would like to point out that in Freud we find an outstand ing example of the statistical law accord ing to which great discoveries—especial ly when they relate to the world of sense —because of the unfortunate condition of man and his lack of strength to sus tain the truth, seem to need violent af fective stimulation, which, as it inspires and guides research, at the same time inclines the intellect to error. In the final analysis, however, error serves the truth in spite of itself.13 Thanks to the fact that reason as a consequence feels obliged to undertake the processes of purification and reintegration, it is the truth that will again have the last word.

Cf. for example, Dr. Michel Gressot, "Les indications et la technique de la cure psychanaly tique", in Medecine et Hygiene, Geneva, 15 Novem ber 1952, p. 17. "Finally the indication must be weighed with prudence when it is urged that the process be supported by a conflictual situation, but the "prise de conscience" of that dependence, or a reversal in the pathogenic situation, would place be fore the patient a risk of disequilibrium or more serious depression, for example, in the case of dis location of irreplaceable family ties, as completely neurotic as they might nevertheless be . . . However, contra-indication is not equivalent in these matters to therapeutic nihilism, for the alternative posed in general is not psychoanalysis or abstention, but psychoanalysis or psychotherapy of another type—a radical treatment or, by default, a symptomatic treatment. And in doubtful cases, one can resort for a time to a "trial-psychoanalysis" aimed at clarifying the prognostication. 1 A more general and much more significant prob lem is the one that concerns the relationship of psychotherapy (and not just psychological investiga tion) to ethics. Certain passages from an article I have published on the work of Roland Dalbiez can appropriately be reproduced at this point. "In the forceful and suggestive discussion in which he insists upon referring to the specific object and the proper limits of psychotherapy (op.cit., t. II, p. 407-408), Dalbiez writes that the education of the will, by reason of the end to be pursued, is a moral and religious task, and not one for psycho therapy. Psychotherapy is distinguished from moral and religious education not only by its end, but also by its means. Whereas ethics and religion make use of freedom, psychotherapy avails itself of a certain determinism. It is absolutely necessary to emphasize this point strongly because it is ignored by many authors in practice and in theory. The phenomena that psychotherapy attempts to modify</page><page sequence="17">JACQUES MAINTAIN 323 are pathological phenomena and not moral faults. Its end is not to render people virtuous, but to restore them to health. When it is a question of bodily health, its distinction from virtue is com pletely evident. Nobody declares that palpitations of the heart are moral faults. When it is a question of psychic health, however, it is curious to find how certain people confuse it with virtue. Even in the realm of normality, however, the distinction be tween psychological determinism and morality is easy to grasp. Intellectual and artistic aptitudes are incontestably something psychological, but they do not pertain to morality. Nobody can be blamed morally for his lack of aptitude for mathematics or sculpturing. The most heroic moral efforts run aground trying to overcome the limitations of psychic capacities. A fortiori it is the same in the realm of abnormal psychic life. Will power counts for nothing in the presence of a feeling of depersonalization. Psychic health, far from being confused with virtue, is presupposed by it. It can be appreciated, therefore, that while ethics sets out to realize the total and supreme good of man by means of free will, psychotherapy sets out to realize a human good that is partial and relative, namely, health, whether psychic or physical, by means of psychological determinism. To introduce the culti vation of the free will into psychotherapy is to be guilty of confusing essences". Roland Dalbiez pits his characteristically impla cable logic against this confusion. He pursues it among the disciples of Jung, as well as those of Jas pers. I am fully in accord with him on the necessity of the distinction. It is desirable that it be not badly understood and lead to forgetfulness of the fact that psychotherapy, like medicine in general, is not a speculative science, but a practical science, which proceeds modo compositivoy and constitutes an art extrinsically related to ethics, since the being whose aim it is to cure is a man, in whon^ freedom of choice and natural determinism interact. "The ex clusive role of psychotherapy is to relieve its client of strictly pathological phenomena and not to furnish him with a metaphysics, a system of ethics or a political theory." That much is understood. It can happen, however, that in order to relieve a certain individual of strictly pathological phenomena correction of the way he uses his free choice might have to enter into the picture. In the name of what so-called scientific integrity would the doctor be forbidden to point such a thing out to his client? In order to offset dispositions in them unfavorable to the healthy equilibrium of their biological ten dencies, Doctor Paul Carton counsels his patients about rules of dietetic moderation, but in addition, about abstention frorrç lying, resistance to vile speech, etc. Since it is a question in all this of bringing these people back to good heaUhy it is in view of an end proper to medicine that these pre scriptions, moral in their own nature, are "usurped" by the art of Hippocrates as a means to health. Likewise, it is not to be "prescinding" from morality, but on the contrary to be acting in con formity with an elementary moral law, not to aggravate the condition of a psychopath by attacking his convictions through clumsy moralizations or by burdening his will with tasks it cannot carry out (the moralist acts in the same way in cases that are not pathological). On the other hand, let us consider the way in which a physician behaves as a rule. When it is appropriate to administer a purgative or to apply a cupping-glass, the doctor purely and simply pre scribes the remedy in question. But if it seems to him that an action forbidden by the moral law, a fault involving sexual morality, for example, would be favorable to the disappearance of a neurosis or mental disorder, he abstains from prescribing such a remedy and contents himself with informing his patient about the state of the question, leaving the decision up to the latter's own free choice and moral code. If he is questioned from that point of view, he even counsels formally against it. What does this signify except that the medical art, in the person of the subject who exercises it and be cause of its own human purposes, recognizes its subordination to ethics, which forbids the doctor to induce another to commit a moral fault? The additional elucidations here presented in no way lessen the value of the methodological distinctions laid down by the author of a book whose admirable moral wholesomeness as much as its intellectual exactness merit the recognition of the psychologist and the medical man as well as the philosopher and the educated man who is anxious to obtain a sure orientation with regard to problems in which day by day so many incompetents become involved. From the point of view of the philosophy of knowledge, this book seems to me to be a unique example of purification by intelligence and a triumph of rationalism in the classical sense. In this respect it can be said to exemplify the French scientific tra dition in a very felicitous way, and in a manner the "spirit" of which restores to irrational vitality its proper value, reflecting on its discoveries. If it can be admitted that there are typical "temperaments" in the case of works of thought themselves, due to subjective conditions, in general nothing is more stimulating that to confront a doctrine and a thinker with contrary characteristics in this regard, provided the thinker does not follow the bent of his temperament, but the truth. No intellectual com plexions are more opposed to each other than that of Dalbiez the metaphysician, logician and intel lectual realist and Freudianism wholly vibrating with divinatory intuitions and the exasperated spir</page><page sequence="18">324 CROSS CURRENTS it of vindication. That is why the work of Dal biez teaces us such a useful lesson. As the author himself explains in the preface, he has not sought simply to give a descriptive exposition of Freud's thought, but to present it in its purest and most valid form, transposing it into a world of perfectly exact scientific method and logical clarity that Freud himself never knew. It is a tour de force that only a mind with the philosophical formation of Roland Dalbiez could produce. The result is an incomparable service rendered with regard to what is acceptable in psychoanalytic doctrine and at the same time with respect to criticism of what is un acceptable in it and philosophically erroneous. (Etu des Carmélitaines, April 1938: "Notes sur le freu disme, à propos de .l'ouvrage de Roland Dalbiez). 8 Religion and Culture, p. 16. 9 Concerning the notion of the superego and the authentic interpretation of this notion, see the im portant remarks of Dr. Odier in his work, Les deux sourcesy consciente et inconsciente, de la vie morale, 2nd edition, Neuchatel, 1947. 10 "Our interpretation of sublimation," writes M. T.-L. Penido, in La conscience religieuse, Essai systématique suivi d'illustration, Paris, Téqui, 1936, p. Ill, "differs from that of the Freudians on two fundamental points: 1) We do not admit that spir ituality is sublimated sexuality; 2) we admit a sublimation which functions under the domination of spiritual forces, and which consequently involves a certain purification or spiritualization of sensi bility." The author cites Charles Baudouin, "Sublimation et Synthèse," Kevue de Théologie et de Philosophie, January 1935, pp. 46-56: "When it is shown that a higher tendency proceeds from a displacement of a certain brute instinct, one is no more reducing the first to the second than one would pretend to be reducing man to lower organisms when he as sumes the evolution of living beings. The reality of sublimation must all the more be affirmed as there exist cases of precisely false sublimation, and one sees very well that then we are dealing with an entirely different thing (eroticization of the re ligious life, for example). We have the right to speak of a real sublimation when the whole of actual conduct is in conformity with motives set up by consciousness. On the contrary, we shall speak of rationalization and disguise when there is a flagrant discrepancy and conduct continues to be governed by the lower movements which the subject pretends to be renouncing." 11 He particularly neglects to recognize the spir itual unconscious, distinct by nature from the in stinctual unconscious. On the essential distinction between these two forms of the unconscious, see my book, Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry, ch. III. Pointing out to an audience of theologians the domain of this false consciousness, which adorns itself with the fairest pretexts, Doctor Charles Henri Nodet says quite rightly: "If you affirm, in the name of theology, the existence in all human behavior, and still more in every en gagement in the religious life, of a reality that is mysterious because supernatural, psychoanalysis re quires of you a complementary affirmation, namely, the existence, in all human behavior, of a reality mysterious because unconscious. Two domains, there fore, elude immediate, current, rational observation, two mysterious, extrarational domains, the super natural, where your discernment of spirits maintains rights I do not wish to contest, and unconscious life, where psychoanalytic investigation maintains rights that I ask you in turn not to contest." Con sidérations psychanalytiques à propos des attraits néurotiques pour la vocation religieuse, Bourges, Imprimerie Tardy, 1950, p. 6.—Cf. the same author, Psychiatrie et vie religieuse in the Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale, 195 5. 13 Since this study was originally composed, psy chotherapy has advanced considerably, and many new ideas have sprung up both outside the Freudian school (Baruk Stocker, Nodet.. .) and within the different schools related to Freud. A notable effort of reconstruction has thus been undertaken by cer tain psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and non-psycho analysts alike. Gregory Zilboorg recently wrote of a rapprochement between psychoanalysis and re ligion, "The love of God in Freud", Selection II, Sheed &amp; Ward. As a philosopher, I particularly appreciate the works of Zilboorg and Odier for the intellec tual value and elucidations they afford (the notion of psychological morality, in particular, that was in troduced by Odier, seems to me to be of great philosophical interest). On the other hand, it seems to me that Jung and several of those who are called "revisionists," while they indeed are restoring es sential values denied by Freud, have aggravated the confusion between the scientific realm and the philo sophical and moral realms in an irremediable way, making room for a sort of scientific mythology able to produce some remarkable results in therapeutic practice, but not much healthier for the intelligence than the "philosophy" of Freud. It should be noted that the cult of adaptation to the cultural milieu is as irrational as that of the individualistic claims of instinct.</page></plain_text>
