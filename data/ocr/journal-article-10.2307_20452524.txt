I say no. This polis is not an ideal to be applied to practice, but one aspiration among several to be seriously exam ined and consulted by political people as they deliberate about what to do in particular situations. The prayer presented in chapters 4-12 is not meant to be understood as Aristotle's own, but as coming from one imagined voice among the several presented in the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics. Would Aristotle pray for this regime? No. It is instead the prayer of a "real man" (an aner) fully committed to political life, someone who, unlike Aristotle, can imagine noth ing more beautiful than a beautiful polis. Aristotle's subtlety here has important implications for understanding the philosophy/politics relationship. Keywords: Aristotle; political philosophy; theory and practice; utopia Sometimes, focusing on a discrete interpretive puzzle in a philosophical text can lead to insights about theoretical issues that go well beyond the possible meanings of the text in question. This is the case with Aristotle's discussion of the best regime in Book 7 of the Politics. By working through the details of Book 7, I hope to bring to light a conception of the work of political theorists that is distinctly at odds with the widespread view that our aim should be to formulate models or sets of principles that can be adopted and applied by citizens-or to show that various proposed models and principles are inadequate to serve that function. The work-defining norm in Aristotle's text is opposed to this conception of the theorist as Author's Note: A version of this essay was presented at the annual meeting of the New England Political Science Association in April 2005. For insightful comments and criticisms I thank Delba Winthrop, David Roochnik, Jean Yarborough, Mary Dietz, and two anonymous reviewers for Political Theory. 29</page><page sequence="2">30 Political Theory hypothetical legislator, and he, like Plato, seems determined to make it dif ficult for his readers to appropriate his work as a direct guide to changing or maintaining the world. But Aristotle's attitude toward the role of philos ophy in political life is not merely negative. Book 7, I will argue, suggests a different positive role for philosophy or theory, less direct but perhaps in the end more significant: to call attention to the limits of contemporary political understanding, and to bring out questions and problems that the contemporary understanding tends to overlook, to its detriment. Interpreting Politics 7 Book 7 of the Politics poses several important-and usually overlooked problems for the reader. Book 7 is generally taken to be the culmination of Aristotle's political theory, in which he presents (primarily in chapters 4-12) his view of the simply best regime, the regime he describes as according to prayer (kat'euchen), the true aristocracy we would pray for if we could con trol all the factors that go into making a political community, such as the number of citizens and the extent of territory. Some readers, like Richard Kraut, see the Book 7 sketch of this city in speech as a model to guide polit ical choice, and as such the central message of the Politics. The only thing that puzzles Kraut about Book 7 is that Aristotle should put it off for so long: For there is something unsatisfactory about Aristotle's postponement of his discussion of the ideal city to the end of his treatise: he asks his audience to wait a long time before he comes to the destination for which he has been preparing them. It is in Books 7 and 8 that we find Aristotle's fullest and most detailed account of how a city is best organized.' Most readers, like Kraut, understand Aristotle's regime according to prayer as the culmination of the entire work, meant to serve as an ideal guide to practical political reform, even if not to such reform as can be undertaken in the immediate future. Jill Frank, for example, argues that the best regime of Books 7-8 indicates the outlines of a regime that exists in the present as one potential telos among several, a possible future, but one that can be actu alized only after Athens, or some other existing regime, has managed to establish the kind of political friendship that Aristotle sees as the work of a "polity," the cross between democracy and oligarchy that approximates true aristocracy. The best possible development would thus be in two stages: from Athens as it is to polity, and then from polity to what Frank calls the "city of</page><page sequence="3">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 31 prayer" envisaged in Book 7. Josiah Ober sees in the institutions of this city a blueprint for a quite different and much less attractive future, an imperialist conquest of Asia, to be led in the not too distant future by Alexander, for the sake of establishing a true aristocracy of Greek philosopher-politicians sup ported by Asian slave labor.2 But there are reasons to doubt that treating the kat'euche^n regime as a choice-guiding model is consistent with Aristotle's political science (poli tike) or philosophy as a whole, as presented in the Nicomachean Ethics (hereafter, NE) and the Politics. His use of the designation "regime accord ing to prayer" connects Aristotle's Book 7 regime to the kat'euche^n regimes he criticizes in Book 2, those of Plato3 in the Republic and the Laws, as well as the solutions to the political problem offered by Phaleas and Hippodamus and those which are suggested by Sparta, Crete, and Carthage. The Book 2 discussion of these regimes is severely critical, arguing in each case that the idealizing theorists or the intellectual partisans of actually existing cities like Sparta misleadingly believe that there are simple solu tions to the problems of politics. Aristotle shows, in effect, that these theorists and partisans have missed the point that he opens in Book 1, chapter 2, and lays out explicitly in Book 3, chapter 12: that political ques tions always require a balancing of diverse and sometimes incompatible goods, a balancing that can be accomplished only in context and not by the unmediated application of universalizing theory. Aristotle's evident opposition to utopian solutions, along with his per sistent stress on the need for contextual judgment in both the NE and the Politics, has led a few readers to reject the notion that Aristotle intends the best regime of Book 7 to serve as any sort of a model for political praxis. Mary Nichols is one: If the best regime serves as a model for other cities, it is not as the ideal of which they fall short and which they should strive to emulate. It is a model only because it reveals the limits of politics.... The conditions necessary for political rule make its full flourishing impossible.4 My own position on how to read Book 7 is closer to that of Nichols than that of Kraut or Ober or Frank. While I acknowledge at the outset that Aristotle's text can support more than one reading, I will argue that the kat'euche^n polis is not intended as a model or ideal to be followed, but as one aspiration among several to be seriously examined and consulted by political people as they deliberate concerning what must be done in particular situations. My</page><page sequence="4">32 Political Theory argument is that the prayer presented in chapters 4-12 should not be read as Aristotle's own, but as one imagined voice among the several presented by his political philosophizing in the NE and the Politics, which two volumes must be taken together as a set of lectures on politike^ addressed to future politicians. The likely agent of this prayer is a man (that is, in Aristotle's Greek, an aner, a male-or, better, a "real man"-rather than an anthr6pos, a human being) fully committed to the political life, someone for whom noth ing more beautiful can be imagined than a beautiful polis. Such a person understands human virtue quite differently from Aristotle, who, like Plato, is consistently and explicitly critical of what he sees as the powerful and mis guided Greek tendency to equate virility or manliness and virtue.5 If there is a politeia in Book 7 that Aristotle himself would pray for, it is more likely to be the clearly fictional isolated polis-hardly more than a fully actualized philosopher (or Aristotelian god) disguised as a hypothetical city-briefly mentioned in 7.2, 1324b41-1325a5: But even by itself a single polis, one governed nobly, could flourish by itself-if indeed it is possible for a polis using serious laws to be managed on its own somewhere-and the ordering of its regime would not be toward war or dominating over enemies, given its assumed isolation. Such a regime would indeed be active, but all its activity would be directed toward itself: it is not necessary that those cities be inactive that are situated apart by themselves and choose upon reflection to live that way. For action can also take place among the parts.... Otherwise, the god and the entire universe could hardly be in a noble condition, since they have no external actions beyond those that are proper to themselves. (7.3, 1325b23-30)6 This autotelic polis, barely hinted at as a possibility in 7.2 and 7.3, is quite different from the city attuned to war and commerce that Aristotle turns to as the kat'euche^n best polis in his discussion that runs from 7.4 through 7.12. My starting point for discussing Book 7 in terms of these two voices is the belief that the overall purpose of Aristotle's political thought is not to develop and defend a single coherent model to serve as the one best guide to political action and choice, but instead to describe and criticize, using the evaluative perspective supplied by his theoretical understanding of nature and human nature, a series of plausible horizons or opinions about politics and the best human life.7 What Aristotle's theory brings to politics is not a new model, but a teleological theory of the human good, one that is both</page><page sequence="5">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 33 empirical and normative, in dialogue with those models that already exist. If this is so, we can see that Book 7 contains two distinct perspectives or horizons. It is not simply a discussion of the best regime, primarily chapters 4-12, but also of the best human life and of the rank ordering of the human virtues. My claim is that the model polity of these central chapters is severely criticized by the theoretical discussion of the surrounding chapters, 1-3 and 13-15, and that this critique is at least as much a part of the lesson of the Politics as is the kat'euche^n regime itself. Book 7 begins-and it is clearly one of Aristotle's not infrequent new beginnings, if we assume the traditional order of the Books-with his assertion that the question of the best life is prior to the question of the best polis.8 The success of any polis must be measured by the extent to which it promotes and supports well-lived human lives (7.13, 1322a29-39). This has been a constant feature of the argument of the Politics since Book 1, chapter 2, which defines political life as a human invention designed to solve the problem of how best to actualize our capacity for living according to our unique capacity for logos. But what is a well-lived human life? Just as in Book 10 of the NE, Aristotle tells the readers or auditors of Book 7 that this is still an open question, in spite of the fact that he himself has provided apparently conclusive answers to it at several points in the course of both works. Unlike Book 10 of the NE, he does not explicitly insist here on the superiority of the theoretical or contemplative life to the practical, though he comes very close and it is hard not to read that opinion just beneath the surface of the text. As in NE 10, he proposes an unconventional standard for judging the quality of a human life, a standard whose meaning is wholly dependent on concepts Aristotle uses to characterize the nature of beings in his metaphysics and natural science: lives are well lived to the extent they actualize the human potentiality for living prohairetic lives, or living as "independent practical reasoners," in Maclntyre's useful gloss.9 But his manner of addressing that question in the first three chapters of Book 7 problematizes praxis or political life itself, by advancing the view that praxis (political action) itself is only one possible mode of human energeia (actual ity), and not, as it is for, among others, John Rawls, a "free-standing" way of life, one that can be understood in its own terms without any explicit refer ence to metaphysics or science. What does this theoretical subordination of praxis to energeia do practically or rhetorically in Politics 7? Two things that seem to point in opposite directions: one a lowering and the other an elevation of the status of political life. It highlights the relatively instru mental and unleisurely character of political praxis, and yet it also brings philosophy and politics closer together than the endoxa take them to be.10</page><page sequence="6">34 Political Theory This double motion, a reconciliation of the quarrel between politics and philosophy largely on philosophy's terms, is produced by the implicit dia logue between the prayer of the noble citizen in chapters 4-12 and the quite different voice of the theorist examining the relationship between political life and human virtue(s) in chapters 1-3 and 13-15. One convenient way to see the difference between these two "voices" or perspectives on politics is to examine three apparently anomalous features of the kat'euchen polis of chapters 4-12, ones that seem to clash with the understanding of the theorist who speaks to us in the rest of the text: the unremarked presence of apparently unjust slavery, the preeminence of andreia (courage or manliness) among the virtues, and the place accorded to conventional Greek religion (and the concomitant absence of genuine theoria or philosophy) in the city of prayer. How Aristotelian Is the City of Prayer? Unjust Slavery The citizens of the best regime need leisure, and therefore they need slavery-wage labor is not a viable substitute (nor is living off the land). Aristotle's implication, I think, is that there is no alternative to some form of slavery if we are to secure for the citizens of this regime both the material goods they need to live and the leisure time they need to live well. This by itself is perfectly consistent with Aristotle's more extensive discussion of slav ery in 1.3-7. In obvious and striking contrast with what he says about the best democracy in 6.4, Aristotle says (in 7.9) that farming in the kat'euchen regime must be done by slaves, presumably to provide more leisure for the would-be fully committed citizens whose prayer this regime expresses than is available to the farmers of Book 6, who care about politics and who participate in elect ing and auditing officeholders and in serving on juries (1318b; it goes without saying that they would also become soldiers when needed), none of which are negligible or passive duties, but who are unwilling, as well as unable, to devote their lives to the polis rather than to their farms and families. A working farmer's life would leave citizens too little leisure for the practices of human excellence, and wage labor makes for bad citizenship, as the personal depen dence of laborer on employer opens the way to corruption and, perhaps, leads citizens to exaggerate the (nonetheless very real) importance of money to a good life and a well-organized polis. So what is left is slavery, and slavery against nature-Book 1 having demonstrated that perfectly natural and just slavery would be extremely unproductive slavery. So a form of unnatural and</page><page sequence="7">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 35 unjust slavery must be adopted-though the injustice should be mitigated as much as possible by promising the slaves emancipation as a reward for good service (1330a).'1 What is notable here is not so much the likelihood that slav ery in this city of prayer will be unjust, but the utter absence of any consider ation of its justice. Nothing is said here, as it is in Book 1, about the extent to which slavery is a good life for those who are slaves by nature. Slavery is an economic necessity, given the ancient alternatives, but the good conscience about unjust enslavement exhibited in this polis seems dictated not by the unalterable facts of life and the existing technology, but by the necessities pre sent in the character of the citizens-by what they refuse to consider as much as by what they need to live well."2 The Elevation of Manliness over Deliberative Ability The same sort of particular psychological necessity that pushes justice to one side in the case of the practice of slavery is also at work in the law con cerning citizenship in this true aristocracy. The kat'euchen polis is compelled to assume (against reason) that all who are as young men capable of bearing arms well will be capable of exercising legal and political judgment when they are older-since "those who have authority over ta hopla (heavy arms) will also have authority over whether the regime will last or not" (7.9, 1329al 1-12). There is no explanation of why the possession of andreia (man liness) guarantees the later flowering of dikaiosune^ (justice) and epieikeia (equity or decency, the word Aristotle most frequently uses as a summary term for the quality of the good human being). Those who bear arms must be guaranteed an opportunity to serve in political office when they are older, or else they will be a threat to the regime. Again, the necessity operating here is local rather than universal-a matter of the habituated morality of this par ticular regime (and perhaps of politics everywhere, at least politics as Aristotle knows it) rather than natural inevitability. The premise of this regime is that the highest aspiration of any real man (aner) is participation in ruling, and the only reward that insures the loyalty of those who bear arms is the prospect of achieving high political office. Needless to say, this is not a conception of the best human life shared by the theory presented in the chapters of Book 7 that surround chapters 4-12. One central difference between the horizons of chapters 1-3 and chapters 13-15 on one hand and chapters 4-12 on the other is that the central chapters assert a parity between military and political life (see the end of 7.9, but compare the apparently lower rank of military prowess as compared with the ability to judge well in 7.8, 1328b), a parity explicitly denied by the chapters that bracket the city according to prayer. In the same way, the bracketing chapters are concerned</page><page sequence="8">36 Political Theory with the virtues of human beings (and the relationship between the good male and the good human being), and the central chapters with the virtues of males (or with the relationship between the good male and the good citizen) only.'3 Nevertheless, this close connection between military and political activ ity is itself a central theme of the Politics from beginning to end, and its presence in the prayer of the committed citizen comes as no surprise. The connection between military virtue (polemike arete) and political virtue (politike) or justice (dikaiosune^) as ends in themselves, rather than merely instrumental means to good politics (like wealth or free birth), is asserted at the end of 3.12, 128314-22: The dispute necessarily occurs in respect to those things which constitute a polis [or from which a polis is made]. It is reasonable that the well-bom the free and the wealthy lay claim to honor ... yet if these things are needed, so also, it is clear, are [the virtue] of justice and military virtue ... without the former parts there cannot be a polis, but without the latter the polis cannot be finely administered.'4 Elsewhere in the Politics, Aristotle asserts that there is an intimate connec tion between hopliteia (the hoplite order) and politeia (the political order), as a matter of both theoretical account and historical fact."' It is clear, however, that the wider perspective of the surrounding chapters of Book 7 sees this intimate connection between hopliteia and politeia as a dangerous and ever present tendency in all those places that take good citizenship seriously. In chapter 2, Aristotle says that "the laws and customs (ta nomima) established among most people are random heaps, so to speak, but wherever the nomoi aim at one single thing, it is at domination (to kratein)" (1324b5-7). He goes on to say that this is equally true of Greek poleis, such as Sparta and Crete, and of non-Greek nations powerful enough for pleonexia, such as the Scythians, Persians, Thracians, and Celts. Politics from this perspective loses much of its nobility and appears as little more than the sublimation of private pleonexia. Similarly, chapters 14 and 15 leave no more doubt than does NE 10 that war is sim ply an instrumental means to peace, and that the excellences connected with war are the least human of the virtues. Demotic Rather Than Philosophical Religion There is a third way the kat'euche?n regime diverges sharply from the Aristotelian perspective, and this is in its conception of the role of religion in</page><page sequence="9">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 37 politics. In this case, the tension is especially clear, since in 7.3 Aristotle reminds us of his philosophic notion of "the god" as the continuously actual ized unmoved mover that plays so central a role in his defense of the theoret ical life (and his critique of the extent to which the "actuality" of the political life is the highest level of human energeia) in NE 10. But no such god appears in chapters 4-12, where we find instead a wholly conventional picture of Greek piety, in which the gods serve to reinforce civic morality rather than serving as a way of problematizing that morality-a narrowly civil religion, presided over by the elderly ex-warriors and rulers, rather than a religious/philosophical challenge to the idealization of existing political life. By contrast, outside of these chapters, Aristotle's attitude toward con ventional religion almost always tends to deprecation, even in those works that are only glancingly concerned with first philosophy. Piety is conspicu ous in its absence from the list of the moral virtues in the NE, tragedy is rig orously desacralized in the Poetics, and the anthropomorphic Greek gods are said to be mere self-glorifying human inventions in Politics 1.2 (1252b). Aristotle lays out his view of the difference between these two aspects of religion, the part that leans toward philosophical insight and the part that is merely a myth useful for tying citizens to the regime, in Metaphysics 12.8, 1074a38-bl4: There is a tradition handed down from the distant past to later generations, that these stars are gods and that the whole of nature is divine. The rest of the tradition is a mythical accretion, added to persuade the many and to use in upholding what is lawful and advantageous; for those who handed it down say that the gods have human form or are similar to other animals, and they add other features following from these and similar to them. But if we sepa rate the first point-that they thought the primary substances were gods from these accretions, and consider it alone, we will regard it as a divine insight, on the assumption that every craft and philosophical discipline has probably often been discovered, as far as people could manage it, and has often been forgotten, and that this belief has survived like remains from ear lier generations until the present. And so [the truth of] the ancestral beliefs coming from the earliest times is evident to us only to this extent.16 Aristotle's voice in 7.3 asserts the "first point," but the city of prayer coun tenances only the mythical accretions. One illuminating contrast here might be with Plato's Laws, in which the Athenian Stranger in Book 10 constructs a very Aristotelian cosmology and theology that seem to be an attempt to fashion a more adequately philosophical civil religion. No such attempt is made in the Politics, perhaps because Aristotle could not bring himself to</page><page sequence="10">38 Political Theory believe that any such philosophically attractive civil religion could be made acceptable to the men of the kat'euche^n regime. Whatever the reason, no such connection with philosophy appears in chapters 4-12-no god of the philosophers, and no special place for philoso phy in the city of prayer. The only mention of philosophy in his account of the kat'euche^n regime in chapters 4-12 is at the end of chapter 1 1, in the dis cussion of the importance of good military defense: there are, he says, also "inventions that defenders either have made or must look for and use philos ophy to think out. For attackers do not even attempt to impose their rule on those who are well prepared" (1331al4-18).'7 This is reminiscent of Aristotle's remark in Book 1 about the surprising (to the uninitiated) instru mental utility of philosophizing as a way of acquiring wealth (Thales showed he was nobody's fool, though a philosopher, by using his meteorological skills to establish a lucrative monopoly on olive presses), something that is very useful for all poleis (1259a). This is a much lower, less constitutive use of philosophy as a means to a political end than either the suggestion in Book 2 that philosophy is the only possible cure for the souls of potential tyrants (1267a), or the claim in Book 3 that political philosophizing is needed to help us understand the sort of equality that is an essential element of all political community (1282b), or the use of music as a philosophical diagoge^ or "pas time" in Book 8. Once again, comparison with Plato's Laws helps illustrate the thinness of the kat'euche^n regime: there is no nocturnal council here, no institution charged with "judging according to nature what things come into being in a noble fashion and what things do not" (Book 12, 966b8). Administration Rather Than Deliberation One additional surprising feature of the best polis of chapters 4-12 should be mentioned, and that is the striking absence of any discussion of political life and political judgment in the kat'euche^n regime. The public life of the polis of prayer seems to be much more a matter of household management or administration (dioike^sis, 1331b8-9) rather than political judgment."8 There is nothing about the political institutions of the regime about how the citizens would engage in making new laws and changing old ones, in settling lawsuits, and in auditing the performance of officeholders. Perhaps one of the built-in limits of the kat'euche^n regime as a model is that it eliminates the permanent problems of political life, much as Socrates' cities in speech in the Republic eliminate the problem of justice by assum ing away the tension between individual interest and common good.'9 This is perhaps why Aristotle ends his explicit treatment of this model regime by</page><page sequence="11">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 39 cutting off as pointless any further talk about how the offices and public spaces of this regime should be organized: But it is pointless to spend time discussing and giving detailed accounts of such matters, for it is not hard to think them through: what is hard is to cre ate them. To speak about them is a work of prayer, but whether they come about is a work of chance. (1331bl8-22) When Aristotle turns to the problems of education in virtue in the chapters that follow, he is no longer speaking from within the horizon of the kat'euche^n regime, but from the perspective of an outsider, looking at politi cal life from the vantage point of his conception of human nature. Does this mean that Aristotle is somehow "ironic" in calling the regime of chapters 4-12 the best regime, and that he shows it to us only to encourage our rejection?20 Not necessarily; there is a third interpretive option. My conjec ture is that Aristotle's wish, and the general lesson his Politics seeks through out to convey, is for a polis whose citizens are capable of moving between the two perspectives and allowing each to interrogate the other. How Can Philosophy Inform Politics? Articulating Questions the Endoxa Hide The Politics begins dialectically, with a proposition about a hypothetical interlocutor, one whose conception of politics the rest of the work will address. That interlocutor asserts that the essence of politics is the same as the essence of monarchical rule, the essence of controlling slaves, and the essence of running a household-in each case, what counts is ruling rather than being ruled. The interlocutor is often taken to be Plato, on the basis of the resemblance between this position and one asserted by the Eleatic Stranger at the beginning of the Statesman, a proposition the Stranger soon sees as a mistake on the very Aristotelian grounds that political rule is dif ferent from the others in that it is rule over equals relative to imperfect but indispensable laws.21 The interlocutor is not Plato, however, but the endoxa, Aristotle's name for the most widespread and influential elements of reputable Greek opinion. Aristotle's response resembles that of Plato's Socrates, who in dialogue after dia logue substitutes "caring" for "ruling" as the chief political activity.22 The cen tral rhetorical and practical work of the Politics is to respond to the belief in the link between politics and power, as we might say, by asking the audience to see</page><page sequence="12">40 Political Theory political activity in a new light, the light provided by the Aristotelian under standing of nature and human nature. His goal is not to win over Platonists to his theoretical side, but to rebut and redirect his numerous and not especially philo sophical opponents, who by Book 7 he identifies as "the many" (hoi polloi): 'The many seem to believe that mastery (despotike) is political life (politike)" (1324b32-33). Who are these "many" who believe that the central business of politics should be acquiring and maintaining power? Aristotle, like Plato, frequently uses "the many" as a rhetorical scarecrow to stand for people unlike us, people with whom "we" would not be caught dead agreeing. This is espe cially effective rhetorically when he can attribute to this undesirable category many opinions that "we" presumably more refined folk bring with us to the discussion of politics. A good example of this in the NE concerns honor: in Book 1, 1095b, the belief that honor is the highest good is attributed to the refined people rather than to the many, who care only for pleasure. Later in the NE, however, Aristotle defends pleasure as an essential element of human happiness or flourishing (eudaimonia; 7.13), and identifies the love of honor with "the many" (8.8, 1 159a1 1-12); in the Politics, this love of honor is iden tified with the wealthy. What seems at first to distinguish "us" from "them" a concern with honor-turns out to be a problem we all share. The first step in his task of distancing politics from mastery in the Politics is in the discussion of slavery in Book 1, the first empirical topic he discusses, and the first application of his conception of nature to everyday life. The conclusion of this discussion is not a thumbs-up or thumbs-down judgment about the justness of slavery, but a statement that "it is clear from these things that mastery and politics (despoteia and politike?) are not the same thing nor are all kinds of ruling (archai) the same as one another, as some say" (1255bl6-18). The practical goal of Aristotle's Politics is thus to problematize political life by bringing the endoxa into conversation with the theoretical language of a nonreductionist and complex naturalistic account of human beings, an account that stresses the unique plurality of human goods and their partial incommensurability-and therefore both the centrality and the fallibility of phrone?sis and prohairesis for a well-lived human life and a well-formed politeiallaws. This project would seem to be in direct conflict with the best kat'euchen regime of Book 7-which presents itself as a final solution to the political problem of the best possible regime, rather than a problematization aiming at deepening reflection rather than directly promoting one kind of praxis rather than another. How can we explain this? Is the Book 7 polis the best of all possible poleis? In one way, yes; in another way, no. Yes-if the best polis is one composed of fully committed citizens, those who identify the</page><page sequence="13">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 41 common good with the human good simply; if the good man (aner) is iden tical with the good human being (anthropos). But no-if the best polis is composed of citizens who entertain serious doubts about the coincidence of the political good and the human good simply. In practice, each of these answers may be better at different times and in different places-depending on the circumstances and the resources of different poleis.23 What, then, is the practical point of the city according to prayer? As with the absolute monarchy (pambasileia) described at the end of Book 3, the Book 7 city serves practice and political reason by highlighting certain lim its of politics that the serious citizen should always have in view. In Book 3, those involved the limits imposed by a rule of law and by the need for a large measure of equal status in all law-governed regimes. The purpose of politics-the development of individual human virtue and happiness-can never be perfectly reconciled with essential political practices and norms, in this case the rule of law and citizen equality.24 Far from being a counsel of despair, this practical bit of advice tells us to be very careful to avoid either falling in love with utopian dreams or deifying our existing political arrangements. If there is a paradox at the heart of human politics, it is this: we need some thing authoritative (kurion) in our emotional and dianoetic lives to restrain the tendency to unlimited acquisition (pleonexia) and help develop the potential for practical reason (phronesis) and the virtues of character; but no person, no principle (or law), and no way of life can serve as a perfectly adequate and permanent authority. What saves politics on this Aristotelian view from being a tragedy is the uniquely human capacity for reshaping ourselves and our communities through articulate speech, through logos. As Aristotle's exten sive discussion in Book 5 of the Politics of the causes and ways of avoiding the destruction of all sorts of regimes indicates, we can change our political world as well. Neither biological inheritance nor deeply ingrained ethos is destiny for human beings, who "many times act against habituation and against nature on account of logos, whenever they are persuaded that being otherwise is better" (Politics 7, 1332b6-8).25 This remarkable passage on the openness of individual identity occurs just before Aristotle's final survey of the nature of the human soul, politics, and the virtues in chapters 14-15 of Book 7. The upside of this, so far as human agency is concerned, is the thought that while politics is not open to a perfect or utopian resolution, it is permanently revisable. There is also a negative reflection about the role of theory in the world of practice implicit in Aristotle's failure to supply actors with an action determining model: any theoretical formulation that is clear and precise enough to be understood as an action-guiding directive is a mistake, an</page><page sequence="14">42 Political Theory error about the plurality and partial incommensurability of human goods. The mistake we make here is not merely pedagogical (as if the only con cern were with getting auditors to learn for themselves), nor is it a failure to recognize a presumably unique human agency, but it is an empirical mis take about what being a human being is like, and as such a distortion of the world political philosophy intends to make better. Is there, then, any Aristotelian answer to the question of the best politi cal order? Is there a city that he might pray for? Aristotle tells us so much about the indispensability of political life for human flourishing that it would be absurd to conclude that he has no views at all about this question, even given his repeated stress on the need for contextual judgment and for theoretical restraint in political affairs. While the city of prayer does not supply such an answer, the philosophical critique of that city is not meant to imply that all political life is equally flawed, something to be avoided except under the pressure of the direst necessity. His own best city cannot be specified in detail, but we can at least say that it would be persistently aware of and on guard against the two mistakes most commonly made by citizens and theorists alike: treating political life as merely instrumental, and treating citizenship as the peak of human activity. Notes 1. Richard Kraut, Aristotle: Political Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 190. Kraut goes on to speculate that the reason the ending of Book 3 corresponds so closely to the beginning of Book 7 is that the end of Book 3 was written by a scribe or editor prepar ing an abridged version of the Politics for those lacking the time or inclination to slog through the largely negative material, as Kraut understands it, presented in Books 4-6. 2. Jill Frank, A Democracy of Distinction: Aristotle and the Work of Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), ch. 5; and Josiah Ober, Political Dissent in Democratic Athens (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998), ch. 6. Frank assimilates the prayer regime to the middle-class "aristocratic" democracy of Book 4. But she accomplishes this by leaving out critical consideration of the particular institutions of the kat'euch?n regime. I strongly agree with her, contra Ober, that the "democracy of distinction" Aristotle sketches in Book 4 is the appropriate goal or model of political activity, and that, for Aristotle, such a regime is valu able and according to nature because it promotes in various ways lives that are prohairetic rather than pleonectic. But, as I will try to show in what follows, I do not think the Book 7 prayer regime serves this function at all. 3. Note Plato's Socrates' use of "prayer" in the Republic. See Kraut, Aristotle, 192 n. 1, who remarks that Socrates says he hopes his beautiful city in speech, his Kallipolis, is not a mere "prayer," but a possibility, a useful model. For example, at the end of Book 7 (540dl-3): "the things we have said about the city and the regime are not in every way prayers . . . they are hard but in a way possible" (this is Allan Bloom's translation, from his The Republic of Plato, 2nd ed. [New York: Basic Books, 1991]). Aristotle, by contrast, says that the best polis</page><page sequence="15">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 43 of Book 7 is a prayer, though it cannot be something impossible. My guess is that Plato's city is meant to serve as a sort of model that can be actualized in practice, though for adult moral self-education rather than political change (I think the end of Republic 9 is conclusive on this), whereas Aristotle's kat'euch?n regime is not. It is more like a hope or dream than an accurate theory. The question is, whose dream is it? In On Interpretation (16b33-17a4), Aristotle defines euch? or prayer as a logos that is neither true nor false?a significant and meaningful logos, but not one that has truth-value, and so not a part of any scientific demonstration. The NE and the Politics, we should bear in mind, are meant to be scientific works, albeit practical or action-oriented science rather than science that aims at no activity beyond itself. 4. Mary Nichols, Citizens and Statesmen: A Study of Aristotle's Politics (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992), 164-65, and ch. 4 generally. 5.1 argue for this interpretation of Plato and Aristotle as critics of the Greek attitude toward virility (andreia?frequently rendered "courage," but better translated as virility or manliness since it is the adjective formed from an?r, male) in Stephen Salkever, Finding the Mean: Theory and Practice in Aristotelian Political Philosophy (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1990), ch. 4, "Gendered Virtue: Plato and Aristotle on the Politics of Virility." 6. Translations from the Politics are based on those of Aristotle: The Politics, trans, with an intro., notes, and glossary by Carnes Lord (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984); and The Politics of Aristotle, trans, with an intro, analysis, and notes by Peter L. Phillips Simpson (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997); and translations from the Nicomachean Ethics are based on Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd ed., trans, with an intro, notes, and glossary Terence Irwin (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hackett, 1999). 7.1 have sketched the general features of such an approach to these two works in Stephen Salkever, "Aristotle and the Ethics of Natural Questions," in Instilling Ethics, ed. Norma Thompson (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000), 3-16; and Stephen Salkever, "The Deliberative Model of Democracy and Aristotle's Ethics of Natural Questions," in Aristotle and Modern Politics: The Persistence of Political Philosophy, ed. Aristide Tessitore (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 2002), 342-74. A similar approach is engagingly applied to the NE in Thomas W. Smith's Revaluing Ethics: Aristotle's Dialectical Pedagogy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001). 8. The opening line of Book 7 is a new beginning only on the assumption that our current Book 7 is meant to follow Book 6, rather than Book 3?if the latter is true, then the beginning of 7 flows smoothly from the end of 3. So long as the only way of resolving the question of the order of the books of the Politics is an interpretive judgment about which order is more coher ent, I prefer our current order, on the premise that discontinuities and new beginnings are a cen tral feature of many Aristotelian texts. Viewed in the context of his educational goals, these discontinuities add to the text's coherence rather than detract from it. Carnes Lord (15-17) dis agrees, and provides an excellent guide to the question of the order of the books. Where you place the traditional Books 7 and 8 depends on whether you think Aristotle would be willing to defer the question of the best life and his "regime according to prayer" until after his discussion, in Books 4-6 as traditionally numbered, of practicable regimes, ones that are possible, for better and worse, under the circumstances Aristotle sees around him. I think it makes good sense for him to do just that; Simpson disagrees. I would frame the issue thus: if you believe that Aristotle wants to use his discussion of the best life as a ground from which to deduce political principles, then what have been called Books 7 and 8 should then indeed be placed as Books 4 and 5; but if you think as I do that Aristotle wants to teach his students to ask the question of the best life rather than to present them with a doctrine of it, then it makes better sense to leave the books as they are. Much also depends on whether you think that the regime according to prayer is meant</page><page sequence="16">44 Political Theory to serve as a model for practical reform (with Simpson) or a warning against treating politics as the final and perfect human horizon. I think it is such a warning, and not a simple one. Instead, Aristotle uses the regime according to prayer as a point of departure for his final discussion of human virtue and human nature, and for his discussion of education in Book 8?an education Simpson misleadingly refers to as "education in the best regime." Book 8 is a reflection on the complex structure and function of paideia, and not a pedagogical scheme for any regime, whether in fact or in speech. For brief discussion of the discontinuities in the NE and the Politics and some pedagogical and rhetorical justifications for these breaks, see Stephen Salkever, "Aristotle and the Ethics of Natural Questions," in Instilling Ethics, ed. Norma Thompson (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000), 3-16. 9. Alasdair Maclntyre, Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (Chicago: Open Court, 1999). 10. Ronna Burger argues persuasively and ingeniously that NE 10 plays down the possible tensions between the theoretical life and the political life, even as it ranks the former above the latter. See Ronna Burger, "Aristotle's 'Exclusive' Account of Happiness: Contemplative Wisdom as a Guise of the Political Philosopher," in The Crossroads of Norm and Nature: Essays on Aristotle's Ethics and Metaphysics, ed. May Sim (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995), 79-98.1 think something similar occurs in Politics 1. 11. For an argument that there is no inconsistency between Aristotle's account of natural slavery in Book 1 and his suggestion that slaves in the kat'euchen regime should be given the prospect of freedom, see Kraut, Aristotle, 297-98. 12. By contrast, there is no slavery at all in Plato's Kallipolis. According to Socrates in the Republic, slavery enters the picture only after the best city has declined into timocracy, a regime like that of Sparta, halfway between aristocracy and oligarchy, whose rulers institute private prop erty and are largely concerned with war and the love of victory. At this point, the timocratic rulers "make slaves and perioikoi [serfs who dwell around the polis] those whom they had formerly guarded as free friends and nurturers" (547c 1-2). 13. See 7.15, 1334all-16: Since the telos is evidently the same for human beings (anthr?poi) both in common and privately, and there must necessarily be the same defining principle (hows) for the best an?r and the best politeia, it is evident that the virtues directed to leisure should be present; for, as has been said repeatedly, peace is the end of war, and leisure of occupation. He goes on in this passage to stress the priority of the virtue of philosophy as pertaining to leisure, justice and moderation as belonging to both but especially necessary in times of leisure, and manliness as belonging along with endurance (see NE 1) to the lower?more instrumental and less constitutive?realms of "occupation" and war. 14. See also 4.4, 1291a24-28: If then, one were to regard souls as more a part of an animal than body, things of this sort?the military element (to polemikon) and the element sharing in justice as relates to adjudication, and the deliberative element, which is the work of political understanding?must be held to be more a part of cities than things relating to nec essary needs. 15. See Book 2, 1265b26-29 (speaking of the best regime in Plato's Laws, he says, "The organization as a whole is intended to be neither democracy nor oligarchy, but a mean between</page><page sequence="17">Salkever / Whose Prayer? 45 these, which they call a polity, because it is composed of those who are hoplites"), and Book 3, 1279a36-b4. For discussion of the historical connection between the emergence of hoplite war fare and the emergence of the polis in ancient Greece, see J-P. Vernant, The Origins of Greek Thought (Ithaca, N.Y: Cornell University Press, 1984), ch. 4. 16. Translation by Terence Irwin and Gail Fine, from their Aristotle: Selections (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hackett, 1995), 341-42. 17. Carnes Lord's footnote to this passage highlights Aristotle's willingness to recommend applied philosophy as a necessary response to advances in military technology: "Catapults, battering rams, and movable towers were introduced into Greek warfare by the Carthaginians in the course of their struggle with Dionysus I of Syracuse; Philip of Maced?n used them extensively" (Aristotle, trans. Lord, 267 n. 46). In his translation of the passage, Lord, usually so carefully "literal," translates the verb philosophein at 1331al6 by the pallid "investigate," though in a footnote to the passage he calls attention to Aristotle's Greek. 18. It is not surprising that Martha Nussbaum takes most of her "Aristotelian" public pol icy goals from the kat'euch?n regime of Book 7; and it is also not surprising that Nussbaum subsequently concludes that her "capabilities" approach to politics has much more in common with John Rawls's top-down Neo-Kantianism than with Aristotle's nondeterministic natural ism. See Martha Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," in Tessitore, Aristotle and Modern Politics, 47-104. Amartya Sen's more open-ended version of the capabilities approach is thus more Aristotelian than Nussbaum's. See Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom (New York: Knopf, 1999). 19.1 have in mind here the analogy Socrates offers (Republic 2, 368e-369a) as a method ological basis for discovering the meaning of justice, saying that an individual is to a polis as a small letter is to a large letter in Book 2. If the polis is only a large individual, the problem of individual differences, the problem that gives rise to the need for justice, vanishes. 20. Commenting on the surprising presence of unjust slavery in the regime according to prayer, Mary Nichols says that this shows that "the Book 7 regime is less an ideal model for politics than a lesson in its imperfection. Aristotle's designation of that regime as the 'best' is surely ironic" (Nichols, Citizens and Statesmen, 145). 21. On the Aristotelian character of the Statesman, see especially Paul Stern, "The Rule of Wisdom and the Rule of Law in Plato's Statesman" American Political Science Review 91 (1997): 264-76. 22. For relevant citations and discussion, see Stephen Salkever, "Socrates' Aspasian Oration: The Play of Philosophy and Politics in Plato's Menexenus," American Political Science Review 87 (1993): 133-43. 23. By contrast, Plato's Socrates in Republic 7 (520b) argues that the best rule in politics is always the rule of those who are unwilling to rule because they know a better bios (way of life) than the political one. 24. The problem of citizenship, law, and the best life in Aristotle is the central topic of Susan D. Collins, Aristotle and the Rediscovery of Citizenship (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006). While I differ with the details of some of her conclusions about Politics 7 and 8,1 have learned a great deal about Aristotle's understanding of the relationship between philosophy and politics from her arguments. 25. This passage needs to be set alongside the more often quoted passage on the importance of the habituation we receive as children: "It is not unimportant, then, to acquire one sort of habit or another, right from our youth. On the contrary, it is very important, indeed all-important" (NE 2, 1103b23-25). Given the preliminary context of that remark, which occurs well before any</page><page sequence="18">46 Political Theory extended discussion of either virtue or phronesis, it cannot be taken simply as a statement of Aristotle's belief in the impossibility of altering the habits we acquire in childhood, no matter how foolish these habits seem to us when we are adults. On the meaning of the Politics 1 pas sage, see Frank, A Democracy of Distinction, which points out that such openness is already pre figured in the NE in the discussion of responsibility in Book 3. Our habituated character, our ethos, is a firm personality without which we have no human identity, but it is always subject to change, for the better and for the worse. The truly human life is prohairetic (Politics 3.9, 1280a; NE 6.2, 1139b), not merely "ethical," but such a life can be one of vices as well as virtues.
