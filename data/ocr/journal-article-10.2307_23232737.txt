<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Ecorche' drawings by Edwin Landseer by SUSAN OWENS although most often characterised as a master of sentimental anthropomorphism, Edwin Landseer built his career upon a rigor ous and unflinching study of anatomical specimens. His ecorche drawings, made between 1817 and 1821, record the process of dissection, observation and analysis through which he acquired the profound understanding of animal anatomy that underpinned his phenomenal success. As only a handful of these studies had been published before most appeared on the market in July 2010, a list of all known ecorche drawings by or attributed to Landseer is includ ed in the Appendix to this article. Eight of these have recently been acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.1 Landseer's juvenile sketches provide ample evidence that drawing dogs, horses, cows and other animals was an absorbing childhood pursuit, and reveal his precocious sensitivity to char acteristic animal behaviour.2 So when at around the age of fifteen he began to draw from ecorche specimens and carry out dis sections, he was developing a burgeoning childhood interest. This progression to scientific study was instigated by Benjamin Robert Haydon who, at their father's request, had begun to tutor Edwin's elder brothers Thomas and Charles in 1815.3 Haydon claimed that his 'school' offered 'a better and more regular system of instruction than ever the Royal Academy afforded', an assertion largely based on the anatomical study that formed the foundation of his curriculum.4 The practical com ponent of Hay don's course, conducted through private classes in anatomy offered by a surgeon, was nothing if not thorough. One contemporary account records that '[William] Bewick [another of Haydon's students] and Thomas and Charles Landseer have been concluding their preparatory studies as far as concerns dissection. Three weeks they have been hanging over a putrid carcass, dissecting and drawing for twelve and fifteen hours a day at a time of the year when surgeons generally give up. They have made some capital drawings, examined every muscle, from its origin to its insertion, even to the very bones .. .'.s The surviving corpus of around eighty-five anatomical drawings and a sketch book made by Charles Landseer under Haydon's tutelage speaks for the dedicated and sustained nature of his studies.6 34- Study of an ecorche greyhound, lateral view, by Edwin Landseer. c. 1817-21.

Although there is no evidence that Edwin attended Haydon's 'school' to the extent of his elder brothers, throughout 1815 and 1816 he apparently had weekly consultations with Haydon.7 Wishing to impress the importance of a thorough understand ing of anatomy on his young student, by way of introduction to the subject Haydon lent Edwin drawings, books and prints from which to study, noting in his diary on 5th April 1815: 'Lent young Landseer my Anatomical Drawings, John Bell on the Bones, Anatomy of a Lion, Plates, etc.'.8 This generous loan covered a lot of ground. Haydon's 'Anatomical Drawings', made between 1803 and 1806 and mounted together in an album for the use of his students, were the results of his own early research. The drawings included copies from the English edition of Albinus' Tables of the Skeleton and Muscles of the Human Body (1749) and from anatomical drawings by Leonardo da Vinci which Haydon had seen reproduced in John Chamber laine's Imitations of Original Designs by Leonardo da Vinci with etchings by Bartolozzi (1796); numerous studies of human bones and dried muscle samples; and drawings which Haydon had made directly from dissections.9 'John Bell on the Bones' refers to Bell's surgical treatise Anatomy of the Bones, Muscles, and foints (1793), and presumably also to the accompanying volume of illustrations which Bell published the following year, Engrav ings, Explaining the Anatomy of the Bones, Muscles and Joints (1794). Haydon admired Bell's treatise for its 'admirable per spicuity' and described how he made it 'the textbook of my school'.10 'Anatomy of a Lion' refers to drawings which Haydon made in the course of dissecting a lioness in 1810 at the school of anatomy run by Charles Bell, brother of John Bell, while he was still a student." Even discounting the additional 'Plates, etc.', this material would have introduced Landseer not only to a wide range of human and animal anatomy, but also to a variety of representational methods, from Haydon's bold, almost diagrammatic drawings to John Bell's complex and macabre scenes of dissections in progress. Haydon's next suggestion to Landseer was practical study, as he later recalled: 'I advised him [Edwin] to dissect animals — the only mode of acquiring their construction — as I had dissected men, and as I should make his brothers do'.12 In later years Haydon claimed that his advice had been salutary, inscribing in his album (now in the Royal Academy of Arts, London): 'Edwin Landseer copied my dissection of the Lioness which sent him to other animals to dissect &amp; certainly was the basis of a power of drawing which enabled him to devellope fii'c] his Genius to its full extent'.13 Landseer was apparently in agreement, as W.P. Frith recalled: 'I have often heard Edwin say that he owed no litde of his success to Haydon's insisting upon dissection of animals as a vital element in the practice of an animal painter . . As a student himself, Haydon had attended lectures and demonstrations on anatomy given by the Scottish surgeon Charles Bell at his premises on Leicester Street in Soho. Like Haydon, Bell was a significant figure at the interface of art and science. He gave lectures tailored to the needs of art students, thus filling a significant gap in the teaching of anatomy offered by the Royal Academy, which at this time was superficial (Bell's candidature in 1808 for the post of Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy had not been successful).15 In a letter of 1806 Bell related how he had just given his 'painters' 'a general view of the system of a limb, bone, muscle, tendon, of arteries and veins' and remarked that 'they stand with open mouth, seeming greatly delighted'.16 At least some of Landseer's ecorche drawings would probably have been made in Bell's anatomy room or that of one of the other surgeons who offered demonstrations and classes in 7 W.

A drawing by Thomas Landseer in the V. &amp; A. of an ecorche dog's head, dated 1816, is inscribed 'Bell's / Study from Nature of a Dead . . suggesting that he made the drawing during a demonstration at Bell's school.17 Anatomical schools must have relied to a significant degree on comparative anatomy, as at this time human corpses were notoriously hard to procure; Bell probably acquired most of his human subjects illegally, for, until the Anatomy Act of 1832, the only legal source, executed criminals, was completely inadequate to supply the numerous schools of anatomy in London.18 Outside the context of the teaching offered by Haydon and Bell there is plenty of published anecdotal evidence to show that at this time Landseer conducted his own research into animal anatomy, dissecting whatever specimens he could acquire, so it is probable that some of these drawings were made in less super vised circumstances. The young Landseer was a regular visitor to the Exeter' Change Menagerie (run by Stephen Polito from 181 o to 1814 when it was taken over by Edward Cross), which was housed in a commercial building on the Strand in central London. The principal exhibits were housed on the first floor; an account of 1812 records closely packed cages housing two tigers, a Hon, a hyena, a leopard, a panther, two sloths, a camel, num erous monkeys and a tapir.19 Inscriptions on a number of Landseer's juvenile sketches of animals record that they were made at the menagerie, for example 'Senegal Lion; from Exeter 'Change - in 1811 / drawn by Edwin Landseer, aged nine years' and 'The Head of a Bengal Tigress / from Exeter Change, by Edn Landseer AE 9'.20 A later account records how Edward 15 W.

Black, red and white chalk and graphite on buff-coloured paper, 37.5 by 53.4 cm. (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). Cross, having seen the young Landseer and his friend Thomas Christmas drawing one of the lions, presented them with the carcass on its death, 'which they removed to their studio, and again studied as long as possible. The skin was afterwards pre served and stuffed. They then dissected the body. The skeleton was articulated, and set up, and formed the object of future drawing and study'.21 This is corroborated by Thomas Landseer, who recorded in 1823 that Edwin and Christmas had 'the post obit reversion' of the Hon.22 The drawings are untraced. Other sources record animal dissections made by Landseer and his friendjohn Frederick Lewis. The latter's nephew John Hard wicke Lewis recalled that the two 'were great chums as students, and used to buy carcases of foxes, game etc., and take them home for dissection and study, keeping them under their beds in daytime, which was never discovered'.23 In their A Century of British Painters, Richard and Samuel Redgrave include another anecdote about amateur Hon dissection: 'Lewis used to accom pany Landseer to the menagerie of Exeter Change to sketch the Hons which were at that time kept there; and when one of these animals happened to die, he and Landseer bought it, and preserved it so long for purposes of drawing and dissection that at last their neighbours, whose artistic sense was less developed perhaps than their olfactory one, were forced to complain'.2+ Despite accounts of such exotica, Landseer's surviving ecorche studies are, somewhat more prosaically, of dogs, wild cats (prob ably servals, presumably acquired from the menagerie) and the head of a horse. The canine specimens all appear to be a kind of sighthound, probably a greyhound, a breed used for hunting and sport.25 This suggests that Landseer's specimens could have been procured from a pack of working dogs, which would naturally have been a more likely source than family pets. Greyhounds and wild cats both have highly developed musculature, making them ideal exemplars on the dissecting table. 44- Drawing of a wolfs head, by John Frederick Lewis, c. 1821—22. Black, red and white chalk on brown paper, 33.7 by 27.2 cm. (British Museum, London). It is clear that the educational context within which Landseer made drawings of ecorche specimens was not only encouraging but all-encompassing, coming from the various directions of his mentor Haydon, who was a powerful influence in his uncompromising insistence on direct experience of dissection; from his father, who so approved of Haydon and his methods that he had sent his elder sons to be tutored by him; from his brothers; and from his contemporaries Christmas and Lewis. However, despite his immersion in anatomical study, Land seer's primary interest in animal anatomy put him at a con siderable disadvantage in comparison with Haydon's other students. While Haydon insisted on dissection as the only way of acquiring first-hand knowledge, this research was understood to take place within the context of an established literature on human anatomy. Moreover, by the 1810s numerous specialist publications were available which offered anatomical illustra tions of the human body tailored to the use of artists, aimed at the flourishing student market.26 With the notable exception of George Stubbs's The Anatomy of the Horse (1766), no such published sources existed for the student wishing to investigate animal myology (the branch of anatomy concerned with muscles).

The first treatise on canine anatomy — and 'the first compre hensive and original treatise on a vertebrate since the publication of Ruini's volume on the horse in 1598'27 — had been published in Amsterdam in 1673 by Gerard Blaes (Gerardus Blasius) in Mis cellanea Anatomica, hominis, brutorumque variorum, fabricam diversam magna parte exhibentia. However, the illustrations in this, and in an expanded work of 1681, Anatome Animalium, are devoted to internal organs, and the superficial muscular structure is not represented at all. Georges Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon, in his multi-volume Histoire naturelle, generate et particuliere, which began to appear in 1749, includes a lengthy chapter on dogs and another on cats, but the illustrative sequence segues from live animal to skeleton, then on to internal organs, without including an intermediary myological stage. John Hunter's Observations on Certain Parts of the Animal Oeconomy (2nd ed., 1792) similarly omits myology. The first works to include illustrations of musculature began to be published in the years following Land seer's ecorche studies. The publication with the most comparable myological studies of dogs and cats is Georges Cuvier's Anatomie comparee: recueil de planches de myologie, which, although the draw ings were made before 1832, was not published until 1850. In this treatise, lithographed double-page spreads show the anatomy of the dog, among numerous other animals, in successive stages, from the immediately subcutaneous muscle layer inwards. The lack of attention which had been given to the muscular structure of animals in scientific literature up to that point is referred to in the prospectus to Cuvier's Anatomie comparee: 'le grand appareil de muscles qui enveloppe de toutes partes le squelette et en fait mouvoir les diverse pieces selon la destination de chaque animal est loin d'avoir donne lieu h des publications aussi nombreuses',2S The paucity of scientific literature in the early part of the nine teenth century meant that for the student wishing to investigate 25 I am grateful to Luisa Pontello of the Kennel Club for identifying the breed of dog. 26 See M.

Landseer's drawings of ecorche animals record, therefore, more than the desire for first-hand corroborative experience; they chart the pursuit of primary knowledge which was unobtainable by any other means. As noted above, the one direcdy relevant source for Landseer of published images of animal myology was George Stubbs's The Anatomy of the Horse. A precise pencil copy of the key figure to plate IV of the Anatomy, a diagrammatic representation of the venous system of the horse, was among the ecorche animal studies 49- Study of an ecorche greyhound's head, by Edwin Landseer. c. 1817—21.

(Victoria and Albert Museum, London). offered for sale in 2010, and was presumably made around the same time, suggesting that Landseer was studying the published Anatomy while he was working on his own ecorche drawings. Landseer's interest was such that he acquired all Stubbs's original drawings for the Anatomy, although when he did so has never been established.29 According to a letter written many years later by his friend A.H. Cross, Landseer acquired them reputedly in exchange for a painting from the print dealer Paul Colnaghi (who had bought them in March 1817). Cross's letter reads: 'my friend Landseer possesses them [the drawings] [...] old Colnaghi bought them at a sale some years back when a sale of Stubbs's things took place and Landseer painted him Colnaghi a picture for them'.30 Cross's manner of expression here suggests a continuous sequence of events. Moreover, Landseer's recourse to an exchange rather than a purchase is consistent with the slender financial means of a youth, however precocious. The implication is that the Stubbs drawings were acquired by Land seer at this pivotal moment. Stylistically, Landseer's delicate and meticulous representation of musculature, the long chalk strokes and subtle use of shading and highlights to express texture, reveal the powerful influence of Stubbs, whether gleaned from his original drawings or extra polated from the engravings of the published Anatomy. In comparison with Landseer's anatomical drawings, those of Haydon and Charles Landseer — his more immediate models - seem heavy and emphatic (although Haydon was critical of Stubbs's style, remarking in 1826 that his drawings of horses are 'delicate, minute and sweetly drawn, with great character, but they want substance').31 Although Landseer's drawings were evidently made from specimens posed flat rather than suspended in a standing position, the lateral views of a greyhound (Figs.34 and 3 5) are comparable with Stubbs's pencil study for the second 29 The records kept at Colnaghi's, London, do not cover the transaction. 30 Quoted in J.

Landseer's drawings share with Stubbs's a remarkable sensitivity, investing the ecorche specimens with 'character' in a way that distinguishes them from Haydon's more utilitarian works. In one way the absence of the kind of conventional icon ography which had shaped earlier depictions of equine anatomy was liberating; Landseer's other anatomical drawings depart in inventive ways from the lateral view.32 One of the most striking of the group depicts an ecorche dog propped up with planks of wood to reveal its chest and shoulders from the front (Fig. 3 6). The gruesome nature of this drawing is shared by two studies of heads, from an equine specimen (Fig. 3 9; the only ecorche Landseer executed in watercolour) and a canine one (Fig. 40), neither of which flinch from representing sagging flesh. A key source here was Bell's Engravings, Explaining the Anatomy of the Bones, Muscles and foints. Bell felt strongly that anatomical illus trations should be representative of what would be seen in the course of an actual dissection, not coloured by 'the imagination of the painter', and he criticised what he saw as the 'subjection of true anatomical drawing to the capricious interference of the artist, whose rule it has too often been to make all beautiful and smooth, leaving no harshness'.33 As a result, Bell's illustrations are disturbingly reahstic. The corpses have ragged edges of cut flesh and are draped on the dissecting table in awkward and graceless attitudes, together with the apparatus used to position them as required (Fig. 3 7). In contrast to these unglamorous studies, another drawing shows the head, shoulders and front leg of an ecorche wild cat in a dramatic pose, as if alive, with no supporting armature (Fig.43). A similar quality is found in a small group of drawings of c.1821—22 byJ.F. Lewis ofa snarling wolfs head (Fig.44).34 The anecdotal evidence of Landseer's and Lewis's joint forays into animal dissection suggests that these drawings were made about the same time, with the intention to place specimens in poses useful for future compositions. Landseer seems to have drawn upon this anatomical study for his painting The cat's paw (exhib ited under that title at the British Institution, London, in 1824; no. 185). As Richard Ormond has pointed out, the position of the lower dog in Fighting dogs getting wind (exhibited under that title at the Society of Painters in Oil and Watercolours in 1818; no. 140) also appears to derive from Landseer's ecorche studies.35 Landseer followed Haydon most closely in his equine drawings. Edwin's study of a horse's head viewed from the side (Fig.41) corresponds closely to Haydon's drawing of 1806 (Fig.42), which was also the model for a drawing by Charles Landseer in the Wellcome Collection, London.'6 The greater degree of detail and animation in Edwin Landseer's study suggest that, although he probably referred to Haydon's drawing, he was also working from a specimen. Landseer's two haunting draw ings of a horse's head from the front (Figs.45 and 46) correspond to another by Haydon.37 Fig.46 shares Haydon's foreshortened perspective and appears to loom out of the sheet. Haydon prob ably encouraged Landseer to study the horse in particular because of its importance for history painting, which he passionately championed.38 The question arises of the purpose of this group of Landseer's drawings. Were they solely self-educative exercises, or could some have been intended for publication? Some of the studies have the feel of working drawings, such as those which focus on isolated parts: the anatomy of a paw (Fig.47) and the muscular structure of dogs' legs (Figs.48 and 51). Fig.47 in particular is drawn with considerable force and immediacy, the contours and shaded areas so heavily worked in graphite that the pressure has caused indentations in the paper. However, others display a degree of finish far beyond that required for merely investigative studies, and are set on the page with a confident sense of 35 Ormond, op. tit.

As Landseer's father, John, was a publisher and his brother Thomas a printmaker, the means were at hand to publish them. A precisely contemporary collaboration was Hay don's Drawing Book, with seven plates drawn by Haydon and etched by Thomas Landseer, published by John Landseer, first advertised in 1817.39 The family also collaborated over the publication in 1823 of Thomas's Twenty Engravings of Lions, Tigers, Panthers and Leopards. In his introduction to the work, John Landseer, never unduly reticent when opportunities arose to promote his talented offspring, praised Edwin for having gone 'directly to the living animals' to conduct first-hand studies.40 John Landseer may have sensed the opportunity to publish Edwin's ecorche studies in the tradition pioneered by Stubbs; however, the doubtful sales prospects of such a work may have discouraged him from carrying this out. No British artist since Stubbs had demonstrated comparable, albeit paradoxical, liveliness in ecorche drawings. What distinguish es Edwin Landseer's from those of his contemporaries, especially Haydon and his brothers Charles and Thomas, is his ability to express muscular structure within the context of a putative living creature. These studies have an additional dimension, as though the live animal is imaginatively superimposed upon the skinned specimen. This combination of scientific accuracy with com pelling expression of inner life and individual character was pre cisely what brought him such great success in his subsequent career as an animal painter. Most remarkable of all is Landseer's preco cious mastery of a subject then so litde known to art or science. Appendix List of all known 'ecorche' drawings by or attributed to Edwin Landseer. The drawings are all on buff-coloured, brown or grey wove wrapping papers, a cheap, readily available paper which offered a resilient drawing surface.41 The edges are generally crumpled and torn, which would suggest that they were kept for a lengthy period of time in a portfolio. This may reflect not only Landseer's own treatment of them, but that of their next owner, the amateur artist Charles Mansel Lewis, an associate of Hubert von Herkomer, who acquired most if not all in 1874.42 Four of the drawings are dated, two 1817 and two 1821. The other nine are undated but can be divided into plausible groups around the dated works. The order in which they appear below proposes that numbers 1 to 10 might date from c.1817 and numbers 11 to 14 from c.i 821; however, all undated works are here described as c.1817—21. 1.
