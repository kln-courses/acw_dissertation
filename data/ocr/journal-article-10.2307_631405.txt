<plain_text><page sequence="1">LERNER (M.-P.) La notion de finalite chez Aristote. (Publ. fac. lettres et sciences hum- aines, Paris, serie 'Recherches', 47.) Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. I969. Pp. 214. Fr. 35. M. Lerner's aim is both to explain and defend Aristotle's conception of teleology as it appears in the different branches of his philosophy. He does both very well although the method that he uses to achieve his aims is not above reproach. Very little of the book is given over to a positive and systematic assessment of Aristotle's teleology. Instead, after a short section which discusses briefly earlier attitudes towards teleology and then provides an exegesis of some of Aristotle's terminology, the bulk of the book is devoted to commentary on certain select passages from Aristotle's works. Each passage is given in a French translation and is meant to illustrate Aris- totle's invocation of teleology in a particular branch of knowledge-in his theory of science, in the sciences of nature, in theology and in ethics. The choice of these passages is to some extent arbitrary, and although the commentary provides considerable discussion round the issues raised, one has the sense of points being made and ticked off-points that will be use- ful in the final but comparatively brief assessment and defence of Aristotle. It might have been more useful to offer a great many more examples of Aristotle's use of teleology, especially perhaps in biology, so that the reader can form a judgment of how well it works. As it is the discussion concentrates more on Aristo- telian theory than on Aristotelian practice. This point might not perhaps have had the import- ance that it has if it were not for the fact that the concluding section offers something of a defence of the notion of immanent teleology. Emphasis is laid on, among other things, the fact that the Aristotelian conception is that of nature actually working to- wards an end; it is not merely that natural processes can be viewed aesthetically from this point of view. M. Lerner seems to me quite right in this and he is equally right in rejecting the criticisms that this in- volves an anthropomorphism. But if the notion is to be really intelligible, let alone defended, it is surely necessary to consider a range of examples where, on Aristotle's view, teleology is working. M. Lerner does spend some time on a discussion of Aristotle's arguments against the mechanist at Physics I98b Io ff., but such passages as he considers from biological works-De Part. An. 639bI I ff., and De An. 4I5aI4 if., and 434a31 ff.-are relatively detached from concrete phenomena. Nevertheless, within the limits that I have pointed out M. Lerner's discussion is generally both interest- ing and well argued. He is particularly good on the</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS i87 notion that art imitates nature and on the implica- tions of this idea for natural teleology, and, as I have already said, his summary and assessment of the Aristotelian conception of teleology in the concluding section has much to recommend it. He seems to me weakest on Aristotle's theology and on the question how Aristotle's God explains the movement of the heavenly spheres any better than the fifth element of the De Caelo. This he associates with the question whether immanent teleology goes together with an immanent cause of the finality in question. M. Lerner recognises developments in Aristotle's thought between the De Caelo and Metaphysics A., but it is not ,clear that he fully appreciates the reasons for these developments.. They are surely connected with Aristotle's emphasis on the distinction between actuality and potentiality, his connexion of the latter with matter, and the conception of change which is expressed in terms of the distinction. Once given all this it was surely impossible for Aristotle to be content with the view that the movement of the heavenly spheres could be explained by reference to a special form of matter. The final book of the Physics makes clear the necessity on his view for a prime mover and the nature that this must have. I do not mean by this to suggest that the argument of that book is valid, impressive though it is in its grandeur. But it makes clear what is also really evident in Metaphysics A that for Aristotle God exists as a metaphysical prin- ciple primarily, that the only way in which God affords an explanation of the movement of the heaven- ly spheres is teleologically, and that that teleology cannot be merely immanent in consequence. If this does not fit in with much of Aristotle's other uses of teleology it is nevertheless a necessity of his general metaphysical position. I do not think that M. Lerner gives full recognition to this point. I also think incidentally that he makes very heavy weather of the distinction between different senses of oi EgveKa' that Aristotle makes at e.g. De An. 415b2 ff. and Met. Io072b2 ff. Despite my criticisms there is much of interest in this book and it may well prove a useful one. D. W. HAMLYN Birkbeck College, University of London</page></plain_text>
