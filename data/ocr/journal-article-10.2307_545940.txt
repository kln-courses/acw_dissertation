DM 35 Mit sieben Siegeln versehen: Das Siegel in Wirtschaft und Kunst des alten Orients. Edited by EVELYN KLENGEL-BRANDT. Berlin: Staat- liche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum; Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1997. Pp. xii + 163 + 168 figs. + 33 pls. DM 68. These two books on ancient Near Eastern seals are published by the Vorderasiatisches Museum of Berlin in collaboration with Philipp von Za- bern, renowned for its high-quality art books. The first book presents a new and enhanced edition of the 1975 catalogue of the 482 Near Eastern stamp seals in the collection of the Vor- derasiatisches Museum, which has long been out of print. The reproductions of the seals are of better quality than in the first edition, and they are now set opposite the catalogue text. In addi- tion, a selection of 30 seal images is reproduced in an enlarged scale on seven plates, and the frontispiece shows a color image of eleven seals giving a glimpse of the variety of shapes and the aesthetic qualities of the stones from which they are made. While the catalogue text by Liane Jakob-Rost is basically unchanged, a new intro- duction by Iris Gerlach summarizes the present state of the art in the study of Near Eastern stamp seals with up-to-date literature. The in- dexes include a general index and a concordance of museum and excavation numbers. Gerlach's introduction outlines the origins and development of stamp seals in the Near East, provides a brief history of research, examines materials and shapes as well as the techniques of production, and illustrates the various uses of the seals. Twenty-two drawings elucidate the dis- cussion, which is brief and to the point. A minor objection concerns Gerlach's statement that sce- nic images are precluded on stamp seals because the image cannot be rolled out endlessly as on cylinder seals (p. 17). The only endless patterns created by cylinder seals are abstract geometrical designs. Figurative scenes, when rolled out, can merely be repeated. Moreover, some images of stamp seals do represent a scene as, for instance, the royal lion hunt on No. 476. Approximately half of the Near Eastern stamp seals in the Vorderasiatisches Museum come from excavations: 60 percent date to the Neo- Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods; 17 percent are Syrian from the second and first millennia B.C.; 14 percent are attributable to the third millen- nium, mainly the Jamdat Nasr period; twenty- seven seals are Phoenician and Palestinian of the first millennium; ten are Hittite; and another ten date to the Achaemenid period. The catalogue is arranged chronologically and geographically. The information given includes descriptions of shape and seal image, provenience, material and mea- surements, and bibliography.

The illustrations opposite the catalogue text show the seal base only. Draw- ings of the different types of seal shapes are given at the end of the book. The second book under review accompanies an exhibition on ancient Near Eastern seals at the Vorderasiatisches Museum and is dedicated to the memory of Edith Porada. Its aim is to give a notion of the new directions and insights ob- tained in research in the field during the past de- cades. Ten articles contributed by various scholars highlight different aspects of the seals. The thirty- three color plates inserted as a prelude give an idea of the various precious materials of the studied objects. In her introduction, Evelyn Klengel-Brandt provides an overview of the development and use of seals in the Near East throughout the millennia according to regions: Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Syria, Iran, and the Per- sian Gulf. She succeeds in combining in a pleas- ing narrative a competent discussion of the techniques of fabrication, the designs, and the various uses of seals, all against the sociopoliti- cal background of their time and place. Joachim Marzahn examines the seal cutters according to cuneiform sources. Neither Sumer- ian nor Akkadian had a term that exclusively des- ignated the profession of a seal cutter. Rather, seals were fashioned by specialists working in stone-zadim = zadimmu and bur-gul = purkul- lum-who also made jewelry, stone bowls, and other precious works, often for temples. Although both terms occur in the Fara Profession List, the chronological distribution seems to indicate that zadim was the common term in the third millen- nium and that it was replaced by purkullum in the middle of the second millennium. The author quotes and mentions a large number of texts from different periods to illustrate the fields of activity of these specialists, their professional or- ganization, and their place in society. The cunei- form sources are not always referenced, and in two cases the text editions quoted are outdated by newer ones.1 Ralf Wartke provides a useful and well- illustrated discussion of the materials of which the seals are made and of the techniques used in their fabrication. He describes the qualities of the various materials and examines their chronologi- cal distribution as well as their origin; this is il- lustrated on a map (fig. 32). No textual sources exist that discuss technology, perhaps because the artistry was passed on orally from generation to generation, and few tools have come to light. Thus the main source for the study of the tech- nology is the seals themselves, including unfin- ished and reworked pieces. Wartke distinguishes the following steps in the seal fabrication: the preparation of the cylindrical core; the central perforation; the polishing of the outside; the en- graving of the seal design; and the mounting of metal caps, handles, and so on. He then describes the various techniques and tools used over time for each step. Dominique Collon's contribution, entitled "Das Siegelbild als Kunstwerk," describes the develop- ment of seal images over time, carefully distin- guishing regional differences and pointing out the work of some workshops that she identified in previous studies. She also compares the seal imagery with imagery depicted in other media, reminding us how much of ancient Mesopota- mia's art has unfortunately not survived the test of time because of the climate (wall paintings) or the reuse of the materials in antiquity (stone and metal sculpture). Her article contains some new, if intriguing, observations: the presentation scene so popular in Ur III and Old Babylonian times is a transformation of the banquet scene predominant in the Early Dynastic period (p. 65); the frontality of some figures may have simi- lar intentions as in Byzantine art-that is, to inte- grate the beholder into the image-since many of these figures are protective spirits (p. 76); the frontality in the representation of I'tar could have its origin in Early Dynastic fertility goddesses, who were syncretized with the warrior goddess in the Akkad period (p. 76); the hero with six locks, who is often seen as gatekeeper of the wa- ter god Ea/Enki, is likened to Humbaba, Enlil's protector of the cedar forest (p. 77). Pierre Amiet addresses the interpretation of seal images, especially of the early periods. He 1 For the Curse of Agade (p. 25, n. 2), see J. S. Coo- per, The Curse of Agade (Baltimore, 1983).

Amiet describes the trans- formation of the prehistoric animal repertoire into a mythical world of imagination culminating in the anthropomorphic representation of cosmic deities. The prehistoric "master of animals," a gen- derless, animal-headed anthropoid, which seems to personify the spirit of the animal, is replaced in the Uruk period by the so-called priest-king. The anthropomorphic rendering of the goddess Inan- na, whom he confronts in the first representation of a mythological theme, seems to be developed especially for the representation of this rite. The introduction of the homed crown during the Early Dynastic period to distinguish deities from hu- man beings makes it clear that deities are now conceived of in anthropomorphic shape, though it is only in the Akkad period that they receive their cosmic aspects represented by attributes pro- truding from their body or by their hybrid servant figures. These deities correspond more or less to the traditional Mesopotamian pantheon known from texts, although the scenes in which they oc- cur represent crucial moments in the yearly cycle rather than myths known from texts. With the rise of literature first attested in the Gudea texts, this whole world of pictorial imagery becomes obso- lete. Amiet sees a direct correlation between the written expression of religious thought and what he sees as the downfall of artistic creativity in the Ur III period. This contribution, which presents in a condensed form many ideas that the author has developed over the span of his long carrier, is certainly thought-provoking, even if many aspects of method and interpretation remain debatable. Erica Bleibtreu examines the seal owners. Col- lectives as well as individuals could own a seal. Among the earliest cylinder seals of the Uruk and Jamdat Nasr period, one can distinguish two groups: high-quality seals carved in a naturalis- tic style representing a ruler figure in various ac- tivities and small, low-quality seals made of dark stones with highly stylized representations of hu- man collectives at work. The latter have been interpreted as belonging to certain institutions. A special case of collective seals are the so-called city seals, which date to the beginning of the Early Dynastic period; they represent an assemblage of signs that can be interpreted as the names of different Sumerian cities. Among individual seal owners, Bleibtreu distinguishes kings, officials, deities, and private persons. She has little success in her goal of elucidating the relation between seal holder and seal image. A consideration of pre- vious typologies of seal inscriptions and of stud- ies concerned with the relation of inscription and image would have resulted in a more lucid pic- ture of the various official and "private" seal owners. Diana Stein gives an erudite overview of the function of seals in the economy and administra- tion. After outlining the beginning of sealing prac- tice, she discusses the different types of sealings extant in the archaeological record in the fol- lowing categories: the sealing of containers; sealed bullae, labels, and tokens; door sealings; hollow bullae and numeric tablets; sealings on pottery; the sealing of administrative tablets; the certifying of legal affairs; and substitute seals. This very infor- mative discussion is well illustrated and clearly referenced. The author concludes that in the an- cient Near East seals were used for the purposes of identification and certification rather than as a signature in the modern sense. Beate Salje addresses the use of seals in the pri- vate sphere: as jewelry, amulets, and grave-goods. Seals were worn on the body much like jewelry, and they are found in graves; the apotropaic nature of the stones used for jewelry and seals is well documented. Salje describes selected seal im- ages-representations of magical rituals for cur- ing the sick, the male figure wearing a fish cloak, genies and heroes, the presentation scene-that can be understood in the context of the protective nature of the seal and compares them with similar imagery in other media. It is no coincidence that most of her examples date to the Neo-Assyrian period. Two points require comment: it remains unclear why the "fish apkallu" is once interpreted as an aslipu exorcist (p. 129) and another time as the god Asalluhi (p. 133). Maul's comparison of the exorcist's role to that of the personal god in presentation scenes, that is, the god leading the petitioner to a higher-ranked human or divine figure, is taken far beyond its purpose when the author interprets presentation scenes on Ur III and Old Babylonian seals as representations of a magical ritual known from first-millennium sources (p. 135). Presentation scenes do not be-</page><page sequence="4">OCTOBER 2001 BOOK REVIEWS 283 long in the realm of magic but visualize a rela- tionship of power and authority. Joan Aruz examines the evidence of the seals for cultural exchange. She gives examples of Me- sopotamian seals found in Egypt and Greece, for Egyptian and Minoan motifs on Syrian seals, for the adaptation of the cylinder seal and Mesopota- mian motifs in Anatolia, and for the Greek influence on Achaemenid seals. Considering the wealth of material that testifies to cultural ex- change the present choice of examples is some- what puzzling, and Aruz's method of comparison is overly simplistic. Rather than sifting out the adaptation and acculturation of motifs and styles in her examples by comparing them visually to their sources of inspiration, the author contents herself with simply enumerating the origins of adapted motifs. The mechanisms of the exchange are also not adequately discussed. The last contribution, by Barbara Feller, is concerned with the history and development of the study of ancient Near Eastern seals. Starting with an appropriate quote from Goethe's West- 5stlicher Divan, the author has a good command of her topic and succeeds in an interesting-to-read presentation. The earliest seals that reached Eu- rope were brought by ancient Romans and cru- saders; more came with the renewed interest in antiquity during the Renaissance. At first, they were treated as curiosa and appear in books on gems and cameos. A more scientific interest was linked to the decipherment of cuneiform writing in the nineteenth century. The author quotes from publications by Claudius Rich, Wilhelm Dorow and Georg Friedrich Grotefend, Fried- rich Miinter, and Felix Lajard. The material for study increased with the first excavations in the Near East as well as with the growing antiquities trade. The oldest-known fake was purchased in 1885. After outlining recent approaches and the present state of the art in the field of ancient Near Eastern glyptic, Feller concludes her contribu- tion with an homage to the pioneers who laid the foundation for the modern study of the seals: Henri Frankfort, Anton Moortgat, and Edith Porada.
