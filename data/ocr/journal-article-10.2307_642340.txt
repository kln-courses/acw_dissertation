<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GODS IN THE AENEID By ROBERT COLEMAN The supernatural forces at work in Vergil's epic narrative are succinctly presented in the opening lines - 'Italiam fato profugus Lauiniaque uenit I litora ... iactatus et alto I ui superum saeuae memorem lunonis ob iram': far more prominently too than in Homer.1 If the Stoic over- tones thatfatum carried in Augustan Latin were remote from the notion of a divine autocrat's arbitrary will, the wrath of Juno takes us back uncompromisingly to the Homeric world in which the seafaring Odysseus is perpetually harassed by Poseidon (Od. 1.20 etc.) and Hera is implacably opposed to Trojans (II. 1.536 etc.), on account of the judgement of Paris and the abduction of Ganymede, which are ex- plicitly mentioned in Aen. 1.26-8. Divine interventions were a traditional staple of epic, conferring status upon the human events portrayed and evoking a world where gods and men were closer to one another.2 The most famous statement of this effect is of course in Livy's preface: quae ante conditam condendamue urbem poeticis magis decora fabulis quam incor- ruptis rerum gestarum monumentis traduntur ea nec adfirmare nec refellere in animo est. datur haec uenia antiquitati ut miscendo humana diuinis primordia urbium augustiora faciat, et si quoi populo licere oportet consecrare origines suas et ad deos referre auctores, ea belli gloria est populo Romano ut, cum suum conditorisque sui parentem Martem potissimum ferat, tam et hoc gentes humanae patiantur aequo animo quam imperium patiuntur.3 Now the status conferred by the presence of gods, if not the actual dramatic impact of the narrative, is obviously heightened if the reader holds or can be persuaded temporarily to adopt4 some kind of belief in their existence. Where the narrative is linked causally to actual historical events that status may even be dependent on such belief.' The claim that Mars was a founding father of the Roman race becomes trivial if we cannot assent to any reality, even an abstract symbolic one, behind the name Mars. That Vergil's educated contemporaries, if they were disposed to religious belief at all, did interpret the gods whom they publicly worshipped in a symbolic way can be inferred from the demythologizing account of the traditional pantheon delivered by the Stoic Balbus in Cicero's de Natura Deorum 2.63-9.6 There the gods are represented as personified instances of the beneficent divine order in Nature.' We cannot of course transpose Balbus's precise equations into the Aeneid, but symbolic modes of interpretation were open to poets as well as to philosophers.8</page><page sequence="2">144 THE GODS IN THE AENEID At the surface level, however, poets continued to present the tradi- tional mythology of anthropomorphic gods. 'induti specie humana fabulas poetis suppeditauerunt', says Balbus (63) of his Jupiter-group. But if these myths remained the most effective poetic way of portraying a divine presence in human affairs, the use of anything more than a fragmentary personification inevitably detracted from the remoteness and sublimity of the gods.9 In fact poetry finds a close parallel in popular piety, which in ancient as in modern times attributed favour, hostility, anger to its gods; so it is not accidental that Balbus con- cludes the sentence just quoted 'hominum autem uitam superstitione omni referserunt', implicitly distancing his theology from popular religion. For as representatives of a universal beneficent order Balbus's Jupiter, Juno etc. could never be hostile to mankind.10 Men may come to harm through ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the divine plan but there is no place for supplications or placatory offerings - indeed for any of the multifarious rituals that abounded in Roman religion and were the basis of the contractual pax deorum on which the pros- perity of Rome depended.11 The reconciliation of polytheism with a more rational theology, by the very act of demythologizing the anthro- pomorphic mythology, dissociated it at once from the conventional piety and from the fabulae poetarum, for both of which a phrase like saeuae Iunonis ob iram still had a valid meaning and a live reality. It is therefore no mere coincidence that Vergil brings together in the Aeneid the divine participation of earlier epic and the rites and customs current in Augustan religious practice. Roman piety was pre- figured in the heroic age by the piety of Latins and Arcadians12 and above all of the exiled Trojans. Aeneas, custodian of Vesta and the Penates of Troy, has a dual commission that is most un-Homeric: 'dum conderet urbem/inferretque deos Latio'.13 The city is still not founded at the end of the poem but at least the gods are brought into Latium. As in earlier epic Vergil's gods intervene in two general ways: by manipulating the external world and by influencing human reactions and decisions internally. The reader may know that storms and plagues are due to natural causes but will nevertheless accept and indeed welcome the symbolic representation of them as the work of hostile deities in the context of heroic events. Sudden storms and shipwrecks were a familiar hazard of Mediterranean sea-travel. But Aeneas like Odysseus was no ordinary seafarer; his fortunes have an importance far beyond himself and his companions, and the storms that harass him are no chance phenomena but the work of a deity. The same is true of the miracles that occur in the story: fatal blows warded off, a long-range spear guided unerringly to its target, a cloak of invisibility that enables the hero to escape notice. What might be put down to</page><page sequence="3">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 145 a happy accident in the field of battle is thus attributed to divine intervention. As a result the status of the human contestants is enlarged and a contrast established between the events of the heroic past and our own times. In contrast to Homer, Vergil does not allow his gods to take part in the battle scenes, even though Roman legend itself provided a prece- dent in the intervention of the Dioscuri at Lake Regillus in 499 B.C.14 But Vergil's gods, for all their anthropomorphic representation, are set apart from the human events that they seek to influence and are occasionally, as at 10.755-60, moved to pity from afar. Internal motivation of human behaviour comes principally through dreams and visions, which are private experiences not even shared by those present with the recipient at the time. Oracles, portents, and prodigies represent an intermediate category: like storms and plagues they are not private experiences but belong to the external world. And yet like dreams and visions they affect the mind directly. Both groups of phenomena were recognized institutionally by contemporary Roman religion.15 The demythologization of internal motivations was already well advanced in Euripidean tragedy. Aphrodite, who appears in the pro- logue to Hippolytus as the vindictive Homeric goddess, is transposed once the drama is under way into an amoral impersonal force that works universally upon people's minds and when resisted - as it is by Hippolytus and Phaedra - destroys them. Even more striking is Hecuba's retort to Helen's protest in The Trojan Women that Aphrodite inspired her adultery: -jv o00 osg Ls Ki hhos EK7TpE7TEUTQTOS9, / 0 S 8 1, ~v vLv vovs T1roi-Oq K7TrpL~s.16 In Argonautica the divine interventions at this level merely anticipate what Apollonius is able to account for in psychological terms, as in the long description of Medea's falling in love, which begins with the visitation of Eros (3.275 ff.). Even her famous dream (616 ff.) is given no supernatural motivation. If the gods were not to be either puppet-manipulators or redundant metaphors of psychological events, a new role had to be found for them. In order to discover what that role was, we may start by examining the various kinds of deity that appear in the poem. Aeneas's mission was to bring gods to Latium. But of course Latium was not without gods of its own. A number are mentioned, all still worshipped in Vergil's time. Faunus, deus siluicola and ancestor of Latinus (7.213) and Tarquitus (10.551), first appears at 7.81 ff., when the Latin king seeks enlighten- ment in his oracular grove. The wild olive in which Aeneas's spear sticks is sacer Fauno (12.766-7), and it is to Faunus and Terra that Turnus prays ten lines later.</page><page sequence="4">146 THE GODS IN THE AENEID Ianus bifrons, the picturesque god of gateways, and Saturnus senex, who had fled to Latium from the conquering Olympians (8.320), are both associated together at 7.180 and 8.357, where the Roman laniculum is derived from lanus. The ceremony of opening and closing the gates of the god's temple is already established in Latium (7.610) and at 12.198 Latinus addresses his prayer to him along with Apollo and Diana. The Italian gods show no hostility to the Trojan immigrants and it is in fact the local river-god Tiberinus who appears in a dream (8.30 ff.) to encourage Aeneas and announce the imminence of the portent which had been foretold by the Trojan Helenus to his com- patriots when they called at Buthrotum (3.388 ff.). This is, perhaps significantly, one of the very few instances of an internal motivation that is not attributed to an Olympian god. The Trojans too have their own specific deities. Cybele the Phrygian goddess is the recipient of Aeneas's prayer at 10.251-5, before he renews battle with the Italians. In the previous book (9.77 ff.) she had intervened to save the Trojan ships from arson, and a compliant Jupiter had transformed them into sea-nymphs. Just before Aeneas's prayer one of the nymphs, Cymodocea - the choice of name is emphatically un-Latin - appears to him, bringing a prophecy and an omen (10.225-249) which equally amaze and encourage him. Far more important are Vesta and the Lares and Penates. For these are the gods that Aeneas brought with him from Troy to Latium.17 Vesta first appears along with Fides in Jupiter's prophecy of the Roman future (1.292) but her Trojan origin is explicit in 2.293-6, when she and the Penates are entrusted to Aeneas by Hector's ghost.18 It is to the canae penetralia Vestae and the Lar of Pergamum that Aeneas sacrifices after the appearance of Anchises's ghost (5.744), to the canae penetralia Vestae, magni Penates and the Lar of Assaracus that Ascanius calls when he sends Nisus in search of Aeneas (9.258-9). The Trojan Penatesa9 are prominent throughout the poem. They had a place of honour beside the great altar in Priam's palace (2.514) and, once entrusted to Aeneas by Hector, have a talismanic status, both reminding him of his mission and guaranteeing its safe fulfilment. Their appearance to Aeneas during the plague in Crete (3.148 ff.) is their one direct intervention in the poem. They appear to Aeneas during the night either in a dream or a vision,20 and their obscure message est locus Hesperiam etc. (163 ff.) is quickly clarified by Anchises, when it is reported to him. Now Vergil could easily have introduced Anchises's explanation (182 ff.) as an afterthought: 'I've been ponder- ing that oracle at Delos and I think we misunderstood it. For I recall there was an ancient tradition about the origin of our race, to do with</page><page sequence="5">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 147 Dardanus ...' But in fact he does not. The change of plan is crucial for the mission of the Trojans; but we are left to infer that, if they had had nothing but their native wits to guide them, the Trojans would have been incapable of extricating themselves from their plight and the mission would have come to a premature and disastrous end. Not only does the intervention of the Penates confer status on the event; it also fills a gap in the aetiology of the heroes' decision-making. One other detail is of interest here. For this is the only passage in the poem in which these Trojan deities are assimilated to the other gods and given an anthropomorphic embodiment; a detail not required by the fact that they address words to the hero. Aeneas recognizes them by their hair and faces (173-5).21 The significant repetition of lines and phrases is a familiar feature of Vergilian style (cf. canae penetralia Vestae above), and two particular instances involve the Penates. When Juno enlists the aid of Aeolus against the seaborne Trojans, she refers to 'gens inimica mihi .../ Ilium in Italiam portans uictosque penatis' (1.67-8). In 8.9 the Tiburtine Venulus is sent - unsuccessfully as it turns out (11.252-95) - to enlist the aid of the Argive Diomedes, now settled at Argyripa, against these same Trojans, who have followed him to Italy bringing with them their uictos penatis. In 3.12 Aeneas sets forth disconsolate over the sea from Troy 'cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis'. The central scene on Aeneas's shield (8.679) shows Augustus sailing to victory at Actium 'cum patribus populoque penatibus et magnis dis'.22 The gods defeated at Troy are to triumph in Italy before the poem is ended, and in the distant future the inauguration of the pax Augusta will complete the divinely ordained mission that began with Aeneas's journey into exile. The gods whom we have considered thus far are all assigned speci- fically to either Italian or Trojan piety. Both groups were to be com- bined in the religion of the new city. Individually they may intervene now and then in the narrative but none of them has a sustained role in shaping events. In this respect they contrast with the Olympian group, familiar from the Homeric tradition. Of the Olympians Neptune appears only in Trojan contexts. The Trojans are after all the seafarers of the story and Neptune's element is the sea. Moreover, as the Latin equivalent23 of Poseidon he easily assumes Poseidon's Homeric role of Trojan patron. Laocoon was his priest at Troy (2.201) and, although his old anger at Laomedon's treachery finally prompted him (2.610, 5.810-11) to overthrow the walls he himself had built, he continues to be honoured by the Trojans and favourable to their voyage. Thus he is one of the deities to whom Anchises sacrifices on the receipt of Apollo's oracle at Delos (3.119) and it is from his altar in Sicily (5.640) that the women draw the fire</page><page sequence="6">148 THE GODS IN THE AENEID brands to attack the ships. Although it is more from outraged vanity at Aeolus's encroachment on his prerogatives than from concern for the harassed Trojans that he moves to quell the storm (1.124 ff.), he readily complies with Venus's request for a calm passage from Sicily to Italy (5.779-863) and of his own accord provides favourable winds for the voyage past Circe's lands (7.23). On the shield of Aeneas he and Venus give a 'Trojan' weighting to the triad of Olympian deities supporting Augustus at Actium (8.699). The third member of this group, Minerva, was not so tied. She has temples on both the Trojan citadel (1.479) and the coast of Calabria (3.531); and Aeneas can assume that olive branches worn by his men (7.154: ramis ... Palladis) will be immediately recognized by King Latinus as a sign of peace. Minerva had of course long been equated with the Greek Pallas Athena, who had been a patron of Diomedes and the Argive army in the Iliad and of Telemachus and his father in the Odyssey. The wooden horse was represented as a dedication to her (2.17, 31), the serpents that destroyed Laocoon make off to her shrine (2.226) and she is one of the deities whom Venus reveals to Aeneas presiding over the destruction of the city (2.615). Ajax's sacrilege had subsequently turned her against the Greeks (1.39) and she shows no hostility to the Trojans in their journey.24 The vain supplications of the Latin women at Minerva's temple in 11.475 ff. recall the vain supplications of the Trojan women to her depicted on the walls of Juno's Carthaginian temple at 1.479. She was to have an honoured place in Roman worship and it was the descendants of Aeneas who were destined finally to avenge the sacrilege of Ajax (6.840). Her presence at Actium with the two 'Trojan' gods perhaps symbolizes the reconciliation of ancient enmities. Apollo, whose temple overlooked the victory at Actium and whose patronage Augustus recognized by building a new temple for him at Rome (8.704, 720), is naturally prominent in the poem. His worship is ubiquitous: he has an oracular cult at Troy (2.114), Dido's ill-omened sacrifice is offered to him among other gods (4.58), the bay tree in Latinus's palace yard is dedicated to him (7.62), he had guided Evan- der's exiled Arcadians (8.336) and the Etruscan Arruns seeks his aid as sancti custos Soractis even against his sister Diana's favourite Camilla (11.785). But it is with the Trojan wanderers that he is especially associated, continuing the patronage he had bestowed on Troy in the Iliad, and at 6.56 Aeneas addresses him as 'grauis Troiae semper miserate labores'. His interventions in the external world are rare. In addition to the warning plague in Crete (3.137 ff.) the protection of Ascanius in Book 9 is of particular interest. The lad has just excited the Trojans by</page><page sequence="7">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 149 shooting Remulus (9.632-7) and is eager for the fight (661). But his companions restrain him and he takes no further part in the battle. Surely no divine initiative is needed to add to the protective concern that they show for their absent leader's son. Yet Apollo appears to Ascanius, disguised as Butes, only to be recognized by the Trojans as he departs (659-60). This warning intervention adds nothing to the motivation of events; what it does is to confer status on Ascanius's first martial exploit. Furthermore Vergil chooses this moment for the prophetic Olympian to reassert the glorious destiny of Ascanius's descendants: 'macte noua uirtute, puer, sic itur ad astra, / dis genite et geniture deos' (641-2). It is by his prophetic guidance that the god helps the Trojans most in their wanderings. The oracle at Delos is greeted by a sacrifice to Apollo together with Neptune, Hiems, and the Zephyrs (3.119-20). Dido mentions similar prophecies elsewhere (4.345-6) and Helenus, having announced his own prophecy to the Trojans, concludes (3.395) 'fata uiam inuenient aderitque uocatus Apollo'. The only time that Aeneas invokes the god's direct intervention is when he is about to close with Mezentius (10.875), and to this we shall return. In his representation of Diana Vergil draws on the whole complex of Greek and Italian associations that she had acquired in the Latin religious tradition. Thus in the famous simile at 1.498 ff. she is the majestic Artemis; at the start of Dido's magic rite she is invoked as the threefold Hecate, tria uirginis ora Dianae (4.511); the Trojan Nisus prays to the nemorum Latonia custos in the form of Luna (9.403-5). In the Italian half of the poem the specifically Latin title Triuia recurs: it is to Triuiae lucos that Aeneas is led by the Sibyl (6.13), the temple of Diana at Aricia is dedicated expressly to Trivia (7.764, 778),25 and the Latin priest Haemonides serves Phoebus and Trivia (10.537). Diana's only intervention is very Homeric in design and detail but is given a thoroughly Italian context. Unable to save her Volscian favourite Camilla fromfata acerba (11.587), she promises to spirit away her body for burial in her native land (594) and to punish her killer Arruns.26 In typical Olympian fashion she works through an agent, the nymph Opis, who on the completion of the undertaking (867) 'ad aetherium pennis aufertur Olympum'. The Olympians who influence the course of events most of all are Juno, Venus, and Jupiter, who are, appropriately, most fully character- ized. Juno's hatred of Trojans, conceived long ago (1.27-8), is aggravated in the poem by the injury done by Trojans to her favourite city Carthage (1.15-16).27 Mindful of this hostility, Aeneas is meticulous in observing the advice to honour her that is given by Helenus at Buthrotum (3.437-</page><page sequence="8">150 THE GODS IN THE AENEID 8, 546-7) and by the god Tiberinus in Latium (8.60, 84), in both instances to no avail. The ubiquity of her worship is made prominent. She is the patron of the Carthaginians and the first building completed by Dido's im- migrant community is a temple in her honour, adorned with scenes of her latest triumph - over Troy (1.456 ff.) - which Aeneas with pathetic irony misinterprets (459-63). The queen addresses her hospitality-prayer to Juno along with Jupiter and Bacchus (1.731-4) and Juno is the chief recipient of her anxious sacrifice in 4.59. The Italians too have their cults of Juno: she has a temple of which Calybe is priestess (7.419) and is the patron of Gabii (682-3) and protector of Turnus too, as he claims with tragic irony in 438-9. But devotion to the goddess brings no greater reward to her favourites than to her foes. Both Dido and Turnus are doomed to violent deaths, Carthage is left in disarray, the Italian opposition to Aeneas crushed and she herself is finally forced to put aside her anger and accept Jupiter's assurance that the new united community of Trojans and Italians at Rome will always hold her in high honour (12.838-41). Her first intervention is a violent one in the external world, the storm that wrecks the Trojan fleet on the African coast. Unlike Poseidon in the Odyssey, who as sea-god could harass seafarers directly, Juno has to work through a lesser deity, Aeolus (1.50 ff.). The storm has grave consequences for the Trojans and so must be elevated above the mere vagaries of the Mediterranean climate, and that status is conferred by the divine initiative. Two external interventions by Juno occur in Book 7. The Fury Allecto, enlisted as Juno's agent, crosses the scent for Ascanius's hounds during a hunt (475 ff.) and Silvia's pet stag is shot. Accidents often happen on hunting expeditions: one thinks of the hind carelessly shot by the Cretan shepherd in the Dido-simile of 4.69 ff. But once again nothing that contributes so critically to the story can be relegated to mere chance. Later in the book King Latinus, fortified against the rising war hysteria by Faunus's oracle (7.96-101), refuses to open the Gates of War; so Juno descends from heaven to open them herself (6.18 ff.). An accident? The gates had been insecurely fastened ... a sudden gust of wind ... No, the event is decisive and must therefore be attributed to the supernatural agency that is persistently working against the Trojans. Finally in 9.745 we have a purely Iliadic inter- vention. Pandarus's spear is 'miraculously' turned at the last moment and Turnus is unharmed. We often use this adverb as a facile synonym for 'luckily, fortunately', but a miracle it literally is here and it confers heroic status upon its beneficiary. There are a number of instances of internal motivation by Juno.</page><page sequence="9">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 151 While the funeral games for Anchises are taking place, the Trojan women are absent, alone on the shore mourning the lost patriarch and depressed at the thought of their never-ending sea-travel (5.604 ff.). Juno seizes the opportunity to send Iris to them disguised as one of them, and she inspires them to set fire to the ships. Nothing in their character or even in their present dispirited mood has indicated the possibility of such aggressive frenzy. Their behaviour is inexplicable in terms of ordinary human motivation and some extraordinary cause must be sought. A supernatural force has momentarily possessed them and that force can be none other than the deity constantly opposing Aeneas.28 In Book 7 Allecto's career of havoc begins with a vain attack on King Latinus (341 ff.). She is more successful with his consort Amata (373 ff.), who with her attendants is possessed by a seemingly Bacchant madness, simulato numine Bacchi (385). The queen was of course more promising material; for she had favoured Turnus as a prospective son- in-law (56-7), even though she must like Latinus have known the oracle (104-6). Turnus himself might have seemed an easy target too. For like the African chieftain larbas (4.196 ff.), he has good cause for anger when an eligible bride has been snatched from him by an alien intruder.29 However, when Allecto comes to him disguised as the old priestess Calybe, he dismisses her with a very Homeric - and very Roman - retort: 'bella uiri pacemque gerent quis bella gerenda' (7.444). Finally, assuming her own form, the Fury hurls her torch at him and he goes berserk: 'arma amens fremit, arma toro tectisque requirit; / saeuit amor ferri et scelerati insania belli, / ira super'. The war-hysteria is now under way in earnest. Would Turnus have reacted so violently without Allecto's goading? We see too little of him before this to form much idea of his character30 but there is no hint that he would be given to outbreaks of furor naturally, as Mezentius - and Aeneas - clearly are. In the speech rally- ing his terrified comrades after the metamorphosis of Aeneas's ships even the defiant nil mefatalia terrent (9.133), if it is not simply rhetoric for the occasion, can be read as the utterance of a man still not in possession of himself. For it was Juno who through Iris31 inspired him to attack the Trojan camp in Aeneas's absence. The idea was reasonable enough strategically and Vergil could easily have motivated it in purely human terms. Instead he assigns it to divine intervention, implying that the goddess was constrained to keep up the pressure on Turnus, who, if left to himself, might have reverted to a more circum- spect attitude. After the Council of the Gods in Book 10 Juno is as much preoccupied</page><page sequence="10">152 THE GODS IN THE AENEID with saving Turnus as with harassing Aeneas. At 10.606 ff. she is granted one last request by Jupiter to intervene directly in the battle. Creating a phantom of Aeneas (636-7), she lures Turnus on to a ship, sets it adrift (659-60) and so rescues him from danger. We may de- mythologize this easily enough: Turnus suffers a momentary hallucina- tion and the ship on which he finds himself accidentally drifts away taking him with it. But this is Turnus's last escape and the occasion is magnified by the divine intervention, which is effected in two stages: firstly at the internal level, since the hallucination is private to Turnus (though like other internal phenomena - dreams and visions - it has of course to be externalized in description); secondly at the external level by the act of cutting the ship adrift. The incident is based on two Homeric interventions by Apollo, the rescue of Aeneas from Diomedes, who is left confronting a mere phantom (II. 5.449 ff.), and the rescue of Hector from Achilles, when the Trojan hero is wrapped in a mist (II. 20.443 ff.).32 Like Diomedes and Achilles Turnus is deluded; like Aeneas and Hector he is saved. The incident underlines Turnus's Iliadic status. But Vergil also uses it to characterize him. For, when he comes to his senses, far from being grateful for the rescue he protests vehemently to Jupiter: 'omnipotens genitor, tanton me crimine dignum / duxisti et talis uoluisti expendere poenas?' (668-9). He is humiliated by the thought that he has deserted his men, trapped and helpless as they now are, and Juno has forcibly to restrain him from committing suicide or returning to the fray (680- 88). To have left his comrades in the lurch and saved his own skin is the last thing Turnus would have done, if he had been in full possession of himself. The divine intervention that effects his rescue does so by compelling him to act out of character. Juno's last intervention is at 12.134 ff. Having now exhausted the last concession from Jupiter, she can now promote her cause only through the agency of others. She appears to Turnus's sister the nymph Juturna, urging her to aid him now that imparia fata are closing in on him (149-51). It is perhaps a sign of her desperation that she treats the victim of one of her husband's amorous escapades so charitably (140-5). She leaves Juturna 'incertam et tristi turbatam uolnere mentis' (160) but obedient and ready to act like Iris as one of the goddess's supernatural agents (468 ff.), until she is put to flight by Jupiter's intervention (854 ff.). Vergil might well have explained Juturna's intrusion solely by her fears for her brother, but once again the impli- cation is that without Juno's instigation Juturna would not have acted as she did. Indeed the sister's intrusion marks the desperation of a hero who had once dismissed a woman with the words 'bella uiri pacemque gerent quis bella gerenda'.</page><page sequence="11">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 153 If Juno's role is roughly comparable to Poseidon's in the Odyssey, Venus's corresponds to Athena's. She is of course, as Dido notes (1.618), the mother of Aeneas and unlike Juno she is worshipped only by the Trojans. Before setting sail Aeneas sacrifices to her and to the diui auspices (3.19) and at Eryx he founds a temple in her honour, dedicating the nearby grove to the memory of his father (5.759-61). It is perhaps surprising that Venus is not addressed in any of Dido's love-stricken rites (4.58-9, 510-11); but then Carthage is Juno's terri- tory. More surprisingly Aeneas pays no homage to her at the site of Rome. The portentous sow is offered to placate Juno before his arrival (8.84-5); after the vision of the arms in the sky (520 ff.) he sacrifices with Evander to Hercules and the Arcadian Lar and Penates; and on receipt of the armour, including the great shield on which the goddess's presence at Actium (699) brings together her Trojan patronage in the poem and the mythical descent of the gens lulia, he does nothing but gaze at it in uncomprehending wonder before taking it on his shoulders (729-31). Venus's first interventions in the poem are immediately after the ship-wreck in Book 1 and Jupiter's reassuring prophecy. Aeneas of his own accord sets out with Achates to explore and Venus appears to him - but apparently not to Achates - in the guise of Diana (1.329).33 It is rare for the Olympians to appear in person to mortals in the Aeneid; usually they communicate, as they intervene in events, through minor supernatural agents - Cupid, Iris, Allecto, Mercury. But of course the maternal relationship allows a special intimacy both here and in Book 8; indeed at 407-9 Aeneas reproaches her for having deceived him by the disguise. The effect of the encounter is remarkable. Aeneas at 208-9 was intensely dispirited, more so than at any time since the departure from Troy, but henceforth he proceeds with more confidence. The implication is plain. A sudden transformation of the hero occurs that cannot be explained in purely human terms; so a divine intervention is called upon to fill the gap in causation.34 There follows a divine manipulation of the external world: Venus throws a mist around both the Trojans. How was it, we should otherwise have been tempted to ask, that they managed to enter Carthage and remain miraculously unobserved (mirabile dictu, says Vergil himself (439), forestalling our incredulity)? Venus provides the answer: she was responsible for the miracle. Venus had already intervened to guide her son during the sack of Troy. Aeneas witnesses in horror the sacrilegious slaughter of Priam (2.550-3) at the very altar where Hecuba and her daughters had vainly sought refuge (515 ff.). Suddenly he recalls the danger that his own father, wife, and son are in, left alone in the house that he has recklessly</page><page sequence="12">154 THE GODS IN THE AENEID deserted (559 ff.). But the sight of Helen seeking sanctuary in Vesta's temple distracts him to wild thoughts of vengeance.3s His mother appears, to reproach him: 'quis indomitas tantus dolor excitat iras?/ quid furis?' (594-5), and to recall him to his proper concern for his family, repeating Hector's exhortation (289-95) to flee. The implication is clearly that, left to himself, he would have abandoned himself to furor, as he does immediately after the death of Pallas in Book 10, when he slaughters the suppliant Magus (521 ff.) and Haemonides, the priest of Phoebus and Trivia, dressed in full ceremonial robes (537 ff.), and exults over the death of young Lausus (786 ff.), and above all in the final horrifying dismissal of Turnus's supplication at the end of the poem. No divine guidance is at hand to save him from himself on these occasions. But at Troy the divine intervention checks the furor that lies close to the surface of his character. Reverting to Carthage, we come next (1.657-756) to the ruse that is Venus's response and the structural counterpart to Juno's initiative in causing the storm. Jupiter has already despatched Mercury to Carthage (297 ff.) to ensure a friendly reception for the Trojans, which they could not otherwise have expected in a town dedicated to Juno. But Venus, still suspicious of Tyrian treachery (661), decides to exploit her departmental power by inspiring Dido to fall in love with Aeneas, whom she has already (588-93) invested with a god-like beauty. Now it is possible that, left alone, Dido would have fallen for Aeneas. In her welcoming speech she remarked on the similarity of their fortunes (628-9), and Anna at 4.39-44, by now preaching to the con- verted, advances good rational arguments in favour of Aeneas as a consort. But in fact there is not the slightest hint in Dido's opening speech or at any time before Venus's ruse that she is likely to fall in love with him. The ruse itself, when demythologized, has obvious psychological overtones. Cupid is sent to impersonate Ascanius. It is while Dido caresses the child (717-21) that the goddess's poison does its work and Aeneas's half-brother, disguised as his son, gradually over- comes her devotion to the memory of Sychaeus, the betrayal of which she later (4.552) comes to blame upon herself. Now the real Ascanius, image of his father (4.84-5), might well have had a powerful effect upon the childless Dido,36 awakening her frustrated maternal instincts. The details of Vergil's text thus show that he could have motivated Dido in purely human terms. But while the attractions of the handsome foreign prince, the fellow-feeling for a refugee, the advantages of a male consort and the hope of children might explain why a queen could fall in love, they cannot account for the utter disintegration in her character that results from that love. The regal authority she had exercised when Aeneas first saw her is now gone. The description of</page><page sequence="13">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 155 her, following the Diana-simile, at 1.507-8 - 'iura dabat legesque uiris operumque laborem / partibus aequabat iustis aut sorte trahebat' - may well have sent shudders through Vergil's male-chauvinist readers, still haunted by memories of Cleopatra. But it reveals a woman totally in command of herself and her kingdom, not the sort of woman liable to be reduced to a total wreck for love of any man. The change is explicable only in terms of some external force that inspires her to act wholly out of character. Hence the aptness of the images that haunt her dreams (4.469 ff.): Pentheus and Orestes, both of them insane victims of divine power. Juno is naturally cooperative and after Venus's lying words about Aeneas's future (4.110-2) she offers to solemnize the union: 'conubio iungam stabili ... hic hymenaeus erit' (126-7). On the day she causes the storm that drives the couple to the cave (160-2; cf. 120-1) and there presides as pronuba (166). No wonder Dido is deceived into believing she is legitimately married! Only the lightning flash and the wail of the nymphs at the nuptials (167-8) give warning that this is no joyous occasion but leti ... malorum causa. By contrast no divine intervention is needed to awaken Aeneas's love. Indeed this was not at all part of Venus's design. labefactus amore he certainly is (4.395) but the love is quite spontaneous and there is no divine possession to destroy his reason. On the contrary he takes over the superintendence of the very building operations (260) which he had once gazed on so wistfully (1.437) and Dido's indisposition had now brought to a halt (4.86-9). Resplendent in the gear that Dido has given him, including a cloak embroidered by her own hand (261-4), he seems content in his role as consort and in the work of building a city, the only city that he is ever to be involved in building in the poem. It is perhaps the only time that we see him truly happy. At this moment Jupiter intervenes, sending Mercury to remind the hero of his mission (cf. 229-36) and to speed him on his way. Mercury's speech to Aeneas skilfully plays upon the hero's prejudices and emotions: he begins with the taunting uxorius, contrasts the building of Carthage with the quest for the new Troy that Aeneas has forgotten and ends with an appeal to his sense of responsibility towards his son, 'quoi regnum Italiae Romanaque tellus / debetur' (275-6).37 The speech contains all the ingredients out of which Vergil, had he so chosen, could have provided a spontaneous motivation for Aeneas's decision to leave Dido. His words to the queen in 354-9 reveal that he has already been reflecting very much on the lines of Mercury's argument even before the theophany. But there is no hint that these reflections or the appearance of the turbida ... imago of his father to him in dreams (351-3) would have moved him to forsake his new-found</page><page sequence="14">156 THE GODS IN THE AENEID happiness for the pursuit of his mission. It is precisely because he has forgotten his own affairs (267) that he is so shattered by Mercury's visitation: 'aspectu obmutuit amens / arrectaeque horrore comae et uox faucibus haesit' (279-80).38 There is no need then to doubt the sincerity of his words to Dido in the underworld: 'inuitus regina tuo de litore cessi. / sed me iussa deum ...' (6.460-1). Vergil's narrative has demon- strated it. Aeneas's self-defence merely repeats what the poet tells us in 4.393-6; and Jupiter, who has to drive him from his love, takes care that his eyes and ears are closed to Dido's entreaties (331-4, 440-49). In the affair both Aeneas and Dido act out of character, Dido in the manner of her falling in love, Aeneas in the final suppression of his love;39 and this is indicated by the timing and nature of the inter- vention by the deities. In Book 5 Venus's request to Neptune (779 ff.) provides again a counter-balancing intervention, this time to Juno's attempt to fire the ships. It is a critical moment in the story; for the Trojans are beginning the last stage of the journey to Italy. Their previous attempt ended in the shipwreck on the shore of Africa and Venus is apprehensive of some further effort by Juno to thwart Jupiter's command and the fates (784). Neptune reminds her of his loyal services to Aeneas at Troy (803-4) and assures her of a calm voyage to Italy - at the price of one life, 'unum pro multis dabitur caput' (815). Even a god must be paid. The helmsman Palinurus is overcome by sleep and drowns (854 ff.). When Aeneas meets his unburied shade on this side of the Styx (6.337 ff.), he reproaches Apollo for having deceived him. (The prophecy referred to is not recorded elsewhere.) Palinurus in reply rejects the suggestion, adding 'nec me deus aequore mersit. / namque gubernaclum multa ui forte reuolsum ... praecipitans traxi mecum'. Such accidents happen at sea. The contradiction of 5.815 is surely deliberate and significant. A divine intervention will always appear, unless it is accompanied by an overt sign, to be a chance event, un- predictable and inexplicable. Vergil gives us here an important clue to the way in which we must interpret his divine machinery. Conforming to the pattern of her earlier interventions, Venus's prominence in the latter part of Book 8 follows close upon Juno's machinations among the Italians in Book 7. First she sends a portent to Aeneas and Achates, which lifts them from their mood of depression (522-3), and this is followed by the presentation of the armour that she has persuaded Vulcan to make for Aeneas. This is of course no mere issue of new equipment. That could have been provided by human agency. This armour like the set which the god had made at Thetis's request for Achilles - a precedent recalled both by Venus (383-4) and later Turnus (11.438-40) - will guarantee the hero's invincibility.</page><page sequence="15">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 157 Moreover the scenes depicted upon the great shield represent the burden of destiny Aeneas must bear, famamque et fata nepotum cul- minating in the pax Augusta. Its importance both for the plot of the poem and for its ideology demands a divine initiative. Her later interventions are all external and conform to the more Iliadic texture of the narrative in these books. Thus she protects Aeneas from a shower of arrows (10.331-2), heals his wounded leg in the battle (12.411 ff., though it still troubles in the final duel, 746-7) and releases his spear from the wild olive where it has been fixed by Faunus in response to Turnus's prayer (12.766-86), an instance of a superior deity upstaging a lesser one that would have delighted Homer's audiences. The frequency of these intrusions is proof of her mounting anxiety over the ultimate success and indeed safety of her son (cf. 10.46-50). On each occasion the incident can be demythologized very simply as 'a piece of unexpected and indeed inexplicable good luck'. But it is given an explication, and one that confers status upon the hero and his fortunes. Finally Jupiter. Like Apollo and Juno he is worshipped universally. He has shrines in North Africa (4.199) and is patron of Anxur in Italy (7.799); the Arcadians believe in his presence on the Capitoline hill (8.353) and Evander prays to him (572-3). In Carthage Dido invokes him as a god of hospitality when she welcomes the Trojans (1.731). But he is also the father of the Dardanian race, as Ilioneus's speech to King Latinus relevantly recalls (7.219-20). Indeed he is the chief recipient of Trojan piety, for instance at 2.689, 3.116 (Anchises), 3.21, 5.687, 12.496 (Aeneas), 9.624 (Ascanius). Both the Trojan and Italian associations point forward to the Roman cult of Iuppiter Capitolinus, alluded to on Aeneas's shield (8.640). But it is in close association with Fate that Jupiter's role in the poem is most clearly shown. The Vergilian concept of Fate is notoriously difficult to define. The Parcae, traditionally equated with the Motpat, manufacture all that is fated to be ('extremaque Lauso / Parcae fila legunt' in 10.814-5), and both Juno (1.22-3) and Venus (5.796-7) acknowledge their superior power. Hence, although Jupiter admin- isters the operations of Fate, the fates cannot be understood as emanating from him. It is true that in 3.375-6 Helenus declares that 'sic fata deum rex / sortitur uoluitque uices', apparently assigning to Jupiter powers that belong to the Parcae (sic uoluere Parcas in 1.22). But here as everywhere else it is important to distinguish the voice of the created character from the voice of the creating narrator. Helenus's exordium has a deliberate mood of 'impressive mystery'40 and cannot therefore be taken as the poet's view of the relation between Jupiter and Fate. Moreover a clear counter-example is put into the</page><page sequence="16">158 THE GODS IN THE AENEID mouth of the god himself in the course of his angry outburst in 10.8-9: 'abnueram bello Italiam concurrere Teucris. / quae contra uetitum dis- cordia?'41 For the war must have been fated - the implication of Jupiter's own words in 1.261-3 is clear enough - and yet it is equally clearly contrary to the god's wishes. This situation is admittedly unusual. In general Jupiter's expressed will is in accord with Fate's decrees and he himself is as bound by those decrees as any of the divine or human characters in the story. A phrase like Dido'sfata louis poscunt (4.614) is not conclusive even for her own view of Jupiter and Fate. For it could mean the Fates 'ordained by Jupiter' or merely 'kept in his possession'. But most probably, if we recall Aeneas's mandata in 357, it means simply 'the decrees or pronouncements of Jupiter'. This last sense of fata (in fact its oldest) is found frequently in the poem with a dependent subjective genitive;42 e.g. fatisque deum defensus iniquis (2.257) of the traitor Sinon and fatis Iunonis iniquae (8.292) of Hercules's labours. In louis imperio fatisque (5.784) from Venus's request to Neptune fatis could be either 'Fate' or 'the decrees of Jupiter'. Sometimes Jupiter is represented as the active collaborator with Fate or even as its agent, e.g. 'fata obstant placidasque uiri deus obstruit auris' (4.440; cf. 651). But then so also is Juno, for instance in 1.30-2, where her anger 'Troas ... / arcebat longe Latio multosque per annos / errabant acti fatis maria omnia circum'. The wanderings are fated but the precise course they take is due to Juno. Conversely while she is responsible for the Trojans' presence in Africa, it is fated (299) that they be received hospitably at Carthage. A close parallel to the coupling of fata and deus in 4.440 is offered by Helenus's words at 3.379-80: 'prohibent nam cetera Parcae/ scire Helenum farique uetat Saturnia Iuno'.43 Prophets like Helenus are vouchsafed rather more knowledge of what has been and is to be than the rest of us. The inability to discern the patterns of Fate leads men to ascribe what happens to chance.44 Hence fata andfortuna or casus are closely associated on a number of occasions. The Trojans who are actifatis (1.32) are said by Venus to be tot casibus actos (1.240). Nautes at 5.709 advises Aeneas 'quo fata trahunt retra- huntque sequamur." quidquid erit superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est'. Evander links Fortuna omnipotens with ineluctabile fatum (8.334) and Juno concludes her plea to Juturna with the words 'qua uisa est Fortuna pati Parcaeque sinebant / cedere res Latio, Turnum et tua moenia texi. / nunc iuuenem imparibus uideo concurrere fatis / Par- carumque dies et uis inimica propinquat.' (12.147-50). Even to a deity the ways of Fate may at times seem whimsical.46 Jupiter's reassurance to Venus in 1.257-8 that 'manent immota</page><page sequence="17">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 159 tuorum / fata tibi' raises the question: how rigid is Fate? Jupiter himself, this time reassuring Juno of his impartiality in a short speech in which fortuna and fata both occur twice within six lines, declares that 'sua quoique exorsa laborem / fortunamque ferent' (10.111-12). This sug- gests that an individual's initiative can at least be a contributory to the nexus naturalium causarum47 that constitutes his fate. Not that the initiative is free where the individual's judgement is distorted by divine possession, as with Dido and Turnus, or driven by divine threat and exhortation, as with Aeneas. But sua exorsa does seem to introduce an element into the narrative that is not wholly laid down in advance. Moreover, though the broad outline of events is certainly laid down, their detailed course and tempo are not.48 Thus Vulcan in 8.398-9 can inform Venus that 'nec pater omnipotens Troiam nec fata uetabant / stare decemque alios Priamum superesse per annos'. In fact the inter- ventions of Venus and Juno both have the effect of complicating and delaying the working out of Fate, but they cannot alter its course, as Juno recognizes in 1.21-2 and 10.67. Most of Jupiter's interventions are directed to resolving these complications and speeding these delays. Sometimes however he intervenes merely to keep Fate on course. Thus at 2.687 ff. Anchises prays for a sign from the god to validate the portent of Iulus's halo. A meteor appears and the old man is at last persuaded, as it seems nothing else could have persuaded him, to flee with his son and grandson from burning Troy. At 7.107 ff. the Trojans, newly landed in Italy, are inspired by the god (monebat) to use their wafers as plates, so fulfilling Celaeno's prophecy (3.255-7).49 In 11.901 'saeua louis sic numina poscunt' reveals that the furor that is now manifest in 'his inability to organize his campaign rationally'50 is not only the work of the saeuae Iunonis numina unwittingly acting as the agent of Fate but is also approved by Jupiter, whose divine will assents to Fate's decrees. One intervention in the later books is worth looking at in detail, since unlike most of the other internal motivations exhibited in the poem it is causally redundant."s At 10.689 ff. Jupiter inspires the Etruscan Mezentius to enter the battle. The epithet ardens that is used of him along with alacer and acer (cf. 729, 897) suggests that he needed no divine monita to urge him on. However Jupiter's attention confers special status on his entry at this point and its sequel. In the preceding two books Mezentius has been the most prominent warrior on the Italian side after Turnus. The contrast between the two is great. Unlike the pious Turnus Mezentius is contemptor diuom (7.648; cf. 8.7), and his quick temper and brutal arrogance (8.481-2, 569-71, 10.742) are due not to any divine possession but to natural disposition. This is to be his last appearance on the battlefield; after beholding his son's</page><page sequence="18">160 THE GODS IN THE AENEID corpse he too will die at the hand of Aeneas, unmourned by his own people (10.904-5). It seems then that Jupiter in summoning him to battle is despatching him to the executioner who will put an end to his career of savagery. But all these are minor interventions by Jupiter compared with his efforts to counteract Venus and Juno. He sends Mercury to Carthage, first in Book 1 to forestall further hostile action by Juno, and then again in Book 4 to set Fate on course after the distractions and delays brought about by the unholy alliance of the goddesses. At 5.685 ff., when Juno acting through Iris inspires the women to attack the ships, he sends a rainstorm to quench the flames in answer to Aeneas's prayer. The good fortune of a sudden shower is thus converted into an example of pietas rewarded and the rescue of the ships given an appropriately magnified status. Later in the same book imperio louis (5.726) Anchises appears to Aeneas in a dream to urge him on his way, leaving the older members of his party with Acestes in Sicily. Nautes had already advised just such a course (704 ff.), but there is no suggestion that without the divine intervention Aeneas would have heeded his prophetic advice. At 9.77 ff., after Juno instigates the attack on the Trojan camp, Jupiter intervenes in response to Cybele's entreaty, to save the ships once again. The metamorphosis is a sign to both sides that even in their leader's absence the Trojans can still trust in their destiny, and Turnus's misconstruction of the portent provides a context for charac- terizing his defiant qualities of leadership. In Book 10 Jupiter allows Juno one last intervention on Turnus's behalf (96 ff.). After the Iliadic weighing of the fates of Aeneas and Turnus Jupiter extracts Juno's final submission (12.807 ff.). He sends one of the Dirae in the form of an owl to confront Turnus and his sister. The eerie apparition alarms Turnus (867-8) in a way that Aeneas completely fails to do (894-5) and drives Juturna from the battlefield that she has hitherto stubbornly refused to quit. Turnus is left alone to fight it out with Aeneas. He had been driven to furor first by the Dira Allecto sent by Juno; now it is a Dira sent by Jupiter that heralds the disastrous outcome of that furor. From all this we can now infer a particular significance in the ambiguous uses of fata noted earlier (p. 158): the decrees of one deity, intended to impede the progress of Fatum, turn out to be its unwitting vehicle, the decrees of another, intended to hasten its progress, may turn out temporarily to delay it. But above all stands Jupiter ready to inter- vene if Fatum is too far off course or schedule.52 Now the idea of Fate as a mechanism that needs to be continually tinkered with is decidedly odd; it is rather as if the 18th century Deists' clock, having been wound up by the Creator, not only struck its</page><page sequence="19">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 161 appointed hours at unpredictable intervals but needed constant adjust- ment by the divine clock-maker to ensure that it would strike at all. But such a conception of Fate was unavoidable if there was to be any place for actions by men or gods that was not just part of the mechan- ism itself. Logically it would have been far simpler to return to the more loosely structured Homeric theodicy, with its more rudimen- tary ideas of tot-oa and A o's fovA4, or else like Lucan to have retained the concept of a constraining and immutable Fate while eliminating independent interventions by the gods. But Vergil needed both Fate and the gods in his poem, for artistic as well as ideological reasons. Fate was needed to bind the sequence of events in the poem, which began with the flight from Troy, to the long centuries of Roman history which culminated in the imperial pax Augusta. Equally he needed the gods: not only because the story of his poem, like the Odyssey, is a sequel to the Iliad contemporaneous with the wander- ings of Odysseus (cf. the episode of Achaemenides in 3.588 ff.), but also because the gods of the Homeric Trojan, as of the traditional Italian, mythological past were still part of contemporary Roman religion. Jupiter, Venus, and Juno, Faunus and the Penates all had their own history, which was also the history of the people who worshipped them. Divine intervention in the external world - the raising and quelling of storms, the sending of portents etc. - is as much a feature of Roman history as it is of literary mythology. Juno can thus be seen as represent- ing the superhuman forces that seem to be working against the com- pletion of the Trojan journey,5" Venus the forces that seem to be assisting it. So far as internal motivation is concerned, psychological explanation, as we noted earlier (p. 145), had already diminished the area of divine activity. Nevertheless there are certain crucial decisions and actions in the lives of men that cannot be accounted for in terms of what is known of their characters. These lacunae in our under- standing of internal motivation, which might be put down to 61Aot aratLa dvOpwTrvwy AoytLacr/, are in the Aeneid attributed to external super- natural forces acting upon the human mind.54 The gods of traditional epic have thus found a new role and one that has much in common with the 'God of the gaps' in modern theology. Dido and Turnus are both destroyed by the onset of afuror that is apparently out of character. Hence it is assigned to the agency of Venus and Juno operating respectively through Cupid and Allecto. Modern readers may demyth- ologize these divine interventions into current theories of natural causation and interpret them as mental breakdowns, pathological con- ditions and the like, but there is no justification for interpreting as Vergilian allegory55 an aetiology that accords both with the traditions</page><page sequence="20">162 THE GODS IN THE AENEID of the literary genre and with conventional piety. However, in their variety, elaboration and complexity the external and internal motiva- tions by gods go far beyond anything that survives from earlier epic. Aeneas presents an instructive and disquieting contrast to Dido and Turnus. The furor with which he reacts to the sight of Helen in Book 2 and to the death of Pallas in Book 10 is entirely spontaneous and in character. In the former instance he is saved from whatever impiety his madness had conceived by the intervention of Venus; in the latter no divine curb is placed upon his vengeful fury, which is most brutally exposed not in the catalogue of slaughter in Book 10 but in the manner of Turnus's death at the end of Book 12. Moreover he has constant need of divine encouragement and exhortation. Hector's commission to him is quite forgotten until Venus's urgent warning (2.619 f.); the Penates rescue him in Crete from a disaster that he shows no resource in overcoming; it is only the arrival of Jupiter's ambassador Mercury that prises him away from Dido and Carthage and only the ghost of Anchises, again sent by Jupiter, that persuades him to complete the last part of the journey from Sicily. Not much of an heroic ideal in all this save in one important respect: it is Aeneas's pietas that enables him to respond appropriately to the divine initiatives and to overcome those elements in his character, not all of them violent or ignoble, that stand in the way of duty, and so to emerge as the prototype of a dis- tinctively Roman form of heroism. One last topic remains to be considered. The lofty seriousness of the theodicy that on the above interpretation underlies the whole divine participation in the narrative is on a number of occasions dangerously undermined by the anthropomorphic realism with which the gods are portrayed. When Juno sets about raising the storm in Book 1, she bribes Aeolus in typically Homeric (or for that matter Ovidian) fashion by promising him the fairest of the nymphs Deiopea (65 ff.). When the storm finally penetrates the consciousness of Neptune (124 ff.), he reacts just like a Roman magistrate who has been affronted by some intrusion upon his prouincia, declaring 'non illi (sc. Aeolo) imperium pelagi saeuomque tridentem / sed mihi sorte datum'. This realistic piece of r00orolda, re- inforced by the famous simile of the orator quelling an unruly mob (149 ff.), belittles the dignity of the intervention. Similarly Juno's reaction to Aeneas's welcome by Latinus (7.308-10) has the petulant tone of a patrician lady who, finding herself outwitted by some social inferior and unable to enlist any sympathy from her peers, resorts in desperation to the criminal underworld to find an agent for her spite: 'magna louis coniunx ... uincor ab Aenea ... flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta mouebo'.</page><page sequence="21">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 163 It might be objected that such a criticism concedes too little to the conventions of the genre. But we can judge Vergil against himself. Venus's request to Neptune (5.779 ff.) for safe conduct of the Trojan ships and his response to her are both free of the overdrawn anthropo- morphism that elsewhere impedes our suspension of disbelief. What could have seemed a whimsical intrusion by the deities is presented as an event consistent with divine dignity, with Venus's permanent role in the poem and with Neptune's past behaviour. The double-dealing between Juno and Venus in 4.90 ff. has often provoked unfavourable comment. It is not just that the goddesses are depicted as if they were two rivals in comedy striving to outwit each other; but the noble Dido is in the process reduced to a pawn in an unnecessarily squalid game. Indeed it says much for Vergil's poetic talent that he is able in spite of this to establish the queen as a great tragic heroine. The most egregious instance of frivolous anthropomorphism comes much later, in the seduction of Vulcan (8.370-406). The Homeric precedent, Thetis's request for arms from Hephaestus (II. 18.368 ff.), is appropriately emphasized (383-4). Venus's task is of course more delicate; for she is pleading with her husband, on behalf of the son of one of her adulterous escapades. So what we get is a scene more reminiscent of Hera's seduction of Zeus in II. 14.153 ff. or Demodocus's amusing tale of Ares and Aphrodite in Od. 8.266 ff. The spectacle of an adulterous beauty-queen calculatingly turning her charms on a long- suffering husband would have delighted Callimacheans - even Ovid could not have done it better - but its mix of domestic comedy and vivid sensuality gravely detracts from the seriousness of the surround- ing narrative. Evander has just taken leave of Aeneas with the lofty moral advice: 'aude, hospes, contemnere opes et te quoque dignum / finge deo rebusque ueni non asper egenis' (364-5). Immediately after comes the splendid description of the night shift in Vulcan's workshop and the production of the monumental shield (407 ff.). Even Jupiter's crucial intervention in Book 4 is strangely motivated. He seems to be careless, if not actually ignorant, of what is going on between Aeneas and Dido until the angry torrent of prayer comes up from larbas (198 ff.). Thereupon 'oculos ... ad moenia torsit / regia et oblitos famae melioris amantis' and Fate is swiftly brought back on course. Again we can compare Vergil with himself. In Book 11 no human prayer is needed to prompt Jupiter to act: 'at non haec nullis hominum sator atque deorum / obseruans oculis summo sedet altus Olympo' (725-6). For the epic tradition of course there is nothing un- toward in the idea that gods have now and then to be coaxed or chivvied into acting their parts; nor would popular piety in Vergil's day have</page><page sequence="22">164 THE GODS IN THE AENEID found anything alien in larbas's prayer and its sequel. Nevertheless the notion of a divine superintendent of Fate who is not wholly self- directing but needs on occasion to be activated by human information and entreaty does detract from a serious view of the theodicy of the poem. In short the gods of the Hellenized literary-religious tradition, im- mortals of superhuman powers but with all the frailties of character that belong to their human creators, were not capable of bearing the serious burden of causation that Vergil placed upon them. Better to have swept away all the divine personalities and replaced them with more abstract beings, which could represent the mysterious forces operating in the physical and mental world for and against the success of Aeneas's mission, and above these, ultimately setting the limits to their interaction and directing the overall course of events, Fate itself, conceived in something like its Stoic form. This would have been a revolutionary step in a genre where anthropomorphic gods and modes of divine intervention in human affairs were so firmly installed; but it would also have been a reversion to something like the older Latin concepts of deity (see n. 6 below). The revolutionary step was in fact taken by Lucan, and it may not have been just his Stoic convictions or the incongruity of importing divine machinery into recent historical events that led him, while filling his poem with sacrifices, portents, and the sense of super-natural forces constantly pressing on human events, to omit the conventional divine machinery altogether. NOTES 1. In the proem to the Iliad the only explicit reference to divine forces is z6i 8' rEAELETro /ovA5 (5), in the Odyssey /3ovi 'Y-rEplovog 'HEALoto (8). At the start of Argonautica there is no hint whatever that the human events in Apollonius's narrative are closely and continually linked to divine actions and initiatives and the first reference to a deity, to Athena's role in the building of the Argo (18-19), is almost casual. 2. In the Latin tradition there was ample precedent in Naevius (BP 13, 16, 21 Marmorale) and Ennius (A 22, 175, 291, 457 Vahlen). See J. Perret, Virgile (Paris, 1965), p. 132. That the status-conferring role of the gods was essential even to epic poems on recent historical subjects is clear from Cicero's practice of introducing into his autobiographical epic pieces a concilium deorum and a long address by Urania to the poet (ad Q. fr. 3.1.24, Div. 2.17). Serious doctrine thus lies behind the satiric context of Eumolpus's assertions in Petron. Sat. 118: 'non enim res gestae uersibus comprehendendae sunt, quod longe melius historici faciunt, sed per ambages deorumque ministeria et fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus ut potius furentis animi uaticinatio appareat quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides'. 3. On the divine ingredients in Livy's history see W. Liebeschuetz JRS 57 (1967), 45 ff. 4. As in our reaction to the ghost of Hamlet's father or to the statue of the Commendatore in the final act of Don Giovanni. There is a clear contrast with the incidental use of divine activity as a metaphor of physical events, e.g. Bibaculus's 'interea Oceani linquens Aurora cubile' and 'Iuppiter hibernas cana niue conspuit Alpes' (Macrob. Sat. 6.1.31, Quint. 8.6.17). Both the dramatic effect and the status conferred by such images are independent of belief in the gods. 5. Otherwise the divine machinery merely ensures that the story is kept at a distance from reality, within the region of fantasy. See K. F. Quinn Virgil's Aeneid: a critical description (London, 1968), p. 305 for precisely this view of the gods here.</page><page sequence="23">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 165 6. After a discussion of the heavenly bodies (54) and the deification of natural products - Ceres, Liber (60), functional abstractions - Fides, Mens etc. (61), and human benefactors - Hercules, Castor etc. (62). The Fides group has Greek parallels of course, but it was characteristic of primitive Roman religion to proliferate such deities, defined precisely by their prouinciae (a practice ridiculed in Aug. Civ. Dei 4.21) but otherwise quite vaguely conceived (cf. Varro ap. Serv. in Georg. 3.1 on whether Pales was male or female). They were therefore unsuited to pictorial or poetic elaboration, unless like Cupido or Fortuna they were personified in the Greek fashion. 7. Jupiter is the universal father who helps (iuuat) all his children; Juno also the 'helper', the atmosphere between earth and heaven; Venus the procreative desire that comes (uenit) to all creatures. The Penates dwell in the penetralia of the home, their name derived from the food store (penus), etc. Etymologies were as important for the Stoics as for Plato and usually just as fanciful. 8. Cf. Lucretius's explicit use of Bacchus and Ceres (2.655 ff.) and the introduction of Venus into the proem, inspired by Empedocles's use of 'Appo8o&amp;7r for his creative principle ptAodr`T (Simplic. Phys. 158.24), as the personification of the creative process by which concilia of atoms are formed. 9. Protests to this effect were as old as Xenophanes (Sext. Math. 9.193), whose anti- anthropomorphism (Clem. Strom. 5.109.3) was, however, not total (Sext. ibid. 144, Simplic. Phys. 23.20). 10. Cicero elsewhere says explicitly 'at hoc quidem commune est omnium philosophorum ... numquam nec irasci deum nec nocere' (Off. 3.102). 11. 'pietate ac religione atque hac sapientia quod deorum numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus omnis gentis nationesque superauimus', Cicero boasted on a public occasion (Harusp. Resp. 19); '... nostrae ciuitatis quae numquam profecto sine summa placatione deorum im- mortalium tanta esse potuisset', declares even the sceptical pontifex maximus Cotta in N.D. 3.5. 12. Especially topical for the Augustan reader were the ceremony of the temple gates of Janus (7.601 ff.) and the ara maxima of Hercules (8.185 ff.). 13. No doubt a feature of Hellenistic KTUiTL epics; cf. Callim. Aet. 2.75-83 Pf on the religious legends about the origin of Zancle. For Apollonius see J. U. Powell Coll. Alex. 4-8. But the blend of secular and sacred was so fundamental to Roman political institutions that the com- bination of Homeric divine machinery and Roman cult must have been prominent already in Naevius and Ennius. 14. Cic. N.D. 2.6; cf. Liv. 2.20.12. 15. The quasi-scientific rules governing divination, which enabled them to be assimilated to more rationalized theologies like Stoicism, distinguished the two groups very sharply: portents were interpreted by the highly systematized diuinatio artificiosa; dreams, which were significantly grouped with furor uaticinantium and thus more closely related to the condition of ivovocaaaL6o, were the subject of diuinatio naturalis (Cic. Div. 1.11, 34 etc., with A. S. Pease's commentary). 16. Lines 987-8; cf. Nisus's words to Euryalus (Aen. 9.184-5): 'dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt, /Euryale, an sua quoique deus fit dira cupido?', followed a couple of lines later by the forthright 'mens agitat mihi'. This is not a clue to Vergil's concept of the gods' role in events but part of his characterization of Nisus, to be set beside, for instance, the agnostic tone of 'Iuppiter aut quicumque oculis haec aspicit aequis' (ibid. 209). 17. Equated in classical times with 'Eacra and the tLEydAOL OEoL of Aegean religion (see nn. 21, 22), they are more likely to be indigenous cognates than derivatives of these. 18. The incident illustrates the fragile boundary between internal and external phenomena. Hector appears in a dream to Aeneas but the sacra that he passes to him belong to the external world and are thereafter carried by the hero wherever he goes. By contrast the theophany of Venus, 'aetherios inter ... nimbos / dona ferens' (8.608 ff.), though private to Aeneas, is an external event, the visit of a mother to her son. Hence the reality of the arms given to him poses less difficulty; but the incident is correspondingly harder to demythologize than either the Hector-dream or even the appearance of Venus to Aeneas at 1.314 ff. 19. Dido also has her Penates (1.704); so has Evander (8.123), and the early morning sacrifice made jointly by Evander and Aeneas to the local Lar and Penates (8.543) underlines their association with the intimate hospitality to strangers in the home. That their precise function was uncertain is clear from Cicero's brief account of them (N.D. 2.68). 20. The difficulty of reconciling in somnis (151) with nec sopor (173) already troubled ancient</page><page sequence="24">166 THE GODS IN THE AENEID readers, as Servius's note shows. Perhaps it is an indication that Aeneas himself, who is telling the story, was uncertain. 21. That their identification was debated in classical times is clear from Macrobius (Sat. 3.4.6-13), who cites (1) Nigidius's opinion that they were Trojan versions of Apollo and Neptune, both of whom appear independently in the Aeneid; (2) Varro's opinion that they were originally from Samothrace and that 'qui diligentius eruunt ueritatem Penates esse dixerunt per quos penitus spiramus, per quos . .. rationem animi possidemus'. (3) Hyginus's view that they were OEol 7rarp4~o0 'gods of our ancestors' or 'of our fatherland' (cf. patriosque Penatis at 2.717). In the aedes deum penatium on the Velia, which was restored by Augustus (R.G. 19, 36), they were depicted as two seated youths in military dress, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (A.R. 1.68), who like Varro identifies them with the Samothracian FLEydAoL OEoL, i.e. the Kafrlpot. Moreover, there is evidence in coinage of the 1st century B.C. to suggest that this iconography owed something at least to the Dioscuri; see R. B. Lloyd, AJPh 77 (1956), 38 ff. 22. The line-ending magnis dis is Ennian (A 201 V). It is not clear whether the magni di are here distinct from the Penates (cf. magnos ... penatis at 9.258). Macrobius (loc. cit. n. 21) cites the view of Cassius Hemina that the di magni were the Samothracian OEol /iEydAoL and then adds 'eosdemque Romanorum penates proprie dici OEobs tLEydAovs', citing Aen. 3.12, which he presumably understood as 'and with the Penates, the great gods'. It has been conjectured that dis magnis was actually inscribed upon the statue of the Penates in the Velia temple. See R. D. Williams Aeneidos Liber Tertius (Oxford, 1962), pp. 54-5. 23. The indigenous Neptunus was defined solely by his prouincia (cf. n. 6), as was Portunus - 'deus portuum portarumque praeses' (Varro ap. Schol Ver. Aen. 5.241; cf. Cic. N.D. 2.66) - who is also assigned to a Trojan context (5.241). 24. Nautes owes his skill as a counsellor explicitly to Tritonia Pallas (5.704). 25. This Italian cult is, however, carefully linked to the Greek Artemis by the strange tale of Hippolytus's resurrection. 26. Hence her brother Apollo's rejection of the second part of Arruns's vow at 794-8. 27. Cf. Poseidon's hostility to the Greeks during and after the Trojan War, aggravated by Odysseus's treatment of Polyphemus (Od. 1.68 ff.). 28. The Olympian action at a distance in both instances is typical, and it is an oversimplification to interpret the two agents Allecto and Iris as 'scarcely more than a personification of Juno's suffering' (Michael C. J. Putnam, The Poetry of the Aeneid (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), p. 88). 29. J. Perret, op. cit. p. 131, plausibly suggests that in the traditional version of the story Turnus was indeed motivated by plain jealousy, as the Latins were by resentment towards the alien usurpers. 30. An Italian Achilles, also born of a goddess (6.89-90; cf. 9.742, 10.76), with a distinguished human pedigree (7.56), including an Argive connection (371-2). Subsequently we learn of his outstanding physical prowess (783 ff.) and his piety (9.23-4, 10.620; cf. 7.438-9). Every detail combines towards a re-creation of the Homeric ideal hero, to set against the Vergilian Roman ideal embodied in Aeneas. 31. The line describing the actual intervention, 'Irim de caelo misit Saturnia Iuno' (9.2) echoes - again significantly - the descent of Iris to the Trojan women at 5.606, from a context where the goddess's machinations were frustrated. 32. It would be interesting to apply the external/internal interpretation of divine interventions used in the present study to these and other passages in Homer. 33. Who later provides explicitly the content of the simile describing Aeneas's first glimpse of Dido (498 ff.). 34. There is a precedent in the Odyssey, where Telemachus's despondency is abruptly ended by his encounter with the disguised Athena (1.113 ff.) and he assumes a confidence and maturity that amaze even his own mother (360-1) as well as the suitors (381-2). 35. 567-88 contain enough unusual features of style and language to justify the suspicion that they are, as they stand, not Vergilian but rather the work of an early interpolator (presumably prior to Lucan 10.59), one of the many (Suet. Vita = Donatus Praef. Buc. 41) who were unable to resist the challenge of the uersus imperfectos in the poem. However, the content of the passage is surely an astonishing choice for an interpolator to have made, unless he had some evidence of Vergil's intentions. The whole of this section of the poem still awaited its final revision at Vergil's death, as</page><page sequence="25">THE GODS IN THE AENEID 167 witness the half-lines at 468, 614, and 623, and it may reasonably be conjectured that Vergil had left enough lines and fragments (there are many phrases that certainly sound authentic scattered through the suspect passage) to leave his intentions clear. The disconcerting picture they gave of the hero would have made Varius grateful to have the excuse of their fragmentary character for excluding them from his edition. The same considerations would explain why the passage as we have it, cobbled together from the poet's disiecta membra, was not admitted into the authorized version that is reflected in the manuscript tradition of the poem itself and in the abundant citations of the Aeneid in the grammarians, but surfaced only in Servius's preface to his commentary and in the Servius Auctus note on 566. For a detailed discussion of the passage and a very different conclusion see G. P. Goold, HSCP 74 (1970), 130-68. R. G. Austin's view of the passage, Aeneidos Liber Secundus (Oxford, 1964), pp. 217 ff., is close to the one proposed here, though not all Austin's interpretations of detail are acceptable; e.g. sceleratas (576) is indeed 'a piece of self- condemnation', the judgement of Aeneas the narrator on Aeneas furens (595). 36. infelix in 712, as elsewhere, probably has both the senses 'barren' and 'ill-fated'. Dido had borne Sychaeus no children. At 4.327-30 she refers poignantly to the fact that, though she and Aeneas have lived together as husband and wife, she is not pregnant. This is significantly rare, if not unique, in classical myth and legend, where it is normal for even a single act of sexual intercourse to produce offspring. 37. Iulus-Ascanius thus plays a crucial part in both the beginning and the end of the affair. 38. B. Otis, Virgil: a Study in Civilized Poetry (Oxford, 1964), p. 226, sees Jupiter's interference as an external parallel to the stirring of Aeneas's conscience; but this reduction of Vergil's divinities to something like their Apollonian role ignores the subtle detail of the Vergilian narrative. 39. Otis op. cit. p. 94 rightly sees amor andfuror as threateningpietas andfatum, but in imposing this antithesis on Dido and Aeneas respectively he reduces them to Morality personae and diminishes the essential tragedy of their relationship. 40. See R. D. Williams, op. cit. p. 134. 41. Prompted by the continuing strife between the goddesses, it is a far cry from the serenity he showed (1.254 ff.) in comforting the despairing Venus. V. P6schl, Die Dichtkunst Virgils: Bild und Symbol in der Aeneis (Innsbruck, 19773), pp. 16 ff., makes altogether too much of that serenitas. For it is only one facet of Jupiter's character, as it is of the Roman ideal that P6schl seems to regard the god as symbolizing allegorically. Not for nothing did Jupiter wield the least serene of punitive weapons (1.230); on occasion he could exhibit as much saeuitia as Juno (cf. 1.4 with 11.901). 42. By contrast in tuorum fata (1.257-8) and fatis contraria nostris /fata Phrygum (7.293-4) the genitives and nostris are all 'objective', viz. 'the fate that has been assigned to your people' etc. 43. The construction of the sentence is odd. Helenus can hardly be forbidden by Juno to divulge what he has been barred from knowing. So we must either understand something like etiam si sciret withfari ('Juno forbids him to speak, even if he did know') or take -que twice over, first as coordinating prohibent and uetat and then scire and fari ('The Fates prevent Helenus and Juno prohibits him from knowing and speaking the rest.') 44. Cf. the Stoic definition of r-u'X as ~58,iAo a'la dvOpwrr ivq Aoytaaw? (Stob. Ecl. 1.7.9). A good illustration is Palinurus's use offorte (6.349) in describing his own death, which, he does not know but we do, has been contrived by a god. 45. The classic Stoic posture of resignation; cf. Sen. Ben. 2.18.8: 'ducunt uolentem fata, nolentem trahunt'. 46. In fact Fortuna represents the impact of Fate, for prosperity or the reverse, upon those who are affected by it but cannot comprehend the broader providential plan. 47. The phrase is from Tac. Ann. 6.22, where a view of Fate (probably Stoic) is cited that leaves us with electionem uitae but, once our choice is made, commits us to certum imminentium ordinem. We may choose our role in the drama but the part is already written and we cannot conjecture much of its content in advance. 48. Cf. the doctrine that magna di curant, parua negligunt (Cic. N.D. 2.167), where di is virtually synonymous with Fatum. Unlike the more austere concepts of Fate this doctrine did leave some freedom of action to the individual, provided of course that he was left unmolested by divine forces. 49. It is not clear whether Aeneas's attribution of the prophecy to Anchises (7.122-3) is a mark of the unfinished state of the poem or a subtle indication from the poet that the hero's memory of his early wanderings is still dominated by his father.</page><page sequence="26">168 THE GODS IN THE AENEID 50. The phrase again is from R. D. Williams; The Aeneid of Virgil Books 7-12 (London, 1972), p. 432. 51. More typical is the god's motivation of another Etruscan captain to attack Camilla's forces: 'Tarchonem in proelia saeua/ suscitat et stimulis haud mollibus inicit iras' (11.727-8). For here there is no suggestion that if left to himself he would have joined the battle at this moment. 52. The ambiguity is very potent, for instance, in Venus's irate question to Jupiter (10.34-5): 'cur nunc tua quisquam/ uertere iussa potest aut cur noua condere fata'? 53. Perret, op. cit. p. 130, follows Boissier in seeing ira lunonis as causing all the important incidents in the poem, but this ignores the love affair at Carthage. P6schl, op. cit., regards Juno first (p. 14) as the mythological personification of the historical power of Carthage. This could certainly apply to Ennius's Juno (see A. 291 V, cited by Servius on 1.281). But it accords ill with Vergil's account of Juno's reconciliation to Rome's illustrious future (12.827), which would leave the other addressees of Dido's famous prayer (4.607-10) with the task of implementing its demands (622-9). Nor does Jupiter's reference to the future wars with Carthage (10.11-15) necessarily imply Juno's involvement. Later (p. 17) P6schl converts the goddess into a divine symbol of the demonic forces of violence and destruction. But the violence she is responsible for comes from her opposition to Fate and is far from being her monopoly in the poem. For Otis, op. cit., p. 309, Juno is the external stimulus corresponding to and exciting the inner response; this seems once again to reduce the deity to Apollonian redundancy. 54. Likewise Vergil's contemporaries the elegists continued to fill the gap in the aetiology of love with the traditional gods of erotic literature: the lover who acts unpredictably and out of character is afflicted with dementia, insania, the result of being vanquished and possessed by Venus or Amor. 55. The view that the gods of the Aeneid were allegorical figures of psychological phenomena, symbols that the reader decodes as he goes along, was first and most influentially elaborated by R. Heinze, Virgils epische Technik (Stuttgart, 19143), pp. 291-318. NOTES ON CONTRIBUTORS SHIRLEY A. BARLOW: Senior Lecturer in Classics, University of Kent at Canterbury.
