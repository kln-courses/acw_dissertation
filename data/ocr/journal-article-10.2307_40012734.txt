If nothing can be prior to the acts of choice by which values and life-policies are adopted, then we see that religion is completely human, bound up with the cultures and the histories that it creates. Ordinary folk may think my- thologically that their religious beliefs express timeless and objective truths, but specialists know that every last detail of every religion is human, evolved in human societies and having a purely human history that can in principle be reconstructed. In the past those who came to see that reli- gion is just human became themselves non- religious. Today this is no longer the case. The first conscious believers are appearing, people who know that religion is just human but have come to see that it is no less vital to us for that. Religion has to be human; it could not be otherwise, for it would not work as religion unless it were simply human. Don Cupitt If one reads The Holy Family, the first work in which Marx and Engels co- operated, one comes across the following enthusiastic passage (which was written by Engels): Who then has discovered the secret of the 'system'? Feuerbach. Who has destroyed the dialectic of concepts, the war of gods, the only one the philosophers knew? Feuerbach. Who has put, not indeed the definition of man' - as though man could have a definition other than that he is a man - but 'man' in place of the old rubbish and also in place of 'infinite self- consciousness? Feuerbach and Feuerbach alone} It was the same Engels who wrote upon the appearance of Feuerbach's Essence of Christianity in 1841 that</page><page sequence="2">104 The spell was broken: the 'system' was shattered and thrown aside, the contradiction resolved: for it existed only in the imagination. No one can have an idea of the liberating influence of this book unless he himself experienced it. Enthusiasm was general: we were all for the moment 'Feuerbachians' ? And in a letter which he wrote in 1843 Marx himself praises Feuerbach's account of miracles, and commends him to his contemporaries in the most laudatory terms: To you, speculative theologians and philosophers, I give this advice: free yourselves from the concepts and prejudices of previous speculative phi- losophy if you wish really to discover things as they are, that is if you wish to discover the truth. And there is no other way to truth and freedom than through the 'river of fire'.3 Feuerbach is the purgatory of the present time.4 This lionisation of Feuerbach may strike the modern reader as more than a little puzzling, since he is not usually represented as a major figure in the history of Western thought, and is indeed usually remembered, if at all, as the philosopher who came in for critical comment at Marx's hands in the latter's famous Theses on Feuerbach. In the first instance then, my task here is to show just why Feuerbach was held in such high regard by his fellow 'Young Hegelians', by Marx and Engels, and why his work merits much closer examination than is typically extended to it today. 1 Feuerbach's whole thought is dominated by a single idea - that of religion. As he put it himself in 1848, 'All my writings have only one aim, one design, one object. This is precisely religion, theology and anything connected with them'.5 And he had earlier written to his father that 'I wish to press to my heart nature, from whose depths the frightened theologian shies away, and man, the whole man, not man as dealt with by the theologian, anatomist or lawyer, but as object of philosophy'.6 The phrases 'nature' and 'the whole man' in this context are of funda- mental importance, for they serve as general indicators of Feuerbach's philo- sophical antecedents, as well as pointing to the direction in which his thought was to develop. For while he was for a time an enthusiastic Hegelian, and, indeed, brilliantly adapted the Hegelian dialectic of consciousness as a frame- work for expressing his own most fundamental insights into the nature of both religion and philosophy, he nevertheless become progressively more and more disenchanted with the tendency, implicit in all forms of speculative philoso- phy, to reduce human existence to thought, and to lose any genuine perspec- tive on the functional multiplicity and multidimensional complexity of human</page><page sequence="3">105 nature. It is precisely this multidimensional complexity, as concretely em- bodied in 'the whole man', that Feuerbach seeks to investigate and analyse; religion as a social and trans-cultural phenomenon became the focal point of his philosophy primarily because he felt that the central and most character- istic manifestation of human nature is to be found in religious consciousness. Feuerbach's point of departure, then, is with a critique of traditional phi- losophy. For Feuerbach critical philosophy, as he conceived it, would take the form of a rigorous and sustained effort to achieve human self-understanding and would therefore be a highly-evolved form of anthropology. Traditional speculative philosophy, he held, is a hidden and self-deceiving mode of human self-understanding: it conceals its truly human subject matter behind a veneer of metaphysical obscurities, it rarefies and abstracts, both con- ceptually and methodologically, until even the most vestigial elements relat- ing to human nature are systematically obscured. Where traditional specula- tive philosophy lays claim to abstract truth in a realm of abstract essences, Feuerbach sees this as 'nothing but' an intellectually perverted form of the conceptualisation of human nature and human consciousness. When tradi- tional philosophy is thus demythologised, its positive, human content becomes manifest once more, and it is recognised as the anthropological project which it truly is, at which point it 'dissolves' and becomes transformed into the study of human nature and the intellectual elaboration of the very conditions of human life itself. The achievement of such a 'dissolution' or transformation of philosophy was one of Feuerbach's primary ambitions. Yet this is but part of the story. For the mythologisation which is so central to traditional philosophy, which makes it appear to be concerned with matters other than human nature, is but an extension of the distorting mystification by theology of religious consciousness, in which human nature, and our awa- reness of that nature as a species-nature which we share with others, finds its most characteristic expression. For Feuerbach, what marks man off from the brutes, as he himself puts it, is precisely our awareness of ourselves as species-beings, which is not simply an additional fact of which we are aware: it is rather recognition which qualitatively changes the very nature of human consciousness itself. The fundamental relation for Feuerbach, as for Hegel, is the subject-object relation, and Feuerbach's model of self-conscious awareness is taken directly from Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit: con- sciousness is intentional, hence to be conscious at all is, of necessity to be conscious of something. In reflexive self-consciousness, the process in which the conscious subject contemplates his own nature, this nature presents itself as intentional object, as something which is 'other than', or is external to, the self. It is, in fact, the 'otherness' of the self which is paramount in the dialectical confrontation which constitutes self-awareness. Thus for Feuerbach the I-Thou relationship is central to the processes of self-awareness and of</page><page sequence="4">106 self-knowledge - it is only through this apparent 'Thou', which is in reality human nature externalised and reified, that the ego or self can be appre- hended and understood. Unlike Hegel, however, Feuerbach insists that this 'I-Thou' dialectical duality has an existential or ontological counterpart, in the distinction between the individual human being and the species of which he comes to recognise himself to be a member. The achievement of full self-consciousness is therefore for Feuerbach the achievement of the recognition of others as being species-identical with the self; it is at one and the same time attainment of recognition of the individuality and actuality of the self and of the generality and infinite potentiality of the species. Now the attainment of this kind of recognition, which is so integral to the process of human self-awareness and self-knowledge, is a highly complex procedure, from both the epistemological and psychological points of view. Further, it is a two-fold process: we first have to gain mastery of the range of physical, psychological and normative concepts which typically apply to human beings as individuals and to the human species as a whole; we then have to learn the limits of the boundaries of application of this range of concepts. And since the former task invariably precedes the latter, our initial tendency is to go beyond the legitimate boundaries of application of the concept-range, and to misapply our human-being concepts. Thus a child relates to its environment at large most readily through a process of personification - in storybooks and in school text-books the child's interest, attention, and above all, its understanding are engaged through the attribution of anthropomorphic qualities to non-human objects and organisms: bees worry, trees are sad, ants are curious, and so on. But for Feuerbach the most systematic mode of misapplication of human-being concepts is in religious consciousness as mediated by orthodox theology. There the initial price is paid for the appearance of human nature in reflex- ive self-awareness in the aspect of the 'Thou' or 'other-than-self, in that this 'other-ness' is taken as indicating a transcendental rather than a pheno- menological relationship, with a consequential hypostatisation of the attrib- utes which characterise the species. The true subject-matter of religion then, for Feuerbach, no less than philosophy, is human nature - religion is a rudi- mentary form of man's awareness of himself as a species-being, and is therefore by virtue of that a primitive anthropology. It follows from this, of course, that the real difference between religion and philosophy is one of degree rather than of kind: correctly understood, both are forms of anthro- pology, and have as their proper function the elaboration and exploration of human nature. But just as traditional philosophy loses sight of the real, full-blooded man by mythologising and progressively abstracting its own subject-matter, so too theologically-mediated religion relinquishes the rel- ative concreteness of the species-concept and replaces it with that of a per-</page><page sequence="5">107 sonified being onto whom it projects the qualities properly relating to the species as a whole, thus severing, in order to misrepresent, the link between the existent individual and his objective nature. In fact, for Feuerbach the process of 'mystifying' or 'mythologising' human nature begins with the- ology, with the projection of human species-attributes onto an abstract, but personal, being called 'God', and is continued by philosophy, which switches the projection from 'God' to 'Nature', and finally to that ultimate metaphys- ical abstraction, 'Being'. This is why Feuerbach holds that 'God' and 'Being' are abstract images of the human species-consciousness - for him the human species-nature is precisely what in religious and metaphysical contexts is taken as 'God' or 'Being'. This is the key to an understanding of Feuerbach's assertions that 'the secret of philosophy is theology' (i.e. philosophy is an esoteric or abstract form of theology) and that 'the true sense of theology is anthropol- ogy' (i.e. theology is an esoteric or abstract form of anthropology).7 Since the inversion is greater in speculative philosophy than in theology, Feuerbach considered it the more harmful of the two, and his critique of philosophy is sustained and powerful; as I have already mentioned, the reduction or trans- formation of philosophy into anthropology (which he considered to be the returning to philosophy of its true, undistorted nature) remained a life-long ambition with him. But it is to theology, and to religious consciousness as mediated by the- ology, that he devotes most of his critical attention, partly because he took religion very seriously, and wished to do full scientific justice to it, and partly because he recognised that religion and theology have a social and a cul- tural significance which in magnitude greatly exceeds that of philosophy. Indeed, he leaves no room for doubt as to what his principal objective is: he wished, he said, to change the friends of God into friends of man, believers into thinkers, worshippers into workers, candidates for the other world into students of this world, Christians, who on their own confession are half-animal and half-angel, into men - whole men, theologians into anthropologians, . . . religious and political footmen of a celestial and terrestrial monarchy and aristocracy into free, self-reliant citizens of the earth.8 Thus The Essence of Christianity, the work for which Feuerbach is best remembered to the present day, and which evoked the highly laudatory comments from Marx and Engels which I have already cited, is a sustained and comprehensive statement of Feuerbach's anthropological analysis of religion and theology, which also contains a metacritique of speculative phi- losophy itself. For Feuerbach was not content merely to condemn traditional philosophical speculation, he also sought in pratice to effect a reduction of philosophy to theoretical anthropology. This is one of the factors which</page><page sequence="6">108 makes him such a provocative and controversial writer, and which, to no small degree, shapes the arguments of The Essence of Christianity. And this is a consideration I wish to emphasise in my evaluation of that work. My objectives here are three-fold: (a) In the first place, I am deeply con- scious of the fact that the central idea upon which the book is based, that the concept of God is an anthropomorphic projection of the human mind, and as such embodies man's conception of his own nature, was neither original to Feuerbach nor new - it was articulated clearly by Xenophanes and Lucretius in antiquity, and by Spinoza in the seventeenth century, and this is fre- quently presented as a reason for taking Feuerbach less seriously then his work, in my estimation, merits. While conceding totally that the idea which governs much of Feuerbach's work is not original to him, I wish to show, by concrete exemplification, that this is no way detracts from his achievements, which spring from the power and the subtlety of his application of this governing idea, and by his clear articulation of its philosophical relevance.9 (b) In the second instance, it seems to me that a major element in Feuerbach's projectionist programme is missed or is simply passed over by most con- temporary commentators - specifically, his account of the normative nature of the anthropomorphic attributes in terms of which God is conceived in religious thought, and to his ancillary reformulation of the orthodox account of the relationship between religion and morality. I wish, in some small way, to correct this imbalance in contemporary Feuerbachian exegetics by placing some emphasis on the primacy of this latter theme in Feuerbach's work. For Feuerbach, I wish to show, is important not merely as the pioneer of scientific empiricism, humanism and social materialism in post-Hegelian European philosophy, he is also a moral philosopher of the first rank. (c) Finally, I wish to critically evaluate Feuerbach's projectionist programme by reference to an approach to religion and religious belief which, it can be argued - though the point is by no means uncontroversial - is suggested by the work of Wittgenstein, and more explicitly by that of his followers. In this connection I will endeavour to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the power, cogency and persuasive force of Feuerbach's arguments, they are, in the last analysis, based upon presuppositions which are fundamentally mis- conceived. II Marx Wartofsky describes The Essence of Christianity as, quite literally, a 'shocking work'.10 Yet Feuerbach does not set out to shock or outrage - he even indignantly repudiates the claim that his position is atheistic. His chief concern, indeed, his obsession, is to reveal the true nature of God and of religion; he denies the reality of God, not in any absolute sense, but as a</page><page sequence="7">109 being which is considered to have an existence apart from the species- nature of man. As Karl Barth puts the matter, We misinterpret Feuerbach if we see in [his philosophy] a depreciation of religion and theology: it is the essence of man that he emphatically and enthusiastically affirms, against theology and idealistic philosophy. When he identifies God with the essence of man, he thereby pays God the highest honour that he can confer; indeed, this is the strange Magnificat that Ludwig Feuerbach intones for "the good Lord".11 This, in my view, is substantially correct, and I think that Barth is also right in arguing that Feuerbach is simply too important a figure to be ignored - for much too long he has suffered the ignominious consequences of being treated as a minor transitional figure between Hegel and Marx, and his own pivotal contributions to philosophical anthropology, to the philosophy of culture, and his metacritique of philosophy itself have been extended only the most superficial of treatment. And this is despite the fact that his radical critique of theology has been rapaciously assimilated by radical theology itself, as a means of preserving the significance of God for modern man; despite the fact that the concept of alienation, as formulated by him, was to become the pivotal concept in subsequent existentialist thought, and despite the fact that his account of the 'I-Thou' relationship was to be taken over by existentialists such as Sartre, Marcel, and Buber as the key to an under- standing of the relation of self to other. The structure of the Essence of Christianity reflects Feuerbach's recogni- tion that he is addressing two separate, though closely related, issues: there is the question of what religious consciousness reveals about the nature of its subject-matter, and the question of how this is revealed, and how it becomes distorted by theology. Accordingly, the book is divided into two parts: the first, 'positive' part (with which I shall be almost exclusively con- cerned here) deals with The True or Anthropological Essence of Religion', considering religion as a rudimentary but 'alienated' form of human self- awareness; the second, 'negative' part deals with The False or Theological Essence of Religion', considering theology as a further theoretical distortion of man's self-conception. The framework within which Feuerbach's thesis is developed, it is clear from the outset, is the Hegelian dialectic of consciousness. In our conscious- ness of empirical objects, he asserts, we do, because we must, distinguish between the conscious subject and the object of which it is conscious; in religion, however, such a distinction is impossible, because self-consciousness and consciousness of the religious object are identical. This is why, in Feuerbach's view, belief in God is such an extensive, if varied, trans-cultural phenomenon - it is the certainty of the existence of the individual human being, and of his species-nature. Thus, Feuerbach asserts, 'consciousness of</page><page sequence="8">110 God is self-consciousness, knowledge of God is self-knowledge. By God thou knowest the man, and by the man his God'.12 This is not to suggest, of course, that the religious person recognises that this is the case; on the con- trary, Feuerbach holds, 'ignorance is fundamental to the peculiar nature of religion'.13 Just as the child comes to grasp the concept 'humanity' by en- countering it apart from himself, in others, and subsequently subsumes him- self under this concept by recognising himself as in individual member of the general class which it designates, so too in religion, Feuerbach argues, man comes to apprehend the essential nature of his species as if it existed apart from all men - his own subjective nature is seen by him as if it were an external object. There is development in religious awareness, however, and this consists in the recognition that what, in a more primitive religion, was regarded as divine, is in fact human; as he puts it, 'What was at first religion becomes at a later period idolatry; man is seen to have adored his own nature.'14 The adherents of a particular religion at any given time will readily see that this is so in relation to other contemporaneous or earlier religions, but will in- variably presuppose that this is not the case in relation to the religion which they themselves profess; Feuerbach for his part sees it as his task to show that the misapprehension of the human for the divine is common to all reli- gions, and is particularly true of Christianity. Thus he affirms that It is our task to show that the antithesis of divine and human is altogether illusory, that is nothing else than the antithesis between the human nature in general and the human individual; that, consequently, the object and contents of the Christian religion are altogether human.15 His thesis, then, is in essence this: religion is the most fundamental, but also the most rudimentary, form of human se/f-awareness and, accordingly, of spedes-awareness, but the individual-species distinction is misapprehended in religion as a distinction between the individual and God. Thus he holds that 'The divine being is nothing else than the human being, or rather, the human nature purified, freed from the limitations of the individual man All the attributes of the divine nature are, therefore, attributes of the human nature.'16 Feuerbach next proceeds to analyse the logical relationship which obtains between subject and predicate, in order to argue that whatever holds true generally of the predicates of any subject, of necessity holds true of the subject itself. Feuerbach is here clearly adopting a quasi-phenomenalist stance - for him the subject is, ontologically speaking, equivalent to the sum of the attributes which are predicable of it, for it only by means of these attributes that the subject can be individuated. It is within this framework that he advances his anthropomorphic account of God. Once it is admitted</page><page sequence="9">Ill (as, he maintains, it must be admitted) that the predicates ascribed to God, e.g. divine love, justice, mercy, knowledge, power, etc. are anthropomorphic in nature, then only 'faint-heartedness and intellectual imbecility'17 can pre- vent us from concluding that God himself is anthropomorphism: If thy predicates are anthropomorphisms, the subject of them is an anthro- pomorphism too. If love, goodness, personality, &amp;c, are human attrib- utes, so also is the subject which thou presupposest, the existence of God, the belief that there is a God, an anthropomorphism - a presupposition purely human.18 Why then are these attributes ascribed to God? Feuerbach's answer - in a sense, the very heart of his thesis - is explicitly projectionist: Thou believest in love as a divine attribute because thou thyself lovest; thou believest that God is a wise, benevolent being because thou knowest nothing better in thyself than benevolence and wisdom; and thou believest that God exists, and that therefore he is a subject . . . because thou thyself existest, art thyself a subject.19 The question then arises as to why the religious consciousness makes the mistake, as Feuerbach sees it, of distinguishing, in the manner in which it does, the divine subject from the divine predicates, i.e. of treating the ques- tion of the existence of God as if it were distinct from the question of the nature of God, when in fact the two are part of one and the same question. Feuerbach's answer is that the mistake occurs because human existence seems to be a necessary precondition for the possibility of possessing human attributes', that is to say, I must exist in the first place if I am to have proper- ties such as size, shape, temperament, etc. - the latter seem accidental to me, in the sense that I might have existed and have had a different shape, size, temperament, etc., but my existence would have been nonetheless real for all that. As he puts it, 'To exist is to man the first datum; it constitutes the very idea of the subject; it is presupposed by the predicates'.20 Here again we encounter his quasi-phenomenalism - the distinction between sub- ject and predicate is a logical or conceptual rather than an ontological or metaphysical one; the subject is, as stated earlier, merely the sum of the attributes which are predicable of it. Apart from these attributes there is no subject. Thus, 'The predicate is the truth of the subject - the subject only the personified, existing predicate, the predicate conceived as existing'.21 In other words, while it is true that I might have existed and have had attributes other than those which I do in fact have, I clearly could not have existed without having any attributes at all Thus the existence of any entity and its possession of attributes are necessarily connected; the distinction between the entity which exists, and its attributes, is merely a conceptual one. We are therefore frequently misled into thinking that we can accept</page><page sequence="10">112 that the predicates which we ascribe to God are anthropomorphisms, while denying that God himself, the subject, is an anthropomorphism, because we mistake this conceptual distinction for an ontological one. In reality, the truth is very different; as Feuerbach puts it, The necessity of the subject lies only in the necessity of the predicate. The certainty of the existence of God depends only on the certainty of the qualities of God. The reality of the predicate is the sole guarantee of existence.'22 Thus the certainty of God's existence hinges on the reality of the divine attributes - in this sense God unquestionably exists, and we may be certain of his existence, because the divine attributes are real - they are the essen- tial attributes of man: 'How then can I doubt of God, who is my being?', asks Feuerbach rhetorically, To doubt of God is to doubt of myself.'23 This equation of man and God, this identification of God with human nature, is absolutely fundamental to Feuerbach's thesis, with, of course, the qualifica- tion which was mentioned earlier, viz. that the religious individual is not aware of the fact that in asserting the existence of God he is apotheosising human qualities. This enables Feuerbach to advance an account of religious change and development which is congruent with his general thesis. Religion, in the very broad sense of a complex nexus of belief, practice and ritual, is invari- ably deeply rooted in the cultural consciousness of any given society - it is, indeed, one of the most characteristic social manifestations of culture. And since the values and mores of any social grouping are, in a very definite sense, quite specific to it, it follows that these mores will, at least in part, shape and determine the nature of the socially dominant conception of God.24 But a given man's perception of himself, and of human nature as such, is condi- tioned, as is his perception of everything else, by the intellectual and moral environment in which he lives and with which he must come to terms. This environment is never quite the same from one culture to another, and for this reason man's conception of God, and, what for Feuerbach amounts to the same thing, his conception of himself, varies greatly: 'God, or, what is the same thing, religion, is as various as are the conditions under which man conceives this his nature, regards it as the highest being'.25 What does not vary, however, it should be noted, is the fact that God is necessarily con- ceived of in terms of the attributes which a given society holds in high esteem, or which occupy a lofty place in the hierarchy of values shared by the community - this link between moral norms and religion is, again, quite fundamental to Feuerbach's thought. What should be noted at this stage is the nature of this relationship as Feuerbach conceived it; his point is not the orthodox one that moral norms are derived from religious principles, but rather the converse - our moral framework or set of values itself determines our conception of God.</page><page sequence="11">113 The development of religion, according to Feuerbach, shows in itself the artificiality of the distinction between the divine subject and divine predi- cates; in fact, he argues The progressive development of religion is identical with the progressive development of human culture . . . With the emerging of man from a state of savagery and wildness to one of culture, with the distinction between what is fitting for man and what is not fitting, arises simultaneously the dis- tinction between that which is fitting and that which is not fitting for God.26 It is essential that we be clear about what is involved here: Feuerbach is pointing out that it is most emphatically not the case that we derive our value-systems by reference to a transcendental God-given standard, rather we morally evaluate attributes in their own right before we ascribe them to God. Our moral norms determine our conception of God, our very religion, not the other way around. And insofar as, in asserting God's existence, we are actually affirming the reality of certain moral attributes or properties, then we may say that God does, indeed, exist. But we must understand that we are saying this, rather than affirming the existence of some 'being' or other. And this, Feuerbach argues, is precisely what the religious person fails to recognise. This brings us to what, in my opinion, is the most impor- tant implication of Feuerbach's theory: Not the attribute of the divinity, but the divineness or diety of the attri- bute, is the first Divine Being. Thus what theology and philosophy have held to be God, the Absolute, the Infinite, is not God; but that which they have held not to be God is God: namely, the attribute, the quality, what- ever has reality.27 It should be noted that there is an asymmetrical relation here: the 'negation' or denial of the divine predicates is equivalent to a denial of the divine subject, although this is frequently not recognised; but a denial of the divine subject, such as Feuerbach's, is not equivalent to a denial of the divine pred- icates. As he puts it, In no wise is the negation of the subject necessarily also a negation of the predicates considered in themselves. These have an intrinsic, independent reality; they force their recognition upon man by their very nature It does not follow that goodness, justice, wisdom, are chimaeras because the existence of God is a chimaera, nor truths because this is a truth.28 On this criterion, it should be observed, Feuerbach himself is not an atheist, for atheism is the denial of the objective reality of the moral attributes which, in religion, are ascribed to God, and Feuerbach is very far from wishing to make any such denial. On the contrary, he asserts that 'He alone is the true atheist to whom the predicates of the Divine Being, - for example, love, wisdom, justice, - are nothing; not he to whom merely the subject of these predicates is nothing.'29</page><page sequence="12">114 We are in a position to see now just why Feuerbach spends so much time on the subject-predicate distinction: (a) He wishes to point out that it is a logical, rather than an ontological distinction; (b) He wishes to contend that the existence of God (or of anything else, for that matter) can be asserted only through and by means of His properties; to say that God exists is to say that the properties which define God have instances (or one instance) in the world; (c) He wishes to argue that the religious individual mistakes the logical distinction between subject and predicate for a real or ontological distinction, and is so misled into the misconception of admitting that the properties of God are anthropomorphisms, while denying that the divine subject is an anthropomorphism. Feuerbach for his part argues that God (or any other logical subject) is simply the sum total of his properties - if the latter are anthropomorphisms then God himself is an anthropomorphism; (d) The anthropomorphic qualities which characterise God are specifically moral in nature - God is not merely a projection of the human mind, He is a projection of those qualities which are highly valued by the human commu- nity or cultural grouping which does the projecting; consequently, if we wish to determine the system of values which a given society (say, the ancient Greeks, Romans, or Germans) espoused, we need only look to their concep- tions of God or gods, and to their religious practices, and we shall find our answer there; (e) This is because any society's conception of God is a func- tion of the moral value-system of the society concerned, a fact which indi- cates that morality is logically prior to, and independent of, religion; (f) The true atheist, then, for Feuerbach, is one who does not value the good for its own sake, but rather because he believes that it has been ordained by the projected and fictitious subject, God, for such a person must accept that, in logical consistency, he would have deemed any action good if it had been been ordained by God. The genuine theist, on the other hand, is the man who values the good whether it has been ordained by God or not. Indeed, once this is recognized, the question: 'Has this action been ordained by God?' becomes totally superfluous, and the autonomy of morality is clearly established. It is in the context of these considerations that Feuerbach asserts that the 'religious individual' misconstrues not only the species-nature of man (which he mistakes for God), but also the relationship which obtains between reli- gion and morality. For such a person believes in a divine subject, and a moral law, and for him the former is a necessary precondition for the latter; the latter makes no sense without the former. But in reality, he argues, the situation is reversed, 'The fact is not that a quality is divine because God has it, but that God has it because it is itself divine: because God without it would be a defective being.'30 What determines God are predicates, and in particular moral predicates.31 Thus in order of priority the latter precede the</page><page sequence="13">115 former - God is God only insofar as he possesses these moral attributes, which are, of course, anthropomorphic in nature. For these reasons Feuerbach summarises his work with the assertion that We have reduced the otherworldly, supernatural and superhuman essence of God to its particular foundations in the essence of man. Thus we have in the end arrived back at our starting point. Man is the beginning of reli- gion, Man is the centre of religion, Man is the end of religion.32 Ill In the foregoing I have endeavoured to make it clear why Marx and Engels greeted Feuerbach's writings so enthusiastically, and why Marx should have described Feuerbach's work as constituting the only theoretical revolution since Hegel. Indeed, Marx's intellectual indebtedness to Feuerbach is quite enormous: he transferred Feuerbach's critique of religion to the spheres of economics and political philosophy, and borrowed from Feuerbach the idea that man is 'the foundation of the state', since he is essentially a communal being who 'accomplishes himself in and through his species-nature. Even the central themes in Marxism of the humanisation of nature and of the nat- uralisation of man are derived from Feuerbach. But it is clearly beyond the scope of this paper to trace Feuerbach's influence upon Marx in any detail, and I certainly would not wish to be interpreted as suggesting that Feuerbach's importance resides in the fact that he did have such an influence upon Marx. I wish rather, in conclusion, to comment on the way in which Feuerbach's thought should be assessed and evaluated. In the first place, I think that it is important to see that Marx was right in specifying that Feuerbach effected a theoretical revolution in philosophy, and to see the crucial implication of this: that, notwithstanding the factual tones adopted by Feuerbach in the Essence of Christianity, he is, in the final analysis, offering us a theory - even if he is granted his claim that his phi- losophy is a form of anthropology (which is certainly contestable, at the very least), it is, one would have to insist, theoretical rather cultural anthropology. Secondly, it is my view that the most fundamental question which needs to be addressed by anyone seeking to pronounce a verdict upon Feuerbach's work is not directly that of the adequacy of his theory per se, as might be assumed, but rather the presuppositions upon which it is based. In this context it must be observed that Feuerbach's determination, which is sustained throughout this work, to treat religion in a theoretical and scientific manner, without once questioning the validity of this approach to religion and to religious beliefs, has to be regarded as problematic. To be precise, his most fundamental, albeit unstated, presupposition is that reli- gion consists of, and is therefore analysable into, a series of factual claims</page><page sequence="14">116 and beliefs, which are associated with essentially utilitarian practices, not- withstanding the fact that he saw as clearly as any philosopher before or since has that the claims of religion have an absoluteness and an inviolabil- ity about them which no factual claims could possibly have. Thus, for example, he observes in the second part of The Essence of Christianity that Religion annexes to its doctrines a curse and a blessing, damnation and salvation. Blessed is he that believeth, cursed is he who believeth not. Thus it appeals not to reason, but to feeling, to the desire of happiness; to the passions of hope and fear. It does not take the theoretical point of view, otherwise it must have been free to enunciate its doctrines without attaching to them practical consequences, without to a certain extent com- pelling belief in them; for the case stands thus: I am lost if I do not believe As in religion the highest idea, the highest existence is God, so the highest crime is doubt in God, or the doubt that God exists. But that which I do not trust myself to doubt, which I cannot doubt without feeling disturbed in my soul, without incurring guilt; that is no matter of theory, but a matter of conscience, no being of the intellect, but of the heart.33 Yet, strangely, notwithstanding this, Feuerbach persists in his treatment of the question of God's existence as if were a purely factual matter which can be addressed theoretically, and simply assumes or presupposes that the state- ment that 'God exists' is a straightforward existential claim, and that talk about God is talk about an entity or being of a particular kind. This is a pre- supposition which, I think it is fair to say, many people, whether they are religiously-minded or otherwise, would share with Feuerbach. Yet it is pre- cisely this presupposition, in my view, which needs to be questioned. From the work of the later Wittgenstein and his followers a radically dif- ferent view of the nature of religious belief and practice has emerged: the view that religious discouse is constituted of a language-game or series of language-games in which concepts such as 'God' and 'immortality' pre- dominate, and which in turn rest upon the form of life (the shared commu- nal experiences, customs and mode of social integration) which underpin them and give them their specific content.34 On this view, such language- games constitute and determine the fundamental frame of reference in terms of which the believer evaluates the world, but they themselves cannot be evaluated other than by criteria which are internal to them.35 This way of looking at religion represents it as a complex of human activities such as prayer, worship, adoration, reflection, etc. which is governed by internal rules, and sees it as constituting a universe of discouse, possessing interconnect- ing threads linking it to others in human life, which has its own standards of rationality, intelligibility, and coherence.36</page><page sequence="15">117 Ironically enough, this mode of comprehending religious belief and prac- tice was, in part, inspired by Wittgenstein's recognition that religious belief is, as Feuerbach observed, non-theoretic in nature. As he puts it, in a state- ment remarkably reminiscent of Feuerbach's observation about the non- theoretic nature of religious conviction and belief, If the question arises as to the existence of a god or God, it plays an entirely different role to that of the existence of any object I ever heard of. One said, one had to say, that one believed in the existence, and if I did not believe, this was regarded as something bad. Normally if I did not believe in the existence of something no one would think that there was anything wrong in this.37 In other words, belief in the existence of God cannot possibly be construed as belief in the existence of a thing or being; to express one's belief in God is to express one's faith, one's mode of perceiving and evaluating the world. The believer, then, is one to whom the activities of prayer, worship, adora- tion, etc. are meaningful and appropriate, and to whom discourse about divine 1 anger, mercy, the immortality of the soul, and the day of Judgement, is sig- nificant. Religious beliefs are not hypotheses or theories about what might be the case; for the believer they have an absolute character - it is incon- \ ceivable to him that they could be mistaken. And yet it is not possible to mark this off as a distinction between belief and knowledge - we do not normally speak of 'religious knowledge' (even when we ourselves share the relevant beliefs), and with good reason - the concept of 'knowledge' has no logical purchase in such contexts.38 On this account then, the believer is one who can meaningfully participate in the form of life which we call 'religion' \ - he is one to whom the activities of prayer and worship are important and meaningful, whereas the non-believer is cut off from this form of life. He may well indeed be aware of its existence, but meaningful participation in it is not for him a possibility. This view also demonstrates that Feuerbach puts an erroneous construc- tion on the use of anthropomorphic terms in religious language. It is of course true, as a straightforward matter of empirical fact, that such anthro- pomorhisms are an integral part of religious discourse - thus to speak of God's justice, mercy, anger, etc. is incontestably to utilise terms which have ] their primary application to human beings. And Feuerbach's emphasis on the significance of the normative nature of the predicates ascribed to God is perspicuous and enlightening. But his uncritical acceptance of the assump- tion that religious discourse is factual in nature, which may be assessed in purely theoretical terms, blinds him to the nature of the web of logical inter- connections which obtains between such terms in religious discourse, and to critical differences which exist between it and that which obtains between</page><page sequence="16">118 these terms in their use in factual discourse. An illustration from Wittgenstein brings out this point very clearly: 'God's eye sees everything', I want to say of this that it uses a picture [In saying this] I meant: what conclusions are you going to draw? etc. Are eyebrows going to be talked of, in connection with the eye of God?39 In other words, while talk about human eyes is internally related to talk about human eyebrows, such that, in general, the preconditions for the pos- sibility of one are eo ipso preconditions for the possibility of the other, nothing remotely like this holds true of religious discourse about God's eye (or mercy, anger, judgement, etc.). Thus from the fact that anthropomorphisms predomi- nate in religious language, i.e. that, in Feuerbach's terminology, the predi- cates which are ascribed to God are anthropomorphic in nature, it does not follow that God must necessarily be conceptualised as a transcendent, anthro- pomorphic being - to argue thus, as Feuerbach does, is in effect equivalent to insisting that talk about God's eyebrows is a necessary and legitimate I corollary to talk about God's eyes.40 An associated point is that Feuerbach falls into the classical trap, spec- ified so graphically by Wittgenstein in the opening passages of the Investi- gations, of assuming that the central (if not indeed exclusive) use of language is its descriptive use, and thereby fails to take cognisance of the multiplicity of non-descriptive uses to which it may be put, in religious discourse and ritual, as in other dimensions of human life. Yet these latter are characteris- tic of much of religious discourse - one thinks in this context of the lan- guage of worship, celebration, prayer, exhortation, commitment, etc. These are just some of the language-games which, collectively, constitute religion as a form of life, and it would be an absurdity to suggest that Feuerbach was not aware of their existence. Indeed, it is salutary to see so rigorous, honest and critical a thinker as Feuerbach, consumed as he was with a burning passion to do full scientific justice to the phenomenon of religion, rendered utterly blind to its most distinguishing features by his uncritical acceptance of the 'word-object' paradigm of meaning, and of a presupposition about the nature of religious discourse which, on the face of it, seems to be unex- ceptionable, if not indeed obviously true, but which turns out, on closer examination, to be quite false. In the final analysis then, and at the deepest level, Feuerbach's analysis of religion, however enlightening it may be in particular respects, is seriously misguided. Religion is, as he clearly saw, a fundamentally important and in- triguing human phenomenon - and he was surely right in stressing the cen- trality of man himself to this phenomenon - but it is a gross misconception to think that religion can be understood by the literal application to it of standards of rationality which are pertinent and appropriate for purely factual</page><page sequence="17">119 discourse. As a form of life, religion can rather be comprehended only in terms of the internal logic which governs it, and which both sets it apart from, and determines points of interconnections with, other forms of life.

This position, which has become known as 'Wittgensteinian Fideism', is not without its critics - on the contrary, indeed, the debate surrounding it is both heated and controver- sial. Cf. K.

It is obviously beyond the scope of this paper to make a formal contribution to this debate, but it is worth pointing out that numbered amongst its critics are those who, precisely because they repudicate the sui generis account of religious discourse offered by the Wittgensteinian Fideists, find atheism inescapable. Cf. in particular K. Nielsen, op. cit., passim, and A. Flew, God and Philosophy (Hutchinson, 1966). 37. Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief ed. C.

One talks of believing and at the same time one doesn't use 'believe' as one does ordinarily. You might say (in the normal use): "You only believe - oh well ..." Here it is used entirely differently; on the other hand it is not used as we generally use the word 'know'.' 39. Ibid., p. 11. 40. This is not to deny, of course, that God is very frequently conceptualised in this manner, by those, for example, who would insist upon his existence as a personal being. It should be evident from the foregoing that those who would reject the Wittgensteinian sui generis account of religious discourse in favour of such a 'personalist', anthropomorphic account would have to offer a response to Feuerbach's critique which would differ radi- cally from that articulated in this paper.
