<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Arabic Literature, VI NIGHT AND SILENCE Experience and Language in Romanticism and Mysticism I "Does not everything that inspires us wear the colour of Night?" asks Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis, 1772-1802) in the fourth of his Hymnen an die Nacht.1 Romantic poetry is, in a sense, a prefigura- tion of a nocturnal sensibility, which, as in Harold Bloom's reading of Shelley's "To Night", "links Night and imaginative life, the life of the poet which cannot be lived in the common day." 2 In this sense romantic poetry has meaning "only by allusion to an intuited Night." 3 Some of the elements which enter into the making of the nature of this Night may here be described by reference to a number of Arabic and Western poems. The longest, and perhaps the best, of these poems is Novalis's Hymnen. There are some similarities between it and Jubran's prose-poem Ayyuhd al-layl ("O Night").4 I ... Yet away I turn away (from daylight) to the holy, ineffable, myste- rious Night .... Gladly terrified I behold an earnest face which bends to me softly and devoutly, and beneath infinitely tangled locks it shows a Mother's dear youth .... More heavenly still than those flashing orbs, seem to us the infinite eyes which Night hath opened within us .. .; unneedful of the light, they glance, through the depths of a loving heart which fills a higher space with unutterable delight .... II ... For light its time was measured out; but timeless and spaceless is the reign of Night.-Eternal is the duration of sleep .... IV ...

Night became the mighty bosom of revelation; into it the gods returned.

You are darkness that makes us see the lights of heaven, and the day is light submerging us with the darkness of earth. You are hope that opens our spiritual eyes before sublime infinity, and day is vanity that stays us in the world of measurement and quantity. In your shade the poet's emotions stir, on your arms the prophets' hearts awake, and among your locks thinkers' minds vibrate. You are he who teaches the poets, inspires the prophets and encourages thinkers and meditators. When my soul was bored of the human race, and my eyes were wearied of looking at the face of the day, I walked away to those remote fields where the shadows of ancient times sleep .... There I saw you, 0 Night, sublime and beautiful, standing between the earth and the sky .... There I saw you, 0 Night, and you saw me; in your sublimity, you were to me a father, and in my dreams I was to you a son, and so the curtains of forms were drawn away from between us, and the veil of doubt and speculations was rent, from our faces; you made your mysteries and inmost desires mine .... (Jubrdn) Like Novalis, Jubran depicts his initiation into the sacred, inexpres- sible life of Night, and apprehends Night as a living anthropomorphic deity sympathetic to him, protecting him under his mantle and reveal- ing to him the spiritual secrets of eternal inspiration. As for Novalis, "more divine than [daylight] are the 'eyes' opened within him by [N]ight. This [N]ight-sense is not dependent on light (that is, it is a spiritual, not a physical power), and it penetrates depths which light cannot reach." 5 The Night is a cosmic source of the self, an innocent authentic identity. It is the pure and dark source of meta- physical knowledge and unity, which the poet, identified with the Night, can perceive only in an act of mystical intuition.

The point of intersection is the Night-poem, the making of which, whether in Novalis or in Jubran, is the making of the Night. It is a mutual process in which the Night and the poem create each other. In the Night of the creative mind only the visionary faculties are at work. 16 i ;1J 5j JJ 9 Li jcr1 , I?j :.-J 4j) 4jW11 JIZ j.-JI 91.1 wo LS 1 jd~ x I v , I I GC _? 1 W3 iZ,JIIa The Night surrounds the Poet; the physical eye cannot see. The room with the hearth is the mind in creativity. The lightning and the thunder are the voices and visions from the heart of the Night. Only by some sort of mystical intuition, or inner illumination, does he perceive reality.6 Indeed, the spiritual significance of the Night reached a similar intensity in the writings of some medieval Muslim mystics. In his Kitdb al-mawdqif (The Book of Spiritual Sayings) al-Niffari writes: 7 He stayed me in the Night, and said to me: When the night comes to thee, stay before Me, and with thy hand lay hold of ignorance, and by it turn from Me the knowledge of the heavens and the earth; and when thou hast turned, thou shalt see me descending. 6 Ghurfat al-shdcir ("The Poet's Chamber"), Diwdn 'A/i Mabmud Taba (Beirut, 1972), pp. 38-39. 7 The Mawaqif and Mukhdtabat of Muhammad Ibn cAbdi 'I-Jabbdr al-Niffari, edited, with translation, commentary and indices, by A.

In another place, he describes his heavenly Night-journey (isra') as "a vision, not of sight [the physical eye] but of insight [the spiritual eye] (ru!yatjandn Id 'iydn)." 9 Ibn 'Arabl's model is issat al-isrd' wa al-mi'raj of the Prophet's own Night-journey, which is one of the main sources of the holiness of the Night in Islamic mysticism. The Sudanese poet Al-Tijani Yuisuf Bashir (1911-1937), who was educated in his family's long tradition of Islamic Sufism, was un- doubtedly acquainted with the mystic significance of the Night. But being a keen reader of Apollo, which was one of the main sources on which he depended for his knowledge of European poetry, he was also most probably acquainted, as will soon be shown, with al-Dahshan's translation of de Musset's les Nuit.10 His nocturnal poem Fi 'l-maukd 11 ("Where Inspiration Is") has grown out of the .sufi as well as the romantic realms of the Night: JWlAJI *9 Mi &gt;1,91 4j0 J J;9 i ,l; I, rA1 I J r, XL ok a.w dSo 9 J ;S, . .~ . ~ J~ .99 @2@ 1?

Yet, in his crystalline poem, which exhibits better craftsmanship and a more subtle poetic mind than de Musset's translator, al-Tijani uses mystic diction extensively; e.g., sahbwdn and sdkir, wajd, nashwd and fayd, haymdn and dhakir. But these words, as used in the poem, are drained of their strictly religious associations in Islamic mysticism and charged with a fresh significance relative to the aesthetic experience described. Similarly, al-Maubd, from al- Waby, which is the Quranic word for the Prophet's religious inspiration embodied in the Holy Book, is used to signify poetic inspiration. Al-Tijani's is a "prophet of emotions (nabby al-mashdlir)", that is, a romantic poet. II An intimate relationship links Romanticism and mysticism, although in Romanticism the centre of gravity has shifted from the religious to the aesthetic. This shift in emphasis is crucial. It provides the only perspective in which the similarities and differences in the manner in which mystics and romantics experience reality, and in the language in which that experience is expressed, can be viewed. The concept of the creative imagination, central in romanticism and mysticism, both European and Arabic, provides an adequate point of departure. The theoretical formulation of this concept in Arabic romantic criticism is, to a large degree, based on principles borrowed from English romantic theory. To anticipate what will be discussed soon, one may claim an indigenous philosophical back- ground to this concept in the neo-Platonic tradition as assimilated in Islamic philosophy. As is shown later in this essay, there is evidence that Arab romantic poets were aware of an intimate relationship between their vision and that of their predecessors, the sufi-mystics</page><page sequence="6">112 NIGHT AND SILENCE of Islam; that relationship was never defined or investigated in detail by the romantic theoreticians of the creative imagination. It was only hinted at. The writings of the Andalusian Muhyi '1-Din Ibn (Arab! (1165-1240) integrate many Greek, Christian and Islamic Iranian and Arabic sources into a comprehensive and detailed theory of the imagination -both divine and human. In verse, he stated this as follows: 12 But what does this mean? According to him, God has created the universe by imagining it in an act of eternal "theophanic Imagination" in which He Himself is "manifested". "To the initial act of the Creator imagining the world", explains Henry Corbin in his masterly L'Imagination creatrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi,13 "... corresponds the creature imagining his world, imagining the worlds, his God, his symbols .... [M]an's Active Imagination cannot be a vain fiction, since it is [the] same theophanic Imagination which, in and by the human being, continues to reveal what it showed itself by first imagining it." In this intimate reciprocity of the active and the theophanic imagina- tion, the opposites-the self and the world, the human and the divine-are reconciled. Ibn 'Arabi endowed the imagination with "the function... which it alone can perform; namely, the function of effecting a coincidentia oppositorum (jam' bayn al-naqkdqyn)." '4Corbin rightly emphasizes Ibn 'Arabi's thesis that "man must experience the human Imagination as an energy responding to the same creative need, the same creativity ['of the God manifested by the theophanic Imagination'].15 "This manifestation," he explains further: 16 "... is neither perceptible nor verifiable by the sensory faculties; discursive reason rejects it. It is perceptible only by the Active Imagi- nation (Ha.drat al-Khayal, the imaginative 'Presence' or 'Dignity', the Imaginatrix) at times when it dominates man's sense perceptions, in dreams or better still in the waking state (in the state characteristic of 12 M.

In short, a mystic perception (dhawq) is required. To perceive allforms, as epiphanic forms (ma;Jhir), ... is precisely to effect the encounter, the coincidence, between God's descent toward the creature and the creature's ascent toward the Creator." "An intermediary, a mediatrix: such is the essential function of the imagination," 17 as perceived by Ibn 'Arabi. Though the relationship between this and the romantic concept of the imagination is intimate, it was not explored by the Arab romantics. There are few references that might be taken as an in- dication that there was some, if vague, awareness of the existence of such a philosophical relationship. In the introduction to his one act play Mafraq al-tariq (1938) Bishr Faris uses traditional Islamic sflf terminology to elucidate his romantic-symbolistic aesthetics. In an article published in al-Muqtataf in 1945, he does the same thing in relation to poetic language. For him, the suifis were romantic-sym- bolists.'8 Abud Shad! defines poetry, rather vaguely, as "a mystic spirit, that is, in the first place, a disseminating responsive emotion; its diction and music are themselves part of this mystical spirit." 19 In an article entitled Shi'r al-tafawwuf20 ("The Poetry of Mysticism") by a contributor to Apollo, mysticism is said to have "a philosophy of far-reaching imagination... (which is) mostly expressed in poetry." Mystical and romantic poetry, observes the contributor, have deep affinities between them. Mystical poetry, he says, expresses the knowledge of: "the realities of the soul and other spheres (of being) and their hidden mysteries ... This aspect (of it) is indeed left out of scholarship in Arabic literature; yet it deserves to be studied and to be compared to similar aspects in other literatures, because some of it is closely similar to de Musset's les Nuits and Tagore's lyrics." In al-Khayal wa atharuhfl 'l-.aydt 21 ("Imagination and Its Effect in Life"), an article by the romantic critic-poet Mustafa A. al-Saharti, the mystic/romantic affinity is again emphasized. The article draws on Coleridge's Biographia Literaria and Louis Berg's The Human 17 Ibid., p. 189. 18 Kalimat al-sbdcir, al-Muqta.taf, Vol. VI, no. 4, April 1945, pp. 362-374. 19 Apollo, Vol. II, no. 3, November 1933, p. 174. 20 Apollo, Vol. II, no. 2, October 1933, p. 142-146. 21 Al-Siydsah, supplement to no. 3394, 14 April 1934, pp. 10-11. 8</page><page sequence="8">114 NIGHT AND SILENCE Personality. Creative imagination, it is argued, is the source of dreams, myths, legends and symbolism. "Manifestations of these pure dreams," he says, "may often appear in the waking state in the mystics and artists. Ibn cArabi, 'Umar Ibn al-Farid (for example), used to ex- perience states of ecstasy and spiritual transport to the higher realms of existence (ufuq al-wujfid) in [their] visionary moments." Not only Muslim, but also Christian Arab Romantics found in their heritage of Islamic mysticism a source of inspiration. This is particularly clear in the Christian Mahjar poets, immersed as they were in a Western Christian milieu in the United States. "the line of reading which Naimy (i.e., Mikht'll Nu'aymah) followed swung from Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism and other theosophies of the East, to Plato, St. Augustine, Savonarola, Spinoza and innumerable similar devotees ... in the West, not failing, of course, to bring him back home again to al- Hjallaj, Ibn cArabi and various other similar-minded figures in the Moslem Arab heritage." 22 Nu'aymah "could see from his reading how the same line [of thought] was continued and kept alive through such figures as Emerson and Thoreau," and in some aspects of the "mystical implications of 19th century German Idealism and of the English Romantic movement." 23 Similarly, Jubran believed that al-Ghazzali and St. Augustine were "two vistas of one belief." "In the writings of Spinoza and William Blake. ..," he could feel "some of his [i.e., al-Ghazzali's] passion." In another place, he expresses his admiration for Ibn Sind's poem on the soul which begins: &amp;J Lbj ,&amp;u j !u19 v9 .~ and suggests that some of its lines could be compared to some thoughts and images of Shakespeare, Shelley, Goethe, and Browning; and in another short monograph he paid tribute to Ibn al-Fdrid.24 What is important in these observations made by the Arab romantic poets is not the accuracy concerning the details of the philosophical relationship between mysticism and romanticism, but the passion for the continuity of the tradition. There is no contradiction, they 22 Nadeem N. Naimy, Mikhail Naimy: An Introduction (Beirut, 1967), p. 109. (My italics). This topographical survey of Nu'aymah's readings, says the author, "is based on private interviews and on an inspection of his library at home in Baskinta (f.n.)". 23 Loc. cit. 24 Jubran, op. cit., pp. 536-539, 532-535, 555.</page><page sequence="9">NIGHT AND SILENCE 115 believed, between what they intimated in this traditional source and what they borrowed from other sources, namely European roman- ticism. The relationship between romanticism and mysticism is not unique to Arabic poetry and critical theory. A similar relationship exists between European Romanticism and the tradition of Christian mystical thought-mainly that of the theosophists of the Renaissance. A modern interpreter of the doctrines of Boehme and Paracelsus indicates this relationship in terms of the concept of the imagination, central, as has been argued, both to Romanticism and mysticism. "The notion of the imagination," he observes, magical intermediary between thought and being, incarnation of thought in image and presence of the image in being, is a conception of the utmost importance, which plays a leading role in the philosophy of the Renaissance, and which we meet again in the philosophy of Romanticism.25 For example, Coleridge, the foremost English Romantic theore- tician of the concept of the imagination, has emphasized in many places in his writings the importance of mystics, especially Jacob Boehme, in the making of his mind: [T]o have passed them [i.e. the mystics] over in an historical sketch of my literary life and opinions would have seemed to me like the denial of a debt, the concealment of a boon. For the writings of these mystics acted in no slight degree to prevent my mind from being imprisoned within the outline of any single dogmatic system. They contributed to keep alive the heart in the head; . . . they were always a pillar of fire throughout the night, during my wanderings through the wilderness of doubt.26 "All Schelling had said," reports H. Crabb Robinson, "[Coleridge] had thought out for himself, or found in Jacob Boehme." 27 "The exact nature of his debt to this German mystic," as J. B. Beer says, "forms a particularly thorny problem." 28 What Beer suggests about the nature of this debt is sound. "[W]here an image or a sentiment in Boehme found an echo in the shapings of his own imagination," he comments, "it was eagerly taken up into the pattern, and valued for the hint of external confirmation which it offered." 29 26 Alexandre Koyre, Mystiques, Spirituels, Aichimistes du XVIe siecle allemand (Paris, 1955), p. 60.

Beer, Coleridge the Visionary (London, 1959), p. 60. 29 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="10">116 NIGHT AND SILENCE But Coleridge was also "disciplined", in his own words, by the writings of Kant 30 and, taking the risk of simplification, by what may generally be called the philosophical background of romanti- cism, mainly Spinoza and Berkley and even the associationist tradition of Locke, Hartley and Priestly. 31 However, the point to be made here is that Coleridge's thought was fed not only by the mystical tradition in the West, but also by the more formal discipline of pre- romantic and contemporary Western philosophies. The fact that such a background of an immediate philosophical discipline did not exist for Arabic romanticism, may explain why the Arab romantics attached, consciously or unconsciously, such an importance to the Islamic theosophical tradition. Though one may be cautious not to over- emphasize this point, that tradition may be said to have provided the philosophical ground for the romantic concepts of the intuitive perception of reality, the relationship between the self and the world and the theory of poetic imagination. Indeed, the period between the Wars witnessed a revival of sufi-mystical thought as a philosoph- ical discipline.32 III The preceding discussion about the relationship between roman- ticism and mysticism does not assume that this relationship is one of identity. There are certain similarities; but there are also essential differences. The main difference may be stated precisely as follows: the primary concern of the mystic is religious; that of the romantic is aesthetic. This may sound obvious; yet it is very important. The mystic interprets reality according to God's terms; the romantic poet in terms of his own poetic self. "This means," argues Paul Tillich, the modern German theologian-after briefly indicating "the line of [mystical] thought coming from the early Renaissance... and going into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries" 33--that Romantic philosophy replaced religion by aesthetic intuition. When- ever you find the statement made by artists or in works of art that art is religion itself, you are in the sphere of the romantic tradition .... 30 Biographia Literaria, Vol. I, p. 99. 31 See, for example, Richard Hawen's article, "Coleridge, Hartley and the Mystics," Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. xx, no. 4, 1959, pp. 477-494. 32 See cAdil al-'Awa's bibliographical survey of tasawwuf writings since the middle of the 19th century in al-Fikr al-falsafifi mi'at sanab, AUB Arabic Studies (Beirut, 1962), pp. 298-359. 33 Paul Tillich, Perspectives on 19th and 20th5 Century Protestant Theology, ed.

Braaten (London, 1967), p. 78.</page><page sequence="11">NIGHT AND SILENCE 117 Aesthetic intuition as participating intuition takes art seriously as revelatory.34 The romantic intuitive perception of reality may, in this sense, be described as aesthetic mysticism. Both the mystic and the romantic are concerned with the sacred, the holy, the divine in the world and in human experience. But, on the one hand, the mystic believes that the divine "is the centre and the periphery of everything. [God] is in everything as the [centre], although He transcends everything; but He is also the periphery because He embraces everything. They are removed from Him and at the same time He is in them." 35 For a depth psychologist like C. G. Jung, this definition of God becomes, simply, a definition of the Self.36 As an expression of the Self, (ro- mantic) poetry "is at once the centre and circumference of knowledge; it is that which comprehends all science, and that to which all science must be referred." 37 This well known statement by Shelley was picked and translated into Arabic as early as 1915 in al-Mazini's unpublished notes for his intended voluminous book on "the phi- losophy of literary criticism" which he never wrote. A detailed study of the European metamorphoses of the geometric image of the circle from the Renaissance to the twentieth century, as the one undertaken by Georges Poulet, reaches the conclusion that for Romanticism "Man is... simultaneously [centre] and circle: [centre] by the active principle of his thought, circle by the infinite content of it." 38 This is also true for Arabic Romanticism.

Poetry (and art in general) is the miracle or magic by which this re-creation is accom- plished. Romanticism is an inverted mysticism in which inspiration comes from within, not from without, the creative human conscious- or, indeed, subconscious-mind. Earl R. Wasserman has pointed out that in his translation of the Ion, Shelley attempted intermittently to transform that Platonic doctrine into the more manageable idea of intuition: "by divine influence (OLoc)," for example, becomes "from the impulse of the divinity within [the poet]." 43 Inspiration and expression are thus made synonymous for the romantic poet who perceives transcendental reality in terms of psychic depth. To go back to the Night prolegomena of this essay, it is possible now to remark that, for the mystic, the Night-as a dark eternal elemental source-is the Night of the Mysteries of God; "the darkness of Himself" (Z/mlmat dhbtih) as Ibn 'Arab! calls it; 44 or Moses's "thick darkness where God was," perceived by Gregory of Nyssa as God's "bright darkness": "The Logos is dark" because "it sur- passes ordinary knowledge and is separated from mortal comprehen- sion by the tenebrae." 45 For the Romantics the Night is absorbed, so to speak, inside the self. It has become the Night of the creative mind. The "Mind of Man," says Wordsworth in the Prospectus, is more awesome than "the darkest pit of lowest Erebus." 46 It is an infinitely deep Night; or, to borrow a phrase from Joseph Conrad, an "absolute night." 47 Romanticism places the Absolute, as a creative source of poetic inspiration within the human mind. The venture of the poet into this Absolute, as is discussed in the next section, is reflected in the romantic concept of poetic language as a passionate longing for Silence. 43 Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore and London, 1971), p. 206. 44 TanazZul al-amldk. . au latd'if al-asrar, ed.

The poet is invoking silence in the act of writing itself. The romantic language of poetry is, in this sense, an incarna- tion of the silence of psychic depth in language. How did this come to be? The answer is tied up with the essential meaning of the ro- mantic concept of suggestive and symbolic language. Ahmad Zaki Abui Shadi (1892-1955), the Egyptian poet and romantic theoretician, insists in his writings on the identity of poetry and the "symbolic expression" of experience (al-ta'bir al-ramtz), which he opposes to "the poetry of statement" (al-nazm al-khabari). The poetry of statement, he argues, is "informative" (khabari), "like newspaper articles," 49 that is, it does not suggest the experience; it 'tells' about it. The formative source of Abui Shadi's concept of suggestion as the perfect poetic mode is A. C. Bradley's Oxford Inaugural lecture Poetry for Poetry's Sake (1901), which he bought at a Cairo bookshop and read in 1909. "It changed my earlier concept of poetry," he said.50 He made a translation of it which appeared in the second part of his first book Qatrah min yard'... (1910).51 That was, in fact, the first English critical essay to be translated into Arabic. In his Inaugural, Bradley insists on "the identity of form and content" in "a significant form," which is "purely poetic"; "and the degree of purity attained may be tested by the degree in which we feel it hopeless to convey the effect of a poem or passage in any form but its own." 52 Bradley's views, adapted by Abui Shadi, strike at the roots of the neo-classic concept of poetic language as a dress (rida') of thought, implying a distinction between conception and execution, which borders on the "decorative." In such a concept, says Bradley: We seem to perceive that the poet had a truth or fact-philosophical, agricultural, social-distinctly before him, and then, as we say, clothed in metrical and coloured language. Most argumentative, didactic, or satiric poems are partly of this kind; and in imaginative poems any- thing which is really a mere 'conceit' is mere decoration. 'Pure poetry' is the opposite of this. Pure poetry is not the decoration of a precon- ceived and clearly defined matter: it springs from the creative impulse of a vague imaginative mass pressing for development.53 49 Apollo, Vol. 1, no. 8, April 1933, p. 847. bO Interview in Nazardt naqdjyyah fi sbicr Abi Sbadi, ed.

A poem shines with its own unique essence; it has, to use Bradley's phrase, "a magical effect," which is the source of its sug- gestiveness. "This unique expression, which cannot be replaced by any other, still seems to be trying to express something beyond itself"-beyond form and content. In other words, the poem has an autonomy similar to that of a centre, with the potentiality of a centre for expanding into a circumference resonant at the threshold of the imageless absence of absolute Silence. What the poet says "seems to beckon away beyond itself, or rather to expand into something boundless which is only focused in it;" "into an all- embracing perfection (which cannot be expressed) in poetic words or words of any kind, nor yet in music or in any colour, but the suggestion of it is in much poetry, if not all, and poetry has in this suggestion, this 'meaning' a great part of its value." 54 The poetry which explores the possibility of silence should be symbolic. The rich resonance of a symbol is its suggestive expansion; and, as such, it is the opposite of the statement and of the rhetorical use of language, because a symbol is an equivalent verbal reality and not a comment on, or a reproduction of, a reality. Language in this sense is not a dress of knowledge; it builds the very structure of knowledge in a significant symbolic form. A symbol is an incarnation of silence in the body of language. In Sartor Resartus, a book which was translated into Arabic in 1926,~5 Carlyle, in the chapter on "Symbols", distilled the concept of the intimate relationship between Silence, Symbol and Night in the romantic theories of the language of poetry. "Bees will not work except in darkness; Thought will not work except in Silence..." it works through the "agency of symbols." 56 "In a Symbol there is concealment and yet revelation: here therefore, by Silence and by Speech acting together, comes a double significance."57 This takes us back to Coleridge's famous definition of the symbol in terms of its unifying power. A symbol, he says, is characterized by a translucence of the special in the individual, or of the general in the special, or of the universal and the general; above 54 Ibid., pp. 24-25. 66 Al-Kha'ifyarffi, tr.

It always partakes of the reality which it renders intelligible; and while it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part of that unity of which it is the representative.58 Subject, object and Being, transcendence and depth, meet in the romantic symbol. The symbol is organically identified with what it signifies. For Abui Shad!, romantic symbolism is synonymous with what he calls "mystical expressions" (al-ta'dbir al-.fsiyyah), a vague phrase which he probably uses as a gloss for "suggestion" in its Bradleian aesthetic and metaphysical sense.59 The equation 'suggestive' with 'indefinitiveness' and with 'mystic' also occurs in Edgar Allan Poe: "... a suggestive indefinitiveness of meaning, with the view of bringing about a definitiveness of vague and therefore, of spiritual effect... Give to it any undue decision... [and you] dissolve the atmosphere of the mystic upon which it floats." The suggestive symbol is necessarily obscure because it pertains in mystery. Al- Hamshari published an enthusiastic defence of "the beauty of sym- bolic obscurity" (jamdl al ibbdm al-ram#i), which is for him synon- ymous with poetic creation. Symbols, he says, "take the imaginative mind on fluttering wings to some valley of genii or shadows... to some magical city of the imagination, a city of twilight or dawn, or to a temple [where one sees] the sacred flame of the gods; [and the temple] is obscured by mists and lit by prophets' torches".60 Al-Hamshari is, it seems, aware of the dimension of depth involved here. A symbol, he continues, is not definable because it exists at "the boundaries of overwhelming knowledge," mystery and silence. It is obscure because it comes from "the hidden stratum (al-majdl al-kdmin)" of the mind and passes through the subconscious "before it ripens in the powerful, limitless [poetic] conscious mind." 6' The romantic silence-symbol is inextricably involved with psychic depth. V Such is the poetic view. The religious symbol, on the other hand, is intersubjective. It expresses the mysterium of the bond between 58 The Stateman's Manual, in The Complete Wlorks, ed. W. G. W.

The situation is one of openness: the openness of human experience to ultimate reality and of God-as- Being to the world. Logos is dark and silent. But it is also open to human language, which in turn must also 'open up' to be capable of being illuminated by the presence of the Word of God in it. The opening up of the word to the Word presupposes: (i) that though the Word transcends the word, there is an in- timate bond between the two; (ii) that language is no longer, as in Romanticism, an expression of a circumscribed ego, of psychic depth; and (iii) that this 'bond' is mysterious, ontological, intersubjective and as such, is beyond a cause-and-effect pattern and cannot be explained epistemologically. The religious mystical symbol is the incarnation of the 'Ontological Mystery' of this bond between numinous Silence, the centre of which is everywhere but the circumference nowhere, and the response of human language in its imaginative openness. In this sense, it participates in the reality of Being-itself; but pre- eminently it is, more than a mediating agent, an expression of a basic unity between the Divine and the human. M.
