This numerical breadth in itself suggests two things. First, it is not pos- sible for any scholars to be sure that their coverage of the secondary material is complete. To remain current on all that is published about Maimonides is a full- time job, one that leaves little opportunity to actually write about him. Second, it is not conceivable for any Rambam scholars to think that what they publish is the "final word" on what Maimonides intended to say on any topic. If you want to take a critical stance you could say that what he wrote is too fuzzy for that, but I would say, more constructively, that Maimonides' writings are too rich in depth and com- plexity for us to ever exhaust what he wrote. That richness in itself is one of the reasons for studying and teaching Maimonides. It is a good indication why Mai- monides' theology properly ranks among the greatest bodies of work in the histo- ry of philosophy. How then is it possible to assess the status of Maimonides studies at the end of the twentieth century? There is no straightforward way to do it, at least not with any kind of conceptual depth. What I have chosen to do instead is to examine three 1. Amazon.com lists 120 books with the name "Maimonides" in the title. (Yahoo.com lists 95. The Arizona State University Library, whose collection in Judaica, especially in Jewish philosophy, is in no way distinguished, possesses 107 books with the name "Maimonides" in the title.) That means that there a minimum of 120 books currently in print in the United States that deal with what Mai- monides had to say. Similarly, the Philosopher's Index, whose subject matter is limited to scholarly es- says in philosophy, dating back no further than 1940, lists 220 entries. The total list of written works on Maimonides, of course, is much larger. These 120 books and 220 articles are almost exclusively works written in English published in the final half of the twentieth century. 93</page><page sequence="2">Norbert M. Samuelson recent book-length studies of Maimonides' philosophy, all published in the clos- ing years of the century, all first-rate (i.e., rigorous, careful, and creative), and all entirely different-not only in what they claim Maimonides said but also in the historical, intellectual, and academic contexts within which they frame Mai- monides' thought. All three books are "must-reading" for serious scholars of Mai- monides the philosophical theologian. KREISEL: ISRAELI SCHOLARSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY Howard Kreisel is an Associate Professor at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, where he teaches Jewish thought together with his colleagues Daniel Lasker and Gerald Blidstein. His doctoral work was completed at Brandeis Uni- versity under the direction of Alexander Altmann, Marvin Fox, and Alfred Ivry. Kreisel's work reflects the influence of all his teachers and colleagues. The book is a collection of previously published essays with an introductory chapter that attempts to unify the work.2 One of the many attractive features of Kreisel's organization is that the book contains a detailed synopsis of each essay with useful summaries of each distinct section within each chapter. In fact, the syn- opsis is so good that there is no reason here to repeat a summary in my own words. Instead I will briefly state the main theme in each essay and then turn to some crit- ical comments. According to the first chapter, the central theme that emerges from the re- maining six essay-chapters is twofold. First, Maimonides' philosophy emerges from his primary commitment to Judaism, not to philosophy. Second, the heart of Mai- monides' philosophical defense of Judaism is his opposition to idolatry. What counts here as "philosophy" is primarily Alfarabi's writings on political philosophy. The defense of the first thesis is in opposition to Strauss's interpretation of Maimonides' use of esotericism to veil a primary commitment to Aristotelian philosophy. Chapter Two is an analysis of the relationship between the practical and the theoretical intellect. Kreisel argues that Maimonides' failure to distinguish them is a teaching device. Maimonides judges the Torah to be a work in practical intellect, which is an exercise in the use of imagination. As for why Mosaic prophecy is di- vorced from the use of imaginative excellence, Kreisel argues that Maimonides makes this non-normative move to prevent the laws of the Torah from being read allegorically, and that this motive is to be understood in the general context of read- ing Rambam's primary intention as a defense of Judaism from idolatry. Chapter Three is an argument for the moral primacy of theoretical wisdom in Maimonides' ethics, tracing the sources of Maimonides' judgments here to the Aristotelian commentaries and philosophy of Alfarabi and Avicenna. In the course of his argument, Kreisel introduces three different senses of the term "good." This ambiguity is the focus in Chapter Four, which deals explicitly with Maimonides' conception of what it means to imitate God. Kreisel argues that claimed contra- dictions between Maimonides' treatment of this concept in the Guide of the Per- plexed and in his more legal writings (notably in Sefer Mitzvot and the Mishneh 2. Chapter 2 was first published in HUCA in 1988, Chapter 3 in lyyun in 1989, Chapter 4 in AJS Review in 1994, Chapter 5 in PAAJR in 1992. 94</page><page sequence="3">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century Torah) are resolved by reading these works with care and by remembering that the Guide is not a philosophic system; therefore, Maimonides need not explain every- thing that he means. Chapter Five deals explicitly with the general issue of contradictions in Mai- monides' ethics. Again the claim is that careful readings will show that what seems to be contradictory is really not so. The apparent tensions dissolve when we con- sider Maimonides' different perspectives-(1) that of the solitary, elite individual, for whom perfection is independent and achievable and ethics is an end in itself that is known through the rational faculty, and (2) that of the society as a whole, for whom ethics is a means to an end that cannot be achieved and rests on accept- ed conventions in a social context. Kreisel has made a significant contribution to the study of Maimonides. It comes out of one of the major lines of academic studies in the intellectual history of Jewish philosophical texts, a line that goes back to Wolfson through Altmann, Strauss and Twersky in the United States, through the students of Pines at the end of the century. Kreisel is American-trained, but this book shows how much he has become part of Israeli scholarship in medieval Jewish philosophy. For this group, the single most important influence in setting the agenda for Maimonidean schol- arship has been Strauss. Strauss was not the first commentator to suggest that Mai- monides hid his true intent, but Strauss's way of interpreting what Maimonides meant when he said that his work is esoteric has been the single dominant theme that runs throughout Israeli historical studies of Maimonides' writings. Kreisel stands clearly within this dominant tradition of late-twentieth-century scholarship and this book is a fine example of the academic tradition's health. Still, there is one criticism to which I would like to call the readers' attention. With reference to Kreisel's first chapter, I agree that there are no valid grounds for doubting Maimonides' strong commitment to what we would today call a religious, even spiritual, understanding of Judaism. However, it is less cer- tain that, as Kreisel argues, Maimonides does not have an equivalently strong com- mitment to the value of philosophy. Kreisel says that Maimonides "does not de- fine himself as belonging to the philosophic camp," but rather "as belonging to a particular religious tradition" (p. 1). But this is the wrong way to put the issue. Phi- losophy and a religious tradition are not "camps." It is for Rambam an apples- and-oranges comparison. In support of his claim, Kreisel points out that when "Maimonides speaks in terms of 'we,' he is addressing his coreligionists. The philosophers are invariably referred to as 'they"' (p. 1). But this is a non sequitur, as Kreisel himself admits when he adds that the "commitment to philosophy and the commitment to Judaism, or to any religious tradition, are not necessarily mu- tually exclusive" (p. 2). The "we/they" distinction says nothing about camps; rather the "we" indicates whom Rambam conceives as his audience, that is, a cer- tain class of Jews, and the "they" refers to his non-Jewish (Greek as well as Ara- bic) philosophical sources. Kreisel's conclusion is correct, specifically, that "Maimonides' primary com- mitment was not to a further exploration of the frontiers of knowledge illumi- nated by Aristotle. He did not take upon himself the task to expand the borders of philosophy. Maimonides' principal effort was directed to the understanding and 95</page><page sequence="4">Norbert M. Samuelson strengthening of Judaism" (p. 2). The point is accurate, but misleading. For, de- spite his claim to the opposite, Kreisel thinks of philosophy and religion as op- posing camps and not as complementary. Maimonides is not concerned with ex- tending the limits of philosophy because (as Maimonides argues specifically with reference to the origin and end of the world) philosophy already is at its limits. Phi- losophy (viz., natural science) can understand what is within the world, both tem- porally and spatially, but it cannot understand either (spatially) the world in gen- eral (hence the weakness of astronomy and the impossibility of cosmology) or the world's origin and end (hence the impossibility of both cosmogony and eschatol- ogy). To understand these domains we are dependent on revelation and a reliable tradition for understanding the revelation. Here the commitment is not really to Ju- daism as such. Maimonides does not use the term. Rather, he speaks of "the law of Moses." If his interest were in "religion," then there would indeed be camps. But it is not. Rather, his interest is in ways to grasp truth, one of which is the revealed Torah as interpreted through a claimed unbroken chain of rabbinic tradition. Hence, it is not the Jewish party to whom Maimonides is here committed (even though he undoubtedly was), but to the Jewish texts. Furthermore, he is not com- mitted to them simply because he is a Jew. That is too modern a view to project back on Rambam. Rather, he is committed to them because he believes that through them we can achieve true belief beyond the knowledge presented through the natural sciences. This critique is, in effect, a summary of what we will see be- low as a major theme of Faur. FAUR: EUROPEAN SCHOLARSHIP AND MYSTICISM Faur argues that the kind of"Wissenschaft" approach to studying the Guide that we encountered in Kreisel is inherently inadequate. Instead it must be read through what Faur labels (following Eliade) "creative hermeneutics." Faur's use of his understanding of this technique makes the Guide primarily a study in theolog- ical Kabbalah-"theological" in the sense that it is what Maimonides says about God that becomes the central theme of the work, and "Kabbalah" because Faur's Maimonides can claim a certain grasping of the divine that reflects more Jewish mysticism than Jewish philosophy. In this sense, then, Faur's Guide is also about religious experience. Hebrew mysticism, Faur tells us, posits mystical experience as an end at which the perfected human arrives, at which stage the human transcends being hu- man. For Hebrew mysticism religious experience is the end or goal of human ex- istence, not a beginning of a path that leads to perfection. This kind of mysticism has two forms. There is the mysticism of Maimonides that is theocentric and dean- thropomorphic, which stands in marked contrast to the mysticism of Kabbalism that is ethnographic and anthropocentric. However, the two forms share the claims that there is a radical ontological difference between the human and the divine, that this difference entails that God must be revealed rather than discovered, and that prayer and prophecy are the same thing. Faur distinguishes three stages of knowledge: (1) a rejection of imagination in favor of rationality, (2) the consequent discovery of objective, non-sensate, reali- ty, and finally (3) transcendence of the objective for union with the divine. He goes 96</page><page sequence="5">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century on to argue that the animality of the human transcends the three stages of knowl- edge, and that Maimonides' understanding of perfection is as a unity of the indi- vidual and society that transcends the vision of human perfection in the parable of the cave in Plato's Republic. In at least this sense Faur and Kreisel agree that in Maimonides' vision of human perfection the distinction dissolves between the good of the individual in the autonomous pursuit of intellectual knowledge and the good of the whole in the creation through practical wisdom of a just society. Faur, no less than Kreisel, has made a significant contribution to the study of Maimonides. However, the two books are radically different kinds of academic work. Whereas the primary influence sources for Kreisel are academic studies of Jewish philosophical texts as intellectual history, for Faur, Maimonides' works are part of a living tradition of constructive Jewish theology that has its roots in Span- ish literature and contemporary academic studies of religious experience no less than in Kabbalah. Among the voices behind the analyses of both Kreisel and Faur is Leo Strauss, but most of the other voices are significantly different. Whereas Kreisel will quote Altmann and Pines, for example, Faur quotes Mircea Eliade and Jorge Luis Borges. Whereas Kreisel compares Maimonides' thought with the po- litical ethics of Aristotle, Faur compares Rambam with the psychology of Sigmund Freud. Kreisel's Maimonides is primarily situated in time. What Kreisel says is re- lated to contemporary ethics, but in no sense are his pronouncements taken seri- ously to be relevant to contemporary ethics. Faur's Maimonides, on the other hand, is a living religious mystic. His Maimonides is timeless; his voice is as alive today as it was in the twelfth century. Hence, there is a kind of intellectual excitement in reading Faur's text that cannot be said for reading Kreisel's. With Kreisel's work, the primary sets of questions have to do with whether or not the claims made are historically accurate; with Faur's work we can also ask whether what Maimonides says is true. Much of Faur's study should be assented to, but not all of it. I will here raise three lines of criticism. One deals with Faur's use of the term "myth," a sec- ond with his treatment of time, and the third with Maimonides' conception of cre- ation. Concerning myth, Faur makes the following judgments that seem problem- atic. Faur tells us that "perplexity" arises at the juncture where "neither rationali- ty nor prophecy are operative" (p. 111). At this point ordinary language "cannot articulate the fantastic, hence, the need for metaphor" (p. 111). This description closely fits what Plato in the Timaeus called "myth," but Faur does not seem to rec- ognize this connection. In fact Plato's account of cosmogony is very close to Faur's, but, again, Faur seems unfamiliar with this critical part of the Timaeus. Otherwise he could not say that "the Platonic thesis implies that divine and human knowledge are homogeneous" (p. 124). That clearly is wrong. Plato's creation story is a tale about space which lies beyond the two primary categories of Plato's epistemolo- gy, namely reason (whose domain consists of ideas) and opinion (whose domain consists of sense experience). Space is real, but it is neither an idea nor something that can be experienced. Hence, Plato introduces the notion of "myth" as a way to handle it. Cosmology, Faur tells us, "results in a crisis of reason that could be re- solved either by regressing to mythology or by entering the world of esoterics and prophecy" (p. 124), but this clearly is not how myth functions for Plato. It is any- 97</page><page sequence="6">Norbert M. Samuelson thing but a regression. In fact it has more in common to the epistemic characteris- tics of what Faur calls "esoterics." Concerning time I will limit myself to a single text. With reference to Sinai being in natural rather than mythical time, Faur says that the "Jewish Sabbath does not mark a primordial cosmological moment but the beginning of historical time" (p. 144). That judgment is far from self-evident. It is intended as a criticism of Eliade, but, again, it is not so obvious that Eliade's analysis in this case does not fit Maimonides, or other Jewish philosophers for that matter, notably Gersonides and Rosenzweig. There are all kinds of time. Rosenzweig at least, commenting on the biblical view of creation as well as Maimonides' negative theology, distin- guishes between mythical and historical time. Historical time is that of pagans; for Jews and Christians there are two other kinds of notions of time, both of which are "mythical." By comparison Faur's analysis is much too simplistic. Finally, concerning Faur's treatment of creation by Maimonides, I would raise the following considerations. Faur argues that to "deny Creation ex nihilo it would be necessary to postulate an ontological link between the deity and man, and either deny perfect omniscience and omnipresence from the deity or human freedom of choice" (p. 94). However, this is a non sequitur. Choice and freedom of choice are not the same thing. Freedom is something the medieval Jewish philosophers tended to ascribe only to God. Humans have choice, but it need not be free. And they could make this distinction while at the same time, consistently and coherently, affirming a belief in creation ex nihilo. Faur correctly states that creation is something "willful," which entails that it is not due to "necessity." But he adds that this kind of creation "is akin to the principle of probability" (p. 114), and this extension is far from clear. Probability goes with chance, which Maimonides and Faur identify with the view of the Epi- cureans. Faur also says that this probability that is associated with divine creation "cannot be 'determined.'... Therefore, although God knows the future, it remains indeterminate" (p. 114). Now this claim has a long history of philosophical dis- cussion, including in Jewish philosophy, and it remains unsettled to this day. It is not at all obvious that because God's act of creation is indeterminate, the world is indeterminate. Hence, it is conceptually possible for God to create a world inde- terminately that is itself knowable determinately. The problem is that Faur fails to see what we have already brought out in his discussion of myth, that is, that Platonic cosmogony, at least in the Timeaus, can- not be reduced to Aristotelian cosmology. Hence, Faur can state that the "eternity of the universe posits a Platonic kind of knowledge, essentially contemplative- not a function of creation" (p. 121), which simply is not true, and Maimonides ex- plicitly says that it is not true when he comments that the Timaeus could be used to interpret the biblical account of creation. Whether or not that is what Mai- monides in fact does is an issue discussed in our final work for consideration. SEESKIN: AMERICAN SCHOLARSHIP AND PHILOSOPHY Seeskin, a professor of philosophy and former chair of the philosophy de- partment at Northwestern University and, from its beginning, a major figure in the 98</page><page sequence="7">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century international Academy for Jewish Philosophy, has written a first-rate work in Jew- ish philosophy-a fine example of how intellectual history is enriched by a philo- sophical perspective and constructive theology is deepened by historical knowl- edge. This work does so by presenting an extended discussion of the concept of monotheism in relationship to Maimonides' negative theology. The book consists of seven chapters with an appendix on Maimonides' esotericism. The first chapter argues that Maimonides presents us with a Judaism that is inherently philosophic. More accurately, Seeskin uses Maimonides as a focus to construct his own argument for the centrality of philosophy and rational theology to Judaism. To present God in a human form is both anthropomorphic and in- escapable, but to say that it is inescapable does not allow us freely to think of God in this way. We are obliged to present a philosophical account for this move. Sees- kin's thought here is directed against contemporary feminist Jewish theology. In effect he claims against these Jewish thinkers that by avoiding philosophy in their theology they affirm a deity for Judaism who simply is anthropomorphic, without qualification, and, as such, is idolatrous. Jewish feminist theologians, however, are not Seeskin's main opponents in this chapter. That status is reserved for Leo Strauss and his radical separation of philosophy (Athens) from religion and Judaism (Jerusalem). Against Strauss's claim that the two are incompatible, Seeskin argues that it is a mistake to see phi- losophy as a set of fixed truths. Rather, as is clearly exhibited in Aristotle's Topics, philosophy should be understood as dialectical reasoning, where the way of think- ing rather than the conclusions of the thought is what defines the discipline. The question is, can Judaism be understood in the same way, that is, as something whose thought is dialectical. Seeskin's argument for Judaism being dialectical is that the Judaism of Maimonides was dialectical. Seeskin's second chapter argues that it is more important to avoid idolatry than it is to gain intelligibility. In his third chapter, Seeskin faces the problem of prayer in a Maimonidean form of radical monotheism. Here the challenge comes from Thomas Aquinas' argumentation against an interpretation of divine attributes as absolutely equivocal because this extreme interpretation of equivocality cannot preserve the ordinary usage in prayer of affirmative statements about God. The bottom line of Seeskin's defense of his interpretation of Maimonides' monotheism is that all language is a form of idolatry but prayer is a concession that allows us to say something. Chapter Four is Seeskin's interpretation of what Maimonides believed about creation. Seeskin properly associates this doctrine with the previous discussion of prayer. Prayer seems to be a relationship between the creator and those whom he created. If there is no real relationship, then it would seem to follow that there can be no prayer, and a religion without prayer would indeed not be Judaism. Chapter Five deals with the doctrine of imitatio Dei. Seeskin argues, against both Hermann Cohen and Steven Schwarzschild, that this highest ethical ideal, while difficult, is nonetheless achievable, and, in agreement with Faur, as the ide- al is approached the distinction between practical and theoretical wisdom disap- pears. For Maimonides the way it is achieved is through observance of the 613 99</page><page sequence="8">Norbert M. Samuelson commandments. This ideal can also be called devequt, but even the Kabbalists, contrary to Idel's interpretation, did not consider a mystical union with God to mean actually becoming one with God. Still, the problem is, how can something finite like a human being imitate what is infinite? Seeskin argues that Maimonides used a Platonist conception of the world and of knowledge to present imitatio Dei as a process of purification from worldly matter in order to enable ultimate conjunction not with God proper but with the Agent Intellect. Next, Seeskin turns to the central topic of Kreisel's book, what kind of wis- dom constitutes the attainment of human perfection. He notes that Shlomo Pines and Larry Berman argue that it is political, Schwarzschild and Hermann Cohen that it is ethical, and Julius Guttmann that the ethical takes on a new dimension af- ter intellectual perfection is achieved. Seeskin argues that the line between the the- oretical and the practical fades as the ideal is approximated. Having settled to his own satisfaction the historical question of what Mai- monides believed, Seeskin turns to the philosophical question: whether that belief is believable. The seventeenth-century rejection of the medieval physics of form and matter and the medieval epistemology in which there is a conjunction between knower and known leads to the Kantian move of explaining divine transcendence in terms of ethics rather than physics. However, the ideal remains no less remote from the actual in modern philosophy than the heavens were remote from the earth in medieval philosophy. Kant and Hermann Cohen, no less than Maimonides, see holiness as a process of becoming like God, and this process involves continuous purification from the concerns of the self and the world. The problem is that hu- mans will by nature fail to make this separation, and there is no "ought" without a "can." The solution for both is to assume an infinite amount of time to succeed through subsequent lives. However, this solution is not available to a Maimonides, for whom there is no development of the soul after death. Seeskin raises a number of objections to the Kantian view and argues that the medieval view is preferable. The reason for the preference is Seeskin's opposition to seeing the end as asymp- totic. Chapter Six argues that Maimonides' thirteen "pillars of faith" lie beyond what even the pious can know. Contrary to Moses Mendlessohn, Judaism is an or- thodoxy and not just an orthopraxy. The problem is, however, how Judaism can command belief in God. Bahya argues in Duties of the Heart that belief is volun- tary. Maimonides' position is more subtle. Belief involves representation and af- firmation, which corresponds to meaning and truth, which involve apprehension in the former case and judgment in the latter. It is judgment that requires volition even when the judgment is necessary. The final chapter summarizes Seeskin's conclusions and deals directly with the charge that Maimonides' form of Judaism, at least in the radical way Seeskin presents it, is a religion that few, if any, Jews would adopt. Seeskin argues in re- sponse that Rambam's Judaism and popular religion are reconcilable. This argu- ment turns on showing what sense can be made out of saying that Rambam's de- ity is a person, and what it means to love him. 100</page><page sequence="9">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century What popular religion calls the love of God cannot really be love, because, according to Seeskin's Maimonides, it is not possible to really love an illusion. Maimonides' God does love as a person, and not (contrary to Hermann Cohen) as an ideal. Rather, it is God's personal love that makes it possible for us to love him. The real question about the love of God does not have to do with whether or not God is a person. All of these theologians make that assertion. The issue is whether the person we love is an ideal person, as Cohen claims, or a concrete person, as Rosenzweig and Buber claim. However, both approaches are guilty of anthropo- morphism because both entail a correlation between the divine and the human. For Maimonides, God is radically other and asymmetric with the human. Rosenzweig sees the commandment to love God as the starting point of the human journey to- wards perfection, but for Maimonides it is the final end. Of the three books I found Seeskin's to be the most exciting, probably be- cause, like Seeskin's, my interests in the writings of people like Maimonides are philosophical. I find this to be Seeskin's most philosophically and religiously ma- ture statement. He is a major figure in contemporary Jewish philosophical theol- ogy and this is his most important work, both as intellectual history and as con- structive theology. Still, I do have a number of criticisms to raise, most but not all of which are minor. Seeskin says that the Guide is "a letter written to a disciple named Joseph, an observant Jew unsure whether to follow his intellect and renounce the Law or hold fast to the Law and renounce the intellect" (p. 11). I don't think that is quite right. There is no either/or presented for Joseph. Rather, he is perplexed as to how the two are correlated. Seeskin argues that philosophy is a corrective of the tendency of imagina- tion to employ anthropomorphism, and revelation is a corrective on the tendency of reason to subject God to principles of reason (p. 14). Again, I think this an in- appropriate either/or. Modelling in science is a good example of how reason em- ploys imagination. Fractals are an even better example. Seeskin tells us that according to his "vision" the experience of God is nev- er direct. "Even at the highest levels, it is plagued by doubt and uncertainty." Fur- thermore, we "cannot resolve this issue simply by citing Scripture because doing so will only raise the question of how Scripture should be interpreted" (p. 22). If this is so, why should he or Maimonides or any one else pay any attention to Scrip- ture at all, since the implication is that Scripture has absolutely no epistemic au- thority. It is an important question, critical I think to Seeskin's defense of a ratio- nal Judaism. It is in short the question of revelation. Seeskin never deals with it, and that is a major omission. Seeskin argues that the reason why Maimonides opts for a metaphysical in- terpretation of imitatio Dei is that Maimonides accepts enough of the Platonic world view to regard earthly matter as the source of evil and sees imitatio Dei as a way to free ourselves from matter (p. 96). Now, if Maimonides sees the created world in Platonic terms, why does he not see creation that way as well? In short, I do not find Seeskin's arguments for adopting creatio ex nihilo and de novo as if it were opposed to a Platonic cosmogony convincing. Certainly for Rambam creation 101</page><page sequence="10">Norbert M. Samuelson is out of nothing and totally unique. But what does Maimonides think that means? I have suggested that he thinks that means something like what Plato gives us in a different story form in the Timeaus. In relation to the end of his book, Seeskin's argument for why Rambam's view of the love commandment differs radically from those of modem Jewish philosophers like Buber, Rosenzweig, and Levinas is unconvincing. Seeskin ar- gues that any concept of God is inadequate simply because it is a conception and, as such, compromises divine uniqueness. That's right, but that's because God is a person and not a concept. Seeskin then says that talk about God should be under- stood as "ways in which the idea of divinity is presented to us, not ways in which it is circumscribed by our attempts at classification" (p. 161). But whom is Sees- kin attacking here? Certainly not Buber, Rosenzweig, and Levinas. Furthermore, Seeskin asserts that on Rambam's view there is "a radical asymmetry because of God's uniqueness" (p. 159). However, God is just as radically other for Levinas, Rosenzweig, and Buber as he is for Seeskin. The issue is that what Seeskin's Mai- monides and the modem Jewish philosophers in question say about the radical oth- erness of God, the modem Jewish philosophers say about the radical otherness of the human, and that is why symmetry is possible. This assertion makes sense of the love of God as the love of neighbor in a way that Seeskin's account of Mai- monides can not approximate. Finally, I want to say something about Seeskin's critique of understanding ethics as the pursuit of asymptotes. Seeskin thinks that all unattainable ends are in- significant, which is why he thinks that asymptotic interpretations of the human ideal are not sound. His objection seems to be pragmatic. He tells us that if "the goal is not attainable, if it outstrips even the most generous estimate of human ca- pacity, then so far from providing hope for a better world, religion would only pro- vide despair or what Hegel termed alienation" (p. 92). But what has become of Seeskin's hard-headed commitment to monotheism? He says that even while it might help people pray to think of God imaginatively, they must not, because of the danger of idolatry. Better that people not know to whom they are praying than pray to the wrong God. Doesn't that apply as well to people's moral actions as it does to their worship? Isn't it also better that people not know why they are pur- suing an end than to pursue the wrong end, especially since that end, namely, ulti- mate human wisdom, is in some sense associated with divinity? Seeskin's primary opposition to an asymptotic reading of the ideal is his commitment to defending Rambam's understanding of divine difference as ab- solute equivocation. As such he feels he must remove the attainment of human per- fection from any association whatsoever with the divine as divine. The alternative is to make Gersonides' (to my view vastly more intelligent) judgment that the re- lation between divine and human attributes is pros hen3 equivocal. Ralbag's judg- 3. I.e., equivocal in such a way that the term has a primary, paradigmatic meaning, and all oth- er significantly different uses of the term have a meaning that is derived in one way or another from the paradigm. On Gersonides' use of this term, see Norbert M. Samuelson, Gersonides on God 's Knowl- edge (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1977), p. 28. 102</page><page sequence="11">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century ment leads directly to the asymptotic model of Cohen, Rosenzweig, and Schwarz- schild. In support of his position Seeskin quotes Ehud Benor's statement that the modem view is "romantic."4 It certainly is. But it is eminently reasonable as well, far more reasonable than Seeskin's uncompromising rationalist Maimonides with his (in my judgment) excessively radicalized monotheism. CONCLUSIONS What can we conclude about the state of academic Maimonidean studies at the end of the twentieth century? Different scholars will answer the question in different ways. There are at least three loci for Maimonidean scholarship-Israel, Europe, and the United States. There are differences of approaches and cannons in these three centers. But the differences have more to do with the intellectual orientations of the scholars and less with their geographic locations. Kreisel is American-born and educated, but his agenda does reflect the predominant interest of Israeli scholars on intellectual history, especially focused on Maimonides' Islam- ic predecessors. Faur has taught in America and now teaches in Israel, but his in- terests, as his references exhibit, are clearly European. His Maimonides is a time- less mystic, and reading the Rambam this way is certainly a legitimate way to interpret him. Minimally it helps us visualize what Alexander Altmann might have meant when he spoke against a radical separation of Jewish philosophy and mys- ticism.5 The only clear case of identification of geographical and intellectual lo- cation is Kenneth Seeskin. His agenda in reading Maimonides is religious and root- ed in an English language tradition of doing philosophy. This has not been the dominant orientation of Maimonidean studies since Wolfson. Certainly it is im- possible to study Jewish philosophy abstracted from the historical context of the writing, but that study could be less historical and far more philosophical than it has been. However, that is my American intellectual bias, no less than Seeskin's. For me as a student, the direction-determining works of the first half of the century were Isaac Husik's Introduction to Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy, Harry A. Wolfson's Crescas' Critique ofAristotle, and Shlomo Pines' English translation of Maimonides' Guide with Leo Strauss' introduction. Husik's work not only in- troduced me and others (at least in North America) to the field, but the texts he dealt with constituted for all of us a sort of canon, works that determined the his- torical context into which the Guide was to be located. In the second half of the century that canon has been significantly expanded. It now includes works on Jew- ish mysticism as well as philosophy and it extends beyond the late middle ages into the early modern period. Wolfson's work set the standard for what it means to do a thorough and rich analysis of a sophisticated philosophical text in the context of the history of ideas. 4.

It should be noted that David Blumenthal also has argued that Maimonides should be un- derstood historically within a certain tradition of Islamic rationalist mysticism. 103</page><page sequence="12">Norbert M. Samuelson It still is, in my judgment, unequaled in quality and, therefore, continues to set the standard of excellence for the field. Wolfson's commentaries extended the topics of interest in the Guide beyond religious concerns to the philosophy of science, and located the book beyond Jewish philosophy in the domain of Muslim and Christian theology. As is evident in the three books discussed in this essay, the range of topics of interest is now considerably broader. I think it can be safely said that no one can any longer read the Guide as a work of religious philosophy in iso- lation from Maimonides' other writings, especially his halakhic ones. Further- more, the Guide can no longer be read simply as a work of rationalist theology. As the books of both Kreisel and Faur show, approaches to the work from the per- spectives of Jewish mysticism and political ethics are no less central to the text than are questions of physics and metaphysics. Pines' translation of the Guide became the standard for writing translations, that is, translations that attempt to make text no more intelligible than it actually is, reserving commentary to footnotes. An accurate translation, one that is pre- cisely imprecise, is of course an unattainable ideal, but it nonetheless is and should be the translator's goal. Finally, Strauss' introduction to the Guide determined the most widely dis- cussed question in Maimonidean studies for the second half of the century-how are we to interpret Maimonides' professed esotericism. It is clear from the three books considered that this question has had some light shed on it, but it is not settled. I doubt that it ever will be. What is clear, at least in the three books dis- cussed here, is that whatever were Maimonides' motives, they were not what Strauss thought they were. Maimonides did not believe that Aristotelian natural philosophy and rabbinic Judaism were irreconcilable. He was not a philosophi- cal marrano. As this conclusion about Strauss' reading is the most controversial claim I have to make in this essay, it requires some explanation. With reference to the works considered here, my main argument is with Kreisel. He suggests that Ram- bam is hiding the fact that the only ones who can attain "final perfection" and, as disembodied intellects, overcome the death and degeneration of the body, are those members of an elite who achieve intellectual perfection (p. 7). Kreisel says, para- phrasing Rambam, that there is no 'injustice' in this state of affairs. This is simply the way of the world. Of course the philosopher does not go and teach these matters publicly to the masses. Discretion is not only the better part of valor, but also the philosoph- ically more responsible course. The masses are taught those beliefs or myths that ensure their proper behavior and contribute to the welfare of society" (p. 7). But Rambam does not make a secret of these judgments, and even if he did, it was completely transparent. Certainly if there really are secrets, they must be more than just this. However, Kreisel seems thoroughly committed to Strauss' conspiracy the- sis when he says that Maimonides "is interested in concealing his views from many 104</page><page sequence="13">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century of his readers, at the same time he imparts them to some." Yet the general theme that runs throughout Kreisel's work is that the historically claimed contradictions are only apparent and not real once we see that Maimonides' claims are set with- in different contextual perspectives. I don't think that Kreisel has freed himself as much as he has claimed to, at least not yet, from the influence of Straussian con- spiracy theories of intellectual history. Another hidden view that Kreisel claims for Maimonides is that the world was not created ex nihilo but that it is, as the Aristotelians claim, eternal. With ref- erence to the "Laws of the Principles of the Torah" 1:5 and the "Laws of Idolatry" 1:3 in the Mishneh Torah, Kreisel says that the "nonphilosophic reader will cer- tainly understand (the cited texts) as conveying the notion of creation as ex nihilo. The philosophic reader will grasp the true meaning of this phrase as it is used by Maimonides in this context" (p. 43). But this is not at all an obvious claim. In fact both Herbert Davidson and I, independently and by very different means, have ar- gued fairly extensively that a simple "out of nothing" interpretation of what Mai- monides believed is far from the best possible interpretation of his words. If Kreisel wants to maintain this interpretation, it requires a defense, and that defense must include dealing with alternative arguments. Kreisel says that "Maimonides focused on the single most important issue to which the other areas of disagreement can be traced-creation" (p. 219), but Kreisel offers no argument to support this claim. It is far from obvious. At least equal in importance is corporeal attributions to God. However, I am not claiming that no argument exists to support his claim. In fact, at least one has been given, by Gersonides in the introduction to The Wars of the Lord. The objection is that Kreisel doesn't give one. Similarly, Kreisel claims that not "even in the Guide does [Maimonides] in- dicate that the acceptance of creation contributes to the true conception of God necessary for the perfection of the intellect" (p. 220). That's because it doesn't. What is at stake in the creation vs. eternity dispute is whether the universe is con- tingent or necessary and, to the extent that it is contingent, it cannot be known. Cre- ation entails that intellect alone is insufficient, no matter how developed, to know everything. So much is clear in Gersonides. Kreisel does not seem to know this lit- erature, and in this case the lack is significant. Kreisel wants to argue that Mai- monides believed in a purely intellectual human perfection. Prima facie that pre- supposes that at least in principle all of the universe is intellectually knowable. However, the doctrine of creation (whether it be eternally or temporally created) entails that such complete knowledge is in principle unattainable given the very nature of the universe itself. If this analysis is correct, and I think it is, then Kreisel's central thesis about human perfection is in need of serious repair. It is in his fourth chapter that Kreisel argues that most of the inconsistencies in Rambam's writings are only apparent and those that are real are "due to the re- ligious sensitivity of the subject in question ... or for pedagogical reasons" (p. 125). By the former claim he means that Maimonides hides some matters be- cause of his concern for the welfare of Judaism, which was the dominant way of reading Maimonides prior to Strauss, from Gersonides through Isaac Husik. How- 105</page><page sequence="14">Norbert M. Samuelson ever, even these exceptions should not be granted given the strong, and to me con- vincing, arguments against an esoteric reading of Maimonides' corpus in Kreisel, pp. 126-27. Faur and Seeskin offer very different interpretations of Maimonides' eso- tericism. For Faur the whole work is esoteric. For him esotericism represents a way of thinking beyond rationalism that is the path to the attainment of human perfec- tion. For Seeskin, like Kreisel, the role of the esoteric is far more limited. What Maimonides hides is that the foundational beliefs of Judaism cannot be proven. Rather, they are what reasonable people will believe even though they know these views cannot be demonstrated. On Seeskin's reading of the texts Maimonides clearly wants to hide from the masses what they are not ready to hear, but how deep does the hiding go? Strauss says that it is deep. Maimonides' method is to assert A and B, which are contraries, and the one said least frequently is the one that Maimonides believes. All three books share in common a rejection of Strauss's approach to the text of the Guide. Where Strauss sees doctrinal contradictions, Seeskin in particular sees conjectures. When viewed this way, i.e., with what Seeskin calls "conceptual flexibility," most of the claimed contradictions disappear. Seeskin argues this specifically with ref- erence to Mosaic prophecy, creation, imitatio Dei, miracles, the use of Kalam ar- guments, divine volition, and (what for Seeskin is the most important example) the claim that the divine intellect is like the human intellect. Seeskin argues that Maimonides cannot be read correctly with the strict rig- or of formal logic. Rather, the Guide must be read as a conversation where there can only be a glimpse of the truth. In other words, this is a work in dialectic and not in mathematical logic. This is a major insight, and I think it is the single most important contribution that Seeskin makes in this work for guiding future studies of the Guide. What then are we to say about the supposed "secrets" of the Guide? Cer- tainly there must be some, since Maimonides explicitly tells us that there are. Ibn Tibbon thought that the secret is that the true Judaism is Aristotle. Strauss says al- most the same thing, that is, that Judaism and science are irreconcilable. Seeskin rejects both. For him, Maimonides' secret is that there is no knowledge, only rea- sonable belief, of some of the most central theses of both science and Judaism. In summary, note that all three authors-Kreisel, Faur, and Seeskin-claim that Maimonides is hiding something from people who are not sufficiently mature to grasp the hidden. Maturity in all three cases is epistemic. However, contrary to the Straussian tradition that has dominated Maimonidean academic scholarship since the appearance of Pines' English translation of the Guide with Strauss' in- troduction, there is no question of Maimonides' affirmation of Judaism. All agree that the Straussian line of interpretation is completely contrary to Maimonides' in- tention. Rather what is being hidden is that the most fundamental beliefs of Ju- daism cannot be demonstrated. This does not mean that these beliefs are doubted. Rather, it means that at this level of cognition it is inappropriate to speak about demonstration, and a certain amount of intellectual maturity is required to be able to believe in this way. 106</page><page sequence="15">Maimonidean Scholarship at the End of the Century What then will be the agenda of Maimonidean studies for the first half of the new century? My hope is that scholarly interest in esotericism will decline. It seems to me to be a conceptual black hole, for there is no adequate methodological way to settle the question and I doubt that there can be. Clearly Maimonides says that he will hide things and even tells us what some of them are. But he does not tell us why he is hiding them, everything that he is hiding, and how to determine what he "really" meant if he really meant anything specific. Clearly we can find contradictions in the text, but not all of them are real and, even among those that are real, it need not be the case that Maimonides himself knew that he was con- tradicting himself. In other words, there is no way to solve the problem, and un- solvable problems are best set aside in the interest of addressing real textual prob- lems that can be answered. Undoubtedly, topics will emerge from contemporary studies of which we are not yet cognizant. But certainly the central topics considered in this essay will con- tinue to occupy attention, that is, why did Maimonides write what he wrote, what is the relationship between the practical and the theoretical intellect in Mai- monides' ethics, how do both relate to his understanding of the value of commu- nal forms of worship, and what is the best reading of what he says about creation? Also clear is that interest in Maimonides' work will not decline. That is, in myjudg- ment, as it should be. The corpus of Maimonides' writings is the product of an in- tellectual genius. There are others who may be his equal, but none is greater, as the richness of interpretations surveyed in this essay illustrates. Norbert M.
