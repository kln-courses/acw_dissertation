<plain_text><page sequence="1">KURIGALZU'S STATUE INSCRIPTION Niek Veldhuis (University of California, Berkeley) During excavations at Dur-Kurigalzu (cAqar-Quf) in the 1940s the Iraqi team recovered several fragments of an inscribed diorite statue of King Kurigalzu. The inscription is by far the longest Kassite period Sumerian text, and it is therefore our prime example of what Kassite Sumerian looks like. The present article provides a new edition and translation of the text, focusing on its usage of rare Sumerian words and expressions that are known from the lexical tradition.1 1. Introduction The Kurigalzu statue was apparently destroyed in antiquity; the fragments were dispersed over several rooms of the EDugal temple. During the 1943 season, several pieces were recovered in room 25 and one in room 11 (Baqir 1944: 13). An additional fragment (Fragment B) was discovered in the second season in the palace on Mound A (Baqir 1945: 13), at some distance from the find spot of the other pieces. Fragment B shares many characteristics with the earlier finds, including the style of writing and the unusual distribution of words over several cases of text. There is no final proof, however, that the pieces found in the EDugal and the one from Mound A belong together, and therefore we may be dealing with more than one statue.2 One fragment (fig. 1), preserving part of the toes (Baqir 1944: fig. 20), indicates the original size of the object, which must have been more than life-size. By contrast, the preserved fragments are rela tively small, and we have no idea how much of the text is missing. In addition, we do not know how the text fragments relate to one another. The EDugal was the main temple of Enlil in Dur-Kurigalzu. The E3ugal complex included separate temples dedicated to Ninurta and Ninlil (Baqir 1944); in the present text Enlil and Ninlil always operate as the joint inhabitants of E3ugal. According to Clayden (1996), the Kurigalzu who appears speaking in the statue inscription is Kuri galzu I, who reigned in the first half of the fourteenth century, and who had a very active building program. The text is inscribed in an archaizing monumental script, and mentions many of the traditional gods of the Sumerian pantheon: Enlil and Ninlil, Utu, Nanna (Dilimbabbar), Nininsina, Nergal, and Inana (Ninili). Contents, script, language, and the physical object itself all convey the same message: 1. Alexa Bartelmus (Munich) meticulously read the article and offered many detailed corrections and improvements, for which I offer my sincere thanks. 2. According to A. R. George apud Clayden (1996: 116 n. 39), additional fragments of the statue have been copied by F. N. H. Al-Rawi and await publication. As far as I can tell these copies still remain unpublished. 25 JCS 60 (2008)</page><page sequence="2">26 NIEK VELDHUIS Fig 1. Fragments of the Kurigalzu statue, including the kings toes. Photograph reproduced from Baqir (1945: fig. 20). Kurigalzu is a traditional Mesopotamian king who fits perfectly in the historical patterns of kingship from time immemorial. Kurigalzu s scribes knew about the ancient Sumerian gods and largely depicted them in terms that are familiar from Old Babylonian texts. Nanna is described as the one who "lights up the night; who sleeps during the day like a lion; who reveals the signs of the night...." Inana is a goddess responsible for love, cross-dressing, and criminals: ... putting pleasure into the bedroom they gave to her as her lot. Sweet words between wife and husband, soothing outside and inside, they gave her in her hand. [...] Men who like women fasten the robe on the chest with a pin; women who like men fasten it on the heart [...]</page><page sequence="3">KURIGALZU'S STATUE INSCRIPTION 27 Those who fight with the dagger; those who are counted as criminals, and those who make evil sweet, to lead them on their ways, they (gave) to the most competent Inana as her lot. This not only recalls cross-dressing as a well-known aspect of Inanas cult (most recently discussed by B?ck 2004), but also the odd list of mes assigned to Inana in Inana and Enki (ETCSL 1.3.1), including such matters as lying and rebellion. Nergal is described as the foremost deity of the netherworld. It is likely that the passage that de scribes udug-demons who do not dress properly and do not revere the EDugal appropriately, belongs to the section about Nergal. All through the text Enlil and Ninlil act as supreme deities. Less traditional, but well known from contemporary sources, is the important role of the Igigi (written dnun-gal-e-ne; see Kienast 1965). A passage that is repeated at least four times (the only variable element being the main god s name) translates as follows: At the EDugal of heaven, the place of the broad-knowing gods (i.e., Enlil and Ninlil) the Igigi, who cannot be rivaled anywhere?they are kings of praise and holy gods?at the place of Enlil and Ninlil the Igigi, who cannot be rivaled anywhere?they are kings of praise and gods of the true mes?in their knowing hearts they perform the purification rites for DN. I am Kurigalzu, the one who made appear the EDugal wrapped in X, greatness, and praise; I have set up there the old days (to continue) into the future. The passage illustrates the rather baroque style of the inscription and summarizes its main point, iden tifying the king who restored the proper rites of a series of Sumerian gods as Kurigalzu, the very king who is standing tall before the reader. The script mimics fairly closely the monumental lapidary style of late-third to early-second millen nium inscriptions, including the use of narrow cases. Unfortunately, the inscribed fragments cannot be identified as specific parts of the king s body, so that the direction of the script remains unknown. If the object intends to copy Old Babylonian or earlier monuments, it may well have been vertical.3 Unlike early monumental texts, the cases in which the text is written do not coincide with word boundaries. Thus the preserved part of C iii begins as follows: [..jd en-l?2 dnin lilg-bi Unilingual Sumerian texts from the Kassite period are either royal inscriptions or dedication inscrip tions by high officials for the life of the king {BE 1 33; and JAOS 88, 194 BM 81-7-1, 3395). Numerous examples of inscribed bricks, door sockets, and votive objects are known from the reigns of Kurigalzu and other Kassite rulers (see Brinkman 1976). Even in its poor state of preservation the present text is by far the longest and most complex Sumerian text of the period. Writing in Sumerian was part of the message: Sumerian is the language of the ancient rulers of the land. The physical object, finally, is a statue in stone. Slanski (2000) has argued that inscribed stone objects function as monuments, signaling royal authority and perpetuity as well as the power to acquire a pre cious commodity. The colossal figure of the king certainly helped to bring that message home. Kuri galzus larger-than-life statue may have been inspired by Hammurapis law code or by other monumental art that was still around and made the presence of ancient rulers felt?until carried away by Elamite invaders. As Slanski points out, the perpetuity of an inscription on stone is related to the perpetuity of ones name, even after death. Kurigalzus preoccupation with the past is to be mirrored to the future, where he, like his predecessors, would be monumentally present. 3. BE 1 33, a cup for votive water with a dedication for the life of King Burnaburias has vertical writing.</page><page sequence="4">28 NIEK VELDHUIS 2. Kassite Sumerian Unlike most Kassite Sumerian texts, the Kurigalzu statue does not follow the well-trodden paths of formulaic dedicatory inscriptions. The challenge for ancient scribes of composing a text in this ancient language is matched by the challenge of deciphering that same text today. To some extent, these two challenges are met by using the same tools: the ancient lexicographical tradition. In many cases we may identify the source for strange and unusual words in lexical sources that were available to Kassite scribes. The present section will describe some of the features of Kassite Sumerian as they appear in the Kurigalzu statue, divided into two sections: vocabulary and orthography. While the present text pro vides many new data for a description of Kassite-period Sumerian grammar, such an analysis will not be provided here. Instead, a few interesting points will be discussed in the commentary (?4). 2.1 Words: Lexical Sources Several words in the Kurigalzu inscription are exceedingly rare and demonstrate how, in the Kassite period, lexical texts were not only used for scribal education (Veldhuis 2000), but also for composing Sumerian. A lexical composition that is well suited for such a purpose is Nabnitu, a series that was probably composed during the Kassite period. Nabnitu collects Sumerian words and expressions that are associated with the same Akkadian word (or with similar Akkadian words) and may thus have been extremely useful for locating an appropriate Sumerian term for use in an inscription.4 An example is CBS 13924 (Kassite Nippur), a fragment of a multi-column tablet that contained the entire text of Nabnitu 21 (fig. 2):5 Fig. 2. CBS 13924 (Nabnitu 21 source C; Kassite Nippur). Copy by the author. 4. For the format and function of Nabnitu, see the excellent introduction to the series by Irving Finkel in MSL 16. 5. MSL 16 189 C. The text in MSL 16 is a composite, based on several duplicates. Minor differences between my edition and the one in MSL are differences between composite and exemplar.

This number is a section total (see MSL 16 6), found with some regularity in Kassite multi-column lexical texts (see, for instance, SIT 44 obverse ii 26 and reverse i 2). If there were other section totals on this tablet they are no longer extant.</page><page sequence="6">30 NIEK VELDHUIS The obverse passage collects various Sumerian expressions that may be rendered kan?nu ("to curl up") or kannu ("pot stand"). The reverse contains expressions that translate Akkadian words for "to be bright" (nab?tu, itanbutu, and neperd?) as well as several other words that are more or less similar, such as naptum ("naphtha"). Nabnitu 21 may well have been the source of some of the Sumerian words used in the Kurigalzu inscription. Thus kar2-kar2 = itanbutu (rev. 10'; to shine brightly) and the rare expression bar-dagal = neperd? (rev. 16'; "bright"),7 both appear in Bb iii to describe the moon god (kalam-ma bar-dagal-la sag-gig-ga kar2-kar2, "Dilimbabbar... shining over the land and light ing up the black-headed people"). Nabnitu 21 may also have provided our scribe with the rare writing sulug(LUL) = naw?ru"to shine" (an alternative writing for zalag),8 used in the description of Inanas bedroom inCx (itima-bi sulug-sulug-ga). Several of the rare and unusual expressions in Kurigalzu s inscription may be traced back to other lexical series, as summarized in the following. as-bar = woman (D iii). The word as-bar is rendered amiltu ("woman") in Izi E 187 (MSL 13 189); known in exemplars from Nineveh and Assur. Old Babylonian versions do not have an entry as-bar. As far as I know the word is not used otherwise. The translation "woman" fits very well this passage that talks about men dressing as women and vice versa. dgansis = darkness (C vii). The word dgansis, written (AN)TA-gim? appears a few times in Old Babylonian lexical texts. In ProtoTzi I 25 one finds dgansis(TA-gim?), corresponding to lga]n2"sisgansis = et?tum in the bilingual version (OB Nippur). The reading gansis is confirmed by PEa 537 (but ga an-zer? in Ea IV 225). In later cuneiform gansis is also written TAxMI (Sb Vocabulary 101 and 102). A recently published Kassite exemplar of Diri 7 (Peterson 2007) has ga2-sis AN.[TA-gimw] (or, per haps, AN.[TAxMI]). I do not know of any other context attestation of TA-gun?. ki^2 6*4 = *? answer through extispicy (A viii). In standard Sumerian kig2-gi4-a means "mes senger," but in the lexical tradition it is also rendered tertu, "instruction, omen, divination result," or even am?tu, "liver" (Izi H; MSL 13 211). Thus sila4 kig2-gi4-a means "lamb suitable for extispicy;" an expression known from Ur III texts and Old Babylonian lexical lists (see Heimpel 1993: 131-33). Similarly u z u (n i g2) - k i g2 - g i4 - a is translated as amUtu or t?kaltu. The use in the present text of an expression kig2 ... gi4, with the apparent meaning "to answer by extispicy" is an artificial creation, based upon an analysis of the secondary meaning kig2-gi4-a, "omen, extispicy." The passage in A viii is an example of word play, using gi4 in three different meanings: in the expression kig2 ... gi4, and in the meanings "to answer," and "to establish" (for gi.n). ku-ku = to sleep (A v). The common word for to sleep is U3... ku-ku, frequently found in Su merian of all periods. The equation ku-ku = sal?lu is typical for texts such as Ea/Aa and is already found in the Old Babylonian period (Proto-Aa 25:4). In such cases the lexical text is to be interpreted as saying: "ku-ku is used in the expression that equals sal?lu' (that is, in U3 ... ku-ku). The use of ku-ku without u3 in connected text indicates that the scribe utilized an entry like the Proto-Aa line quoted above. TU and 1 a I3 - a - s a g4 - g a (A vi). The words TU and 1 a I3 - a - s a g4 - g a, preceded in our text by 1 u k u r and nu-gig, are exceedingly rare. Moran (1976) collected the references and concluded that both TU and lal3-a/e-sag4-ga are priestesses connected to the cult of Ninhursag/Belet-ili. In the Old Baby lonian lexical series Lu (Nippur version line 228) lai3-e-sag4-ga is found among priests and priest esses, immediately preceded by a-tu.9 In the Kes temple hymn, a composition that goes back all the 7. For bar-dagal see Sj?berg (1960: 128); PSDB bar-dagal-la; and CADN napardu, lexical section. 8. MSL 16 199:249-50; the passage is not preserved in CBS 13924. 9. The word probably also appears in MSLSS 1:108 obv. 2,13 [lal3-e-sag4] -ga (Old Babylonian Kis version) and in OECT4 160 obv. 5, 15 [lal3]-re? sag4?1-[g]a (collation by Jon Taylor).

This word appears in Ura 19, 194 (MSL 10 133; and see CAD mas?ru) and was plausibly reconstructed in lu2~azlag B (MSL 12 177 5-6). The most likely source for the expression in our text is Ura which is frequent among Kassite lexical sources, while lu2 azlag2 is attested only in the Old Babylonian period and in Hattusa. The technique of teaseling cloth by means of a thorny bush (kisiig) was discussed by Oppenheim (1948: 66). I do not know of any other context attestation of the expression. Unlike the Kurigalzu statue, most Sumerian royal inscriptions of the period are very formu laic, but the use of infrequent words, which seem to come straight from the lexical handbooks, is not unique to our text. There are a number of such examples in a Kassite period bilingual pub lished as PBS 1/1 11 (CBS 11341; edited by Westenholz 2005).11 Reverse line 4 reads za3-mi2 ad sa abbununnu(UD.MUDNUN.NA) "lyre song wailing12 the eclipse" (unfortunately the Akkadian trans lation is lost), The word abbununnu is otherwise known exclusively from various recensions of Diri. The Ugarit version, approximately contemporary with our text, includes the following entries (Diri Ugarit 1,110-13; MSL 15 71): ab-bu-nun-nu UD.MUD.NUN.NA.KI13 nird? sin bartum rebellion antal? eclipse ?mu daDmu dark day Of these renderings, ?mu daDmu ("dark day") goes back to the Old Babylonian Nippur version of the list (MSL 15 24:330); the other entries specify or interpret the meaning of the Sumerian term. The scribe of this bilingual apparently copied this word straight from his Diri exemplar. 2.2 Writing: Archaisms and Syllabic Spelling The orthography of the Kurigalzu statue inscription displays numerous peculiarities. Some of these are (more-or-less successful) attempts at archaizing, others are syllabic spellings. An example of an orthographic archaism is - m e - e n3 (instead of - m e - e n) for the first person copula (C iv), using the orthography of certain Sulgi royal hymns (see Klein 2000). Very curious is the use of us5(U3) for the writing of the plural marker /es/ in /u/-verbs in C ii, viii and ix.14 The reading is confirmed by comparison with other verbal forms in this passage: C viii mu-un-na-an-sum2-mu4-us5 ib2-si-si-is C ix mu-un-na-an-sum2-mu4-us5 mu-un-na-an-du3-us5 10. For this text, see most recently Wilcke (2006). For TU and lal3-a-sag4-ga see further Sallaberger (2005: 635-36). 11. Westenholz attributes the text to the Old Babylonian period, but this seems very unlikely. The format of the bilingual (Sumerian and Akkadian side by side, rather than interlinear) is typical for the Kassite period. The odd mix of earlier and later sign forms shows that the scribe tried to imitate an earlier script, as did the scribe of the Kurigalzu statue. 12. Syllabic for ad sa^ 13. The sign complex appears as UD.MUD.NUN.NA, UD.MUD.NUN.NA.KI or UD.MUD.NUN.KI. 14. Perhaps also in Ba i 3'-4', reading mi-in - [... -m] U4?-us5.</page><page sequence="8">32 NIEK VELDHUIS All these verbal forms are plurals?as indeed are most verbs in this text. By contrast, A v has the regular writing ba-ra-an-sum2-mu-us. The concentration of these odd - (mu4) -uS5 forms in two successive columns makes one wonder whether more than one scribe was responsible for the writing on the statue. Whether this writing was meant as an attempt at archaizing remains unclear, but it certainly looks like it. A similar form is al-nu2-nu2-U8-due-ba (C vi), where us and dug are used syllabically. Examples of syllabic writing are more numerous: su-hu-ul for suhul (A ii; "herd"), [za]-ra-ah for zarah (A vi; "wailing"); za ... sa for zag ... sa4 (A vii etc.; "to rival"); and se gal for esQ gal (C x; "great shrine"). Concentrations of syllabic writings are attested in C iii and in C v. In C iii we find gis zal for gizzal ("wisdom"), NI-NI for NU-NU ("to spin") and su-ur2 for sur ("to twine") in a single sentence. A few writings seem to indicate that the scribe had sign names in mind rather than the appro priate readings. The dative dnanna-ir-ra(A vii) is rather puzzling, and so is the plural mu-na-sa2 is (A vii and C iv; but bi2-in-si-sa2-es2 in D vi). One wonders whether in some way dnanna-ir-ra reflects a reading dses-ki-ir-ra and mu-na-sa2-is a reading mu-na-di-is. 3. Text and Translation The text was first published shortly after its discovery by Kramer et al. (1948).15 Notwithstanding its considerable interest, it has been all but ignored for more than half a century. Kramer acknowledged that much of his reading and translation was preliminary due to the fragmentary nature of the text, and the unusual Sumerian. The present edition has to make the same disclaimer. Almost sixty years later much more of the text may be understood, but at least as much is still unclear or open to different interpretations. In addition to Kramers edition, I have consulted the unpublished transliteration by Margaret Green, referenced as Kurigalzu Inscription in the PSD volumes. I wish to thank John Carnahan, Terri Tanaka, and Laurie Pearce for reading through the text with me, and for many insightful suggestions and corrections. Kurigalzus inscription is presented here in transliteration and translation, following the order of fragments as designated by Kramer. Fragment A v talks about Nanna, and Bb iii mentions Dilimbabbar, another name of the moon god. Similarly, fragments C ix and D iv mention Inana, "the most competent one" (an-zib2). It is likely that such passages belong together, but how they are to be arranged is not clear, and no attempt has been made to establish the relationships between the fragments in more detail. Fragments Ba and Bb are different surfaces of the same fragment. Again, the textual relationship between these surfaces remains unclear. Kramers publication includes photographs of all the pieces; additional photographs were pub lished in Baqir 1944 and Baqir 1945. Occasionally, collation from these photographs has solved minor problems in the copies. In general the copies seem reliable. 15. Kramers translation is also published in James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testa ment (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950), 57-59.</page><page sequence="9">KURIGALZU'S STATUE INSCRIPTION Fragment A = IM 050009 (figs. 3,4) A i "traces" Aii 1'.

Commentary Fragment A Aii 7'-11' For digir un3-na see Volk (1995: 177), who argues that "high gods" refers to constellations and planets. The writing su-hu-ul is syllabic for s u h u 1 (SU2.MUL) which, following a sug gestion by Civil (1994: 141-47) may well equal sugullu, "herd" and thus be equivalent to (or a variant of) suhub2(SU2.MUL).17 Herd, in this context, refers again to stars and su2 equals erepu, "to become dark; clouded." 17. This may well be another instance of two similar words, suhul and suhub2 written by the same sign combination SU2.MUL (compare kalag/kal, zig?/zid, etc.). The most satisfying solution would be suhul = sugullu = herd and suhub? = suhuppatu = boot and suhuppu = rim of a wheel, assuming that in both cases the Akkadian words are loans. However, the read ing suhub? in the expression gud suhub? (herding oxen) seems well founded; see Civil (1994: 141-47).</page><page sequence="21">KURIGALZU S STATUE INSCRIPTION 45 Fig. 11. Fragment D (IM 50011). Photograph reproduced from Kramer and Baqir (1948). The phrase digir un?-na-ke^ne su-hu-ul-la2"bi is an example of the Kassite form of the anticipatory genitive, which is always constructed with -bi, independent of the gender of the possessor. The construction does not require a genitive morpheme and the two nouns thus joined are not necessarily contiguous. Other examples in this text are: A viii: digir-re2-ne kug-kug-ga ug-bi "the pure gods' ewe." Bb iii: ddil-im2-babbar2 an uras-ta si-bi "Dilimbabbars horns (cover) heaven and earth." In these constructions -bi apparently translates Akkadian sa, which is also gender independent. The distinction between animate and inanimate is not abandoned; see, for instance, sag-gig ga me-lam2-a-ni su4-su4~a "(Nanna) covers the black-headed people with his rays." A iii l'-2' For ga2"la ... dag (partly restored here) = "to cease, to be negligent" and its use in royal lit erature see Tinney (1996: 183). 5'-6' The form NE.NE-a-as is also found in C x; in both contexts "to renew" (reading gibil4 g i b i 14) appears to make sense, although one would rather expect g i b i 1 ^ - g i b i 1 ^ -1 a - a s. 7'-8' The compound igi... zu equals udd?, and may be translated as "to appoint" or as "to reveal." 9'-10' The ablative inda-ga-an kur-kur-ra-ta almost certainly carries locative meaning (in all the lands). Lexical texts provide ample attestations of ta = ina or ana. A iv The subject of the verbs remains unknown. Is this a passage comparable to the beginning of Enuma Elis, where the great gods give tasks to lesser gods? Av 6'-8' For gu3 ... sum2 = rag?mu, "to roar" see Karahashi (2000: 111-12).</page><page sequence="22">46 NIEK VELDHUIS A vi l'-2' The suffix -bi-ne-ne is a plural formation of the inanimate possessive -bi (see Poebel GSG p. 77). This suffix appears relatively frequently in late lexical texts, where it is translated by - sunu. An example is the entry ki-la2-bi-ne-ne = su-qul-ta-su^-nu (Ura I 47). An early attes tation of the form is found in CBS 186218 rev. ii 19' (a late Old Babylonian copy of Ura I-II, probably, from the Sippar area), which differentiates between - a-ne-ne (as a plural of -ani) and -bi-ne-ne (as a plural of -bi): Obv. ii 35'-37' (|| Ura I 144-147) su-ti-a income su-ti-a-ni his income su-ti-a-ne-ne their income Rev. hT7'-19' (|| Ura II 353-355). gu?-un load gU2_un-bi its load gU2-un-bi-ne-ne their load 4'-6' The copy has SAL.DIS, but the photograph clearly shows lukur (SAL.ME). For the priestly titles TU and lal?-a-sag^ga see above ?2.1. 8'-10' For giskim ... dug4 = "to recognize," see Attinger (1993: 547-50). 11'-12' The expression i-si-is la2 is used for "to laugh," or "to moan" (see Jaques 2006). 13'-14' The word si-si-ig equals, among many other things, sahurratum ("deadly silence"), which makes a good pair with ni2 = puluhtum ("fear"). Throughout the text - bi is used as a coordinat ing particle (fear and deadly silence). 15' The expression nam-mi2"US2-sa2 ... ak in Ur III ditillas means "to act as brother-in-law," which does not make much sense here. Perhaps Sumerian nam-mi2"US2-sa2 represents the Akkadian abstractum em?tum here, which may mean "wedding." 20' Instead of [za] - ra-ah ("wailing;" usually written zarah = SAG.PA.LAGAB) one may also re construct [la] -ra-ah = "difficulty" {pusqu). A vii This passage is repeated at several places in the text; the only variable element being the name of a major god for whom hand washing rites are performed. The other occurrences are C iv and vi and D v. 24'-26' The expression za ... sa is an unorthographic writing for zag ... sa2/sa4 = san?nu 1/2 = "to rival," or "to compete." 44'-45' The verb da-da-ra means "to clothe," or "to tie" (see Lambert 1973: 279). The passage, which describes how Kurigalzu clad the temple EDugal in greatness(?) and praise(?) may not be fully reconstructed; it is partly preserved here and in C iv: A vii C iv e2-u-gal [..

Note that in this same column one finds digir engur-ra gi4-gi4-da-ne, "the always an swering gods of the Engur" where the plural is placed at the end, as in standard Sumerian (also C vii dnun-gal gal-gal-a-ne). Word order within the noun phrase is freer in Kassite Sumerian. 10' The form bi2"gi4-gi4 is a writing for gi.n = kunnu (to establish), as often in late bilinguals. 17'-19' This phrase is entirely unclear to me. 26" In the translation, zag-zag-ga is taken as a writing for sagg-sagg-ga, but this seems dubious. Fragment Ba This passage talks about the statue itself (column ii). The reading ug? sar2"[ra] in column iii is questionable. Fragment Bb Bb ii No full verbal form is preserved so that it is impossible to understand the sentence structure. The pas sage talks about creating the "small watches" and designing months of thirty days. This column and the next reference the moon god and may have to be connected with A v-vii, but the spatial relation re mains unclear. Bb iii 3/-7/ The phrase ddil-im2-babbar2 an uras-ta si-bi su4-su4-a must mean "Dilimbabbars horns cover heaven and earth," but what the function is of the ablative - ta remains unclear. IT For bar-dagal see above ?2.1. Fragment C Cii 21/-23/ For the writing -mu4-us5 see ?2.2 and the form mu-un-na-an-suni2-mu4-us5 in C viii and C ix. In the present case, the reconstruction m u - [n i] - i n - [s u m2] - m u4 - u S5 is problematic, because one hardly expects the verb sum2 without a dative. Ciii 23'-30' The writing gis-zal is for gizzal (ear, wisdom, understanding). NI-NI may be for nu-nu.r (to spin) and su-ur2 for sur ("to spin," or "twist"). The theme of good clothing is turned into its opposite in C v, where unruly demons are described as having no proper clothing. C iv l'-25' These lines contain the second instance of the repeated passage; see at A vii for further com mentary. 27'-31' The signs KUN KA are almost certainly to be read ma?2-sag, "foremost." In A ix the expres sion uz3-sag appears, with the same meaning. Etymologically, the words mean "head billy goat" and "head she-goat" respectively, but no such gender differentiation seems implied by our text. The dative postposition in ^e?-iriiT-gal-ra ma?2-sag kur-rais placed before the qualifier (incorrectly according to standards of earlier Sumerian).</page><page sequence="24">48 NIEK VELDHUIS Cv This column continues the passage about Nergal at the end of column iv, discussing (netherworld) demons who do not honor the EDugal properly. l'-2' Perhaps to be read gU3~bi!(GA) ra-ah: shouting. 3'-6' The verb si?.(k) is taken here as the equivalent of sap?nu, "to destroy." The verb su2~ru equals par?ru/purruru = "to scatter, to rupture." 9'-12' The phrase a2 g i s - n a2 - k a si-si-da remains unclear to me. 13'-16' For tug2 kisii?-kisiie ur3 see above ?2.1 19' The writing za-ra is syllabic for zara^ (TIL.AS) = "(braided) garment." 20/-22/ The word tu-tu-da equals Akkadian dudittum, "togglepin." Various Sumerian spellings are known (du-di-da;tu-di-tum, etc.), but tu-tu-da is not otherwise attested. C vi l'-10' It is likely that this passage still talks about netherworld affairs and that sleeping in the earth is a euphemism for death. The rest of this column contains the third installment of the repeated passage; see A vii. C vii 7b'-9' For dg a n s i s see above ?2.1. 10' The meaning and reading of this phrase are unclear to me. 20'-21' The name dnin-i3-li also appears in C ix, where it is used interchangeably with dInana. This identity is confirmed by An = Anum I 30 where dnin-i3-li is equated with An-tum dIs-tar (Litke 1998: 25). The word or words preceding this name remain unclear. C viii This column talks about Nin-i3-li/Inana in her role as goddess of love. 14' The GIS ingis-sub-se3 looks like KU in the copy but is clear on the photograph. 15'-17' For mu-un-na-an-sum2-mu4!(KU)-us5(U8) see ?2.2. C ix r The sign ZIB2 is written TUM-gimw. Modern sign lists usually describe ZIB2 as NINDA2xES, which is the form of the sign in the first millennium. In third-millennium paleography the sign belongs to the TUM family (see Civil 1983; Westenholz OSPI 135 with commentary; and Alster 1991-1992: 26) and the Old Babylonian sign is usually TUMxES (although NINDA2xES is attested as well; see Mittermayer 2006, no. 140). The writing TUMxES survives in Middle Assyrian Ea (see MSL 14 454) and apparently also in first millennium Aa, but the passage is badly broken (MSL 14 464). 4'-18' For mu-un-na-an-sum2-mu4-us5 and mu-un-na-an-du3"US5 see ?2.2. Cx 12'-13' se gal is a writing for es3 gal. 14-15' For NE.NE-a-as (gibil4-gibil4-a-as), see also A iii 5'-6'. Fragment D Diii l'-4' The word dara4~ra-asis interpreted as a spelling for da-da-ra-as, "to clothe," (see com mentary at A vii 44'-45'), but not without misgivings. The main reason for this interpretation</page><page sequence="25">KURIGALZU'S STATUE INSCRIPTION 49 is that the continuation of the column talks about clothing and toggle pins. The word order of the Sumerian seems badly scrambled. 5' For as-bar = woman (amiltu) see above ?2.1 6' The present reading assumes that the passage refers to a ritual wrestling match with gender inversion (for ritual wrestling, see Keetman 2008 with further literature). The sign combi nation GIS.RU may write various words: gis-sub riot"), ^illar (a weapon), ^i?gespu ("hoop; wrestling"). The word gis-sub appears in C viii (gis-sub-se?) and D iv (gis-sub-ba-na) but does not seem to make much sense here. The form of the terminative (written - as) may reflect the reading gespa (RU), as in P-Ea 600 (all other examples of -as for the terminative in this text are preceded by the vowel /a/). 7'-19' In this passage the text uses a very archaic form of the sign LU2; column iv features the more regular form. Why this is the case is unclear. Div 2'-4' The writing ba-ad-ra for ba-da-ra ("dagger") is attested in Ninmesara 108 (see Zgoll 1997: 481). For the expression tes2-bi gu7 "to fight" see Michalowski (1989: 70), ir-15' The word ki-in-DU (m?laku, pad?nu; see Klein 1981: 92-93) is to be read ki-in-gub here. I do not know of any other firm evidence for the reading of the final sign.
