Introduction This report describes a two-faced or "Janus" tiki, currently displayed in an open-air collection of arcneoiogicai sculpture ana rocK art in tne v_,atnonc mission yard inTaioha'e, Nuku Hiva, Marquesas. In addition to the Janus head, the tiki is unusual in sev eral respects: it is sculptured from a natural basalt column, it displays features that differ markedly from the traditional Marquesan artistic canon, ^ _ 1 C _ _ : :C.: • \ a _ „ J ap^v,aio iw uv i ci a^v&gt; 10 ii,iai\.|uv.oaii) aiiu is associared wirh marine faunal remains, indicarinp a possibility of some form of current veneration of the figure (see Figs.i through 4). Description The Janus tiki, colloquially referred to as Mata Peto ("dog face")1 by the Marquesans because of the pro iprnncr cranina iawc nf its nnnnsina fares. wac rerov ered by the local inhabitants of the valley of A'akapa on the north coast of Nuku Hiva, and brought to the mission yard in Taioha'e more than 40 years ago. It was produced by sculpting the opposing sides or the upper end of a natural column of reddish-brown vesirular hasalr.

It has occupied various places in the mission yard, but currently stands on the sea-side terrace or the residence or Msgr. Guy Chevalier, current Bishop of the Marquesas. The upper 3 or the hgure is exposed, having been set into the veranda surface to an indeterminate depth.2 Small stones in a thin layer of concrete have been placed around the base to stabilize the figure. Facial Features The face is the most interesting part of this tiki. The cwo raccs are at an angic 01 approximaieiy i^u-iou degrees, presently facing roughly landward and sea — — demarcation separating the heads, as is seen in other portable or monumental Marquesan Janus tiki: they share a single ovoid "calvarium." Both faces have cir cular concave eyes; low-bridged, flat, straight-sided noses, with rlaring nostrils; receding brows; prog nathous jaws; and gaping mouths with inner edges nrohahlv renresenrinp reerh Therp are nn inrlira tions of ears. Despite the similarities between the Fares, however, rhere are also imnnrranr inrlivirlnal differences. Landward Face The lower left jaw of this face is broken off. There is a pronounced supraorbital ridee. On the rieht side of the nose, a line extends diagonally from the base of the nose to a point on the cheek next to the corner of the open mouth. There are faint traces of „ i:.™ J: •i i_ b wb b from this line to the side of the head. There is a trace Figure i. Mata Peto: view from the west. At base, Murex shell at left; coral and bivalve on right, (photo by L. Humphrey) io Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="2">of an inner ridge in the portion of the mouth that remains. Below the neck, the land side figure bulges out somewhat; this may be an attempt to portray breasts,^ or it may simply be an unaltered contour of the original basalt column. There are no other indications of anatomical features below the neck. Seaward Face The seaward face has a slightly damaged nose. It lacks a brow ridge, but has a steeply receding brow similar to tnat or tne landward race, l ne unusual rea tures of this face include two pairs of lines; one pair on each side of the nose (extending from eves to mouth), and an inner edge or rim within the gap ing mouth (possibly representing teeth). Discussion Material Mata Peto was sculpted from basalt, as opposed to the softer and more easily worked red volcanic tuff fkr'etu) used in other monumental Marauesan images. The only other monumental basalt image known to us is the image of the god Hu'upeke on the well-known ceremonial site in Ta'a'oa, in Hiva Figure 2. Seaward face, (photo by L. Humphrey) Oa (Suggs 1961: PI.8a). Hu'upeke is carved in low relief on a cylindroid basalt column, and has all the characteristics or the conventional Marquesan tiki motif.4 This image stands in a large ceremonial site iiiLuipuiauiig uic iaicbi reacures or norinern Marquesan ceremonial architecture, such as the enciosea wnua ^ceremonial piaza; ana tne tu u orrer : i_r i c i l i_. j c. .1. _ pianui in, anu liiv.iv.iwiv. uaiv.o uuiii liiv_ early 18th century. Monumental Januform Sculpture The only other currently known monumental Janus tiki stands in the Pa eke site5 inTaipivai, Nuku Hiva. This image, sculptured from coarse red volcanic tuff (ke'etu), is characterized by a single body in conven tional Marquesan form, with two laterally oriented faces senarated bv a proove which nasses over the head.

At that time the Janus tiki, which was identified to von den isteinen as ruamama u etua, was lying near a large, well-preserved tiki (identified as One'ua), which was standing in the front wall of the western uphill platform.7 When photographing One'ua, von den Steinen inadvertently included part of the Janus tiki in the photograph, document ing its location at that time. He did not notice the Janus tiki until he was ready to leave the site, at which time his guide became upset and prevented further investigation or photography of the tiki.8 Chronological Placement Modem archeological excavations can provide only the most imprecise context for dating Mata Peto. Radiocarbon dates from excavations at Pa eke, Te I'i d • « i_r* r\~ adze quarry sice in Ha'a'upa'upa, on Nuku Hiva (Suggs 1961:87, Site NHuu 1), have shown that mon umental tuff stone sculpture in the "typical" Marquesan canon appeared in both the northern 1 1 f.l L:„„1 c Ar&gt; and probably not until the 18th century, thus sup porting von den Steinen's conclusion (based on I • . 1 : OA 1 : C ^.AliauoiiYV. v_uili^aiatiYjiuuivo wa liiv_ ^v»nv.aivy^iv.j ui the builders of the site) that Te I'i Pona was built 1 1 ~ AH ( C .

Major fie ures of the Polynesian pantheon, such as Tangaroa and Atea, were revered in the Marquesas in various forms, but many Marquesan gods were deified deceased tau'a (insnirarional chiefs), chiefs, senior females, and women who died in childbirth.15 One Figure 5.

Januform Characters in Marquesan Traditions Marquesan ethnographic information provides scant information to assist in the identification of the entity represented by Mata Peto. Aside from Paumama'u etua, the only other Janus god that has hppn rlpfinirplv irlpnnfipH frnm rhp K/farnn^ccic ic 3 minor god from a peripheral valley of Fatu Hiva.1^ For example, pairs of individual figures originating from brothers ^ were present on Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa. and I Ja Pou. When rhe F.iironeans arrived, these groups were locked in chronic warfare, but there is a possibility that the Janus statue dates from a peri od before hostilities arose between the two divisions and in some wav represent the common ancestry of Nuku Hiva's original inhabitants. There are also leg ends of two huge legendary freshwater eels, known as "The two big eels" (Te 'ua kue'e nui), who lived in the pool at the base of the northernmost waterfall in Taipivai, The relation, if anv, of these creatures to the Marquesan pantheon is unclear at this time. Polynesian Comparisons In general, dualism pervades the entire Polynesian world-view (Johnson 1981:27-32), appearing iiiruugiiuui Licauun Liianib, gcucaiugicb, myuiuiu gy, and traditions. This dualism may express itself in concepts of natural forces in opposition and/or bal ance, e.g., ligne ana aarttness, eartn ana SKy. it may also be expressed in the concept of a given clan or tribe as beinp the summation of all those, livinp and dead, who share a common descent (e.g., the peo pie or te ao ana cne people or iepo). /\t scin anotn er level of symbolism the ceremonial symbols of authority, which are often decorated with paired images, may represent the chiefs right to represent July 1995 13</page><page sequence="5">and soeak for the bilaterial lines of descent.21 Given the pervasive nature of dualistic formulations, it is j &amp; j t&gt; ri — Polynesian art. What is surprising is that they are not more prevalent. The literature on the cultures of the Tuamotu archipelago, baster Island, and riawai 1 — believed to be the closest relatives of Marquesan culture, sheds some light on tne significance ana antiquity _r t _ r- • ] t? _ v.; I jdiiuo ii^uiv-o 111 iuc i»iaivjuv.oaj anu i—.cio r* 1 • T 1 T 1*1 .1 i uiy u cold. ill l 11 v_ ± iidinuiu div-nipi-id^w u 1^.1 v. ia ample evidence of a large number of paired gods, beginning with the controversial Kiho/Kio,22 whose appellations inciuae a numDer or unes witn gram matical particles or modifiers referring to duality ciirh ic vtrrn (rh nliirol nrpHv- *=&gt; cr visr/i sip Ytrrsi /itu/t o v r i o - o o ngâ ea, ngâ rangi, ngd hatu).

WI1 U1 hatu with dual particles and modifiers in the Tuamotus indicates that Tangaroa may have been seen as a dual entity in at least some parts of Eastern Polynesia. The Stimson dictionary (Stimson and Marshall 1964) contains several names for other less er gods and demons including the modifier rua. iuamotu appellations ror tne goa Kongo vpairea withTangaroa on Rapa Nui, see below) also include references to duality, e.g. Rongo na rua hatu, Rongo na rua nuku.

On Easter Island, Janus- and double-headed rep resentations of men, birds, and mammals with gap ing mouths are rather common in the rongorongo script. A significant group of portable anthropo morphic statues and ornaments show Janus and double heads as well. * rteads on single-bodied Easter Island Janus and double-headed figures face straight ahead.25 Tanus heads also aDDear on the ends of Easter Island ua and paoa staffs, which were important symbols of authority (Fedorovna I993:128-i29). Lavachery (1939: Pl.XXI, Figs.288, 289, 300) illustrates three petroglyphs that might be said to be two-dimensional Janus faces in his study of Easter Island petroglyphs.2(&gt; These petroglyphs L.UI1M51 uj. pana in rnuKcrnuKC niaàK.5, byiiiiiiciiiccuiy i*i ... . «. . dlldllgCU Willi llUàCà puillllllg 111 UippUMlC UHCLUUU5.

The rock is situated so that as the viewer changes position, the second face appears. In her exhaustive studies of Easter Island myths and traditions, I. K. Fedorovna (ibid.) interprets the Janus or twin sculptures of Easter Island as general ly expressing the "principal idea of the myth of the divine twins, Tangaroa and Rongo, and, simultane nnçlv as a dnaliçnr rpnrpçpnrannn nF rhp rlrmhlp nature of the god Tangaroa, who seemingly appears here in two essential natures: in his own role, and in the role of Roneo's elder twin brother." Fedorovna (ibid.) believes that "in the latest versions of ~~ i c ~r ] / '^ Tangaroa and Rongo were transformed, and on Fasrpr Island Rnncrn wa&lt;: rransfnrmerl inrn rhp mn ofTangaroa, the founder of a dynasty of high chiefs of Rapanui. The ariki henna of Easter Island were considered to be the descendants ofTangaroa, and, in accordance witn tne concepts or tne îsianaers, ais posed of special reproductive powers." Fedorovna maintains that the Janus representations on Easter Island symbols of authority reinforce the chief's con nprfirtn rh Tin rri mi onrl -imnlifir flio cnonnl r\r\ixr_ ers over nature that are the result of that connection. She notes that human twins held special status on Raster Island and received roval names from rhe ariki henna in special ceremonies. Janus figures, strictly defined, are very rare in Hawaiian art, the only example beine a double-bod ied wooden figure found in 1976 at Kona (Kaeppler 1979:18). Other Hawaiian statues and anthropo morphic images on artifacts such as bowls, soear racks, games boards, etc. however, often display the . 1 . . • • 1.1 gaping îiiuuuio, pivjji~v*(.iug jdwo, auu Lttiti ov_^ii i_»n Mata Peto.

Maori art also features images with gap ing mouths and prominent teeth. In Tikopia pairs of deities or deities with dual aspects play major roles in the principal clans, emphasizing the antiquity of dual-aspect gods in Polynesian culture.

White is the tapu color in the Marquesas; therefore, natural substances like bleached coral mignt well be expect ed around ceremonial sites. In fact, white or grayish stone was frequently used in the construction of cer emonial sites. 29 The best information available on the ceremoni al significance of coral in the Marquesas is found, as usual, in von den Steinen,3° who describes two uses of coral in a religious or ritual context.

It appears that coral was also somehow associated with worship of a sea god or gods since it is unlikely that any materials used on ceremonial sites lacked ceremonial signifi cance. In his collection of children's drawings, von den Steinen also shows a sketch which his informant claimed portrayed a woman with a black face wear ing a hat decorated with coral (pae feYoSuch hats must have been very few in number, and rarely used, for none have turned up in ethnographic col lections, and no descriptions have been found in the i •. t-1 *. r i i • i • 11 111V.1ÛIU1L. 1 lit Idlll-V VJL U1V_ lldLO IXlUlLdLti llldL lilt contexts in which such hats were worn were likely ceremonial.

The oyster shell at the base of Mata Peto may rep resent a genus that is now considered extinct in the Marquesas, since questions directed to Marquesans during the 1950s, and again in 1993, failed to elicit a Marquesan name tor these bivalves or any knowl edge of them.

Notes 1. Information on the colloquial name of the tiki, its original location, and the circumstances of installation in its current location were furnished by Msgr. H.-M. Le Cléach, former Bishop of the Marquesas, in an interview in Tahiti, 21 October 1994. 2. The image is 24" wide at the base, tapering to a width of 13" at the narrowest point of the neck, and expanding to 24" at the open jaws, which is the widest part of the head. The top of the head is an irregular oval, 13" by 14". 3. The literature is equivocal on the manner of indi cating gender in tiki. Some tiki may have been emasculated in recent times. This perhaps accounts for the statement by von den Steinen that the statue of Oneua on the Pa'eke site, Taipivai, is supposedly female, but that it appeared to have a scrotum (Steinen i928ii:74-86). Linton (1923:115-116) identifies all of the tiki on the Pa'eke site as female, at least partially based on pectoral relief. On the other hand, tiki in the southern Marquesas frequently show male genitalia. 4. The traditional Marquesan canon is described in detail by Handy (1938:29). 5. Also known locally as "Vaitaviri," a place name that resonates in Easter Island myths of the god Tangaroa (see Fedorovna 1993:148). Although not listed as a me'ae in the list compiled by Pére Chaulet and published in Delmas (1927:97-98), it appears that the site was in fact a tribal temple 16 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="8">with figures of gods of all, or most, of the Taipi sub-stribes. 6. The images photographed by von den Steinen (i928(ii):Fig-57, p.77) were built into the south ern faces of two medium-sized stone house plat forms standing on the uphill or northern side of the site. A third large stone platform with tiki stands directly in front of these two platforms and downhill (south) from them. Von den Steinen does not mention the lower platform or its fig ures, and apparently was not shown them. 7. Ferdon (n.d.) cites von den Steinen, but confus es the two tiki, identifying the Janus tiki as One'ua, and the standing tiki as Puamama'u 'Etua. Von den Steinen (i9z8(ii):Figs.56, 57) is quite clear about the identity of these two images, showing photos of Oneua and further stating that Puamama'u 'Etua was located "...einige Schritten von Oneua entfernt mit der Gesichtsseite aufdem Boden liegend..., " ("a few paces removed from Oneua, lying face down on the original ground") as can be seen in the lower left hand corner of Figure 57 in ibid. Names for the figures collected by Ferdon do not agree with those obtained by von den Steinen, and are regarded as unreliable on the basis of their source and col lection circumstances. 8. Von den Steinen {i^zS(u):j4-j6) noted that his inability to investigate Puamamau'etua further caused him some concern, since the 'etua suffix of the name indicted to him that the figure might have some importance. The name may be trans lated as "god of the shadow people," or "divine shadow people." Puama'u was the name of a tohua or ceremonial plaza in Taipivai associated with the me'ae Meitahi, sacred to the god Hue'utu. Unfortunately, nothing further is known about the me'ae or the god. The identifi cation of the statue as "Puamamau'etua" may have resulted from inaccurate recording of an informant's statements, identifying the statue as "the god of Puama'u" (o ta Puama'u etua), through ignorance of the real name, or through disinclination to reveal the real name. "Puama'u" in the god name may also refer to the valley of Puama'u, Hiva Oa, as there is evidence of possi ble links between the Taipi tribe (including the Hatiheu subdivision) and the valleys of Puama'u and Hanamenu on the north coast of Hiva Oa. This evidence takes the form of shared names for other ceremonial sites: a) An important temple in Hatiheu is named Te I'i Poka, while the well known monumental sculpture site in Puama'u (listed by Delmas as a burial site) bears the south ern dialect form of what appears to be the same name: I'i Pona. Linton (1923:159), who spoke no Marquesan, gives the name of this site as "Oipona." Exact comparison of these names is rendered difficult by irregularities in both Delmas and Linton's orthography; b) Hikoku'a, the large tohua in Hatiheu, has counterparts in both Puama'u and Hanamenu on Hiva Oa (Delmas 1927:97-104). If the name Puamama'u 'Etua is to be interpreted as a geographic refer ence to Puama'u Valley in Hiva Oa, it may be a further reflection ofsome special ceremonial con nection between the northern and southern Marquesas. No Janus figures appear in the mon umental sculpture of Puama'u, however. 9. See Suggs 1961: Fig.30a, and pp. 182-184 f°r fur~ ther discussion of possible sporadic interarchi pelago contacts during this period. 10. The NHi 1 head is rather similar to the heads of portable god figures from Samoa and Tonga; see for example Hiroa (1935:85 cf.). 11. For purposes of this paper, the authors prefer to avoid the problem of whether Janus and "Siamese-twin" figures should be considered as related ways of representing the same underlying concepts. i2-.Steinen (1928(H)). A variety of paired and grouped tiki representations also appear in small bone tiki and carved earplugs. 13. For a detailed description and chronological study of changes in 'u'u decorative styles, see Ivory (1994). The Januform heads on clubs may be interpreted as providing protection toward both the front and rear of the carrier, see Ivory (ibid.), note 21, for possibly related information from Easter Island. 14. Steinen (1928(10:156-157). The only available background information on the identities of the portable Janus figures in Marquesan ethnologi cal collections is that collected by von den Steinen. The artifacts on which he provides iden tification generally represent pairs of individuals (gods or mortals), although some Janus figures represent only one person. Whether pairs or indi July 1995 17</page><page sequence="9">viduals are represented by Janus tiki, they are gen erally either chiefs or gods. And when two indi viduals are represented on portable Janus tiki, there is no differentiation between the features of the faces. 15. Suggs (1961:190). My colleague, David Spetrino, has suggested that the Janus tiki form may have been a representation of so-called Siamese twins or other birth anomalies. This suggestion has def inite merit, given the attention that the Marquesans gave to birth complications, as indicted by their practice of deifying women who died in childbirth, but it does not explain the dif ferences in facial treatment, which seem to rep resent tattoo designs normally associated with adult males. 16. There is, for example, evidence that a god's lack of body decoration was explicitly noted in leg end; e.g., in Ua Pou, the god Atua Heato, who worshipped in the major me'ae Te Menaha Taka'oa in Hakamoui, was described as having no tattoos. See Steinen I928(iii):7i. 17. I.e., portrait art was unknown. 18. Von den Steinen records a legend concerning one portable Janus statue recovered from Ouia, Fatu Hiva. The statue is said to represent the god Tohiau who was worshipped on me'ae Pakua in that valley. Tohiau's Januform head allowed him to sit on a mountain pass above Ouia and simul taneously watch both ways at once (Steinen 192.8(iii):88). This legend resembles the Easter Island legend of Nga Rauhiva Aringa Erua, a Janus-headed Easter Islander. Son of the culture hero Kainga, Nga Rauhiva was killed in the Tuu Hotu Iti war when his two heads failed to coop erate properly in acting against an approaching enemy. 19. On Nuku Hiva, the division designated as Te I'i nui a Haku included all the tribes on the south ern and western valleys (Taioha'e, Haka'ui, Ha'apa'a, A'akapa) and Taipi nui a Vaku consist ed of the tribes of the northeastern valleys (Taipi, Ho'oumi, Ha'atuatua, Anaho, and Hatiheu). 20.This may be seen in those poignant moments in modern Maori ceremonial protocol, when a group of strangers entering a foreign marae pause to remember their dead, and to honor the dead of the host marae. 2i.Eddowes, Mark. Personal communication, March, 1994. 22.Stimson (1933). Stimson and Marshall (1964). Kiho/Kio is cited here because one of us (RCS) gained an appreciation of the academic and inter personal issues underlying this bitter debate through extended discussion with both protago nists (Emory and Stimson), and is strongly inclined to generally support Stimson's reporting and conclusions, as opposed to those of Emory. 23.E.g., Te hatu moanalte fatu maora, i.e., "the lord of the sea" is a common epithet forTaka'oa, and appears in the well-known traditional chant: "Ua rere te manu. " 24.Heyerdahl 1973:42-43, 138, 198, 200, 214; Plates 97-103. Heyerdahl (ibid.:57~58) states that portable moai ma'ea, some of which were two faced, were noted in Easter Island houses by Geiseler in 1882. However, no references to dou ble-headed or Janus sculptures, actually desig nated as moai eringa vs. moai ma'ea, appear in Geiseler, 1883 (see specifically, pp. 14, 31-32). Some purported examples of the two-headed sculptures were recovered by Heyerdahl (i973:Pls. 213, 214) in 1956 but the circumstances surrounding their production and use are ques tionable. It is interesting that one of these figures is said to represent the two-headed character of the Tuu-Hotu Iti war, Nga Rauhiva Aringa Erua (see Note 19). 25. The Janus figures referred to above represent both male and female beings. 26.The present authors wish to emphasize that they agree with the interpretations of Horst Cain (1979:510-512) according to which the main fig ures of the Polynesian pantheon are actually dei fied ancestors. 27. Barrow 1961; also, Fedorovna (1993:128,140) cites Barrow's references to double-headed Maori tiki as personifications of the god Tangaroa. 28. Fedorovna 1993:140.

In addition, the statue itself wears a crown of coral branches. 29. Large roughly dressed slabs of white volcanic tufa (keke'oho), or white beach rock, were sometimes employed in the walls of ceremonial platforms (Suggs 1961:162). Smaller slabs of these materials were also used to form the top courses of stone ceremonial platforms. 30.Steinen 192.8 (iii) : Alpha W. The description of the shrine is based on a drawing and description done by a Marquesan informant and then redrawn by von den Steinen himself. 31. In addition to coconut leaves, the plants includ ed hibiscus wood and papa moho, a fern of the Polypodium species. It is not clear which plants were set in the coral base. 32.Steinen I928(iii): Delta H.14.
