<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes for a Discussion PETER JOZSA The uses of the word "play" may be grouped in two major classes. The first covers every material process in which the behavior of individual elements is supposed to be either incalculable/inexplicable in principle or at least without importance for understanding the process itself which is of a "higher" order. Such is the play of individual electron movement in a beam. It is also the play of events which constitute the movement of supply, demand, and price on the market or the play of differential relations which define the constitutive rules for a given corpus of signifiers. The second class of play includes all uses of the word which refer to activities of living beings (animals, children, adults, groups, cultures, etc.). It would be easy to show that the first class is only an anthropomorphic (or "biomorphic") projection, an "animistic projection" following the expression of Jacques Monod (i.e., metaphorical extension of the second meaning to processes which are supposed to be, are understandable as, inanimate). But this is not the place to analyze this excellent example of metaphor's role [investis- sement] in our scientific thinking whose results, as we have suspected for a long time, are not purely scientific. Derrida has begun to analyze this, and recently, Claudine Normand has tried to demonstrate it.' The informal remarks which follow treat exclusively the second class of play. The question which I wish to raise may be stated as follows: what purpose will it serve the social sciences to introduce "play" as an operative concept, or more precisely, how can one shape these "unexplained zones" of human behavior where the introduction of this concept might serve as an explicative principle? The proposals which I offer will obviously require carefully founded and elaborated arguments. I am putting them to paper only provisionally in the context of this written colloquium. Really, I am thinking of two groups of problems. One concerns the way we interpret the signifying practice in the most general sense of the term [pratique signifiante], particularly this aspect of what Kristeva has called the symbolic,2 placed in relation with the concept of the thetic act. The other group of Sub-Stance No 25, 1980 25</page><page sequence="2">26 Peter J6zsa problems is related to that particular production of meaning which, in our culture, has become (has been contemplated as and/or made to function as) an autonomous reality: "aesthetic" practice. 1. The applicability of the concept of play in the interpretation of the signifying practice After the difficulties experienced by French semiology in seeking a way out of an epistemological trap laid by the construction of cultural theories based on a Saussurian-Jakobsonian-Hjelmslevian model, Kristeva in La Revolution du langage podtique, seems to have found a possible solution by introducing a distinction between the semiotic and the symbolic. The novelty of her thinking lies primarily in an inversion of the dichotomy between semiotic and semantic advocated by Benveniste.3 While for Benveniste the first term marks the space of the arbitrary and the second, the locus of the production of meaning [sig-nifiance], Kristeva, using the concept of drive [pulsion], succeeds in subordinating even the semiotic to functionality. By positing the symbolic as the other member of the dichotomy (and as the site of the thetic) she is able to introduce attribution to semiotic thinking as a simultaneously organic and autonomous principle. Attribution (of any signifier to a signified posited by that very act) is the universal capacity of living beings capable of signifying practices. Now if it is true that this leads to the elaboration of methodological devices which make it possible to approach texts as products of an individual, his times and his environment, and no longer as pure syntactic textures (as professed by Levi-Strauss in the late '60s), it nonetheless remains true that not everything is yet explicable. Unforeseen lacunae occur, one of which seems to me particularly important. As complete as psychological and/or culturological determination of the "semiotic" may be, it is unconscious by definition. On the other hand, it is realized only in and through the "thetic" (attribution) which is a conscious act (if not in the sense of being premeditated, at least in the sense of being lived). Since Kristeva's book, the relationship between "motivated" and "unmoti- vated" action may be viewed differently. Leaving aside the fundamental linguistic problem and considering only cultural texts (what the Russians call "secondary modeling systems"), we find that these latter texts can no longer be analyzed as "unmotivated," or more precisely, that their level of non- motivation: a) is rigorously shaped as the level where one of their properties- syntactic organization- can be grasped; b) is displaced because it is no longer the level of a perhaps non-existant subject controlled by rules of discourse. On the contrary, it is the level of activity of the subject which becomes the site of mediation between its own determinations (signified) and the rules of discourse (signifiers) provided by society. The thetic (attribution) rendered explicit by Kristeva is precisely this mediation. Hence between two determined universes: signifieds and signifiers, the subject is the very occurrence which posits them as such. It is the assigner [attributeur].</page><page sequence="3">Notes for a Discussion 27 Since, for the assigner, signified and signifier are equally unconscious, the act of attribution can be perceived only as his arbitrary act. This subjectively- lived attribution cannot be set off in parentheses as a secondary concern, as redundant from the point of view of the intelligibility of the semiotic process. It is one of the conditions of the very functioning of the machine. In order for meaning to be produced, a) signifiers must be constructed according to rules which may be described without recourse to any sort of subjectivity; b) the process of production must unleash signifieds constrained by factors which may receive a purely objective interpretation; c) but in one and the same movement a subjectivity must be present to "decide," to "enunciate" [Vnonce] what meaning there is,just as the child enunciates that "this chair is a train"; d) the decisions of the assigning subject [sujet attributeur] must immediately have- or one could say be their very nature- social values and functions. The thetic in action is a form of play, it is Play. It is the occurrence of freedom, of the incalculable, of opacity; it is responsible for events in man's history and for the fact that they are intelligible only after the fact. Without play, the universe would be transparent, timeless, already "played" out, reversible and probable in Wiener's sense.4 If the act of attribution, the occurrence of play, is the site of indeterminacy, how can it become an object of science? Or, simply, how can one talk about it? I believe that each individual act will always by its nature (and by definition) remain unforeseeable. On the other hand, we should think about a historical and/or socio-cultural typology of "possible" acts in the enlarged and modified sense of Lucien Goldmann's "possible consciousness." This would be a "sociosemiology of knowledge" which would have as its task the description and understanding of the socio-historical types of man's "attributive activity" (we will not discuss here the psychological implications of such a venture). Finally, this would be a central chapter in a general science of social communication yet to come. 2. Applicability of the concept of play in "aesthetics" It is curious to remark that literature dealing with play, in the great majority of cases, treats it only in two rigidly separate fashions: 1. either one speaks of an organic component of individual behavior, these individuals always being animals or children;5 2. or else it is treated as an integral part of adult social life, but in this case not at all in its function as an organic element of "daily" or "normal" behavior; here play becomes a component factor of isolated social situations.6 In both cases, play is conceived of as something "not serious," although in two distinctive ways. In the first case, play characterizes the behavior of individuals who are not yet serious beings, not yet adults. In the second case it</page><page sequence="4">28 Peter J6zsa represents something which is no longer serious: it forms redundancy in social life. With the exception of Winnicott's work7 where the problem of play is part of an analytical approach, I have found only one formulation which considers play a normal and necessary component of the human adult in his daily activity. In this formulation, Hebb, after declaring that play is "work performed purely out of love for the activity itself," states: ... the need for mental gymnastics exists in its own right. Boredom is a state in which the living organism is seeking a higher level of stimulation, and he usually finds it in a form of play: the suppression of boredom is one of the most important components of human behavior.8 Nonetheless, if one tries to elaborate the notion of this component based on Hebb's formulation (and not only in psychology but as an operative concept in culturological theory building), it is clear that the conclusion of both inter- pretive tendencies characterized above will be indispensable. A closer look reveals that in two cases which situate play on opposite sides of the serious, two different things are involved. In the first case, for which play is on the "near side" of the serious, it consists in imitation, in the replacement of the self as actor by another external actor. In the second case, where play is on the "far side" of the serious, it consists in a diversion, in a modification of the outcome, i.e., in a replacement of a normally expected outcome by another, thus giving a variant which is incalculable from the conditions which rendered necessary the action in itself. This is not the place to go into details concerning the factors of human behavior which make possible both types of replacement. The role of identifica- tion with the Other, of the play of the self replacing itself by the Other in establishing the identity of the human and social person, is profoundly analyzed by Mead, even though the study is limited to the process of develop- ment and does not consider play as a constant component of adult social life. On the other hand, every general and cultural anthropology textbook and every textbook of the history of technology makes it clear that possible solutions for no matter what task are multiple. If, following Hebb, play must be taken seriously, as a principle inherent to human behavior, it will be in the following two ways: as tending toward (or necessitated by) the gratuitous substitution of Self by an Other, and as tending toward (or necessitated by) making possible solutions of given tasks vary gratuitously. For the moment it would be too daring to speculate about the perspectives in sociology and cultural anthropology which this sort of thinking may eventually open. I will limit myself to certain problems in aesthetics. Hartmann9 sees the notion of "pure creation," of "creation from nothing," only in music. He defines music as "the free play of form." His argument is based on the mimetic character of the other arts which makes freedom inaccessible to them. However, it is clear that if non-musical aesthetics were defined by "mimetics" it simply could not exist.10 I prefer to take Lukfics' theory of "Weltmaissigkeit" as a point of departure.</page><page sequence="5">Notes for a Discussion 29 According to this theory, an aesthetic work has its coherent universe--is a universe--in which each element, as aleatory as it may be, is furnished with meanings depending on, and in relation with, this totality which is the universe of the work. Hence, this universe is an order of things, but an order of a singular nature. On one hand, it is an imagined or posited order constructed by a subject who, in order to do that- even if it is only to project himself or precisely if it is to project himself- must imagine himself as something other than himself, must replace himself by this order which, as a projection of Self, literally replaces him. It is a commonplace of criticism to speak of an author as a "self" of his own creation. On the other hand, one of the great mysteries of aesthetics, which must properly become one of the central themes of a scientific discourse, is that this order is impossible if its component elements are not aleatory in character (of course not in an absolute sense, but at levels which can be defined by descrip- tion). Play is doubly involved here. First, an aesthetic effect is in one sense nothing more than the beholder's [ricepteur] experience of an organic necessity in the way all elements of a situation become present. Traditionally, this has transformed criticism into a hermeneutics which believes that it can and must explain everything. Second, the author or artist is almost incapable of giving a detailed account of what he has done. He has played by replacing, step by step, one possible solution by another equally possible one. "Weltmaissigkeit" is then the product of these two types of replacement- play: replacement of Self by the Other and replacement of One by Another. One may say that this is just another theory of aesthetics. Perhaps, but it is focused on a precise problem. It is a singularity of our culture to have constructed aesthetics in an autonomous zone. It is by this singularity that the sovereignty of the aesthetic producer has become possible, sovereignty (in both cultural and psychological senses) which grounds this double replacement-play. We have seen that the replacement of Self and the replacement of Solution are equally inherent to all human behavior and activity. Now aesthetics is this privileged space which is nothing more than the pure functioning of these two types of replacement. It follows that western culture, because it renders aesthetics autonomous, comes to be marked by cancellation. To this autonomy there corresponds another: the useful, the practical, the serious, or according to another ideological order, the pertinent, the moral, and once again the serious. The introduction of the category of PLAY to our thinking makes it possible to analyze the schizophrenia of a civilization built on the productive/unproduc- tive dichotomy (and on all the endless morbid moralism which comes from it).

It is interesting to remark that, even though he knew nothing about information theory and its relation to life forms, even though he knew nothing of the problematics of semantics, Huizinga had a vague presentiment of this view of play: "From the point of view of a world wholly deter- mined by the operation of blind forces play would be altogether superfluous. Play only becomes possible, thinkable and understandable when an influx of mind breaks down the absolute determinism of the cosmos."
