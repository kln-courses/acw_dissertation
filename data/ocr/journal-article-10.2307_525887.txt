<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Forum of Roman London: Excavations of 1968-9 By B. J. PHILP Summary AN initial, superficial occupation (Period I, c. A.D. 43) of the site prob- ably reflects a Roman military base of the Conquest period. The first formal layout (Period II, c. 44-50) included a main east-west street, north of which lay a metalled area and two wooden structures separated by a north-south road, again almost certainly part of a military base. A large scale Claudian redevelopment (Period III, c. 5o-6o) relaid both the east-west road and the metalled area. In the angle formed by these lay at least three large timber-framed buildings, on an east-west axis and probably consisting of ranges of rooms, at least one frontal verandah and two semi-basements; two of these buildings were divided from the third by a minor east-west road. The framed walls were infilled with wattle, daub or brick, over wooden sleeper-plates sup- ported on trenched piles. The floors were of clay, some roofs tiled and many walls painted, one four times. Water was piped along the principal road. The layout, still reminiscent of military work, probably reflects the initiation of the civilian town east of the Walbrook which set the permanent street-pattern for the eastern half of the city. All the buildings on the site were destroyed by the Boudiccan fire of A.D. 60. Piecemeal rebuilding (Period IV, c. 60-90) through the fire-debris moved the remetalled main east-west road marginally northwards and swung the axis about 30 eastwards. This work included the construction of the south and east ranges of a massive masonry building, with flanking ranges of rooms which must have dominated the centre of London. Covering about 360 ft. by 200 ft., an area of about i- acres, it was clearly a major public building, almost certainly used for administrative purposes; it is here described as the 'proto-forum'. Dumps of soil and rubbish immediately to the east were soon covered by a corner bakehouse containing ovens of more than one phase and by a road 12 ft. wide flanking the east side of the proto-forum. The whole site was next redeveloped (Period V, c. 9o-Ioo) for the grand forum-basilica complex, the largest in Britain. Designed and phased around the proto-forum, it respected the east-west road but swung the axis back to I</page><page sequence="2">2 B.J.

The work resulted in total demolition across the site, the deposition of huge dumps of soil and the construction of parts of the south and east ranges of the forum. The total scheme covered 560 by 550 ft., embrac- ing 71 acres. The centre of the south range, facing the basilica and flanking the principle road, incorporated at least 19 large piers representing a monumental entrance c. 125 ft. in width. The rear half of this projected into the piazza and had two periods of construction, the later not earlier than the reign of Hadrian. INTRODUCTION1 An extensive site in the angle formed by the junction of Gracechurch Street with Fenchurch Street, E.C.I, was designated by the staff of the Guildhall Museum as of considerable archaeological potential, being to a large extent unexplored (FIG. I). It was reasonably presumed that the site might encompass a large part of the south range of the Roman Forum, sections of a substantial masonry building of pre-forum date and perhaps a section of a major east-west road through the Roman city. When plans to redevelop the site emerged, pro- tracted efforts were made to obtain permission to carry out archaeological investigation. Mainly due to the efforts of Mr R. Merrifield, then Deputy Director of the Guildhall Museum, a clause was eventually inserted in the contract by the developers, City of London Real Property Co. Ltd., allowing 'archaeological investigation for a period of four weeks, providing this does not hold up work'. The contract was due to start in November 1968, when the very slender labour resources of the Guildhall Museum were fully employed on the re- excavation of the Roman bath-building at Billingsgate;2 it was clearly neces- sary to seek substantial outside help, and the previous efforts of the West Kent Archaeological Group with the Huggin Hill bath-house in 19643 and the Roman Palace site near Cannon Street in 1965 provided precedent for an invitation. Accordingly, in September 1968 the writer accepted a formal request from Norman Cook, then Director of Guildhall Museum, to direct the excavation. Work was undertaken despite the condition imposed by the Corporation of the City of London that a formal contract be signed indemnifying the Corpora- tion against all accidents, injury, loss, damage or legal actions howsoever caused. Demolition of the existing buildings on the site (168-70 Fenchurch St.) proceeded during October and the archaeological excavation began with some difficulty on 28 October, three days before the demolition was completed. Although four weeks had been agreed for the archaeological work, this 1 Abbreviations used in the text: finds are referred to by their appended specialist-report numbers as Coins (Coin Nos.), samian (Sam.

PHILP agreement was clearly qualified by the last part of the contractural clause and the main developers (Harry Neal Ltd.) moved on to the site on 4 November to start work on a tower-block for Barclays Bank Ltd. The contractor's almost instant demand that we should withdraw after only eight days of excavation was graciously declined and full-scale archaeological excavation continued, with some difficulty, for four weeks. Subsequent similar invitations were also declined, and selected excavation and recording continued in the contractor's areas for another four months until everything was substantially completed in March 1969. By that date all the finds had been cleaned, coded, boxed and delivered to the Guildhall Museum, and by the end of 1969 the text and draw- ings of this report were virtually ready for the press. Hopes of early publication were frustrated by delays over obtaining a samian report; eventually at the end of 1975 Mr G. Dannell agreed to take over the material, and gratitude is due to him for his prompt and detailed study (p. 45). The final text and drawings of this report were completed by i April 1976. The total cost of the excavation, of processing the finds and of the preparation for publication was just ?I,510. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks are due first and foremost to the large contingent of volunteers who worked under pressure on this deep and dangerous site, virtually non-stop and often in appal- ling weather. Despite the conditions they were able to produce work of a high stan- dard and to maintain good humour throughout. The hard-core of the team comprised members of the CIB teams drawn from the Reculver and West Kent Groups, of whom special mention must be made of Misses P. George, A. McGarry, E. Mynott and Messrs. H. Davies, R. Fendt, R. Garnett, M. Kellaway and A. Norris. Mr J. A. Willson acted as deputy director for much of the period, and Messrs G. B. Clewley, A. Gidlow and A. J. Rook as supervisors at various times. Of a total of 62 volunteers who worked either on the site or in the office, special mention must also be made of Miss M. Har- man, Messrs P. Clare, M. Heasman, T. Ithell, R. Mills, A. Scott and J. Williams. The help and interest of Mr Richard Barclay, of Barclay's Bank Ltd., is gratefully acknowledged, as too is the help of Mr A. Fleming, site architect, and Mr A. Jacobi, representing the contractors. The sympathetic understanding of Mr J.Bergin, foreman of Willment Bros. Ltd., helped ease a difficult task and warm thanks are extended to him. The staff of the Guildhall Museum provided good moral support and in this respect particular thanks are due to Mrs I. Shaw. Grateful thanks are also due to various people for their help with this report. First, Professor S. S. Frere and Mr Norman Cook have both read the text in draft and made helpful suggestions. Mr J. A. Willson and Mr T. Woodman have skilfully prepared most of the plans and sections. Mr G. B. Clewley and Mr A. Beningfield have kindly drawn the pottery, the report and descriptions of which have been provided by Mr P. Couldrey. Mr R. Merrifield has identified the coins, Dr D. B. Harden has examined some of the glass, Mr G. Dannell has reported on the samian and the Jodrell Labora- tory at Kew on the wood samples. Mrs W. Williams, Miss A. Button and Miss P. George are gratefully thanked for their assistance with several aspects of the final preparation of the Report. The text was originally and subsequently typed by Miss E.</page><page sequence="5">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 5 Mynott (now Mrs Philp) and the photographs were taken by the writer. The project was financed jointly by the Corporation of London, the (then) Ministry of Public Buildings and Works and the Society of Antiquaries of London. AIMS AND METHODS As the area to be investigated was large (more than 25,000 sq. ft.) and the resources and time severely limited, special tactics were required. These in- cluded rapid excavation, greatly assisted by mechanical means, and the employ- ment of a large, well-trained and disciplined labour-force. A bulldozer (Cat D6) and a large crane (RB22), the latter fitted with a one-ton steel ball, were im- mediately employed to remove the remaining superficial obstructions. Next a high-powered hydraulic 'Poclain' excavator was hired and this soon broke out the buried modern concrete foundation and walls. It then excavated, under close control, deep trenches at selected points, which established the depth of natural soil, revealed the extent of stratified deposits and provided a basis on which to plan further work. The mechanical work was supervised, supplemented and extended by a care- fully selected force of trained volunteer and vocational archaeologists drawn mainly from the various Kent groups constituting the Council for Kentish Archaeology. Previous work on many Kent sites, with both mechanical exca- vators and the volunteer-corps, had already tested and proved the system. Members of associated groups in Hertfordshire and Essex also joined the team. In spite of the demolition programme running late, entry was made on the agreed date and the demolition contractors were obliged to confine their activi- ties to the east part of the site. Large-scale archaeological excavation, by machine and by hand, then began in the south-west quarter of the site where the main structures were thought to be. The original plan was to expand right across the whole area, but the unscheduled arrival on the ninth day of a stream of contractors' plant and lorries made this impossible. As a compromise, work in the south-west area was expanded, with the result that the bulk of the infor- mation and all the long sections derive from there. The second phase of the programme concerned instant recording in all the contractors' under-pinning holes, foundation- and sheet-piling trenches across the remainder of the site. The main problems here were constant danger from massive machinery on a very crowded site and the fact that many trenches were dug and filled within a few hours. The situation was additionally complicated by the fact that the main contractor was under a penalty of ?8,ooo per week for delay and because at least four more teams of sub-contractors and their heavy plant were constantly moving about the site. Added hazards were a series of pile-holes 4 ft. in diameter, each 150 ft. deep, excavated at short intervals across the site, and piling rigs which caused extensive vibration and temporary deafness. Even so, it was possible to open up one or two extra</page><page sequence="6">6 B. J. PHILP trenches amid the chaos, notably working through Christmas week, 1968, when most of the workmen were at home. Finally, a disused shop was taken over as a field headquarters and its essential services re-connected. This also provided a store for tools, finds and other equipment, and a springboard for all subsequent operations. THE EXCAVATIONS The demolition contractors had largely cleared the site to cellar floor level (45 ft. O.D.) which was itself some I ft. below the adjacent street-level (56 ft. O.D.). The excavation revealed the surface of undisturbed natural brick- earth at about I9 ft. below street-level (37 ft. O.D.), thus leaving an average depth of about 8 ft. of stratified deposits for investigation. Apart from intrusive features, these proved to be almost exclusively early Roman, dating mostly to the second half of the first century. All deposits above 45 ft. O.D. had been des- troyed when the cellars were dug in the 19th century, and even beneath the cellar floors there were numerous concrete and brick foundations of similar date.

This report deals only with the early Roman periods; the later features are simply listed at the end with their appropriate museum excavation-register (E.R.) number to facilitate further study. PERIOD I (c. A.D. 43) Over most of the eastern halfof the site and also along part of its southern side, the undisturbed orange-brown brickearth and grey clay natural deposits were capped by very thin bands of grey-black loam and carbon (FIG. 23: S.2, L.26-27, and S.3, L.28).5 These deposits are occupational debris representing the primary occupation on the site. No related structures were located in the areas available and the few associated finds included an As of Claudius (Coin No. I) and a small amount of coarse pottery (CP. Nos. 1-2). All of the material recovered from these primary deposits is of mid first-century date and thus in accord with the long-established view that permanent settlement began in London in 43, at the time of the Roman conquest. The probability is that this primary occupation was of a purely military character, perhaps reflecting either a temporary camp on this site or activity by troops living nearby. PERIOD II (c. 44-50) The superficial primary deposits (Period I) were generally sealed over most of the site by well-defined layers of gravel, dumped clay and occupational debris relating to structures and roads. As these were in turn all sealed by the massive buildings and corresponding roads of Period III they are here regarded as a distinct second period of occupation (Period II). The probability is, to judge by the slight nature of the primary deposits, that the Period II roads and buildings were laid out within months of the troops arriving on the site (say A.D. 43-44). Certainly Period II must end several years before 6o to allow for the Period III buildings to be constructed, renovated, occupied and then destroyed by the Boudiccan fire of that date. On this evidence, therefore, it seems likely that the Period II occupation ended no later than c. 50o nor do the finds from the related deposits contradict this dating. These include another coin of Claudius (Coin No. 2), five samian vessels (Sam. Nos. 1-5) and coarse pottery (CP Nos. 4-8). Period II thus provides the first evidence of regular layout of this part of the Roman settlement. The first feature was the extreme north edge of an east-west road (F.0) running along the south limit of the site, which took the form of a band of gravel several inches thick. It was bordered on its northern side by a small vertical-sided ditch (F.2) about 2 ft. 6 in. wide and about I ft. 6 in. deep (0o76 by 0o46 m) (FIG. 4: S.Io, L.17) which was traced for 6o ft. (18.30 m). Its filling of loam and pebble, mostly representing silt and the eroded surface of ' For explanation of these symbols see p. 3, note I.</page><page sequence="8">8 B. J. PHILP the road, contained a small bead-rim cooking pot of mid first-century date (CP No. 4): This early road was remetalled more than seven times in subsequent years (FIG. 2: S.4; cf. S.9, S.Io) and it is clear that it remained a major route throughout most, if not all, of the Roman period (PL. I A). In addition a large area of gravel (F.3 and F.4) about 3-5 in. (7.5-i2.5 cm) thick and covering an area of about 6o by 30 ft., was traced on the western part of the site (FIG. 23: S.2, L.24 and Block Sections 5 and 6 (FIG. 3)). This seems to have remained an open area in both Periods II and III (FIG. 5), perhaps serv- ing as a courtyard on the north side of the east-west road.

Block sections 5 to 9, Roman Forum site, London (1:48). For linear scale and conventions see FIG. 23. Eastwards towards the centre of the site there was evidence of a wooden building (FIG. 22, F.5) with a clay floor (FIG. 23: S.I, L.34 and 70). The lines of the west and south walls were marked by six circular post-holes 4-5 in (Io- 12.5 cm) in diameter, tapered and up to 2 ft. (6o cm) deep. The pair in the south wall (shown on Section i (FIG. 23)) were set in a deliberately dug foundation- trench, rectangular in section, 2 ft. 3 in. wide and I ft. 6 in. deep (o.69 by 0o46 m). The posts had been driven into the bottom of this trench and then packed round with clay for stability. Exactly this technique was used for many of the Period III walls where the posts, also set in pairs, generally formed piles to support substantial wooden plates upon which the actual walls were built. Only the bottom ends of the west line of posts survived, but these suggest that the build- ing was at least 21 ft. (6-40 m) in north-south length. The width was clearly greater than 4 ft. (I-22 m) but probably not more than about 25 ft.,(7.60 m), as the building appears to have been flanked by more metalling on its east side.</page><page sequence="9">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 9 This new metalling (F.6) was traced for a north-south length of 30 ft.

From this somewhat piecemeal evidence it seems that during Period II the roads and buildings were laid out on a rec- tangular plan. The broad outline seems to have been alternating metalled areas and structures running parallel to each other along the north side of a major east-west road. A military layout seems highly probable. PERIOD III (C. 50-60) (FIG. 5) The Period II structures (F.5 and F.7) and the associated north-south street (F.6) were superseded during a major replanning (Period III) of the area. New wooden buildings, rectilinear in form and massive in size, were traced across the entire eastern part of the site. The Period II axis appear to have been retained and the main east-west road continued in use, being remetalled at least twice; (FIG. 4: S.IO, L.I4 and 16, and Block Section 9 (FIG. 3)). These new buildings were completely consumed by the fire of 6o, which swept across Roman London," and for which there was ample evidence over much of the site (see below). Clearly their erection must fall some time before 6o. Signifi- cantly, the internal wall of one building (F. I6) of this period had been surfaced at four different times with layers of painted plaster and this clearly implies a span of several years. It seems certain, therefore, that the beginning of Period * D. R. Dudley and G. Webster, The Rebellion of Boudicca (1962), p. Ioo.</page><page sequence="10">IO B. J.

If allowance be made for a reasonable duration of Period II, a date of c. 50 most conveniently fits the various possibilities with- out conflicting with the associated finds. In particular the make-up for the floors of some of the buildings contained a small amount of pottery (Sam. Nos. 6-7 and CP Nos. 9-14). Another small group of objects was found sealed by the actual fire-debris (Coin No. 3 of Claudius; Sam. Nos. 8-9; CP Nos. 15-18 and SF Nos. 5-6). From the evidence it seems likely that at least three buildings were constructed on the eastern part of the site, perhaps separated by a minor east-west street. On the western side, however, no trace of Period III structures was found and (as in Period II) this area appears to have remained open (F.3 and F.4). Evidence for its remetalling with a layer of gravel 3-12 in. thick, was found at several points (FIG. 23: S.2, L.2I and Block Sections 5 and 6 (FIG. 3)). Unfortunately much of the area of the Period III buildings had been des- troyed by later foundations, nor was it possible to examine large areas in detail owning to contractor's operations. Four main east-west alignments were, how- ever, detected across most of the eastern part of the site. One alignment (F.io) found in three places over a minimum distance of 8o ft. (24-40 m) was about 4 ft. (1-20 m) north of the small road-ditch (F.2) and must represent the front- age-line of the building flanking the main east-west road. A second alignment (F.I I) recorded in two places over a minimum distance of 48 ft. (14-60 m) was parallel to the first and about 14 ft. (4-27 m) from it. Both walls probably formed part of the same building and a wide range of rooms may be indicated. Part of a third alignment (F.I2) was found about 32 ft. (9-75 m) further north at only one point, and this took the form of a double wall (FIG. 5). The fourth alignment (F.13), again detected at only one point, was found 44 ft. (13-41 m) further to the north (all measurements being taken to and from centre-lines). Two main north-south alignments were also found. That on the east side (F. I4) was detected in the contractor's excavations at three separate points over a distance of 103 ft. (31.39 m) spanning a metalled area (F.I8) which perhaps represents a minor east-west street. That on the west side (F.15a) was seen only in one place (FIG. 23: S.3, cut into L.22). In two places, both on the east side of the longer alignment, all pre-existing deposits and even some subsoil had been removed to a depth of about I ft. 6 in. (0-46 m) to create a sunken floor, or semi-basement (F.I6 and F.17). Two areas of metalling (F.I8), each consisting of 4-5 in. (10-12-5 cm) of laid gravel and each covering an area of about io sq. ft. (o093 m2), were found in the north-east part of the site (FIG. 3: Block Section 7). Both were covered by deep deposits of fire-debris and they strongly suggest a Period III east-west minor street, traced for at least 25 ft. (7.60 m). In the west part of the area observed, the gravel tapered to a point defining a clear south edge to the road. As regards the overall plan of Period III (FIG. 5) it is clear that the main east- west street, on the southern limit of the site, remained in constant use. North of</page><page sequence="12">12 B. J. PHILP this it seems that at least three building-areas were represented, two of them separated from the third by the minor east-west street of uncertain width. The space between the two streets is about 98 ft. (29-87 m) and significantly the double wall (F.12) falls almost exactly half way between the two. Possibly this represents the external walls of two separate buildings (shown as 'centre' and 'south' on FIG. 5). Of the extent of the centre one it is difficult to say much owing to the removal of a great part of its presumed area by the 19th-century double basement at the centre of the site. The remains suggest an overall width of about 44 ft. (13-40 m) (between F.I2 and F.13) and a minimum east-west length of 22 ft. (6-70 m) (between F.13 and the projected line of F.I4), with doubtless other internal divisions. Fortunately the situation is rather better for the south building. The two parallel southern walls (F.Io and F.II) certainly represent a range at least 82 ft. (25 m) in length, on an east-west axis fronting the main road. The space of 32 ft. (9"75 m) between this range and the double wall (F.12) seems just too large for a single span, and a dividing wall (or walls) is necessary. No trace of this was found in the contractor's trenches across most of the area, but signifi- cantly the centre-point of this wide span falls exactly in the position occupied by the massive sleeper-wall of the later forum. Although no evidence was recovered to set any eastern limit to these structures, the west end was to some extent defined. The overall western limit is suggested by a single wall (F. 5a) seen in Section 3 (FIG. 23), which if projected south would meet the outer east- west wall (F.io) to form the outer corner of the structure. The character of this west wall is superficial when compared with most of the other walls and it seems likely that it was not a load-carrying wall, but perhaps a support for a pentice roof or an open verandah. The same is also true of the extreme west end of the south frontage wall (F.Io) which was substantially less than the foundations further east. A second, again rather superficial, west wall (F.I5b) was recorded just north of two post-Roman wells (F.74 and F.75). This was set some 5 ft. (1-5 m) inside the projected line of the outer west wall (F.I 5a), but its southward pro- jection meets the second major east-west wall neatly at its termination on the great ragstone base (F.19; see below). Th various projections of these various walls produce a tentative plan of a building at least 88 ft. (26.8o m) in east- west length and 46 ft. (14 m) in total north-south width. The single north-south wall (F.I4) suggests at least one internal division. Of the north building beyond the minor east-west street (F.I8) there is little that can be added. Certainly the intensive fire-debris covered nearly all of the area flanking Ship Tavern Passage as far as the East Road. This suggests the presence of another very large building across the area, but of this only the presumed internal wall (F.I4) and the semi-basement (F. 17) were located under the extreme circumstances imposed by the contractor's excavations. The west side of a circular pit (F.78) about 4 ft. (1.22 m) deep and about 5 ft. 4 in. (I-63 m) in diameter, with vertical sides and flat base, was cut by a later</page><page sequence="13">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 13 tank (F.68). It lay some 20 ft. west of the north-south wall (F.14) and was filled with debris from the Boudiccan fire. It may represent a storage pit within the northern building.

In the latter the wooden plates were laid on short piles set in a rectangular trench. The trenches, much like those of Period II (p. 8), were normally about 2 ft. (o.6I m) wide and I ft. 6 in. (0-46 m) deep. The piles, mostly laid in pairs, were sharpened posts 2 or 3 ft. (0-91 m) long and between 3 and Io in. (7-6-25-4 cm) in diameter.

There three sets of piles were located, the pairs being 3 in. (o-o8 m) and 4 ft. 3 in. (I.30 m) apart respectively. None of the actual piles had survived, but the soft fill of the sockets was readily visible. It seems probable that the wooden plates either formed part of or supported the massive timber uprights which no doubt formed part of the main frame of the buildings. The more elaborate piled foundations were prob- ably the main load-bearing walls, and it may be that the buildings were in places of two storeys.

In the south-east corner of the site, at the junction of two walls (F.I I and F.I4) the fire-debris contained a mass of fragmented tile that must certainly have come from an adjacent roof. Both tegulae and imbrices were included. Fragments of carbon- ised wood were found at various points on the clay floors and particularly in the bottom of the semi-basement room (F.I 6) where large fragments were iden- tified as oak (p. 62, Samples 1-3). There an almost horizontal layer of burnt wood had been sealed by the fallen walls and may represent parts of the roof- timbers or internal partitions. No trace of window-glass was found in any of the debris. Many of the walls had clearly been rendered with thin coats of plaster of which small traces were found in the fire-debris. There was often a layer ? inch (I3 mm) thick of white plaster painted white, or very occasionally red or green. The plaster actually remained in situ in both the semi-basement rooms, on the east face of the northern one (F.I7: PL. II A) and on the north face of the southern one (F.I6; FIG. 6). In the latter no fewer than four separate coats of thin plaster had been applied to the clay wall, each about 1 inch thick and each painted a shade of white. Near the south-west corner of the Period III complex, actually at the pro- jected junction of two walls (F.II and F.i5b) a large rectangular block of squared Kentish ragestone8 (F. 19) was exposed in situ (FIG. 8) by the contractors (PL. II B). It measured 2 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. I in. and was I ft. 3 in. high (o069 by 0-63 by 0-38 m); it stood on a massive base of ragstone set in yellow-white mortar which was itself 5 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep (1.52 by o091 m) and cut into the earlier deposits (FIG. 8, L.5 and 6). A thin band of pebbles separated the block from its base and a wedge-shaped mass of yellow clay had been built against its west face (FIG. 8, L.4). This massive base and the ragstone block above suggest a pedestal for a free-standing pier or column. If it was built as an integral part of the Period III buildings then it must have formed the cornerstone on which much of the main building hinged. It had certainly been exposed at the time of the fire, for it was scorched and the adjacent surfaces (FIG. 8, L.3) baked by the heat and all totally covered by the burnt debris (FIG. 8, L.2). A small fragment of an iron water-pipe collar (F.i9a; SF No. I) was found close to the Period III frontage-line (F.II) at the very edge of the main east- west road. This was on the line of a narrow soil-filled slot or gully (F.19b) detected both to the east and to the west (FIG. 4: S. Io, cutting L.12). There can be little doubt that both the gully and the collar relate to a wooden water-main laid east-west across the site. The section showed clearly that it post-dated the Period II road and that it was sealed by the Period III fire-debris. As stated, the timber-framed buildings of Period III had been totally con- 8 Identified by Mr F. G.

There can be no doubt that this fire debris related to the Boudiccan raid of 60, a conclusion firmly established by the related stratigraphy and the associated finds from every part of the site. Similar fire-debris has been found over an area of more than twenty acres, mostly on the east side of the River Walbrook,9 to which the present site adds a notable eastwards extension.

That the town rose phoenix-like from the ashes is clear, but inevitably this was a slow process, as at Verulamium.10 With more than 20 acres (8 ha) of destroyed buildings to replace the process was necessarily selective and piecemeal. Over the western part of this site, on what had been an extensive metalled area in Periods II and III, a vast new masonry building was erected which was to dominate the centre of the town for the next thirty years. The precise function of this building is still in doubt (see p. 36), but for convenience it is hereafter described as the proto-forum. Immediately east of this building deep deposits of soil and domestic rubbish were dumped across the area. Later a bakehouse with a bank of bread-ovens was built over the dumped rubbish. At about the same time a new north-south minor street was laid along the east side of the proto-forum. These structures and deposits are described in detail below. Both the proto-forum and the bakehouse were demolished and then sealed by the huge spreads of soil deposited when the great forum was started in about 90 (Period V). I. The proto-forum (FIG. 22: F.20o-F.38. See also FIG. 9). Earlier excavations on both sides of Gracechurch Street had revealed substan- tial lengths of masonry of first-century date. Just prior to the start of the present excavations it had been suggested that these walls might form part of a single grand 'public building' and that the south-east corner might be found on the site. This proved to be the case. The external east wall (F.20) was traced for 116 ft. (35-36 m) across the site and partly under Ship Tavern Passage. The external south wall (F.2I) was traced for 64 ft. (19-51 m) (PL. III A), and a number of internal walls, of at least two phases, were located. Phase I Both external walls had foundations of mortared flint rubble, 5 ft. (1.52 m) deep and 3 ft. 4 in. (0-93 m) wide (FIG. 23: S.2 and 3). The wall above the foundation was 3 ft. (o-91 m) wide and consisted of a triple course of red tiles surmounted by at least two courses of ragstone ashlar, set in yellow-white mortar. Three original buttresses (F.22-24) were located along the east wall, the complete ones being 3 ft. (0-91 m) long and 2 ft. 6 in. (0o76 m) wide. It seems clear that others must have existed. If one is restored half-way between the nothern pair (F.23 and F.24), intervals of about 14 ft. (4.27 m) may be suggested. Using the same interval exactly three more can be fitted between the central and southern surviving buttresses (F.22 and F.23). Apart from the corner buttress which returned along the south side for about 6 ft. (1.8o m) (PL. IV B), no other was detected along this side, though one other may have been masked by the later forum pier-bases. In the east range another identical north-south wall (F.25) was traced for 10 S. S. Frere, Verulamium Excavations i (1972), 23.</page><page sequence="18">18 B. J. PHILP 76 ft. (23-16 m) parallel to the outer east wall (F.20). The space between these two walls was about 14 ft. (4-27 m) which, discounting cross-walls later added, suggests a long ambulatory or portico (PL. III B). In the south range two further east-west walls (F.26 and F.27) both 2 ft. 6 in. (0.76 m) wide on foundations 2 in. (5 cm) broader, create a double range c. 15 ft. (4.57 m) and 16 ft. (4-88 m) wide respectively. In the more northerly of these, two more cross-walls (F.28 and F.29), also 2 ft. 6 in. wide, create a single room about 15 ft. square and suggest additional rooms on each side. It is, however, difficult to make much sense of the rest of the internal arrangements owing to the destruction caused by later walls and foundations. What is suggested at this stage is a south range about 40 ft. (12.20 m) wide with what seems to have been an external ambulatory or portico 16 ft. 3 in. (4-95 m) wide and a range of rooms on its north side. Phase II The excavation also revealed another eight internal walls which did not form an integral part of the main structure, but which simply abutted pre-existing walls. These are here treated as a second phase of work although they could well have formed part of the original scheme. These were all 2 ft. 6 in. (0o76 m) in width and were built of flints set in yellow-brown mortar. Five of these walls (F.31-35) crossed the long east portico, dividing it into a series of rooms of varying sizes. The corresponding south portico was similarly divided-by a cross-wall (F.36) and the area to its west evenly subdivided by an additional east-west wall (F.37) of uncertain length. A narrow block of masonry (F.38) 6 ft. (1.83 m) long and I ft. 3 in. (0-38 m) wide, was at some time added to the west face of the internal north-south wall of the east range; it was found to be just 9 in. (22.8 cm)high and was obviously not intended as a load-bearing wall. It seems likely that it was the base for something more decorative than func- tional, but its precise purpose was not determined. There was no trace of any floor to this great building nor any detail of its superstructure or furnishings. Clearly it had been demolished in a very system- atic manner, and there can be little doubt that this was done as part of the con- struction programme of the late Flavian forum (Period V). The dating for the construction of the proto-forum is mostly circumstantial. A small amount of pottery was, however, recovered from an important se- quence of deposits against the south wall of the building (FIG. 23: S.2, L.I6- 28). There the Period III metalling (L.21) was sealed by a thick layer of orange brown clay (L.20) probably representing the levelled upcast from the founda- tion-trench of the south wall. This was sealed by a layer of black loam (L.I9) which was in turn partially sealed by ragstone chippings (L.I8), representing either a construction-level or perhaps a laid surface. The first and last deposits overlapped the offset foundation of the south wall and are clearly of later date. The pottery (Sam. Nos. 81-88) from these three layers is largely of pre-Flavian date. Unfortunately the Boudiccan fire debris stopped short of the east range by</page><page sequence="19">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 19 several feet and the critical connecting stratification had been destroyed by robber-trenches. However, the junction of the wall with its foundation must mark the approximate ground-level at the time of construction, and in general this is higher than the Period III floors further east. In addition the building post-dates both the Period II and Period III metalled areas across the west part of the site. On both counts, therefore, the structure should post-date A.D. 60 and happily this agrees with the earlier evidence."1 There is also some additional evidence which helps support this view. First, the proto-forum did not share a common frontage-line with the Period III buildings, but was set back 25 ft. (7.60 m) to the north. More significantly, it did not share a common axis with the Period III buildings as its axis lay some three degrees further to the east. Had it formed part of the Period III arrange- ments these anomalies could have been avoided, and it seems certain, there- fore, that it was laid out when the fire-debris still masked the original street and building lines. Indeed there is further significant evidence to confirm this suggestion. As we have seen, the north edge of the main east-west road had been buried by the falling debris (FIG. 4: S.IO, L.II). It is clear that when this road was re-established after the fire it was moved several feet to the north, even passing above the frontage-line of the buried Period III buildings. Clearly, it was either difficult or impossible to establish the precise lines of the pre-fire town. Everything considered, it seems highly likely that the proto-forum was con- structed in the decade 60-70 following the fire. The associated samian is largely Neronian and excludes late Flavian material. Certainly the large dumps of rubbish, dating to c. 75-85, immediately to the east, did not extend across the western part of the site and must have been limited by the presence of the proto-forum. Reconstruction of the proto-forum plan (FIG. 9) The projection of the external east wall coincides exactly with the alignment of walls recorded in 1908, and again in 1934,12 more than 150 ft. (45 m) to the north. The walls on both sites were similarly constructed of coursed ragstone over a triple course of tile, resting on deep foundations of mortared flint. In one place Frank Cottrill also found the wall to be 3 ft. (o.91 m) thick and he also recorded traces of three buttresses on both the east and north sides of his well-defined north-east corner. Three of these buttresses were 3 ft. long and one was 2 ft. 6 in. wide, thus matching the buttresses found during the 1968-9 excavation. The spacing, however, differs in that his buttresses were io ft. (3o05 m) apart, whereas the recent ones appear to have been spaced at intervals of 14 ft. (4.27 m). Apart from this small anomaly the considerable measure of agreement makes it virtually certain that both series of walls relate to a single R. Merrifield, The Roman City of London (1965), 138. 12 F.

The westward projection of the south range from the present site crosses Gracechurch Street to a site observed by Adrian Oswald in 1939.'3 This site occupies the junction of Lombard Street with Gracechurch Street and once contained All Hallows Church. No trace of the south wall of the building was then recorded, but clearly circumstances were far from ideal. Two short east- west walls were, however, located, and it seems clear from their alignments and description that they too formed part of the same building. More important, a study of the two site-plans shows that these walls were subsequently plotted 5 ft. (I.52 m) further north than actually recorded on the large-scale plan. With this correction and allowing for the unsatisfactory war-time conditions, it seems virtually certain that these two walls form part of a precisely matching west wing of the south range. This correction has been incorporated on the reconstructed plan (FIG. 9). In addition, the same site revealed two north-south walls of the same building; and by simple projection the south-west corner can be completed with reasonable certainty. More to the north another series of similarly aligned and similarly construc- ted walls, found by Frank Cottrill in 1935,14 seem certainly to represent the central part of the west range of the same structure. Their projection north- wards ties in with another wall found by Henry Hodge"5 in 1883-4 and two more walls found by Peter Marsden in 1964.16 It was already clear that the latter formed part of the same structure as those opposite on the east of Gracechurch Street: the circuit is thus complete. In detail it seems likely that the space between the cross-walls F.34 and F.35 contained a cross-wall not revealed during the present excavation and this has been added to the plan. This helps create a series of rooms, mostly 13-15 ft. (3-96-4-57 m) wide down the eastern side of the building. Similarly, the single square room in the south range probably reflects a row of about the same size and these have also been reconstituted on the plan. In the west range the evidence is fragmentary, but clearly a double or even triple range is indicated. The north range appears to have been at least 8o ft. (24-40 m) in width and to have contained a basement on its outer side. Beyond this it is difficult to be certain of the layout. Certainly a large central courtyard or perhaps two smaller ones must have been enclosed by the ranges; and significantly the central, long axis cuts the main east-west road precisely where the later forum axis strikes it too. Here, in all probability, was an entrance. The possible purpose and function of this building is discussed on p. 36 f. 13 A. Oswald, Notes in Guildhall Museum. 14 F.

Rubbish deposits No trace of any Period IV buildings, other than the bakehouse (see below) was found over the eastern part of the site, but thick bands of soil in that area probably represented dump for the Flavian forum (FIG. 3 (p. 8): Block Sections 7 and 8). The area immediately east of the proto-forum, however, was found to be covered with successive deposits of loam and rubbish (FIG. 23: S.I, L.2o-23 and 51-55; S.3, L.8--I6). These deposits contained large quanti- ties of samian (Sam. Nos. lo-67), coarse pottery (CP Nos. 19-68, 73-80 and 93-4) and four coins (Nos. 4-6 and I1). Three are of Claudian date and the fourth of Nero (A.D. 64-6), whilst the pottery ranges in date from c. 6o to c. 85. The large amount of samian is particularly interesting as it clearly includes pre-Flavian and Flavian material. Even taking the earliest possible date for each piece, a closing date of 75 is the earliest possible, but allowing for normal circulation a date nearer 85-90 seems more likely. From this evidence it seems probable that the area immediately east of the proto-forum was used for dump- ing soil and rubbish for many years after the Boudiccan fire. This conclusion is supported by the generally horizontal nature of the deposits which favour a gradual accumulation rather than a sudden dump of material derived from a distant source. 3. The bakehouse (FIG. 22 (facing p. 64) The rubbish deposits on the east side of the proto-forum were in turn overlaid by a gravel floor (FIG. 23: S.I, L.49) of a building of unknown size and extent. No trace of its walls was found, but it seems likely that it had been largely timber-framed, rectangular in plan, and that it fronted both the east street and the main east-west road. It contained traces of six circular ovens. Broadly similar ovens, almost invariably with a lateral opening, at Springhead17 and Trier18 have been identified as bread-ovens, and it is probable that the building here was a corner bakehouse. Three of the ovens formed a range (F.39-41), rectangular in plan, about 15 ft. (4-57 m) long and 5 ft. 6 in. (1-67 m) wide, constructed of brick- and tile- fragments laid horizontally in stiff clay (PL. IV A), and surviving to a maximum height of i ft. 8 in. (0o47 m) (FIG. 23: S.I, Oven I). Only two of the ovens survived in elevation, the third having been robbed; the other three (F.42 and, F.43) simply showed as incomplete circular patches representing earlier ovens replaced by the bank of three. In detail Oven i was 4 ft. (1.22 m) in diameter; it survived I ft. 3 in. (0-38 m) high and had an eastern opening i ft. 5 in. (0-43 m) wide. Oven 2 was 3 ft. 4 in. (I m) in diameter and it survived only 7 in. (17-8 cm) high. Oven 3 had been about 3 ft. 4 in. (I m) in diameter. The two surviving ovens were similarly constructed (FIG. IO). Each had been built in a circular hole dug in the underlying rubbish-deposits. The bottoms had 17 W. S. Penn, Arch. Cant., lxxi (1957), 53. n Kolner Jahrb.

These tiles packed in stiff clay were 7 and 8 inches high respectively, and both the bases were slightly convex in section. The base and the sides, also built of tile-fragments set in clay, had fused into a dense mass through intense heat. Exactly what the arrangements were above the surviving sections is not certain, though clearly they were fed from the east side.

In date, the bakehouse must certainly be later than the rubbish-layer upon which it was built. Although these provide a terminus post quem of 75 they were probably still forming as late as 85-90. Thus the bakehouse ought not to be earlier than this. Two coins (Nos. I4-15) both of Vespasian (A.D. 71) came from the gravel floor and from the base of Oven i respectively, and confirm the general dating. In addition five samian vessels (Sam. Nos. 68-72) were found in the gravel floor, one more (Sam. No. 73) came from the base of Oven I and another seven (Sam Nos. 74-80) had been packed in the clay wall of Oven i. These substantiate the dating and underline the total lack of second-century material. On balance it seems that the bakehouse was probably constructed c. 90o and that it was short-lived. Parts of the superstructure of the bakehouse were found lying over the ovens and to the south. They consisted of clean orange or brown clay, probably representing the infilling of a timber-framed wall. Its internal face had been rendered with a thin coat of white plaster, which had been painted a pink-red. It seems highly probable that this building was also destroyed as part of the extensive demolition-programme carried out when the forum proper was built. 4. The east street Three areas of metalling (F.44) were found along the east side of the proto- forum and seem to represent a north-south street over a distance of 120 ft. (36.60 m). The metalling consisted of a band of orange-yellow gravel (PL. IV B and FIG. 23: S.3, L.6 and 7) between 6 and 12 in. (o-15-o030 m) thick and just</page><page sequence="24">24 B. J. PHILP 12 ft. (3-66 m) wide. It clearly overlay both the Boudiccan fire-debris and the dumps of rubbish and loam. The gravel itself contained four samian vessels (Sam. Nos. 89-92) of Flavian or earlier date. Here too the underlying deposits show that the east road could not have been laid earlier than 75 and more likely not earlier than 85-90. In all probability it was built at about the same time as the adjacent bakehouse, perhaps c. 90. A small drainage-gully (F.45) roughly U-shaped in section (FIG. 23: S.3, L.5) and about 2 ft. (o.61 m) wide, had been dug diagonally across the road perhaps to take roof-water away from the east side of the proto-forum into the side-ditch of the main east-west road. The gully contained ragstone blocks and a group of samian (Sam. Nos. Ioi and 102) of Flavian date, a coin (No. 12) of (?) Nero (c. 66-68) and coarse pottery (CP Nos. 9I-2). A small pit, rectangular in section, (S.3, L.2) also cut the road and was found to contain eight samian vessels (Sam. Nos. 93-1oo) mostly of Flavian date. Again there is an absence of second- century forms. It is also clear that the main east-west road was remetalled after the Boudiccan fire, though it moved several feet northwards, owing to the fire debris masking the earlier limits (FIG. 4: S.Io, L.Io). PERIOD V (C. 90-100o) Both the Period IV proto-forum and the bakehouse were deliberately demo- lished during a large-scale redevelopment of the centre of the Roman town. There can be little doubt that this formed part of the grandiose scheme to build a massive basilica-forum complex over and far beyond the proto-forum area. Indeed on the present site huge dumps of soil representing builders' levelling for the scheme were found over much of the area, and these were cut through by the foundations of the south range of the new forum (Period V). I. The south range of the forum It was known from earlier excavations, notably those by Adrian Oswald in 1939'9 that the south range of the forum might cross the general area, as walls of likely character had been found by him on the All Hallows site to the west. The assumption proved correct: four massive rubble foundations were found running roughly east-west across the excavation (FIG 22). These foundations were generally c. 9 ft. (2-74 m) deep, c. 4 ft. (1.22 m) wide and built mainly of ragstone, though also incorporating fragments of tile, flint and mortar (PL.V A). The four foundations were parallel, similarly constructed and clearly related to the same structure. The south wall (F.46) was only 3 ft. 8 in. (I-i I m) wide and this was traced for 120 ft. (36-58 m) (PL. V B). The south-centre wall (F.47) was 4 ft. thick (1.22 m) and was traced for 104 ft. (31.70 m). The north-centre wall "1 See note 13.</page><page sequence="25">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 25 (F.48) was also 4 ft. wide and was traced for just 100 ft. The three divisions created by these four foundations were (north to south) 29 ft., 23 ft., and 18 ft. wide respectively (8-84, 7-oo and 5-48 m) and the overall measurement (includ- ing the width of the foundations) was 84 ft. 6 in. (25-75 m). This tripartite arrangement is a feature common to many British fora.20 There was no trace of any internal division of the two flanking elements, and this supports the view that these were long covered porticoes. There was, how- ever, clear evidence that the central division had been subdivided to create a series of rooms such as are found in other fora and represent either offices or shops. Three north-south cross-walls (F.50-52) each about 4 ft. (1.22 m) wide, were found; they appeared to form an integral part of the main structure and created two large rooms, a west one about 33 ft. by 23 ft. (o0-05 by 7oo0 m) and a longer east one about 46 ft. by 23 ft. (14-02 by 700oo m). Rather strangely, the two central east-west foundations of the south range each contained a short section (FIG. 22: F. 53 and F.54) of narrower wall, 3 ft. 3 in. (I m) and 3 ft. 6 in. (I.o6 m) wide respectively, which appears to have been inserted at a later date. This tends to imply a phased programme of work. Neither end of the inserted wall was seen along the north-centre foundation, but a clear gap of 6 in. (o-15 m) was found between the adjacent ends of the south-centre wall-foundation on its west side. This junction occurred roughly in line with the bakehouse ovens and the corresponding east junction must have been less than c. 28 ft. (8-50 m) away as the broader foundation continued again at that point. A possible reason for this variation in construction is sug- gested below (p. 26). The foundation of the Period V forum cut right across the walls of the proto-forum and the bakehouse; clearly both must have been demolished. The clay walls of the bakehouse had been pushed down over the ovens and to the south, but the stone walls of the proto-forum had only been dismantled to just above foundation level and no doubt the materials re-used. In most cases the forum foundations cut through the earlier walls regardless, but in two places, on the south-centre wall line, they over-rode the pre-existing walls which were thus left largely intact as shown on FIG. 22. Once the bulk of the earlier masonry had been removed, thick layers of rubbish, rubble and soil brought the ground-level up by nearly 3 ft. (o090 m) (FIG. 23: S.I, L.38-43; S.2, L.2-I7). This was probably done to raise the south end of the forum complex almost to the level of its otherwise higher north end on Cornhill. The south wall was thus also a retaining wall for the dumped soil and this function is reflected in its stronger construction. No trace of any solid forum floor was found any- where on the site, and in general it must have been higher than about 44 ft. O.D. Thin bands of localised opus signinum (as in FIG. 23: S.I, L.39; S.2, L.6), normally two feet lower, probably represent mixing-floors in use during the building of the superstructures. The main east-west road was again remetalled (FIG. 2 (p. 6): S.4, L.I3; 20 J. Wacher, Towns of Roman Britain (1975), 42-6.</page><page sequence="26">26 B. J. PHILP FIG. 4: S.Io, L.8) and expanded northwards to flank the new external wall. It was subsequently remetalled at least four times (S.4, L.4,6,8 and 12). What is of particular interest is that the forum foundations were laid out on an axis slightly different from that of the proto-forum. The builders had swung the main axis several degrees northwards, almost back to the alignment of the Period III buildings. From this it seems that the street-plan laid out in pre- Boudiccan times was eventually re-established and that the mis-alignment taken up after the fire was largely corrected. The site produced substantial evidence for the date of the construction of at least the south range of the forum. First, this part of the building must date after the demolition of the bakehouse and proto-forum through which it was certainly built. The bakehouse (p. 22) incorporated quantities of samian pottery and two coins which prove that it could not have been built earlier than 75 and very probably not till c. go. This dating is confirmed by the large group of pottery from the rubbish-deposits underneath the bakehouse. Secondly, not a single coin or sherd from any of the rubbish layers or dumps of soil thrown down for the forum make-up proved to be later than c. Too. Indeed all is either Flavian or pre-Flavian (Coin Nos. 7 and io; Sam. Nos. 103-II6; CP Nos. 3, 69-72, 81-9o; SF Nos. 2-4). Thirdly, the limited sealed evidence from areas in the forum-basilica21 is mainly of Flavian date and this cumulatively tends to confirm a pre-second-century construction date. Only'on one site,22 close to the presumed forum entrance, has a single sherd been found (under unsatisfactory conditions) to hint at later dating - and this at a point where a second-century, or later, phase of construction was detected (see p. 43). On the available evidence, therefore, it seems probable that the forum scheme was started in late Flavian times, probably in the last decade of the first century. One remaining consideration arises from the inference that the south range of the forum formed part of a phased programme of work. If so, it is just possible that the bakehouse was in operation during the opening stages of building of the south range, and thus the dating evidence of the bake- house could be held to apply to a later phase of the forum scheme. However, the sum of the evidence from this and other sites shows that it is scarcely pos- sible for the overall forum scheme to have started much earlier than c. 85. 2. The east range of the forum (FIG. I3, P. 38) A regular watch was kept on the site throughout most of 1969, and in Septem- ber the contractors were found to have made a narrow extension at the north- east corner. This flanked the south side of Ship Tavern Passage and broke through into Lime Street. Here three massive masonry foundations were ex- posed running on a north-south axis. It seems certain that these represent part of the east range of the forum. The west and centre foundations were just about 21 R. Merrifield, op. cit. (note II), 136. 22 R. Merrifield, op. cit.

The centre and east foundations were spaced about 40 ft. (12-20 m) apart; it seems that an intermediate wall is miss- ing. If so the east foundation could represent the outer wall of the east range, but the spacing does not agree. The centres of these three foundations were located at 92 ft. 6 in., 69 ft. and 25 ft. (28-04, 21.03 and 7.62 m), respectively, west of the west frontage-line of Lime Street.

On this foundation were four courses of finely squared ragstone blocks and a single tile-course. Above this, offset about 3 in. (7-6 cm) inwards, were three more courses of tile set in a pale yellow mortar (FIG. I I). The east founda- tion appeared as a shapeless mass of ragstone which, being dangerously poised over deep unsupported trenches, was not examined. It seemed to have been about 4 ft. (I-22 m) wide and at least 3 ft. (o091 m) high. 3. Piers and pier-bases (FIGS. 14, 22) The remnants of ten separate tile piers, or ragstone pier-bases, were revealed at various times across the western half of the site. A line of three bases (Piers I-3, F.55-57 on FIG. 22) ran east-west near the south limit of the site, with a centre-to-centre spacing of 16 ft. (4-88 m). All had been rectangular, measured roughly 7 by 4 ft. (2.13 by I-22 m) and had been built of ragstone rubble in yellow mortar. Each almost certainly had carried a somewhat smaller tile pier, but only a ragged L-shaped portion of Pier I survived. This measured 3 by I ft. (o-91 by 0.30 m) and may represent a tile pier about 6 by 4 ft. (1.83 by I-22 m). The base of the tiles, of which seven courses set in opus signinum survived, was at about 42 ft. O.D. The three bases lay north of the south forum wall, with an estimated gap of about 9 ft. (2*74 m) when the piers were completed, but were clearly built against and partly over the external face of the partially demolished south wall of the proto-forum. Pier 3 clearly used the pre-existing corner-buttress of the proto-forum and it must be that the builders of the pier-bases were largely aware of the earlier building. The damaged base of an almost identical pier (Pier 4, F. 58) was found about 25 ft. (7.60 m) to the north, again sitting partially over a pre-existing wall (F.26). Only its north face and north-east corner were found. Pier 5 (F.59), about 30 ft. (9-15 m) north-west of Pier 4, was sectioned by the contractor's mechanical excavator. The base was not exposed, but 12 courses of tiles set in yellow mortar survived, the top one being at c. 43 ft. O.D. It was 4 ft. 3 in. (I.30 m) wide north-south and 2 ft. 2 in. (0.67 m) in minimum east-west width. Piers 6 and 7 (F.6o and 61) were found north-east of Pier 5. Like Pier 5, Pier 6 was sectioned by the contractors and no base was seen (PL. VI B). All that was observed was a series of eleven Roman tiles laid horizontally in yellow mortar with an actual east-west width of 4 ft. (1.22 m). Above these were three more courses of tiles set in pink mortar, off-set to the east by i ft. 2 in. (0.31 m) and suggesting two periods of construction. Its top also was at c. 43 ft. O.D. Pier 7 (F.61 and FIG. I2) was sliced through its centre by the contractor's narrow trench for sheet-piles (PL. VII A). Its large ragstone-rubble base was 6 ft. 6 in. (I-98 m) wide (north-south) and its top was located at 40o.67 ft. O.D. On it, off-centre to the north, was a fine tile pier 4 ft. 6 in. (1-37 m) long north- south by 4 ft. (1-22 m) wide east-west. The lower nine courses of' tile were set in yellow mortar and the upper two, inset fractionally to the south, were set in</page><page sequence="29">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 29 opus signinum. To judge by the similar character of Piers 6 and 7 it seems likely that they formed part of a series, running east-west, probably of two distinct periods of construction.

It cut the wall of the proto-forum very neatly; it measured 4 ft. 6 in. (I137 m) by 4 ft. 2 in. (1-27 m) and was built of ragstone set in yellow mortar (PL. VII B). Pier 9 (F.63) was seen in section in the contractor's trenches which were here 15 ft. deep and continually collapsing. It was im- possible to record in detail, but a series of tile-courses 4 or 5 ft. wide represented</page><page sequence="30">30 B. J. PHILP a substantial pier sitting on a more massive ragstone base. At the bottom of the contractor's trench was a substantial north-south foundation of flint and rag- stone which was traced for a minimum length of 26 ft. (7-92 m). Although examination was impossible it seemed that it ran under the bases of both Piers 7 and 9 and that it descended at least as deep as 32 ft. O.D. Just possibly this foundation related to the proto-forum, but it gave the impression of being a massive sleeper-wall for the piers. Pier Io (F.64) was located in a narrow, dark underpinning-trench with the aid of a torch right under Ship Tavern Passage on the north side of the site. Its position so far north of all the other piers and bases is puzzling. Its rag- stone base, 3 ft. (o091 m) high and at least 4 ft. (I-22 m) wide, sat on and to the west of the proto-forum wall, and the pier itself consisted of four courses of brick set in yellow mortar. Only part of the south face of the pier, just 2 ft. 3 in. wide, was seen. A thin 2-inch layer of opus signinum ran to the bottom layer of bricks and sealed the broader foundation on this side. This may well have marked an important construction-level and above it was a dump of brown loam and gravel 2 ft. thick. This in turn was capped by I-inch bands of mortar and loam respectively, sealing which was a 3-inch mixed layer of white mortar and opus signinum. From the available evidence it seems clear that all ten piers post-date the proto-forum. Eight fall within the limits of the south range of the actual forum and two others lie further north. These and other similar piers found in I925 and 1939 to the immediate west seem largely confined to the centre of the south range of the forum. It seems likely that some, if not most, relate to a monu- mental entrance at this point (see p. 4I). TANKS, WELLS AND PITS (Not in chronological order) Tanks (FIG. 22: F.66-72) Seven rectangular tanks were found. All were lined with mortared walls up to 2 ft. (o.6I m) thick. Four were constructed of chalk blocks, two of which con- tained pottery of late medieval date; one, built of ragstone, contained I6th- and 17th-century pottery and the other two, brick-built, contained material of i8th-century date, Each had been dug from a point higher than the cellar floor and the bases were at or above the surface of natural soil (c. 36 ft. O.D.). The majority were heavily-stained and it is probable that all were cess-pits. Some, it seems, were open for a century or more and may have been cleared at intervals. The three tanks on the north side of the site were probably situated behind or adjacent to houses on what is now the south side of Ship Tavern Passage. The four on the south side were probably behind houses on the north side of what is now Fenchurch Street.

The Claudian lay-out (Period III) It is clear, for the first time on a London site, that at least part of the pre- Boudiccan town was laid out in a formal manner with substantial buildings. The evidence suggests that at least three large timber-framed buildings on an east-west axis covered the eastern part of the site, two on the north side of the main east-west street and a third to the north again, separated from them by a minor street (p. Io, FIG. 5). To the west a large metalled zone appears to have remained an open area. A broad rectilinear pattern emerges, suggesting an arrangement of alternating streets and insulae. The technique of building with wooden piles is matched on at least one other London site, at Bush Lane,23 where part of a possible Roman military store- house of pre-Flavian date was found by Tony Johnson in 1972. The same tech- nique was also employed on the Claudian military storehouses at Richborough.24 More particularly the buildings may usefully be compared with the pre-Boudic- can structures excavated by Sheppard Frere at Verulamium25 in 1957-9 and those found by Rosalind Dunnett at Colchester in 1965.26 With London these two towns were destroyed during the Boudiccan uprising and similar graphic fire-debris has been recovered from both sites. Although at Verulamium the buildings under the fire-debris did not incorporate piles, very similar sleeper- beams were widely employed and as at London the walls were mostly of timber- framed daub. At Colchester most of the superstructure was daub, but the longi- tudinal walls rested on masonry sleepers. As at London wooden water-pipes demonstrate advanced water-engineering. At all three sites the internal floors were of clay, and painted plaster was used; only at Colchester and London is there certain evidence of tiled roofs. The function of the buildings of Period III is as obscure as the details of their plan, particularly as they appear to have been virtually empty at the time of the fire. The Colchester building contained numerous largely complete pottery vessels and that at Verulamium has been identified as a row of shops. Like the southernmost building on FIG. 5, the Verulamium building flanked a major street; a second point of comparison is offered by its portico, i i ft. 6 in. wide, which ran along the frontage and one other side. This is almost exactly the position in the London building, where a portico of about this width flanks the street and appears to return, somewhat narrower, round the west end. In addi- tion the Verulamium shops have a double range of rooms behind the portico each about 18-20 ft. (6 m) wide, thus giving a total width of about 51 ft. (15-2 m). A double range of rooms best suits the surviving evidence at London, where the internal widths would be about 16 ft. (4-88 m) and the overall width 23 T. Johnson, Trans. London &amp; Middlesex Arch.

Journ. cxxiii (1966), 31.</page><page sequence="34">34 B. J. PHILP about 44 ft. (I3-41 m). On the evidence thus far, civilian shops seem to be indicated. The possibility, however, that the buildings of Period III were military needs to be considered. That Roman London began as a military base is a concept now becoming widely accepted; indeed, its strategic position on the largest river in Britain and at the focal point of a radiating system of military roads leaves little doubt of its origins. The evidence in the ground is somewhat scat- tered, but if London were garrisoned during the Conquest period then it must be that the troops were barracked within a fortified position of fairly standard form. It is likely that Periods I and II were in fact military and the discovery in recent years of Conquest-period fortifications at Colchester,27 Verulamium,28 Chichester29 and Chelmsford30 supports this suggestion. In plan, the Period III structures seen on FIG. 5, if we assume that all three buildings ended in line with the western end of the most southerly, present a clear resemblance to a group of barracks. Their widths of 44 ft., however, well exceed the widths of known barracks in first-century auxiliary forts, and even the legionary barracks at Inchtuthil31 were only 36 ft. wide. Only at Longthorpe32 is there anything of this order of width. If barracks, then, they would probably be legionary and would require a length of c. 280 ft. But apart from the general lack of military fittings on this site there is a further piece of evidence which argues strongly against these buildings being barracks; this is based upon their position in the putative fort and depends on a discussion of the axis of Roman London. The evidence on this site proves that the east-west street, roughly under Fenchurch Street, was one of the principal streets throughout most or all of the Roman period. It was remetalled at least seven times between Period I and Period V. The Claudian timber-framed buildings, the Neronian proto-forum and the late Flavian forum all flanked this street, traces of which have been found over 370 yards.33 That the central axis of both the proto-forum and the forum basilica complex meet this street at right-angles (under present-day Gracechurch Street) on a line which strikes the probable site of the Roman river-bridge near Fish Street Hill, may be especially significant. If a north-south bridge street can be identified and the military origin of both streets be accepted, then the focal point of the military base is fixed with the proven east-west street forming the via principalis and the inferred north-south street forming the via praetoria. This would place any principia directly under both the later proto-forum and the succeeding forum which were themselves the focal point of Roman London from Neronian times onwards. Indeed this is a logical sequence and one which occurs at Gloucester34 27 P. Crummy, in this volume of Britannia. 28 S. S. Frere, Britannia, A History of Roman Britain (1967), 248. 29 A.

Significantly or not, such an area includes most of the sites where the Boudiccan fire-debris has so far been recorded and also a somewhat enigmatic early-looking masonry building off Lombard Street. So, too, could such a base help to explain the strange street-plan of Roman London with its marked change of alignment west of Walbrook. This variation could mark a secondary westward extension of the street-system. Nor need the other east- west street, along Cannon Street, conflict with the suggested military lay-out. It runs parallel to the suggested via principalis and could either divide in roughly equal parts the praetentura of a large fort, or form an extra-mural street. Although a principia in the forum area would explain the presence of open gravel areas, perhaps representing a courtyard, it is difficult to see the Period III buildings as part of it. They lie roughly Ioo to 200 ft. (30-60 m) east of the central axis and their plan conflicts with what would be expected of the south- east quarter of even a large principia. Still less is it likely that they could repre- sent barracks in a position within the central range of the fort adjacent to and parallel with the via principalis; this would be a situation quite without parallel. It is probably significant that the buildings of Period II below seem to have their axis at right-angles to this. On balance, therefore, the evidence favours the interpretation of the build- ings of Period III as being civilian and perhaps shops, though employing tech- niques introduced by the army. This in turn suggests that from c. 50 the centre of London was abandoned to redevelopment as a civilian mercantile centre. Yet the excavated structures, little though they are known in detail, do present an air of purposeful planning more appropriate to an official foundation than to the results of free enterprise. Nevertheless, in the light of Tacitus's descrip- tion of the town in 6o, and in the absence of any provision for a forum and basilica earlier than the proto-forum, it is difficult to suppose that London was a chartered city in the fifties; nor was it a civitas-capital. If the lay-out of Period III appears too formal and rigid for the results of spontaneous mercan- tile development, the possibility may be entertained that here at the core of the settlement lay an official establishment of some size, the procurator's offices or even the governor's headquarters. This is a possibility which it must be left to future research to investigate; the evidence at present available serves only to pose rather than to solve the question. 2. The proto-forum (Period IV) (FIG. 9, P. 21) For the first time it is possible to consider this building as an almost complete entity, oblong in form, about 350 by 200 ft. (lo6-70 by 6o096 m) overall and covering an area of about IT acres (o-6i ha). It is clear that it must have " J. Wacher, Towns of Roman Britain (1975), 399.</page><page sequence="36">36 B. J. PHILP dominated the centre of Roman London in the post-fire decades, perhaps even occupying the site of an earlier military principia. No other known London building was of comparable size at this time and it was only superseded by the great forum-basilica complex built at the end of the first century. Significantly, the later forum occupied the same central site. What then was the function of this great building? Merrifield3" has suggested that it was a 'public building' and Wacher37 has recently suggested that it was the tabularium Caesaris of the procurator. It seems certain that the procurator, the Emperor's own provincial finance-officer, was based in London from the time of the Boudiccan revolt as the tombstone of Classicianus demonstrates, if not earlier. Thus London can fairly claim to have been the financial centre of the Province from at least 6o. In recent years its status as capital has been dis- cussed at length. Richmond38 was prepared to accept that it gained this posi- tion by A.D. Ioo, and Merrifield and others have more recently advanced the date to Flavian times. The construction of a palace, almost certainly the prae- torium of the provincial governor, near present-day Cannon St. Station,39 in c. 8o-Ioo adds useful confirmation. The possibility that its site was being prepared in the period 6o-8o suggests the presence of the governor somewhat earlier. The proto-forum itself appears to have comprised a series of four ranges around a central courtyard, or courtyards. The main range appears to have been on the north side, being some 8o ft. (24.38 m) wide and incorporating a semi-basement. The east and south ranges appear to have contained a number of rooms of varying size. Indeed had this structure appeared in any other Romano-British town it would unhesitatingly have been identified as the forum. Its general shape and form are anyway not unlike the fora of Wroxeter40 and Cirencester,41 though it is slightly smaller than both. Abroad, what seems to be a significant parallel occurs at Aequum in Dalmatia.42 There the forum, prob- ably of Claudian date, corresponds well in shape, size and also in some detail with the London proto-forum. This identification raises the question of the status of early Roman London. There is the statement by Tacitus43 that (in 6o) London did not hold the title of colonia, but that it was a great centre of com- merce, crowded with traders at the time of the revolt. Whilst this may be fair comment for the period before 6o it is no good reason for supposing that London's status remained unchanged thereafter. As a major centre it may have held the title municipium early on. Indeed what more natural after the revolt than to remove much of the provincial administration from the some- 36 R.

London was anyway beside the largest river in the Province and a vital centre of communication. Certainly within 30 years of the revolt self-governing status had been awarded and the grand forum- basilica complex had been started. Significantly, this new scheme can now be seen to have enveloped the earlier building on three clear sides as part of a cleverly phased architectural programme. On completion the site and perhaps the function of the earlier building had been taken over. Even so the tantalising questions of London's early status and the function of this massive central building must await more evidence; but for the purposes of this text and in the absence of a more convenient name it is here described as the proto-forum of London. 3. The Reconstruction of the Plan of the Forum-Basilica Complex (Period V) (FIG. 13) With the new evidence from the present site it is possible, for the first time, to produce a coherent plan of the Roman forum and to consider it in relation to the great basilica. The external foundations, traced for at least 140 ft. (42-65 m) across the present site, clearly represent the east wing of the south range of the actual forum. These foundations largely over-ride the walls of the proto-forum and span a total width of 84 ft. 6 in. (25.75 m). As significant differences from earlier composite plans of the building began to appear, special efforts were made many times over a period of five months to fix the position of the recently discovered foundations with maximum precision. This having been done, it is clear that a number of corrections must be applied elsewhere. First, it is clear that the forum foundations found on the corresponding All Hallows site are wrongly aligned, and must have been in- correctly plotted, in what were difficult war-time conditions. The projection of the newly discovered foundations towards the All Hallows site, on the opposite side of Gracechurch Street, show that the foundations found in 1939 need to be swung southwards by about 5'. The new line cuts the east side of Gracechurch Street at 830 and the west side at 840, the two frontages being not quite parallel. The 1939 plan shows the west axis as 79" and the 1965 general- ised plan44 as 800. In addition, on the 1939 large-scale site-plan the forum width is shown as about 84 ft., which corresponds well with the 84 ft. 6 in. on the present site, whereas this has strangely expanded to 89 ft. on the 1939 small- scale plan and to 92 ft. on the 1965 generalised plan. Certainly there is here an error of 5-6 ft. With the line of the south range of the forum firmly fixed there is also a dis- crepancy with the axis of the basilica if, as suspected, the two were parallel. Henry Hodge showed the angle of the main wall of the basilica with the west side of Gracechurch Street as 760 and this has recently been demonstrated by 4' R.

On the generalised plan of 1965 the angle is shown as 8o0 but if the basilica was parallel to the south range of the forum then the angle needs to be 83'. Indeed this correction produces a much better reconcilia- tion with the presumed west end of the basilica in the Cornhill area. Even there a variation of 2' exists, as can be shown on various plans subsequent to the initial discovery in 1891.47 At the east end of Gracechurch Street correction throws the basilica further to the south, which is exactly what is required. For a check at several points on the RCHM large-scale plan of Henry Hodge's work shows that it should in fact be swung southwards of the 1965 line by the re- quired amount. A final check is now available on this new alignment and largely confirms it. The projected lines of the Hodge east range, as shown on the generalised 1965 plan, places the walls too far towards Lime Street by about 10 ft. (3 m). As at least two of the walls of the east range were recorded during the present excava- tion, the precise line of the east range is now clear. The positions of the walls agree very closely with the alignment-projection based on the correction of the basilica axis here suggested. The north end of the east range was noted by Henry Hodge. There he found a series of four parallel north-south walls, with a total span of about 85 ft. (25-90 m) flanked by road-metalling to the east. The walls were spaced, west to east, at intervals of about 22 ft., 24 ft. and 18 ft. (6-71, 7-32 and 5-49 m), and the walls were 3 ft. io in., 4 ft. Io in., 4 ft. 7 in. and 3 ft. 11 in. wide respectively (1-16, 1-47, 1-37 and 1-20 m). Certainly the widths of the two westernmost foundations agree very well with the two certain foundations found in the north-east corner of the present site (p. 27) and confirm their identification. Of the west range of the forum there is only slight evidence. Three walls found south of Castle Court (marked M, J, K, L, on the 1965 plan) also had an overall width of about 85 ft. and were flanked by the west line of road- metalling (marked X). These walls must surely represent the west range of the forum. The two eastern walls are spaced at about 20 ft. (6.1o m) and this would represent the internal portico as on the east side. The other wall is spaced about 50 ft. (15-23 m) to the west, a width which could comfortably embrace both the central section and external portico. The lengths of wall seen were too short to determine the precise axis. There thus now exists evidence for swinging the whole forum-basilica com- plex on its axis several degrees to the south. The result is a highly symmetrical arrangement, nicely framed around the proto-forum. Indeed the probability is that the proto-forum may well have stood intact and in use whilst the east, west and basilica ranges were substantially completed. If so the proto-forum would 45 P.

PHILP have been demolished when the south range was constructed as part of a phased programme of work for which there was evidence on the present site. The certain difference in axis between the two buildings, noted on every site where they have been seen adjacent, seems to be about 3'. Certainly this was the variation on the present site; Henry Hodge made it c. 20; on the difficult All Hallows plan it is as much as 7' and on the 1965 generalised plan it is shown as 5'. With the outline of the forum now reasonably clear the overall dimensions of the forum-basilica complex can be seen to have been about 555 ft. (169.16 m) from east to west and about 545 ft. (I66-io m) from north to south. It thus covered an area of about 7 acres (2-80 ha) and was the largest forum in Britain, outstripping Cirencester48 which was c. 550 by 345 ft.; Wroxeter,49 c. 394 by 265 ft.; Silchester,50 c. 313 by 275 ft., and Verulamium,51 c. 460 by 375 ft. What is also clear and of considerable significance is that the axis of the forum-basilica complex is returned, almost exactly, to that of the pre-Boudic- can town-plan. The new alignment taken by the proto-forum after the fire was clearly not acceptable to the builders of the forum-basilica complex. From this it seems that the factors governing the pre-Boudiccan plan were still relevant at the end of the first century; presumably the fire-debris had caused problems of alignment immediately after the fire of 60. The axes of both the proto-forum and the forum-basilica complex have an important bearing on the street-plan of the Roman city-centre and very likely on the siting of the Roman bridge over the Thames. In contrast to the mislead- ing suggestions made in the earlier part of this century that the London street- system radiated from the bridge, Merrifield has shown that there is good evi- dence for an orthodox grid-system, at least east of the Walbrook. In view of this and the probable military origins of the street-plan, there is a good chance that a principal street ran directly from the bridge on a grid line to the forum area. Significantly, the central axes of both the proto-forum and the forum- basilica if projected strike the river-bank slightly east of Fish Street Hill, the site most favoured by writers through the centuries for the Roman bridge. That the axes strike the river-bank at different points may possibly imply two bridges,. one pre-Boudiccan and another built after the fire. The discovery of substantial road-metalling on a site much further west in Southwark could reflect a variety of circumstances and need not affect the issue.52 4. The Forum Entrance (FIG. 14) It seems clear that the concentration of massive brick piers and pier-bases, each side of the central axis of the forum in the centre of the south range, im- ,8 See note 41. 49 See note 40.

Merrifield and H. Sheldon, ibid., II No. 8 (1974).</page><page sequence="41">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 41 plies a major structural variation at this point. That these piers range over an east-west length of 125 ft. (38-1o m) and a north-south width of about 100 ft. (30-50 m) suggests a feature of monumental proportions. There can be little doubt that this was the main entrance to the forum, on the main axis, facing the presumed road to the river-crossing in one direction and the great basilica in the other. Whilst comparatively little is known in detail of the main en- trances of British fora, a central position in the range facing the basilica was certainly adopted at Caistor-by-Norwich,53 Silchester,54 and Caerwent." With ten new piers on the present site and eight more discovered on the op- posite corner in 1925 and 1939, it is possible to offer a tentative reconstruction of the suggested entrance. Ignoring those piers which seem random, particu- larly Pier io far beyond the south range, three clear alignments seem to be suggested. The first runs east-west along the outer portico of the south range. Piers 1-3 found on the present site were spaced at 16 ft. (4-88 m) centres and correspond with three more (Piers II--13) found on the west side of Grace- church Street. They too were spaced at about I6 ft. centres and their line, given the small correction which the All Hallows site certainly requires (p. 37), agrees entirely. Several more may be conjecturally restored on this line to offer a total width of this structural feature of about i8o ft. (54-86 m). Even on the scant 1925 evidence, Wheeler was prepared"6 to suggest an imposing arcade in the south range and this now seems substantially confirmed. Exactly how this fitted in with the south portico, along which the piers were built, is difficult to gauge. Possibly the outer south wall of the range simply served here as a re- taining wall for the generally high-level forum which was clearly raised above the flanking-east-west road. At the very least, steps would have been needed to reach the portico; and perhaps one day these will be found. Alternatively, the piers may simply represent a subsequent phase of construction replacing a les- ser entrance perhaps never completed. On the north side of the conjectured entrance, two more piers (Nos. 7 and 9) on the present site can be seen to be parallel to two others (Piers 17 and 18) on the All Hallows site, given the same correction. Both lines seem equidistant from the central axis. Another three (Piers 14-16) at All Hallows fall on the same line as two of the newly discovered ones (Piers 6 and 7). A number of additional piers seems implied by this pattern and a clear rectangular outline emerges. This projects about 18 ft. (5-50 m) into the forum piazza: a formal entrance of monumental nature is implied. No other British forum has so far produced corresponding evidence on this scale. Nor are continental parallels satisfactory, save one. At Rome itself the almost contemporary Forum of Trajan, although the largest in Rome, was actually smaller in area than the London forum. It, too, had a monumental entrance in the centre of the south 3 S. S. Frere, Britannia ii (1971), 6. 4 See note 50. 5 T.

Nor does the similarity end there. The colonnaded Trajanic entrance, more than Ioo ft. in width, projected into the piazza as did that at London, though it also pro- jected externally. A further point also calls for comment. Two of the brick piers on the present site and several of those on the All Hallows site exhibited two types of con- struction. The upper parts were set in red mortar and were offset on the lower parts which were set in yellow mortar. Clearly two phases of construction are implied, and this is confirmed by an extensive mortar spread on the All Hallows site which covered the lower sections and butted to the upper. A very similar situation was noted at Pier 7 (FIG. 12, p. 29) where two separate mortar spreads representing construction-phases (L.2 and 5) demonstrate a modification in the original plan and also the degree of slumping caused by compression through the centuries. The mortar layers at All Hallows sealed material no later than Hadrianic in date and must represent a second stage in the forum entrance, not earlier than the second quarter of the second century. The under- lying first phase probably dates from the end of the first century when the basilica-forum complex was built. THE FINDS Table of Periods Period I. c. A.D. 43 Initial occupation of site.

Lower zone: another scroll, this time with seven-lobed leaves, six-segmented fronds and a small lanceolate leaf. The lower concavities have a saltire motif, with striated rod swags. Most of the details can be found in the work of Meddillus; cf. Knorr 1953, Taf. 39c for a very similar upper zone; the saltire appears at Rottweil (Knorr 1919, Taf. 54) with the striated rods. Note the habit of placing barley-ears beneath figure-types in the upper and lower zones of that vessel, compared with the present upper zone. Other details are shown on Taf. 54: the swag 17, lanceolate leaf 32 and bud 42. The cordate leaf may be different, because an exact parallel has recently been found on a stamped 29 from the Walbrook (G.H. 19812). Other connected potters with this type of design are Iucundus and Iustus. c. A.D. 65-80. S.G. (Fig. 16, No.16). 76. Form 18 R (two). Flavian. S.G. 77. Form 18. Pre-Flavian. S.G. 78. Form 18 (six).

By Peter Couldrey The main merit of the coarse pottery from this site is that it is securely dated by associated coins and samian ware and particularly by the well-defined stratigraphic divisions. Of the large quantity of pottery found, 95 vessels are illustrated here. Whilst</page><page sequence="51">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 51 12 0 QQ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 FIG. 16.

PHILP no attempt has yet been made to produce a definitive study of all the material, pro- visional classification suggests that five main groups can be distinguished by fabric. A brief description of these groups is given here, followed by a catalogue of the illus- trated sherds. Group A: coarse sandy ware This group consists of pottery characterised by a fabric which is hard and sandy to the touch. The sherds are well-fired and, except two orange vessels, have a grey paste. The forms include flanged dishes (Nos. 78, 79 and 84), a mortarium (No. Io), a flagon (No. 94), and a lid (No. 67), though the majority are vessels with beaded or outcurved rims. There are no clear imports in this group and the vessels with beaded and out- curved rims are generally well-known from this period. A burnished platter (No. 22) is similar to 'sub-Belgic' examples from Colchester57 and represents a native copy of Gallo-Belgic types of between 43 and 69. The conical ring-neck of a flagon (No. 94) with a thick flat-topped rim is like Camulodunum forms 154-5, which occur from Claudian times. Group B: fine sandy ware The only difference between this group and the previous one is that the fabric feels finer. Most of the vessels are jars and dishes, though flagons (Nos. 77 and 82) a mortarium (No. 69) and handles of a bowl (No. 2) a flagon (No. 60) and an amphora (No. 95) also occur. Some necked jars (Nos. 33, 64 and 90o), which resemble Belgic pedestal urns, also bear strong similarities to Flavian types such as those found from the Roman Palace site in London.58 Other examples (Nos. i6, 44, 65, 86 and 87) probably belong to the same catagory. Three platters with roundly curved, concave sides (Nos. 6i, 62 and 76) but without footrings are grey vessels, influenced by Camu- lodunum form 17, beginning perhaps in Flavian times. Other platters (Nos. 23, 70 and 71) are native imitations of Gallo-Belgic forms of the post-conquest period and com- pare with the 'sub-Belgic' types from Camulodunum, though the most complete example (No. 71) is without a footring. The only certain import is the amphora handle (No. 95) which bears the stamp POR.C.P.R. Variations of this stamp have been found on amphorae at Rome and Pompeii, but the closest example is from Richborough.59 Group C: mottled ware Several vessels have a porridgy grey paste which is very rough to the touch. This is here referred to as mottled. This group comprises three main forms: cooking-pots with bead rims (Nos. 8, 24, 49 and 5o), and with flanged rims (Nos. 37, 38, 54 and 55) and vessels with outcurved and everted rims (Nos. 29, 30, 34, 35, 53 and 58). The flanged vessels are particularly characteristic and Nos. 54 and 55 are matched at the London Roman Palace site,60 where they are dated to the Flavian period. Group D: smooth ware A wide variety of forms are found in a hard smooth ware. They include rolled and 7 C. F. Hawkes and M. R. Hull, Camulodunum (1947), 222. 58 P. Marsden, Trans. London &amp; MiddleseR Arch. Soc. xxvi (I975), 83, No. 52. 9 M. H. Callender, Roman Amphorae (1965), No. 1370 (3a). 60 P. Marsden, op. cit. (note 58), 8o, No. 12.</page><page sequence="53">THE FORUM OF ROMAN LONDON 1968-9 53 bead-rim cooking-pots (Nos. 42 and 88), flanged-rim jars (Nos. 6 and 57), two flagons, one with a flanged rim (No. 59) and the other with a flaring flanged rim (No. 83), a dish with a reeded flanged rim (No. i8), a possible amphora (No. I I), a mortarium (No. 13), a poppy-head beaker (No. 8I), and a platter imitating Gallo-Belgic ware (No. 14). A Gallo-Belgic butt beaker (No. i) is very similar to Camulodunum form I13 where the type was probably manufactured from the pre-Conquest period until the Boudiccan destruction; and a large jug (No. 63) is paralleled by Camulodunum form 173 (especi- ally fig. 52, No. 12) where it is found from Claudian times. The only imported object in this group is a terra nigra cup (No. 20). Group E: shell-loaded ware Only one example, a bead-rimmed jar (No. 52) falls in this group, and it is charac- terised by a coarse ware which has fragments of shell added as temper. Vessels of this fabric are more common outside London, for example in Kent;61 the use of hard 'Romanized' wares predominates in London. From Period I deposit (ER 2030) (FIG. 17) I.
