<plain_text><page sequence="1">MLR, 9I.2, I996 follow more easily the development of his relationships with different corre- spondents. The eighteen correspondents include the linguist and literary historian Ia. K. Grot (2I letters), the writer Ol'ga Novikova (46 letters), A. F. Gil'ferding and F. I. Buslaev (one letter each), I. I. Sreznevskii (3 letters), and A. S. Suvorin, who had invited Ralston to write a regular piece on England for Novoe vremia, and to whom Ralston replied in September 1888 in very tolerable Russian, offering three possible topics: the learning of Russian in England, recent English novels, or the Whitechapel murders (p. 237). From the point of view of Ralston's own biography the most interesting are the fifty-three letters to Onegin, to whom alone he revealed his personal feelings. The last letter to Onegin, written shortly before his death, ends with the words: 'The fact is I can see no certainty anywhere. All is vague and dark and gloomy' (p. 316). Ralston's connection with Oxford was continued by Alekseev, who in 1963 delivered an Ilchester Lecture at the Taylorian Institution entitled 'William Ralston and Russian Writers of the Later Nineteenth Century'. Not only was the lecture an important ingredient of the present book but also the Ilchester Fund made a generous subsidy towards its production, possibly a unique instance of Western support for a Russian scholarly publication, and one which is equally generously acknowledged in the editor's preface. This preface also notes that Oxford University conferred D. Litt. degrees on both Alekseev (1963) and Levin (1988). One might add that Iurii Levin is a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and a past President of the MHRA, while Ralston's own work was recognized in his election in 1885 as Corresponding Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. It must have been difficult assembling all the information about Ralston and his British contacts without direct access to British libraries. In one footnote, for example, the authors mention that Leslie Stephen, whom Ralston lists among guests at a dinner he gave in Turgenev's honour in 188 , was the founder of the Dictionary of National Biography (p. I90). It would have been interesting for the Russian reader if they had also pointed out that Stephen was the father of Virginia Woolf. There are occasional such omissions, and a few errors in the English text of Ralston's letters, due probably to a combination of the difficulty of reading Ralston's hand and an imperfect knowledge of English on the part of either the biographers or the proofreader. Otherwise the book is scrupulous. The authors have flown the flag of Anglo-Russian literary relations under difficult circumstances, and they write with respect and affection about a man who did the same a century earlier. UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS ANTHONY HIPPISLEY Chekhov: A Life in Letters. Trans. and ed. by GORDON McVAY. London: The Folio Society. I994. xx+378 pp. ?25.95. This is not another collection of Chekhov's letters, but rather an anthology of excerpts from a large number of them, presented in chronological order. These new translations have been carefully and reliably researched and edited. A thirteen-page introduction gives the basic biographical facts, with comments on Chekhov's 'elusive' personality and the insoluble question of his attitude to religion, and an overview of critical attitudes expressed in English-language publications. The problem of selection or, rather, of what to leave out, is a particularly formidable one in the case of Chekhov, who wrote over 4,500 letters. The great merit of this compilation is that we are tapping into a vast number of his letters and a far greater continuum is achieved than is possible in single-volume collections of complete or near-complete letters, such as Karlinsky and Heim's Anton Chekhov's Life 535</page><page sequence="2">and Thought: Selected Letters and Commentary (Berkeley: University of California Press, I973) and Yarmolinsky's Letters ofAnton Chekhov (New York: Viking, 1973). On the other hand, many of the extracts offered here are very brief, sometimes no more than half a line, followed by a longish explanatory note, which it is generally -essential to consult and which runs counter to the stated purpose, 'to allow Chekhov himself to speak with a minimum of interruption' (p. xxii). Some pithy snatches are, however, very effective: for example, 'Your character is like a sour gooseberry...' (to Lika Mizinova (p. 127)), and particularly when juxtaposed: 'In Paris I saw naked women. . .' 'I owe you [Surovin] at least 800 roubles. . .' (p. Io8); 'I'm leading the life of a well-fed, idle, bored vagabond. . .' -'I have become grey and thin' (p. 336). Those taken from Chekhov's last year make particularly poignant reading, bringing out his utter loneliness, his vain hopes for Ol'ga to be with him, and his unfulfilled longing to have children. The biographical and thematic range is both wide and varied: Chekhov's views on ethical, social, and humanitarian matters, his chronic financial problems, his generosity in funding schools, and his gifts to the Taganrog public library, his ideas on the staging of his plays. There are generous extracts from his strongly-worded admonitions to his brother Aleksandr, his letters to Gor'kii, and the long and regular reports from his journey to Sakhalin. His flirtatious correspondence with Lika Mizinova and other women is well represented, but we also get glimpses of his latent misogyny. If anything, this compilation is a little short on Chekhov's humour, although we get some of his quirky phrasing ('Squelch, my stockings blow their noses' (p. 93)), while, for all its tragic importance, rather too much space is devoted to the unrelenting deterioration of Chekhov's health, his haemorrhoids being mentioned no fewer than nineteen times. The style of the letters is natural and flexible, devoid of flamboyance or rhetoric. Where Karlinsky and Heim aimed at a modern (and generally very successful) American idiom, Gordon McVay's translations are equally natural and acceptable British-English versions. Occasionally they are marred by the use of obsolescent slang. 'My health is up the spout' (p. 8); 'Otherwise I've had it' (p. 154); 'bored and browned off' (p. 88). 'Ia boius' ego [P. A. Sergeenko], eto pogrebal'nye drogi, postavlennye vertikal'no'is implausibly rendered as 'He gives me the creeps- he's a hearse on two legs' (p. 200). Infelicitous renderings include 'the [River] Psel is broad-shouldered ['shirok'] and majestic, like a general's coachman' (p. 79), which exaggerates and distorts Chekhov's anthropomorphic image, and 'indigent consumptives' which strikes the wrong note for 'chakhotochnye bedniaki' (p. 244). Interference from the Russian is evident in 'the high level of development' (of educated peasants (p. 55)), 'emerged from the people' (p. 232), and 'In general, do you have any books?' (p. 307). 'Marshal of the nobbled' is a puzzling rendering of the facetious signature 'Marshal dvorniazhek' (p. I o). McVay repeatedly falls into the familiar trap of rendering 'skuchno', 'skuka', and their cognates as 'boring', 'I'm bored', 'boredom', thereby not doing justice to the many shades of meaning of the Russian. 'Mne skuchno bez tebia' is best rendered as 'I miss you', not as 'it's boring without you' (p. 294). In the famous 'confessional' letter to Suvorin (7 January I889) 'khodivshii po urokam bez kalosh' does not mean 'going to his lessons without galoshes' (p. 70), but 'going to give his lessons [... ]': that is, tutoring children of the rich. The prefixpo- on comparative adverbs is not always restrictive ('a little more', 'a little better'), but can virtually mean the opposite, as in 'zhelaiu [... ] pobol'she liubvi, kotoraia prodolzhalas' by podol'she, etak let I5', which, as so often, Constance Garnett had got right: 'I wish you [...] more love, and that it may last a long time, say fifteen years' (The Letters of Anton Pavlovitch Tchehov to Olga Knipper (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1926), p. 68). McVay's 536 Reviews</page><page sequence="3">MLR, 91.2, I996 rendering is on page 266. A major problem is presented by Chekhov's quaint terms of endearment, mainly in letters to Ol'ga Leonardovna Knipper after their marriage in I90I. Especially baffling are the canine ones: 'sobaka', 'sobachka', 'pesik', where English is surprisingly short on equivalents: 'you, you dog' (p. 268) is too aggressive a rendering of'sobaka ty etakaia'. Affectionate coinages like 'aktrisulia' defy translation (Yarmolinsky's 'actressette' is a brave, but unsuccessful attempt). Readers may have difficulties in identifying The Cornfield as the Petersburg periodical Niva or The Messenger as the Moscow newspaper Kur'er. The rendering of place-names is inconsistent: while one may deduce from the context that 'the Novodevichy' (p. 234) is a cemetery, Devich'e pole, Chekhov's temporary Moscow address, is unhelpfully given as 'Maiden's Field' (p. I78). Slightly jarring is the Soviet style of identifying his addressees, e.g. 'To A. S. Suvorin', 'To L. S. Mizinova', 'To V. K. Kharkeevich' (fem.). Even his wife doesn't escape this treatment: 'To 0. L. Knipper-Chekhova'. The level of information offered in the notes is somewhat uneven. Most readers will know who Lermontov was (p. 267), how patronymics are formed (p. 315), but may not know 'land captain' (p. I 15), or that 'Ma-Pa' (p. I 19) is the writer's sister Mariia Pavlovna. Two consecutive notes inform us when and where Anton and Ol'ga became lovers (pp. 255, 256), while a note would have been welcome on the relevance for The Seagull of the killing of a woodcock (April I892). These strictures notwithstanding, this is a fine, imaginative, and very readable collection that provides many fresh insights into Chekhov's life and thought. Reading it has prompted the heretical thought that contrary to critical dogma, Chekhov was anything but averse to writing about himself. The publishers are to be warmly congratulated on including this volume in their distinguished series. UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW PETER HENRY Theatre as Action: Soviet Russian Avant-Garde Aesthetics. By LARS KLEBERG. London: Macmillan. 1993. xi+ 152 pp. ?I I.99. Scholars who view Soviet avant-garde theatre of the I920s as a seedbed for the trans-national modernist project try to negotiate carefully between critical appreci- ations of seminal artists and collectives and theorizing about the era as a political and cultural construct. Lars Kleberg's study modestly and selectively attempts to encapsulate a theatre aesthetic for this explosive decade by adhering to a tripartite functional model with very basic semiotic underpinnings and to one general assumption whose spirit informs the entire work. The latter concerns the question of whether the theatre audience in this period of culture-building really was or was only thought to be homogeneous, the 'myth' that the audience was somehow representative of the collective as a whole. The new order propounded a collective ideal but engaged in elitist practices that were, in a sense, predetermined by the manner in which the I9I7 revolution was made. The new theatre's decision to assume a Proletkultist or a general leftist profile would reflect the ways and degree to which pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary culture were to be linked in the popular imagination. Kleberg's discussion of'the myth of the representative auditorium' owes much to his previous published research, drawing upon the questionnaires administered by selected theatres (including Meierkhol'd's) to ascertain who precisely was in the auditorium, what they saw and what they wanted to see. Kleberg tracks the Soviet spectator through his early stages of development as 'a sentient subject' (Natural- ism's position), 'a controlled object' (the position derived from the theatre of 537</page></plain_text>
