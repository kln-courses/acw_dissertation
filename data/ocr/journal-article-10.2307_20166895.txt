<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes and comments African objects and the idea of fetish WYATT MacGAFFEY William Pietz has written a series of provocative and wide-ranging articles on the origin of the idea of fetishism and the role of that idea in European social thought, particularly in the last century (Pietz 1985, 1987, 1988, 1991). Currently we are ashamed to apply nineteenth-century labels and explanations to African culture without some attempt at modification, but in some areas we have not really developed any strong substitutes. In an attempt to move in that direction, this article makes use of the outline of Pietz's argument as a framework for describing some aspects of the religion of the BaKongo of western Zaire.1 Fetish Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, "fetish," an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, which as he says "originated in the cross cultural spaces of the coast of West Africa during the 16th and 17th centuries" (1985:5). In these cross cultural spaces Europeans were challenged to rethink the capacity of the material object to embody religious, commercial, aesthetic, and sexual values. What was originally a problem in understanding African culture became, in the work of such thinkers as Marx and Freud, a perspective, or group of perspectives, on European culture. Pietz says, "Fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two different types of non-capitalist society" (1985:7). The two types are European feudalism, with the Catholic theological tradition, and African societies. The third factor operating in the intercultural, coastal space was Dutch capitalism, which is closely related to Calvinist theology and the Protestant ethic. The components of "fetish" that emerged from the interaction of these three are identified by Pietz as follows: 1. The fetish is irreducibly material?unlike an idol, which represents an immaterial something located elsewhere. 2. The fetish is the fixation of a unique originating event that has brought together previously heterogeneous elements into a novel identity. Desires and beliefs and narrative structures are also fixed by the fetish, whose power is to repeat its originating act of rearticulating these heterogeneous elements. In this respect also, fetishism contrasts with idolatry, which was understood by European thinkers as a [rational] principle of social order; the fetish idea labeled a social order that seemed to have been generated paradoxically, by natural and lawless contingency. 3. Fetishism embodied the problem of the nonuniversality and social constructedness of value. Early travelers to West Africa were puzzled because gold was valued by West Africans and yet exchanged by them for articles that the Europeans considered worthless. 4. The material fetish as an object established an intense relation with, and exerted power over, the desires, actions, health, and self-identity of individuals whose personhood was conceived as inseparable from their bodies: the human body (as the material locus of action and desire) was subjected to the influence of amulets and the like that, although cut off from the body, functioned as its controlling organs at certain moments; for example, for healing. The alienness of African culture, in particular its resistance to rational trade relations, was explained (especially by Protestant traders) in terms of the African's supposed irrational propensity to personify material objects, which seemed to reveal a false understanding of natural causality. Africans also attributed causal relations to random association. They seemed to confuse the religious and the material, which Europeans had recently begun to think of as quite separate, and not to value properly material objects, such as gold. So it became conventional to describe Africans as worshipers of "trifles." The false religious 1. Most of the objects called "fetishes" in museums were collected between 1870 and 1920. In general, the past tense is used here to discuss them; the BaKongo no longer make the objects in similar forms, although the principles that generated them are still vital.</page><page sequence="2">124 RES 25 SPRING 1994 Figure 1.

The Dutch idea of African irrationality was turned into a full-fledged evolutionary theory by Enlightenment intellectuals and consecrated by Hegel. According to Hegel, Africans lacked the category of universality; they worshiped the first thing that came their way. Pietz says he is not concerned with the relation of the fetish idea to the actual conceptions of West African culture. Here, I will attempt to do the same thing, at least with respect to the ritual practice of the BaKongo, a people of western Zaire and northern Angola whom the Dutch knew relatively well, and for whose culture there exists a unique volume of indigenous documentation. What follows is a restatement of the elements of the fetish idea, and an examination of the extent to which they describe the kind of object the BaKongo call minkisi (fig. 1).2 1. The irreducible materiality of the nkisi: it does not represent an immaterial something, a spirit; located elsewhere. Two indigenous texts, dating from about 1915, describe certain spiritual entities and their material manifestations in the form of minkisi: Funza is like a man, but invisible. Also he is like a large pot in a well-made basket that has twisted driftwood in it and stones from the water, in which he placed his human body (Momo kakitudila lunitu Iwandi Iwa kimuntu). He lives in the water, but his servants have houses built for them in the same kind of grass in which the first couple is said to have built. These houses are placed at the end of the village, on account of looking after people who make sacrifices to them, which they take back to Funza, where he lives alone, so that he can oversee everybody. Sometimes he appears in dreams, telling someone "compose me." The person then sets up an nkisi to BUNZI or KIN KITA or MUTIN U, the three servants of Funza, sent by him to help man set limits to death sent by God, the eater of men.3 Cahier 138:7 Nkisi Mbola is called Mbola because it comes from "rotting" and it "rots" (bola) living things. Its origin is as follows. Once upon a time there was a man who lived to a very great age. He died and was buried in his grave. After his burial he lived for a long time in the land of the dead and grew old there. He died once again, but found himself no closer to his relatives there in the land of the dead, so he thought, What am I to do in this second death? I should become an nkisi. So he betook himself to a stream. When he got there he met a man crossing, so he began to bob about on the surface of the water. The man's eyes opened wide, he plucked a leaf and popped it three times on his hand [in salutation]. Then he took up [the thing he saw in the water], brought it to the village and put it in his house. Night fell, and the man went to sleep. [The ghost] then revealed his name to the man in his sleep, saying: I am one who formerly lived on earth and have died the second death; take me and keep me to be your nkisi. My name will be Mbola, because I rotted twice. You will make me a mpidi basket and a lukobe box, that I may live inside the box, but have a statue carved that I may be put in it. So he came with his sharp knives, his adze, his hatchet and his other tools. The actual procedure for constituting this nkisi Mbola includes the following: Then they go to the cemetery to wherever lies buried a man who was exceptionally strong and virile. They take him and put him in Mbola, they take earth from the grave and rub it on the statue. Then they return to the grave and sacrifice a chicken and drip [the blood] on the nkisi, singing: "Where the chicken died, may a man die, chop! the bracelets of the master nganga." After the invocation they install the spirits in the basket and the box, singing: "I took it, I put it. Eh yaya, I took it, I put it in the basket." Cahier 390 From such accounts it is clear that an nkisi was a spiritual entity, a personality from the land of the dead, present in a material body, by its own choice or otherwise, but not restricted to that body.4 The material object did not represent such a spiritual personality but provided a local habitation for it. Though some Kongo minkisi may always have been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less "realistic" before the mid nineteenth century, when European influence intensified. The celebrated naturalism of Kongo figures is much more marked in coastal areas than inland.5 2. Singular, nkisi; plural, minkisi. See MacGaffey and Harris 1993. 3. The texts identified as "Cahiers" were written by Kongo authors in their own language, KiKongo, between 1912 and 1916. The translations are my own. See MacGaffey 1986. 4. There is a close analogy between different minkisi of the same name and Christian shrines of the Virgin, each of which has its own identity, so that they are not substitutable; nor is the Virgin, who continues to reside in God's presence, bounded by any one shrine. 5. A nineteenth-century figure of Saint Anthony, evidently carved by an African, testifies to the influence of European models by its careful carving of the folds of the saint's robe (Beumers and Koloss 1992, fig. 59).</page><page sequence="4">126 RES 25 SPRING 1994 Although nkisi cannot be invoked except in its material form, Kongo theory is clearly inconsistent with the view that a fetish is irreducibly a material entity. Is it therefore an "idol"? A complicating factor is that Europeans tend to think of "spirits" as necessarily "objects of worship." The idea of an "idol," as understood by the Fathers of the Church, depended on a concept of "worship," a form of observance proper only to the true God, which became "idolatry" when addressed to false gods. A number of observers at the end of the last century, protesting against an idea of African culture that had already been found unsatisfactory in the sixteenth century, insisted that minkisi were not "worshiped" and thus were not "idols." One of them wrote that belief in charms (minkisi) was universal, but that no worship, prayer, or adulation was offered them. The keeper of a charm in its house might send for local youth to assist in his magical rites, "but so far from worshipping, the youngsters amuse themselves with laughing and dancing in front of the ?mage, occasionally pushing each other over in fun" (Phillips 1887:159). An nkisi violates our categories of the ritual and technical, spiritual and material, by being all of these; it is not approached in pious humility and may be abused and insulted to motivate it to perform appropriately. 2. The nkisi fixes previously heterogeneous elements into a novel identity. Desires and beliefs and narrative structures are also fixed by the nkisi. Europeans thought that Africans made fetishes of any trifles that happened to catch their eye. According to one of the principal informants of the widely read Dutch trader, William Bosman, an African about to undertake a project, and feeling the need of a sponsoring deity for it, would recognize as that deity "the first creature that presents itself to our Eyes, whether Dog, Cat, or the most contemptible animal in the world" (quoted in Pietz 1985:8). The resulting fetish thus recorded a unique originating event, as Pietz puts it, by combining into a novel identity previously heterogeneous elements, including not only its material ingredients but the desires and beliefs associated with the project. Africans were thus paradoxically supposed to generate a social order out of "a chaotic principle of contingency" (Pietz 1985:7-8). The contents of nkisi Nkita Nsumbu (fig. 1) might seem to confirm Bosman's view. It is easy to show that in fact very little in Kongo ritual is there by chance. It is true that the BaKongo might well emphasize the particularity of an nkisi and the singularity of its origin, but in their account they would reverse the direction of the originating impulse. The object that became an nkisi would likely have been presented to its intended owner on the initiative of the spirit personality that it represented, as in the case of both Mbola and the servants of Funza; minkisi were standardized objects that people adopted because they were obliged to do so. The processs of initiation by which minkisi were acquired might well be long and arduous. Secondly, it is also true that some ingredients were included in the material composite of the nkisi simply because they were ornamental or remarkable to look at. Many minkisi, and the nganga himself who operated them, were dressed up theatrically to provoke astonishment, partly as a way to lend authority to the performance. Most of the components, however, so far from being random trifles, were included for specific reasons, some of which varied very little from one nkisi to another. One kind of ingredient, or "medicine" (bilongo), consisted of such things as grave dirt or kaolin from the abode of the dead under the water, to adduce the presence and power of the dead in the composite. A second category expressed the uses to which this power would be put in this particular nkisi, either metaphorically or by a play on words. Metaphors included such things as a snake's head for an nkisi to attack wrongdoers, or the sharp tools of Mbola with which the nkisi carved away the noses and fingers of its victims. Twisted roots expressed a sense of the original, creative power of Funza. Other bilongo were included because their names suggested abstract qualities desirable in the nkisi. Here for example is part of an indigenous list of such medicines: kala zima (charcoal), that it may "strike" (zima) all who are evilly disposed; tondo (a subterranean mushroom), that the spirits be praised (tondisa) and the healing process be effective (tonda mbote); nkandikila (a red kernel), to bar (kandika) the path by which witches, bad dreams, and spirits may come; luhezomo (fossil resin), that witches, malicious persons, and evil spirits of all kinds should flee, just as we flee the flash of lightning (mpezomo) in the sky. Cahier 298 Minkisi were thus composed according to rules both specific to any one nkisi and characteristic of the genre. The principles underlying the rules were those of metaphor and metonymy, which are basic to figures of</page><page sequence="5">MacGaffey: Notes and comments 127 speech and to ritual, the world over. The "materiality" of the composite is therefore ambiguous. The myth of origin of the nkisi Nkita Nsumbu The myths of origin of minkisi are similarly ambiguous, stories of a purported past and prescriptions for the present. A woman called Ndandi Mfuka was walking by the edge of the water when she was seized by nkita spirits [a variety of simbi] who took her into the pool, where she remained for nine Nsona days [nine four-day weeks]. On the tenth she emerged with two stones with which she had composed nkisi Nkita under the water. When she appeared in the village she was covered with spots of red camwood. She remained in an enclosure for another Nsona day. On the next, she came out of it, knowing many things about the places under the earth and under the water where the bankita live. That day, she was asked many questions, but answered all of them, forgetting none, and explaining everything.6 This story of the origin of an nkisi, which might once have been read as a report of a random encounter with a "trifle," can now be seen as a narrative of an initiation sequence. To become qualified as the operator of this nkisi, the candidate is secluded for a period of time, during which she is supposedly being taught how to compose the nkisi in the land of spirits. Elements of regularity in the story include the banality of the event, which recurs as a trope very widely in West and Central Africa; the red spots, presupposing a color code, which indicate a liminal condition, partly in this world and partly in the world of spirits; and the cosmological setting, in which powers related to "the above" and to celestial waters are associated, as in Mbola, with men's concerns, with the upper part of the body, and with violence, whereas those "of below" and terrestrial waters are associated, as in Nkita Nsumbu, with women's concerns, healing, and the loins. What the nkisi records is not the mythical encounter of a particular woman with a materialized spiritual entity but local understanding of a disease, or group of diseases, which the nkisi was believed to control. In the myths of origin, "Whatever order emerges is not erroneous history, or the history of humans forgotten, but the resolution of human and cosmic dilemmas through analogy and metaphor, by transference to parallel domains" (Janzen 1982:304). 3. The fetish embodied the problem of the nonuniversality of value. Just as European traders in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries deemed the socioreligious orders of African societies to be founded on the valuing of trifles and trash, so also they remarked constantly on the fact that they could trade their own trinkets for objects of real value (Pietz 1985:9). Pietz says, "The discourse of the fetish has always been a critical discourse about the false objective values of a culture from which the speaker is personally distanced" (Pietz 1985:14). He goes on to say that in the intercultural space that is the home of fetish, Africans too, and specifically the BaKongo, took certain objects to be minkisi of the Europeans. There is some truth to this assertion, though on the whole I doubt that nkisi as a conceptual category is illuminated by it. Here are two examples from contemporary Zaire. The construction of bridges in difficult terrain proved impossible in the 1950s until, according to local belief, the territorial spirits (bisimbi) of the locality were captured by the European engineers and their powers controlled in bottles, the equivalent of nkisi containers. Surgeons are believed sometimes to make victims of their patients, stealing parts of their bodies to be the power sources for minkisi made up in what are, in fact, specimen jars.7 In these examples, Kongo interpretation of their experience led them to suppose that Europeans, inhabitants of the "other world"?the land of the dead?fabricated their minkisi by incorporating in them spirits from their own "other world," that is, the land of black people. On the whole, however, the equivalent African "discourse" functionally parallel to fetish in the intercultural space is probably not nkisi as such but African Christianity as developed in the independent churches. It can be argued that the leaders of these churches were, among other things, intellectuals who formulated answers to popular questions about the nature and meaning of Europe in its relation to Africa (MacGaffey 1983; 1984). 6.

Fetish, though separate from the body, functioned at times as though it were a controlling organ. From economics to psychology. The fourth theme found in the idea of the fetish is, then, that of the subjection of the human body (as the material locus of action and desire) to the influence of certain significant material objects that, although cut off from the body, function as its controlling organs at certain moments. It was, of course, psychoanalysis that developed most fully this theme of the effective symbol ization of the sexual human body "fixated" in relation to certain material things. Pietz 1985:10 The repertoire of minkisi known in any locality was a handbook of current problems, whose etiology it explained, together with courses of action intended as remedies. As new problems arose, including not only new diseases but, for example, the problem of European interference with local commerce in the 1880s, new minkisi emerged to deal with them (MacGaffey 1987). In many minkisi the beneficiary of the procedure would be given a sample of the medicines made up in a portable version of the nkisi itself, that is, as an amulet to be worn about the body, and others made up in a potion to be swallowed. By such means the nkisi and its particular powers would be incorporated in the person of the client, who would thereby be protected or cured. In addition to the metaphorical elements described above, certain kinds of nkisi themselves incorporated pieces of the client, such as his hair and nails, or of objects associated with him, such as a scrap of his clothing. Certainly, the material fetish as an object "established an intense relation with, and exerted power over, the desires, actions, health and self-identity of individuals whose personhood was conceived as inseparable from their bodies" (as in the medical practice of the modern United States, we might add). To regard the nkisi as simply an expression or projection of personal desires and passions is, I suggest, an explanation inadequate to the data, however much it may seem to save us from the embarrassments of "idolatry" and "fetishism." The passions, the rituals, and the material objects are clearly simultaneous in their production and use, and must be explained together rather than serially. The scandal of this sort of practice is the confusion it makes between the spiritual body of a human being and the profane materiality of things, between being the subject or the object of action. In the modern United States one of the worst things you can do, apparently, is to objectify someone. In fact, the distinctively European idea of the autonomous human individual entirely independent of material supports is realized only in extreme iconoclastic ideological forms, such as Quakerism and classical economics. In art, the aesthetic response depends largely on the identification of viewers with artworks; the Minimalist sculptor, Carl Andr? is quoted as saying, "Works of art are fetishes; that is, material objects of human production that we endow with extra-material powers" (Baker 1988:36). Baker comments, "The implicit analogy between works of art and their viewers had to be undone, in the Minimalist view, because the distinction between the animate and the inanimate, between active, responsible beings and inert ones, is an obvious first principle for an effort to see and think about the world clearly" (Baker 1988:138). The decline of Minimalism measures the failure of this ideal. In real life, despite the eighteenth-century rationalist credo, human beings are conscious of their identity in terms of relations with other people, mediated by material things that we only describe as fetishes if they happen not to be part of our own social practice and personae. All such objects?the child's stuffed animal, an engagement ring, a souvenir of a trip to Nepal?are potent because they embody self-defining experiences and relations with other people. As such, they acquire a sort of sacredness obliging us to treat them in exceptional ways, such as not discarding them when they cease to be useful. The public sacredness of national monuments is assured by legally enforced rules that not only oblige us to behave toward them much as one would behave in a temple but exclude them from ordinary commodification. The underlying principle that makes it possible for such objects to seem meaningful is not mistaken causality but, once again, that of metonymy. Like human beings, and like national monuments, shrines, and works of art, minkisi normally imposed restrictions on the behavior of people. In its original context, an nkisi was never the things it was made of, never just an object such as what we now find in museums of African art. Its power depended on the rules of alimentary and sexual avoidance that it imposed on its owner and on those who become its clients. If the rules were broken the nkisi was profaned (sumuka) and reverted to the status of object until it had been reconstituted. The nganga of Na Kongo may not eat a white chicken or a cock with other people, although he may share a hen, unless it also is white. He may not share anything white</page><page sequence="7">MacGaffey: Notes and comments 129 with uninitiated persons, even his own children, although if he loves the child very much and the child is very hungry he may take the chicken to the edge of the village and there put it down for a while; thereafter the taboo is suspended and he may eat with the child, though not with anyone else. Cahier 58 One who has been possessed by Nkita should not eat pork. After eating bananas he may not enter his house without first passing through the scent of luyangu-yangu flowers. These taboos stay in force all his life. Cahier 224 None of these rules of conduct constitutive of an nkisi are arbitrary. For example, the scented herb luyangu-yangu is used because it invokes the verb yangumuna, "to strengthen," with the intention that the heart of the devotee may be strengthened after a violation of the rules. The rules also had the sociological function of defining its owner's relations with others, sharpening the contrast between men and women, and between the initiated, who are powerful, and the uninitiated. Is nkisi a fetish? In what sense is a reading of minkisi possible within "the discourse of fetishism"? Marx ironically applied the term "fetish" to commodities in a capitalist economy, meaning that, in their apparent objectivity, commodities concealed real social relations among human beings. We might say that in noncapitalist economies this observation would not be news. In "gift economies" the value of an object often depends in part on the social relations it mediates. A famous example is that of the cattle-keeping Nilotic societies of southern Sudan, in which the history of the marriages and other transactions in which an animal has been transferred remains inscribed upon it, at least in the mind of its owner. In modern Kongo, a gift is withdrawn when the recipient violates the bond it established. The difference between an object (alienable) and a person (inalienable) is much less marked in such an economy than it is under capitalism, and the meaning of objects as signs of social relationships would seem to be more evident. In Kongo the different kinds of spirit, and the objects that actualize them, can be related to their sociological counterparts. When a descent group, conscious of its identity and its distinctive concerns, addresses itself to an abstract expression of that identity it thereby creates an ancestor. Likewise, local groups, which in Kongo are lineally heterogeneous, create by their ritual Statements an entity, a local spirit, called simbi, which represents their proper and collective local concerns, primarily those of production. In a third ritual complex, the clients or congregations of minkisi consist of people identified not by social locus, whether lineage or place of residence, but by specific problems?pneumonia, childbirth, hunting luck, difficulty passing exams, and the like; to each such problem corresponds one or more minkisi. The various spiritual entities in Kongo religion?ancestors, local spirits, and minkisi?are thus not random products of the imagination but specific reflections of human experience in a society organized in a particular way (MacGaffey 1977; 1986). The organization of Kongo society established the environment in which the securities and insecurities of personal experience were generated, and provided the possibilities of finding one's own place in it. A closer look suggests, however, that the seemingly transparent correspondence between rituals (and ritual objects) and the social morphology is misleading. Consider a particularly lucid account of the operation of nkisi Maniangu: If someone has had manioc or plantains stolen and is unable to discover what person or thief stole them, he cuts pieces of the manioc left by the thief and presents them to the nganga Maniangu that he may put them in the nkisi. This is called putting mfunya in the nkisi. When these tokens have been placed in the nkisi, it will afflict the one who stole the manioc with the disease of the ribs, lubanzi, or with bloody stools. Then those who are responsible for the sick person will seek the help of a diviner. When the diviner comes, he will say: "They have fixed tokens in Maniangu, and therefore the nkisi has seized him." So then the owner of the sick man will go to the nganga of Maniangu and tell him all that the diviner says he has seen in the spirit. Nganga Maniangu will remove the mfunya from his nkisi. After taking them out, he treats the patient. Treatment. The nganga collects leaves, crushes them and puts them in a pot, cuts up [the juicy vine] munkwisa, and puts that in the pot, adds water and heats it until it boils over. When it boils, he takes it off the fire, blows off the foam, and applies it to the body of the patient. Then he gives the rest of the mixture to the patient, saying: "Take the pot home, and drink a spoonful every day." The patient does this, and another day the nganga returns, makes him stand on the thatch of his house, and spits juice of munkwisa on his ribs while reciting: "Pfu! Raise him up, Lord Maniangu, the fault was committed, the fine was paid; pfu! raise up!"</page><page sequence="8">130 RES 25 SPRING 1994 When he has been treated like this, the patient may get better, but paying the nganga's fee will cause him a lot of pain. The cost of this nkisi is a pig and cloths worth 20 francs, or even much more if the nganga is fetched from far. At that price people generally think it is much too expensive. Cahier 15 Presumably, rituals did something to relieve the anxieties of people faced with disease, theft, or other problems. Belief in the possibility of being nailed by Maniangu and other retributive minkisi no doubt discouraged crime. It may well have been that the man who fell ill was indeed the thief, who intimated his fault to his family and indirectly to the diviner, but there can be no assurance of this connection and, therefore, we can have no confidence in functionalist explanations. There was theft, there were diseases, but the mere assumption or excuse of a connection among theft, disease, and a particular individual as wrongdoer ensured a flow of wealth from the vulnerable to those who had been able to invest in punitive devices. The most powerful minkisi were the most expensive, not only in initial outlay but in the periodic care and feeding they required; as investments, they were capable of generating impressive revenues (Schragg 1990:19). The political economy of minkisi is generalized by another Kongo writer: A magician wants things to be sacred so that his charm may be violated and he himself may receive money from the one who has broken the taboo. Such a person will fall ill, go to the magician, and pay the fine. If there were no taboo there would be no way to get money. The prohibitions of the chiefs are the same, but worse, since the violator can be accused and killed or fined by force, whereas one who breaks a magician's rules need do nothing unless he falls ill. Cahier 137 The predatory function of ritual in support of wealth and power is expressed in the composition of minkisi themselves: "When they compose an nkisi, they incorporate in it the spirit of some man who in his lifetime killed much game, owned much livestock and many slaves, one who was wily, wealthy, virile and successful in fighting other clans" (Cahier 65, describing nkisi Mbola). Minkisi were only one sector of Kongo religion, as we have already seen. All sectors, including those centered on descent groups and on local groups, operated in essentially the same way, with similar taboos and symbolism; the differences among them are sociological. Kongo religion, for which we have no convenient name, thus reveals the morphology of Kongo society while at the same time conceals its dynamics by mystification. In local theory, chiefs (heads of lineal groups) and ritual experts (operators of minkisi) defended the people against witches, thieves, wrongdoers, and members of hostile groups. This segmentary model partly concealed a form of inter group stratification in which the wealthy and powerful, using the beliefs and devices of ritual, cooperated to extract a continuous flow of wealth from the relatively poor. This kind of stratification corresponded, in a different mode of production, to class in capitalism, in that through ritual the dominant class controlled the conditions of social reproduction (Rey 1975). In its extreme forms, as seen in nineteenth-century coastal kingdoms, the Kongo population was stratified into nobles, free people, and slaves; as a way of generating slaves for the Atlantic trade, ritual traps were more common than simple capture (MacGaffey 1986:28-39). The ritual system as a whole thus bears a relationship to Kongo society similar to that which Marx supposed that "political economy" bore to capitalism as its "religion" (Pietz 1991), but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally "animate" character of the ritual system's symbolic apparatus, including minkisi, divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. "Fetishism" is about relations among people, rather than about the objects that mediate and disguise those relations. Ultimately, however, it may be that all this analysis does is to translate certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-Enlightenment Europe.</page><page sequence="9">MacGaffey: Notes and comments 131 BIBLIOGRAPHY Baker, K. 1988 Minimalism: Art of Circumstance, pp. 36, 138.
