<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mourning Becomes Melancholia--A Muse Deconstructed: Keats's Ode on Melancholy Anselm Haverkamp Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be Your mournful Psyche ...' REUD'S Beyond the Pleasure Principle, one is tempted to say, leads mourning beyond melancholia.* Such an outcome for "Mourn- ing and Melancholia," however, is less conclusive than the universal "beyond" may suggest. Mourning defies definition just as melancholia, its unworkable other, defies mourning.2 At a first glance, it looks as if, according to Freud, melancholia leads beyond mourn- ing, and it seems to be the pleasure principle that is left behind in melancholia rather than in mourning. At a second glance, then, there is a narcissistic relapse to be observed in melancholia that accounts for the inability to mourn. Melancholia, thus, would be the dead end of the pleasure principle, while the ability to mourn leads beyond in that it not only comes to terms with, but acknowledges that which remains inaccessible to those terms-the human condition of mortality. "Melancholy in this sense," we read in Burton's Anatomy of Mel- ancholy from 1621, "is the character of mortality."3 This character or imprint of mortality takes the place of the former character crucis, which was the imprint of baptism, and leaves the promise of an afterlife to the anatomy of dead letters. It foreshadows a beyond of other dimensions, the dimension of the "unconscious." Freud's distinction between mourning and melancholia, which describes the difference in terms of unconscious and conscious losses, conscious in the case of mourning, unconscious in the case of melancholia, *This paper was presented at several American universities in the spring of 1986. It is part of a larger project, "Mourning beyond Melancholia," two chapters of which have appeared under the title "Kryptische Subjektivitit-Archdiologie des Lyrisch- Individuellen," in Individualitdit, Poetik und Hermeneutik, 13, ed. Manfred Frank and Anselm Haverkamp (Munich, 1988), pp. 347-83. I am grateful to Perry Meisel for helping me with the final version of my English text.</page><page sequence="2">694 NEW LITERARY HISTORY still bears the mark of common sense, of "moderation" and "just reason," as Burton had required (II, 180). Within Freud's theory of the unconscious, this distinction represents a heuristic move rather than a systematic step in coming to terms with a certain pathological disposition, melancholia, as opposed to a certain normal behavior, mourning. The normality of this behavior is qualified by the un- derstanding of an evidently decisive loss, which causes grief; while the pathology of melancholia is above all characterized by an ap- parently causeless, and therefore incomprehensible, condition of de- pression. As "Mourning and Melancholia" proceeds, however, the pragmatics of the problem at hand are undermined and a more fundamental question is raised, which leads beyond mere adaptation to reality. In the case of loss, this adaptation is brought about by the "work of mourning," as Freud very pointedly calls it. Since life is haunted by losses and, as survival, is established on the premises of losses, the work of mourning turns out to be nothing less than the reality principle itself operative in the overcoming of losses. The phenomenology of mourning implied rather than overcome by Freud's distinction has been further developed by one of his closest readers, Benjamin, in his book on the Origin of German Tragic Drama, in his discussion of the "Trauerspiel," which literally translates as "play of mourning" instead of the "work of mourning." There is more to this casual opposition than meets the eye, since it is the melancholy constitution of the world rather than the successful adaptation to reality that provokes Benjamin's "theory of mourning": "Each sentiment, or mood, is directed towards, and depends upon, an a priori subject, the representation of which is its phenomenology. The theory of mourning . . . thus can only be developed in the description of the world [the "life-world," as phenomenologists would say; the "death-world," as Benjamin would rather have it] that reveals itself to the eye of the melancholy man."4 Melancholy, according to Benjamin, is the basic modern (baroque) disposition to which a theory of mourning has to conform, the basic "concept of (modern) reality," as Blumenberg has put it, a "Stim- mung" or "Gestimmtheit," as the more romantically minded "Jargon of Authenticity" has called it.5 Benjamin's theory of mourning, however, does not just give us another "regional" phenomenology of yet another mode of "being in time." The phenomenology of melancholy, as the very "subject" of Benjamin's theory of mourning, implies a temporality of its subject that, moreover, reflects the historicality of phenomenology. The phenomenology of melancholy, one could say, is caught within the melancholy of phenomenology- as Burton already knew. Thus, the origin of melancholy marks the</page><page sequence="3">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 695 origin of phenomenology; phenomenology is the result of and proper to the melancholy "eye." The historicality of this "episteme," to put it in terms of Foucault's "archaeology" of the same formation, is presupposed by Freud's distinction. Freud's distinction, consequently, turns from an anthropological, though "heuristical," fiction into a historical concept. Under the auspices of a theory of mourning, phenomenology reveals a historical "a priori," which is described by Benjamin as the melancholy condition of subjectivity in a modern world; the modern "I" as reflected by the melancholy "eye." Rather than going further into the metacritical problems of phe- nomenology and psychoanalysis, I shall elaborate the theory of mourning within the frame of a "historical phenomenology."6 As the fate of Burton's Anatomy shows, this project is by no means alien to literary studies but can be only based upon "criticism" in the strict sense. Frye, therefore, is able to translate the Anatomy of Melancholy into an Anatomy of Criticism, with the obvious implication that criticism performs upon texts anatomically, thereby presup- posing the death of its objects as well as the melancholy of the performing critic-the "mortification of the works," as Benjamin says.' Like Benjamin's book on the "Trauerspiel," Frye's "Anatomy" is a book about allegory as a "principle of structure," as the New Critics used to say;8 although one has to qualify this use of the term "structure," since Foucault's archaeology makes clear that the age of "similitudes" and "resemblances," of allegory, was, in fact, a prestructuralist age.9 What can be learned from Foucault's archae- ology of structuralism is, above all, that the preceding "episteme" organized knowledge allegorically, according to the resemblance of "four similitudes." Allegory not only becomes the critical equivalent of literary structure, but was "structure" in the prestructural age, and was "representation" before scientific representation came about in the Age of Reason. The metaphor "anatomy" indicates the new prevalence of analytical operations, of criticism in the new sense, over the older techniques of allegorical commentaries. An anatomy of criticism thus turns out to be an anatomy of allegory in the postallegorical episteme of representation. What can be learned from Benjamin's phenomenology of melancholy is, on the other hand, that the allegorical structure of texts, analyzed structurally, that is, "anatomically," presupposes the end of that allegorical age of re- semblance and the impertinence of the similitudes. Reading the new way, that is, "critically," now means a structural procedure which turns melancholy in that it "mortifies" its objects and consequently perceives them as dead "texture." Reading is melancholy in its "perception" of a materiality of texts, in the contemplation of the</page><page sequence="4">696 NEW LITERARY HISTORY dead letter, as there is, in the words of one of Benjamin's baroque sources, "nothing more mournful than books" (I, 320). According to Benjamin, the theory of mourning implies a theory of reading as the mournful perception of the world; as in de Man, who more and more closely read Benjamin, the theory of reading becomes a theory of mourning-of "unreadability," and the im- possibility of mourning, melancholia. The question is less how much mourning is done in reading than how much reading is needed in mourning. Mourning becomes the term for what reading might be all about: a coming to terms with what is on the page, as what is (left) on the page was a coming to terms with what was not on the page before. The "error in mourning" that separates melancholia from "true mourning" would be an error in coming to terms with what is on the page by overleaping the fact that it is on the page only.'o The impossibility of mourning, consequently, becomes the exemplary instance of the unreadability of writing. The paradigmatic case I would like to investigate here needs no lengthy introduction, though it does perhaps need a methodological warning that no thematic approach is intended. That Keats's "Ode" is "On Melancholy" does not suffice to make it a preferable or exemplary instance of the history of "mourning and melancholia." The history of "grief and mourning" that has been recently elu- cidated with respect to the "English Renaissance Elegy" is a good example of the impasses common to histories of ideas in the field of psychohistory, that is, the confusion of thematic and formalist approaches to which this topic is highly susceptible." Certainly, the history of the associated commonplaces (topoi) of grief and conso- lation as well as the generic features of the elegy as the very genre of mourning are of the greatest interest for the hermeneutical frames of "understanding" mourning in or by poems.'2 Conse- quently, the paradoxical outcome of a historical survey along those lines shows a growing lack of understanding, a "repression" almost of mourning in texts on mourning-a coming to terms on the page, that is, where there was no coming to terms for texts, an impossibility of mourning that had to be compensated for by consolation. Stanley Fish's reading of "Lycidas," "A Poem Finally Anonymous," tries to make a virtue out of this impasse. The breaking of form, of the generic unity of the elegy as the genre of both mourning and consolation, becomes manifest in "Lycidas," when the speaker says to the apostrophized berries, "I am sorry to have to do this to you"; and what he is even sorrier about is that "something . . . has been done to him," as Fish aptly points out: what is left to him, in other words, "What he can do, and very effectively, is to . . . disassociate</page><page sequence="5">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 697 himself from the [poetic] failures he continues to expose [in this poem].""' The withdrawal of the poet into final anonymity, however, leaves the poem finally unconsoled.'4 It approaches, in the under- standing of Freud's phenomenological critics (from Benjamin to Derrida), the "impossibility of mourning." Keats, whose "Ode" draws heavily upon both Burton and "Lycidas," represents something like the final instance of the same stage in the (pre-)history of "mourning and melancholia," though certainly not in the figure of the "romantic hero" that Milton's lyrical voice could not, and Keats's voice would not be. A "nearly anonymous" voice turns against the muse that cannot be silenced but can be named, exposed, and imprisoned in the poem, "Melancholy." It is in Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding that we find a hunch, a first idea of Freud's distinction, in one of the supple- mentary examples he added to the fourth edition of 1701. There he lists, under the heading of "wrong connexion of ideas," cases of "incurable sorrow": The death of a child that was the daily delight of its mother's eyes, and a joy of her soul, rends from her heart the whole comfort of her life, and gives her all the torment imaginable. . . . Till time has by disuse separated the sense of that enjoyment and its loss, from the idea of the child returning to her memory, all representations, though ever so reasonable, are in vain; and therefore some in whom the union between these ideas is never dissolved, spend their lives in mourning, and carry an incurable sorrow to their graves.'5 What Locke calls "an incurable sorrow," and what Freud came to distinguish as melancholy from mourning, stems from an inability to "dissolve" a wrong connection of ideas, for example the mother's outdated expectation, which keeps "the child returning to her mem- ory." It is memory that accounts for melancholia, according to Locke, through a misled memory of an outdated association of ideas. Consequently, H lderlin's account of an "error in mourning" reports the death of Mnemosyne (memory) while Keats's "Ode" begins with an ostentatious turning away from Lethe ("forgetting"): "No, no, go not to Lethe . . ." (1. 1). Burton's Anatomy, which is one of the sources, or intertexts, of Keats's first stanza, not with respect to Lethe but to the enumerated causes of suicide which lead to Lethe, and to drugs leading to forgetting, had mentioned among the causes of melancholy "Death of friends, Losses, &amp;c.," but without obviously getting near the point Locke at least approaches and "associates." "In the labyrinth of accidental causes," Burton thinks, "loss and death of friends may challenge a first place." This cause appears to him as merely "ac-</page><page sequence="6">698 NEW LITERARY HISTORY cidental," since its melancholy effect appears arbitrary-an effect that is very painfully described in a large variety of cases: "still, still, still, that good father, that good son, that good wife, that dear friend runs in their minds; ... all the year long, as Pliny complains to Romanus, Methinks I see Virginius, I hear Virginius, I talk to Virginius, &amp;c." (I, 357-58). The description is pertinent in that it faithfully represents the repetitive force within melancholia, but the underlying mechanism appears to be both evident and mysterious at the same time. The cause in this case explains nothing, remains apparently accidental in that it triggers a behavior which cannot be simply reduced to this cause, because it reproduces the cause that produces it and thus appears to be causeless, like the "melancholy fit," which foreshadows what later came to be known in Baudelaire as "spleen." Burton, as it seems, well describes what we more easily identify as an "error in mourning," but he shows it rather than explains it, and, while showing rather than explaining it, does so very effectively. Locke already approximates the theoretically manifest distinction of Freud, though we have to be very careful not to overread him; his associationist psychology does not anticipate psychoanalysis but rather heightens its explanatory effects. The ability to "dissolve," as Locke has it, is obviously not synonymous with "repression" where nothing is dissolved but where the unresolved remains active. Thus we can read Locke as a theoretical "rationalization" of Burton's description, but not as an explanation for what is at stake in Holderlin, Keats, or Baudelaire. They, however, presuppose the topicality of enlightened commonplace psychology. Freud, on the other hand, relates to romanticism as Locke to Burton, though one would have to qualify the differences of these relations considerably.'16 Keats, finally, as H61derlin before him, marks the "threshold" to be crossed. Technically speaking, this crossing over reveals its antici- patory quality in the way it relates to, and comes to terms with, the poetical tradition it leaves behind, although not without recalling it once more "intertextually." Coming to terms, thus, proves to be a coming to tropes with what had already been tropes before, a "retroping" of already existing allegories as poetical failures of representations. There is a new kind of intertextuality to be observed, which "makes a difference," a difference in terms of "mourning and melancholia." The transtextual references in Keats's "Ode" are easy to identify, perhaps too easy. The first stanza recalls Burton's Anatomy and in doing so resumes Milton's refutation in "Lycidas" of the elegiac</page><page sequence="7">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 699 mode of consolation--at the same time, however, alluding to the first elegy of Ovid's Tristia. I quote from a late nineteenth-century translation which keeps prosaically to its seventeenth-century model, Saltonstall's Tristia (the addressee being the book sent home by Ovid as the witness of his fate): Let not the hyacinth array you in its purple tints; . . . Let not your title be inscribed in vermilion, nor let your leaves be prepared with the oil of the cedar; and do not wear whitened extremities [ends, or tops, that is, "covers"] with a blackened page. Let these appliances be the ornaments of more fortunate books: it benefits you to keep your fate in remembrance. And let not the two sides of your leaves be polished . . . And be not ashamed of your blots: he who beholds them will be sensible that they were caused by my tears." Habent sua fata libelli, but the fate of this one is to give evidence of the fate of its author, to represent his melancholy over the loss of his country (the nostalgia for heaven, according to the allegorical interpretatio christiana), as Keats's poem re-presents, that is quotes the melancholia of a tradition that failed in representing what its allegorical promise was all about, and failed in coming to terms, in terms of consolation, with this loss as well. Summing up this loss in the representation of its associated hopes, Keats applies Burton's anatomy and produces a texture that distances structurally what had been substantially at stake. This "texture," according to New Critical procedures, is submitted to a rational "argument," the logic of which borders on parody.'8 Irony surfaces in places of grammatical impertinence, semantical inconsistencies, "ambiguity," as Empson has called it.'9 I follow his advice and come to the following first reading of the ode. The dramatically "staged" warning, enumerating Burton's com- monplaces, hides an urgent anxiety about suicide under the ironic surface of a parody. The ambiguity involved represents the same repetitive momentum as exemplified by Burton: "No, no, go not ... ," an anxiety not of influence, but of its opposite, forgetting: ". .. not to Lethe." It counteracts the suicidal tendencies of melancholy, and, taking countermeasures, makes the Ode to Melancholy, as one would expect, into an Ode on Melancholy: Melancholy is not addressed but dealt with, and the antidote in dealing with melancholy, as invented in romanticism, is irony.20 It is a rather shaky irony, though, but effective enough to wrest from the second stanza the temporary pleasure of an apparently natural setting, as opposed to the seemingly mythical setting of the first stanza. The "dialectics" of both brings</page><page sequence="8">700 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the initial warning to a final exhortation, we read in a good many "paraphrases" of the poem's argument: it is, in the commentary by Miriam Allott, "a characteristic Keatsian statement about the necessary relationship between joy and sorrow. True melancholy," the summary goes on, is "felt only"-that is, "experienced" in the true sense-in the dialectics of both, joy and sorrow.21 The "Temple of Delight," consequently, is seen as a late locus amoenus of the romantic quest, where the coincidence of joy and sorrow is worshipped, not sorrow cured.22 What sets the ode apart from this pattern, however, is the am- bivalent irony, the carefully preserved detachment from experience, which make it an almost experimental device. It is the "melancholy fit" only, the manic opposite of the preceding depression, that is ironically exposed; the splenetic rather than serene outcome which "projects" its own raving desire onto the desired beloved-a pro- jection that is almost the opposite of "empathic" experience. Just as Burton's descriptive phenomenology served as a pretext for an all-too-ambivalent irony to overcome depression, this very depression now--in a reaction-formation against mere phenomenology - serves as pretext for an almost manic acting out of a perverted desire: "if thy mistress some rich anger shows, / Imprison her soft hand, and let her rave" (11. 18-19). What makes her eyes "peerless" is not their glance looking back, but their value as an "introject"--how they mirror back, reflect, the projected, narcissistic "I." This "mediation" of the two extremes of pathological melancholia (mania and de- pression) leads in Keats's third stanza into a petrifying allegorization of the avoided addressee of the ode, Melancholy, which turns from the formerly addressed muse into an abstraction beyond the means of apostrophe. As we know from Freud's account of melancholia, abstractions like this one always stand for a loss, a loss that in this case the muse is unable to account for. The irony of allusion, though, had managed to quote the lost: "She dwells with Beauty" (1. 21) obviously parodies Byron's "She walks in beauty"; "Beauty that must die" (1. 21) as Keats continues, while Byron calls her "like the night," and we learn later that she "appeared in mourning, with dark spangles on her dress."23 The grammatical subject of Keats's sentence, however, which seemed to refer to the object of the preceding stanza, the mistress of perverted desire, turns out to be the objectifying instance, the goddess Mel- ancholy herself. This allegorical result of the poem is amplified by another quotation taken from the mouth of another poet, "his poet" for Keats, Shakespeare (by way of Horace).24 In his Sonnet 31 we find the following apostrophe, not only to the subject, the "young man," but at the same time to the "vehicle," the poem itself: "Thou</page><page sequence="9">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 701 art the grave where buried love doth live, / Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone."25 The result of the consummation of love, the using up of the beloved within the abuse of melancholy ("feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes," 1. 20) makes the poet himself a "trophy," cloudy like the spleen (the "weeping cloud," 1. 12). "His soul" (a "death- moth" rather than "Psyche's" butterfly) turns into one of Melancholy's "trophies hung," just as the addressee appeared in Shakespeare's sonnet as the "grave" for the poet's "lovers gone." The difference is decisive and deserves a closer look; its differentiating momentum not only re-tropes but de-tropes Shakespeare's "image." The mel- ancholy poet consciously digs his own grave, or, rather, in writing it he tries to escape it; and in not addressing it properly, as the genre and the model of Shakespeare would have required, he holds back, pretending, in fact, to be someone else, shifting from "feed deep" to "His soul" in an ironic splitting of his lyrical voice. No lyrical "I" is left, only a lyrical "eye" observing itself as an other on whom to blame the consequential "shall," the future "trophy," the poem that is left on the page and came to terms with what remains now inaccessible, the poet "saved from drowning" (as Barthelme put it) in "the wakeful anguish of the soul" (1. 10).26 This first, preliminary, reading, drawn from Empson's short but far reaching remarks, is still rendered in a paraphrase and thus is guilty of the "heresy of paraphrase"; it has to be rephrased in a "second," more structural, reading. The paraphrase still does, at least attempts to, "understand" the poem; it follows, not without close attention to its texture, the logical argument established in the text: "Go not to Lethe" (whatever this means, drugs or suicide), but "when the melancholy fit shall fall" (1. 11), make the best of it, though it's not the best; "imprison," though you'll be the prisoner, and the imprisoned object of desire shall make you the subject matter of your own disposition (as Shakespeare had, in a memorable way, symbolized the narcissistic constitution of the writing subjec- tivity). This understanding of the poem has now to be investigated according to its "condition of possibility," that is, in the paradoxical case of melancholia, according to the condition of the impossibility of mourning. "Irony" here is the means of coming to terms with melancholia, though the term we actually arrive at, irony, is by no means clear, and something like "mystic oxymoron" may seem more appropriate.27 What used to be and no longer is an "Ode to" has turned into an "Irony on." The application of irony to melancholy retropes, or refashions, another superimposition that was the work of melancholy on allegory; it does not deconstruct the work of melancholy, as</page><page sequence="10">702 NEW LITERARY HISTORY does, in fact, Keats's poem. The loss of eschatology, the collapse of the typological perspective of allegory, the destruction of its "schema" or "figura," results in and is prolonged by the melancholy described by Benjamin.28 The prohibition of a prolonged mourning, as mel- ancholy had been conceived of until the baroque, had turned into an inability to mourn in this life: "He that feares death, or mournes it, in the just, / Shows of the resurrection little trust," runs an orthodox epigram "Of Death" by Ben Jonson.29 Thus, the inabil- ity to mourn was supposed to prove faith in the promised afterlife, as well as to show the same within this life. Melancholy petrifies this attitude of an outdated allegorical "order of things" into what de Man calls an "anthropomorphism" of the underlying trope, allegory.30 De Man supplements Benjamin's model of melancholy in that he analyzes the melancholy of allegory as an "anthropomorphism of trope." "Anthropomorphism," however, is a hermeneutical term, not a rhetorical one; as an instrument of enlightened critique of religion, in fact, it counteracts rather than supplements a certain precritical use of dogmatic rhetoric. It thus reflects very precisely the histor- icality of the problem it systematically investigates. In the Kantian tradition (including Nietzsche), anthropomorphism is a rhetorical fallacy, by which the allegorical potential of literature is frozen within the dogmatic frames of theology. Melancholy, one could say, is the allegorical name for the death of allegory. It allegorically "re- inscribes" Allegory on the dead face, the skull, of what had been allegory before (Benjamin). But it also gives a face to the lost object and presents a voice from beyond the grave. As a withdrawal symptom it manifests itself in an almost hallucinatory way. It testifies, finally, to the loss of hermeneutical control over the inherited allegorical frame of reference. "Irony," on the other hand, is yet another and, in fact, the older anthropomorphism of trope. Since Quintilian's double definition of irony as both trope and state of mind (Socrates being its personification), irony exemplifies paradig- matically the anthropomorphic condition of tropological discourse, or, more precisely, the anthropomorphic state of the tropological condition of discourse. It thematizes as well as criticizes; it disrupts as well as prolongs what is going on. The irony of Keats's ode thus not only thematizes but criticizes melancholy; it disrupts the genre of the ode as well as prolongs its writing. In the development of Keats's writing, it is the ode, and not the elegy, that proves to be the genre of mourning rather than consoling, whereas elegy seems to be absorbed by melancholy rather than the work of mourning. Earl Wasserman in his classic book on Keats's major poems de-</page><page sequence="11">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 703 scribed a similar conflict of interpretations (though not of "anthro- pomorphisms of trope"), a similar detachment from (or almost "deconstruction" of) what he plausibly called the "empathic partic- ipation in the life of the images" as established in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and destroyed by the "Ode to a Nightingale": "The thematic materials of the two odes, we shall see, are the same; but what blends organically in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' disintegrates in this ode; what is seen in its immortal aspects in the former is seen in its mortal aspects in the latter."''1 The "Ode on Melancholy," which does not make it into Wasserman's selection of major poems, performs a similar "disintegration" (Wasserman's term) on the "Ode to Psyche," which Wasserman admits he never "learned to read." Wasserman's intuitions supplement each other. The disintegration works in this pair of related poems in "autoreversal" to the one analyzed by him-in the reversal of an "Ode to" into an "Ode on." What counts here is the deconstructive power of the one text over the other, a mutual relation, moreover, in which one anthropo- morphism replaces the other to be self-deconstructed in this very replacement. Irony, in this case, does more, in that it establishes a permanent movement that postpones indefinitely while wittingly keeping alive the dangerous impact of the postponed. Irony, in overcoming melancholy, makes melancholy the anthropomorphism of trope that it used to be under the reign of a different "rhetoric of temporality." In Keats's "Ode on Melancholy," the address to an immortal soul, Psyche, is reduced to a meditation on its mortality, its limited availability, and final unreadability.2 What distinguishes this meditatio mortis is the doubt it casts upon the genre of consolation and its melancholy condition. This meditation comes into being only as the par-ody of the genre it meditates in its incapability; it has, as Keats pointedly names it, "negative capability." As far as the tradition thus destroyed is concerned, it is the very allusion to and resuming of the destroyed that construes a new, though very precarious "meaning"-a truly ambivalent outcome that makes the "Ode" truly an ode "On Melancholy." I restrict myself to the Shakespeare sonnet, which at the end of the ode is not just alluded to but played with. Keats resumes in these lines what Shakespeare presents in his sonnet: the "narcissistic" pose by which the poet reviews his poem as an assembly of lost loves, impersonated by the notorious "young man"; an assembly of "trophies" not of success but of failure, impersonated by the infamous addressee of the poem, the poem. Keats adds to these victims of the poet the poet himself as the victim of poetry, or rather, of the muse that melancholy became for poetry. Doubling the Shakespearean doubling</page><page sequence="12">704 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of the addressee of the poem by the poem itself, Keats doubles the subject of the poem, the poet, by what is subjected to it, the poet himself. Shakespeare's Sonnet 31, as his editor Stephen Booth points out, is "the second of two exempla for the homely proverb, 'In love is no lack.' "33 That is, it finally proves how his poem, the sonnet, is in lack of love, and how this lack of loving made it what it became through lacking: a "grave" with "trophies," haunted by "images"- that is, "ghosts in the machine" in both senses, the Cartesian sense as well as the "machine to think with," which is the poem.34 Keats thus manipulates the "tenor" of the "vehicle" at hand, provoking something like a "ghost dance." The "empathic participation" (Was- serman) they trigger in vain cuts the "lover" and his love into "parts," as Shakespeare says, and makes up the parts of the poem. For Shakespeare the poem presents the losses of love in the ghostly appearance of "images"; for Keats the same act of presentation is represented as melancholy and "reigned by melancholy." For Shake- speare the loss is overcome and "reigned" by poetry, for Keats this "mourning" remains untrue and consequently rejoices in melancholy. What was for Shakespeare the pretext of writing becomes the impossibility of the same writing for Keats, though an ironically and ambiguously joyful one ("Joy's grape," 1. 28), as it was for Shakespeare a sad one ("the sadness of her might," 1. 29).35 Keats identifies melancholy as the necessary implication and his- torical consequence of what one could judge, from his perspective, as the natural narcissism of Shakespeare's poetry. Read from his modern (romantic) and, as far as Freud is concerned, from a postromantic (postmodern) perspective, Shakespeare's text becomes the perfect exemplification of the melancholy constitution of "sub- jectivity," a subjectivity that is poetical in that it is self-productive-- in that it creates its self, and while creating itself as it-self, detaches itself from its self, thereby exposing the condition of its existence on the page and beyond the page. A fictive identity, as the poetic dimension on the page (as text), from now on becomes the model of the "subject" (our selves, our discipline).36 The psychoanalytic hypothesis of the narcissistic constitution of the subject on the model of introjected objects finds its early modern, "baroque" (in Benjamin's sense) point in poems like Shakespeare's Sonnet 31-though we were hardly able to read it that way without having read Keats before. Benjamin points out that the baroque melancholy eye presupposes, even entails, the death of the contem- plated object in order to save it eternally and thereby achieve salvation</page><page sequence="13">MOURNING BECOMES MELANCHOLIA 705 for the subject as well. As Keats's reading and retuning of Shake- speare's sonnet shows, the latter hope remains hopeless, and even the melancholy self-reflection of the fictive melancholy self, the self- exposing destruction of the poem, won't do either-except for another, "intensifying and prolonging" poem, one that Keats actually wrote, "To Autumn," not without having a distressing "Ode on Indolence" to go with it.37 Keats thus, until his imminent end, nourished the ambivalence at the bottom of his melancholia and followed, in a poetical "working through," the repetition compulsion of modern writing.

Adorno,Jargon der Eigentlichkeit-Zur deutschen Ideologie (Frankfurt, 1964), pp. 13, 66.
