<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION OF THE PHE NOMENA OF MEMORY AND SENSATION. ROM the earliest historical epochs to the present day, A philosophers have expended a considerable proportion of their energies in framing replies to the question whether mental phenomena are, or are not, capable of resolution into law; of material, that is, physical or chemical, inter pretation; of exact mathematical analysis. Not only phi losophers, but also men of science, and others addicted to metaphysical speculation, have added their quota to a dis cussion the age and inconclusiveness of which has suffi ciently demonstrated its sterility. As is customary in meta physical discussion, the answers which have been pro pounded to this question are as numerous as the philos ophers themselves. From the dualism which regards the mind as a species of "gaseous vertebrate" dwelling within but not, or only in a minor degree, subject to the physical and chemical laws which govern our material body, to the monism of Giordano Bruno which regards material objects as the "shadows of ideas," the mind the reality, matter the phantasm, and to the monism of Comte, which is the in verse of that of Giordano Bruno, every transition of opin ion can be found, every shade of formulation, every com promise, and every absurdity which ingenious imagination, untramelled by fact, can delude itself into believing. One by one the problems with which the metaphysicians have busied themselves in the past have been wrested from</page><page sequence="2">368 THE MONIST. their hands, and received into that domain over which fact and not hypothesis rules; the domain of science. And it was inevitable that this ancient question must ultimately also acknowledge the suzerainty of science, for it was one which experiment, and experiment alone, could decide. Those philosophers who postulated the superiority of mental phenomena over law, their freedom from the in variability of sequence and consequence which character izes material phenomena, and, consequently, their immu nity from exact formulation, measurement, and material interpretation, placed themselves in a position of consider able insecurity, for a single experimental proof of invaria bility of sequence and consequence in mental phenomena would set at nought their hypothesis and close the time worn discussion for ever; the outworks once stormed, the citadel of their belief was doomed. This is why the exact and laborious investigations of Weber and Ebbinghaus, and of scores who have succeeded them, have definitely an swered the question of the independence or interdependence of mind and matter and have placed science, once for all, in possession of the realm of mental phenomena?for these investigators have demonstrated that sensation and mem ory are capable of measurement and that they obey definite laws susceptible of mathematical formulation, and, there fore, of material interpretation. But belief dies hard, and conviction of the futility of any discussion is a product of slow and painful growth, and thus it happens that among a large group of writers and thinkers (comparatively few of them biologists, however), controversy still rages over the question whether mental phenomena will ever yield to the all-conquering methods of science, and the belief still holds sway in that last out post of primitive anthropomorphism, the "gaseous verte brate," immanent within, but independent of the material organism.</page><page sequence="3">MEMORY, SENSATION : BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION. 369 It is possible that for a definite closure of this discus sion, for the final annihilation of the naive anthropomor phism which holds humanity in thrall, we must look for ward to ages coeval with the realization of the celebrated "world formula" of Laplace. In order to be susceptible of scientific measurement, of comparison with standards, any quantity, whether it be a quantity of length, mass, heat or sensation, must be capable of being perceived directly or indirectly by the senses, and no mean portion of scientific advance consists in the opening up of new fields of research, and consequent knowledge, through the invention of new methods of bring ing objects before the senses, and thus artificially enhan cing their acuity. It is not sufficient, however, that the object to be meas ured should be capable of being brought before the senses of a single individual?it must be capable of being brought before the senses of universal humanity; the phenomena observed, and the quantities measured, must be capable of indefinite duplication and repetition; for the evidence of a single individual, however careful his investigation, how ever exact his methods, and however sincere he may be, is valueless from a scientific standpoint unless the data con stituting his evidence are obtainable by all. It is this pos sibility of indefinite reduplication which confers upon the data of science their certitude; for although "a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth," yet a plurality of evidences is a guarantee of probability?and the whole edifice of natural science is nothing other than a vast outgrowth from the science of probability ; in itself a group of inductions from universal experience. Now it is true that the phenomena of our mental life are, to each one of us, individually perceptible, but they certainly are not, as a rule, perceptible, at present, to uni versal humanity. The mental processes occurring in A</page><page sequence="4">370 THE MONIST. are certainly very real and perceptible to him but he can not, as a rule, measure them by any standards except his own, since those of are inaccessible to him. Imagine a piece of iron which is conscious only of its internal con dition and unable to compare it with external conditions, and suppose it were to try and measure its own length. It might do so by fixing upon an arbitrary portion of itself as the unit of length, and then perceiving that its total length was a certain multiple of this unit. Suppose, how ever, that at some subsequent period the temperature were to increase, and the piece of iron were to endeavor to repeat the measurement ; its length would have increased, because iron expands with heat. But since each particle of the iron undergoes expansion in the same proportion, the piece of iron would imagine itself unaltered in length, since its length would still be the same multiple of its arbitrary unit ; it would have no means of ascertaining that the length of its unit had increased, because it could not compare it with other, external units, which do not expand as the tempera ture rises. A human being is, as regards the mental phenomena which occur within him, very much in the position of this hypothetical piece of iron. He is at the same time the ob server and the observed, that which measures and that which is measured, and his conclusions from such internal measurements may possess an individual interest but are totally devoid of scientific value, unless the measurements are of such a type that they can be repeated by other ob servers external to himself ; can be referred, in a word, to external standards. But, the reader may inquire, how can the tenuous en tities of thought, sensation, or memory be compared with external standards and be made evident to the senses of universal humanity? How can the chasm which divides our internal, mental life from the external, material world</page><page sequence="5">MEMORY, SENSATION: BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION. 37I ever be bridged ? The answer is that this chasm is imag inary; an artefact arising from our peculiar situation of being at the same time the observer and that which is ob served; a delusion which, it is evident, must be the inevi table result of the existence of consciousness in any body whatsoever. Through what are we aware that human beings other than ourselves possess, like ourselves, consciousness, the ability to feel sensations, to store up memories, to expe rience emotions? Simply through a thousand material signs, which we note and interpret just as we note and inter pret the multitude of material phenomena which assail our senses at every moment of our life. The only reason why our mental life appears to us so sharply divided from the external, material world is that we each possess, regarding our own mental life, "inside information." Through count less sources, by way of a thousand nervous channels, a thousand minute chemical changes in our blood or in our tissues, we possess at every moment a vast quantity of in formation regarding the happenings in our brain or spinal cord of which the external observer is, at present, neces sarily ignorant. The task which, in this territory, faces science to-day is that of inventing means of throwing open these sources of information to the senses of universal humanity; of making available for comparison and meas urements phenomena as yet inaccessible, buried in the consciousness of the individual. It is this task which, as regards sensation and memory, has been successfully ini tiated through the labors of Weber, Ebbinghaus and their successors, and there can be no doubt that, by methods however devious or refined, we shall ultimately complete the task so auspiciously begun, not only as regards the simpler phenomena of sensation and memory but also the most complex and recondite phenomena of our mental life.1 1 It is obvious that the above considerations remain equally valid whether</page><page sequence="6">37* THE MONIST. A detailed account of the elaborate investigations which have sprung from the researches of Weber and of Ebbing haus would, save to the specialist, be wearisome in the extreme; but the main results, and the principles under lying these, can readily be stated in concise form. It is a matter of every-day experience that we cannot so readily perceive a slight difference between the strength of two stimuli, when the stimuli are large as when they are small. If we hold in our hand a pound weight we do not perceive a noticeable increase in the sensation of weight upon the addition to it of a tenth of an ounce; but if the weight which we are holding in our hand is an ounce then the addition to it of a tenth of an ounce will call forth a perceptible increase in the sensation of weight. In a brightly illuminated room the light of a candle makes barely any perceptible difference to the apparent illumina tion, while in a dark or poorly illuminated room a candle will appear to afford considerable illumination. During the decade 1840-50 Weber published an extensive series of investigations upon the amount by which a stimulus must be increased in strength in order to produce a just notice able difference in sensation, and his results were formulated in the well-known Weber-law, which may be expressed in words as follows: "In order to produce a just noticeable difference in the intensity of a sensation the stimulus must always be increased in the same proportion" ; that is, if we can just perceive the difference between the weight of an ounce and that of eleven-tenths of an ounce then we shall be just able to perceive the difference between the apparent weight of a pound and that of eleven-tenths of a pound. we regard the universe from the point of view of materialism or from that of psychomonism. Either point of view involves the conception of the essential identity of those phenomena which, at present, are accessible only to individual consciousness and those which are accessible to the consciousness of universal humanity. The distinction between materialism and psychomonism is there fore a mere verbal quibble, comparable with that ancient and knotty problem, whether the owl first originated from the egg, or the egg from the owl.</page><page sequence="7">MEMORY, SENSATION : BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION. 373 If we can just perceive the difference between the intensity of illumination afforded by a sixteen candle-power lamp and that afforded by a seventeen candle-power lamp, then we shall be able to just perceive the difference between the illumination afforded by a thirty-two candle-power lamp and that afforded by a thirty-four candle-power lamp. If the addition to any given weight of one-sixteenth of its amount just enables us to perceive an increase in the sen sation of weight which it calls forth, then we shall have to add to any other weight whatever, the same proportion, one-sixteenth of its amount, in order to similarly call forth a just perceptible increase in the sensation of weight. Here was the first indication of a definite mathematical law obtaining in the realm of mental phenomena ; the just noticeable difference in sensation was found to be a definite mathematical function of the strength of the stimulus call ing forth the sensation ; mental phenomena were delivered over, once for all, into the hands of the scientific investi gator ; the law of invariable sequence had again prevailed. But in what manner, it may be asked, does this investi gation differ from the endeavor of the hypothetical piece of iron, alluded to above, to measure its own length ? Who is the judge of a "just noticeable difference in sensation" save the investigator himself? The answer is that the case is very materially different from that of the hypothet ical piece of iron, in that the observation is capable of reference to external standards. It is true that the sub ject's consciousness of his own sensation is a thing which cannot be measured by any other standards than his own, but the observer's consciousness of the subject's sensation is capable of being measured by external standards, be cause it is derived from some material sign displaved by the subject. It is this material sign or reaction which is actually being measured. The subject is required to say a word or tap a key which closes an electric circuit, or per</page><page sequence="8">374 THE MONIST. form some other definite preconcerted signal in order to notify the observer of the fact that he has perceived a just noticeable alteration in the apparent intensity of the stim ulus ; but he is not conveying to the observer his own con sciousness of his sensation, derived from "internal evi dence" unavailable to the observer. He is, on the con trary, conveying to the observer his consciousness of the subject's sensation, that is, a material token, differing in no sense from the countless material tokens wherefrom we infer that our fellow beings are, like ourselves, sentient organisms, and upon which, were it not for our "inside information" regarding our own cerebral states, we should have to depend for all our cognizance of mental phenom ena. But material tokens can be reduplicated, recorded, and they, or the phenomena leading to them, can be meas ured by universal standards; whereas our internal con sciousness of our sensations cannot.2 In 1885s Ebbinghaus published a series of investiga tions upon memory by means of which he demonstrated that this apparently intangible quantity could also be sub jected to measurement. In order to exclude the distracting influence of the associations called up by the meaning at tached to words, he used, as material for learning, syllables each composed of three letters and devoid of any linguistic significance whatever. A variable number of syllables were repeated until the first perfect repetition was secured. In the accompanying table are given his results, although * The statement which is to be found in some psychological literature, that the perception of the "just noticeable difference" in the apparent intensity of a stimulus involves a judgment upon the part of the subject, is simply an ex ample of that endless series of judgments, judgments upon judgments, judg ments upon judgments upon judgments, etc., the simultaneous existence of which, within his own consciousness, any one can readily persuade himself by a few minutes of introspection. Thus "I know" being granted, there can be no question that "I know that I know," while the proposition "I know that I know that I know" is equally incontrovertible, and I could not have written this had I not known that I know that I know that I know; and thus this highly unprofitable concatenation of unrealities can be extended ad absurdum. ? .

Given a constant condition of the subject du ring a period of the experiment (absence of fatigue etc.) and a constant rate of increase or decrease in the intensity of the stimulus (instantaneous), the only quantities vary ing throughout Weber's experiment are the intensity of the stimulus and a just perceptible alteration in its appa rent intensity. Thus we are enabled to ascertain the man ner in which the one varies with the other ; we are enabled to ascertain, not only that the just noticeable difference in sensation is a function (in the mathematical sense) of the strength of the stimulus (i. e., that the just noticeable difference in sensation varies when the strength of the stimulus varies), but we are enabled to ascertain the pre cise character of the function, to formulate it in mathe matical symbols thus: dR/R = &amp;.&lt;/S where (dR) is the increase in the stimulus of strength (R) which gives rise to a just noticeable difference (dS) in the sensation and (k) is, under the conditions of the experiment, a con stant. Were the experiment of such a character that the</page><page sequence="10">376 THE MONIST. number of variable quantities could not be controlled in the manner outlined above, so that three or more quantities varied simultaneously during the experiment, then the problem of ascertaining the function connecting these vari ables would be much more difficult or even impossible. As we have seen, Ebbinghaus, by inventing ingenious meth ods of measuring memory, has not only shown that quan tity of memory is a function of the time spent in learning, which is a matter of common knowledge, but has furnished us with data which, as we shall see, enable us to ascertain the exact nature of this function. Similarly, as Loeb has pointed out,4 instincts are functions of the tropisms, but here extended research has still to be performed in order to learn how to eliminate adventitious variables and thus enable us to ascertain the exact nature of the functions. This is the invariable procedure of science : first, meth ods are found of measuring or detecting the variables in volved; next, methods are sought to isolate as few as possible of these variables and determine whether, and in what manner, they depend upon one another (in other words, what functions they are of one another) and then to admit more variables, as few as possible at the time, in order to determine in what manner these additional vari ables affect the relations subsisting between those origi nally chosen; thus proceeding from the simple to the com plex, the particular to the general. This is the reverse of the procedure of the metaphysicians who, ignoring the particular in the search for the general, forget that the general is simply an anastomosis of particulars and that our knowledge of the general is therefore necessarily con terminous with our knowledge of each of the particulars, of the functions connecting them and of the manner in which they anastomose.5 4 Cf. J. Loeb, Comparative Physiology of the Brain and Psychology. New York, 1900, chap. XIII. 5 "The aim of research is the discovery of the equations which subsist</page><page sequence="11">MEMORY, SENSATION: BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION. 377 The data obtained by the methods outlined above, alone constitute scientific knowledge. When we have determined, and can express in mathematical symbols, the function connecting two variables we have obtained all the knowl edge that can be obtained regarding these two variables per se; but these methods alone do not lead us very far. The senses, unaided by the imagination, or by a knowledge of phenomena cognate to those under investigation, seldom, and then only by accident, perceive variables or relations subsisting between variables other than those of the most obvious description. It is here that the legitimate use of the scientific hypothesis is found. The scientific hypothesis is to be valued, not necessarily for its intrinsic truth, but for the fidelity with which it represents known phenomena, for the relations between variables which it indicates, for the hitherto hidden facts which it leads us to ascertain. An hypothesis is to the scientific discoverer what his tel escope is to an explorer; it leads him to investigate new horizons, suggests to him possibilities beyond the reach of his unaided vision, stimulates him to fresh explorations. True, what he sees on the far horizon may only be the mirage, but he is stimulated thereby to research, and the result is that a fresh area is triangulated, a blank space upon the map is filled in.6 between the elements of phenomena"; Ernst Mach, "The Economical Nature of Physics," Popular Scientific Lectures, Chicago, Open Court Publishing Co., 1896, p. 205. ? It may here be pointed out, in order to remove some prevailing miscon ceptions regarding science, that scientific controversy invariably rages over hypotheses and not over scientific knowledge, i. e., ascertained facts or func tions. The controversy is, however, frequently more stimulating than the rival hypotheses themselves, and may result in the unearthing of a vast body of facts which otherwise might not have been brought to light for a protracted period. Controversy over scientific knowledge is almost unknown to the his tory of science. True, observations are frequently made which are erroneous, but a subsequent observer invariably corrects the error of his predecessor. Every published experiment is repeated indefinitely, and, should difference of opinion regarding an observation exist, it is almost immediately set at rest by an overwhelming majority of affirmations upon one side or upon the other. Instances wherein facts have been the subject of prolonged controversy are so rare in the history of science that each instance is unique. A remarkable example of this rare class of discussion is that which took place over the so</page><page sequence="12">378 THE MONIST. It is a remarkable fact that the results obtained by Weber and Ebbinghaus have, beyond a few immediate applications, done very little to extend our knowledge of the field of mental phenomena beyond that knowledge which was conveyed in the results of their own investigations. The field has been remarkably sterile, barren of sugges tions and results. True, a vast number of minute and laborious investigations have been made upon the lines laid down by Weber and Ebbinghaus, but their result has been almost exclusively to confirm and amplify the results obtained by those observers. The reason for this is, I think, to be sought in the almost total absence of scientific hypotheses from the literature published by Weber, Eb binghaus, and their successors. "The unf ruitf ulness of brain investigation is due, however, only partially to the diffi culty of the matter. The main cause seems to be the entire absence of any working hypothesis, or even an approxi mate idea, as to the nature of cerebral activity."7 Scien tific investigation deprived of scientific hypothesis leads to an indefinite reduplication of similar results, an indefi nite and sterile refinement of method and technique, and, finally, to the exhaustion of the field of research, until the discovery of entirely fresh methods, or the invention of hypotheses, opens up new fields of research, indicates un suspected possibilities, relations hitherto undetected. In what direction can we look for such a working hypothesis in the field of psychology? As Loeb has pointed out8 valuable clues are afforded by the tropisms. I believe that clues of equal value are afforded by the phenomena of memory; I will here only treat of the latter. called 'Ways"; their existence was repeatedly affirmed and denied until the situation became intolerable and a host of investigators intervened to settle the dispute. The result of their labors was the obliteration of the w-rays and no one, so far as I am aware, positively affirms their existence to-day. Cf. an article by H.

The mental phenom enon which we term the cognizance of a word renders more easy the repetition of that cognizance?we remember the word, that is, we can call up its image or sound so readily, after a certain number of repetitions, that we can finally dispense with the external image of the word alto gether. Various attempts have been made, of which the best known are those of Gall and M?nk,10 to explain the phenom ena of memory upon a structural basis. According to these investigators each memory-image is localized in a partic ular ganglion-cell in the brain and is represented therein by a definite structure. This hypothesis has, however, proved completely sterile; no adequate evidence of this physical localization of memories has ever been adduced, even by its most enthusiastic exponents, while numerous phenomena are in flagrant contradiction with the hypoth esis.11 Moreover, even if such a structural modification occurs in the brain, it must be preceded by physical and chemical changes in the cerebral tissues, and it is therefore to physical and chemical phenomena that we must, what ever hypothesis is adopted, look for the origin of the mem ory-trace. For various reasons, which I cannot dwell upon here, a purely physical explanation of the formation of the memory-trace must be excluded12 and the search for a working-hypothesis regarding the formation of the mem J.

To answer this question we must make a short digression. I have no doubt that the majority of my readers have heard of "catalysors," or, at any rate, of those catalysors which occur in the living organism and are termed "fer ments" ; but I suspect that very few have an accurate con ception of what a catalysor is. A catalysor is a substance which, when added to a mixture of chemical substances which are undergoing a chemical reaction, accelerates the reaction. It does not initiate the reaction, it cannot start a chemical reaction which would not otherwise occur, but it accelerates the re action which is already taking place, by removing some resistance which hinders its progress. A catalysor is to a chemical reaction what axle-grease is to the rotation of a wheel; it removes the friction which prevents its rapid progress. The mechanism whereby the catalysor accelerates the reaction is, in most cases, perfectly well understood, and the phenomena of catalysis can be, and are, reduced to mathematical, i. e., functionalistic terms; the catalysors or ferments occurring in the living organism differ in no essential from ordinary, inorganic catalysors, and their action obeys the same laws. A catalysor does not accelerate every chemical reac tion; each catalysor accelerates a given reaction or group of reactions; thus zinc accelerates (i. e., catalyses) the transformation of alcohol into formaldehyde; finely di vided gold, platinum, or charcoal, accelerate the decom position of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen; acids accelerate the transformation of starch into sugar; the ferment pepsin, which occurs in the stomach, accel erates the chemical decomposition of the proteins of our food,?the list might be prolonged indefinitely.</page><page sequence="15">MEMORY, SENSATION: BIOCHEMICAL CONCEPTION. 381 There are certain reactions, however, which produce their own catalysors; that is, one of the products of the chemical transformation accelerates its progress.13 It is easy to see what must happen in such a case ; the reaction proceeds slowly at first but, as it continually produces more and more catalysor, it proceeds more and more rapidly until, as it approaches completion, that is, as the material undergoing transformation gets used up, the reaction grad ually slows ofif. Thus the curve expressing the relation between the amount of material transformed, and the time, is j-shaped, expressing the fact that the reaction proceeds at first slowly, then more rapidly and then, again, more slowly. This curve furthermore expresses the fact that the amount of transformation is a definite function of the time, a function which can readily be expressed in mathe matical terms. The essential feature of such a reaction is that it takes place more readily as a result of having already taken place to a certain extent. Are there any indications of chemical transformations such as these occurring in living organisms? The an swer is in the affirmative ; the chemical phenomena under lying cell-division and growth are of this character14 and it has been pointed out that the phenomena underlying muscular contraction are of this description.15 As an ex ample of such chemical transformations in the central ner vous system I may cite the following. 13 The "spontaneous" oxidation or "tarnishing" which many metals un dergo when exposed to the air is a reaction of this type. 14 As regards cell-division, cf.

It is well known that the rhythmic movements of res piration are primarily controlled by the medulla oblonga ta, or lower part of the brain. It is a classical fact of mamma lian physiology that injury to a certain portion of the me dulla results in instant cessation of respiration, and that circumstances affecting the condition of the medulla (i. e., heating, cooling, etc.) profoundly affect the character of the respiratory movements. Nearly every living tissue produces, as a result of its activities, carbonic and lactic acids, and there is no reason to suppose that cerebral tissue differs from other tissues in this particular. In fact I have shown, and others have shown, by different methods, that acid is developed in the brain as a result of stimu lating sensory nerves.16 Now it is a familiar fact that in suffocation the respiratory movements at first increase enormously in force and rapidity; the suffocating animal or man "gasps for breath." What is the essential feature of suffocation ? The blood can, for some reason or other, no longer be ventilated in the lungs, carbonic acid gas cannot escape from the body and, consequently, the con centration of carbonic acid in the blood and in the tissues increases. As we have seen, the result of this is an increase in the velocity and force of the respiratory movements, and it is an obvious possibility that this increase in the rate of the respiratory movements is due to a direct action of the carbonic acid in the blood upon the tissues of the medulla oblongata. When one acid accelerates a chemical reac tion others usually do so, and, in confirmation of the view expressed above, I have shown that when dilute acids are directly applied to the medulla of a frog, a marked increase in the rate of its respiratory movements takes place, often amounting to several hundred percent.17 Here we have 1?

Acid is produced in the activity of cer ebral tissue and acids accelerate its activity. Here we have, also, the obvious suggestion of a work ing-hypothesis of memory. During the perusal, for ex ample, of a printed word, acid is produced in some por tion of the cerebral tissue, hence the word is more readily repeated until, after a certain number of repetitions, we can dispense with the external stimulus of the printed word and repeat the process of cognition spontaneously.* It is easy to show, but I will not here venture upon the necessary mathematics, that, for a limited number of syl lables, it follows from the above hypothesis, namely, that the extent of the memory-trace is proportional to the amount of material transformed in a self-catalysed chem ical reaction, that the number of syllables memorized must be connected with the number of repetitions (or time of learning) according to the following function: log n = Kr+ b where is the number of syllables memorized, r is the number of repetitions, and and b are constants (that is, do not vary when and r vary). We have seen that the measurements of Ebbinghaus have placed in our hands exact data concerning the de pendence of the number of syllables learnt, upon the number of repetitions. For a given number of repetitions we can, from the above formula, calculate how many syllables should, were our hypothesis correct, be memorized?in the following table these theoretical deductions from our hy pothesis and the data actually obtained by Ebbinghaus are compared : *)Since the above was written I have found that Wilh. Ostwald (Vor lesungen ?ber Natur-Philosophie, Leipsic, 1902, p. 368) had previously put forward a suggestion embodying the germs of a theory of memory somewhat resembling that herein described.</page><page sequence="18">384 THE MONIST.

Our hypothesis has already borne fruit. It has enabled us to anticipate the exact nature of the hitherto undetermined function connecting the amount of material memorized and the time of learning, and our anticipations have proved correct. It can also be easily shown, but again I will refrain from the mathematics involved, that, provided our hypoth esis were correct, the Weber law of sensation would ne 18 W. G. Smith, Psychol.

One more illustration of the possible applications of the hypothesis and I will conclude. Every stimulus takes a certain time to be perceived ; when we touch a red-hot coal we do not, as we imagine, instantly perceive the heat. Minute as the interval is between the application of the stimulus and its perception, it can nevertheless be accurately measured by the exact methods of experimental psychol ogy. It can readily be shown that, were the above hypoth esis correct, the period required to perceive a stimulus (for stimuli not too intense) should be connected with the in tensity of the stimulus according to the following function : where t is the time required to perceive a stimulus of in tensity / and A, and C are constants, that is, do not Cattell19 has published a number of observations upon the time required for a color to be correctly perceived ; his results for one subject and with orange light are compared, in the following table, with the deductions from the above formula, the time is given in thousandths of a second.

The modern psy chologist has devoted himself almost wholly to measure ment and description, and he has succeeded in measuring with the utmost refinement, it is true, a limited number of phenomena, but his field of investigation has been nar row, his horizon contracted. It appears to me that by a well-balanced combination of the two methods, by a judi cious admixture of scientific hypothesis as a guide to scien tific observation, we may hope to achieve, in the not too distant future, a scientific knowledge of mental phenomena not incomparable with our knowledge of phenomena of the external, material world.
