<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLAYWRIGHTS, PATIENTS, AND PROFESSIONALS From Obscurity to Center Stage by WILLIAM F. MAY Thirty years ago, critics singled out Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman as a landmark play; it broke with the conventions of classical tragedy in that its hero was an ordi- nary person. Traditionally, only extraordinary people- kings, generals, and ministers of state-were a fit subject for tragedy. Servants, gravediggers, maids, and salesmen either played secondary roles or provided comic relief. They stepped out of obscurity for a moment or two, making only minor contributions to the unfolding of high drama. Recently, plays have shifted focus to a new class of the extraordinary-those whom remarkable accident, defect, demon, or fate has removed to the margins of society or segregated from its life altogether. Playwrights have pulled these hitherto banished folk out of obscurity and put them at center stage. Children of a Lesser God by Mark Medoff deals with a young woman who is deaf and mute. Shadow Box by Michael Christofer accompanies several people through various stages of dying. Peter Shaffer's Equus focuses on a boy whom the authorities charge with blinding six horses. Whose Life is it Anyway? dramatizes the efforts of a young man, paralyzed from the neck down, to free himself from a hospital in order to die. Bernard Pomerance's Elephant Man tells the story of a hideous car- nival freak who becomes the ward of a British physician and the darling of Victorian London society. And Joe Egg features a ten-year-old child so retarded as to be able only to moan and drool. In her father's words, she is nothing more than a "living parsnip." There are still others. Peter Nichols, the author of Joe Egg, has also written a highly successful comedy, National Health, which takes place in a hospital ward for the dying. The American playwright, John Guare, has made the cen- tral figure in The House of Blue Leaves a demented ex- serviceman; the soldier plans to vault from obscurity to fame by "fragging the Pope" in the course of his Holiness's visit to Yankee stadium. Another of Guare's plays, Bosoms and Neglect, centers on an eighty-three-year-old woman, blind and dying of breast cancer, and her relation to her son and his lover, both of whom are under psychiatric care. Lanford Wilson's Fifth of July deals with a disabled Viet- WILLIAM F. MAY is Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. Professor of Christian Ethics at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University.

Duet for One by Tom Kempinski presents multiple sclerosis on stage. Arthur Kopit's Wings presents the verbal and intellectual travail of a stroke victim. And the film Inside Moves, di- rected by Richard Donner, follows a failed suicide to a sa- loon whose habitues variously suffer from blindness, paralysis, and the like-a kind of All in the Family for cripples. For the most part, these people live beyond the bound- aries of ordinary life. Society has sequestered them and, in many cases, thrown them into the hands of professionals. Doctors, nurses, social workers, teachers, psychiatrists, and even clergymen crowd the stage. With few exceptions (The Elephant Man, for example) these professionals do not fare well at the hands of the playwright. The clergymen are in- variably hypocrites or fools. Nurses are officious; social workers, obtuse; and doctors, for the most part, overbear- ing. Thus the central figures of the plays are doubly the victim-society has expelled them and professionals ma- nipulate them and intensify their suffering. Equus, Whose Life is it Anyway? and Joe Egg all make such iatrogenic suffering a governing theme. Ek . . . Ek . . . Equus and Ecstasy Martin Dysart, the psychiatrist who is the central figure in Equus, offers a convenient symbol if one wants to undercut the claims of moder medical therapy. The psychiatrist works at the outermost reaches of the rationalist's terrain. Although the softest and most humanistic of the scientists, in a sense the psychiatrist is the most ambitious; he would extend the light of reason to the obscurest corers of the human heart. The psychiatrist provides the terms for nam- ing and therefore controlling deviancy-madness in others and neuroses in himself. Fittingly enough, Dysart-an out- post figure-works in a provincial hospital where the em- pires of reason and politics reach their limits and begin to curl back on themselves-a sort of Khartoum or Saigon of the professional spirit. Dysart, a hero/therapist, suffers self-doubts. At first, these doubts obscurely soil his dreams. He imagines him- self to be "a chief priest in Homeric Greece" charged with the task of killing a group of children. Fearing that his nau- sea will betray him, he performs the sacrifice in order to appear professional to his colleagues and escape a similar fate at their hands. Ironically, the psychiatrist whose special power derives from his ability to unmask others now hides behind a mask. The Hastings Center Report, December 1981 - 24</page><page sequence="2">The psychiatrist's first encounter with a disturbed seven- teen-year-old, Alan Strang, provokes this troubling dream. The boy, a stablehand whom a magistrate has asked Dysart to treat, has blinded six horses with a metal spike. Science can only explain the deed as the irrational climax of a crip- pled and diminished life. But the psychiatrist unearths more significance. The boy worships horses. He confuses them with both God, the all-seeing and all-knowing Father, and the Son of God, the suffering Christ, who takes, as it were, a metal bit in his mouth. The boy, like an acolyte, curries and serves the horses by day and rides them at night, naked and bare- back, as one fused with deity. John Dexter, who directed the play in New York, lifts the audience into this religious experience through brilliant staging. Young men in brown body suits play the sensual horses; their splendid stylized heads and elevated metal shoes suggest the nervous, restless energy of head and hoof. A spinning platform carries the horse that carries the boy in dervish ecstasy. Not surprisingly, sin steals into this ecstatic world in the guise of a woman. She seduces the boy in the stable-in the presence of the horses. Like the ancient Israelites, he com- mits-or attempts to commit-his sin in the house of and under the omniscient eye of God. In lashing out with the spike to blind his beloved Equus, he blinds the accusing eye of deity. The psychiatrist "heals" the boy, but at the core of the play a suspicion gnaws: to cure is to diminish; to make nor- mal is to flatten out; returning the boy to ordinary life dead- ens him. Dysart fears that he has reduced the boy, who has seen ecstasy, to the same "dead stare" that a million adults wear. (It is this attack upon the goals of therapy that has roused the disdain of the medical profession for the play.) The psychiatrist believes that he diminished the boy when he removed his capacity for adoration. Dysart: "Can you think of anything worse one can do to anybody than to take away their worship?"' The deprivation is irremediable. "Passion, you see, can be destroyed by a doctor. It cannot be created." Dysart, in fact, envies the boy his ecstasy. "He galloped," Dysart bitterly recalls, ticking off the details of his own plodding, married life with a brisk professional wife. His only brush with the Dionysian is an annual three weeks' vacation in pagan Greece, "suitcase crammed with Kao-Pectate." The heterosexual world does not fare well at Peter Shaffer's hands. The three couples in the play fail misera- bly. Mismatches abound: Martin Dysart, with his pagan fantasies and his no-nonsense Church of Scotland wife; Alan Strang, the night-rider, and his practical girl friend of the stable scene; and Alan Strang's parents: the father in this case the more prosaic of the pair, a flat-earthed socialist, and the mother, a Bible-quoting, religious fanatic who re- jects her husband sexually but who is not unacquainted with ecstasy. She unwittingly provides her son with the text (from Job) for his liturgies: Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? The glory of his nostrils is terrible! He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage! He saith among the trumpets- Ha! Ha! In each pairing, a prosaic, secular type is mismatched with a romantic who yearns for more-for the magnifica- tion of the human into something beyond itself. Only the father fails fully to conform to type. Beneath his disdain for an outsize passion lurks a pathetic and compensatory quest for a small-size ecstasy in the skin-flicks he frequents- where the men stare up at the screen "like they were in church." The out-of-the-ordinary world that takes over in Alan's night rides has a homosexual cast. "Here we go," cries out Alan, The king rides out on Equus, mightiest of horses. Only I can ride him. He lets me turn him this way and that. His neck comes out of my body. It lifts in the dark. Equus, my Godslave . . . I'm stiff! Stiff in the wind ... Feel me on you! On you! On you! On you! I want to be in you I want to be you forever and ever! Equus, I love you! Now!- Bear me away! Make us one person! Elsewhere, Dysart jealously contrasts the two worlds: I watch that woman knitting, night after night-a woman I haven't kissed in six years-he stands in the dark an hour, suck- ing the sweat off his God's hairy cheek! Or, again, the psychiatrist speaks to the boy: Above you, staring down at you, is that great horse's head, and the cream dropping from it. Can you see that? The cream of the ride and the fusion with the beloved mean pain. Alan explains, When the horse first appeared, I looked up into his mouth. It was huge. There was this chain in it. The fellow pulled it and cream dripped out. I said, "Does it hurt?" and he said-the horse said- said . . . In curing Alan, Dysart recognizes that he will remove the pain. He will return the boy to the bourgeois world of con- ventional ties and petty pleasures-his great passion ex- cised. But in eliminating the agony, he will have destroyed the ecstasy. He will have imposed a deeper level of depriva- tion on the boy. In healing, the psychiatrist miniaturizes, the shrink shrinks. Given that outcome, he confesses, "I stand in the dark with a pick in my hand, striking at heads!" Dysart recognizes the deeper suffering which he himself imposes, and therefore he himself now suffers irrevocably. "There is now, in my mouth, this sharp pain. And it never comes out." Equus ran on Broadway for four years, longer than any The Hastings Center _I ? _ 25</page><page sequence="3">serious drama in the history of the New York theater. It is partly a detective story (not of the whodunit, but the whydunit variety) but mostly a liturgy, a liturgy, moreover, that contrasts with the slow-paced, ponderous liturgies of today's mainline Christian churches, where participants sit sandbagged in their pews, gravely worshipping before a grave God. This liturgy offers Dionysian movement and transport, a chance to shuck off daytime ties to work and mate and to ride the night-stiff in the wind. The play re- flects the modem thirst for ecstasy. On Ecstasy, Violence, and Terrorism The word "ecstasy" means, literally, to stand outside one's self, to receive a new identity from beyond one's self. We usually reserve the term for the exhilarating experience of love or of mystic religion. But Equus reminds us that our culture reveals its craving for ecstasy more often in the ritu- als of violence than of love. Shaffer wrote his play after reading a newspaper article about a boy who incomprehen- sibly blinded six horses. Such violent incidents assault us daily in our newspapers and TV broadcasts. Just two days' rations of recent headlines from the front page of the Regis- ter in Des Moines, Iowa, make the point: American Shot Twice By Hijackers Rain, Wind Lash State Tornado Damages Farm Poland Close to Anarchy Soviets Warn Reagan Shot in Chest A Sickening Feeling Grips Nation Shaffer was right to cast his drama in a liturgical setting, placing some members of the audience directly on the stage, concelebrants, as it were, in the proceedings. Televi- sion has accustomed us to vicarious participation in the lit- urgies of violence, most notably through its coverage of the ritual forms of terrorism. The terrorist confronts us as an ecstatic who acquires spe- cial leverage over others because he is ready not only to kill but to die. At the same time, he does not appear to use power only for political ends. (A liberal once complained that the Irish Provos bombed their way to the conference table and then bombed themselves away from it again.) As in all religious rituals, his action becomes an end in itself. Like the young boy in Equus, the terrorist displays a per- verse daring and a magnified life in which the ordinary con- siderations of job, wife, and politics do not matter. He provides his media audience with victims who have been forcibly lifted out of their humdrum routines. He charges the whole of life with an exhilarating danger. The result is a corrupt festival of death, a celebration that has its own priest and victims and that carries with it the likely risk that the priest himself will become a victim. Responding to the me- dia's violent liturgies with horror and a need to draw near, audiences are momentarily relieved of that other death which is boredom. But the media must serve up an endless supply of violent happenings-whether fictional or real-because the litur- gies of violence fail to offer ultimate satisfaction. The soli- tary reader of the newspaper or the TV watcher may experience a momentary lift. But these liturgies do not en- large us or bind us together or provide a basis for the quoti- dian responsibilities of work, marriage, politics, friendship, and love. We need a different experience of ecstasy for that. From Ecstasy to Autonomy Brian Clark's Whose Life Is It Anyway?2 does not take the medical profession to task for diminishing the patient's life. The catastrophe of impoverishment has already occurred. Ken Harrison, a talented sculptor who broke his neck in a motorcycle accident, has lost the use of all but his head. Chief among his deprivations, he can no longer sculpt or make love. Chief among his complaints: the medical staff prolongs-against his will-his already impoverished life. Six months have passed since the accident-enough time to make clear the limits of his recovery (he will be para- lyzed for life) but also to carry him beyond the trauma- induced depression. Indeed, he is a man of great wit and appeal; his nurses, his physicians, and the audience find this defiant, resolute, and charming man at center stage. He has decided, however, with unwavering lucidity, to get himself released from the hospital in the certain knowledge that, once removed from its support system, he will be dead in six days. The chief consultant in the case, Dr. Emerson, opposes his plan. He interprets the request for dismissal as proof that Harrison is still depressed and orders him forcibly tran- quilized. The patient challenges the physician's right to tranquilize him on the grounds that the doctor is doing it for his own benefit, not Harrison's. "You . . . watched me disturbed, worried, even perhaps, and you can't do any- thing for me-nothing that really matters. I'm paralyzed and you're impotent. This disturbs you . . . So I get the tablet and you get the tranquility." The play poses the issue in terms of patient autonomy vs. paternalistic authority. The title leaves no doubt as to where the playwright stands: whose life is it anyway? The audi- ence quickly lines up with the hero against the medical es- tablishment-the determined Dr. Emerson who would force him to live and the social worker who would hook him up to reading machines and comptometers to improve his quality of life. The conclusion is foregone. Harrison persuades a lawyer to press his case in a court inquiry held at his bedside. The judge decides in his favor. The audience applauds. The de- feated doctor graciously offers to let him stay in the hospital without life support systems but still hopes that before he lapses into a coma Harrison will change his mind. Long before Tom Conti dazzled audiences in London and New York with his performance as the patient, the story had The Hastings Center Report, December 1981 26</page><page sequence="4">a success on British television. It made its way to the United States as an audio-visual on the medical ethics circuit. I saw it back in 1972. For all its success, the play is shallow. It raises only the legal question of whether Ken Harrison can get himself dismissed from the hospital to die. It sys- tematically ignores the moral question: Should he do it? I say systematically because the playwright manipulates the story in such a way as to keep the moral question from surfacing. He gives the patient a social environment exclu- sively composed of professionals-nurses, doctors, a social worker, and lawyers. That limitation, of course, is not en- tirely arbitrary. Catastrophe often converts one's social world from the personal and familial to the professional. But Clark effectively eliminates from the drama those per- sons whose intimate ties to the patient would raise more sharply the question of whether he ought to kill himself. The playwright conveniently avoids the moral complica- tions that Harrison's fiancee and his mother would intro- duce. Harrison dismisses his fiancee two weeks before the story begins on the grounds that "she's a young healthy woman. She wants babies-real ones. Not ones that never will learn to walk." And he reports that his Scottish mother accedes to his wishes with the comment: "Aye lad, it's thy life . . . don't worry about your dad-I'll get him over it." Having conveniently dispatched the girl friend and the fam- ily, Clark can turn to hospital staff whose role is only pro- fessional, seasoned with a dash of the transient sentimental. Staff members are close enough to Harrison to make his death poignant but not so close as to suffer deeply. This emotional distance is just about where the audience is lo- cated. From this privileged perspective they can get behind the banner of autonomy without raising too many questions about its right uses. To put the same point dramatically rather than morally: the play has a protagonist, but no serious antagonist. (The doctor is hardly a worthy opponent. Legally, the patient has a right to be dismissed from the hospital. He is resoundingly sane.) The only antagonist in the play is the patient's own wit and charm. Members of the audience hope he wins his duel with the doctor; they applaud his final legal triumph. But then their applause trails off. They suddenly realize that his winning means they lose this appealing man. His charm provides the only undertow to his vigorously pressed pur- suit of the freedom to die. Thus the play closes with Ken Harrison alone on the stage. That's what autonomy is all about in this play: a man who is charming but without ties and therefore without any serious moral struggle.* As it stands, the dramatic deficiencies of Clark's play re- flect the tides in a culture that has little to say once it has announced its commitment to autonomy. An emphasis on *The Williamstown Theater put on a version this past summer that brings the fiancee into the story. It will be interesting to see whether the author added this character merely in anticipation of the movie version of the play (which calls for more variation in scenes than a hospital room can provide) or whether the intro- duction of serious human ties will shift the moral balance to the question of the substantive uses of freedom. patient autonomy to the exclusion of all else diminishes both the patient's moral significance and the professional's moral responsibility. The patient tends to shrink morally if one proclaims no more than the indeterminate liberty over which he presides. In that view it suffices that the patient makes his own deci- sion. What decision he makes or what behavior he displays is not of moral interest. This apparent respect for autonomy actually consigns the patient to moral oblivion. At one point, Clark touches the edge of this problem when Ken Harrison criticizes the social worker for failing to reprimand him for his own bad behavior. Harrison rightly interprets her tolerance as the worst sort of exclusion. A first step toward reentry into human community for any deviant or stricken group (patients, criminals, the elderly) occurs when others take them seriously as moral beings rather than treat- ing them as mere bundles of wants and interests. Ethicists unwittingly contribute to this exclusion of pa- tients from the moral community when they argue for pa- tient autonomy but then shift ethical attention exclusively to the duties of the caregiver, neglecting the obligations of the care-receiver. This perspective ultimately reduces the pro- fessional's moral responsibility. It indicts the physician who intervenes officiously in the lives of others, either for the professional's own sake (I get the Valium and you get the tranquility) or for the sake of the patient (it's my uncondi- tional obligation to save your life). But it tends to ignore ranges of moral responsibility beyond respect for liberty. It deals only with the sins of excess, not of defect. Patients marked by their liberty alone, but without moral respon- sibility, can expect from professionals technical services, no more. Joe Egg and Transcendent Evil Traditionally, the artist finds it difficult to portray God in a work of art. Sin arrests, but grace bores. Stuffing an in- finite being into the frame of a finite work of art shatters the frame, or worse, miniaturizes the object. Constricting God into the sentimental or trivial fails both as an act of faith (God becomes other than He is) and as a work of art (the work distorts its subject). This double failure shows up regularly when Christian art attempts to portray the resurrection, where Jesus breaks in on human history, bursting it with the life of God. Only too often the resurrected Christ fades into a ghostly figure, furled in sheets-a percale image of sleep and death. Not even the imaginative Ingmar Bergman solved the prob- lem in his film Virgin Spring. The young girl's rape and murder provided a convincing crucifixion, but the spring that gushes from the ground where she died offered a wa- tered-down image of resurrection. Dante Alighieri and Hieronymous Bosch managed to de- scribe evil without shattering the work of art that framed it. But twentieth-century evil-whether the Nazi Holocaust, The Hastings Center I - _ _ 27</page><page sequence="5">political torture, or the relentless multiplication of outsize, personal catastrophes-overwhelms the resources not only of the theologian and philosopher but also of the artist. A literary critic and Judaic scholar recently conceded in a con- ference on the Holocaust that, with the possible exception of Elie Wiesel's Night, the literature about the Holocaust fails to achieve greatness. The horror of the event defies the efforts of the stammering artist to express it. Worse, the artist who attempts to depict the Holocaust on a human scale trivializes it into melodrama or soap opera. Attempts to portray disproportionate evil in domestic settings sim- ilarly founder. Given these artistic difficulties, Peter Nichols's play Joe Egg, makes a daring move to portray transcendent evil through comedy. In the play a young couple bear a spastic daughter, so badly damaged that she can communicate nothing; so much a vegetable that the effort of the mother, father, and grandmother to impute to this ten-year-old child a human personality and character, and personal likes and dislikes ventures into anthropomorphism. In scenes be- tween the family and child, Nichols's adults act like ven- triloquists or the sentimental owners of pets. The father, Brian, engages Joe in conversation: Bri: There we are then, lovely. Home again. Safe and sound. You been a good girl? Joe: A-aaah! (This is her closest approach to speech.) Bri: Really good? Joe: Aaaah. Bri: The lady in the bus said you'd been good. Sat by the driver, did you? Joe: Aaaah! Bri: (As though she understood): Saw the Christmas trees? Joe: Aaaah! Bri: And the shops lit up? Joe: Aaaah! Bri: What d'you see? Saw Jesus? Where was he, where was Jesus, you poor softy. Joe: Aaaah! Bri: I see.3 When the parents, speaking quietly to the audience, struggle to interpret the catastrophe that has befallen them, they break into vaudeville routines. In the production at the Philadelphia Drama Guild, the director, Irene Lewis, imaginatively placed a one-man band, replete with drums, on stage for percussive editorial comments, question marks, and exclamation points. The husband and wife slip into set- piece vaudeville routines describing the wife's encounters with doctors and clergymen over the hopeless Joe Egg. In the first of these sketches, the husband plays a less than astute primary-care physician in his first encounter with the mother and baby. Bri: What seems to be the matter? Sheila: I don't really know. Funny turs. Face-making. Bri: Say "Aaah!" Sheila: Not me. The baby. (Bri looks at the cushion.) Bri: Nothing much wrong with this little laddie. Sheila: Lassie. Bri: Lassie. Funny turns you say. How would you describe them? Sheila: Blinking with her eyes, working with her tongue, shak- ing her head, then going all limp. Bri: (Tickling the baby, talking to it): Funny turns indeed at your age. Saucy beggar. We are not amused. Sheila: But what do you think it is? Bri: Wind. Sheila: That's what our friends said. Bri: Always wise to get a second opinion. A medical emergency eventually sends her off to the hos- pital with Joe where the specialist, a music hall version of a German pediatrician, offers his diagnosis: Bri: Mattam, let me try to tell vot your daughter is like. Do you know vot I mean ven I say your daughter vos a vegetable? (Sheila thinks for a moment, gets it, smiles.) Sheila: Yes! You mean your daughter was a vegetable! Bri: Ach himmel! Still is, still is, always vill be! I have trouble vis Englisch werbs. Sheila: But-when people say to me what kind of cripple is your child, shall I say-she's a wegetable-a vegetable? Bri: You vont a vord for her? (Shrugs.) You can say she is a spastic vis a damaged cerebral cortex, multiplegic, epileptic but with no organic malformation of ze brain. Sheila: That is a long word. Bri: Vegetable. Having gotten straight the medical name for the trouble, the mother talks to the vicar to figure out its spiritual mean- ing. The husband plays the clergyman, his long scarf doing double duty as a stole. Sheila: I kept saying, "Why me, why us?" All day long. Then you get tired of that and you say, "Why not me?" Bri: Indeed. You learn humility. You recognize that we are surely in a vale of tears and you are no exception. Sheila: I recognize that I was worse. I'd been promiscuous, you see. All kinds of men. It seemed to me I was responsible for Joe, being punished. Bri: No. No. Sheila: No, I don't mean that either. I held the baby back out of guilt. Bri: Really, my dear, you mustn't believe this. Plenty of women who've slept around afterwards became splendid mothers. Pre- marital intercourse is no longer considered a serious obstacle to being taken into the fold. Sheila: No? Bri: Haven't you read our publications lately? You should. The good old C. of E. is nowadays a far more swinging scene than you seem to suppose. Sheila: I see. Bri: Oh, surely. Where the action is. Sheila: I've never committed adultery. Bri: There you are! That's splendid-fabulous! Crazy! Think no more about it. Nichols follows this giddy theological exchange with a long soliloquy in which the mother wonders what it would be like if her child's brain worked. She recalls the grand- The Hastings Center Report, December 1981 I - -- - - - - I - _ - __ 28</page><page sequence="6">mother's recurrent words, "Wouldn't she be lovely if she was running about?" With that line, a musical comedy spot- light suddenly follows the spastic on stage, where she be- comes a normal child for the moment, skipping rope and singing a children's ditty. Joe: Mrs. D, Mrs. I, Mrs. FFI, Mrs. C, Mrs. U, Mrs. LTY Mrs. D, Mrs. I, Mrs. FFI, Mrs. C, Mrs. U, Mrs. LTY. Joe stops skipping and announces the intermission to the audience. The curtain falls on the first act. The audience ponders the sudden reduction of the problem of evil to a child's spelling game D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T-Y. But there is more to it. Suddenly seeing the child normal in this music hall reverie spells out the finality-the irretrievability-of the loss. In the second act, Nichols uses the speech patterns of drawing room comedy to express contemporary attitudes to domestic tragedy. Married friends appear on the scene- Pam and Freddy-the first, a conventional housewife who would prefer to avoid seeing the child and whose instinctive preference for dodging misery leads her to argue for active euthanasia. Pam: I can't stand anything N.P.A. (Non-Physically Attractive). Old women in bathing suits-and skin diseases-and crip- ples . . . Rowton House-looking men who spit and have hair growing out of their ears . . . No good, I just can't look at them. Freddie won't hear of it, of course. But then he loves a lame dog. Every year he buys so many tickets for the spastic raffle he wins the TV set and every year he gives it to an old folks home. He used to try taking me along on his visits but I said it wasn't me at all and he gave up. One place we went, there were these poor freaks with-oh, you know-enormous heads and so on-and you just feel: oh, put them out of their misery. Well, they wouldn't have survived in nature, it's only modem medicine, so modem medicine should be allowed to do away with them. A committee of doctors and do-gooders naturally, to make sure there's no funny business; if I say gas chamber that makes it sound horrid-but I do mean put to sleep. Her husband Freddie, a former high school friend of Brian's, is a positive-thinking socialist and businessman, who urges the usual activist strategies for dealing with the tragedy-more kids, sperm tests, fertility boosters, adop- tion, and remanding Joe to a residential school. He reproves Brian for his sick jokes that kill the pain but leave the situa- tion untouched. As it turns out, Brian finally opts for an inept version of Pam's proposal and seeks to kill his child. He withholds the medicine for controlling Joe's fits and, with the ingenuity of a hero in a bedroom farce, manages to confuse his wife and everybody else as to Joe's where- abouts. He maneuvers to get Joe outdoors in the bitter cold-in the hopes that she will die. The play is effective not so much because it satirizes adroitly some of the major responses to suffering: the nur- turant mother; the possessive grandmother; the trapped fa- ther; the ineffective professionals; the lame medical and theological explanations of evil; the do-gooder friend; and the advocate of euthanasia who would solve the problem of suffering by eliminating the sufferer. Rather, the play works because it puts sufficient distance between the audi- ence and its subject. The distance I am talking about is neither temporal nor spatial. The mere passage of time hardly deals with evil: it avoids evil by reducing it to a faded memory. "In time you will get over it." Aesthetic distance of a spatial sort-where the movie camera zooms in to a facial closeup or pans across a battlefield-fares no better: such movement merely changes the locus of horror. What is required, instead, is metaphorical distance in which the artist treats the evil in terms other than itself so that language will not break under the burden it bears. Metaphors and similes ordinarily accomplish this by jux- taposing two dissimilar subjects. Nelson Algren's "Chicago is like an old girl friend with a broken nose" shifts the mind away from a single center of attention-Chicago-into a wholly different experience and then unites the two subjects in the reader's mind, illuminating both. Nichols manages this not by juxtaposing two different subjects but by casting the subject of domestic agony in an unexpected form. He flings his tragic play about a spastic child into vaudeville, music hall, drawing room comedy, and bedroom farce. Suddenly his subject acquires the lights and shadows of in- sight which no conventional story line could provide. At a less self-conscious level this re-forming of experi- ence goes on in real life as people cope with their suffering. It is the stories they tell to others rather than the therapeutic strategies they choose that gives their suffering form and enables them to reduce to a routine the details surrounding a husband's death or a daughter's disfigurement. In an impor- tant respect, however, this reduction of experience differs in Nichols's case. Whereas most of us fall into patterned sto- ries in order to maintain our distance or shield ourselves from painful events, Nichols keeps his distance in order to represent events more immediately to others. The first in- tention-if unimpeded-quickly leads to repression; the second-if successful-leads toward the truth by revealing in veiled form what is difficult to confront directly. The large number of plays dealing with the doctor/patient relationship raises a more general question. Why a spate of plays on this subject now? It hardly results from a romantic fascination with doctors as heroes. The physicians in the three plays discussed here increase, prolong, or ignore the suffering of their patients. Disillusionment, rather than hero worship, marks the attitude toward the profession. The an- swer lies rather in the beliefs people have today about what constitutes a significant story, a story powerful enough to capture center stage. Attention fixes less today on people who make things happen than on people to whom things happen. The big events are those in which we are not in charge. Patients nicely focus this passivity. They are triply passive-to the ravages of disease, the ministrations of professionals, and The Hastings Center r 29</page><page sequence="7">the devastating effects of drugs and knife. A general cultural preoccupation with those who are in the grips of disease reflects our disposition to believe that human beings are neither heroic doers nor flagrant sinners, merely suf- ferers. They are acted upon rather than actors. The extraor- dinary circumstances of the patient's plight reflects the ordinary state of affairs. People constantly refer to the "pressures" under which they live, betraying their convic- tion that they do not shape their world. Rather, the world and its pressures push them about; its principalities and powers bear down upon them. Most of us live by the passive voice. At the same time, the patient may be central to the recov- ery of moral agency in the midst of pressures. This has less to do with the ethicist's familiar call for patient autonomy than with the recovery of virtues that can grow even in ad- versity. Not the least of these is the virtue of patience. Se- vere illness, a sudden loss, protracted pain, the curtailed movement of old age, or the birth of a retarded child-all in their different ways upset life plans. Controlling life under the old terms is out of the question, but passivity is not the only alternative. The virtue of patience is not a state of pure passivity. Patience is purposive waiting in the midst of tur- moil; it is a most intense sort of activity, a way of taking control of one's own spirit when all else would go out of control. Such patience is difficult to dramatize, yet it is far more active than that pressured busyness that characterizes most of adult life. Most of adult life gets lived out in a state of passive activ- ity. A rush of obligations gives but the illusion of great and heroic activity. But medical catastrophe punctures the illu- sion. It calls everything to a halt and requires us to get cen- tered, perhaps for the first time, at the deepest level of our lives as resolute beings. Whether that happens is more a question of grace than achievement, but it is one of the deeper themes that waits to emerge with the patient at center stage.

Project on Legislative and Representative Ethics In recent years the public has been increasingly concerned with the moral duties of elected repre- sentatives. In the wake of serious scandals and amid declining public confidence, legislators on both the federal and the state levels have at- tempted to define more precise ethical standards of conduct and to establish mechanisms for en- forcing them. In both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, and in many state legis- latures, new or revised codes of ethics have been written and special ethics committees or commis- sions have been created. Similarly, those holding representational posi- tions in nongovernmental settings have sought to clarify the ethical dimensions of their responsibil- ities and roles. Trustees of hospitals, universities, and nonprofit corporations, members of Institu- tional Review Boards (who review research in- volving human subjects), and many practicing professionals, such as physicians and attorneys, are expected to represent the interests of individu- als or groups while at the same time serving the interests of the public at large. The activity of rep- resentation thus provides a comparative frame- work for the consideration of ethical dilemmas encountered in both political and professional life. In 1981 The Hastings Center was awarded a grant from the Ford Foundation to conduct a ma- jor study of legislative ethics and the ethics of rep- resentation. This project grew out of a preliminary study of the U.S. Senate code of ethics conducted by The Hastings Center in 1980. Scope and Goals of the Project The study will examine those topics now covered in legislative ethics codes, such as financial-dis- closure requirements and conflict-of-interest provi- sions. But it will also consider several broader issues, which have been neglected in previous dis- cussions of legislative ethics-for example, the ethical implications of diverse conceptions of rep- resentation and the ethics of representational ac- tivities in nongovernmental contexts. Our objec- tive is to develop a systematic framework within which the concrete, practical problems of repre- sentative ethics can be addressed in some new and, we hope, more fruitful ways. Request for Information For the purposes of the project, we would like to hear from those interested in the subject. We are particularly interested in collecting information on: legislative ethics codes and governmental eth- ics legislation now in force at the national, state, and local levels; draft codes and legislation now under consideration; legislative orientation mate- rials now in use or in preparation; studies in prog- ress that are pertinent to our project, and the ac- tivities of other groups working in this area. Inquiries and information should be directed to Dr. Daniel Callahan, Director, The Hastings Center, 360 Broadway, Hastings-on-Hudson, NY 10706.
