<plain_text><page sequence="1">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS By H. FRANKFORT I. THE INTERPRETATION OF SEAL DESIGNS Many of the scenes on cylinders are evidently renderings of myths, but great uncertainty prevails as to their interpretation. This is partly due to the incompleteness of our knowledge of the contemporary literature and partly to our inability to grasp the allusions which must have been clear to the clients of the seal-cutters. Apart, however, from these inevitable handicaps, attempts at interpretation have suffered from a singular lack of method. For if it is true that our only hope of utilizing the information of the seals lies in a comparison of their scenes with the texts, it should be equally obvious that a haphazard interpretation of isolated scenes remains necessarily guess-work. If, for instance, a vanquished god is called 'Kingu' or a two-faced figure 'Marduk', such identifications do not carry conviction as long as we do not know precisely in which scenes these figures appear, which versions of each scene are extant, and what bearing the variants of any one scene have upon its interpretation. But, as is so often the case, the archaeological material has been denied the methodical treatment given, as a matter of course, to every text. And yet, as regards myths, the archaeological and the literary evidence reach us in similar forms and should therefore be investigated by parallel methods. Just as the literary form of certain myths has been preserved, firstly, in more than one copy of the same text and, secondly, in more than one version, so certain myths (which remain to be identified) have found pictorial expression on a number of seals which render identical scenes, and again on some which show differing versions. If no attempt is made to interpret a text without reference to every extant copy and version, it is clear that we have similarly to consider all the seals which render a given subject before attempt- ing the interpretation of any individual cylinder amongst them. In short, we have first to establish the pictorial equivalent of a standard text ; next we must discover what fresh details the pictorial variants add to the standard version ; and then only are we in a position to search the literary sources for parallels with the pictured stories. It is clear that a strict discrimination of these three stages of our inquiry throughout this paper would render it extremely tedious. But it should be understood that they underlie our argument in every instance where an inter- pretation of seal designs is given. And since the illustrations necessarily con- tain but a small selection of the material, I have listed in the following Table all the seals relevant to our inquiry and have grouped them according to their 'text', that is, according to their pictorial contents. Though it is evident that a number of Babylonian myths are reflected in the designs on seals from northern Mesopotamia and north Syria, I have not included those in our survey since they cannot be considered as Variants' but</page><page sequence="2">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 3 rather as 'translations' of the Babylonian myths which we are attempting to recognize on the seals.

Leipzig, 1920. It is clear that these groups are units distinct not only in their subject- matter but also in the conventions adopted for its pictorial expression. It would therefore be unwise to generalize without reserve and to assume, for instance, that a god with rays arising from the shoulders always represents Shamash because we can prove this designation to be correct in one or two groups of seals. Similarly a winged figure in mediaeval art usually represents an angel but may in certain compositions, in conjunction with a prostrate body, render the soul ascending to heaven. If, on the other hand, figures which occur in more than one of our groups, and must therefore be studied along separate lines, appear in the end to repre- sent the same gods, we have obtained a most valuable corroboration of our conclusions. We shall find that this is the case with Ninurta and with Zu. Since some cylinders depict several scenes they may belong to more than one group at a time. The joint appearance of scenes on one seal does not always seem to prove that they are related or refer to the same myth. As to variants within one group, they may either render more precisely a detail only summarily rendered in the standard version ; or they may contain new information. An instance of the first type of variant is Plate II, g&gt; as com- pared with Plate p,/, which represents the standard version of group II. In Plate 11, g, and in one other seal of the group, care has been taken to differen- tiate the sprays projecting from the god's body. The class of variant which provides us with entirely new information is illustrated in Plate iv, d\ the kneeling figure with the blowpipe is again found in only one other instance within the group. This type of variant tends to become a new composition, and we find indeed that some of the less numerous groups, such as X, consist entirely of seals which evidently depict the same myth but are composed afresh on each occasion. We shall find that the existence of variants in each group is of the utmost importance for us, since they elucidate not only each other but also the standard version. The Table of groups is by no means complete. I have included neither groups of which the meaning is self-evident (Shamash rising, for instance) nor such as are well established as groups but defy, at the moment, identification; such are, amongst others, the 'Winged Gate with Bull' and the 'Goddess with Child'. I have no doubt that some of these groups could be brought into relation with the texts, but research in that direction would threaten to obscure the conclusions reached in our more limited inquiry. For it will be found that the groups here discussed are all interrelated. They focus, in fact, round two centres of interest?a figure and a festival. The figure is a pre-Sargonid god of fertility, the festival the greatest religious annual event in the Babylon of later times which is known to us through the texts: the New Year Festival.</page><page sequence="5">6 H. FRANKFORT As to the pre-Sargonid god of fertility, we have discovered at Tell Asmar during the last two years, in the course of our excavations for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, considerable material pertaining to his worship. Its coherence is such that it seems a mistake to treat the seals in isolation, and I have, consequently, in the second section of this paper, dis- cussed the first four groups of seals with special reference to the fact that they are represented at Tell Asmar and must, therefore, fit in with the clear and con- sistent picture of the local cult which we have gained in the course of our work. As to the Babylonian New Year Festival, there is a considerable number of seals figuring events which we know as part of the ritual. The central figure of the festival remains, however, a problematic personage, and in some cases, e.g. group IX, it would be premature to give him a name since our seals ante- date by 2,000 years the texts upon which we must draw. On the other hand, we shall find seals showing a sun-god dependent upon a water-god, and no deity but Marduk will fit such a situation ; nor does this group remain isolated as evidence of Marduk's presence in the mythology of Sargonid times. Now Marduk, even as we know him in the texts, has a curiously inconsistent character; for he combines in his person features of a sun-god with those of a fertility-god, features, therefore, which are mutually exclusive.1 This com- bination is usually explained as due to non-religious causes ; the rise of Babylon from an obscure town to imperial capital is held responsible for a far-reaching identification of various deities with Marduk, who was originally a sun-god and of purely local (Babylonian) significance. But it seems to me difficult to maintain this view. Ravn has shown2 that Marduk's predominance in official inscriptions did not coincide with the sudden rise of Babylon's power under Hammurabi but comes almost a century later, under Ammiditana. And we shall find in the following pages that myths identical with those regarding Marduk in later times seem to be reflected on Sargonid seals, 500 years, that is, before the rise of Marduk's city under Hammurabi. Starting from these observations I have tried to show that we need not attempt to find reasons extraneous to religion to explain the curious blend of features, ultimately incompatible, which go to the making up of Marduk's character. A group of seals of which we possess, fortunately, pre-Sargonid as well as Sargonid examples, suggests that the puzzling combination of characteristics may be due to an interpretation of Sumerian mythology in terms of Semitic beliefs. The Semitic conception of a victorious sun-god (quradu3) became prevalent more as a result of the increase in the Semitic element in the population after the Akkadian conquest than as a result of purposeful theological speculations ; and it penetrated almost imperceptibly into the existing, predominantly chthonic, mythology of the Sumerians. The seals which enable one to follow this progress are discussed in the third section of this paper. 1 The incompatibility of the conception of a sun- god with that of a fertility-god is fully discussed in Baudissin's subtle and penetrating study, Adonis und E?mun, 106 ff., 169 ff. 2 In Acta Orientalia, vu (Leiden, 1928). 3 Contenau in Revue Biblique, 1917, 3.</page><page sequence="6">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 7 As to the scenes which reflect the Babylonian New Year Festival and which are discussed in the fourth section, the fact that some of its ceremonies, or rather, the myths which underlie them, should be figured as designs of good omen on the cylinder seals is hardly astonishing if we remember the funda- mental importance of the festival for the well-being of the whole community and its predominant position in the religious life of the Babylonians. But it is very interesting to note with which kind of texts the seals provide parallels. There are only one or two instances where we are able to refer to Enuma elis. Most of our quotations are from commentaries on the ritual and not from the Epic of Creation. The significance of this circumstance seems to me great; it indicates the limitations of our attempts to explain the seals. The literary form of a myth, even if it is rich in metaphor, is of a very general character indeed as compared with the extreme definition of an image, and therefore the description of a god or of an event can only in exceptional cases be identified with a picture in such a manner that other explanations are excluded beyond a doubt. But the acts of a ritual possess the same precise definition as a picture, and we have, moreover, in the commentaries on the ritual verbal versions of the very symbolism which finds pictorial expression on the seals. It is therefore to ritual texts and not to literary texts that we must look for further material explaining the subjects of the seals. Finally, a few words must be added regarding the dates of the seals dis- cussed in this paper. Most of them are of Sargonid date if we interpret that term widely enough to include the years of Gutium rule when in certain parts of the country, at Lagash under Gudea for instance, the artistic traditions of the dynasty of Akkad continued to prevail.1 But this date provides no argu- ment against assigning a greater age to some of the ideas which the seals embody; in fact we occasionally find pre-Sargonid seals which confirm the early prevalence of beliefs adopted by the Akkadians. And the rarity of such instances need cause no surprise ; for the difference between pre-Sargonid and Sargonid glyptic art consists precisely in the greater importance which the Akkadians attach to the factual content (as opposed to the decorative value) of their designs. This explains why seals with definite religious or mytho- logical subjects are rare in Early Dynastic days, and suddenly become numerous with the advent of the Akkadians, who need not for this reason be considered as the inventors of the myths which they were the first to depict. It is impossible to discuss here the contrast between the two schools of glyptic art ; I have elsewhere indicated a few of the more obvious distinctions2 and shall demonstrate their development in detail when the hundreds of seals from Tell Asmar and Khafajah are published in a separate volume. Since these are well stratified they form an excellent starting-point for a comprehensive survey of the seals of the Early Dynastic and Sargonid periods, and it is on 1 Justification for this procedure is furthermore found in the material discussed by Mr. Sidney Smith, J.R.A.S., 1932, 295 ff., esp. 304. 2 In the Second Preliminary Report of our expedi- tion: Oriental Institute Communications, No. i6, pp. 40-6.</page><page sequence="7">8 H. FRANKFORT the basis of such a survey that I have assigned with assurance, but without giving proofs or arguments, definite dates to the seals discussed in this article. 2. THE SUMERIAN GOD OF FERTILITY The seal cylinders found at Tell Asmar will be discussed here together with other remains from the same strata because, as we have said already, these other monuments have a definite bearing on our subject. We shall therefore first describe the most important features of the newly discovered material. Of the early settlement at Tell Asmar we have so far explored two Sargonid layers and one Early Dynastic.1 In all three strata we found a temple which was almost certainly consecrated to Ab-u, the 'Lord of Vegetation', since a hoard of copper objects dedicated to that god was discovered hidden in the immediate vicinity of the temple and there is no other sanctuary near from which they could be derived. Ab-? serves, in later times, as an epithet for Tammuz as well as for Ninurta.2 In this temple were found two pieces of a limestone stela which depicts a scene not hitherto represented, to my knowledge, in Babylonia, though repeatedly mentioned in inscriptions. On a fleece-covered couch made with legs shaped like those of bulls, a male and female figure are extended with an officiating priest at their feet. The subject is repeated on a cylinder seal found in the Early Dynastic layer of the private houses (Plate I, b) and also on a seal from Khafajah; and it seems certain that we have here the ritual wedding of the god and goddess which forms a well-known element in the fertility cults of many regions.3 In the Sargonid layer of the temple was found the cylinder seal (Plate I, a) which shows two gods attacking a seven-headed Hydra. Four heads hang already limp in death, while three are still raised to strike in defence. Flames arise from the back of the monster, probably representing the means by which it was finally destroyed. Among the neighbouring buildings was discovered, in an Early Dynastic layer of plano-convex bricks, a seal impression showing the earlier form of the Hydra, a coiled serpent with seven heads, attacked by a small figure. The impression is, as usual, fragmentary, but sufficiently clear to prove the pre-Sargonid date of the myth. Finally, we found in the temple, underneath the last rebuilding of the sup- port of the god's statue, the bones of offerings representing the three animal kingdoms. Besides fish-bones and the remains of birds, the frontal bone of 1 See The Times of July ioth, 1933, and the Illu- strated London News of July 15th and 22nd, 1933. 2 Zimmern, Tam?z, 718; Langdon, Sem. Myth., 131 ; Meissner, Bab. u. Ass., 11. 31. 3 The identity of the composition of the group on the seals from Khafajah and Tell Asmar, and on the stela, establishes the scene as a distinct ideogram which should neither be confused with some ob- scene terra-cottas nor with another group of repre- sentations in which Dr. Campbell Thompson sees a rendering of the vampire (Liverpool Annals, xix. 92). This vampire-scene occurs on seals and on a poly- chrome vase from Tepe Musyan, but differs entirely from the one we are here discussing, for the priest standing beside the couch is absent, and the two figures upon it are not stretched side by side but a female figure crouches at some distance above the male one. Mr. Gadd points out to me that the scor- pion underneath the couch in Plate I, fig. b may stand as a symbol for libara. See Campbell Thompson, The Epic of Gilgamesh, 74, on the role of this god- dess. But on the seal from Khafajah there is a dog underneath the couch ; however, as a symbol of Gula, the wife of Ninurta (?Ab-?), it is not inappropriate.</page><page sequence="8">PLATE I (a) Tall Asmar, 32/738 ?t*"t (b) Tall Asmar, 32/934 (c) Back of alabaster group from Tall Asmar</page><page sequence="9">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 9 a goat or gazelle with the horns attached drew our attention ; for throughout the private houses of plano-convex bricks we had noticed clay models of just this same object, a frontal bone with twisted horns, and there was now no doubt but that it symbolized in the private houses the god whose temple we had found. These clay imitations of horns do not occur in the Sargonid levels, but real horns abound throughout ; it is, however, obviously impossible to interpret these as necessarily religious. If we survey in their totality the remains just enumerated we cannot but be struck by the consistency and the homogeneity of the information they impart. All of them exemplify the existence of a fertility cult in which the main deity personifies the generative power of Nature, and his attributes and symbols, and also the rites obtaining in his cult, which we derive from the material found in the private houses, are identical with that found in the temple of Ab-u. We have already noted that the ????? ????? of the stela finds a counterpart on an early seal from the houses; we shall presently discuss a variety of representations on seals which show us the 'Lord of Vegetation' of the temple ; the Hydra-form on the seal (Plate 1, a) from the temple finds no exact counterpart in the houses, but the dragon on the back of the remarkable alabaster group (Plate 1, c) resembles that Hydra sufficiently closely to suggest a connexion; and we shall soon find further evidence in support of the comparison. The alabaster group (Plate 1, c) reveals a god whose head projects above a body covered with scales. This is no doubt a variation of the idea that some seal-cutters expressed when they showed a god whose body, from the waist downward, had the shape of a serpent (Plate 11,0). The sculptor in the round had a more difficult task, but he hid the parts on the obverse, where serious anatomical difficulties might be expected, with the figures of worshippers. On the reverse side of the figure he indicated two animals : a snake and the dragon already mentioned. Now this group supplies an excellent basis for our attempts to connect the anonymous deities of our monuments with literary sources ; for the juxta- position of serpents and dragons occurs on the steatite vase from Lagash, which Gudea dedicated to the god Ningizzida (Fig. i).1 I am aware that it is impossible to prove the identity of the dragon of our alabaster group with the well-defined dragon of Gudea's vase, which is now identified by Mrs. Van Buren in this journal (p. 78) as the 'lion-bird'. But the absence of the 'lion-bird's' distinctive features in PL 1, c, is no proof to the contrary, since it may be due to the coarseness of the sculptor's style. In any case we find on an early seal (Plate v, i) a curious design which shows two dragons of the type of our alabaster group (i.e. without the distinctive marks of the 'lion-bird' of Gudea's vase) drawn with their long necks intertwined so as to form a caduceus-like design, which no doubt symbolizes the god in whose honour the butchering of the animals, shown on the seal, is 1 Jerem?as, Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskulturen, 247, fig. 142, and Weidner in O.L.Z., 1919, 11 ff.</page><page sequence="10">?? ?. FRANKFORT undertaken. This seal reaffirms, therefore, the close association of caduceus and dragon (an association which we shall discuss presently). It furthermore seems to justify our assumption that the 'lion-bird' of Gudea's vase and the type of dragon of our alabaster group refer to the same monster and that the snake-god of the group represents Ningizzida. As to the further identification of our dragon with the Hydra, we know that this monster was sometimes figured with a single head by the ancients. Returning to Gudea's vase, there is no doubt that the entwined serpents represent here the god,1 the dragons appearing in the purely subservient position of attendants or, more pre- cisely, of guardians at the gate of the sanctuary, which is rendered in abbreviation by two archaic door- posts,2 just as the god himself is only indicated by the caduceus. Other gods are often accompanied by minor deities, such as bull-men, or the naked long-haired figures usually dubbed 'Gilgamesh', in exactly the same func- tion as the dragons on Gudea's vase occupy (Plate iv, b). These are one of the various sets of 'twins', as Ebeling has shown when publishing a plaque with one of the long-haired figures grasping the archaic door-post; and, for once, this figure could be identified by its inscription.3 While the dragon appears on Gudea's vase, and on the back of our alabaster group, as the adjunct of the main deity, we find the Hydra on the seal Plate I, a in the position of adversary. Now it seems that the adjuncts of gods are often nothing but vanquished opponents. Thus we find, for instance, that the bull-men appear in either relation with the sun-god.4 And again we find Fig. i 1 Heidenreich has recently published (Z.A., N.F. vil) a seal which belongs to the Jamdat Nasr period, and upon which we find a deity indicated by a mere symbol, so that the usage which prevails on the Kudurru has an immemorial tradition behind it which is also manifest in the Gudea vase. 2 This is shown to be the meaning of the 'Biigel- schafV by Andrae, Das Gotteshaus und die Urfor- men des Bauens im alten Orient, 55 f. So also Con- TENAU, Manuel, 11. 588 f. 3 A.f.O. v. 219. The identity in type and func- tion of the 'twin' from the plaque and those from seals like our Plate iv, b relieves us of the necessity of identifying them with any of the well-known gods who are sometimes referred to as twins, whom Ebeling enumerates. The seals show that the twins are entirely subsidiary figures and therefore probably nameless. Heidenreich, Beitr?ge zur Geschichte der vorderasiatischen Steinschneidekunst, 24, refers to Ningizzida and Tammuz, mentioned as twin-guards in the Adapa myth, because he sees Tammuz in the locked and bearded nude figure. The evidence for that identification, however, is very frail ; and it cer- tainly seems impossible to identify the * twins' in their subservient position with those two important deities. But Heidenreich's evidence makes it prob- able that the nude figures with hair in locks were considered 'sons of Ea\ 4 Commonly as standard-bearer or foot-rest of the sun-god in the Hammurabi dynasty. Instances enumerated by Prinz, Altorientalische Symbolik, 91 (cf. 60) and 98.

The identification of Ningizzida with the constellation Hydra1 would, on this assumption, find an exact parallel in the identification of Ninurta, the con- queror of the storm-god Zu, with Aquila.2 If this line of thought leads us to consider the victorious god of Plate I, a as Ningizzida, there is a possible alternative explanation, assuming that Meissner is right in his assertion3 that the constellation Hydra represents, in another text, the monster Labbu; and since Ninurta is mentioned in various texts as the conqueror of Labbu, he also has a claim to be the god represented in Plate I, ?z, the more so as Ab-?&gt; the god of the temple where the seal was found, is a title of Ninurta.4 But Fig. 2 Fig. 3 our dilemma is more apparent than real, for we shall soon see that Ninurta and Ningizzida are but different epithets of the same deity in his aspects of warrior and hunter, on the one hand, and of earth-god and god of fertility on the other. For the presence of Ningizzida at Eshnunna there is good evidence.5 The caduceus appears on two seal impressions (Fig. 2).6 In Fig. 3 we notice two snakes rising from the god's legs. There is extant an omen text stating that a child born with a head like a serpent is an omen sent by Ningizzida.7 There is no need, then, to see presentations of this god only in the few instances in which the caduceus appears ; the serpent itself may surely indicate the same god, and especially the serpent with the human head. For thus the deity of our alabaster group is figured and we have shown that there is little doubt as to his identity. In the house chapel where the alabaster group was found, we found also a large pot of a common type resembling a soup-tureen with a tubular spout, but in this case it showed on the shoulder the figure of a snake applied in clay, a feature never found elsewhere. Here the snake no doubt indicates that the pot was dedicated to the ritual of the god of the alabaster group which was found next to it. It is an important link with the god wor- shipped in the temple which we found, that there also we discovered a frag- ment of a pot with a snake applied to its surface. We may make yet another observation about the snake-god; it seems that often two snakes appear as his symbol. This is the case in the caduceus and 1 Langdon, Ishtar and Tammuz, 116, ?. ?, quoting CT. 33, 2, Rev. 8: '(Star) Hydra =(god) Ningiz- zida, Lord of the earth.' 2 Langdon, Sem.

In a pre-Sargonid seal (Plate 11, b) we have, to my mind, a representation of the same god, and two snakes are shown entwining above him. In seals dating from the First Babylonian Dynasty the figure of the god appears entwined by the two snakes.1 Now the caduceus is such a well-known device that one is apt to take it for granted without inquiring into its meaning. But Dr. Campbell Thompson once suggested to me that it might represent two snakes copulating, and this suggestion is confirmed to me in a letter from Mr. H. W. Parker, Assistant Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum of Natural History, from which I am grateful to quote the following: ? do not think there is any doubt that the symbol in which you are interested may well represent two snakes pairing. As a general rule the male seizes the female by the back of the neck and the two bodies are more or less intertwined. . . . Vipers . . . are said to have the body completely intertwined.'2 This, then, explains most satisfactorily why the caduceus should have become the symbol of our god who is thus characterized as the personification of the generative force in Nature, and why it is not a single snake but a couple which appear with him in Fig. 3 and Plate 11, ?.3 The identity of the snake-god with the deity symbolized by the caduceus is further corroborated by the evidence of the altar with rising flames, which is not at all common on Sargonid seals but which appears almost always in front of the snake-god, and is also shown in Fig. 2, where the god is identified by the caduceus. On a seal in Berlin4 flames actually arise from the snake- 1 Mrs. Van Buren, in this journal pp. 74-5. 2 Mr. Parker refers to a figure on p. 722 of Schreiber, Herpetologia Europaea. 3 It is very interesting to note that the fertility-god of Plate 11, b drinks through a tube from a large vessel. Now we have found just such a tube in a hoard of vessels, lamps, &amp;c, which are identical in form with those from the so-called Royal Tombs of Ur, but are, at Eshnunna, parts of a temple service dedicated in an inscription to the ' Lord of Vegeta- tion*. And a similar jar, with three drinking-tubes standing in it, is pictured in the scenes of the divine connubium (Plate 1, b). All this evidence supports the view of Mr. Smith (J.R.A.S., 1928, 849 ff.) and of Professor Bohl (Z.A., N.F. v. 83 ff.) that the interments at Ur do not represent royal burials at all, but contain victims of a ritual connected with the god of fertility; exceptional possibly because some special circumstance, such as a famine, or the founding of a new state temple, made it essential to achieve the highest efficacy, only obtainable through the actual sacrifice of human life. The main actors would then be the 'Meskalamdug', no doubt the priest who acted the god for the king in the fatal ritual, and the divine bride. It has not, to my knowledge, been noted that Meskalamdug and Meskalamduglugal were each buried high up in the shaft of a separate tomb which at least in the case of the latter contained that of an adorned woman, who would be the adorned bride. For Mes- kalamdug see Fig. 1 on p. 421 of AJ. vinj'for Meskalamduglugal see AJ. ix. 314 and pi. xxix. It would seem likely then that the name of the male actor was only an epithet which he bore in the ritual drama; and if this can be translated, as has been suggested, 'Warrior of the Nether World', we shall see that this title is perfectly in keeping with certain myths which have influenced the ritual of the New Year's Festival as known in later times (but which our seals allow us to trace back to the period of Sar- gon of Akkad) when the king is identified with the warrior Ninurta who avenges his father (ebeling, Tod und Leben, 36, 11. 20-2). The union of Nin- girsu and Bau took place on New Year's Day accord- ing to Gudea, Statue G, 5 ; Cylinder ? describes, as Bohl has seen, a ceremony such as may have been the occasion of the interments at Ur. The associa- tion of the jars and drinking tubes with the connu- bium which we see in Plate 1, b finds its explanation from the same text. After the union in Cylinder ? 5, ii f. 'the Anunnaki of Lagash, together with the lord Ningirsu, feasted in that place' (after Barton). And similarly, when a renewed union of Bau and Ningirsu had caused satisfactorily to grow all that was needful for the city and the temple (in 17, 2 ff.) we read that Gudea rejoiced and provided drink and food. It may well be that the prevalence, on Early Dynastic cylinders, of the feasting scene in which two people are shown drinking through tubes refers specifically to the feast held after the connubium of the gods which was thought to be of such a pre- dominant importance for the well-being of the community. 4 Weber, 392.</page><page sequence="13">PLATE II (b) Morgan, 35 (a) Tall Asmar, 32/646 (c) Biblioth?que Nationale, 67 (d) Tall Asmar, 31/562 (h) Biblioth?que Nationale, 79 (g) P.S.?.?., xiv, 7 (0 M.

We may well recall here that Professor Langdon, who long ago saw Ningizzida in the serpent-god of the seals, has pointed out that his name is sometimes Sahan which means 'fire'. His other name Serah meaning 'grain', 'vegetation', indicates a con- nexion with the earth's fertility, a well-known characteristic of snake-gods in general, confirmed in our case by several instances, where the snake-god is depicted in connexion with sprouting plants (Plate 11, a) or actually holds plants in his hands.1 On a seal from Tell Asmar he actually appears with a goddess, both figures grasping plants. The position of the serpent corre- sponds here exactly with that of the 'Lord of Vegetation' in Plate 11, e and Plate in, a. This aspect of Ningizzida as 'Lord of Vegetation' is well repre- sented in the texts, where he is often brought in close relationship with Tammuz,2 or is mentioned with other gods of flocks and grain.3 An indubitable 'Lord of Vegetation' appears as the only completed figure on an unfinished seal found in the Sargonid houses at Tell Asmar (Plate 11, e). Similar figures generally appear as minor deities doing homage to a goddess of vegetation (group II) (Plate 11, / and g). Langdon is no doubt right in seeing in these figures images of Tammuz and the mother-goddess. It is interesting to note that in the best seals of this group care has been taken to vary the plants which emerge from the body of Tammuz (Plate n&gt;g) so that the interpretation as God of Grain4 is certainly incorrect. More interesting for our purpose are the seals in which the god of fertility does not appear as a minor figure but as the main deity (group III) (Plate 11, /?, i). His adjunct is then a ram or an ibex which generally, as in Plate 11, i, stands behind his throne, but which in Plate il, h puts his foot on the knee of its master in an attempt to reach the oats (?) in his hand, a gesture which vividly contrasts its intimate relation to the god with that of the animals brought as offerings by his worshippers. It is obvious from these seals that we should be mistaken in considering this god as a deity of vegetation alone ; that his iconography shows consistently plants and rams or goats together, clearly proves that he is considered a god of fertility, exactly in the same way as Tammuz is called a 'shepherd' or 'Lord of the Sheep-folds' as frequently as he is lord of plants.5 On a seal in 1 e.g. As.

Further proof of a relationship (which to my mind derives from original identity) between Tammuz and Ningizzida will be found in Mrs. van Buren 's article in this journal, viz. Ningizzida's marital relation with Geshtinanna and the use of the name Umunmuzida for Tammuz. 3 Langdon, Sem. Myth., 104. 'He (Anu) created the corn-goddess the goddess of flocks and wine, Ningiszid, Ninsar ... as those who enrich the fixed sacrifices.' 4 Legrain, MJ., 1929, interprets as Ashnan the corresponding figure of No. 77 on pi. xxxvi. 5 The same conjunction of plants and goats appears on the 'Kultrelief' from Ashur published by Andrae (W.V.D.O.G., No. 53). Mrs. van Buren, Flowing Vase, 102-4, mav weU De right in seeing in the figure of the main god 'Tammuz', if we take this name simply as the most widely spread desig- nation of the fertility-god with whom we are dealing in this section of our article. This does not exclude at all the possibility that he represents Ashur whose characteristics include many of the same nature which need not be due to borrowings from Marduk, but may, in the case of Ashur as in that of Marduk, belong to the oldest elements in the composite character of those gods. See Sidney Smith in J.E.A. vu 1 (1922), 41 ff., and Bulletin of the School of Orien- tal Languages, iv. 70 ff. It seems to me that Tall-</page><page sequence="15">i4 H. FRANKFORT Berlin the plough is held by a god behind whom we find a mountain covered with plants as well as the ibex of Plate n, i.1 And Ningirsu, who was certainly also a divinity of vegetation and irrigation and who had a field near Lagash where all sorts of plants flourished,2 was the child of a she-goat.3 The notion that one and the same deity caused the growth of crops and the increase of herds is, moreover, shown to go back to very early times by a magnificent seal cylinder just published by Andrae4 and dateable on the strength of Heiden- reich's argument5 and recent work at Warka to the Jamdat Nasr period. Our seals now enable us to trace this god of fertility in certain scenes of a more complicated character which provide links with the literary tradition of later times. In the first place he is undoubtedly to be seen in the left-hand figure on the remarkable seal from the collection of the late Lord Southesk (Plate in, a) which was published by Ball.6 Ears of corn rise from his shoul- ders, the ram jumping up against its master is identical with that of Plate p, A, and the god's attitude, facing the goddess of vegetation on a footing of absolute equality, forms a contrast with the seals of which Plate p,/ and g are examples (group. II), but their positions are similar in Plate p, e} where the figure of the goddess is not completed but the ears of corn are at least outlined in her hands. The figure of the god of fertility in Plate in, a, however, has several novel features. He seems to be in possession of all the attributes of Herakles: the bow, the club, and the lion's skin. The paws dangling from the skin in Plate in, a are identical with those of the monster, half-lion, half- human, which is attacked by the right-hand god in Plate p?, b. Now the texts know of a lion-like monster, Labbu7, and his conqueror is Ninurta. It may seem strange to bring a god who is pre-eminently the god of war in later times into connexion with the peasant gods which we review in this section. But we have said already that one of Ninurta's titles is Ab-? ; there is a myth in which it is definitely said of Ninurta: 'And the plants with one accord named him as their king';8 and in Plate ni, a we see a figure which precisely unites the attributes of the hunter and warrior with those of a god of fertility. Independent evidence that the god with the bow is Ninurta will be found in the third part of this paper. In fact a yet more unexpected embodiment of our god of fertility appears in the left-hand figure of the two fleece-clad deities of Plate in, c. He is accompanied by the identical animal which is seen in Plate in, a. And his qvist's objections to this view (Der Assyrische Gott, no f.) are vitiated by the fact that all texts refer- ring to Ashur are late and that the character of State- god in the case of Marduk also causes a relegation to the background of 'Tammuz* characteristics. 1 Weber 440. Dr. A. Moortgat, of the Vorder- asiatische Abteilung, Berlin Museum, has been so kind as to verify for me that the seat of the god ends behind in an animal's head ; the design is not clear enough to decide whether it is the head of a serpent or that of the * lion-bird' ; he inclines, with reserve, to the latter view. The god of fertility of our group III seems in any case on this cylinder to be identi- ned with the Ningizzida of our group I. 2 Deimel, Pantheon, 202. 3 Gudea, Cyl.

That this is so, and that we should on no account connect the bird with the other executioner, is plainly shown by a Tell Asmar cylinder Plate in, dy where a group is composed in exactly the same manner. In Plate in, c the victim is an anthropomorphic god to whom a bird is added to indicate his nature, but in Plate in, d the victim is the bird itself. I believe that these seals depict the victory of Ninurta over the storm-bird Zu.1 In weighing the value of the argument that the identity of the composition of the scenes in Plate in, c and d proves an identity of subject it is of the greatest importance to remember that in all religious art there is the closest possible correlation between the subject-matter and the manner in which it is rendered. This applies to ancient oriental art as well as to that of the Middle Ages or the Far East. The consistent use of definite groupings and attributes for certain known personages and situations is the very language by which the pictures can be understood. If we remember this, the grouping of figures in Plate in, c becomes highly significant. Many Sargonid seals show gods fighting, but they are always placed in pairs. The group of three, a victim and two executioners, is to my knowledge only found on two other seals besides Plate in, ?, namely that of Plate in, d and one seal in the Southesk collection, where the victim is also a bird (Ward, 126). There can be no doubt that the same subject is rendered in all three cases. A seal impression in Philadelphia2 and a seal in the Morgan Library, Plate v,^ show the victim in human shape as in our Plate in, c, while the victorious god is accompanied by his own emblem, the lion-headed eagle Imgi. We shall see (p. 27 below) in studying the groups X, XIII, and XIV that the presence of Ea in these scenes suggests that the victim is here, again, Zu and his conqueror Ninurta. The identity of the victor is, moreover, disclosed by the independent evidence of his emblem, since Thureau-Dangin has shown that the lion-headed eagle is the symbol of Ningirsu, the early form of Ninurta, especially at Lagash.3 We may well recall here that the ceremony pictured on the stela from our Ab-u temple and in Plate 1, b is mentioned in the texts as performed by Ningirsu4 who, as we have already stated, is a god of fertility and irrigation as well as the god of war, identical with Ninurta but also closely related with Tammuz.5 The lion-headed eagle Imgi occurs furthermore at Tell Asmar as a pendant three times in a hoard of Sargonid jewellery found in the building adjoining the temple of Ab-? ; and since it is nowhere else used in this way, as far as I know, it is perhaps not too bold to surmise that the wearer of the jewellery belonged to the personnel of the ad- joining temple and that Imgi was a symbol of the god worshipped there.6 1 Ninurta as conqueror of Zu: Zimmern, Zum Bab.

FRANKFORT These, then, are the gods which we were led to consider in studying the material from Tell Asmar: Ab-?y Ningizzida, Ninurta or Ningirsu, and Tammuz. Yet it seems certain that the public worship of the community whose houses and temple we excavated was not addressed to such a multitude of deities. The temple of Ab-u offers accommodation for but one statue ; and the evidence from the houses which cluster round this temple reflects in every aspect the ideas suggested by the objects discovered within it, as we have seen at the beginning of this section. Farther towards the south, but some con- siderable distance away, we believe that there was a Tishpak temple in the Larsa period and this temple may possibly go back to an earlier foundation. Even if this were not so, we should have no wish to support Langdon's con- tention that the Sumerians were monotheists in the beginning, for it is certain that the female principle, and probably, as we shall see, the sun also, were con- sidered separate deities. But it is a far cry from these ascertained facts which point to the worship of four or five deities to an extreme form of polytheism such as we should have to postulate if each divine name in the texts corre- sponded with a separate god. And the consistency of the material from the temple and the houses at Tell Asmar, considered in conjunction with the many characteristics which the gods whom we have studied possess in common, and the links which connect various epithets and traits in their mythology, all the material, in short, which we have surveyed so far, goes to show that Ningiz- zida, Ninurta, Ningirsu, Ab-u&gt; Dumuzi, were not in reality separate deities in the Early Dynastic and Sargonid periods. Their names, of course, are not proper names but epithets. And nothing is more natural than that the importance attached to the various aspects of one deity should vary from place to place and that, consequently, the epithet by which he is habitually referred to should equally differ in the different localities. Support for this view is found in what little we know about the god who in later times was considered the lord of Eshnunna. Tishpak was originally, as Dr. Jacobsen has shown,1 the Human deity Teshub, who was introduced in Eshnunna at the latest during the dynasty of Akkad.2 Dr. Jacobsen has also shown that he took the place of Ninazu in the temple called E-sikil, and inscribed bricks of Shulgi found during our subsequent season have com- pletely confirmed his contention.3 It should be noted that Ninazu's name is, again, an epithet; whether we may combine him with the gods discussed above it is difficult to say, at least so long as the earlier layers of E-sikil are not excavated. That Ninazu stands in close relation with Tammuz is known4 and he counts as Ningizzida's father. But on the seal which Kirikiri gave to his son5 we find Tishpak figured with the symbols of Ningizzida; that Tishpak is the god represented on the seal follows from the long dedicatory inscription to that god;6 on the other hand, a stela and a seal cylinder 1 Oriental Institute Communications, 13, 51 ff. 2 Oriental Institute Communications, 13, 58, ?. 2 must not read, of course, 'Hardly before', but 'Hardly after the Dynasty of Akkad for the personal name Tishpakkum occurs on an unpublished tablet (now in Chicago) of that period'. 3 Oriental Institute Communications, 16, 53 ff. 4 Zimmern, Tam?z, 716 f. 5 Oriental Institute Communications, 13, 19, fig. 14. 6 Jacobsen, loc. cit., 42 ff.</page><page sequence="18">PLATE 111 (a) Ball, Light from the East, 15 (b) Biblioth?que Nationale, 68 (d) Tall Asmar, 32/84 (c) P.S.B.A., xiv, ?

And finally the place assigned to Tishpak in the myth of Labbu identifies him with Ninurta. Thus it seems that we must conceive the Sumerians at Eshnunna (and else- where) as having worshipped as one of their main deities a god who personi- fied the generative force of Nature and was therefore manifest in the fertility of the soil and of the flocks, who lived in the nether world and often assumed the shape of a serpent, who was exposed to dangerous encounters but suc- ceeded in vanquishing monsters, and whose connubium with a goddess was an essential part of the annual ritual. If he was invoked by varying epithets, these do not seem to have obliterated, in the third millennium at least, the consciousness of his one and single individuality. Thus late theological speculation which ultimately worked towards a simplification of the Baby- lonian pantheon by treating originally independent deities as aspects of the same god, must, at an earlier stage, have itself created much of the multi- plicity which it subsequently combated, by establishing as separate deities what originally were but aspects of one god. 3. THE SUN-GOD The many-sided Sumerian deity whom we have studied in the foregoing pages is by no means all embracing in his potentialities. Solar connexions in particular are absent. And since on some very important seals which we shall study in the fourth section of this paper, a figure clearly marked as a sun-god plays a predominant part, it is as well to consider here what early evidence we have concerning him. It is not without significance that the general name for the sun-god in Babylonia is the Semitic word Shamash. Though it is certain that the Sumerians worshipped a sun-god, he does not seem to have been such a prominent figure amongst the gods as his Semitic counterpart no doubt became. It seems, in fact, that the Semites not only introduced Shamash into the Babylonian pantheon but that they imparted solar characteristics to the indigenous god of fertility whom they adopted. The process may have been largely unconscious, for there were a number of features shared by both classes of deity, and the myths and beliefs in which these features predomin- ated would naturally be attributed by Semites to a sun-god while they applied in reality to a chthonic deity. It is clear, for instance, that the yearly death and revival of the vegetation finds a parallel in the decrease and increase of the sun's power through the cycle of the seasons, and even in its daily rising and setting; and the symbolical connexion of the god's vicissitudes with human life and death obtrudes itself equally in either case. We have evidence that this argument is correct. There is a text published I The cylinder in DE SARZEc, Decouvertes en Chaldie, I. 293; the stela in SCHAFER-ANDRAE, Die Kunst des alten Orients, 474. See this journal, Plate xi, c. c</page><page sequence="20">?8 H. FRANKFORT by Dr. Campbell Thompson, describing the kiskanu tree, which, rooted in the nether world, is said to be: In an undefiled dwelling, like a forest grove, Its shade spreadeth abroad, and none may enter in. In its depth (are) Shamash and Tammuz. It seems impossible to explain the conjunction in which these two gods appear here as due to any other train of thought than this, that they alone, each in his own way, pass through the nether world, through death, in fact, and reappear alive.1 Other features of the sun, the regularity of its apparent movements, the omnipresence of its rays, established this deity with the Semites as well as with the Sumerians, as the protector of the existing order and therefore as supreme judge. And it is very important to note that it is as such that he appears in pre-Sargonid texts. When Eannatum states that he 'cast the net of Utu' over the wicked men of Umma who had trespassed over a solemnly estab- lished boundary, the moralizing tenor of his text shows beyond doubt that the sun is considered here in the first place as judge and not as warrior, though it would obviously be wrong to insist too much on a strict separation of judicial and executive powers in so early a period. This matter is of great importance when we study the seals, in the next section, which show the sun-god van- quishing his enemies : for it seems that the conception of the sun as a victorious warrior (quradu) was especially favoured by the Semites. Before we discuss those seals, however, it is useful to consider another group in which the sun-god appears seated in a boat. For here we are fortu- nate enough to possess specimens both of Akkadian and of pre-Sargonid date, and we may hope to derive from their comparison some inkling of the differ- ence between the Semitic and the Sumerian conceptions of the god. The main idea of the scene is apparent (Plate p?, e-g). The sun steers a boat through the waters of the underworld over which he must pass during the night;2 the chthonic connexions, presently to be examined, exclude the 1 R. Campbell Thompson, Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia, i. 200 ff. Tablet K, 11. 183-95. On pp. liii ff. of the same work the passage is discussed in full, mainly with references to various attempts, fashionable at the time, to read in it a description of the Garden of Eden. We may well admit that these attempts have failed, and that kifkanu refers to a plant used as medicine for a sick man (ibid., p. lix) ; but that does not imply that kiSkanu is 'never used with a mythological meaning*. As medicine it is gathered by three minor gods of Eridu ; but in the preceding lines of the text, which form our quota- tion, its mythological prototype and the place where it is to be found are described. And in this descrip- tion the point which interests us above all is how Shamash and Tammuz came to be mentioned here together. Incidentally an allusion to the victory over death won by Tammuz and Shamash each in his own way would be most appropriate in a magical text dealing with medicine. 2 The main figure in the boat is characterized as a sun-god by the flames rising from his shoulders. One might think of the moon-god, who, as Dr. Campbell Thompson has shown, was thought to be travelling through the sky in a boat. But in the first place there is no instance of which I know, in which the moon-god is represented with rays rising from his shoulders. And in the second place our god holds in one instance the saw with which the sun-god 'cuts decisions' (Weber 406; VA 2952; on the saw, Meissner, in M.V.A.G., IX. 234). Since few pre-Sargonid seals are pictured in this article it is perhaps not superfluous to point out that the god in the boat of Plate m, g does not wear the crescent on his head, but that this is the normal way in which the horned crown of the gods is rendered on pre-Sargonid seals. It is true that in Plate in, g moon and stars appear above the boat, but this merely shows that the sun-god's journey 'during the night' is depicted. It is obviously impossible to express</page><page sequence="21">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 19 supposition that we see here the waters of the sky. The boat is thought to move of its own accord, a notion for which pictorial expression is not easily found. The ingenious solution adopted in our seals shows the prow of the boat in a semi-human shape, so that two hands and sometimes one foot are available to manage the punting-pole. The stern of the boat ends in a serpent's head in Plate in, /. Within there is a human-headed lion tied to the stern, a small rectangular object, a pot with a spout and handle, another object with a domed top and a flower or some other vegetable above, and finally a plough. I do not know of another seal that shows the accessories so clearly, but some of them are evidently established requisites since they recur in every instance, pre-Sargonid and Sargonid alike, of which I know. These are the plough, the pot, and the quadruped. In our Plate in, g the vase is shown above the animal, as it is in most of these seals, and in some it has the shape of the 'pilgrim-bottle', of which we found actual examples in a Sar- gonid layer at Tell Asmar.1 The bird of the Khafajah seal (Plate m,?) recurs perhaps on a Sargonid cylinder seal from Tell Asmar (As. '31-25); this, in any case, shows the quadruped with the dragon's head, and that seems also to be the case on a pre-Sargonid seal from Khafajah (Kh. II. 276). I am there- fore inclined to consider as a connected scene our Plate in, A, another Sargonid seal from Tell Asmar, which shows the plough, the dragon, a lion, and the bird engaged in action on some heavenly field. We should add that at least in two instances the plough shown with the sun-god's boat also ends in some sort of centipede body.2 I do not pretend either to understand the seal of Plate m, h or the meaning of the accessories of the sun-god's vessel, but it seems an apt illustration of the opening line of the incantation : 'The astral Ploughman has yoked in the Plain (of Heaven) the seed-sowing Plough.'3 And in any case it seems to strengthen the evidence of the boat-seals that those accessories render not merely milestones along the road, constellations through which the sun-god passes. It seems that they are in some more inti- mate way connected with the sun-god's progress. That is evident in the case of the quadruped, who appears as a captive, tied to the prow of the boat in Plate in,/. To that particular detail we shall presently return. What strikes one in this series of seals is the extraordinary prevalence of symbols which are directly related to the god of fertility studied in the first section of this paper. There is not only the plough, which often appears in a prominent position on seals where a god of vegetation is shown ;4 but we find on several of these boat-seals branches or bundles of plants,5 and in addition there the notion which I have put between quotation- marks in any other way. That the sun passes dur- ing the night through the earth or through waters underneath the earth is, of course, a widely spread idea. 1 Illustrated London News, July 15th, 1933, 97, fig. 3, and Sidney Smith, Historical Texts, Frontis- piece, fig. 4, and pp. 72 ff. * Khafajah ??-276 and VA 2952 (Weber 406). 3 After Gadd, in Myth and Ritual. . ., edited by S.

I should be loath to connect this figure with the main scene on the seal, especially as she occurs on another Sargonid seal as mere space-filling ornament,1 but there are equivalent personages on two other seals with the sun-boat: one from Tell Asmar shows a god apparently carrying an ear of corn in either hand (Plate in, e)y and a seal published by Mr. Sidney Smith depicts two bird-men with ears of corn following the sun-god in his boat.2 The boat itself ends in an ear of corn on the seal from Tell Asmar which we have just mentioned, and this substitution of plants for the serpent's head of Plate in,/3 shows once more that the conception expressed on these seals fits entirely into the body of be- liefs which we studied in the preceding chapter of this paper as centring round the pre-Sargonid god of fertility. Perhaps we have to deal here with a 'sun of the earth' such as we find with the Hittites,4 who thus refer to the sun-god in his passage from west to east through the lower regions during the night, a notion which is elaborately developed in Egypt. But in the case of the Sumerian scenes with the sun-boat it is clear that not merely an indication of the sun's passage underground is intended. It is the generative power of Nature as manifest in plant life and especially in agriculture (the plough) which seems intimately related with the sun-god during his nightly journey ; and it is thus that the Sumerian sun-god and the deities discussed in the pre- ceding section appear as creations of the same religious consciousness. The combination, on these seals, of a voyaging sun-god with attributes which point to the earth and its produce is thrown into relief by the total absence of such associations in all other Akkadian scenes in which the sun-god figures. These are very common in Sargonid times, and in the large majority of cases the god is shown rising above the eastern mountains; sometimes 'twin' attendants open the gates of heaven for his entrance, sometimes a worshipper has himself included in the scene. Less frequent are scenes in which the sun, enthroned, receives the worship of one or more fellow gods. All these scenes are without prototypes of pre-Sargonid date, and neither a plough, nor plants, nor gods carrying ears of corn are shown in them. Since such symbols occur in all the instances where the sun-boat is pictured, in other words, in all the versions of a representation which the Akkadians took over from their predecessors, it seems that we have touched here upon the very point in which the Sumerian conception of the sun differed from that of the Akkadians : the Sumerian sun-god was closely allied to the gods dis- cussed above, and intimately related therefore with the earth and its fertility, a connexion which occupies only a secondary place in Semitic beliefs. It is not yet possible to specify in what manner this close connexion was understood by the Sumerians, but we may conclude the argument by quoting a text which, if it does not perhaps explain the connexion in detail, at least gives it graphic expression. After Gudea has had a vision in a dream, the 1 MJ., 1929, pi- xxi, 54- 2 See p. 19, ?. ?, above. 3 It is extremely interesting to note that similarly the seat of the fertility-god on the seal, Weber 440 (see above, p. 14) ends in a serpent's or dragon's head. 4 See Tenner, in Z.A., N.F. iv, 1929, 186 ff.; G?tze, Kleinasien, in Iwan M?ller's Handbuch der klasnschen Altertumswissenschaft, in. 1. 3; p. 130.</page><page sequence="23">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 21 mother-goddess explains to him its various parts. She says (Cyl. A, 5, 19 ff., after Barton) : 'The sun which rose from the fruitful earth is thy god Ningizzida who like the sun rises for thee from out of the earth. ' If we remember that Ningizzida is often represented in the form of a snake and as such constantly associated with fire (see above) the appropriateness of the simile is evident. Whether the statement as a whole means that Ningizzida is identified with the sun is another matter. Generally it is so considered; and in all the other 'visions' there is, indeed, identity between what is actually seen and what it is said to represent. But Deimel objects that this identifica- tion of Ningizzida with the sun would stand all by itself,1 and that therefore we have to translate Utu rather as 'glare', a proposal well in keeping with the seals to which we have just now referred. On the other hand, we now have Kirikiri's seal (Plate x, b) on which Tishpak, in the guise of Ningizzida, is accompanied by the symbol of Shamash, the solar disk. Since this seal, how- ever, dates from the early years of the Larsa period, it is possible that it repre- sents that peculiar attribution of solar characteristics to chthonic gods and gods of fertility which we have considered a consequence of the Semitic predominance under the dynasty of Akkad It is not impossible even that the influence of that same predominance is responsible for the inclusion of the vision in Gudea's dream. Even so its graphic qualities render it invalu- able as an aid in our understanding of the connexion which, as the boat- scenes prove, existed in the mind of the Sumerians between the sun and the 'fruitful earth'. 4. MARDUK The last groups of Sargonid seals to be interpreted raise more problems than they solve. But these seem to show, in any case, that some of the most important beliefs which underlie the New Year Festival in New Babylonian times, and could heretofore be traced back, at most, to the period of Ham- murabi, existed already under the dynasty of Sargon of Akkad. We may well begin this part of the inquiry by returning to a feature in the boat-seals which is to be directly connected with the sun-god's most typical attributes in later times. The quadruped, generally shown as a monster with a human head and a lion's body, has evidently been captured by the god. In Plate in,/, the most detailed rendering of the scene, he is clearly tied to the prow of the boat, and this circumstance suggests that it is with intent that some of the pre-Sargonid seal-cutters show the head of the monster touching the boat's end.2 In other instances, however, the quadruped, which is always present, is placed outside the boat and the casual and varied treatment of the relation between god and monster suggests that it played but a subordinate part in the mythology of the early periods. A greater contrast with the myths of later times which have come down to us cannot well be imagined. 1 Pantheon, p. 204. 2 Khafajah II-276; III-279; Mackay, Report on the Excavation of the *A* Cemetery at Kish (Chicago, 1925), Part I, pi. vi, 15, 17; and our Plate in, g.</page><page sequence="24">22 H. FRANKFORT Professor Wensinck, studying 'The Semitic New Year and the origin of EschatologyV has pointed out how the battle and victory cf the sun is part and parcel of 'the dramatic conception which takes the place of natural law and sees everywhere strife between the cosmic and chaotic powers'. If in later times this conquering aspect of the sun-god preponderates in Mesopo- tamia, the early cylinders show the sun surrounded by chthonic symbols amongst which the monster which he captured occupies none too prominent a place. These seals provide us therefore with a concrete example of the pro- cess, discussed above, by which the Semites could, by a mere shifting of stress and relative value, fundamentally change conceptions which they had taken over from their predecessors in the country and which might seem at first glance, and no doubt appeared to them, common to both communities from the beginning. In the 'Epic of Creation' the idea of the victorious sun-god is supreme. Not so, however, in the New Year Festival. For the comment on the ritual pre- served in a text from the city of Ashur shows that at a certain period of the feast Marduk was confined in the 'mountain', which stands for the underworld and for death, and that he is liberated with the help of others. In this respect he recalls rather the passive Sumerian god called Tammuz, Lillu, and so on, than the invincible hero of Semitic mythology. Yet the syncretism which alone can account for the combination in the person of one god, of two characters which are in the last resort incompatible, is not a product of late theological speculation for it finds clear expression in some Sargonid seals. In the first place it deserves notice that the victor on those seals which depict battles is sometimes marked as a sun-god but not consistently so. Thus we see the Hydra killed by gods without rays (Plate I, ?), but the lionlike monster of Plate in, b is conquered by a sun-god; yet a skin with lion's paws, drawn in exactly the same manner, is worn in Plate in, a by a god who has not rays but ears of corn coming from his shoulders. The variations are exactly what we should suspect if Sumerian myths were rendered sometimes in their original form, and sometimes as if they referred to solar deities. It might seem at first that the occurrence of Marduk in Akkadian times is well established through Plate p, c. For there the victor, though not charac- terized as sun-god, is accompanied by 'the dragon of Babylon'. But we have seen that the dragon is originally connected with Ningizzida or Ninurta, and thus may have belonged from the beginning to the Sumerian elements which went to form the composite figure of Marduk. Not only the seal of Plate ?, a, but also that of Plate n, d shows Ningizzida as the victorious antagonist. For the serpent in Plate n, d must surely be interpreted as a symbol of that god (see Figs. 2 and 3). We shall presently find that Marduk does indeed seem to take his place on Sargonid seals, but it is not as a victor in battle that we can prove his presence. The vanquished god is equally difficult to identify. Opitz2 has published a remarkable Sargonid seal which shows on the left a group of gods building In Acta Orientalia, i. 155-98. 2 A.f.O., vi, pi. m, 2.</page><page sequence="25">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 23 a high monumental structure and on the right a kneeling deity being sub- dued by another ; Opitz remarks that in the sixth tablet of the Epic of Creation Kingu is killed and a palace for Marduk is erected, and that consequently the victim of the fight may be Kingu. As we shall see, there is evidence to support this view, but Opitz's argument is hardly conclusive. For the group of the kneeling and standing god is very common and occurs in combination with a number of other scenes ; and it seems to me an open question whether one may assume that the different subjects on one seal are necessarily con- nected. The pair of combatants occurs in the following combinations: 1. With other groups of fighters, sometimes obviously merely a pleasing frieze of variations on a theme of good omen.1 2. A group showing the sun-god in battle is accompanied by other groups of fighting gods, not characterized as sun-gods.2 3. In two instances the group appears with the goddess of fertility (our Plates 11, g and iv, e)\ if in these instances we have to suppose a connexion between the battle-scenes and the main theme of the cylinder it could only be that the fighters were liberating the brother and paramour of the goddess who is kept a prisoner in the mountain. But the Epic of Creation which names Kingu belongs to an entirely different body of beliefs, and though in the New Year Festival the cycle of the victorious sun-god and that of the liberated fertility-god are combined, it seems to me to be begging the question if we use the name Kingu, who belongs to the first cycle, to denote a van- quished foe on early seals unless he is definitely subdued by a god with rays. Now there is one group of scenes in which the weapon of the victorious god is not the mace but the fire-brand. In the finest of these (Plate iv, dy left-hand group) the victor is not qualified as a sun-god, but in all other in- stances he has rays at his shoulders (group VIII).3 The little figure behind the mountain is somewhat cramped on this seal, but is clearly shown in another instance4 to be blowing upon the flames which destroy the victim. Here one is obviously reminded of the comment on the New Year Festival contained in the tablet K. 3476, 1.8: 'The fire which blazes before Belit; the sheep which is put upon the oven, which the flame destroys; that is Kingu as he is burned by fire.'5 Unfortunately the burning of Kingu is not mentioned in the Epic of Crea- tion where, on the contrary, 'the arteries of his blood were severed', a scene most graphically shown on a number of Sargonid seals (Plate in, ?, left- hand group). Here the victim's head is pulled up by the beard so as to bare his throat for the victor's dagger. Summing up, we can say that the incon- sistencies and variation of mythological traits which we observe in the texts of the first millennium appear to be exactly the same on the cylinder seals of 1 e.g. Bibl. Nat. 65, 66; Louvre A. 127, 128, 129, 130; S. 471. 2 e.g. De Clercq 181, 181 bis; Philadelphia 150. 3 We therefore interpret his weapon as a fire- brand rather than as lightning, though it is of the same shape as the lightning held by the storm-god on 'Hittite' monuments of Senjirli and elsewhere. 4 De Clercq 176. 5 Zimmern, Zum.

FRANKFORT the Sargonid age, and that in a number of cases the vanquished god is most probably Kingu. The mountain has its place in almost all the scenes where the victim is burned, but its role is difficult to appraise. It would be a fitting stage for the sun-god's victory when he rises upon the eastern mountains; on the other hand it appears on a seal in Berlin behind the god of fertility,1 and we possess in Plate iv, e a graphic rendering of the watch kept by the Great Mother at the grave of her son and lover whose head, hands, and feet are shown as projecting from a mountain, upon which she sits. And it is in precisely the same role that the mountain appears in the New Year Festival where Zimmern calls it 'the "World-mountain" in which is the land of the dead, the Underworld'.2 A more poetical rendering of the sojourn of the goddess at Tammuz's mountain-grave is shown in Plates iv, / and v, 0, where the mountain is merely drawn in outline in order to show clearly what happens inside it. There we see, in Plate iv,/, the goddess in a most unusual attitude while the reviving god emerges from the ground.3 In another commentary on the New Year Festival (Vat. 9555, 1. 16) we read (after Langdon): 'The goddess who tarries with him has descended (to seek) for his welfare', but in a note he justifies his translation of katnasu by'to tarry' since normally it means 'to kneel', which is exactly what the goddess in Plate iv,/is doing.4 The smaller cylinder (Plate v, a) explains the meaning of the god who, both in that scene and in Plate iv, / pulls up the plants with which the mountain is covered; for he is marked there as a sun-god, and the well-known lament that life and fertility come to a standstill on earth while Tammuz is in his grave and the goddess has gone to seek him is here expressed by showing the scorching summer sun of Mesopotamia in the act of destroying the plants. In our texts the resurrection of Tammuz is rather a revival than a libera- tion, though we have seen, in discussing the Hydra, that this view need not be presumed to have predominated equally in the Early Dynastic period in which battles of the gods are not unknown. And similarly the comment on part of the New Year Festival ends with the liberation of Marduk at the hands of other gods : 'They bored holes in the door and there they waged battle.' In the actual liberation Nabu (Marduk's son) and a goddess play a prominent part. And again there are Sargonid seals on which this scene is evidently 1 Weber 440. 2 Zimmern, Zum Bab. Neujahrsfest, il. 3. 3 The god does not emerge from the mountain- side as is often supposed and as our photograph might suggest. The separation between god and mountain is clear in such figures as Prinz, Altor. Symbolik, pi. ??, 12, or Sch?fer-Andrae, loe. cit., 452. The erroneous connexion of the emerging god with the outline for the mountain is no doubt largely responsible for the interpretation of the tree-clad mountain as a bent tree. Opitz (A.f.O. vin. 329 ff.) sees in our Plate iv, c an illustration of the new episode of the Gilgamesh legend which Mr. Gadd discovered among the texts found at Ur, but a com- parison of the translation (R.A., xxx. 127-43) with the seal shows that the seal and the text have very little in common even if one interprets as a tree what we believe to be a mountain covered with vegetation. 4 Langdon, Epic of Creation, p. 36, 1. 16; p. 37, n. 5.</page><page sequence="27">PLATE IV (a) M.J., 1929, 76 (c) De Clercq, 143 (d) Louvre, A. 142 (e) Louvre, A. 131 (/) Louvre, T. 100</page><page sequence="28">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 25 shown (Plate v, b-d). It is characteristic that the seal-cutter is at pains to show that the goddess is not a mere spectator but helps to bring about the victory; in Plate v, b she holds the enemy's hair, in Plate v, c his foot. The actual killing of the enemy is performed by a god armed with a bow in Plate v, by and while the victor in Plate v, c is unarmed, he is there assisted by an animal, the lion-headed eagle. Thus we may assert that the god who in Sargonid times took the part later played by Nabu was Ningirsu or Ninurta ; and he is indeed clearly marked as such in Plate v, d, where the result of his victory, the emergence of the captive 'Marduk' from the 'mountain', is shown. The figure on the left is not only accompanied by Ninurta's lion, but carries the bow of the victor in Plate v, ?, and if we compare him with the left-hand figure of Plate in, a we recognize not only the bow but also the lion's skin, of which the tail is shown hanging down and which marks this god as the victor of Labbu. It is also significant that in some texts Nabu, who liberates Marduk, is given the title Ab-u, 'Lord of Vegetation', which originally pertained to Ninurta the conqueror of Labbu and Zu.1 Moreover, there is a late text published by Ebeling:2 'The king ... is Ninurta, who has avenged his father. ... He comes forth from the mountain.' The family relation of the gods involved we shall leave for the moment ; it is a fruitful means of effecting a hierarchy which theologians might require for political or other reasons. The king and Ninurta appear here, in any case, in the role played by Nabu in Babylon when Marduk is brought from the Mountain, and thus there is again agreement between the late texts and the Sargonid seals. This agreement exists also as regards the main personage in the drama. While Marduk is the son of Ea, the purely Semitic sun-god Shamash is called a son of Sin, and the sun-gods with Sumerian antecedents such as Nergal and Ninurta are children of Enlil. But in our Plate iv, a and c we find a group in which a sun-god comes to worship Ea. The personality of the latter cannot be doubted ; here is the clearest possible rendering of the description in the Epic of Creation of how Ea caused his secret chamber to be founded in the apsu, the chapel of Plate iv, a and b round which the 'waters of the deep' are shown to flow is surely Ea's abode.3 If the waters are absent in Plate iv, c the stream of water flowing from the side of the god is a sure sign of his identity and that the kiskanu tree is pictured behind him is more than likely. It is this last seal which establishes with least ambiguity the knowledge in Sargonid times of a sun-god who stood in the same relation to Ea as Marduk ; but Plate iv, a expresses that same idea more elaborately, the sun-god doing homage to Ea while he climbs the 'mountain of the east' upon which we see the gate so well known from other seals ; or possibly, the design is intended to render a ziggurat with a temple on top.4 In any case we can now understand the other 1 Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, 8, note. 2 Ebeling, Tod und Leben, 36, 1. 20. 3 See also Speleers, No. 590. 4 The last view is held by Mrs. E. Douglas van Buren, The Flowing Vase, 37 ; she sees in this structure the sanctuary built for Marduk by the</page><page sequence="29">26 H. FRANKFORT group of Plate iv, a. In the foreground we see a small god with a lion ; this figure we have recognized above as Ninurta, the precursor of Marduk's son, Nabu, who liberates his father. Behind Ninurta the sun-god himself is shown rising from between two wing-like objects, grasping his saw. The vagueness of the object from which he emerges is easily explained for it renders chaos itself, Tiamat. There are several texts which prove this. In a hymn of Marduk he is called : '.. . the lord who dwells at the Akitu Festival in the midst o/Tiamat'.1 We know that after killing Tiamat : The lord rested beholding the cadaver, As he divided the monster, devising cunning things, He split her into two parts, like an oyster.2 and that this division could be pictorially expressed by the Ancients by means of wings, as is done in our Plate iv, a, follows from another text : 'The pigeon which is thrown is Tiamat. It is thrown and cut into two halves'.3 If Tiamat is the enemy whom the victorious sun-god slays with his own hand, we still have to identify the antagonist of Ninurta on the seals where the liberation of an imprisoned sun-god is shown. He is nowhere provided with any distinctive signs. But in the texts there are several suggestions of animosity between Marduk and Enmesharra, one of which seems to imply that Enmesharra was vanquished by Ninurta on behalf of Marduk.4 The role of warder of a dead or wounded god certainly befits the Babylonian Pluto, and the battle-scenes on seals discussed above may (except in cases where the victim is attacked by firebrands or is subdued by the sun-god in person) as well represent struggles with Enmesharra as with Kingu. This applies especially to such scenes as are shown in Plates n, g&gt; and iv, ey where a relation with the pre-Sargonid god of fertility is indicated if we are in these cases allowed to attach value to the combination of scenes on one cylinder. Our uncertainty was shared, it seems, by a number of ancient theologians, for we see that they evolved many cross-connexions and identifications for the trio Enmesharra, Kingu, and Tammuz.5 An alternative interpretation of the enemy on the mountain would be Zu, who would then be rendered in this scene, as in our Plate in, cy in human shape. We shall have to return to this possibility presently. grateful gods after his victory over Tiamat. If Mrs. van Buren sees Marduk in the sun-gods on such cylinders as Bibl. Nat. 73 or B.M. 120,540 (her Figs. 7 and 8) we can only follow her with reserve. Since the occurrence of Marduk in Sargonid times remained to be proved, the objection could be made that the sun-gods on the seals just quoted might well be other deities. On the other hand, the indubitable evidence from the seals in our Plate iv, a and c adds probability to her view, and so would her conten- tion that on Bibl. Nat. 73 and B.M. 120,540 Ea is 'an interested onlooker', if only we were sure that there was always a connexion between the various scenes on one cylinder. Since Mrs. van Buren's exhaustive work and the present article often cover the same ground with results which sometimes agree and sometimes diverge, it is well to state here that the book appeared while the present writer was still in the field, only becoming available to him in August 1933? by which time this article was already written. 1 Ebeling, Tod und Leben, 25, Rs. 1. 4. 2 Langdon, Epic of Creation, iv. 135-7. 3 Ebeling, Tod und Leben, 36, 1. 19. 4 Ebeling, loe. cit., 33; Zimmern, Zum.

If Plate v, b and c are incon- clusive, Plate v, d leaves no doubt, since the identical goddess, with plants rising from her shoulders and the same bunch of dates in her hand, is found as a goddess of vegetation on the fragment of Entemena's inscribed steatite vase in Berlin (Plate V, A). The same combination of sun-gods and fertility- gods appears in Plate iv,/where we see, on the right, an offering made to a divinity clearly marked as sun-god by the disk in front of him. Yet if the appearance of that figure together with the mountain-scene has any meaning at all, it can only show an adoration of the god after he has been liberated from his grave where the goddess visited him. The god in the mountain would then render a sun-god. The puzzling combination of characteristics which Marduk exhibits at the New Year Festival is found here again on early seals. We must now study the remainder of the subject of Plate v, d. On the left we have identified the god (Ninurta) and the goddess who together effected the liberation of the sun-god emerging from the mountain in the midst of the scene. On the right we see a water-god, followed by a god with two faces ; the water-god holds an eagle. This group of water-god, bifrons and captive, is very common, but appears generally in another form (group XIII, Plate v, e).1 We see the enthroned water-god before whom a bound bird-man is brought apparently for judgement, for his hands are usually tied. This scene has often been identified with the capture of the storm-bird Zu who stole the 'Tablets of Destiny'. Above (p. 15) we have explained a scene, in which an eagle was killed, as the execution of Zu, and it therefore remains to be proved that bird and bird-man are identical in meaning. Now we know already that a certain variation in the rendering of gods pre- vails especially in the case of those who may be symbolized by animals. Thus Ningizzida appears as a human-headed serpent (Plates 1, c and 11, a) or in human shape (Fig. 2) or as a human being with snakes projecting from his body (Fig. 3). Similarly Zu seems, in the rendering represented by our Plate in, d (group IV) to be pictured as a bird, but in Plate ni, casa man accompanied by a bird and as a bird-man in the large group XIII of which Plate v, e gives a specimen. The biid-man, as an ideogram of the anthropo- morphic god with his distinctive animal, stands absolutely on a par with the snake-man of group I (Plate 11, a) rendering Ningizzida. The foregoing argument, however, does not show more than that the bird and the bird-man may refer to an identical personage. More conclusive proof regarding his character is supplied by the figure of Ea, which accompanies bird and bird-man in certain seals. In Plate v, d, /, and g the water-god stands in an attitude not otherwise assumed by him at all. He places one foot on a mountain. However excep- tional this attitude may be in the case of Ea, there can be no question of error or confusion since we possess three instances in which it is adopted. In fact This group has been studied by Mrs. van Buren, The Flowing Vase, 41-50, in detail.</page><page sequence="31">28 H. FRANKFORT it is highly significant ; for Plate v, d shows that the mountain upon which Ea places his foot is that which contains the god who is to be liberated. If the water-god assumes the same attitude on the other three seals1 where the capture of the bird is the main subject, and where, in the standard version, Ea is always shown enthroned as judge, the meaning is clear. The seal-cutter wished to suggest that the capture of the wicked Zu was but the prelude to a yet more momentous event, the epiphany of the liberated god. Again, Ea is made to hold the bird in Plate v, d in order to show that its capture preceded the god's liberation. Similarly, Pallis places Ninurta's victory over Zu at the New Year Festival before Marduk's egress from the mountain.2 And if we may interpret the combination of scenes in Plate m, c at all, it would seem to mean that the sun-god is adored there after Zu has been executed. On a seal from Tell Asmar we see the execution of the bird and next to it, as in Plate in, Cy the sun rising. And in an obscure text, published by Ebeling, Ninurta's victory over Enmesharra (Marduk's warder) is again closely associated with the defeat of Zu.3 All this evidence makes it quite feasible to see in the enemy of Plate V, b and c also Zu in human shape. Corroborative evidence for our interpretation is finally supplied by a somewhat crude Sargonid seal from Kish4 which shows amongst a group of other deities the god with the bow of our Plate V, d in the very act of shooting an arrow at the bird which in Plate v, d is held by Ea. And Ninurta's victory here takes place upon the mountain in which the god is confined. 1 Through the courtesy of Mr. J. M. Upton, Acting Curator of the Department of Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, I obtained photographs of the seals figured by Ward as Figs. 291 and 454 c. The seals are now in the Morgan Library. The first shows the bird-man brought to judgement before Ea, who rises from the waters of the apsu which surround him in a triple stream. Ea places his foot on land or a mountain represented by three dots. The other photograph (our Plate v,g) shows that Ward omitted in his Fig. 454 c the mountain upon which Ea places his foot and which is clearly discernible in the photo- graph. In the right-hand group one sees an anthropo- morphic god, presumably Zu in human shape as in our Plate in, c, attacked by a god and a lion-headed eagle, while a smaller lion-headed eagle is shown in the field below. The attacking god is identified by the larger Imgi and is, of course, Ninurta or Nin- girsu. The smaller Imgi may well be a mistaken drawing for an ordinary eagle which would have characterized the victim as it does in our Plate in, c. There is a seal impression in Philadelphia (No. 177) which is almost identical but which is too fragmen- tary to show much. The larger Imgi is there, but the smaller one is not, and of Ea we see, if anything at all, only one of the fishes which accompany him. 2 The Babylonian Akitu Festival, p. 156; Zim- mern, Zum. Bab. Neujahrsfest, 118. 3 Ebeling, Tod und Leben, 33, 11. 24-39. It is interesting to remember that the mountains where the sun set and rose were considered to be the entrance and exit of the nether world and therefore of the country of the dead (see W. B. Kristensen, in Verhandelingen Kon. Akademie v. Wetenschappen, Amsterdam, 1916, 54 fr.); on the whole, the seal- cutters do not exploit this double aspect of the moun- tains, and show them either as the scene of the sun- god's rising (in a large number of seals not discussed here) or as the nether world in which a god is held captive. But in one seal in the Louvre (A. 144) the sun-god is seen rising from the mountain in a man- ner which contrasts with the activity with which he generally steps upon it; he emerges with drooping arms from the nether world, and on this seal we see at the side the bird-man being led away as a captive. 4 Mrs. van Buren, The Flowing Vase, pi. 11, 5 (plate ix, a in this journal). On this seal the figures are not all part of one scene as in our Plate v, d, but besides the contest of .Ninurta and Zu there is a row of stiffly placed gods, which seems to contain the most important figures of the pantheon, without our being able to say whether they are meant to appear in the role of spectators. We may at the same time protest here against the attempt to introduce the Offord cylinder once more into scientific litera- ture! (Flowing Vase, 30). No genuine cylinder on which such an ambitious scheme of composition was attempted was ever executed in such an uncer- tain manner. The various points in which the forger misunderstood the draperies of B.M. 89, 115 which was his prototype, happen to suggest to Mrs. van Buren a Syro-Hittite type of dress. But could they be bungled in any other way? No Syro-Hittite cylinder, to my knowledge, shows either this style of cutting or this scheme of spacing the decoration.</page><page sequence="32">PLATE V (g) Ward, 454 c (h) Vase fragment in Berlin (i) Morgan, 137</page><page sequence="33">GODS AND MYTHS ON SARGONID SEALS 29 There is one figure in the cylinder of Plate v, d which has not yet been interpreted. It is the small bull lying beside the mountain. It could, as far as the composition is concerned, be combined with the water-god but would not then give any meaning as far as I can see. The only alternative seems to be to refer it to the sun-god who emerges from the mountain ; and then one is tempted frankly to name this god Marduk since the ideograms of his name can be interpreted 'young bull of the sun'.1 I do not see any objection to this identification except that it runs counter to the accepted view that Marduk was a god of purely local significance up to the rise of Babylon under the Hammurabi Dynasty.2 But we have found on Sargonid seals a sun-god dependent on Ea, whom it would be very difficult to name unless it be Marduk. Marduk's role in the Epic of Creation cannot, furthermore, be explained as being originally assigned to another god.3 Ninurta appears on our seals as a slayer of monsters or gods, it is true, yet his action does not constitute a final victory like Marduk's in the Epic of Creation, but only a means of liberating the god in the mountain. We have also seen that the beliefs of the period of Akkad contain exactly the same mixture of features from sun-cult and fertility-cult which we know to be characteristic of Marduk in later times. We have in the third section of this paper tried to explain how this mixture could be a consequence of the Semitic inter- pretation of Sumerian beliefs. The rendering of the ideograms of Marduk's name suggests that he was originally perhaps more closely connected with the sun than most Sumerian deities. If that were so it would be conceivable that he was particularly popular with the Semites of the dynasty of Akkad, and that therefore the syncretistic theology which was the outcome of their increasing influence in Mesopotamia centred round Marduk. 1 Ebeling in Pauly-Wissowa, 14, p, 1669. 2 See above, p. 6. King, Chronicles of Early Babylonian Kings, 8, 11, cannot be adduced as proof that Marduk was worshipped in the time of Sargon of Akkad. 3 As Langdon does, Epic of Creation, 18 f. ; Sem. Myth., 115.</page></plain_text>
