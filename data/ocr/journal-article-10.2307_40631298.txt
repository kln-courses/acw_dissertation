<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW An Aesthetic of Pain Alicia Ostriker, Woman Under the Surface: Poems and Prose Poems, Princeton University Press. Like Orpheus, Alicia Ostriker makes "that journey / Down from song, down to the impulse of singing" in her fifth volume of poems, A Woman Under the Surface. But unlike Orpheus, who "could not carry, haul, rob / His bride back," Ostriker makes us feel the unsentimental solid-iron aesthetic of pain, fear, and bitter beauty that undercuts her singing. In 'Tor the Daughters" she announces: Song, as you gather it, is not desire, Not some requirement you may finally fill. Song is being. For the god, trivial. But when are we? And when does he deliver To our existence here the earth and stars? Within the four sections, Ostriker reinvents the Eros / Psyche myth (wom- en's curiosities are no longer punished), a host of family spirits and struggles, the political understatement of news events from National Public Radio. In deadpan narration, she exposes the gap between the bland public voice of a consumer society that tames violence and the real horror of death, maiming, and daily terror ("The Demonstration," 'This Dreamer Cometh," and 'Ter- rorist Trial and the Games"). In rewriting the "History of America," she deftly sets "a prior circle: a mouth" against "a linear projection: a route." Most successful, perhaps, is her homage to various artists - Dante, Ma- tisse, Van Gogh, Renoir, Rilke. Probing the relation of art to life, she finds that the source of creative power is often the source of one's crippling or destruction. We see Renoir "at the end painting with brushes strapped to his hand / Arthritic, crippled - his palette aroused 'to crepuscular / Pinks, oranges, reds, his nudes ever more voluptuous/ " All the while, the "plump, middle-class Parisiennes" continue their languid, post-war indulgences. In "A Minor Van Gogh," "the strokes are pulses," an ironic counterpoint to the artisfs end: . . . The strokes Rush forward, waving their hats, identical, All elements alike, all particles Of Christ's material dancing, even The shadowed furrow saying / exist, I live!</page><page sequence="2">Review 83 It is Claude Monef s life that raises the central question. At nrst a bourgeois "glutton of light/7 Monet lost his eyesight around 1922 and began to paint "red / Mud and whiplashes . . . the waterlilies bursting like painless bombs/7 And the poet asks, 'Is it from him? or around him? His old man's forehead / Garlanded." Open to the "virtue of the pure unknown," Ostriker never bends her knee to clich√©, never makes ideological genuflections before the sentimental or the unrevised. Her verse gleams with the quicksilver of a blackbelf s revenge: a verse with registered iambs and feet, yet lulled by the rule of the contemplative like a mandolin concerto. She prefers the pure elevation of September ("definite as wood") to the celebrated lushness of April: . . . being keen To race through walls, to experience all Conceivable human passion, To be broken man, while still a girl? Ostriker's imagination breaks forth like the rough hind leg of the centaur at the very moment when neat closure or appeal to the ordinary might slow the verse. In "Anxiety About Dying," the poet waves goodbye to her teeth: "It seems they are leaving by train for a vacation / I'll meet them in the country when I can." She glories in contradictions, verifying Whitman's claim that "I am large, I contain multitudes." In the midst of lovemaking, a black- bird's serrated wing passes soundlessly between lovers, then lifts to a black dot in the sky. Ironic anthropomorphism surrounds the "geriatric" San Juan waterfront, a "relation between building / And vegetation, which the big hotels, lifting their knees, trample." In the words of pseudo-science she narrates a husband's betrayal: "When she returned home, conditions / Were such that she believed a betrayal of synchronicity / And a lapse of energy and love had occurred." A young girl kicks her father in the stomach for faking a heart attack, but the price of her new serenity ("light as a fleet of balloons") is imposed silence. A runner sees the "bright bone under brown landscape" and Begins to feel how fire invades a body From within, first the splinters And crumpled paper, then the middle wood And the great damp logs splendidly catching. Evident in her dear ironies and luminous imagery is pure motion: the diver's body "saying a kind of prayer," words and language useless. "Goddesses, mortal women, pigs and homecoming" - these are the in- gredients of Ostriker's redefined mythmaking, the simple story that underlies everything. In the opening poem, women gathered in a beige, soundproofed waiting room fear betrayal of their bodies. They are divided from this aware- ness, however - as they are from each other - by rings, tweeds, social struc- tures. Only a woman's piercing scream unites them in silent knowledge of the body's truth. In this post-Rich world, the shipwrecked self has learned not only what tools one can do without, learned the medium where women can escape, but also how to define "the living mind you fail to describe / In your dead language." Ostriker casts aside Adrienne Rich's androg-</page><page sequence="3">84 Prairie Schooner yne and the wreck of historical consciousness for a new, Utopian revenge. In //rThe Exchange/7 a powerful new myth figure swimming below a nuclear family climbs into the boat, changes places with the speaker, and even strangles her children: Skin dripping, she will take my car, drive home. When my husband answers the doorbell and sees This magnificent naked woman, bits of sunlight Glittering on her pubic fur, her muscular Arm will surround his neck, once for each insult Endured. He will see the blackbird in her eye, Her dying mouth incapable of speech, And I, having exchanged with her, will swim Away, in the cool water, out of reach. And in the final poems, tutored by such mistresses, woman yields to a new imperative: "Now you know how to sing / Now you have to make / Your own story/' Practicing the very best principle of revisionism in her poetry, Ostriker can say with confidence of her own work: When she sings, when she dances, it is asking How to capture, how to keep, how to give back, unmasking Beauty, the seed to the sower, the gift to the giver - Go, book, and say this time she conquers.
