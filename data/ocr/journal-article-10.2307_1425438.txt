<plain_text><page sequence="1">Culture, Merchandise, or Just Light Entertainment? New Architecture at the Millennium BRUCE THOMAS, Lehigh University Much of the recent discussion about architectural theory concerns the so- called New Spirit in design, an approach that urges a redefinition of archi- tecture in ways "more appropriate" to our media-driven, commercially dominated millennial culture. Many of these ideas are wrapped around their own newness. Yet if examined closely, the newest new is not without prece- dent. More troubling is the contention that the quality of empathy in archi- tecture must be redefined. Empathy has been essential to the shaping of the built environment, a characteristic that most literally renders architecture a humanist endeavor. Yet now we are being told that an appropriate empathy for our time does not celebrate our place in the universe; rather, the human condition is one of violation and abuse. This essay questions the New Spirit's claim of newness and its interpre- tation of empathy. The appropriation of unprecedented newness is contra- dicted by even the most superficial examination of various avant-garde movements that have paraded through the twentieth century. The essay fur- ther argues that a theory that finds the Enlightenment definition of empathy to be a mask for human abuse and degradation is no more than "tabloid hu- manism," perhaps appropriate to our age, but nonetheless a perversion when applied to the discipline of architecture. The author Marge Piercy explains that she writes reviews when she believes that "something being admired is less than admirable; perhaps meretricious, perhaps dangerous. " This essay is written for the same reason. COMPOSITIONAL SKILL AND FACILITY WITH VISUAL AESTHETICS MAKE architecture a fine art. An understanding of materials and technol- ogy makes architecture a complex science. Good intentions and be- nevolent principles make building a responsible and ennobling endeavor. Encompassing all of these skills and ideals, architecture, as Ralph Erskine has defined it, is "that rich and all-embracing weave of practical and spiritual satisfactions . . . this exceptional art which both protects our bodies and expresses our dreams."'As such, architecture is more than gallery art, no matter how stimulating and captivating the aesthetic, and architectural theory is more than an intellectual parlor game, no matter how clever and provocative the premise. The essential nature and social responsibilities of an en- deavor that has so proudly claimed the mantles of both art and sci- ence should not be cast aside in a cavalier manner-even if the newest visual aesthetic is exciting, even if the latest intellectual pose is appealing. The most compelling evidence of the scope of architecture is contained in the built work. However, the key to understanding that work is also to be found in the intentions of the architect, what is often categorized as "theory." The struggle to understand theory's relationship to the creative process and to the built product lies in the complexity of architecture itself: Theory is often appropriated to bridge the sometimes conflicting requirements of art and science. The increasing distance between art and science, which dates from at least the fourteenth century, is responsible for misunderstanding and misinterpretation within the discipline of architecture. Vincent Scully contends that an indulgence in intellectual gymnastics is partly responsible for that distancing, characterizing a certain con- fusion of art and science in architectural theory over the centuries as "one of the silliest and most persistent beliefs of French criticism, which was to pop up in various guises throughout history, culmi- nating, if that is the word, in the peculiar twist of Deconstructivism itself, wherein 'art' is in fact made by the critic, by 'science.'3"2 That confusion is symptomatic of critics' and theorists' tendency to cre- ate a disjunction between design theory and what is actually built. This separation is a fortuitous one for today's media-driven culture, for it allows a choice to be made between architecture and merely thinking about architecture. As is apparently being demonstrated by the New Spirit, thinking is preferable because it can be produced and consumed far quicker and easier than building itself. Provoca- tive theory stretches the limits of a discipline-a healthy and nec- essary exercise-but with the power of today's media, with its insatiable appetite for the next new thing, we should be wary of sur- rendering too easily the tangible nature of architecture. Now, as the New Spirit begins to be built, we should ask whether it is a worthy successor to previous theories of the New. When Peter Eisenman boasts that he is able to make the av- erage person physically ill through his new manipulation of space and Lebbeus Woods hypothesizes an urban landscape in which people are compelled to inhabit the bombed ruins of war-torn cit- ies, the New Spirit in design should be questioned as to its inten- tions.3 What kind of built environment will be produced as the New Spirit theory is misunderstood and misapplied by lesser tal- ents, as has been the case with every other fashion in architecture? As we approach the millennium, some of the discipline's most persuasive figures seem to be asking us to reconsider architecture as we have known it, and to prepare for revisions on an apocalyptic scale. Eisenman explains that humanism, the centerpiece of western culture since the Renaissance, is already dead and buried.4 Having wearied of the postmodern trivialities he so happily helped peddle, Charles Jencks has apparently left this mortal coil and taken archi- tecture with him into the "Jumping Universe."' Woods urges us to consider the attractions of an Orwellian world-we've been there for Journal ofArchitectural Education, pp. 254-264 ? 1997 ACSA, Inc. May 1997 JAE 50/4 254</page><page sequence="2">some time anyway, he explains-in which war is peace, destruction is creation, and we will live in bombed-out Bosnian ruins.' This is a scary prospect. To the fainthearted, architectural schemes (and cultural ideals) posited by Eisenman, Woods, Daniel Libeskind, and any number of those engaged in the so-called New Spirit or New Freedom in design may suggest the words of Friedrich Nietzsche's madman: "Whither are we moving? ... Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing?"7 Some skeptics of the New Spirit con- tend that recent architecture and theory reveal nothing so much as narcissism and self-indulgence substituted for the superior ideals and aspirations prevalent earlier in the century.8 This may be too harsh. Jencks, of all people, warns of "the harnessing of instrumen- tal reason not to the project of the Enlightenment but to the forces of darkness."' This is almost certainly overly alarmist, not to men- tion melodramatic, yet the manner in which the New Spirit repo- sitions design and theory for a new millennium begs the question of whether some of the qualities that have for centuries given build- ing "the bite and sweet gravity of things real and beautiful" are be- ing overlooked or even willfully distorted.'o If this is so, it must also be asked: To what ends? An Avant-garde for the Media Age Art, the expression ofsociety, manifests, in its highest soaring, the most advanced social tendencies: it is the forerunner and the revealer. Therefore, to know whether art worthily fulfills its proper mission as initiator, whether the artist is truly ofthe avant-garde, one must know where Humanity is going, know what the destiny of the human race is. -Gabriel-Desire Laverdant, De la mission de l'art et du role des artistes (1845) Despite the radical nature of what they espouse, Eisenman, Jencks, Woods, and others place themselves in a secure position. The inter- section of an artistic avant-garde and a rarefied intellectualization of the rational discipline of architecture is for some a comfortable perch. In this regard, it is tempting to recall a pointed remark penned by Somerset Maugham in 1919: "It is not difficult to be unconventional in the eyes of the world when your unconvention- ality is but the convention of your set. It affords you then an inor- dinate amount of self-esteem. You have the self-satisfaction of courage without the inconvenience of danger."''" An avant-garde that adheres to the convention of its set is hardly an unusual phenomenon-one needs to look no further than the twentieth-century art industry for multiple examples. However, as is the case with so many aspects of our turn-of-the-millennium world, it is worth considering the relationship between the most recent avant-garde and today's hypermedia culture and asking to what degree and to what ends this affinity shapes architecture. Ever since the moment at the beginning of this century-or maybe it was in the previous century, or the one before that-when the avant-garde appropriated key aspects of the intellectual basis of architecture, theorists have found it helpful to sell certain adopted principles as gospel truth. Like a silver-tongued snake oil salesman, the avant-garde seduces with a carefully crafted concoction of intel- lect, personality, and, although the open use of the term is avoided, style. The object is to bottle culture itself and to label it theory. Whether this alchemy represents an appropriately complex and inclusive understanding of architecture-and culture-or whether it is primarily the result of external and transitory influences, such as intellectual fads and aesthetic fashions, should be a subject of debate. Over the past few decades, architectural production has become ever more engulfed in a media-driven and marketing-oriented world. This should come as no surprise, for architecture has never been removed from its contemporary culture. Despite numerous facile characteriza- tions that paint architecture as a mirror that passively reflects certain aspects of society, it has never been merely a reflective medium. Rather, architecture is an active principal component in the making of culture-and a very tangible and expensive one at that.12 Today's media culture depends on the availability of an inex- haustible supply of new images. Increasingly, evidence suggests that the image is independent from, and more important than, the reality it supposedly represents. For the architectural avant-garde, the be- trothed weary from a century-long engagement with the architectural object, it is a divorce made in heaven. For those who prefer to believe that architecture is more real than that, for those who agree with Michael Benedikt that "in our media-saturated times it falls to archi- tecture to have the direct esthetic experience of the real at the center of its concerns," it is confounding to realize that the discipline itself aids and abets its own submersion in this brave new world.13 In a shrewd examination of the effect of these forces on architecture, writ- ten almost a decade ago, Stephen Kieran recounts the coercive nature of marketing that turns architecture into a consumer product and makes practice primarily the creation of designer labels. Yet, he con- cludes, "These quandaries notwithstanding, acceptance [of market- ing- and media-driven architecture] is the only potentially constructive response."'" But with what results? 255 Thomas</page><page sequence="3">The acceptance postulated by Kieran has taken a number of forms. The stage-set building and fashion-of-the-week costumes of postmodernism were perhaps the most overt examples, but in a num- ber of more significant ways, in reaction to the often misguided and arrogant heroism of the Modern movement, discussions of architec- ture have forsaken its raison d'tre, the building, the architectural ob- ject. Instead, criticism is often prized above building itself. In critical discourse, a distancing from real building is now often the norm; as John Whiteman comments, "The two, [critical] meaning and mate- riality, are never to be conjoined."" Sad to say, the same is true of any smart marketing strategy for an inferior product. The reality of build- ing is simply not exciting enough; it cannot live up to the hype of much recent theory. Writing of Zaha Hadid's first executed project, the Vitra fire station of 1993, Thomas Fisher observed that when her paintings and drawings for the "Peak" competition in Hong Kong appeared in 1984, they seemed on the cutting edge of design. Yet, later, with the realization of an actual building, Hadid's work "seems somehow old-fashioned. Bold iconoclastic form-making, in and of itself, no longer seems very daring."16 In the architectural process, synthesis sometimes compares poorly to imaginative hypothesis. Often, the representation of architecture has ascended to the position of having intrinsic value unrelated to any actual built prod- uct. This is not without precedent. Marketing forces have always driven architecture, being part of the fundamental client-architect equation. Moreover, two centuries ago, French visionary architec- ture raised the issue of the relationship between drawing and build- ing: Etienne-Louis Boullee's most significant work was on paper only; some of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's most provocative forms, the plan of the Oikema, for example-were available only to those few able to possess an expensive folio. Beginning in the late seventies, architects like Michael Graves and Stanley Tigerman and outlets like the Max Protech Gallery in New York City reestablished a sepa- rate market for architectural drawings. Significantly, drawing was viewed not as a means of producing architecture, but rather as a medium for opposing the limitations inherent in the making of buildings. Tigerman explained that such drawings demonstrated how "the very tradition of synthesis is gradually eroded, suggesting the greater power of the juxtaposition of thesis and antithesis.""17 Reality is a relative term. Now, as the "simulacrum" continues to gain currency in architectural theory and as the map of culture is being recharted in cyberspace, tinkering with the architectural design process is more than merely a matter of exchanging juxtaposition for synthesis. Humanism may, as Eisenman and others so glibly con- tend, already be gone, but its replacement is at best a highly specula- tive alternative. As the raw power of media plays an ever larger role in shaping the intellectual basis for much of the emerging millennium's culture, we run the risk of building a new architecture not on substantial foundations, but according to a debasement of humanist ideals, what might be described as "tabloid humanism."" Since architecture is the most public of arts, the effect of media-shaped theory on the production of a shared built environ- ment should be a paramount consideration. Why, for example, does so much of recent theory seem to be the product of an in-house Academy Editions think tank? Should antitrust laws be applied to intellectual discourse? Alas, to examine this relationship is presump- tuous, at the very least intellectual bad manners, some true believ- ers scold. For example, Rosalind Krauss condemns criticism of Eisenman as "philistine silliness," arguing that it should be regarded as "some kind of annoying fly that has landed on one's shoulder."'' To those who would prefer not to be bothered by critical analysis founded in less rarefied definitions of architecture and culture, skeptical consideration of the New Spirit in design is not much fun and drags the discourse into openly addressing architecture as a commodity (something best kept in the closet) with all the associ- ated notions of fashion, micro- and macroeconomics, cultural he- gemony, political duplicity, and other messy things. Better, accolytes of the New Spirit would paradoxically counsel, just to stick to simple, axiomatic truths: "Architecture is Art" or "Architec- ture is the spirit of the age made manifest" (and to the age its art, and to art its freedom). Unfortunately, dependence on simple axi- oms may obscure more subtle, but perhaps more real, truths. Of these "truths," or fundamental principles that have long been held as central to architectural production and discourse, two stand out for particular and critical examination-of themselves and of recent reinterpretations. One issue is more significant to media's relation to architecture and most certainly to the neo-avant-garde's production of contemporary theory: that is, the issue of newness. The other speaks more directly of one of the characteristics that has for centuries shaped architecture, namely, the quality ofempathy in building. The first is be- ing seriously misconstrued. The second is being perverted. New Again The millennium, coming so soon, so hard upon, is bad tim- ing. In the year 999, in the year 1499, in the year 1899 (and in all the years between: the millennium is a permanent mil- lennium)-it didn't really matter what people felt or what theyfelt like saying. The end of the worldjust wasn't coming. Nobody had the hardware. -Martin Amis, London Fields (1990) May 1997 JAE 50/4 256</page><page sequence="4">In magazines, in galleries, and now on the street, high-style archi- tecture is awash with dazzling models, drawings, and computer-gen- erated images, some of which seem intentionally designed to defy comprehension and so plead to be recognized as New. Each new thing is accompanied by legions of acolytes who prefer not to be troubled by the skeptic. Most of the authors of the New claim that the conditions of our age, and consequently the very nature of today's design theory, are unprecedented-that the New Spirit or New Freedom is quintessentially New. It is important to establish the validity of such a claim because much recent theory is wrapped around the singular truth of its own newness. If the core premise is shaky, the possibility exists that the latest theory is mere fashion-- seductive, entertaining, stylish, but something less than a body of essential principles with which to design. One of the shared tenets of New Spirit or New Freedom theorists is that basic assumptions about society, and consequently also about architecture, need to be redefined. Rocks of stability-- such as the epistemology of the Enlightenment, faith in social sys- tems of order, the rational essence of architecture as it has been defined for centuries, architecture itself-are thus swept away by the chaotic tidal wave that is the latest modernity. The transcendent lesson of cultural modernism, we are told, is that we are no longer masters of our own productions.20 We are faced with the neoexistentialist realization that each of us is on his or her own and no one gets out of here alive. All that is solid melts into air.21 The rationale for changing long-held assumptions about Western society and about architecture as we have known it is that traditional definitions no longer are appropriate for the unprec- edented spirit of our time. The age, we are told, is relentlessly com- mercial. Consequently, design, as an inherently public art and thus a creature of popular culture, is above all else a commercial prod- uct. The commercial milieu is by nature quixotic, less than stable. Architecture as we have known it is, then, too permanent, too du- rable for the culture in which it would exist. In fact, it is claimed, the durable world we have known, one that has been the particular domain of building, is itself coming to an end. In the past, the coming of a millennium has produced dire and frightening predictions. Similarly, today's critics and theorists tell us to brace ourselves for tomorrow. Recent upheavals in theory and design speak of a new intellectualism that is just now flower- ing in unprecedented forms. The new architecture is evidence that some are in touch-more so than ever before, it is implied-with a society hurtling toward a completely new world. The new aesthetic and the ideas that underpin its forms make up an interesting closed loop of logic: In an anarchic age like ours, the appropriate forms and ideas are characteristically chaotic; if an- archy results from this, it is evidence that this is an age of chaos. Thus, societal and aesthetic disorder are appropriate to the age and therefore "good," or at least "honest," in the very limited way in which such judgments are still possible. Firmness, commodity, and delight are, like Vitruvius himself, ancient history. Just so there is no mistake about it, many of today's most influential critics, theorists, and architects explain that what con- cerns them is of immense significance. The written words that ac- company the newness count much less than do visual qualities but nonetheless are themselves breathless with pregnant importance. Andreas Papadakis claims that we are witness to "the conscious re- birth of the art of architecture" and that "a new way of designing is emerging.'"22 Lebbeus Woods modestly asserts that his work in- volves "the entire shape and substance of human communal and private life [as it] is and always has been determined."23 We are, it is argued, engaged in no less a task than throwing out centuries of Enlightenment and humanist baggage, a purging of cultural norms that will, as Peter Eisenman explains, displace "man away from the center of his world." According to Eisenman, "the role of art is to alienate and dislocate man from his environment so that he is jolted into seeing what it is again.'"24 Daniel Libeskind exclaims, "The period of enlightened human intellect with reality, that great Socratic and pre-Socratic contribution to seeing the world, is com- ing to an end.'"25 Such provocative pronouncements echo those of earlier avant-garde movements; the dadaists, surrealists, and impressionists in their own time all sought to see the world anew. Today's theory, which contains internal cloaked contradictions that cleverly ques- tion the very proposition being put forth-for example, the neo- avant-garde's repudiation of Modernist zeitgeist claims in favor of a new, more appropriate spirit of the present age-is nothing new. In the first half of this century, the Soviet poet Vadim Shershenevich declared, "Poetry's chief magnificent law is 'There are no laws whatever.'"26 (The statement is, of course, itself a law.) Is Eisenman's contention that humanism is on its way out itself an argument born from humanist philosophy? Is Libeskind's observa- tion concerning the end of Socratic wisdom to be derived through Socratic questioning of the condition of knowledge? Even the insistence that the age is so new that any ties to pre- cedent have been severed is itself not new. Such a claim was, of course, the basis for the tenets of Modernism, the dominant archi- tectural philosophy and aesthetic of the first two-thirds of the twen- tieth century. Moreover, the underlying messianic tone of today's millennial theory has its own, more distant precedents from the end 257 Thomas</page><page sequence="5">of the first thousand-year cycle of the western calendar and the do- ings of later medieval religious revolutionaries and mystical anar- chists. Ironically, the Judaic and Christian traditions of apocalypse are part of the foundation of Western culture, the same societal structure that, we are told, must be significantly reworked to con- form to the most recent apocalyptic vision. Millenarianism, the be- lief that the thousand-year interval would conclude in the Last Judgment, explained that life would be utterly transformed as his- tory reached its culmination. Salvation would be obtained by the reshaping of a world dominated by evil, a society completely cor- rupted by tyrannical powers capable of destroying life as it had been known.27 If this sounds familiar, it is probably because the millenarians' vision of a society in need of salvation is not dissimilar to the depictions of recent theorists, such as Lebbeus Woods, of our own age. However, salvation is apparently to be different from what it was imagined to be at the last turn of a millennium. Woods's no- tion of resurrected perfection, shaped by a preference for a specific visual style (one popularized, appropriately, not only in architecture but in the mass media, namely, the postapocalyptic Mad Max mov- ies), includes a new, better, dynamic form of human community arising from his scary "free-zones." Much of the resignation to sup- posed destructive tendencies of capitalism and cynical images of commerce found in today's New Spirit and New Freedom in design is the secular counterpart to the Middle Ages' recognition of Satan's tyrannical powers. Ironically, millenarians themselves were once said to engage in "the heresy of the Free Spirit.'"28 Even as applied to art and architecture, the termsftee spirit and new spirit predate Academy Editions.29 They have come up now and again since the Middle Ages, with their most insistent use occurring throughout this century. Ambitious claims of significance and vali- dation by attachment to science and culture usually accompany the invocation. The last turn of a century spawned numerous groups of cultural reformers, from secessionists to futurists, most of whom claimed to recognize and incorporate a truly new human condition. In 1917, Guillaume Apollinaire explained in "I'Esprit nouveau," his essay on cubism, "The new spirit struggles to open new views on the exterior and interior universe which shall not be inferior to those which scholars of every category are discovering each day ... The new spirit distinguishes itself from all the artistic and literary move- ments which have preceded it.""' Less than a decade later, Le Corbusier used the term for his Pavillion de L'Esprit Nouveau at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs. Meanwhile, Germany's most important architectural theorists were busy formulating a Neue Sachlichkeit, a new objectivity, that would lay the groundwork for a new freedom in design. Off in the metaphorical mountains, Paul Scheerbart, Bruno Taut, and members of the secret society Glass Chain hypothesized a fantastic glass architecture that would "provide us with a new culture."31 By the eighties, with Modernism an aging dowager, most of the revolutionary new spirit was little more than charming nostalgic memories. However, another New Spirit arose phoenixlike from its ashes. Ironically, the new New Spirit was de- scribed in terms of old new spirits: It had "the thrusting, dynamic imagery of Constructivism and ... Futurism's savage beauty." It was Dadaesque, it was surreal, said the acolytes of the New.32 Many of today's thinkers and makers of the New share with their predecessors a myopic view of the world, an assumption that what is happening in their time is unlike anything that has ever happened to anyone before. Libeskind writes, "Something has hap- pened culturally, across the barriers of old that has fundamentally altered the mood and modality of people's feelings, desires, and consequently, thoughts."33 This is exciting talk, but it may be less than accurate. Today's theory, like any theory primarily shaped by the avant-garde (as has been the case for the last one hundred years), speaks first and foremost only to its own makers. It is impossible for the avant-garde to accommodate the prevailing human condition, to represent any feelings, desires, and thoughts other than those of its own self-defined narrow sliver of society. In fact, an avant-garde that gains too substantial a footing in the world in which it exists is self-negating. As Matei Calinescu explains, "Ironically, [in the six- ties] the avant-garde found itself failing through a stupendous, in- voluntary success. This situation prompted some artists and critics to question not only the historical role of the avant-garde but the adequacy of the concept itself."34 The makers of much recent theory fall into a familiar trap, believing that they rest atop the pinnacle of history, poised as none before to leap into the future. Such a view was the principal cause of large blind spots scattered throughout the often brilliant histo- ries and theories of Giedion, Pevsner, and Le Corbusier, as well as the work of lesser purveyors of the Modernist gospels. It is a belief that can seduce otherwise rational and insightful thinkers and build- ers into assuming that they are, in the words of the historian Herbert Butterfield, "co-operators with progress itself."" Being a partner of progress, capturing the essence of an age identified (or claimed) as fundamentally new, particularly one that is also the culmination of history, creates a great and dangerous free- dom. The designer is able-in fact, is required-to create com- pletely new standards by which to build and judge, values that because of the nature of the avant-garde must reject precedent. For a media-driven culture dependent on a supply of new images, the set of circumstances is just right. Problematically, this often does May 1997 JAE 50/4 258</page><page sequence="6">not square with the tangible reality of architecture. Time and again building proves to be dependent on continuity rather than radical change. Architecture is self-referential, a discipline based on prece- dent. In reaction to nineteenth-century revivalism, the last hundred years of Western architectural theory have largely been shaped by attempts to create unprecedented building forms, or at least forms appropriate to "modern" materials and to a modern zeitgeist. Yet even the most canonical of Modernists, such as Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Louis Kahn, admitted a debt to classical prin- ciples. Frank Lloyd Wright acknowledged the influence of tradi- tional Japanese architecture even as he proclaimed himself the quintessential modern architect. The problems to be solved are often great, especially when architecture is expected to drive a social agenda. Pressure to adopt a new system of values often leads to foolish naivete or arrogance. Le Corbusier thus dismissed urbanism's single most important ele- ment, the street, because "our hearts are always oppressed by the constriction of its enclosing walls," and then rejected it completely because "when all is said and done we have to admit it disgusts Us."36 Modernist avant-garde planners abstracted and systematized the troublesome human component out of urban theory. Legions of urban-renewal bureaucrats would follow suit. In England after World War II, between a blitzed-out urban landscape and a social- ist government, some Angry Young Men (and Alison Smithson) concocted the New Realism and extracted from it the transcen- dently brutal Park Hill housing in Sheffield. Not to worry, the En- glish enfants terribles explained, they were merely giving "form to our generation's idea of order."37 More recently, Eisenman an- nounced that, in contrast to the past three hundred years of Ameri- can domestic architecture, when designing a house he refuses to pander to the wishes of the client. Rather, he "basically attempts to destabilize the notion of home.'"38 Other significant tendencies seen before in this century are being repeated, not invented. The forms and design philosophies of the New Spirit in architecture are hardly without precedent. Theo van Doesburg's opaque theory of neoplasticism would be right at home with many of the nineties' dense pronouncements. Lebbeus Woods and Antonio Sant'Elia would find one another's urban ro- mantic drawing style familiar, and later Woods and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti might well compare notes on the cleansing power of heavy artillery. By now it is commonplace to call attention to the resemblance between early Modernism's constructivist phase and recent works. In the last decade of the twentieth century, we may not be atop the mountain of history, but we have been travel- ing to where we are for some time now. No matter to what lengths building is intellectualized, archi- tectural design remains primarily a matter of aesthetics shaped by, and shaping, three-dimensional forms. Since aesthetics might be considered a matter of taste, a difficult concept not easily supported by academic argument, elaborate "theoretical" rationalizations are constructed to defend the choice of style or fashion. Criticism or even skepticism is dismissed as partisan opposition emanating from a committed antitheoretical lobby.39 Dismissal of contrary criticism through the appropriation of "the spirit of the age" is hardly new. David Watkin explains in Architecture and Morality that the defense of visual aesthetics has been commonplace over the last two centu- ries. Watkin points out that A.W.N. Pugin, Viollet-le-Duc, and Nikolaus Pevsner (three very different personalities, only two of whom favored similar architectural styles) each justified his position by claiming that his aesthetic preference was the inevitable response to the shape of contemporary society. In part, theirs were philoso- phies designed to compensate for an overemphasis on personal pref- erences for a particular style of architecture, one in which visual appeal was primary but was suppressed, disguised in the nineteenth century behind veils of religion and nationalism and in the twenti- eth century by naive faith in the social collective and the promise of technology.40 In this light, the latest theory that demonstrates tendencies to misinterpret culture, misapply technology, or support simplistic political agendas looks all too familiar. New Empathy Physical forms possess a character only because we ourselves possess a body.... We read our own image into allphenom- ena. We expect everything to possess what we know to be the conditions ofour own well-being. -Heinrich Wolfflin, "Prolegomena to a Psychology of Architecture" (1886) When the word empathy was coined, it was regarded not as a ratio- nal thought process but rather as a less precise feeling or emotion.41 Subsequently, Theodor Lipps redefined the term as the objective enjoyment of self, contending that beauty was a matter of encoun- tering the self in an object, while ugliness was the result of feeling the self repelled.42 In such an explanation, theorists tacitly acknowl- edge the validity of characteristics found in classicism, wherein hu- man traits give shape, scale, and meaning to a specific vocabulary of architecture. Moreover, the empathetic correspondence of a build- ing element to the body-a column to a standing person, for ex- 259 Thomas</page><page sequence="7">.1~ '... . ..'

Vitruvian Man: homo ad circum. ample-is but a single instance of a larger architectural composition, other elements of which also relate to the human existential condi- tion. Christian Norberg-Schulz explains that each component of a building "forms part of a 'family' of characters, which are deliber- ately related to human qualities." Thus, "the original forces are ... 'humanized,' and present themselves as individual participants in a comprehensive, meaningful world."43 Such a direct correspondence is the most essential aspect of empathy as it relates to the understand- ing of architecture. Yet the direct representation of the human form in building is but one aspect of empathy in architecture. Geoffrey Scott ex- plained that our experience of architecture is not merely a matter of logical correspondence. Rather, "it is experienced, consciously, as a direct and simple intuition, which has its ground in that subcon- scious region where our physical memories are stored." Conse- quently, Scott contended, understanding architecture is primarily a matter of a more subtle empathy: "We feel the value of certain curves and certain relations of pressure to resistance by an uncon- scious (or usually unconscious) analogy with our own movements, our own gestures, our own experiences of weight."44 Scott's explanation suggests how significant and complicated a determinant of architecture is empathy. Yet for many of today's critics, explanations of making and experiencing architecture like Scott's are apparently no longer valid. Eisenman's disciples claim that his theories reveal that empathy, as it is employed in classical architecture, is no more than "a desire for our own fallacious and self-alienating self-image," an architectural process that "denies the sensitivity of the human soul."45 In fact, it might be argued that in our media-saturated time we do not engage in direct communica- tion with our environment anyway. We can neither feel nor recog- nize ourselves in physical form-unless that form is simulated for us and we are told how to relate to it (or, at best, given a menu of reac- tions from which to choose). Theorists like Eisenman and Woods reject positive interpretations of the empathetic architectural expe- rience. As a consequence, the resulting architecture often appears designed to dominate, or even to humiliate, rather than to ennoble. The concept of human form as the measure of things has been repeated over and over since fifteenth-century humanists rediscovered Vitruvius. The most familiar visual image of this idea is Leonardo's depiction of man circumscribed by circle and square: Vitruvian Man, the homo ad circum. Leonardo's Vitruvian Man may be read as the iconographic depiction of humanist ideals of harmony between the laws of nature and the human condition, as, for example, did Cesare Cesariano in his sixteenth-century edition of Vitruvius in which he described man in the circle as the measure "through whose geometri- cal limbs we shall learn how to, as we say, commensurate everything else on earth."46 The image may also be interpreted in a more literal manner. Four centuries after Leonardo, Le Corbusier's love affair with "new architectural forms" included ocean liners, "elements both vast and intimate but on man's scale."47 More recently, Charles Moore lauded the house, the most personal of building types, as "the one piece of the world around us which still speaks directly of our bodies as the center and the measure of that world."48 Today, however, just as in literary theory the author is removed from the text, in architec- ture, in order for the New Spirit to achieve correspondence with our troublesome age, man is to be removed from the center of the circle. Moreover, now at a distance from the center, man is depicted, not as the proud protagonist claiming a place in the universe, but as a humbled and often battered figure. In a curious contradiction, even as theory proposes to displace the individual from the center of the universe, recent intellectual fashion has rediscovered the importance of that same individual. Al- though the idea has deep roots in Nietzsche and subsequent exis- tential philosophers, today the intellectual focus on the individual emerges at a time when the twentieth century's great political ad- May 1997 JAE 50/4 260</page><page sequence="8">-4 1 / //e /// -4- i// i- /"1 10 F-?__Jm-/I 6oo-, .60000' -........7 2.

Lebbeus Woods, "Untitled," from Anarchitecture: Architecture Is a Political Act (1992). (By permission from Academy Editions/ St. Martin's Press.) venture in collectivism has collapsed throughout the world. If the spirit of the age is to be captured (and the New Spirit might un- charitably be characterized as warmed-over zeitgeist theory), such an event of global political significance as the failure of the communist experiment is not to be ignored-nor is the opportunity to appro- priate it to be missed. Thus the inhabitant of Lebbeus Woods's Zagreb Free Zone occupies a solitary cell but is connected to the world by the new omnipresent electronic media. Alas, despite this late-twentieth-century reemergence of the individual, the human condition is, apparently, hardly triumphant. Instead, empathy is now recast as a recognition of assault, violence, and abuse perpetrated by an emerging malevolent global culture. The individual's most ardent champion, Ayn Rand, would recog- nize this, but she would be appalled at the latest response to the presumed cultural condition: a masochistic celebration of the "vio- lated individual" and the concomitant abdication of responsibility for the shape of a larger society. To Lipps, Scott, and others con- cerned with the deep understanding of architecture, empathy was important as an explanation for the affinity between people and the buildings that shaped their world. Although the definition of em- pathy was not necessarily narrow, it was nonetheless most often cast as a positive architectural determinant. New spins now depict empathetic correspondence in a negative light. Whereas "old em- pathy" was an ennobling characteristic, "new empathy" is a weary recognition of abuse. Aaron Betsky's description of a 1987 sculpture at Cedars- Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles illustrates the new conception of empathy. Placed three floors underground, the sculpture, as Betsky describes it, "lacks motivation. It does not seem to represent anything." He explains that the sculpture "reverses our sense of proportion, gravity and coherence." Contradicting himself, Betsky adds that it is, however, anthropomorphic: "Its legs, torso, and head stand in for our body, revealing skeletal and planar ele- ments which are the essence of the building housing our body.... The construction thus serves as a hybrid model for ourselves and that which contains us-a map of ourselves and our environment that suggests a way out of our body and the world of our creation." It is, according to Betsky, an appropriate metaphor both for the cancer clinic in which it stands and the age that has produced it: The context "is a world inhabited by the terminally ill, people whose insides are transformed by an uncontrollable and alien trans- mutation." The building that houses the sculpture, Betsky points 261 Thomas</page><page sequence="9">out, is itself "not an affirming architecture."49 Elsewhere in his ap- propriately titled Violated Perfection: Architecture and the Fragmen- tation of the Modern, Betsky explains that a new form of architecture he calls "technomorphism" concerns "a strange hybrid of'building/ body/machines'. . . technomorphic tools [that] stand in for, con- sume, and deny both the body and the world."5' Empathy, whose significance in the identification and production of beauty was un- derstood at the beginning of this century to entail the recognition of the self in an object, is now at the end of the century a denial of the body and the world-or at best a reappraisal resulting in a pa- thetic surrender of humanism. "This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.""5 Given the depiction of the human condition and the world in much recent theory, denial of any correspondence to architecture would indeed seem to be the best move. Woods explains that he works in a world in which change is "violent and terrible, bringing .. . the most dreadful suffering and loss ... [that] erode the ground on which civilization and personal existence rest, leaving voids of rea- son." Furthermore, previous attempts to better this condition were little more than shams: The Enlightenment idea of progress is "noth- ing more than a veil covering eyes that would otherwise look upon their own madness." For Woods, "a theory that can never fail, and at the same time can never succeed, . . . is the perfect theory of the human condition today--a paradox which is a prelude to an enigma. Such a theory inevitably produces the twins: war and architecture." The destructive tendencies of humanity and the creative impulse thus unite in a new design method. Destruction is creation. War is peace. Chillingly, Woods openly attributes his philosophy to Doublethink, explaining that George Orwell's nightmare vision "was nothing more nor less than a confirmation of the irreparable dam- age done by modern thought to the idea of classical coherence."'52 For another example of the "new empathy," consider a course in architectural theory offered at the Architectural Association in London by Mark Cousins. The prospectus for "Danger and Safety" states that the course, which "give[s] the slip to attempts to orga- nize aesthetics and ethics around the category of the subject, this fading star of the Enlightenment," is "an attempt to link politics, ethics and art through the axis of danger and safety." Cousins ex- plains, "Recent art and cultural production present a fundamental relation to danger-danger to the body, of the body . .. a body in danger, damaged, violated, invaded, eroded. ... The trace of the body is no longer idealized as the Human Form, but materialized as visceral and fearful." In the course, "the malice of the virtues of conscience and principle are rejected in favor of tolerance, negotia- tion and positions of weakness." (The "safety" in the course title is concerned with "a post-ethical politics." As Cousins notes, "Daunted, unillusioned and sad, this emerging politics also stresses the body, rather than the classical subject.")53 Numerous studies of the phenomenology of perception have revealed fascinating links between pain and imagination.54 Moreover, the human form in torment has been a staple of artistic representa- tion, from the Laocoon to images of St. Sebastian to Picasso's Guernica to Chris Burden's performance piece in which he is shot in the shoul- der. For architecture, however, it is different. When pain and abuse become the dominant characteristics of empathy, we descend into an overly emotional, malevolently mannered state, a condition that is far from the highest expression of the art form, and we are left with the antihero as measure of all things. Albert Camus's L'Etranger, rather than Eisenman's cipher, is the obvious model for this new Vitruvian man-placed suitably outside the circle, of course. As poststructuralism filtered into fashion in many branches of the humanities, Michel Foucault cleverly put forth the premise that the subjugated or marginalized are more able to observe the real workings of a society than are either the mainstream or less alien- ated. Moreover, in Discipline and Punish, Foucault further defined marginalized man as the "body condemned," tracing a history of the victimized individual back centuries to the scaffold, the wheel, and the panopticon.55 As mutual infatuation grew between architectural theory and poststructuralist theory in other disciplines, the tradi- tional understanding of empathy in architecture began to appear hopelessly dated. An understanding of empathy as an essential char- acteristic of architecture escapes many from outside the discipline; empathy thus becomes just another piece of Enlightenment/hu- manist baggage to be jettisoned. Jumping on the poststructuralist bandwagon (itself now rather outdated), the purveyors of the archi- tectural New follow suit. The New Spirit presents the troubling possibility that, given the media-directed nature of our times, half-baked proclamations that render the human condition as inherently abused and violated might be accepted without question. Any culture grows upward from roots, but it is also formed top-down under the direction of an intellectual and political elite. Choices made in the making of the landscape are tangible and long lasting. If, as Woods contends, Doublespeak is a confirmation of our condition, then the possibili- ties for serious mischief are boundless. In most instances, the new empathy masquerades as a concern for the downtrodden: Now, finally, the disenfranchised will have their say. Daniel Libeskind calls for a new landscape shaped "not for the victors who have dominated architecture for five thousand years, but the vanquished-an architecture for losers."''56 Such a philosophy May 1997 JAE 50/4 262</page><page sequence="10">of building is no more than a politically correct smoke screen. Per- verting so essential an architectural characteristic as empathy will not usher in a new egalitarian world any more than did previous naive Modernist political-architectural formulas. Theory that celebrates the visceral and fearful, that finds malice in conscience and principle, that activates an architecture for losers, is indeed a departure from what we have known and hoped building to be. It is a telling indication of the nature of much recent theory that architects outside elite Western intellectual circles, those most directly concerned with the true "marginalized" who are the Third World, seem to have little time for nihilistic posturing. In many cases, the intellectual attachment to the marginalized individual is no more than an expedient measure that dovetails with today's fash- ion in academia and visual aesthetics. Within consumption-driven Western society, claims that recent avant-garde architectural theory embodies the essential societal characteristics of our age are at best culturally naive or presumptuous, at worst self-delusion or deceit.

I first encountered this term in a review by David Holahan in the Phila- delphia Inquirer, Oct. 1, 1993. Holahan dubbed a book that purported to prove that Mark Twain was gay "tabloid humanism." The expression suggests a mutated mean- ing of humanism, one shaped by the sensibilities of makers of lurid or sensational tab- loid headlines rather than by the thoughtful consideration of the human condition. 19.

This phrase is borrowed from the title of Marshall Berman's All That Is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity (New York: Simon and Schuster 1982). Berman borrows his title from Marx's contention that to be modern is to be part of a universe in which "all that is solid melts into air." Berman writes of characters as varied as Joseph Paxton, Baron Haussmann, Robert Moses, Goethe, Marx, and Baudelaire, all of whom "know the thrill and dread of a world in which 'all that is solid melts into air"' (Penguin edition, 1988, p. 13). 22.
