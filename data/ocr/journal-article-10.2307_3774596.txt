<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Bronze Head-Vase FRANCES F. JONES There is a fairly large category of Roman bronze heads or bronze busts, hollow, to serve as vessels, and equipped with handles and lids. Found principally in the Roman provinces, they represent different kinds of persons: youths, gods, mythical creatures, Negroes (a propor- tionately large group), and others. It is the busts of the Dionysiac entourage that are of interest here, for The Art Museum acquired an example of this type many years ago.2 The Princeton bust (figs. I-4) is of a youthful satyr who wears an animal skin fastened over his left shoul- der. Thick hair falls in wavy locks around his face and neck and brings to mind the style that Antinous, fa- vorite of Hadrian, made popular in second-century Roman sculpture. The handle from which the container was suspended is now lost, but the lower parts of the at- tachments are visible as leaf-shaped tabs that blend with the tufts of hair. Likewise, the small lid, which formed the crown of the head, is gone, leaving only the hinge at the back. The vessel is closed at the bottom by a sim- ple sheet of bronze. Caught in a raking light, the simple sheet proves to be of unusual interest, for it preserves lines of neatly incised Latin, very shallowly cut and difficult to read because of corrosion and damage. The inscription is part of a military diploma of the initial years of the third century A.D. (see the accompanying commentary by Joyce Reynolds). After it had lost its value as a document, a piece of the diploma was cut out to replace the original base of the vase. Loss of the base is common for such vessels.3 This lack has been used as an argument that they were in- tended to be token offerings, not functioning utensils, but other signs of wear and repair tend to confirm long and even hard use. The Princeton example was consid- ered worth repairing. Some vases were converted to weights by filling them with lead, the means for sus- pension from a steelyard being already conveniently provided by the vases' original handles or by the loops for their attachment.4 The interpretation of the purpose and use of this class of object has vacillated between unguent vase (balsamarium) and censer. A censer would account for the vulnerability of the bases and also for the occa- sional round pedestal-foot, rather than a flat base, which raises the bottom of the vessel and would pro- vide insulation when the functioning censer was not suspended. Since, however, there are no ventilation holes, the lid would have to be left open for the incense to burn and diffuse. As unguent vases, they would be- long to a centuries-old tradition of anthropomorphic containers for women's cosmetics and athletes' oils for a rubdown after sports.5 There are head-vases made of blown glass, which would have been less expensive equivalents, but certainly could not have served as cen- sers; they appear as early as the late first century A.D., but are usually associated with later contexts.6 There are about two dozen published examples of the Princeton type, some particularly close.7 In addi- tion, there is an unpublished example known to the au- thor as having been on the Damascus art market in I953 (fig. 5).8 In most instances, but not invariably, the head in this group of vases is turned slightly to the left shoulder. In all, the hair is arranged in tiers over the forehead; it falls over the ears and to at least the nape of the neck. The thick locks are more naturalistically in- dicated on, for example, the Loeb bronze (see list at the end of this article) than on the Princeton head, where the treatment is flat and less plastic. The eyeballs are usually modelled and the irises indicated by drilled holes. The heavy-lidded hollow eyes of the Princeton piece and the example once in Damascus probably were filled with silver or paste.9 Some of the busts have amulets fastened around the neck, an ornament that is not associated with any particular subdivision within the group. The nebris worn by some of the ex- amples is the only suggestion that the greater number of the Princeton group has a Bacchic association; there are variant types more clearly associated with wood- land creatures and the entourage of the god of wine- fauns,10 Pan,1" and probably the ivy-wreathed god himself. 12 There are no duplicates among the examples assem- bled here, not even allowing for variations that could be introduced by a sequence of molds and by tooling after the busts were cast. There are stylistic differences, especially in the faces, which suggest the same chrono- 17</page><page sequence="2">9I (Juoljq uIÂ§D :so3oqd) '(e95zE-55) A1S.I9ATUfl uOIaou.ld 'tunfsnW 3v JL, 'tu t-EI '-H 'uav Ain3uao puoc3S (wntvwPvs,pq) asEA-peCq azuojq u?mol -t-I sainSj</page><page sequence="3">Figure 5.

If one adds other types of head-vase, especially the Negroid, the horizon broadens to Britain in the north and the site of Dura-Europos to the east. The trade was provincial rather than Italian. Alexandria has been suggested as the source, not only because of the proportionately large number of Ne- groid vases, but also because of the city's convenient location as an entrepot for unguents from the east. Glass was surely the inexpensive container for trans- shipping small quantities of unguents and perfumes brought to the Mediterranean in larger amounts. Were the bronze busts and heads intended as purveyors, or were they simply utensils made and distributed as ob- jets de luxe in themselves?15 Clearly there are questions yet to be answered. Meanwhile, the Princeton vessel is offered as a piece of Roman metalwork that was trea- sured and had an unusual life-history. NOTES logical evolution from Hadrianic classicism to the later, mannered formula that developed in major sculpture. Absolute chronology is meager. Although the find- spot may be known, in most such instances the archae- ological context is not, and therefore the evidence of a grave-group, such as one in Bulgaria,13 serves more to confirm stylistic conjecture than to establish dating. As noted by Filippo Coarelli,14 scholarly consensus places the group within the second and third centuries A.D. It will be noted from the appended list of comparanda that the provenance, when known or reasonably con- jectured, falls within the Roman provinces that are nowadays Egypt, the Iberian peninsula, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Germany, and Luxembourg. Not surpris- I should like to thank Robert Guy for bringing to my attention the head-vases once on the Ascona market (1979), in Dumbarton Oaks, the Indiana University Art Museum, and in the William Herbert Hunt Collection; and also for kindly supplying several bibliographical refer- ences. Hugo Meyer signaled the existence of the example in the Ar- chaeological Museum, Vama, and made generous loan of the postcard from which it is here illustrated. For information on and for permis- sion to reproduce photographs of objects in their care, I thank Susan Boyd (Washington, D.C., Dumbarton Oaks), Adriana Calinescu (Bloomington, Indiana University Art Museum); Denys Haynes, for- merly Keeper of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, and Dyfri Williams (London, British Museum); Thomas Howard-Sneyd (London).

Considering the number of Etruscan "balsamaria" that have survived from the Hellenistic pe- riod, it is curious that Italy is so lacking in the Roman relatives; see S. Haynes and H.

The grave-group published by Christo M. Danoff ("Grabfund aus W'arbovka in Nordbulgarien," Archdologischer Anzeiger (I937), cols. 339-348) included two strigils and a well-worn bust of the Princeton category; a burial from Rila, Bulgaria, also contained a similar bust and two strigils (I. Welkow, Annuaire du Musee Nationale [Sofia, 1921], 202-204, figs. 207, 210). In discussing the group of bronze Negro-head examples, L. Pressouyre considered them to be unguent-vases and cited an example containing perfumed pow- der, found at Aisey-le-Duc, C6te-d'Or (L. Pressouyre, "A propos d'un 'balsamaire' trouve," I8o). 6. Cf. C.

In the museum at Stara-Zagora, Bulgaria, the author saw a clay version, in this case a bust of Dionysos, that came from a tomb found locally and dated second century A.D. It suggests a grave-gift that was less costly, not only because of its material, but also be- cause its place of manufacture might have been closer.
