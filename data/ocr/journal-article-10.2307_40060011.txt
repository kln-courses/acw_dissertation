<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AND AMERICAN FICTION Denis Donoghue I For the purposes of this essay (and for some purposes beyond it), I take religion to be Christianity, the expedient - as Nietzsche called it in The Ge- nealogy of Morals - "that paradoxical and awful expedient, through which a tortured humanity has found a temporary alleviation, that stroke of genius called Christianity - God personally immolating himself for the debt of man, God paying himself personally out of a pound of his own flesh" (111). It follows that I do not allude to other religions or to the sinister possibility of "religion without religion" to which Derrida refers in The Gift of Death as "this immense and thorny question" (49). Whether Christianity is an achieved entity or a mysterium tremendum always yet to be fulfilled is a question I don't address. I begin with some general considerations that don't bear peculiarly on American fiction. They are perhaps mere five-finger-exercises in the vicinity of the topic, but I hope by this means to make a space for some that do. I assume that literature is language subject to the double ministry of fiction and form. It is life as a writer imagines it within the constraints of the language in which it is written. The factor common to religion and literature is language. But that apparently simple notion does not report a harmonious relation between the two values. Geoffrey Hill, brooding over the twenty volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary in its second edition, was persuaded that "sematology is a theological dimension: the use of language R&amp;L 38.1 (Spring 2006) 31</page><page sequence="2">32 Religion &amp; Literature is inseparable from that 'terrible aboriginal calamity' in which, according to Newman, the human race is implicated" (20). In a light-hearted world a language would be comprehensive. There would be words and sentences in it fully expressive of whatever perceptions, judgments, feelings, sentiments, and desires are humanly possible. But that does not appear to be the case, as Wittgenstein held when he maintained that whereof one may not speak, thereof one must be silent. In The Things They Carried, Tim O'Brien's nar- rator records that Rat Kiley shot a baby buffalo several times for no clear reason. All he can say is: We had witnessed something essential, something brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not yet a name for it. (86) Maybe there was a name for it that O'Brien could not find. It is still a matter of debate whether or not there are feelings that never transpire in language. There is always silence, the silence into which the words, after speech, reach, according to the "Burnt Norton" of T. S. Eliot. Or John Cage's silence, which is presumably different from mine or anyone else's. Heather McHugh has a poem about the burning of Giordano Bruno, how his captors put an iron mask on his face to prevent him from speaking. The poem ends: Poetry is what he thought, but did not say. (4) Nonetheless, language seems to be more enabling than one could anticipate. D. W. Harding has argued in Experience Into Words that writers are distin- guished from other people by bringing language to bear upon their thinking at an unusually early stage of the transaction. They don't conceive thoughts independently of language and then search about for the best means of expressing them; it is as if the words pressed themselves forward and the thoughts came, a split second later, to complete the action. But words often seem to be not the right ones, and in that character they offer a show of truculence that they have no apparent right to offer. In Style and Faith, Hill quotes Benjamin Whichcote as saying that "by wickedness [a man] passes into a Nature contrary to his own," and comments that "when you write at any serious pitch of obligation you enter into the nature of grammar and etymology, which is a nature contrary to your own." You cannot "extricate yourself from this 'contrary nature' by some kind of philosophical fiat or gesture of spiritual withdrawal" (123). Language in that character is enemy country. This makes a problem for religion, which the churches resolve as best they can by allowing an aura to suffuse their rituals and prayers. There is another difficulty. Kenneth Burke noted that there is no special</page><page sequence="3">DENIS DONOGHUE 33 vocabulary for the supernatural. Indeed, the words "supernatural" and "preternatural" are merely inflections of "natural." The ineffable has to go without saying because the only sayings are defeated substitutes for it. That is one reason why, as Pater maintained, "all art constantly aspires toward the condition of music," form and content in that medium being one and the same (106). There are a few words which seem to be applicable to religious experience, such as (in the Christian calendar) God, divine, spirit, sacrifice, prayer, sacrament, Word - as in Word of God - grace, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But these words - with the possible exception of "God" - is- sue from natural or social experience, and then are applied figuratively and rather desperately to one's religious occasions. "And the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us" is clear enough if faith clarifies it; otherwise not. Emerson anticipated Burke in his sense of the limitations of language, but he was not dismayed by them. In his first book, Nature, he observed that "words are signs of natural facts. ... Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material appearance" (4). In Paradise Lost, God has to speak English and, worse still, has to use ordinary English words. When he speaks to His son in Book III, his speech is that of any devoted father to any dutiful son. He cannot transcend the diction and syntax of seventeenth-century English. When He explains to His son the faculty of free will and the conditions under which Man lives with it - Man shall not be quite lost, but saved who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsafed - (61) the words "will" - first a verb, then a noun - and "grace" get their meaning from social life, even if theologians and moral philosophers treat both as technical terms. In Book V, Raphael tells Adam that Man's speech is dis- cursive while that of angels is intuitive (lines 487-89). To explain to Adam "what surmounts the reach / Of human sense" - I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best. . . (118) Dr. Johnson was troubled by this, and thought "the confusion of spirit and matter" caused "incongruity" in the whole narrative. Raphael himself wasn't at ease with the device. He immediately wondered - . . . though what if earth</page><page sequence="4">34 Religion &amp; Literature Be but the shadow of heav'n, and things therein Each to the other like, more than on earth is thought? (118) He seems to mean that the analogy between spiritual and corporal forms is doubtful, because things in heaven don't differ, one from another, as much as their counterparts on earth appear to do. Still, he retains the analogy, if only because no other way of explaining spiritual forms is conceivable. A nuance of this situation arises again in Nature where Emerson sets the analogy stirring freely, things in nature are signs of spiritual correlatives: Sensible objects conform to the premonitions of Reason and reflect the conscience. All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature. Therefore is nature glorious with form, color, and motion; that every globe in the remotest heaven, every chemical change from the rudest crystal up to the laws of life, every change of vegetation from the first principle of growth in the eye of a leaf, to the tropical forest and antediluvian coal-mine, every animal function from the sponge up to Hercules, shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and wrong, and echo the Ten Commandments. Therefore is Nature ever the ally of Religion: lends all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment. (22-23) Near the end of that passage, Emerson drives the analogy from sweet to sour - we hear of religion through the laws of right and wrong and the Ten Commandments, but in the last sentence he reverts to easy alliances and sentiments. The whole passage depends on the assertion, not self-evident, that "all things are moral." The history of Romanticism shows that many writers acted on Emerson's congenial assumptions: the more they delighted in landscapes, the more they thought of themselves as somehow, however informally, acknowledging God and expressing everything "upon the bosom of a Nature perceived as holy," as Cynthia Ozick has described it (193). There were moments, especially in Wordsworth and Coleridge, when the hoped-for revelation between the world and one's presence in it went blank, and these moments constituted a crisis. The question was: whose fault was the blank - the human mind looking wrongly - impiously or sullenly - at the world or God arbitrarily withholding His good will? Hopkins is the most extreme example of this in English poetry. He had his blank moments and usually blamed himself, but sometimes God. But he had many moments of fulfilled presence in a landscape he deemed the work of God. He also believed in God - with the certitude that adds two to three and gets five - independently of the landscapes he took pleasure in. It was harder to retain this sentiment when the landscapes gave way to cities, heavy industry, noise, and traffic, but the Romantic conviction remained in place - and still does, for particular writers - despite I. A. Richards's insistence, in Science and Poetry, on the "neu-</page><page sequence="5">DENIS DONOGHUE 35 tralization of nature." Richards thought it a mark of modern writers that they had given up thinking of nature and God as kin, and he regarded as anachronistic the writers who held on to such a belief. Richards's position is a blunt version of the "secularization of inherited theological ideas and ways of thinking" that M. H. Abrams has elucidated in Natural Supernaturalism (12). Richard Rorty has carried the secularizing process further by asserting that "the world does not speak; only we do" (Rorty 6-7; Larmore 51). The trouble with that quip is that it doesn't help us to decide whether what we say is true or false. l The consideration that there is no diction specific to experience of the supernatural leads to another issue. Burke has again clarified it. I quote from The Rhetoric of Religion: Insofar as man is the "typically symbol-using animal," it should not be surprising that men's thoughts on the nature of the Divine embody the principles of verbalization. And insofar as "God" is a. formal principle, any thorough statements about "God" should be expected to reveal the formality underlying their genius as statements. The Biblical avowal that man is made in God's image has made us wary of the reversed anthropomorphic tendency to conceive of God'm man's image. But the present inquiry stands midway between those two positions, contending merely that, insofar as reli- gious doctrine is verbal, it will necessarily exemplify its nature as verbalization; and insofar as religious doctrine is thorough, its ways of exemplifying verbal principles should be correspondingly thorough. (1) But many modern writers have not been wary of the anthropomorphic tendency to conceive of God in man's image, and that is precisely what they have done, especially in the act of exalting man beyond any reason- able conception of Him. When Stevens writes in "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour," "God and the imagination are one" (524), it is as if he reported that the only meaning we are willing to ascribe to the word "God" is the word "imagination" and then claimed that the human imagination is somehow divine or as close as one can imagine to divinity. II Stevens's sayings (and much else) prompt me toward a proposition so stark that I must try to mellow it at once. The proposition is that modern American literature is a substitute for religion, but a substitute in which the original has been absorbed.2 What could that mean? It could mean that while the "cultural unconscious" in America may be religious, the culture so far as it is conscious is secular. It may observe its Sabbath for an hour or two once a week, but the rest of the week is dedicated to worldly pursuits. It could mean that its "political concepts are secularized theologico-politi- cal concepts" (Derrida 103). Or that the distinctive merits of American</page><page sequence="6">36 Religion &amp; Literature literature are regularly sought in default of the credences of religion. Or that some writers who do not hold any religious beliefs regard that state as a predicament and do the best they can with it, as Stevens wrote his po- ems without Christian convictions, despite the plaintive yearning for such which he ascribed to the woman in "Sunday Morning." The proposition could also mean (to acknowledge that these sentiments are not confined to American writers) what Matthew Arnold said in "The Study of Poetry," and Santayana virtually repeated in Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, that the strongest part of our religion is its unconscious poetry. "Our religion is the poetry in which we believe," Santayana claimed. He looked upon religion "as on a kind of poetry. . .that expresses moral values and reacts beneficently upon life" (26, 105). The proposition does not say that modern literature is a valid or effective substitute for religion, or even that it is a poor substitute, of necessity. Nor does it say that literature is the only substitute that has been tried. Allen Tate maintained in "Religion and the Old South" that because the South "never created a fitting religion, the social structure of the South began grievously to break down two generations after the Civil War," "for the social structure depends on the economic structure, and economic conviction is still, in spite of the beliefs of economists from Adam Smith to Marx, the secular image of religion" (570). In the same essay, Tate said that Southerners inherited Thomas Jefferson's belief that the ends of man are sufficiently contained in his political destiny and "may be fully achieved by political means" (575). This is now a common sentiment, especially among philosophers in the Pragmatist tradition who want to turn philosophy into politics and who regard truth as nothing but an axiom of intersubjectivity, in force for the time being only. But in another context, W. B. Yeats com- ing upon Thomas Mann's assertion that "the destiny of man presents its meaning in political terms," wrote a poem called "Politics" to say, in effect, that you could make the same claim for any comprehensive term, such as sex (631). So we have religion, politics, economics, and sex as ambitious values. It is to be expected that one of these will be in the cultural ascendant at a particular moment. But if with Schelling and Coleridge a writer chooses religion as supreme in principle if rarely in practice, it is because, as Northrop Frye maintained, "the transcendental and apocalyptic perspective of religion comes as a tremendous emancipation of the imaginative mind" (125). Or because the ultimate term appears to be religious and analogous to the divine act of creation. As Coleridge says, again following Schelling, in the Biographia Literaria, willing to see religious belief absorbed in worldly or humanist terminologies:</page><page sequence="7">DENIS DONOGHUE 37 The IMAGINATION then I consider either as primary, or secondary. The primary IMAGINATION I hold to be the living Power and prime Agent of all human Per- ception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. ( 1 : 304) It is a pity that Coleridge called the two forms of imagination primary and secondary. The one he calls primary can hardly be primary if it repeats in the finite mind the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM. The eternal act must be primary, first in principle, so the later kinds should respectively be secondary and tertiary. But the analogy with the divine power is still deemed to hold, and it guarantees to the human imagination a trace of religious af- filiation, even in the line I quoted from Stevens. The other ambitious terms, by comparison, are merely social instruments, however preponderant they may be in social practice. Ill Modern American fiction is hardly the place one would visit to find these issues taken seriously. Why they are taken lightly, on the whole, is a ques- tion for Emerson. But I begin with a story in which religion in the forms of doctrine, ritual, and sacramental practice is taken very seriously indeed. Andre Dubus's "A Father's Story" is told in the first person by Luke Ripley, a man in his middle years who lives in northeastern Massachusetts. In his worldly life he owns a stable of thirty horses. He has young people who teach riding and he boards horses, too. He seems to make a fairly comfortable living, but he lives by himself. His wife Gloria left him some years ago and took the children with her to Florida - three sons and a daughter, Jennifer, who is now twenty and comes every summer to Massachusetts to visit her father for six weeks. Meanwhile Ripley lives his life as a Roman Catholic. He goes to Mass and receives Communion every day. He goes to Confession once a month. Every morning while making the bed and boiling water for coffee, he talks to God: I offer Him my day, every act of my body and spirit, my thoughts and moods, as a prayer of thanksgiving, and for Gloria and my children and my friends and the two women I made love with after Gloria left. This morning offertory is a habit from my boyhood in a Catholic school; or then it was a habit, but as I kept it and grew older it became a ritual. Then I say the Lord's Prayer, trying hard not to recite it, and one morning it occurred to me that a prayer, whether recited or said with concentration, is always an act of faith. (458) Ripley's best friend is the local priest, Father Paul LeBoeuf, an older French-</page><page sequence="8">38 Religion &amp; Literature Canadian man. One night they talk about faith, and Father Paul says: "Belief is believing in God; faith is believing that God believes in you" (461). Luke accepts this and takes it to heart. When Jennifer comes on her summer visit, she gathers up her friends, young women like herself and at her stage of womanly bloom. This doesn't trouble Ripley much, but he is susceptible to its intimations: ...it was womanhood they were entering, the deep forest of it, and no matter how many women and men too are saying these days that there is little difference between us, the truth is that men find their way into that forest only on clearly marked trails, while women move about in it like birds. So hearingjennifer and her friends talking so quietly, yet intensely, I wanted very much to have a wife. (462) One evening, Jennifer goes to meet a few friends and drinks more beer than she should. Driving back to Ripley's house, she hits something on the road. She tells her father about the accident. He goes to the scene and finds a young man dying, not dead. However, Ripley does nothing about it: I stood. Then I kneeled again and prayed for his soul to join in peace and joy all the dead and living; and, doing so, confronted my first sin against him, not stopping for Father Paul, who could have given him the last rites, and immediately then my second one, or I saw then, my first, not calling an ambulance to meet me there, and I stood and turned into the wind, slid down the ditch and crawled out of it, and went up the hill and down it, across the road to the street of houses whose people I had left behind forever, so that I moved with stealth in the shadows to my truck. (47 1) Later, Ripley takes Jennifer's car and, to conceal the damaged front of it, crashes it into an old pine tree beside Father Paul's church. He cannot confess what he has done, but he receives Communion. The story ends: I do not feel the peace I once did: not with God, nor the earth, or anyone on it. I have begun to prefer this state, to remember with fondness the other one as a period of peace I neither earned nor deserved. Now in the mornings while I watch purple finches driving larger titmice from the feeder, I say to Him: I would do it again. For when she knocked on my door, then called me, she woke what had flowed dormant in my blood since her birth, so that what rose from the bed was not a stable owner or a Catholic or any other Luke Ripley I had lived with for a long time, but the father of a girl. And He says: I am a Father too. Yes, I say, as you are a Son Whom this morning I will receive; unless You kill me on the way to church, then I trust You will receive me. And as a Son You made Your plea. Yes, He says, but I would not lift the cup. True, and I don't want You to lift it from me either. And if one of my sons had come to me that night, I would have phoned the police and told them to meet us with an ambulance at the top of the hill.</page><page sequence="9">DENIS DONOGHUE 39 Why? Do you love them less? I tell Him no, it is not that I love them less, but that I could bear the pain of watching and knowing my sons' pain, could bear it with pride as they took the whip and nails. But You never had a daughter and, if You had, You could not have borne her passion. So, He says, you love her more than You love me. I love her more than I love truth. Then you love in weakness, He says. As You love me, I say, and I go with an apple or carrot out to the barn. (475- 76) "A Father's Story" has been much discussed. The only aspect of it I need to remark for the moment is its saturation in the vocabulary of religion, its appeal - doomed as that may be - to the idiom of God and sin and sacra- ment, confession and Eucharist, and the rival idiom of father and daughter. Whatever the moral of Luke Ripley's story may be, the moral of Dubus's telling it is that one is not compelled to capitulate to the humanist Zeitgeist. Or to settle for silence. One cultural practice does not veto another, though the rhetorics of sequentiality and progress try to persuade us that it does. Even after the accident, Luke Ripley keeps on talking to God; he may not have adequate words, but he speaks the words he has. I leave aside the question whether or not the emphasis on faith, obser- vance, grace, and sin, which we find in Dubus's story and J. E Powers's "The Presence of Grace," is now to be found only in Roman Catholic writers, as in Flannery O'Connor, who said that "the Catholic novelist believes that you destroy your freedom by sin; the modern reader believes, I think, that you gain it that way" (116). There are other narrative traditions. I think of the Yiddish story - if it is a story rather than a memoir - by Chaim Grade, called "My Quarrel with Hersh Rasseyner" which takes issues of belief and observance with appropriate seriousness. IV I have implied in my remark about the Zeitgeist that I do not regard the "spirit of the age" as having decisive or inescapable force; nor do I believe in the veridical status of sequence, except locally. So I doubt myself when I say that Hawthorne takes up where Emerson left off. They are evidently very different writers; Emerson buoyant in casting aside his Christian ministry and urging his audience at the Harvard Divinity School to take on themselves the responsibility of Christ. No wonder Alfred Kazin could say of him that "he began as a religion but ended as literature" (13). Although reluctantly and mostly with contempt, Hawthorne obsessively returned to the Puritan images that haunted his imagination. But Emerson and Hawthorne are alike in one</page><page sequence="10">40 Religion &amp; Literature respect: each of them tried to find the prose for God. I take this phrase from an episode in Harley Granville-Barker's play Waste where two politicians, Henry Trebell and Sir Charles Cantelupe, have been discussing religion. "Now shall we finish the conversation in prose," Trebell proposes. "What is the prose for God?" Sir Charles counters. "That's what we irreligious people are giving our lives to discover," Trebell says (269). 3 Emerson, irreligious to this extent, tried the experiment of replacing God by nature, and deemed the soul to be indistinguishable from the autonomous self, psychologically understood. He had behind him - if far behind him - the Puritan sermon, the essay according to Montaigne, and the periodical essay according to Addison and Steele. Hawthorne was a novelist, or at least a romancer, and he had behind him the lost epic, in keeping with Lukacs's observation that "the novel is the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God" (88). It is my contention that Hawthorne replaced God with nature and commu- nity, nature as an Emersonian substitute for God in His notionally benign aspects, community as a substitute for Him in his stringency, promulgator of the Ten Commandments. Hawthorne then reduced sin to a social offense, a transgression against the community, but a transgression that had to be committed if a self were determined to claim its independence. In "The May-Pole of Merry Mount," the festivities and mummeries of the forest "pour sunshine over New England's rugged hills" until Governor Endicott and his Puritan legion arrive to put a stop to the merriment (360). In the chapter of The Scarlet Letter called "A Flood of Sunshine," when Dimmesdale has agreed with Hester that they will take Pearl and set out for a new or resuscitated life together in Europe, Hester throws away the scarlet letter and lets her hair fall over her shoulders: "See! With this symbol, I undo it all, and make it as if it had never been!" Immediately, the sun comes out to rejoice that the lovers are together again. The narrator comments: Such was the sympathy of Nature - that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth - with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the outward world. (145-46) Human law and higher truth would be equally repellent in such a forest: inevitably, Dimmesdale goes back to the community, and the pastoral idyll is destroyed. But the only sin he recognizes is that of keeping one's actions secret: that alone is the offense against one's community. It is Ethan Brand's unpardonable sin, as well as Parson Hooper's in "The Minister's Black Veil." But the offense of secrecy is, in Hawthorne's terms, horrific: it is the only correlative he can imagine to a mortal sin.</page><page sequence="11">DENIS DONOGHUE 4 1 This is quite different from Melville's sense of sin in Pierre, who says "yes" to sin only if it is grand enough - like Satan's: And as the more immense the Virtue, so should be the more immense our approba- tion; likewise the more immense the Sin, the more infinite our pity. In some sort, Sin hath its sacredness, not less than holiness. And great Sin calls forth more magnanimity than small Virtue. What man, who is a man, does not feel livelier and more generous emotions toward the great god of Sin - Satan, - than toward yonder haberdasher, who only is a sinner in the small and entirely honorable way of trade? (1 77-78) But Hester's sin is commonplace, it calls forth from Hawthorne nothing like Blake's - or Melville's - thrilled assent to Satan's. Henry James's explanation of Hawthorne's religious sense - or the expla- nation he arrived at after much talk of sin and gloom - is that Hawthorne took images lightly in the end by taking them aesthetically. His relation to his Puritan inheritance "was only, as one may say, intellectual; it was not moral and theological" (363). He was not haunted by it, having found him- self capable of being light and airy despite its oppression. James seems to mean that even when Hawthorne disposes his images and themes such that a comprehensive imagining of them would entail entering metaphysical or moral darkness, he resorted in the end to an aesthetic sense of them and held off from their importunity. James says of "Young Goodman Brown" that "it evidently means nothing as regards Hawthorne's own state of mind, his conviction of human depravity and his consequent melancholy; for the simple reason that if it meant anything, it would mean too much" (396). In "Hawthorne and his Mosses," Melville maintained that "in spite of all the Indian-summer sunlight on the hither side of Hawthorne's soul, the other side - like the dark half of the physical sphere - is shrouded in a blackness, ten times black." Whether Hawthorne "has simply availed himself of this mystical blackness as a means to the wondrous effects he makes it to pro- duce in his lights and shades; or whether there really lurks in him, perhaps unknown to himself, a touch of Puritanic gloom," Melville said, " - this, I cannot altogether tell" (540). Melville was determined a few months before the publication of Moby-Dick to make Hawthorne seem blood-brother to himself, both writers with an immense power of blackness. But the case is still disputed. Lionel Trilling has given us reasons for thinking it a limitation in Hawthorne's genius that he did not take the risk of having his fictions mean too much, if they were to mean at all. Trilling's comparison of Hawthorne with Kafka carries this critical judgment. He says of them: They stood in equivalent relations to religion: unbelievers both, their imaginations were captivated by the faiths to which they were connected by family tradition, and from these unavowed faiths they derived the license for the mythic genre which</page><page sequence="12">42 Religion &amp; Literature constitutes so much of their appeal, for the representation of agencies of human destiny which are not of the actual world. (197-98) But finally, as Trilling says in the spirit of James's monograph: "Hawthorne always consented to the power of his imagination being controlled by the power of the world" (204). This is persuasive, but there is, I think, a further explanation. Hawthorne's replacement of the hidden God by the dual values of nature and community was so tactically reductive that neither of those values could compel the full stretch of his imagination. Nature meant mostly the forest, the place of pastoral freedom and guiltlessness, though it could have entailed more dangerous forces if "Young Goodman Brown" had been imagined as fully as it might have been. It could have entailed redemptive forces, too, as Ike's imagining of the wilderness does in Faulkner's "Delta Autumn," a conception of nature that "amounts to the sacramental," as Cleanth Brooks says (Brooks 262; quoted in Weatherby 93). Community to Hawthorne meant mostly law and its observances. Only in "My Cousin Major Molyneux" and "Young Goodman Brown" - and then ambiguously - did he imagine that a community could easily turn into an orgiastic crowd, a mob, as Elias Canetti shows in Crowds and Power. Before Canetti, Durkheim remarked on the force of enthusiasm to which a society is susceptible: The aptitude of society for setting itself up as a god or for creating gods was never more apparent than during the first years of the French Revolution. At that time, in fact, under the influence of the general enthusiasm, things purely laical by nature were transformed by public opinion into sacred things: these were the Fatherland, Liberty, Reason. (Durkheim 244-45; Derrida 22) Such a transformation, as Roberto Calasso explains in Literature and the Gods, became most appalling when it sounded most natural: it expressed itself in tautology, self-advertising. What was once the preserve of religion became the power of society, taken for granted. "Being anti-social would become the equivalent of sinning against the Holy Ghost" (173). In a more recent book, /f, Calasso refines this perception in terms of social absorption: Certainly it's not the case, as some continue to maintain, that the religious or the sacred or the divine has been shattered, dissolved, obviated, by some outside agent, by the light of the Enlightenment. That would have resulted in a world made of secular funerals, in all their awful bleakness. What happened instead is that such things as the religious or the sacred or the divine, by an obscure process of osmosis, were absorbed and hidden in something alien, which no longer has need of such names because it is self-sufficient and is content to be described as society: All the rest is, at best, its object of study, its guinea pig - even all of nature. (22)</page><page sequence="13">DENIS DONOGHUE 43 Hawthorne's tactical reduction of God to nature and community was not a device that engaged Melville's interest: his imagination refused to be satisfied with available terms. If he had attempted any such reduction, he would have treated the attempt with disgust. In Moby-Dick, he hands over the devices of commonsense to Ishmael, thereby indicating how genially mundane he judges them to be. Sometimes he lets Ishmael play games with nouns and adjectives, but always on the understanding - I mean the reader's understanding - that the deep truth of things is beyond or beneath IshmaePs syntax. Beneath, as in the truth of the primitive: beyond, as in that of the sublime. Sometimes, Melville has Ishmael report the ordinary truths, and the report is convincing so far as it goes. The short chapter 79, "The Prairie," has this gorgeous piece of nonsense, but it is not entirely nonsense: And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it. (347) This is an example of Melville's middle style, discursive and equable. It is the style of intelligent conversation. It is capable of making a point worth making, that "in the now egotistical sky" and "in the now unhaunted hill" are parallel phrases because they are companionable perceptions. The hill is unhaunted because the gods have been dispelled, and the new god is the ego, not Emerson's invention but his reiterated motto. Melville can write in this style because he can write in every style, but his handing over of this particular style to Ishmael shows that he doesn't take its deliverances with much gravity. They are true enough, but not the truth. The character who transcends the limitations of the middle style most comprehensively while remaining committed to its legal force is Captain Vere in "Billy Budd," who is not only loving, but love itself. In Moby-Dick the style Melville cares about is Ahab's, and that is the style of blasphemy for the most part, or any of the other high or sublime utterances including Father Mapple's. Melville appro- priated other versions of the sublime - the King James Bible, Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Burton, and Milton among them - not to participate in the shared copia of the English language but to overwhelm it, to make it submit to his violence. Moby-Dick is not a book about Ahab, Ishmael, Que- equeg, Father Mapple, and other people; it is centrally about Ahab and the White Whale, though there are readers who want to read it otherwise. The</page><page sequence="14">44 Religion &amp; Literature whale is not a figure of evil in the world, but rather a figure of the world itself, of Being, which Ahab hates as much as he hates the God of Calvin he holds accountable for it. They make the double object of his blasphemy, the only mode in which Melville's imagination is religious. David Reynolds has noted that Calvinism in American fiction in the late Eighteenth- and early Nineteenth-Centuries was gradually replaced by the doctrine of good works, but it had a remarkable growth again in the years up to 1840 (100). Melville may have had pressing reason to be appalled by it during those years, though by the 1850s the question of one's religious denomination, if religious fiction is evidence, became "inconsequential for the Protestant novelist" (121). Many years ago, Lawrance Thompson argued in Melville's Quarrel with God that Melville's pervasive attitude to Christian dogma and the Christian concept of God was one of "taunting ridicule," most clearly seen in The Confidence-Man and Pierre (239). I find that hard to refute. V But there are other possibilities of experience between irreligion and devo- tion. Allen Tate has argued, in an essay on Emily Dickinson that was taken up and developed by R. P. Blackmur, that Dickinson came at a time which may have been arduous for her soul but was enabling to her poems, a time when the theocracy of New England had nearly collapsed but was still felt as sufficiently in force to be interrogated and challenged, mocked as often as respected. While it lasted, the theocracy had "an immense, incalculable value for literature: it dramatized the human soul." It gave meaning - or least the possibility of meaning - to life: "the life of pious and impious, of learned and vulgar alike." Puritanism "could not be to Dickinson what it had been to the generation of Cotton Mather - a body of absolute truths; it was an unconcious discipline timed to the pulse of her life" (294). Blackmur veers from Tate at this point. He does not believe that Puritanism was for Dickinson an uncompromising discipline or that the timing was right for her pulse: Faith was sophisticated, freed, and terrified - but still lived; imagination had suddenly to do all the work of embodying faith formerly done by habit, and to embody it with the old machinery so far as it could be used. {Essays 1 78) In such conditions, faith - in the hands of the individual and while the institutions of faith are crumbling - "becomes an imaginative experiment of which all the elements are open to new and even blasphemeous combina- tions, and which is subject to the addition of new insights." Puritanism was no longer much good as doctrine or received wisdom, but it was good enough to be teased and provoked. The theocracy was still there as machinery, though</page><page sequence="15">DENIS DONOGHUE 45 feeble for more personal purposes. As a result, Dickinson could have only an experimental relation to it; but that was what she needed, her sensibility being what it was. She came at the most fortunate moment for the poetry she had it in her to write: "the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision," as Blackmur calls it (195). It had to be eccentric and probably willful because it did not issue from a living tradition of faith and observance. It had to be sophisticated because it could not be simple, sensuous, and passionate all at once. That explains why her poems, like the Bible, can be quoted in favor of nearly every cause, for she is never doctrinal. Blackmur claims that "the great advantage for a poet to come at a time of disintegrating culture is [that] the actuality of what we are and what we believe is suddenly seen to be nearly meaningless as habit, and must, to be adequately known, be translated to the terms and modes of imagination" (179). Emerson, according to this emphasis in Tate and Blackmur, hardly knew what he was doing, but he ended up removing any tragic possibilities from the culture he addressed. The effect of Emerson's doctrine of individualism, according to Tate, is that "there is no drama in human character because there is no tragic fault" (285). There is no sin, no action for which anyone would think of seeking forgiveness. One of the most shocking passages in Emerson's "Experience" is this flourish of exoneration: We believe in ourselves, as we do not believe in others. We permit all things to ourselves, and that which we call sin in others is experiment for us... Saints are sad, because they behold sin (even when they speculate), from the point of view of the conscience, and not of the intellect; a confusion of thought. Sin, seen from the thought, is a diminution or less; seen from the conscience or will, it is pravity or bad. The intellect names it shade, absence of light, and no essence. The conscience must feel it as essence, essential evil. This it is not; it has an objective existence, but no subjective. (360-61) I wonder what Emmanuel Levinas - who regarded as the primary act the acknowledgment of another person, and the acknowledgment of one's self as secondary and derivative - would think of that. Tate thought that Hawthorne "kept pure, in the primitive terms, the pri- mative vision; he brings the puritan tragedy to its climax." Man, "measured by a great idea outside himself, is found wanting" (284). I doubt this, and think that Blackmur had the better case when he asserted: Some say Hawthorne was a great student of evil; I think rather that he studied how to avoid and ignore it by interposing the frames of his tales between evil and the experience of it. (Outsider 272) Perhaps this is to say that Hawthorne saw evil as omnivorous but diffuse,</page><page sequence="16">46 Religion &amp; Literature and that his imagination was not willing to identify evil with its local mani- festations. There had to be more evil at large than he could specify. But if he rejected the world, he did not do it blithely. Tate says: Mastery of the world by rejecting the world was the doctrine, even if it was not always the practice, of Jonathan Edwards and Cotton Mather. It is the meaning of fate in Hawthorne: his people are fated to withdraw from the world and to be destroyed. And it is one of the great themes of Henry James. (287) But the theme was much diminished by the time James took it up: Between Hawthorne and James lies an epoch. The temptation to sin, in Hawthorne, is, in James, transformed into the temptation not to do the "decent thing." A whole world-scheme, a complete cosmic background, has shrunk to the dimensions of the individual conscience. (287) Tate does not say what this reduction of scale entails. Presumably he means what Dickinson meant: "The abdication of belief / Makes the behavior small" (Poem 1581 in Franklin's edition). But in James there is more to it - more left to it - than the temptation not to do the "right thing." The problem for James was to imply a context of grave reference within which his little fable would work out its life. In a different culture and a different social class, such a context would be reli- gious, but James could not give himself to that resource. His sense of religion was inert. Trilling remarks in "Art and Fortune" that what theologians call "faith" is what James, in the Preface to The American, calls "romance": The real represents to my perception the things we cannot possibly not know, sooner or later, in one way or another; it being but one of the accidents of our hampered state, and one of the incidents of their quantity and number, that particular instances have not yet come our way. The romantic stands, on the other hand, for the things that, with all the facilities in the world, all the wealth and all the courage and all the wit and all the adventure, we never can directly know; the things that can reach us only through the beautiful circuit and subterfuge of our thought and desire. (262) Sometimes the subterfuge gives itself away. Though there is much talk of wings and doves in The Wings of the Dove, none of the characters, including Milly, could be expected to recall the Psalm from which James culled his title, which is Psalm 55: 'Tearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said: Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then I would fly away, and be at rest." And Psalm 68: "Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold." James is remembering for his characters, trying to give them something of his own affluence of sensitiv- ity. His religious sense being lethargic, he had to find other ways of making</page><page sequence="17">DENIS DONOGHUE 47 stories seem weighted, even if the weight was entirely a matter of social acquisition and taste. The story of The Wings of the Dove is so odious that only the succession of high-toned reflections and conversations deflects us from seeing how odious it is. References to the Bible are consistent with a cultural period in which it was becoming common to read the Bible as literature, the first of the Great Books, to be read without incurring the obligation of believing a word of it. In Henry Adams, the conclusion to every question of religion is fore- gone. He had no faith, only the need of it because only a great faith would have seized his energy and given it form. He wrote the Education to show cause - pathetic, indeed - why none of the interests he took up was worth his sustained attention. His account of religion in Boston in the years from 1848 to 1852 is predictably and appropriately dismissive. Even in Mont- Saint-Michel and Chartres, where he expended every nuance of appreciation and tenderness for the Virgin, he could not let her go until he had presented her "looking down from a deserted heaven, into an empty church, on a dead faith" (197). Nothing appeased his desire but failure. In his novel of religion, Esther, Adams makes his heroine Esther Dudley an agnostic. She could be drawn, in frail theory, to the minister Rev. Stephen Hazard, who loves her. But in the end she is more taken with the Niagara Falls than with anything Stephen Hazard finds to say to her. The penury of her imagina- tion is made clear when she says to Stephen: "Is it not enough to know myself?... Some people are made with faith. I am made without it" (159). A bolder man than Stephen would have answered: "No, it is not enough to know yourself, especially if you don't know that your talk of 'some people' who are made with faith and T without it is specious. Have you no part in your own making?" A subterfuge similar to James's in its enhancing reach is resorted to in The Great Gatsby when Nick meditates on Gatsby: The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God - a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that - and he must be about His Father's Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. (104) Nick is endowing Gatsby with mythic justification, and for that purpose he needs to give him a second self independent of his first. The allusion is impudent. There is no proper analogy between the youngjesus teaching his peers in the temple and Jay Gatsby inventing himself to make money and achieve a style. The analogy, specious as it is, is Nick's way of accepting that Gatsby is at worst a minor god, even if the cause he serves is meretricious. Nick has become one of those millions of Protestant Americans who, as</page><page sequence="18">48 Religion &amp; Literature Northrop Frye observed, "have drifted, and are continuing to drift, away from their earlier religious moorings, not always through indifference, but very often because they feel that a secular life is the most mature, civilized, and serious form of the kind of Christian liberty offered them by Protes- tantism" (255-56). William James's Varieties of Religious Experience and Robert Bellah's Habits of the Heart might be quoted to make Frye's point. I think Frye means middle-class American Protestants. Working-class Protestants resort to God and the Bible at least in moments of crisis, as Mrs. Griffith does in An American Tragedy when her son Clyde is found guilty and awaits execution: Clyde must pray for her and for himself. Read Isaiah. Read the psalms - the 23rd and the 51st and the 91st daily. Also Habakuk. "Are there walls against the Hand of the Lord?" (356) These are not the prayers of Northrop Frye's American Protestants. For the same reason, Henry Adams thought that all Americans were naturally Conservative Christian Anarchists. To Adams, as Blackmur explained, "what kept American society together and plastic was the fact that deep in its unconcious feeling for the human ideal it had never committed itself to any single version of the good as supreme" [Adams 202). One little god is as good as another. The reason for this may be that the American religion is not what it thinks it is. Harold Bloom has put forward the claim arguing that the American religion is a bewildered mixture of Christianity and Gnosticism, Christi- anity other than it knows itself, Gnosticism as it doesn't know itself at all. The religious experience is apart from clergy or church. "No American pragmatically feels free if she is not alone," Bloom says, "and no American ultimately concedes that she is part of nature" (15). That seems to make her post-Emerson and post-Stevens, a point insisted on later when Bloom says that "the freedom assured by the American religion is not what Protestants once called Christian Liberty, but is a solitude in which the inner loneliness is at home in an outer loneliness." That seems to make it at once post-Ste- vens and post-Frost, a redaction of Stevens's "Snow Man" and Frost's "An Old Man's Winter Night." Much later in The American Religion, Bloom asks a question that seems odd until we reflect that any American religion he posits must submit to poetic and aesthetic criteria. The question he asks is: Why is it that we have produced so few masterpieces of overtly religious literature - "we" meaning Americans. "Devotional poetry or narrative or drama, of any aesthetic eminence, or of any profound spirituality, hardly exists among us" (257). Bloom doesn't stay for an answer. He merely suggests more Emerson. "The issue is not self-worship; it is acquaintance with a God</page><page sequence="19">DENIS DONOGHUE 49 within the self" (259). American ecstasy, Bloom says, is solitary, "even when it requires the presence of others as audience for the self's glory" (264). I thought we already had that with "Self Reliance" and "Song of Myself." It appears that there is no fiction, no poetry, commensurate with Bloom's sense of the American religion: only "a full-scale return to the wars of religion" is foreseen. After that impasse on Bloom's part, it is time to return to Dubus's "A Father's Story." In that conversation with God at the end, how does Luke Ripley know that he is not merely talking to himself? He has shown none of the misgiving that would hobble the discourse of one who knew that there is no special language for supernatural experience. He has not been seeking the prose for God or brooding on the differences between that prose and some sublime poetry. He has committed himself to the middle style. Yet here he is, after all that has happened, talking to God: it is a difficult conversation, but a conversation nonetheless. What enables it, and what protects him from the loneliness on which Bloom's putative citizen insists, is his membership of the Church, the sacraments, the rituals, the Mass, Confession, and Communion. It is not enough that these make a community utterly free from the vigilant and punitive mission that held the community together in The Scarlet Letter. The sacraments give him access to - participa- tion in - the modes of sacrifice and meaning which he enters by himself but not entirely by himself: there are the others. He is not looking for "a God within the self." New York University NOTES 1 . Cf.
