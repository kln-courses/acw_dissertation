Denver Public Library, Conservation Collection io West 14th Ave. Parkway Denver, CO 80204 American Motors Conservation Awards 1943-1981 30 boxes The American Motors Conservation Awards were begun in 1953, with the title of The Nash Conservation Awards Program. Mr. Ed Zern, a nationally recognized sportsman, writer, and columnist for Field and Stream was the architect of the program from its inception. The stated purpose of the program was "as recognition of the fact that our renewable natural resources are a God-given heritage, to be used wisely and defended against waste and reckless exploitation, and that the professional and non-professional conservationist each perform an important and often unappreciated role in our industrial society." Nominations were accepted from anyone, but an important factor in the selection of winners was a commitment to conservation of natural resources and a lack of recognition in the conservation community. Often a nominee was disqualified due to too much exposure. Those who did win the award were originally presented a plaque, a citation, and $500 for the professional winners. American Motors remained as sponsor of the awards until 1980. Following American Motors' tenure, Gulf Oil (1981-1985) and Chevron (1985-2002) have continued to present the conservation awards. Times Mirror Magazines partnered with Chevron to present the awards from 1994-1996. Since the original awards presented in 1954, approximately i,ooo conservation professionals, volunteers, and non-profit organizations have been recognized by the Conservation Awards The collection contains items from the years 1943-1981.

His efforts to promote control of erosion led to the establishment of the Soil Conservation Service and thousands of soil conservation districts across the United States. He described his approach to promoting soil conservation as "science, farmer participation, publicity, and Congressional relations." Bennett's relentless touring</page><page sequence="47">BIBLIOSCOPE I 613 and speaking on behalf of soil conservation were just one part of his approach to selling soil conservation, but one that he considered important. A portion of the numerous speeches and papers written by Bennett make up the bulk of this collection. Bennett was born on his parents' farm near Wadesboro, North Carolina, in i881. He spent his youth on the family farm, which was adversely affected by soil erosion. The rest of his life Bennett remembered this seasonal washing away of the best land owned by his family. In 1897, he entered the University of North Carolina, but was forced to take a two-year break from his studies due to financial problems. He graduated with his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1903. After college, he went to work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture doing soil surveys across the South. He worked in various positions throughout the Department of Agriculture, before becoming Supervisor of Soil Surveys in 1909. A major promotion came in 1929, when he was put in charge of soil erosion and moisture conservation for the Bureau of Chemistry of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Through his knowledge and persistence in promoting soil conservation, he became chief of the Soil Erosion Service, and, following a reorganization of the department, Chief of the Soil Conservation Service. Throughout this time in his life, His ideas on soil conservation became well known throughout the world. Bennett wrote numerous works on soil conservation. His 1939 book, Soil Conservation, is regarded as the standard text on the subject. He wrote additional volumes, including The Soils of Cuba, The Soils and Agriculture of the Southern States, and Elements of Soil Conservation. One of the main accomplishments from Bennett's time in Washington D.C. was the passage of Public Law 46, in 1935. Considered the first soil conservation act in the world, its passage had been promoted persistently by Bennett. The Hugh Hammond Bennett collection contains papers from 1921 to 1959. Most of the items in the collection are articles and speeches written by Bennett for his many appearances around the United States. Published articles, publications about soil conservation issues, and radio addresses by Bennett are also included.

Joshua Fry Bullitt, Jr., was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 242, 1856. In 1887, with other capitalists from the Bluegrass region, he moved to Big Stone Gap, where he set up practice with a fellow Kentuckian, Henry Clay McDowell, and dabbled in coal and timber lands. In i888 they formed the South Appalachian Land Company. Around 1905 Bullitt formed a new partnership with John W. Chalkley. They found ready clients among the many new coal companies. Bullitt became one of a handful of experts on the arcane subject of Appalachian land titles. In 1890, when the coal boom was in full swing, he organized the Police Guard of Big Stone Gap. The Guard was formed to suppress the more raucous behavior of the mountaineers who periodically poured into town looking for excitement. His fellow policeman, John Fox, Jr., wrote Bullitt into his The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, where he appears as the "Captain of the Guard." Bullitt began working for the Virginia Coal &amp; Iron Company around 1891, and they eventually became his biggest client. The records document Bullitt's work in corporate and land law: securing charters and deeds, preparing title abstracts, and handling litigation over title conflicts. Among the companies covered are the Virginia, Tennessee &amp; Carolina Steel &amp; Iron Company, the Interstate Coal &amp; iron Company, and the Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Company. Other large land companies include the Interstate Investment Company, the Mineral Development Company, and the Clinch Valley Coal &amp; Iron Company.

University of Connecticut Library 405 Babbidge Road, Unit i2o5 Storrs, CT o6269-1205 Brasher, Rex n.d. 549 linear feet Rex Brasher was born in 1869 in Brooklyn, NewYork. Rex became passionate about birds at an early age, due to the influence of his father, an avid naturalist and bird taxidermist. In his youth he had heard many times how his father had gone to John James Audubon to discuss birds, only to be snubbed. In 1878, at the age of eight, Brasher determined to paint all the birds of North America from life-and better than Audubon. He started painting birds seriously around age 16, but none of his early paintings has survived. His determination to study birds in their natural surroundings took Brasher to all corners of North America. He financed his first trip, down the east coast from Maine to Florida, by working as a photoengraver. Most of his other trips were financed by betting on horse races. One of his most successful bets netted $1o,ooo and financed an extensive trip to the Midwest. At one point he took a job on a fishing boat sailing out of Boston and Portland. He was then able to earn a living while studying and sketching sea birds. During his years of artistic work he often found it necessary to make financial ends meet by doing farm work, work with the town road crew, carpentry and housebuilding. On his trips to the West, Midwest and Gulf Coast, Brasher traveled by train and on foot. Sometimes he walked the countryside for months at a time, stopping along the way to mail home his sketches and notes. Between trips he painted in an apartment in New York. In 1907, while studying the bird skin collection of the American Museum of Natural History, Brasher met the famous bird painter, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, who became his good friend and a major influence on his art. In 1911, Rex purchased a small farmhouse on 15o-acres near Kent, Connecticut. He called his homestead Chickadee Valley. It was there in 1924, after forty-seven years of work, that he finished his task. His paintings included 1,0oo species and sub-species of birds listed on the American Ornithologists Union (AOU) Checklist of North American Birds. The numbers on many of the paintings are the AOU numbers assigned to the birds. Brasher's paintings included more than twice as many birds as Audubon's, who painted 489.</page><page sequence="50">616 I ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 1 0 (JULY 2005) In 1938 the paintings were sent to Washington, D. C. to be exhibited as Birds and Trees of NorthAmericainthe Explorers Hall of the National Geographic Society. Brasher wanted to see his paintings published but discovered that it would be far too expensive to print all 874 of his paintings in color. He self-published ioo sets of 12 volumes of Birds and Trees of North America, including almost go,ooo hand- colored reproductions. Rex Brasher worked until two years before his death, when his sight failed him. He died in 1960, in Gaylordsville, Connecticut, at the age of 91.

A graduate of Vassar (A.B. 1916) and Radcliffe (M.A. 1917), Knowlton began climbing in the White Mountains at age seven. The endeavor that proved central to her life and workwas her climb of Nanga Parbat in Pakistan (Kashmir) with the other eight members of the German American Himalayan Expedition in 1932. Described by the Portland Press Herald as "a painter who will 'mother' the expedition," Knowlton later countered, "I lived for over a month in a tent in the snow high upon the mountain-at over 20,000 feet." Knowlton considered herself more freelance writer than journalist, but her best writing is informed by a journalistic urge for clarity. She never married, but among her correspondents are a goddaughter-Caroline Herron, and a nephew by her brother Marcus P. Knowlton, also Marcus. Elizabeth Knowlton continued to hike the foothills when too old to climb. She died in Scituate, Massachusetts, aged 93. Knowlton's two known published books are her story of the GAHE, The Naked Mountain, and avolume of poems, Griefis a LonelyJourney(NewYork: Comet Press Books, 1952).
