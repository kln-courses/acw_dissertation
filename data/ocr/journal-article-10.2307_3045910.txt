<plain_text><page sequence="1">Who's Who in Michelangelo's Creation ofAdam: A Chronology of the Picture's Reluctant Self-Revelation Leo Steinberg 1547-53 Some tots--alcuni putti-is all Vasari saw, or remembered seeing, under God's other arm in the Sistine Creation ofAdam; an inadequate observation to which Condivi had nothing to add. Accordingly, God's chosen intimates in the fresco (foldout following p. 566) remained for the next 320 years unlooked-for and nondescript-until rescued from anonym- ity through the industry of a retired Alsatian policeman, whom the Paris photographer Adolphe Braun had trained to take pictures. 1870 After two years of camera work atop a 60-foot scaffold by the aforesaid gendarme (his name seems to be lost), the Paris firm Adolphe Braun et Cie. published a set of 120 large photographic details of the Ceiling, among them The Cre- ation ofAdam: a fine albumen print, 73cm wide, mounted on cardboard backing (Fig. 1).' Needless to say, this earliest photograph of the fresco surpassed in accuracy the hand- drawn copies that still represent the Creation in surveys and monographs even to the late 1880s. Yet, by our lights, the Braun people did not play fair: to enhance the clarity of Michelangelo's composition they had treated the negative, eliminating superfluous matter. Of the twelve who surround God in the fresco's right half, four or five were suppressed, including the cherubs at upper right, so that Vasari's "alcuni putti"-the two under God's arm-lifted off against neutral ground. The effect of their startled prominence on Michelan- gelo criticism was catastrophic. 1871 There is a lengthy review of the Braun photographs in The Portfolio, written by the Scottish artist-poet William Bell Scott. Scott acknowledges the pains of viewing the frescoes in situ, but deplores the neglect of the Sistine Chapel ("nearly always silent and solitary") since the latter seventeenth century. He proceeds: The appearance, therefore, of the large series of photo- graphs by Adolphe Braun, the patentee on the Continent of our English permanent process, has been a surprise to many. So much so, that the world seems to understand for the first time what a royal treasure-house this Vatican Chapel is. [Michelangelo] has . . . been called abstract and ideal, but these terms are dangerous and inexact, because of the naturalness and (above all) the individualzty of all he did. This has hitherto been little recognised even by those who examined the frescoes closely, but these photographs by Braun show the variety of his characterisation, as no engravings have ever done .... In the Creation of Adam, the Almighty is surrounded by the future in the shape of mighty children, supporting Him who needs no support, and an antitypal [szc] Eve looks round from under His arm, her great eyes fixed on the newly-created man!2 The terminal exclamation mark is in order. Until this accented moment, the Creation fresco had seemed to respect unity of time, place, and action: God, to the wonderment of angelic witness, giving his masterwork its finishing touch. Now, without waiting its turn, the specter of a preemptive Eve threatened to interfere, and this must be resisted. The notion of a premature woman in God's embrace was, Scott reported in 1875, "entirely questioned by my friends." "A well-known art critic," with whom he had been examining the original two years before, "remained impervious to the idea even when constrained to admit that the figure was feminine." And Scott's posthumous Autobiographzcal Notes records that the eminent Charles Heath Wilson, author of a substantial Michelangelo monograph published in 1876, "laughed at my elucidation of the female appearing in the The present essay is excerpted from a book on the Creatzon fresco to be published by the Menil Foundation, Inc., in association with George Braziller. I take this opportunity, as I would any fitting occasion, to sing the praise of both parties, and to thank the Menil Foundation for its many courtesies, past, present, and promised, including the underwrit- ing of the cost of the (post-cleaning) color foldout and plate.

Braun's lead was quickly followed by Alinari, whose photographic campaign in the Sistine Chapel, initiated in 1876, produced 159 plates; by Alessandro Vasari in 1880; by Giacomo Brogi in 1888; and by Domenico Anderson in 1898 (Moltedo, nos. 57, 60, 56, and 61, respectively). But as late as 1896, when Estelle M. Hurll reissued Anna Jameson's Memozrs of Early Italian Painters (1859), she added to Jameson's account of the Sistine frescoes: "The Arundel Society has published a chromo-lithograph of the Sistine ceiling, and Braun has issued a series of one hundred and twenty photographs of the panels" (Boston, 1896, v, 159). 2W.

He went farther, showing his want of sense by pronouncing the discovery of no consequence!"3 Why Scott's untimely Eve (Fig. 2) aroused such resistance is an interesting question which I hope to address in a book on the Creation fresco now in progress. No less intriguing is the abundance of counter-proposals that soon overwhelmed Scott's discovery and reduced it to merely one among divers hypotheses: might not the creature under God's arm be the Blessed Virgin? or the personified human soul? or the Divina Sapientia spoken of in Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus? or the Holy Ghost in the form of the Cabala's Shekhinah ? or again, according to the opinion of Carl Justi (1900), a study in cherubic curiosity? "Perhaps," wrote Justi, "the figure is merely the winsomest personification of the angelic craving for knowledge. Girls as a rule are not only more inquisitive but also more intelligent than boys. This is why [Michelange- lo] chose this small angel-woman to lead the pack. She is all eye, and the eye is all comprehension."4 It was a critical moment in Michelangelo scholarship. With options proliferating, all hope of certainty seemed imper- iled. Therefore, to stay the influx of more good ideas, the mighty Ernst Steinmann (1905) decreed: The beautiful creature of a feminine rather than mascu- line type, who presses forward so pertly from under Jehovah's left arm and looks so intently at Adam, is neither Eve nor the "world-fashioning Sophia of the Book of Wisdom," nor the "personified human soul," but an angel of masculine build like all the rest.5 3W.

Luitpold Dussler called the young thing a "spiritello," a sprite.6 Nor could the late Frederick Hartt find "any evi- dence that a female figure is designated."'7 Even after the cleaning campaign of the 1980s, Hartt insisted on masculin- ity. In the text he wrote for The Sistine Chapel-I refer to the elephantine one-grand, two-tome, twenty-seven-pound obsta- cle published by Nippon Television, wherein Gianluigi Co- lalucci, chief of the restoration team, checks off the creature under God's arm as "the young woman whose presence here continues to be explained in a variety of ways"-Hartt delivered his last word on the subject: Often and incomprehensibly characterized as female, and a depiction of the yet-to-be incarnate soul of Eve, or even that of the Virgin Mary-contrary to Catholic theology, which maintains that the soul is created at the moment of conception. The chest line contains no hint of Michelange- lo's characteristic rendering of female breasts, and is perfectly consistent with that of the nude youths. The curly locks of the hair, moreover, are shorter than those of many of the nudes.8 If ever there was a lost cause, it's the bid to un- or transsex the croucher by arguing from the low profile of that "chest line." Michelangelo gave the figure the shy mamillae of a pubescent girl, whose hair is center-parted and piled on top (in Renaissance art a uniquely feminine style), and whose pose-not to be slighted-evokes the familiar antique Crouch- zng Venus (Figs. 2, 3). Since the surviving versions of this Venus type usually come without arms, Michelangelo (like Raphael in his design for Marcantonio's engraving, B. 313) invented a gesture for her: reaching for daddy's arm. The gesture spells innocent trust-no need to interpret; unless we ponder, as Michelan- gelo may have done, what Eve at this brink would be doing. We are then led to wonder: in the first shock of her vision, is she seeking the fatherly arm for protection, or wanting to shake it off? Perhaps the ambivalence of the gesture implies woman's relation to the father as she assumes her relation to man. I say perhaps, and would argue only that the observed ambiguity, if correctly observed, makes good sense. But more telling than posture, gesture, bust measure- ments, or coiffure are the croucher's centrality and spatial effectiveness. Her influence radiates to all cardinal points: upward as she grasps the paternal yoke that weighs on her shoulder; sideward to fix upon Adam; rightward, engaging the child; and, as we shall see, downward by way of a fatal loincloth. Daughter, bride-designate, mother, she buds here as all woman-while posture and charm convey the venereal attributes of beauty, candor, fecundity. As for the challenges to her identity, those especially that would equate her with Mary, they disregard too much of the picture and spread needless confusion. Notwithstanding the claims of several recent textbooks, the refutation is simple and final: no female crouched like an Aphrodite and fasci- nated by Adam may be the Blessed Virgin. And if that's not persuasive enough, then summon Hans Andersen's artless child to remind us that she has nothing on. She cannot but be Adam's mate, as William Bell Scott in 1871 (and Walter Pater) had eyes to see.9 1875-1905 At the fourth centenary of Michelangelo's birth, the Leipzig Zeitschrift far Bildende Kunst published an astonishing four- page article on the Creation ofAdam fresco.'1 The author was Jean-Paul Richter, better known for his subsequent corpus of the literary works of Leonardo da Vinci. In his Michelangelo paper, Richter rediscovered Eve in the embraced croucher and, looking beyond, identified the child at her knee, the boy whose shoulder receives God's left index finger and thumb- declaring him to be none other than Christ. For the first so vorwitzig unter dem linken Arm Jehovahs hervordrangt und so gespannt auf Adam blickt, ist weder Eva noch die 'weltbildende Sophia des Buches der Weisheit,' noch 'die Personifikation der Menschenseele,' sondern ein Engel von mdinnlicher Bildung wie alle iibrigen." Stein- mann's note 1, same page, lays out the evidence: "Im Fresko Michelan- gelos kann man fibrigens mfihelos die mannliche Brust des Engels erkennen. .." 6 L.

See Vol. II, 94, for the Colalucci passage; for the Hartt quotation, 374, n. 24. Hartt's doctrinal objection to the Eve identification as "contrary to Catholic theology" applies only where the figure is identified with Eve's unborn soul, as in H. Hibbard, Michelangelo, New York, 1974, 137, quoted in n. 21, below. Cf. A. Stokes, Mzchelangelo: A Study zn the Nature of Art (1955): ".. . God the Father ... controls about him an uterine mantle filled with attendants who clamber close, souls yet to be born. ." (reprinted in The Crztzcal Wrztzngs ofAdrian Stokes, London, 1978, III, 52). But most scholars avoid that particular error. Thus H. Hettner, (Italzenzsche Studzen, Braunschweig, 1879, 257), drawing on "Platonist theology" to reject Richter's identification of the figure as proper Eve, called the figure the "personification of the human soul." Scott himself wrote "antetype" and Eve's "eidolon," and again, "the representation of Eve before she had existed, an antetypal Eve in the mind of the Everlasting Father, who saw effects in their causes" ("Correspondence," as in n. 3, 358). For others, the figure represents a future tense, God's "further purpose," "the idea of Eve," "the embodiment of the idea of Eve," "the type of woman," or else "Eve, the type of Ecclesia, still uncreated yet present, peer[ing] forth from the great fold of God's mantle" (W. Seiferth, Synagogue and Church zn the Mzddle Ages, New York, 1970, 140)-all of which may be arguable, but not on dogmatic grounds. 9 Pater's essay "The Poetry of Michelangelo" (1871; included in Pater's The Renazssance, 1873), speaks in passing of "the image of the Almighty, as he comes with the forms of things to be, woman and her progeny, in the fold of his garment!"-an observation which William Bell Scott, wanting full credit for coming in first, belittled as follows: "I am happy to find my friend Mr. Pater adopted the idea in his excellent Studzes zn the Hzstory of the Renazssance. He may have conceived it for himself by study of Braun's photograph." But Scott's foreboding about being written out of the record was justified. In scholarly Michelangelo literature, the discovery of Eve in the fresco is now routinely ascribed to his epigones. P. Barocchi (in Gzorgzo Vasarz: La vita di Mzchelangelo, Milan and Naples, 1962, II, 525) gives the credit to Richter because she knows only Scott's 1875 article, not the original review of 1871; C. de Tolnay (The Szstzne Cezlzng, Princeton, 1945, 136) assigns the discovery unequivocally to Richter; and in the Steinmann-Wittkower Mzchelangelo Biblzographze (Leipzig, 1927), poor Scott gets no separate entry. His painting, poetry, or polemics may not offer much to admire, but let credit sit where it's due. 10 J. P.

But Richter's Christological hunch came a full generation too soon-only one believer appears in the record. An Englishman about whom one would like to know more, Alfred Higgins, understood at once that the picture had been irreversibly altered. Instead of freezing an instant, the composition now traced a continuum, and Higgins approved: "Thus are finely indicated at the very moment of Adam's creation the further and final purposes of God in the creation of the Mother of Mankind, and in the incarnation of the Son of God.""I But William Bell Scott, the same who, four years earlier, had pioneered in the recognition of Eve, denounced as a phantasm "the entirely gratuitous supposition of one of the numerous cherubs being the Second Person of the Trinity, or, as he [Richter] calls, him, according to Mr. Higgins, The Son of Man! That Michelangelo represented Christ here as a child is incredible."'2 Incredible to the scholars then living. The Richter hypoth- esis gathered thirty years' worth of dust until Ernst Stein- 11 A.

To his pronouncement (quoted above) that the disputed Eve is "an angel of masculine build like all the rest," he added the clincher: "And no different is the robust putto, whose shoulder is touched by Jehovah's left hand, and whom some have even designated the Son of Mary. He differs from his brothers only in not glancing at Adam and in being disgruntled [unzufrieden] and close to tears, probably because he has not yet found himself a comfortable place to watch from."' 1912-45 So much for Richter's incredible "Son of Man." Not until 1912, in Henry Thode's magisterial six-volume Michelan- gelo corpus, did the Christ prefigured in the Creation fresco regain a strong advocate. Thode agreed that the croucher in God's embrace-aquiver with life and love's craving, he wrote-is most certainly Eve, and he proceeded: Who then is the large boy at her side. .. ? I do not scruple here also to follow Richter in recognizing Christ in this Child. Strange as this interpretation may seem at first sight--was it not fitting [lag es nzcht nahe] when the preexistence of Adam's succession in the mind of God was being depicted, to hint at the "Second Adam," and precisely in relation to Eve? The expressive gesture of God's left hand and the boy's expression of sorrow have not received sufficient attention. Both are only thus understood: the act of bestowing life upon Adam entails suffering for Christ! Let it not be objected that such an interpretation goes too far .... The whole Sistine fresco cycle ... was meant to declare the necessity of the eternally preordained Savior.... The tragedy of human existence begins, manifest to the spirit of God, unbe- known to the newborn!14 Thode's eloquence, for all its exclamatory punctuation, fell on deaf ears. Another generation would have to pass before a younger scholar-Tolnay in 1945-reaffirmed Richter's po- sition. The pair under God's left arm, Tolnay wrote, "is the embodiment of the idea of Eve and Christ ... the whole future of Man is synthesized in this group."'5 1950 Case closed? On the contrary. The risk of straining the perception of Michelangelo's fresco both ways, even unto the ulterior arm of the Deity, provoked a backlash, a renewed insistence that the God-to-Adam connection in the picture was picture enough; and that no meddling from the right should be countenanced. A manifesto for the reductionist cause was Ernst Gombrich's The Story ofArt, a book for young readers whom the author, speaking of the Creation fresco, assures: "There is nothing in the picture to divert attention from the main subject." The phrase echoes Ludwig Pastor's earlier praise of the fresco: "all accessories that might distract the attention from the main subject are excluded."16 Both authors preferred to keep Eve and Christ out of sight, lest their admission consign "the main subject" to peripheral vision and weaken our appreciation of what matters most--"the first man waking ... and gazing into the fatherly face of his Maker." Gombrich admired as "one of the greatest miracles in art how Michelan- gelo has contrived thus to make the touch of the Divine hand the center and focus of the picture"; and from this focus he, like Pastor, would permit no distraction, at least not to beginners.'7 Gombrich's primer did well. But a publishing event of 1951 was at least equally influential: Skira's three volumes of color plates of Italian Renaissance paintings, part of a once-celebrated "Painting-Color-History" series.18 It is diffi- cult now to recall the historic thrill of those "Skira books," coming in glory in the lingering aftermath of World War II. Before transoceanic vacations became commonplace and color in art books routine, each Skira color plate was an event. A turning point was Skira's reproduction of the Creation of Adam (Fig. 4), for here the designer had had an idea: finding that the bodies of God and Adam served mainly to position their respective forefingers, he dismissed the prolix ensem- ble to offer instead a handsome synecdoche. Only the fingering got reproduced, and an invention of lasting power was launched. During the past forty years, the famous hand-to-hand tryst has become, in popular culture, the resume of the fresco, the gist of the whole Sistine Ceiling, Michelangelo's logo tout court, the very paradigm of high art (Fig. 5). As a sign of man s congress with God, the mutual reach of those hands glosses the covers of books on religion, while variable abridgments of the composition-cropped more or less to dock God's expendable backup at right-arrive in a welter of promotional ads and cartoons. Some of these are good fun; most are trash.19 But I save them all as so much crushing evidence: that thousands, nay millions, rejoice in this short- hand imagery as an antidote to complexity. Encouraged by high example, they welcome the minimalism that lets one consume a Michelangelo product in a sightbite. The mes- sage, delivered in both word and image, is plain: Keep your 13 ".... weil es noch keinen bequemen Aussichtspunkt finden konnte"; Steinmann (as in n. 5), 330. 14 H.

To the right half of the fresco Gombrich devotes this one sentence: "From the other side God the Father is approaching, carried and supported by His angels, wrapped in a wide and majestic mantle." In fact, God is not mantle-wrapped, nor carried by any one of the angels (see pp. 564-565, below). The omission of Eve and Christ even from longer descriptions of the Creation fresco remained standard practice throughout the 1950s. E.g., D.

TIlE CReATION1 O)F ADsAMr fDITAftL)V, A ?ta: MICHELANGELO Against the crowded background of the sixteenth century Michelangelo looms large, a tragic, Promethean figure, gifted swith perhaps the most gigantic creative force that the world has known. And if ever artist 'saw big,' it was he; always at grips ith reality, he could capture it only by magnifying it, making it larger than life. And in his writings, in eyewitness accounts, in chronicles of the period, are recorded the trials and triumphs of a genius that could never make its peace with the world. Michelangelo was born in 1475 at Caprese, a small town in the Casntino, wherehis father, Simone Buonarroti, was the mayor. As a young boy he was apprenticed to Ghirlan- daio, but, apart from some technical procedures, he learnt little from this master, whose plicid, illustrative art followed an already outmoded Quattrocento tradition. His natural bent was towards sculpture, and he owed the real start of his career to Lorenzo d' Medici, who took him into his household and, from 1488 to 1492, brought him up with his sons. Thus in the famous Medici ' Garden School ' at the Piazza di an Marco he could feast his eyes on all the treasures of ancient and contemporary art. But Lorenzo's deth atbruptly shattered the tranquillity he had so far enjoyed, and when Piero de" Medici came to power Michelangelo, foreseeing perhaps thettt impending fall of the Medici, moved to Venice and then to Bologna. At the last-named town, where he completed the carvings on St Dominic's sarcophagus, he became acquainted with the sculpture of Jatcopo della Quercia. oon after returning to Florence he set off for Rome and while there made, amongst other works of sculpture a Bacchus, actually a rather frigid, conventional production ispired by classical Antiquity, and a Pieti, a group composition, in which lie chiefly aimed at tender grace and harmony. Returning to Florence, lie started work on the famous statue of Datid wshic he 4 Page 59 from Italian Painting: The Renaissance, Geneva, Al- bert Skira, 1951 eye on the target; if Michelangelo didn't give us a simple picture, then, by Saint Minimus, make it so, and what happens elsewhere in the picture won't count. But perhaps it does count, and precisely in proportion to the attention it gets. I suspect that most Christians, including Renaissance specialists, would concede some importance to the fresco's right half if they thought it housed Eve and Christ. Therefore, the reductionist program requires a de- nial of any such presences, and a dismissal of observations by which such presences might be confirmed. For instance: Within the fresco's angelic cluster only the child under God's hand and crouching Eve are assigned settled postures, as if they rested, like Adam, on hard terrain, solid ground. Each of their levitating companions glides, hovers, or dangles; they alone exert gravity, as befits them who will know body and weight of body. The flotation that lofts the rest of the system exempts just these two-proleptically, and not surely through oversight.

The boy's gaze strikes home, like that of any infant Salvator mundi from the late quattrocento.20 And one more point, which deserves its own rubric. 1974 A brief, unpublished undergraduate paper, submitted by Michael Stolbach to a Michelangelo seminar at Hunter College, New York, considers the action of God's left hand in the fresco (Fig. 6). Its title, "Two-Finger Exercise," refers to what is self-evident: that only God's thumb and forefinger 20 The Child's eyes in the fresco present a condition problem, which I have not seen addressed in debates over the recent cleaning. Crudely superimposed on the original surface-most noticeably at the right eye-are wiry black contours, like a primitive emblem or sign: an oblong oval containing concentric circles for iris and pupil. The flat trace of these outlines contrasts painfully with Michelangelo's work, where every depicted eye is orbed and solidly socketed. I suspect early overpainting, centuries old, to which the cleaning now gives embarrassing promi- nence. The restorers evidently decided not to tamper with such old reinforcements. And, of course, the brush that imposed these impious black contours busied itself elsewhere, as at Adam's left hand and in numerous other places in the main scenes of Ceiling. These impositions will not be detected by observers looking up from the Chapel floor; in the large, often actual-size photographic details now being marketed, they are sadly conspicuous. Fortunately, the Child's hithering glance remains undeterred.</page><page sequence="7">558 THE ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 1992 VOLUME LXXIV NUMBER 4 ......................,::;--_ :- , i: . : :- ....:::- :'::i:~: -ii_:: .,; :--~;: i-i)- ~~:-~ i~i ::~-: -~ : 6 Michelangelo, Creation ofAdam, detail impress the child's shoulder. Stolbach perceived this godly gesture not as overemphatic, forced, cramped, heavy- handed, or proto-Mannerist, but as Christian. He pointed out that thumb and index are the consecrated two fingers with which alone the celebrant at the Mass touches the corpus verum, the Host. And this seems to make final sense of a gesture which in so pondered a work cannot be nugatory. The hand conveys more than a message: it not only points to the Incarnation by way of woman; it is the Father's tender of the incarnate Son in sacramental self-sacrifice; seeJohn 3:16. Thus the reserved half of the fresco foreshows-beyond the creation of Eve and the Son's humanation-the timeless rite of the Eucharist. The cleaning of the fresco in the mid-1980s confirms Stolbach's insight. It reveals that of the three or four hundred hands strewn in never-repeated positions across the Ceiling, not one was limned and transferred from cartoon to plaster with the meticulous care reserved for this left hand of God. Charcoal dust left behind by the pouncing, the spolvero, traces not merely contours but, regarding the index finger alone, the mid-knuckle pad, the skinfolds at the proximal joint, the paths lining the tendon. Evidently, in the artist's mind, the design of this manus called for absolute acribie-its status for him fully equal to the one that gets the publicity. Ambidexterity becomes an attribute of divine operation, and who dares say which hand preponderates? For myself, responding to what I see (and in light of Catholic doctrine), the matter summarizes as follows: if the Creation required but one of God's fingers, then God's greater deed-his Incarnation in woman's womb and subsequent self-immola- tion for her progeny's sake-called forth a redoubled re- source-the "two-finger exercise." In short: what God on his left has up his sleeve is not for scanting. Recent writers (Sewall, Edmund Leach, Howard Hibbard in the original 1974 edition of his Michelangelo monograph) have shown increasing willingness to admit both Eve and the child to complement Adam, and with them, implicitly, the bipolarity of the design. There is, after all, a world of difference between seeing God in a one-handed gesture, as though the spare arm were idly hung over the back of a chair, and seeing both limbs, like a seesaw's, extended. As Robert Browning remarked in another connection: "Our times are in his hands/who saith 'A whole I planned'. . . ." The composition itself and the expanded attention we give it coincide with its iconography. But not for all. Though the croucher's sex now seems fairly safe, many who balk at a pairing of Eve and Christ still see the child as a crux. And as his identity hardens, hers becomes correspondingly moot. Naming the one seems to unname the other. Was it this scruple that caused Howard Hibbard, author of the most influential American college text on Michelangelo (1974), to have second thoughts about Eve? In the revised edition of his book (1984), he decided that the croucher must, after all, be the "Immaculate Mary," presum- ably because her maternal bond with the child excludes any alternative. And Hibbard's revision was instantly taken up.21 The reasoning seems to be this: If the God-embraced figure is Eve, then the boy at her knee should be her own-begotten firstborn-but surely not Cain! On the other 21 R. S. Liebert, Michelangelo: A Psychoanalytic Study of His Life and Images, New Haven, 1983, 156, n. 13: "Some writers have concluded that the female figure is Eve (e.g., Tolnay), but I am persuaded by Hibbard (1974) that she is the Immaculate Virgin, Maria Aeterna, who, as Divine Wisdom, was with God at the Creation (Proverbs 8:22-25)." (Hibbard's "Immaculate Mary" does not appear in the 1974 edition to which Liebert refers. There Hibbard had written [p. 137] that the group of wingless angels "probably embraces unborn souls-no doubt including Eve, and probably also Jesus." In the 1984 edition [p. 137], this was altered to read: God's "left arm embraces the Immaculate Mary as he touches the unborn baby Jesus.") Cf. also the fifth and eighth-ninth editions of Helen Gardner's Art through the Ages (1970 and 1986/1991, respectively). 1970: "Beneath his sheltering arm is the as yet uncreated, but apprehensively curious, Eve." 1986/1991: "Apprehensively curious but as yet uncreated, the female figure beneath his sheltering arm, long held to represent Eve, has recently been interpreted as the Virgin Mary (with the Christ child at her knee)." One recent textbook, published by Prentice-Hall in 1989, states: "The young woman under God's arm is either Eve or Mary." Another, from the same publisher in 1990, has God's left arm embracing "a female figure who may represent Eve or the Virgin Mary." To readers of such textbooks, these identifications are presented as either certain or moot, but never with visual observations that might bear on the argument.</page><page sequence="8">WHO'S WHO IN MICHELANGELO'S CREATION OF ADAM 559 hand, if we call the child, as Hibbard does, "baby Jesus," then the mother cannot be other than "Immaculate Mary." How compelling is such ratiocination? In fact, Michelange- lo's coupling of Eve and Christ is no scandal at all. For the Trinity's Second Person bears the epithet "Son of Man" because, born of woman, he is son of Eve. And since "Son of Eve" is a trope, a metaphor to denote ultimate derivation, Michelangelo makes the metaphoricity of the trope all- apparent, almost palpable. The boy's sonship is presented as sic et non, so and not so. While his clinging reach links him to the Eve figure as to a mother, his inordinate size in relation to hers denies direct filiation. So that, respecting the visual data, we understand him to be her son, yes, but not in a literal sense. Look close: Not only does the infant head outscale the mother's, but their knees in tandem, inviting comparison, compel the perception that the baby's knee exceeds hers. Can such hypertrophy, can this colossus of overgrowth be the issue of her own loins? Pin Mary's name on that crouching nude, and you monster her babe. And the artist would be guilty of measures that make neither symbolic nor biological sense. The current anti-"formalist" bias turns away from such housekeeping matters as relative size. But Michelangelo seems to me to be juggling that variable as a semantic resource: scale is a factor in defining his dramatis personae and in promoting the plot. So among God's dozen attendants, variant scales confer grade and rank. Stripling angels are sized regardless of apparent juniority, with measurements that owe nothing to growth, as if these phaseless beings were but attributes of a universal paternity. And in at least one regard, their variable diminutions crucially influence the "main subject." For they enable Michelangelo to make visible, as had never been done before, the mystery of Adam made in the image of God. Put it this way. Since all the assembled angels share the Creator's anthropomorphic phy- sique, what is there that should render man's same anatomy special enough to be cause for astonishment? How was the singularity of Adam's godlikeness to be manifest? To which the fresco responds: by way of a proportional norm common to God and man and to none else, so that the variously minished angels have somewhat to marvel at. Did I say "to none else"? Not so; one other here, one with a man's life before him, shares that same standard: the Child whose immensity compared to his fellows marks him the Son of God and the Son of man. It is scale that sets off these three. They are of one measure, and that measure taken goes into seeing the work. But such seeing is humbling. To receive Michelangelo's thought through formal gradations such as differential proportions-to see how these alone may em- body kinship and kind-demands getting off the high horse of cogitation to measure the girth of a knee. In my book, thanks to Richter, Thode, Tolnay, and Stolbach, the identities of Eve and Christ are secure; no counterclaim has been watchful enough, and, with respect to Eve (her scale is another teaser), the alternatives merely obfuscate and impoverish. Suggestions that she be the "Immaculate Mary," Ecclesia, or Holy Wisdom would have us (1) not consider the figure's nudity; (2) not see the charged KI . . . .. .. :i~r~Al 7 Michelangelo, Creation ofAdam, detail, turned 90 degrees ambiguity of her gesture in grasping the Father's arm; (3) overlook her Venus posture and its gravitation; (4) suppress her bond with the child; (5) disregard her attraction to Adam as she eyes him, not her babe; and, finally, (6) ignore the drift of her loincloth, an interesting pendicle worth a moment's attention. I mean the fluttering scarf that trails downward at lower right. This is not (as was thought by the only writer to mention it) the cape of the nethermost angel. Since no Michelangelo drapery explodes out of nowhere, it is fitting to ask where it springs from, and the question is instantly answered. This long streamer, its vivid green so antithetical to the warm hues of Heaven, originates at Eve's upper left thigh. We are to assume that it swathes her lap and flows on submerged behind the God figure to surface again at the head of the nether angel. Note that its trail parallels the created earth, while its color, else unknown in Heaven, matches the ground that underlies Adam. I suspect that the artist meant this flutter for more than bunting run wild; issuing, as it were, from the loins of Eve, it intimates a long train of consequence, of which more below. 1990 As yet, so far as I know, the two envious imps who infest the Creation of Adam fresco have not been sighted. They came</page><page sequence="9">560 THE ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 1992 VOLUME LXXIV NUMBER 4 into view in the fall of 1990, as I gazed at an old color reproduction of the Creation fresco bought some twelve years before at the Vatican. The sighting was recorded as follows: Hid in the lower depth of the veil of Heaven (usually called a billowing mantle or cloak) are two dark angels, damnably hard to see, but once spotted, not to be thought away (Figs. 7, 9); and the closer you look, the more they distance them- selves from the rest of the party. While their fellow travelers press up to gape at earth's newest novelty-craning and stretching, not wanting to miss a thing-these two do not. To them, the sight of God's alter image rising from dust and clay brings no delight; in fact, they sulk. One of the pair lowers under God's outstretched arm, showing only a head banked on one shoulder, his cheerless face darkened by a black mop of hair. He will not look at the earthling, though the rest ooh and aah and God himself point. Overlapping him is his mate, a blond boyish figure, no less deeply engloomed but displayed at full length. And what is he doing but hiding half his averted face in his arm, scorning to see. The posture is graceless, unbecoming an angel, especially in the bend of the lower limbs, which may be mimicking the Almighty's crossed legs, or mocking Adam's-or doing both and yet more, like getting a furtive foot tangled in the green scarf that leaks from above. At this juncture, then, with God's finest handiwork in full view, the foremost of these darkling angels performs strange, twitch- like motions that are difficult to make out-but perhaps knowable through imitation, putting your own body on line. Try it sometime with an innocent bystander for a partner: throw yourself into that awkward pose, and the message from head to hoof is instantly yours. The pose feels adversarial, threatened and threatening. Your cocked elbow and doubled knee become, like those in the fresco, nocent prongs aimed at an innocent. And notice this: neither one of these peevish inmates of Heaven enjoys present contact with God. Wilfully sundered, they duck their diminished heads under one cherub's arse. Among the Creator's attendant twelve, they only are out of touch, as they are out of sorts. Michelangelo seems to envisage the creation of man as an act spurned by some of God's angels. Who might they be? Surely, we are seeing those malign spirits whom envy stirred to rebellion: Lucifer dimmed into Satan and one next subordinate-call him Beelzebub. But this is troubling. If malcontents nest here in God's very fringe, why were they not apprehended before?22 And why blow their cover at this late date? We have the authority of Vasari and the testimony of his readers that the clump of cherubim about the Creator forms one unanimous huddle. Vasari disposed of them as a nameless bunch-"nude little angels of tender age," he calls them. And no commentator thought of asking "who's who" where Michelangelo's in- formed biographer and personal friend had decreed anonymity. Moreover, we know of no pictorial precedent that impli- cates the Sons of Darkness in a creation of Adam. Is such compounding even imaginable? We are speaking, after all, of two distinct mythic events, with God agent in each, but one staged in Heaven, the other below. Even formally, given the frame's oblong format, the thing can't be done. A creation of man aligned with angelic fall would seam vertical opposites on one latitude, whereas Heaven and earth are the prime exemplars of contrasting registers. Hence no celestial distur- bance may stratify at or beneath Adam's shoulders. The leveling of such disparted poles, the very notion of altitude tilted through ninety degrees, is manifestly absurd-that is, if you think about it rather than look at the fresco, which, mirabile dictu and wonder of wonders, hyphenates high and low, earth with Heaven. Still the critic remains ill at ease. Did Michelangelo confound what immemorial practice had kept apart? The picture is admired for its inspired simplicity. Shall it now grow intricate and bedeviled? Begin by accommodating those froward fiends, and at once the perfect pitch of an idyllic moment is marred by implied sin and fall. Michelange- lo's benign Father, coming so ill-companioned, will be apporting death to Adam along with the life-and-soul-giving touch; whence would follow as well (thinking the matter through) the need for death's remedy. And all this in one picture, and in a portion of it removed from the main action? But as we have seen, the remedy, the redemption, waits in the wings. And in the absence of prior fall, what need would there be for a redeemer? So the very presence here of the bright Christ Child presupposes his diametric opposite in the shadows. And yet, in the literature on the Sistine Ceiling, the Devil has been actively missed only once-in 1969, when Sinding- Larsen indicated what he perceived as a gap in the Ceiling's iconographic structure.23 Discussing the Temptation and Expul- sion from Paradise fresco, he wrote: "In this picture the Devil, a fallen angel, is symmetrically opposed to the angel of the Lord.... In such a soteriologically and ecclesiologically consistent story as the Sistine ceiling seems to offer, one would expect the history of the angels as the first sinners to be taken into account, so that the Devil should not, as it were, appear ex nihilo." Well said and good news for the prescient author: the black hole is filled. 22 The statement made above that the two figures I am discussing have never been sighted is inaccurate. It is true that they get no mention in the literature on the fresco itself, where it might be supposed that the darkened state of the Ceiling had made them invisible. But corpuses of Michelangelo's drawings regularly refer to the more prominent of the pair in connection with a disputed sheet of figure studies in the Teylers Museum at Haarlem, A20v. See Steinmann (as in n. 5), 606 and fig. 14; B. Berenson, The Drawzngs of the Florentzne Paznters, 2nd ed., Chicago, 1938, no. 1466 (not reproduced); Dussler (as in n. 6), no. 526v (not reproduced); F. Hartt, Mzchelangelo Drawzngs, New York, 1969, no. 76 (a "superb drawing," Hartt calls it, adding a chart of previous opinions for and against). I side with Dussler and Alexander Perrig (personal communication) in disattributing the Haarlem sheet. The references in the corpuses prove that the figure in the fresco was always discernible, its congruence with the Haarlem study easily recognized. But the writers follow Vasari's blind lead in identifying the figure as merely another nondescript angel. So Steinmann (p. 328) sees "innumerable curious angels" under God's outstretched arm; and among the innumerable incurious copyists of the fresco from the 16th century onward, not one perceived anything untoward. 23 S.

Suppose him pondering the relation between these moments. The fresco presents them as nearly coeval, action and reflex in proximation. How does this accord with the doctrine? Were these convergent events conceived as initially independent of one another? Were they thought simultaneous or successive, and, if successive, were they interinvolved as cause and effect, and if so, in what order? These rhetorical questions are not put at random; they refer to two parallel traditions that descend from early Christianity down to the late seventeenth century. No dogmatic pronouncement on the subject has been delivered. But in the dominant view, prevalent at least since Saint Gregory, the point to start from is Lucifer's impulse of pride. This brightest of angels, having conceived the sinning thought non serviam, "I will not serve," marshaled against the supreme power a third part of Heaven, clashed with Saint Michael, was hurled from his station and, with all his host of rebel angels, cast into Hell, leaving behind those vast vacancies which mankind was designed to replenish. Redress by refill. This doctrine, which presumes to explain God's motive for the creation of man, became standard teaching from patris- tic to modern times. In Joyce's A Portrait of the Artzst as a Young Man (chap. 3), the Jesuit preacher at Belvedere College, delivering the first of his Lenten sermons on the Four Last Things, opens as follows: -Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first parents, and you will remember that they were created by God in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Even Milton's God supports the replacement theory: finding Heaven "dispeopled," he shrugs with almighty iro- ny-"I can repair that detriment."24 The creation of man, then, was suggested to God, or necessitated by, the rebel angels' foregoing defection- whose first cause remains to this day somewhat uncertain. The Paraclete has not made it known whether Lucifer's mutinous thought was directed against his Maker's domin- ion, against upstart man made in God's image, or against a foreplanned incarnation that would unite God with man and slight the angelic state.25 Only this much we know: Lucifer- Satan's apostasy depleted Heaven, whereupon, to make up the deficit, procreant man and woman were brought into being; and they, being blessed with the God-framed poten- tial to freely emulate angelic obedience, were expected to enter Heaven and replenish God's realm.26 So much for the standard version-which Michelangelo's Creation fresco does not choose to follow. An earlier tradition reverses the sequence: it is the prior creation of man that pricks Lucifer's envy. The legend is traceable to the beginning of the Common Era, and though it failed to enter the scriptural canon, Jewish or Christian, it remained common lore. It stands prominent in the Koran. Two pseudepigraphical texts, derived or adapted from earlier Jewish sources, preserve the story in its oldest known versions. I quote from the Apocryphal Vita Adae (The Life of Adam and Eve), a work familiar to medieval and Renaissance readers, wherein Satan converses with Adam:27 [12] And the devil sighed and said, "O Adam, all my enmity and envy and sorrow concern you, since because of you I am expelled and deprived of my glory which I had in the heavens in the midst of angels, and because of you I was cast out onto the earth." Adam answered, "What have I done to you, and what is my blame with you? Since you 24 Joyce's Jesuit sources are found and admirably discussed in Elizabeth F. Boyd, "Joyce's Hell-Fire Sermons," in W. E. Morris and C. A. Nault, Jr., eds., Portrazts of an Artzst: A Casebook onJamesJoyce's "A Portrazt of the Artzst as a Young Man," New York, 1962, 253-263. For the quotation from Milton, see Paradise Lost, vii, 152-153. And cf. lines 187-191 for Milton's song of the angels: Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd Good out of evil to create, in stead Of spirits malign a better race to bring Into their vacant room. ... As the doctrine was recently summarized: "The world is created in order ultimately to repopulate heaven after one-third of the angels defected" (J. Rosenblatt, reviewing R. M. Schwartz's Bzblzcal Creatzon zn "Paradise Lost," 1988, in Renazssance Quarterly, XLIV, Spring 1991, 175). The sources are, of course, overabundant. But I cannot resist citing from Saint Bonaventure's Lzfe of Saint Franczs (vi, 6, ed. London, 1926, 62), the account of a "vision sent from heaven made evident unto a Brother that was of an especial holiness": "He beheld among many seats in heaven one that was more honorable than the rest.... Marvelling within himself at the splendour of this exalted throne, he began to consider with anxious thought who should be deemed worthy to sit thereon. Then, as he considered, he heard a voice saying unto him: 'This seat pertained unto one of the fallen Angels, and is now kept for the humble Francis."' 25 In Protestant theology, Lucifer's downfall was brought on by his protest against the elevation of the Son as King-Messiah; see Stella P. Revard's excellent work The War zn Heaven: "Paradzse Lost" and the Traditzon of Satan's Rebellzon, Ithaca, 1980, passzm (brought to my attention by the Milton scholar Robert McMahon). Whether this doctrine is relevant to Michelangelo's fresco (I think not) is a delicate problem beyond the scope of this paper. 26 Concerning the manner of propagation, had the Fall not occurred: According to SaintJohn Chrysostomos (Hom. zn Gen., 18, 4), Edenic man abiding in prelapsarian virginity would have imitated the life of the angels; the human race would have multiplied, as the angels do, only by God's own creative act. So also taught Saint Gregory of Nyssa (De hominzs opzficzo, 17): that procreation followed the Fall, making imparadised life resemble that of the angels. Saint Augustine, on the contrary, argued that Adam and Eve would have procreated even in Eden, but without lust and birth pangs; and that their progeny, having lived just and obedient lives of sufficient duration, would, in the absence of death, see their bodies refine into spiritual, angel-like substance -"to be changed into a more blessed form like the angels, not by the death of the body but by the power of God" (On the Lzteral Meanzng of Geneszs, 9, 3 and 6; trans. J. H. Taylor [Anczent Chrzstzan Wrzters, XLII], New York, 1982, 77). Likewise Saint Bernard foresees that members of the human race would one day be raised to be the angels' equals in glory (On the Song of Songs, 17, 3, 5; trans. K. Walsh, Spencer, Mass., 1971, 129). So also Milton's Archangel Raphael to Adam before the Fall, following their shared meal: ". . . time may come when men/With angels may participate. ... Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit ...," etc. (Paradzse Lost, v, 493-494, 498). 27 Vzta Adae, 12-16, trans. M. D.Johnson, inJ. H.

[13] The devil replied, " .. When God blew into you the breath of life and your countenance and likeness were made in the image of God, Michael ... made [us] worship you in the sight of God, and the Lord God said, 'Behold Adam! I have made you in our image and likeness.' [14] And Michael ... called all the angels, saying, 'Wor- ship the image of the Lord God, as the Lord God has instructed.' And Michael himself worshiped first.... And I answered, .... 'I will not worship one inferior and subsequent to me. I am prior to him in creation .... Let him worship me.' [15] When they heard this, other angels who were under me refused to worship him .... [16] And the Lord God was angry with me and sent me with my angels out from our glory; and because of you we were expelled ... from our dwellings and have been cast onto the earth .... And we were pained to see you in such bliss of delights. So with deceit I assailed your wife and made you to be expelled through her from the joys of your bliss, as I have been expelled from my glory." Poor Devil; hearing his plaint, one is half-tempted to sympathize. But Michelangelo's fresco, though it stages the Adam-first version, forestalls compassion; his revolting wretches, wanting Satanic glamour, appear properly stripped of appeal. The legend of Adam's antecedent creation followed by Satan's rancor was current among early Christians. Both Justin Martyr and his pupil Tatian (second century A.D.) refer to it, and Saint Irenaeus (ca. 200 A.D.) takes Satan's surly response to the masterwork of the sixth day for granted. "This was the apostate angel and the enemy," he writes, "because he was envious of God's workmanship." In Tertul- lian's treatise on patience (ca. 200 A.D.), the sight of Adam made in God's image and given sway over created nature makes Satan succumb to impatience, envy, and grief. And so in a sermon preached by Saint Cyprian (ca. 250 A.D.): He who was sustained in angelic majesty, he who was accepted and beloved of God, when he beheld man made in the image of God, broke forth into jealousy with malevolent envy. ... .28 Even Saint Augustine cites the Adam-first version-with reservations: "Some say that he [the Devil] fell from the heavenly abode because he envied man made to the image of God."29 And no fewer than seven pertinent references occur in the Koran, where God, speaking to man, declares: "And we created you, then we fashioned you, then we said unto the angels, 'Adore Adam,' and they adored, save Iblis [Satan] . . . Said He [God], 'What hinders thee from adoring when I order thee?' He said, 'I am better than he; Thou has created me from fire, and him Thou hast created out of clay.' Said He [God], 'Then go down ...; what ails thee that thou shouldst be big with pride . . . verily upon thee is my curse unto the day of judgment.' "30 Scriptural in Islam, the legend of the Adamic occasion for Satan's envy may have been viewed in Christian theology as a somewhat suspect alternative; the more so since Saint Augus- tine had declared the primary sin to have been not envy but pride, Invidza being a consequence of Superbia. Yet medieval poems gladly followed the pseudepigraphic Lzfe ofAdam and Eve, which survives in two dozen-odd manuscripts, including three from the ninth to twelfth centuries.31 Hence it is no surprise to find the story familiar to Saint Bernard. "Is it possible," Bernard asks in his seventeenth sermon on Canti- cles, that Lucifer, son of the morning, yielding precipitately to the impulse of pride, began to envy the outpouring of oil on our human race before he was cast out into the darkness? In the rage that possessed him did he murmur and say to himself: "Why this waste?" I do not hold that the Holy Spirit has made this known, nor do I hold the contrary; I simply do not know. But even though some may think it incredible ... he could have foreseen that members of the human race would one day be raised to be his equals in glory.... Then, stung by a wild impulse of envy, he plotted to maintain as subjects those whom he scorned as companions.32 Saint Bernard is being cautious-unassertive where the Holy Spirit has not lighted the way. But four centuries later, Michelangelo's contemporary Martin Luther, citing Ber- nard's authority, speculated that Lucifer might have had a 28 Justin Martyr, Dzalogue wzth Trypho, 79, Pat. gr., vI, 662-663, in The Ante-Nzcene Fathers, I, Grand Rapids, n.d., 238.

The angels are much holier than we poor sinners, and yet He adopted our nature. .. . This fact elicited the awe of St. Bernard and gave rise to many fine thoughts, found especially in his devotions. He gave it as his opinion that this had caused the archfiend Lucifer's fall and eviction from heaven. Perhaps Lucifer, so St. Bernard supposed, had foreknowledge of God's eternal resolution to become a man in time, and not an angel. This provoked his insolence against God. He was aware, of course, that he was a creature more beautiful and excellent in appearance than man. This also aroused his envy of mankind; he begrudged man the high honor of God's assumption of human nature. This vexed him and his companions. They became envious when they learned that God would despise them and assume human nature. Therefore Lucifer and his hosts fell and were driven out of heaven.33 Note Luther's explicit "therefore." He allows-at least as an alternative possibility-that the rebel angels' first sin was resentment of the creation of man and of God's humanation in petto. But such speculation, conducted under unenlight- ened conditions, was decried by Calvin as futile and ill- advised: What concern is it to us to know anything more about devils.... Some persons grumble that Scripture does not in numerous passages set forth systematically and clearly that fall of the devils, its cause, manner, time, and character. But because this has nothing to do with us, it was better not to say anything, or at least to touch upon it lightly, because it did not befit the Holy Spirit to feed our curiosity with empty histories to no effect. And we see that the Lord's purpose was to teach nothing in his sacred oracles except what we should learn to our edification. Therefore, lest we ourselves linger over superfluous mat- ters... .34 Superfluous perhaps for the salvation of souls, but not so to the imagination of artists. When, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the revolt in Heaven became a prime subject of new epic and dramatic poetry, Satan's motives, his psychology, along with his bellicosity, took center stage. And for several poets-Valvasone in 1590, Marini in 1610, Valmarana, 1623, Heywood, 1635, Vondel, 1654-Satan's primitive sin, while yet enheavened, was precisely his grief over the creation of man, and his envy.35 Even Milton makes room for the Invidia alternative, not by predating Adam's actual creation, but by crediting Lucifer (and Beelzebub) with prior knowledge of God's intention to initiate the new race. And as late as ca. 1700, the American Samuel Willard, speculating upon "The ground of [the rebel angels'] apostasy," concluded that "they reckoned them- selves to be degraded in being employed to minister for man. ... Hereupon ... they are filled with malice against God and man." So much and more from Willard's lectures at Harvard. They deposit us at the end point of an ancient, intermittent tradition some fifteen centuries old.36 The post-Renaissance dramas and epics that treat Satan's revolt as a reflex to the elevation of man drew from the same hoard of legend and theological speculation that had in- spired Michelangelo in 1510.37 The artist's conception of the event, spread beltwise across the Sistine Ceiling, anticipates by some eighty years a major theme of late Renaissance and Baroque poetry. But with this among other differences: the poets, in emulation of Homer, Virgil, and Tasso, blow Satan out into an epic hero; Michelangelo allows Invidia no heroic dimension; to envy-driven foes of man and God he concedes nothing but joyless squalor. Why Michelangelo chose the Adam-first version is appar- ent from the picture itself. As he presents the Creation, the human race in its pristine embodiment is not the vision of a replacement. Michelangelo's Adam, God's own commensu- rate, is a culminant masterwork, long-intended, and of such exalted perfection and privilege that even angels break forth in envy. Why else those pinched gripers, nested so near 33Martin Luther, Sermons on the Gospel of St.John, 7, 14, in Luther's Works, xxII, ed. J. Pelikan, trans. M. H. Bertram, St. Louis, 1957, 103. The passage is cited in Revard (as in n. 25), 73, along with a passage from the 16th-century theologian Zanchi, who "concurs with Luther's view, remarking that the angels' sin, for which they fell, was the sin of envy for the gift of grace the Son was to confer on mankind." 34 Calvin, Instztutes of the Chrzstzan Relzgzon, I, xiv, 16; trans.

Kirkconnell, The Celestzal Cycle: The Theme of "Paradise Lost" zn World Lzterature, New York, 1967, and Revard (as in n. 25). In the Dutch poet Vondel's drama Luczfer (1654), the eponymous hero, still Heaven's brightest, broods on God's youngest creature: He is the friend of Heaven. Our slavery Even now begins. Go hence, rejoice and serve And honor this new race like servile slaves. For God was man created; we, for him. Let then the angels bend their necks beneath His feet.... Beelzebub, Lucifer's second, responds: The massive gate of Heaven stands ajar For Adam's seed. An earth-worm that hath crawled Out of the dust-out of a clod of clay Defies thy power.... Lucifer: That shall I thwart, if in my power it be. See Vondel's Luczfer, trans. L. C. Van Noppen, New York and London, 1898, 296, 297.

London, National Gallery between man and God, cringing in aversion from Adam? Seeing the fresco whole, we receive its full message: God's boon and the Devil's bane intermixed among things to come. Things to come? Observe that the Devil's foot, and perhaps his occulted left arm, are already entangled in the loose cloth that falls from the lap of Eve. 1991 You reread Vasari on the Creation fresco and find him to be the primary source for the ever-repeated assertion that God is being carried (portato) by a group of angels-which just isn't so. Why, then, did he say it? Three possible (possibly interrelated) reasons suggest themselves. First, a scriptural association: where Psalm 17:11 envisages God in motion, "He ascended upon the cherubim, and He flew, He flew upon the wings of the wind" (et ascendit super cherubim et volavit). So the idea of God riding on bearer- angels was in the air, and Vasari's ekphrasis may just be another instance of projecting upon a picture what one remembers from a known text. Second: interference from a memory image. Vasari ad- mired Peruzzi's Adoration of the Magi (1522; Fig. 8) as a "cosa maravigliosissima." Its upper zone, adapting Michelangelo's motif of divine arrival, presents again God the Father amidst cherubim, but as a demiurge grown so enfeebled since the stressful days of the hexaemeron, that now, at this first Christmas, his decrepitude needs all the lifting he gets. Vasari, writing from memory-or perhaps with an aide- m6moire in the form of a cursory sketch-may have confused Peruzzi's underpropped Father figure with Michelangelo's. Third: like most of his readers, Vasari may have misread the action of the smooth glider under God's thigh.38 No other candidate among God's twelve attendants qualifies even remotely for carrier action, and the figure's right hand could well be thought to support the Lord's knee. However, since that right hand is hidden, its operation must be 38 Most authors, with the honorable exception of Tolnay, repeat after Vasari and put all God's companions to load-bearing work. A few pick out the streaker: Hartt (as in n. 22), 81, no. 76, speaks of "the nude angel upholding the Lord's right leg"; Dussler (as in n. 6), 244, no. 526v, of the angel "der an der Unterseite Gottvater stfitzt." When R. Kuhn (Michelan- gelo: Die Sixtinische Decke, Berlin, 1975, 28) writes "Gott faihrt, auf einem der Engel gelagert, dahin" ("God proceeds, couched on one of the angels"), it is still this same underling he has in mind. Gombrich, on the other hand (see n. 17, above), would not single him out, lest such focus "divert attention from the main subject."</page><page sequence="14">N, liey~~cY~ qc __ Iyl 107 ''S .2il 44 / 4, 1/00- ,1, IrI jo,, ;JP 4i * Michelangelo, Creation ofAdam, Vatican, Sistine Chapel (?Nippon Television Network Corporation, Tokyo, 1991)</page><page sequence="15">4 . a - tr'  IV - -A ?

Speak of an elbow these days, and up goes the cry of formalism, or voyeurism, or fetishism. Indeed, an odd elbow is not a promising candidate for an epiphany. Yet this one, beheld in its territorial context, helps consummate the fresco's subplot, defining the glider's pose and his valor in defense of Heaven. Briefly stated: the glider's right arm is not supinated, as it would have to be to produce an upturned palm under a load; the arm is pulled back and pronated with elbow out, an action best understood when the figure is viewed upright, as though it were striding. (Fig. 9; since the overall imagery of the Ceiling addresses multiple orientations, an ad hoc turn through ninety degrees seems permissible.) Not that I mean to downplay the glider's weightlessness, which underscores God's own drift. But his present tilt--easy come to an aerialist of his class-translates a specific stance, a confrontational posture that becomes more intelligible with the body erect. Describe the action: a right-footed stride; a right arm retracted from its swiveled shoulder; the head in abrupt counter-spin facing Lucifer; and the left arm .... Wait, what left arm-does it show? Yes, the painter accommodates just enough arm to stage a heroic action. But it's a squeezed portion he shows, and I used to find it incomprehensible. The vestige I saw looked like a bobby sock at the ankle of the little tyke at God's neck. Yet this triangular segment, wedged between the glider's blond locks and God's hip, is roundly modeled and, its paucity notwithstanding, sufficient to project a raised arm-a gallant arm interposed as though to shield God from Satanic ill-will. I suggest that this martial posture (compare the Hercules in Michelangelo's early Centaurs relief) defines the figure as the champion of Heaven. One had always supposed that his head turned only to keep Adam in view. That first impression is not ruled out-it accords with the horizontal reading. But now, in the stacked upright of the subplot, given his whole body's posture (and singular beauty), the glider's immediate object of confronta- tion is Lucifer. And this confirms a hunch long entertained but muted so long as the figure, traduced by Vasari's haste, served only as Father's little helper, "supporting him who needs no support" (Scott). Now, with both arms, including one exterior elbow, on show, we are in on his enterprise and divine his identity.

If Michelangelo knew his Archangel to be safely domiciled on the Ceiling, Michael's puzzling exclusion from the altar wall takes on a slightly different cast. But this, for once, is pure speculation. Ijust like to think that Michelangelo would rather engage his name saint in defense of Heaven than as a weigher of fellow souls.</page><page sequence="17">566 THE ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 1992 VOLUME LXXIV NUMBER 4 encounter with Michael, which implies imminent tumble from Heaven and further consequences too depressing to itemize. On God's counter side, diametrically opposite the rebel angels, appears the ordained redemption through the woman-born Christ. Note that the flowing contour of the celestial envelope, Heaven's upended cope, is twice disturbed: by a nick, bottom left, where the Devil makes his grab for a portion of it; and at upper right where it gathers in a nota bene pointed to the Redeemer. 2001 ... Hearing me expound the identities of these five-Eve and the Christ Child ("some tots!"), Lucifer with sidekick, and Saint Michael-a colleague desires to know whether I had identified the rest of God's entourage in the fresco and, if not, was it wise to rush into print with an incomplete roster? Give it time, I said to myself. Remember how long it took before anyone spotted our cherished Eve. Until 1871, she was just one in a crowd. And the outsize boy at her knee did not get singled out until four years later, so that Christ entered the picture-or entered our picture of it-exactly 365 years after the fresco was painted. And from that first recognition to the detection of Antichrist in a dark pocket of Heaven, check off another 115 years, and then another twelvemonth to admit the Archangel Michael-which brings us to 1991. Allowing a decent interval to assimilate these late comers should take us past the millennium. And we ought to leave the twenty-first century something to do.
