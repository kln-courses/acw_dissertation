<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Zealand Slavonic Journal, vol. 45 (2011) Lauren Benjamin (Sonoma State University) THE LOST CAUSE OF POETRY: RESISTANCE AND RE-CREATION IN BRUNO SCHULZ'S "TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH" Bruno Schulz, born in the sleepy Eastern European town of Drohobycz in 1892, was, by all accounts, a strange and solitary man. Awkward and introspective, Schulz spent his days teaching high school drawing—a profession he loathed—in order to support his ailing mother, as well as his widowed sister and her sons. Rarely did he socialize. His free time, painfully infrequent, was reserved for the work that really mattered to him: image creation in written and visual form. On brief respites, he created fantastic narratives which seem to exist as if drawn from somewhere illusory yet familiar, at once transformative and reflective. Though Schulz rarely left Drohobycz, his stories seem to transcend the realities not just of southeastern Poland, but the confines of normative humanity altogether. Schulz's work is, in some fundamental way, a re-visioning of the world. At the close of his 1936 essay "The Mythologizing of Reality," Schulz considers the uncanny ability of words to rise above the corporeal world, to both render the inexplicable and transform living breath from stale air; he laments our careless discounting of myth in favor of more accurate "reality" and argues "the reverse would be more accurate: reality is but a shadow of the word."1 For Schulz, the work of the author is not simply in creating tales that amuse or distract; rather, it is a noble and essential profession that sees its aim as both challenging the world and reinventing it. Even the most cursory look at Schulz's brief oeuvre presents a clear view of this principle in practice: in the face of looming war and a divided nation-state, Schulz creates a transformative autho-mythology in which his father turns into a bird, Pan appears as a man in a grubby jacket, apocalyptic comets threaten, and anthropomorphic landscapes abound. Bom under the Austro-Hungarian rule of Galicia—in a town that was to become incorporated into Poland, and later, after Schulz's death, to Ukraine—Schulz was actively working from within a milieu that was both oppressive and ffighteningly volatile. His response was fantasy. 1 Ficowski, Jerzi, ed. Letters and Drawings of Bruno Schulz.

After an upswing in what Dieter De Bruyn and Kris Van Heuckelom called "Schulzmania" in the 1990's,2 Schulz may have captured the hearts and minds of Eastern Europeans again, but far too little of that reverence has translated to the English speaking West. In her study of Polish-Jewish Literature between the wars, an area of literature she calls "now almost forgotten," Eugenia Pokop Janiec provides two brief references to Schulz and, even then, only as a name in a series3. In other, less recent compendiums of interwar history, Schulz's oeuvre is omitted altogether4. Perhaps this is due to the ethereal nature of Schulz's work: neither realist, nor allegorical, Schulz's Polish Jewish experience is backgrounded, while the reality of myth is upheld as paramount. Although this has not been a problem for Polish audiences, as De Bruyn and Van Heuckelom's compendium attests, Western audiences are arguably more inclined to draw a thick line between the historical and allegorical. However, this should not stop the critic from locating Schulz's work historically; for although the connections may not be explicit, there is nonetheless an implicit reflection of the turning tide of Eastern Europe Jewry in these fantastical narratives. For this paper, my goal in exploring Bruno Schulz's chapter of Sklepy cynamonowe entitled "Traktat o manekinach" is two-fold. Firstly, I would like to situate Schulz's work within the context of interwar Poland and from the perspective of a Jewish "other" advocating for the voiceless. And secondly, I would like to show how Schulz simultaneously overturns this "othered" viewpoint altogether and symbolically resists the categorization of "other" by creating an alternative mythology of life. It is my assertion that the strength of the story—surreal, visual, fantastical, realist, or otherwise—to act as a force greater than itself should not be overlooked; as Schulz notes, "The spirit's first and foremost function is to tell stories and to make up 'tales.' The driving force of human knowledge is 2 De Bruyn, Dieter and Kris van Heuckelom, eds.

The uncomfortable question of where to place the autobiographic mythologies of Bruno Schulz is one that has plagued Schulz critics—not to mention those publishing house employees challenged with summing it up on dust jackets—for decades. Since Schulz's brief period of production began in the early 1930's, he has been alternately deemed a tragic writer, a comic writer, an absurdist, a satirist, an autobiographer, a mythographer, a poet, a modernist, and a post-modernist.6 Part of the difficulty in placing the work has to do with its unique linguistic style—more poetry than fiction, some would argue—and still other difficulties arise with the blurred boundaries between reality and fiction. In the story "Traktat о manekinach" the narrator's eccentric father gives two heretical lectures on life and lifelessness; one is entitled "Treatise on Tailors' Dummies, or The Second Book of Genesis" and the other "Treatise on Tailors' Dummies: Conclusion." On this "nameless Tuesday," the narrator, along with a small crowd of female shopkeepers, listens, apprehensively: 'there is no dead matter," he taught us, "lifelessness is only a disguise behind which hide unknown forms of life. The range of these forms is infinite and their shades and nuances limitless. The Demiurge was in possession of important and creative recipes. Thanks to them, he created a multiplicity of species which renew themselves by their own devices. No one knows whether these recipes will ever be reconstructed. But this is unnecessary, because even if the classical methods of creation should prove inaccessible for evermore, there still 5 Ficowski, Jerzi, ed. Letters and Drawings of Bruno Schulz.

The Heresiarch is a modern day alchemist, one who seeks to form an alternative creation myth in which the dross of the everyday is transformed into animate gold. His is a last-ditch effort to recover what has been lost, to give words to that which has wordlessly sustained him; in the previous section of Sklepy cynamonowe, his precious collection of rare birds are carelessly let out of a window and stoned by villagers, rendering the once magnificent father "a broken man." Schulz's narrator begins "Traktat о manekinach" with the brief recapitulation of "the affair of the birds" as "the last colorful and splendid counteroffensive of fantasy" his father was to embark upon. Moreover, these "unknown forms of life" of which the Heresiarch speaks are as essential to nature as are the more familiar forms we are accustomed to. In no small way, Schulz and his family were familiar with the world's tendency to overlook "unknown forms of life." Bom into an emerging Polish state that had previously welcomed Jewish immigrants— however minimally9—the Jews of the newly formed Polish state lived a precarious existence. Yet, in spite of repeated threats to their religion, personhood, and claim to rights, the newly emerging Polish state was what Harry M. Rabinowicz calls "a period of religious renaissance:" It marked a reemphasis on Torah, and the reemergence of a Shulchan Aruch Jew for whom the Torah was all-embracing and all-sufficient. It was "hard to be a Jew," but it was compensatingly "good to be a Jew." In an age of systematic 7 All large chunks of text from Bruno Schulz's fiction in this essay utilize the artful translation of Celina Wieniewska in the English-language version of Sklepy cynamonowe published as The Street of Crocodiles by Viking Penguin Inc., 1977.

It is no mere accident that the years in which Bruno Schulz wrote saw an unprecedented reemergence of Polish-Jewish community. Although Bruno Schulz's family was not strictly religious and Schulz never learned to read Yiddish, he was, as Jerzy Ficowski notes "not indifferent to myths or sacred rites."11 As such, Schulz's stories retain the essence of Jewish mythology if not the realism of everyday Jewish life. Schulz's work has been read in light of the Kabbalah12, Hasidic Judaism13 and various other Jewish origins, but I should like to suggest that Schulz's work more accurately reflects an ebb and flow of Jewish modernism. Although there existed a flowering of Jewish communities, it would be a mistake to overemphasize Jewish autonomy in the interwar years. It was during this time, for example, that anti-Jewish tropes "had their strongest political and social influence." 14 Moreover, anti-Jewish scapegoating in the form of campaign language and imagery was present in the Soviet occupation (1939-1941) as well as the Nazi occupation (1939 1945), both of which Schulz experienced. 15 This, too, is no mere coincidence. The sort of ethnic nationalism that thrives on alterity is the very antithesis of Schulz's fantastical narratives; instead of borders and schism, Schulz battles the unknown by transforming disorder into sublimity. As Karen Underhill notes in her essay comparing Martin Buber to Schulz, this generation of writers "can fruitfully be placed within a constellation of assimilated Jewish intellectuals...whose work reveals an attempt to incorporate Jewish philosophical and mystical heritage into 10 Rubinowiscz, Harry M.

The relationship between the father and son-narrator in Sklepy cynamonowe mirrors this dual existence of acceptance and excusivism— nowhere is it better articulated than in "Traktat o manekinach". While the older narrator of the chapter looks back on these episodes with a wistful admiration and sense of unappreciated "magic," his younger self and the rest of the lectures' participants fail to acknowledge the wisdom of the speaker. Modeled on Schulz's father, who was born in 1846 and lived through an uneasy time in Jewish-Polish history, the father of "Traktat о manekinach" is a sort of Cassandra figure, doomed to prophesy the truth of humanity's cruelty to obstinate ears. For his part, the "Heresiarch" presents both of his "Traktat о manekinach" lectures as if it were a very real battle between life and death. Immediately preceding "Traktat о manekinach" the father is transformed from an eccentric, magical dreamer into "a broken man, an exiled kind who had lost his throne and his kingdom."17 His response in "Traktat о manekinach", however, is far from defeatist. Inspired by an ordinary evening's sewing session, he proceeds in "charming both of the young ladies with the magnetism of his strange personality."18 Despite donning the "worried hangdog expression" of "complete defeat" in the previous chapter, the father has succeeded in retaining his bizarre charm as well as his determination: His gestures acquired an esoteric solemnity. He half-closed one eye, put two fingers to his forehead while a look of extraordinary slyness came over his face. He transfixed his listeners with these looks, violated with his cynical expression their most intimate and private reserve, until he had reached them in the furthest corner whither they had retreated, pressed them against the wall, and tickled them with the finger of 16 Underbill, Karen.

The father, then, has the power of a demi-god, able to touch and entreat his listeners merely with the strength of his overwhelming presence. This is a far cry from the "broken" man we see after "the affair of the birds," but perhaps this is precisely where the father's strength lies: after such a crushing defeat, he is that much more vehement about the importance of his fantastical work. The other inhabitants of the house, however, only listen to the father's tirades out of boredom and are blissfully unaware of his "sovereign magic" until, as in the case of the narrator, much later. After several detailed episodes of the father's eccentricities, Schulz presents the listeners of his "Traktat o manekinach" talks as listless participants all too familiar with his particular brand of fanaticism. They are "used to the splendid showmanship" of the father and, thus, are "inclined to underrate" its value.19 Moreover, the "showmanship" of the spectacle is all that they are disposed to see; they listen, but only as one listens to a clown: for entertainment rather than enlightenment. Despite his charisma and the enchantment of his heretical statements, the Heresiarch may as well be talking to himself; the narrator notes that he did not know "on whose behalf [his] father was proclaiming these demands, what community or corporation, sect or order supported him loyally and lent the necessary weight to his words."20 There must have been something behind these weighty words, he thinks, but then admits, "as for us, we did not share these demiurgical aspirations."21 The father's audience, in other words, is not sympathetic to his cause, nor are they even particularly interested. One of the father's main preoccupations in his "Traktat о manekinach" lectures is an identification—even to the point of a certain conflation of identities—with inanimate objects. For Schulz's father figure, animate matter is something that is both within and without the human— not only is the human not privileged in its acquisition of life, lifelessness itself has no place in his worldview. Life may be dormant, but never is it inherently absent. As such, objects, people, and natures feature with equal 19 Ibid., p. 51 20 Ibid., p. 61. 21 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">52 LAUREN BENJAMIN prominence. In one particularly evocative episode of his lecture, the Heresiarch expresses concern for all the variegated natural and unnatural forms that have been counted as singular; "How much ancient suffering is there in the varnished grain, in the veins and knots of our old familiar wardrobes? Who would recognize them in the old features, smiles, and glances, almost planed and polished out of all recognition?"22 Here the Heresiarch argues for an understanding of wood, as well as other, what he calls "fragmentary forms of life," that necessitates empathy and identification. We may have dominated them, split their beams, and made them into dresser drawers, but that doesn't undo their suffering. In this way, the Heresiarch echoes not just the suffering of objects but of marginalized peoples as well, which does much to explain the fervency with which the "Traktat o manekinach" lectures are presented. As if to underscore this identification, the narrator notes that his father, while speaking, "began to resemble an old plank full of knots and veins, from which all memories had been planed away."23 Moreover, the Heresiarch proclaims that he, and those nameless others who share his heretical viewpoints, "shall give priority to trash" and are "simply entranced and enchanted by the cheapness, shabbiness, and inferiority of material."24 Existence, and life in general, is not necessarily a beautiful thing, nor is it composed of intelligent or divine parts; life, rather, has potential to flourish in anything. As such, the Heresiarch self admittedly sympathizes with paper-máché, sawdust, and the exquisite forms his seamstresses "have taken." Nature is something of an endlessly spiraling arm, enveloping all in lifelike divinity. In this way, Schulz advocates for the voiceless other—be it object or person. In giving voice to the silent, marginalized, and otherwise overlooked object, he both reflects and challenges the constrictive silence of his Jewish history. It would not be difficult to draw a line from the Heresiarch's pleas for an understanding of the suffering of wood to the suffering of human beings, a subject of much preoccupation for the Jews of interwar Poland. In "Traktat о manekinach," Schulz utilizes fantasy as a vehicle to convey a very serious message about not just the object, but the objectified person. 22 Ibid., p. 69. 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid., p. 62.</page><page sequence="9">THE LOST CAUSE OF POETRY 53 One would be remiss, though, to discount the timelessness of Schulz's work. Although the father figure of "Traktat o manekinach" can be said to represent the old Jewish generation of pre-Polish Galicia, he simultaneously epitomizes the archetypal dreamer whose aspirations are squelched by the ordinary and everyday. In no small way, this directly parallels Schulz's own dual existence as a schoolteacher and creator of fantastical tales. In a letter to Waclaw Czarski, the Chief Editor of Tygodnik Illustrowany, Schulz wrote: I don't know if I can stand this drudgery much longer. School today is not the school of an earlier day, that veritable idyll among professions—almost a sideline, maintaining a modest position on the backdrop of life. Since it cut its teeth, it has run rampant with shameless presumption, it has turned demanding, raising ever more badly a claim to be the entire content of a person's life. [...] Every day I leave that scene brutalized and soiled inside, filled with distaste for myself and so violently drained of energy that several hours are not enough to restore it.25 Schulz lived for his brief, infrequent respites from teaching and, even when those were granted, claimed to feel too drained and depressed to write more than briefly. For him, the mundane duties that we attend to out of necessity are enough to render a person spiritually vapid; it is this spiritual decay that the primordial word of his essay "The Mythologizing of Reality" frees us from. In a similar way, the father figure of "Traktat о manekinach" utilizes his heretical doctrines and bouts of fantasy as a form of resistance against worldly ennui. In his discussion of "pseudovegetation" in the conclusion of "Traktat о manekinach," he begins to resemble the apartments he describes, whose wallpapers, "bored with the incessant changes in all the cadenzas of rhythm" become "susceptible to distant, dangerous dreams."26 Out of this boredom arises a fermentation of matter in which new forms grow and flourish; the Heresiarch, as well as his creator Bruno Schulz, is a similar assemblage, weaving weary boredom into dreams. 25 Ficowski, Jerzi, ed. Letters and Drawings of Bruno Schulz. New York: Fromm International Publishing Corporation, 1990. 98-99 26 Ibid., p. 67.</page><page sequence="10">54 LAUREN BENJAMIN Although he does not realize it at the time of the Heresiarch's lecture, the narrator of "Traktat o manekinach," in telling the tale, comes to sympathize with his father, as he notes that: Only now do I understand the lonely hero who alone waged war against the fathomless, elemental boredom that strangled the city. Without any support, without recognition on our part, that strangest of men was defending the lost cause of poetry. He was like a magic mill, into the hoppers of which the bran of empty hours was poured, to re-emerge flowering in all the colors and scents of Oriental spices.27 Perhaps a large part of this narrator is Schulz himself, who catalogs the ways in which "drudgery" has rendered the writer a small husk of a man. Mentions of depression abound in Schulz's remaining letters; in this way, the Heresiarch can be rewritten as someone for whom loneliness, depression, and boredom are the real enemies. In spinning his tales and fantastical, heretical doctrines, he is not just passing the time or speaking to hear himself talk. According to the narrator, he is utilizing the dross of boredom as a catalyst through which his "magic mill" creates "flowering" gold. Although this is important once situated in its historical context, in many ways Schulz's writing resists such a realistic location. The day on which the father begins his lectures is a "nameless Tuesday," which is marked significant not by a year a particular era but a plate of "two large fish in jelly lying side by side, head-to-tail."28 Although this meal has the ritual of a religious feast, its description is devoid of the specifics that would allow it to be read as anything traditional. Rather, this is a day that exists outside of calendar time and though it is "a day that had at last achieved an identity," that identity is not one that is easily recognizable.29 The weeks leading up to the incident "passed under the sign of a strange drowsiness," leading the reader to believe that the time that matters to the characters of "Traktat о manekinach" is the sort that is made up of strange signs and unfamiliar codes.30 27 Ibid., p. 51. 28 Ibid., p. 54. 29 Ibid. 30 Ibid., p. 53.</page><page sequence="11">THE LOST CAUSE OF POETRY 55 Schulz's placement of Drohobycz as the center of these stories, moreover, is never made explicit; rather this both is and is not the Drohobycz of Schulz's childhood just as the narrator and father figure both are and are not Schulz himself and his father. The author never dates the setting of his stories—although good guesses are easily made—and the rendering of truth and fiction is constantly blurred. We may well guess from historical documents, for instance, that Schulz's father was eccentric and slightly fanatical, but it would be difficult to believe that he transformed into a cockroach, as he does in one of Sklepy cynamonowe's later stories. Schulz, however, portrays each with equal solemnity and, one might say, a realist's touch. In doing this, he allows these stories to transcend his experience of Drohobycz in the early 20th Century and attain a sense of timelessness whereby the narrator of "Traktat o manekinach" is more than simply an avatar for Schulz—he is a mythic figure. Ever aware of the power of the written word, Bruno Schulz claimed that Sklepy cynamonowe was "a certain recipe for reality" and that art ought to be "a probe sunk into the nameless."31 In this nameless reality, persons, places, and things take the appearance of the familiar but underneath reveal what is truly essential. One of the most remarkable aspects of Schulz's prose is its ineffability; in both content and form, its fantastic turns of phrase and eloquent propositions require many re-readings. In its multifariousness, it lends itself to almost any reading the reader should allow herself, but with one catch: Never will any one reading be complete. Although I have attempted to show here that Schulz's internar Jewish identity is a very real aspect of Sklepy cynamonowe and "Traktat о manekinach" in particular, it would be misleading to suggest that this background is the driving force of Schulz's work. Rather a blending of readings is in order, as is a willingness to suspend surety of any kind. This, it seems to me is "the lost cause of poetry" and mirrors the strange ecosystems Schulz's Heresiarch describes. Like the "pseudofauna" and "pseudoflora," Schulz's work lives and grows of its own devising and beyond its practical application. These stories succeed in reflecting and challenging their historical context at the same time they resist this application by declaring timelessness. Such statements can be ambiguous at best, and volatile at worst. Even Schulz's Heresiarch notes that "[o]ur creatures will not be heroes of romances in many volumes."32 Still, I take great pleasure in saying that they are in this one. 31 Ibid., 113 32 Ibid., p. 61</page></plain_text>
