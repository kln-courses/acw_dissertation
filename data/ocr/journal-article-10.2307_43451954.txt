<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two for the Rude by Harlan Jacobson Where other cultures have feared an- gry gods, or the British, or devils, or the unconscious, or bugs, or germs, or unto- ward sexual urges, or the lack of them, the American nightmare - besides Communism and women - seems in the summer of 1984 to be malevolent kitchen appliances. There was a time not so long ago when a fish that loused up two weeks out of the tourist season at the Cape was evil enough, though even film critics knew that shark would end up grilled on a spit and in the food chain. What is one to make, then, out of a film in which the central instrument of torture, the worst fate that can befall man (actually woman), the device by which unimaginable horror is visited upon prime, blonde flesh, turns out to be a gigantic french fryer? That's the centerpiece of Indiana Jones and the Tem- ple of Doom, and the fear that it draws upon is inescapable: If you get caught by the people who normally take your order at Burger King - and on their turf - why they are just going to stick you into a basket and lower you into the fat, snicker-snack. The quarreling masses of the world are ready to drop their spats in a flash for prospects of an eat-in kitchen with a reconditioned 1948 Kelvinator in the corner. Thus, your average Kashmiri mountainyerd is simply going to flip when he sees that Sigourney Weaver's NASA-designed refrigerator in Ghost- busters contains terror dogs, not hot ones. "You don't usually see that in a refrigerator," Bill Murray acknowledges in what truly is the summer's most enter- taining film. And, of course, Gremlins, which is truly not, takes a similar view of all the countertop gizmos (sic), stepping back first to satirize them (exploding juice squeezers) before proceeding on to utilize them to stage attacks on the lubri- cious gremlins and dumbfounded audi- ence alike. When George Lucas made our wash- ing machines fly in Star Wars, somehow it was in service not simply to our eyes and imaginations, but to the defense es- tablishment and the salesman in us all. We viewed his films less as Sousa marches (which they were) and more as holiday clearance-sale commercials for every Third World plenipotentiary sit- ting on checkbook balances swollen with our oil dollars. Now, this summer, Hollywood has taken us back into the kitchen and turned General Electric (more likely Sanyo) against us. Progress is obviously not our most important product. Mess is. The old ladies of paranoia are right: Electricity is leaking from our outlets. Why else would our machines be trying to get us? (Woody Allen had this ques- tion down years ago. The story goes something like: Guy gets into the eleva- tor, presses 'Main,' and starts descend- 49</page><page sequence="2">ing. Then the elevator stops. Between floors. Won't move. At wiťs end, the guy cries, "What have I done to deserve this?", and the elevator answers "You the guy on Seven slapping the TV set?") • There is no use parsing Joe Dante's Gremlins for signs of seriousness. To enumerate film references - Capra (It's A Wonderful Life), or Ridley Scott (Alien), or Wizard of Oz , or whichever Invasion of the Body Snatchers you prefer - is to miss the point. Dante in the clutches of Steven Spielberg is less the director who made Piranha or The Howl- ing than he is a young director in thrall to Robert Altman. Wild differences exist in technique, plotting, pacing, characterization, you name it, perhaps even off-set tempera- ment, but they share one characteristic: contempt for the unwashed Middle. Where Altman exploded in his parabola is debatable, since he was so wobbly in his separate concepts, but the dividing line always appeared drawn at 3 Women in 1977. Aside from his having a dream be reason enough to freight the notion of the interchangeability of personality, or of women, the essential audience hook was that film's invitation to laugh at Shelley Duvall squirt cheese out of a can onto a cracker as an hors d'oeuvre. After that, Altman's invitations to A Wedding or Health , laced with his own hysteria and the pandering of Blake Edwards, held the same message: Come on in and laugh at the booboisie - who ultimately had the illiterate grace to stay away. In Gremlins , Dante is up to the same condescension, but from no particular height. The little devils he unleashes on Kingston Falls are his instruments of sat- ire, aping American consumer culture but without the verve of George Ro- mero, who in Dawn of the Dead sent hordes of lumbering zombies careering through a Pittsburgh shopping mall and had the wit and courage of his convic- tions: Just shoot em. Bam-bam-bam. They're dead, anyway. Gremlins is an elaborate ambush of the audience for its own stupidity, and Dante's excuse is the Johnny Carson guest comic's alibi for knocking over easy targets: we gotta laugh at ourselves (or more exactly, ev- erybody else but). In Gremlins' opening sequences, backfire inventor Hoyt Axton stumbles across a critter (measured and built to fit onto Toys-R-Us shelves this Christmas) in a Chinatown junkshop run by the Chinese Sage and brings it home for his kid. It is a set-up for an ending that has "Spielberg" written all over it. The plot, as plots do, simply gets us to the "fun" middle, the part that Dante obviously relished - trashing a small town that dif- fers from its Capra antecedent by conve- niently housing nearly every recogniz- able 1984 American stereotype. The gremlins are unusual in their ability to dress instantly like a cross-sec- tion of American lowbrows. All the right people get lampooned, meaning white people, WASPS in particular, before Dante inserts a barroom scene set up intentionally à la Star Wars and peopled (or puppeted) with a gang of Afro-Amer- ican gremlins in full ghetto garb and riot- ously drunk. That the black skin of the gremlins suddenly seems black is a prob- lem that Dante tried solving by context - nobody in this room is gonna get out unscathed. We even get a dumb prep- pies joke, to be democratic, if unmind- ful of every role Ali MacGraw ever played. Here, Phoebe Cates has to mouth the limp "How Dad Died in the Chimney on Christmas" joke by screen- writer Chris Columbus (you'd think he discovered America), though it stops the furious rhythm of the picture - clunk - which Dante must reestablish in order to get on with the main business of deliver- ing the audience to its Little Big Horn. Just in case the crowd heretofore missed the whiff of ambush, Dante at last turns the jape on the audience. The screen becomes a mirror. The offending gremlins sit in a movie theater looking at you, looking at them (ostensibly looking at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). The straight-on shot is Dante's j'accuse : This is what you bozos out there look like - downright goofy. Tricked ya'! You thought this movie was about everybody else in America. Ha! You clods will buy, and wear, and do the stupidest, most humiliating things. Look at your- selves, you dopes (this means you). All except. . . The Chinese Sage. Never mind that Chinatown in the opening sequences is the smoky gateway to God knows what - consumer items, not to mention ideas, you can't find at a shopping mall. The Chinese Sage tends a soft, loving little anthropomorphic that, if permitted into your world, will multiply like wild- fire - given that you cannot keep some rather kiddie-like rules about their care and upbringing. The film could get by at this level, notwithstanding its intent to savage consumer culture, if The Chi- nese Sage didn't dramatically reappear at the film's ending to become more than a plot conceit, but a scold (and from Southern California, to boot). The Chinese Sage is upset about the typical American family's mad lust for tschochkes at the expense of Nature. He is for Nature. This little cross be- tween Kahlil Gibran and a Confuscius- Say speech - occuring at the end of a Koyaanisqatsi cartoon denunciation of American consumer habits - just about knocks the gong off the top of this old carny's chutzpah scale. How is it that Hollywood filmmakers feel they can lure the public into a movie theater with the help of Madison Avenue to pay up five bucks to watch a bunch of puppets made out of alligator Gucci bags insult them for their lowbrow tastes, and then berate them for not being in touch with Nature? Particularly, when, Steven Spielberg and his confreres own half of Nature? Gremlins has been labeled malicious and mean-spirited for its violence, largely at the hands of the aforemen- tioned kitchen appliances and a mad housewife. Actually, throwing a gremlin into the Cuisinart and bursting one apart in a microwave oven were not bad risks to take, if redundant, but Dante pulled them off efficaciously. It's not clear to me why Maurice Sendak and the Brothers Grimm are allowed to activate the dark impulses of our children and Joe Dante isn't permitted to try without being lambasted for child torture. ("Yah, it's OK. Shows der kiddies dot mommy kin knock der sox off hopgoblins." - Bruno Bettelheim.) The visual and sa- tirical thrust of Gremlins is manifestly mean-spirited in the tradition of Robert Altman, but made worse here because Gremlins' patrons, like Custer's men, thought they were invited to dinner, not for it. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom would have played better had it been an adventure film and not an episode of Father Knows Best in which we finally see what Daddy does for a living. In that sense, the picture descends in a line less from Raiders of the Lost Ark, its predecessor with which it mostly shares Harrison Ford and not much else, than it does from E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial. That one was a lovely, wan lament for the Cincinnati, or Phoenix, or wherever of the Fifties, capped by a wish for all the daddies who've left home to return and to recognize and love magic. Indi- ana Jones is a continuation of Spielberg's dream of restoring Dad to 50</page><page sequence="3">hero and head of household status, though by now the romantic conceit is starting to pale. The building blocks of Indiana Jones are unexamined, throwback notions of men, women, family, and outsiders, which derail the roller-coaster ride that this film was intended as. Spielberg uses bits he's seen in movies like GungaDin that work for him without thinking or playing with the ideas beneath them. The problem is not that villainous Asians, or Marlboro men, or dumb broads shouldn't show up in a movie (a kind of cultural fascism results from that line of thought), but the ones who show up here lack any shading or di- mension, and so their atavism is all that one notices. Any adventure film worth its salt should break a few rules - either of the genre or of the bubble you live in - and Indiana Jones breaks none. One wonders how Indiana Jones might play either in India or Indianap- olis. Americans working out their ro- mantic fantasies on the body of some supine Eastern nation is an accepted genre, so much so even the victims may have internalized the conventions. Last year it was The Year of Living Danger- ously ' when the film shifted focus from its careful unlayering of the heart of the Philippines to the end-drama of whether the white boy will get the white girl and get out. This year it's In- diana Jones , which has considerably less on its mind than Dangerously, and staggeringly less than the magnificent John Huston workup of The Man Who Would Be King. Spielberg means Jones to entertain, I think, and not much more. But when in Bombay, the house- lights dim and the image of a fat Indian hiding in the drapes comes lunging forth with a rope, do they shriek or cheer? And in Indianapolis - forget about the half dozen Indians - when Kate Capshaw as Willie is so unremit- tingly maladroit as to be unable to stay on the back of an elephant (the only one here possessed of either a sense of dignity or humor), again do the locals shriek or cheer? Capshaw does ditsy all right, but that's the problem. Having whizzed from an opening nightclub sequence (where in the middle of bedlam she's grousing about a cracked nail), through a four-story escape into a careening car chase, then to a plane abandoned by its Chinese crew which necessitates an aerial plunge via liferaft onto a Hima- layan bobsled that runs off a cliff into a rapids ("I hate the water, I hate being wet and I hate you," whines Capshaw) and finally comes to rest in an impover- ished Indian village, Spielberg now sets in motion Jones ' ostensible mission. At the behest of a wizened village guru (why did he look like Yoda?), Jones will enter the Pankot Palace and retrieve the stolen, sacred Whatzit stone that permitted the village to flourish. The real mission, however, is not manifest till Capshaw meets the elephant and the elephant wins. Jones must not only battle the local regency, he must make Capshaw into a Woman. And one that can keep up with a man's Man. While the advantage of a sequel is in not having to establish character, Ford here is less sympathetic, starting with the film's breakneck opening in the Club Obi-Wan (enough already). He just looks like another lounge lizard. Raiders worked, even if only superfi- cially, because Indiana Jones was an ar- chaeology prof - in the same way Clark Kent was a reporter. Beneath them specs are pecs. That was the original marketing beauty of Jones as a charac- ter: not only does he fulfill the fantasies of the deskbound middle class, but his bush character and costume is essen- tially a capitulation to blue collar no- tions of masculinity, or at least it was until blue collars started getting in on the sensitivity boom. T. his M his is doubly underscored when Capshaw, Ford, and Ford's protégé, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), are met at the palace door by a too slick Mola Ram, who comes across like a social di- rector at a third-rate Miami Beach resort hotel. He oozes over Capshaw, she melts, and Ford grumbles. We know evil when we see it, and the message is loud and clear: The American Slob is the real man. Lacks a few social graces and is a stranger to soap, but he's virile, kind to kids, and a savior of villages (thank you, World War II). Mining the East as grounds for fan- tasy is a welcome change from the sci-fi sets of the past decade, particularly since it's the cheapest ticket available to Sri Lanka, where exteriors were shot. But while the Star Wars-Outland - Blade Runner films share some kind of vision of the future of the West, Indiana Jones' return to vanquish India in the Thirties comes close to a latent wish for American gunboat diplomacy. This is, after all, a film about an American tough guy settling somebody else's fight - one in which the thugs are Re- publicans, to say the least. Think Indiana Jones isn't about the American way of life, circa Eisenho- wer? There they are in the Temple of Doom. Down below is the scene of Thuggi sacrifice by french frying. Indi- ana Jones has to go to work and get the stone. "You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory," Willie nags. "Maybe, but not today," he says, and gives her a kiss. Was that not the substance of conversation at the door of every house in 1957 Levittown at 8:05 a.m., or what? We've been set up for this typical breadwinner deal earlier. She's an ur- ban baby ("The place is crawling with things"), he's cool and competent ("That's why they call it the jungle, sweetheart") in a slapstick scene of na- ture run amuck that is followed by en- try into the Pankot Palace. When at last we reach the bedroom scene - which has a Fortunoffs/Long Island branch look to it - they're not only sexually clutzy, but at the first opportunity he's back to work. Rubbing the breasts of the bedpost statue (an act Willie finds beyond herself), he's down the secret passageway (!) and off in hot pursuit - only to become trapped in a dungeon that bares menacing teeth and collapses around its victims (Is there no one on staff here who took Psych 101?). Pre- dictably, Willie comes - ugh! - to the rescue, but there's no surprise. It's tired filmmaking, which Spielberg tried to mitigate with a bit of going-back-to- square-one business, and then going back for the hat. On the surface, the hook to Indiana Jones appears to be its momentum, which is actually herky-jerky instead of accelerative, but sub-surface lies a rec- ognizable Spielberg wish to reunite the fractured family. Granted, there are critics who think Woody Allen is adapt- ing Thomas Mann, but it is difficult to look at Indiana Jones and not see an im- age of the era of divorce. That Jones is not himself due to a wicked potion he is forced to drink, that Willie implores, "Please come back to us. You're not one of them," and that Jones is rescued and reunited with Willie by the kid, is per- haps ignorable. But at the point that Jones screams, "Wake up, Willie it's me. I'm back," the subtext just starts crowding out the adventure. Oh, we do get a This is Cinerama (1952, by the way) finale, but it leads beyond the liberation of village children to a long shot of a happy Indiana, Short Round and Willie. Together, God bless 'em. 51</page></plain_text>
