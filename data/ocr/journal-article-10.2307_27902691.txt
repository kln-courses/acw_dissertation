<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION1 Evolutionary theory is a tempting field for non-biologists, partly, I sup pose, because it seems to impinge on such large questions about human and/or animal nature, "the meaning of life" and such, and for philosophers because of its tantalizing conceptual structure. Darwinian evolutionary theory in particular?the orthodoxy of the present and recurrently the most prestigious theory on and off throughout the past century?Darwinian evolutionary theory seems both remarkably simple and persistent in its basic principles, and yet remarkably flexible, not to say ambiguous, in some of its fundamental concepts. Accuse it of determinism, it turns (or seems to turn) teleological, accuse it of basing a most improbable history on chance, it tells of selection's creative powers, creative in the full sense, like a composer or a poet.2 But accuse it of anthropomorphism, it turns hard-nosed and deter ministic or even "merely" statistical. What material could be better suited to what my colleagues in Leeds used to call "concept-cracking"? Here, however, it is not those often synchronie ambiguities that will con cern us. It is rather a question of diachronic pluralities. My question here is: how does modern evolutionary theory in its standard version, sometimes cal led the synthetic theory, relate to Darwinism in its original form?21 want to put this question both as a problem of conceptual analysis and as a way to consider, through a case study, the nature of change?or stability?in scien tific theories. First, very briefly, we should recall the central structure of Darwin's theory. Let me quote a statement by Richard C. Lewontin, and explicate it, with some modification, to fit it more closely to what I find to be Darwin's argument. Lewontin writes: As seen by present-day evolutionists, Darwin's scheme embodies three principles: 1. Different individuals in a population have different morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors (phenotypic variation). 2. Different phenotypes have different rates of survival and reproduction in different environments (differential fitness). 3. There is a correlation between parents and offspring in the contribution of each to future generations (fitness is heritable). These three principles embody the principle of evolution by natural selection. While they hold, a population will undergo evolutionary change.3</page><page sequence="2">196 MARJORIE GRENE That sounds fine; but the trouble is: we're presented with three principles? independent axioms? Scarcely. (2) depends on (1) and on the existence of reproduction and of differing environments; principle (3) in turn depends on (2) and on the principle of heritability. In short, we have here not so much a set of principles as a very general argument about what happens to popula tions under certain conditions.4 Now let me turn back to compare Lewontin's argument with Darwin's in the first few chapters of the Origin.5 First, sure enough, there is Phenotypic Variation in Chapters One and Two: variation under domestication and variation in nature. Chapter Three finds that a "struggle for existence" follows necessarily from the facts of variation and population increase. Note: "struggle" here is used, not literally, but in the sense that, in differing environments, organisms exhibiting certain variants whether of morphology, physiology, or behavior, are slightly better suited for existence and especially reproduction than are others with slightly different variants of these characters. This is in effect Lewontin's Principle 2: Differential Fitness. Three new principles have been introduced here, however: reproduction, population increase and differing environment. Darwin of course got the idea of population increase from Malthus; he said so. Yet that idea, with its attendant notion of limited resources, is in fact un necessary. Reproduction will suffice.6 But the relation to environment, which is made explicit as a separate principle by neither Lewontin nor Darwin, is in deed essential. Variation + Reproduction + Differing Environments ?&gt; Dif ferential Fitness. That's the first step, which takes us to the second principle, Darwin's Struggle for Existence, Lewontin's Differential Fitness. For the se cond step, to the third principle, we need to take account of another fact characteristic of the natural world: the fact that organisms, parts of organisms, or groups of organisms resemble their parents or parts or groups of same. As I shall emphasize in a moment, the mechanism of heredity is ir relevant to this argument (as is the size of the unit involved), but heredity by some means is a fact necessarily presupposed here. Given Differential Fitness and Heredity, then what follows is the Differential Fitness of offspring that have inherited the varying adaptations of their parents?and that is, by definition, Natural Selection. So: given Phenotypic Variation, Differing En vironments, Reproduction and Heredity, Natural Selection necessarily fol lows. And who could deny the obvious facts about the natural world from which this consequence flows? It is this deductive argument, from variation, differing environments, reproduction (for Darwin, Malthusian increase), and heredity, to Natural Selection as their consequence: it is this argument that carries the chief ex planatory power of Darwinian theory. And, if we substitute the more general</page><page sequence="3">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 197 'reproduction' for Malthusian increase the theory remains unchanged and in effect unchallenged. Darwin's ignorance of the laws of genetics was a gap that vexed him. So far as the argument of the Origin goes, it was a gap, not a mis take. As Lewontin points out, Darwin's theory was completely general, with no implications one way or another for genetics?or for that matter, biochemistry.7 Any entities that vary, reproduce and pass on characters to another generation can undergo Natural Selection; if environments change, they do undergo it. That's Darwin's theory. It doesn't include any theory about the invisible parts of organisms, whether germ cells or macromolecules, or about the relations of cells or macromolecules to the development of whole plants or animals. Darwin's own speculations about such matters were unsuccessful; that simply doesn't affect the structure of the theory of Natural Selection. Indeed, since Darwin's time Natural Selection has so often been observed to happen both in the laboratory and in the wild? think of the familiar story of the increased resistance of pests to insecticides, for instance?that it may well be taken, as Lewontin has elsewhere taken it, for no theory at all, but just a description.8 That's why, William Wimsatt has suggested, the dramatization of Darwin's argument through the invocation of Malthusian increase can be dropped.9 Natural Selection is so obviously seen to be going on, in industrial melanism, color polymorphism, etc., etc., etc., that it doesn't take a population explosion to display it. Maybe so; but I believe the deductive structure of Darwin's argument was an important factor in generating and sustaining the vast body of observational, theoretical and experimental work that has since transformed it to a fact. Although there is probably a lesson here for philosophers of science, with respect to the relation between theory and observation, that is not to the point in the present con text. I just want Darwin's own central, deductive argument in the background as we go on to ask what has happened to Darwinism in the twentieth century, in particular in the thirties to fifties with the rise of the so-called synthetic theory. One can distinguish three major moves in this story.10 But before I set these out, I should remove a common misconception (of my own as well as other people's). The synthesis of the thirties is often presented as the recon ciliation of genetics and Darwinism. That is true in a way, but in another way untrue. It is true, of course, that in the first decades of modern genetics geneticists and evolutionists did often confront one another as opposing fac tions within biology, the former as practitioners of a new and relatively exact science, the latter as natural historians subsuming a range of relatively qualitative knowledge under speculative theories about the past. And the dif ference was not only professional; it was conceptual. Genetics based itself on the specification of discrete units of heredity, while Darwinism envisaged a</page><page sequence="4">198 MARJORIE GRENE gradual, continuous sweep of evolutionary change. It is true, further, that the conflict was overcome, at least in part through the statistical treatment of changing gene frequencies in population, which provides continuous models of the discontinuous (if you get lots of samples of small discontinuous changes and graph them, you get lines, which appear continuous). At the same time, this appearance of conceptual conflict was superficial: as we have seen, the theory of Natural Selection simply entails no view at all about the mechanisms of genetics. Darwin worried about the possible effects of blending inheritance. He need not have worried; inheritance is Mendelian. But possible difficulties about one kind of inheritance or another do not affect his actual theses, which, again, are completely general to varying, reproduc ing, inheriting entities?however they do it. What happened, then, was not strictly a synthesis of Darwinism with Mendelism, since neither theory needed to be modified to fit the other. What happened, I believe, was both simpler and more complicated. There are, as I said, three major moves, more or less contemporary (it is a question of sorting out Leitmotive, not of a temporal sequence). And again, the first ma jor step was not so much a modification of two mutually contradictory theories, genetics and evolutionary theory, as it was a building in of genetics as the firm foundation for evolution. Again, it was not that the theory of natural selection had to be adjusted to Mendelism and in turn Mendelism ad justed to evolutionary theory. Mendelian genetics provided the foundation in the laws of heredity that Darwinism had formerly lacked. Second, since genetics was being used to found and thus solidify Darwinian evolutionary theory, other fashions in evolutionary thinking were thereby, with due atten tion by the synthesizers, removed, for the time at least, from serious con sideration by evolutionists; evolution became firmly Darwinian. And third, other biological disciplines, notably taxonomy and paleontology, also embryology and botany (if you want to count the latter as a special branch of biology) were once more drawn into the new genetic-Darwinian fold. Indeed, in this sense, Darwin's own theory had been itself "synthetic," so that the new theory in this respect, too, represents a restoration rather than a reform of the Darwinian perspective. We have, then, three dimensions to the establishment of the "new synthesis": (1) what one might call the geneticization of Darwinism, (2) the conquest of evolutionary heresies, and (3) the harmoniz ing of the now thoroughly Darwinian evolutionary theory with other special disciplines within biology. Let's consider each of these in turn. First, how was the new genetics worked into the theory of evolution? Here there are also three major features of the process: (1) conceptualization, (2) experimentation and (3) mathematization, especially the application of statistical techniques. I want to illustrate the first two by reference to work in</page><page sequence="5">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 199 the twenties, not by one of the acknowledged founders of the synthesis, Fisher, Haldane and Wright, but by a less frequently cited naturalist and geneticist, S. S. Chetverikov. His 1926 paper "On Certain Aspects of the Evolutionary Process from the Standpoint of Modern Genetics" was published in translation, with an introduction by I. M. Lerner, in 1961.11 Dobzhansky had also published excerpts from it as an appendix to his Cold Spring Harbor Symposium paper in 1959, the year of Chetverikov's death as well as of the Darwin centennial.12 Against a background of long-since ex tinct controversy (about whether mutations occur at all in nature), it presents succinctly, it seems to me, one version at least of twentieth-century Darwi nian thinking, even foreshadowing the outcome of some controversies that have raged through the intervening half-century. So even if it was not the first statement of the theory, we may take it as an example of its relatively early formulation. Darwin's theory, we have seen, depended on acknowledging the presence in nature of large numbers of small variations. But, lacking a knowledge of genetics, Darwin seems to have been troubled by the presumed "swamping" of new variations in crossing. Now, Chetverikov pointed out, the work of Hardy and Pearson had provided principles to correct this troubling impression. Hardy's law, as Chetverikov called it, gives us the principle that with free crossing genetic factors remain in equilibrium13 and an insight of Pearson's which Chetverikov calls "the law of stabilizing cros sing" shows us how equilibrium is reestablished after some external factor has disturbed it. "Thus," he writes, "the apparatus which stabilizes the fre quencies of the components of a given population lies in the very mechanism of free crossing. Any change of the ratio of these frequencies is possible only by action from without and is possible only so long as the external force which disturbs the equilibrium is active."14 We may conclude, therefore, he says, that "a species, like a sponge, soaks up heterozygous mutations, while remaining (let's amdnd this to "even while remaining?we shall see why shortly) [even] while remaining from first to last externally (phenotypically) homogeneous."15 There you have it: modern genetics demonstrates how Darwinian evolution works. No more threat by swamping effects, no more resorting to Lamarckism. Thanks to theoretical genetics, the fundamental principles of Darwinism receive firm conceptual support. So let us see how our fundamental argument works now. There is phenotypic variation; well and good. But underlying it is a vast fund of heterozygosity, genotypic variation, which, in changing environmental cir cumstances, can mediate the new phenotypic variants needed to produce Dif ferential Fitness. And such genotypic variations, being Mendelian, segregate, so that they can be selected, while the now less fit variants wither away.</page><page sequence="6">200 MARJORIE GRENE Natural Selection is still the very same process. Now, however, it's carried by a clearly apprehended genetic mechanism. Concealed heterozygotes, carried forward by Mendelian heredity, proliferate when circumstances favor them? and again new variations are always hiding in the population's gene pool ready to multiply when once more circumstances change. True, at first sight this may not look exactly Darwinian, because it's not Phenotypic Variation but Phenotypic Homogeneity that Chetverikov emphasizes. We have Phenotypic Uniformity, Genetic Variation, then with Differing Environ ments (and Reproduction), Differential Fitness, and with the Heritability of Differential Fitness, Natural Selection. So the first principle looks rather dif ferent. The point is, though, that there is always variability, even with phenotypic uniformity, and a fortiori when phenotypes too vary. Indeed, as we'll see shortly, the existence of variability at the level of the gene is demonstrated through breeding experiments in which phenotypic variation is used to prove the existence of previously hidden genetic diversity. William Provine makes the point that the variations Chetverikov actually worked with were grosser and rarer than the minute differences dear to strict Darwinians;161 venture to suggest, however, that in its outlines Chetverikov's basic reasoning is analogous to that of many of the "synthesizers." The point is that the argument we have elicited from Lewontin and Darwin can now be supported by reference to an intelligible genetic mechanism. Moreover, the use of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as a base for the genetic account shows clearly that Darwinian evolution is, if indirectly, a function of differing en vironments. In a single stable environment, populations are likely to be stable; with differing environments comes evolution, or, if there doesn't hap pen to be enough variation available, extinction. Further, it is clear that this is not Lamarckian internal striving. Environment does not induce change in liv ing things by direct influence (as Darwin sometimes thought and as many still believed until fairly recently), nor is it the "efforts" of plants and animals to adjust their properties to new circumstances that induces evolutionary change. Environment is the agent of change, but indirectly, through stimulating a disequilibrium which then, through stabilizing selection, settles into a renewed equilibrium with different components. A few years ago, when Kenneth Schaffner was investigating the discovery of the lac operon, he learned from Lederberg that one of the moves in this history had been Lederberg's effort to find an internal mechanism to explain the behavior of the molecules in question?since, he reasoned, nothing Darwinian can evolve through outside influence.171 was puzzled by this report until I realized that Lederberg must have been thinking of Darwinism in its anti-Lamarckian aspect: nothing is generated by direct organism-environment adaptation. But. Darwinism rests just as firmly on an anti-internal principle: nothing is</page><page sequence="7">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 201 generated by the organism's trying to adapt. There is no inner drive to change. There are indefinitely many small instructional variants that just happen to be lying about and that multiply if circumstances make it likelier that they should do so. As Sewall Wright has pointed out, this is not an ac count halfway between indeterminism and determinism, but an account uni quely compounded of random and deterministic factors:18 random mutations, i.e., materials varying without reference to the organism's needs, and chang ing probabilities of survival of these varying materials from one generation to the next, depending on environmental conditions. That is what Darwinism is about; and in essence, it is expressed in Chetverikov's paper. Two more brief remarks about Chetverikov and the conceptual founda tion of neo-Darwinism before I go on to the experimental and statistical aspects of the "synthesis." First: although I cannot try to deal here with more recent controversy, I must just mention briefly how Chetverikov's paper an ticipates the solution of some of these debates. Take, e.g., the contrast between the balance theory, which stresses heterozygosity, and the classical theory of Muller and his school, which insists on very precise adaptation, presumably backed up chiefly by homozygotes.19 The issue of this debate is clearly anticipated in the statement from Chetverikov that I quoted. And his experimental work, as we shall see, tended in the same direction. Or, to take a second example: both the neutral mutation school, which derived indirectly from Muller, and the reply to it, are anticipated in Chetverikov's argument.20 Of course all mutations are "random" with respect to the needs of the organism in which they occur, but the processes of environment-organism in teraction that constitute the conditions for natural selection, and the resultant inheritance of differential fitness, are by no means random. Mutation is neutral but evolution, in the long run, is selective. Moreover?a third case? the thesis that it is the isolation of small subpopulations that usually provokes speciation, which Eldredge and Gould place at the basis of their theory of punctuated equilibria,21 is also stressed in the latter part of Chetverikov's es say.22 Again, the importance of isolation as an evolutionary factor used to be much debated23?while inter-group selection, which seems to suit well with Chetverikov's analysis, is still a controversial subject.24 Second, another brief excursus: it should be added that biochemistry has not only furnished another fundamental level to Darwinian thinking, it has returned the starting point of evolutionary thinking more directly to phenotypic variation. The techniques of electrophoresis have permitted the study of mutation and selection by focusing on the differential production of proteins?but these belong to the phenotype. So instead of looking at gross phenotypic variations only, one can see phenotypic variation directly?or almost directly?at the minutest level. For a few years evolutionists were</page><page sequence="8">202 MARJORIE GRENE alarmed by the rise of biochemistry, fearing the demise of their molar science, and both Dobzhansky and Simpson published articles in response to this frightening prospect.25 But by now it is quite clear that biochemistry has im mensely strengthened the empirical foundation of Darwinian evolutionary theory, again without the slightest change in its conceptual structure.26 So much for the reconceptualization of Darwinism in modern, Mendelian terms. The experimental confirmation of Darwin's reasoning in the past half-century has been much too immense and much too intricate in its inner controversies for a layman to try to summarize in a few paragraphs. Let me once more take Chetverikov as representative for this story and quote from Lerner's introduction to the article we have been look ing at. Here he is reporting the experimental work presented by Chetverikov at the Fifth International Congress in Berlin in 1927. Lerner writes: His experimental technique is, of course, today a commonplace one, but in 1926 it was a trailblazing undertaking. Having concluded that the apparent phenotypic uniformity of many populations must conceal behind it a great amount of genetic variability, Chetverikov trapped 239 wild Drosophila melanogaster females and proceeded to examine the offspring of their immediate progeny, mated brother X sister. As many as 32 different segregating loci were found in this small popula tion, giving rise to future work of this kind on many species by a great number of investigators. One need only refer to Dobzhansky's Genetics and the Origin of Species, or to the Symposia of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory dedicated to evolutionary topics (1955?1959) to appreciate the far-reaching growth of ex perimental population genetics since the modest beginning of Chetverikov's experiment.27 Not that the major influence was Chetverikov's; by no means. But this is one of the small beginnings of an experimental technique that was to embody a whole science: population genetics. And what I want to stress here, of course, is that such work by no means contradicted Darwin's reasoning, but beautifully confirmed it. The third part of my first point, too, could have been suggested by Chetverikov's paper, i.e., the , application of statistical techniques to evolutionary theory and genetic experiment. For, as we have seen, he takes Hardy's and Pearson's statistical formulations to guide him in his reasoning. The ingenious statistical reasoning of the three official founders of the new Darwinian theory, however, goes far beyond Chetverikov's beginnings. If you look at Wright's papers of the early thirties, for example, you see how delicate, varied and promising for future research and speculation the population-genetical approach to evolutionary thinking turned out to be.28 Fisher in 1930, perhaps because he was a mathematician rather than a biologist, is much more extravagant than Wright in his speculative claims.29 But Wright's graph of selective peaks and valleys in his 1932 paper offered</page><page sequence="9">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 203 conceptual X visual tools clearly essential to the now classic magnum opus of Dobzhansky, Genetics and the Origin of Species, first published in 1937.30 So, once more, the basic structure of Darwinian theory appears to be vindicated?rather than modified?through its Mendelized conceptualiza tion, through the experimental work of population geneticists, and through the use of increasingly powerful statistical methods in presenting both theoretical reasoning and experimental results. As I see it, that's the first ma jor step in the genesis of the synthetic theory. The second step was the defeat of alternative evolutionary theories by neo-Darwinism. Up to this time, even into the forties, there had not only been a rivalry between genetics, under the guidance of workers like Bateson, and the surviving evolutionists,31 there had also been a proliferation of divergent evolutionary views. Convincing though Darwin's basic argument is, after all, it carries with it also a number of serious difficulties, some of which Darwin himself had recognized. The occurrence of natural selection follows, as we have seen, from a few observable facts, so readily that by now it has itself come to be taken as a fact. Yet is also contradicts what seemed to many scientists equally incontrovertible "facts." Darwinsim depends on the con tinuous accumulation of slight random variations in adaptation to changing environments. All three features of this story, however, were subjected to doubt in one context or another. As Darwin himself noted in the Origin, the gaps in the fossil record suggest a pattern other than the slow and stately progress of phyletic gradualism; and there have been paleontologists who responded to this situation by presenting a "saltationist" theory of evolutionary change.32 Others, like the great American paleontologist H. F. Osborn, found by their time enough of the gaps brilliantly filled in to over come Darwin's difficulty, but doubted that random changes could produce the "rectigradations," as Osborn called them, that they saw in major paleon tological sequences. The development of the titanotheres, for example, looked too elegantly directive to be initially due to "chance." Terms like " orthogenesis" or "aristogenesis" were needed to designate such grand spec tacles.33 Still others doubted that all major changes could fit under the heading "adaptive." Thus as late as 1936, for instance, the President of the Geological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science presented a view of "racial life and death" as characteristic of life's history on this planet.34 He told the familiar story of Gryphaea, the story (since thoroughly discredited)35 of the oyster that allegedly secreted so much limestone, it had no room to live in its shell and so perished?out of the same kind of ossification that befalls us all in our old age. Natural Selection, it seemed, would not have permitted such clearly non-adaptive, even mal adaptive, happenings; so it couldn't be the universal explanation Darwinians</page><page sequence="10">204 MARJORIE GRENE would like to think it. Even in the nineteen fifties, indeed, there were paleon tologists not yet convinced of the efficacy of selection to explain the nature of paleontological change.36 In systematics, too, there were doubters, like Robson and Richards, of whom I'll speak later.37 And indeed, even Sewall Wright, one of the acknowledged founders of the new theory, declared in his much-cited 1932 paper that "the principal evolutionary mechanism in the origin of species must be a non-adaptive one."38 Moreover, there was a dis tinguished geneticist, Richard Goldschmidt, who in his Silliman lectures of 1939 (published in 1940 under the title The Material Basis of Evolution)39 put forward an alternative theory of what he called systemic mutations. While Darwinism seeks a monolithic explanation for all evolutionary phenomena, Goldschmidt argued, his "more plausible" theory distinguished the (Darwinian) causes of microevolution?the origin of varieties within species? from macroevolution, the origin of species itself. As has often been pointed out, it is chiefly the origin of varieties Darwin talks about, and then one is supposed to extrapolate to the origin of species. But is nature really like that? It is true that with each natural form there can be and often is a proliferation of subgroups differing slightly from one another and adapted to somewhat different local environments. Such groups, however, belong biologically to one species; species in turn are separated from one another, not by such small distinctions, but by what Goldschmidt liked to call a "bridgeless gap." Goldschmidt's arguments sometimes seem unclear and sometimes not really as anti-Darwinian as he believed40?but the point is that his views were taken sufficiently seriously to be debated in some detail by the founders of the new synthesis.41 And then there was the unfortunate J. C. Willis, a botanist who had accompanied Sir Francis Darwin on an expedition to India.42 Although he had left home a convinced Darwinian, he soon abandoned his faith. For he found such an overwhelming variety of plants in the same river bed that he could not imagine how natural selection could have produced them. Different forms in the very same ecological niche: it doesn't make selectionist sense! It seemed, rather, just everything bursting out all over. So Willis developed the theory of the hollow curve, as he called it, to explain the multiplication of species. Species are distributed, he argued, like surnames in a phone book (he used a particular Swiss canton as his example). There are a number of very common names in the middle of the curve, and less common ones along both edges. So with natural kinds: the older, better distributed and more monotypic ones have become more common; the new ones, more restricted in range, and more polytypic, are relatively rare. And there is a mathematical "reason" for this! The frequencies, it seems, decline in such a way that a plot of logarithms of number of genera against the number of contained species produces an approach to a straight line. But this form of distribution, Willis</page><page sequence="11">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 205 believed, agrees with what would be expected on the mutation theory and is entirely at odds with expectation in terms of natural selection.43 Such odd theories, as they now appear, or have until very recently appeared, were seriously discussed by the major "synthesizers" in the forties and to some ex tent even later, until at last the genetically reinforced Darwinian view firmly, and for the most part (as it then seemed) fairly, eliminated the rival can didates. In short, debate of this kind formed an important part of the development of the synthetic theory. It was not just a case of strengthening Darwinism with a Mendelian foundation, but of using that strengthened theory to defeat rival views of evolution with its help. Along with this consolidation of Darwinism, third, and interacting with it, came the recognition by leaders in other branches of biology that their dis ciplines in turn could be strengthened by assimilation to geneticized Darwi nian principles. And this is where the "synthetic" aspect of the synthetic theory comes most conspicuously into its own. Thus, Mayr published his Systematics and the Origin of Species in 1942.44 Bernhard Rensch, the chief European representative of the new taxonomy, published his Neuere Probleme der Abstammungslehre in 1947.45 Huxley had edited a collection called The New Systematics in 1940.46 In paleontology, G. G. Simpson was the leading spokesman for the new synthesis, and indeed, I think one can say, its chief creator. His Tempo and Mode in Evolution appeared in 1944,47 and an anthology entitled Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution was edited by Jepsen, Mayr and Simpson in 1949.48 For embryology, the work by Ivan Schmalhausen, to which Dobzhansky wrote the introduction, is the one I have usually seen cited49, although Gavin De Beer's Embryos and Ancestors should certainly be included.50 Stebbins' Variation and Evolution in Plants51 (1950) brought botany explicitly within the new perspective. Huxley's Evolu tion: the Modern Synthesis (1942) should also be mentioned.52 In most of these authoritative works, the competing evolutionary theories are still dis cussed, and one can see vividly biological specialists approaching with dif ficulty yet hope the all-embracing synthesis. It is this process I want to il lustrate, in conclusion, by reference to one example: systematics, and in par ticular to one text, which I have already mentioned, Mayr's Systematics and the Origin of Species.53 The impression an outsider gets in reading it is twofold. First, it seems that taxonomy, founded on principles at first sight un congenial to Darwinian thinking, had been approaching, through its own development, a style of thought compatible with Darwinism. True, taxonomy had provided important material for Darwin himself: it is the subsumption of natural diversity?the differences that taxonomists, including Darwin, take such pains to record?under a principle of continuity that is characteristic of selectionist explanation. Yet the chief occupation of museum taxonomists</page><page sequence="12">206 MARJORIE GRENE had consisted in recording those differences themselves, and they usually did it by tagging certain specimens as "types." Such an occupation, or preoc cupation, can well go with what Mayr and others like to call "typological" thinking. Darwin, however, Mayr alleges, had introduced into biology what he calls, by contrast, "population" thinking. Not some one "type" per species, but a large number of slightly differing individuals is what one now concentrates on. And taxonomy itself, at least in the case of the best known groups, like birds and butterflies, Mayr seems to be saying, had at last been moving in this same direction. The more specimens you collect, after all, the smaller your differences, and the more your classifications come to ap pear compatible with Darwin's stress on Phenotypic Variation, that is, on the existence of large aggregates of slightly differing individuals. (Indeed, as Maurice Mandelbaum has shown, such reasoning had already entered into Lamarck's argument for evolution.)54 Second, it appears that the time had come when taxonomy could strengthen its own foundation by taking its place as one of the disciplines con tributing to a general evolutionary theory. Thoughtful taxonomists are likely to ask themselves how the variations they find in nature, from individual fluc tuations through varieties, subspecies, species all the way to the "higher" taxa, have probably arisen. In general three kinds of answers were possible: a theory of evolution by mutation, favored by Goldschmidt and in part at least by Willis, a theory of natural selection, and a neo-Lamarckian view, sup porting the heritability of induced somatic change.55 Up to the thirties, Mayr, like his German counterpart Bernhard Rensch, had favored a more neo Lamarckian explanation.56 Now, he, like Rensch, had been persuaded that the neo-Darwinian answer was correct. Why? To begin with, the study of minor variation, and especially of geographic variation, seems to favor some explanation in terms of small, gradual change?not macromutation. But then the failure of neo-Lamarckian experiments and observations had combined with the successes of the Drosophila group and the impact of mathematical models in population genetics to support the Darwinian version of the gradualist answer. Thus Mayr concludes the first of two chapters on geographic variation: I have tried, in the preceding discussion, to point out some of the reasons why taxonomists have been reluctant to accept all the conclusions drawn by geneticists. These mental reservations do not mean that an agreement between the two sciences is impossible. On the eontrary, the disagreement concerns minor points, and it is possible to make a number of well-substantiated statements on the genetic basis of species formation without referring to these controversial problems. The following generalizations may be made, on the basis of the study of natural populations and of the analysis of the Fl and F2 hybrids of tax onomically well-established subspecies and species:</page><page sequence="13">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 207 First, there is available in nature an almost unlimited supply of various kinds of mutations. Second, the variability within the smallest taxonomic units has the same genetic basis as the differences between the subspecies, species, and higher categories. And third, selection, random gene loss, and similar factors, together with isolation, make it possible to explain species formation on the basis of mutability, without any recourse to Lamarckian forces.57 And he refers to Dobzhansky's magnum opus as having provided, "in an ad mirable way," "more detailed proof for the validity of these three statements." This seems to be genuine synthesis, genuinely at work.58 Seven teen years later, in his centennial paper at Cold Spring Harbor, Mayr played down somewhat the contribution of the early mathematical geneticists, restricting it to the period of "beanbag genetics,"59 yet via his acknowledged debt to Dobzhansky, this influence seems difficult to ignore. Yet promising though the synthesis appears in this and other fundamen tal texts, some nagging historical-methodological questions remain. A few years before Mayr's work appeared (1936), two English taxonomists, G. C. Robson and O. W. Richards, had published, under the title, The Variation of Animals In Nature, a careful study of the evidence for and against the theory of Natural Selection.60 They take account of the mathematical models of Fisher and Haldane, and to some extent also of Wright, and they present a wide range of data collected by a great many workers in the field and in the laboratory. Throughout, they find some support for Natural Selection, but a great deal of information either indifferent to the theory or seeming to militate against it. In the last analysis, I think, they are uneasy about the apriorism of Darwin's reasoning, and that of his new spiritual descendants. Even mimicry, they argue, while it could have been produced by natural selection, need not have been so. Nobody has seen the very small steps through which, say, Batesian mimicry is supposed to have been established. How can selectionists be so positive that their explanation must be right? And in other, much less likely, cases, too! It would be instructive, I think, to com pare their style of inductive reasoning with Darwin's (in the later chapters of the Origin); but obviously I cannot do that here. I have referred to their work on this occasion because I wonder why the very same data that to them were either neutral or negative could furnish support for neo-Darwinism in the minds of other biologists, including taxonomists. Mayr occasionally refers to their data, but, with no apparent qualms, uses them to confirm his own view. How can this be? If the crucial difference was the appearance of Dobzhansky's book in 1937 (which, however, did not move Goldschmidt), one still wonders what shuffling of premises or novel argumentation it is that persuades scientists to make such moves. And even Dobzhansky seems to have swept under the carpet Wright's remark about the non-adaptive (and</page><page sequence="14">208 MARJORIE GRENE therefore non-Darwinian) character of the origin of species to which I refer red earlier. Not that my readers should take away, after that, a "relativist" or "ir rationalist" message! I am not suggesting that fashion in science moves ab surdly from one darned thing to another, but only that the growth of knowledge is a very subtle and complex process and that in this instance the sketch I have been giving you is only a very simple first approximation to the truth. Two last brief notes. One: I have been looking at some instances of the synthesis in process. By 1953, when Simpson published Major Features of Evolution,61 or 1954, when Hardy, Huxley and Ford presented Evolution as a Process,62 the resulting position had become more self-assured, so much so that it assumed in some cases a more propagandistic tone and indulged in tricks like Simpson's "adaptive types," which of course, unlike the types of typologists, are not really types at all, or his concept of quantum evolution or the lyricism displayed in some quarters about how much "selection can see" because it has so long.63 Yet none of this enthusiasm, I can now see, detracts substantially from the persuasiveness of the fundamental reasoning that I have illustrated by referring you to Chetverikov's paper, or from the merit of the experimental work done in the name of the synthetic theory in a number of fields. In the most recent versions of Mayr's and Dobzhansky's texts, and as I have already mentioned, we have evidence of the further consolidation of the theory through the biochemical revolution: a revolution which, far from replacing the Darwinian vision, has given it a second and even firmer founda tion in biochemical genetics. At the same time, however?and this is my final point?the stability of the synthesis in its mid-twentieth century form may yet be imperilled. In my initial summary of the Darwinian argument, I passed over a presupposition subscribed to by most professed Darwinians, which I have sometimes called "the axiom of adaptivity." By this I mean the belief that most major features of living things are functions of the need to adapt to environmental circum stances, a belief that is so deep-seated it is scarcely ever mentioned, and I did not therefore count it explicitly in the preceding analysis. It is worth noting here, however, that both Stephen Jay Gould and Lewontin himself are now critical of what they call "adaptationism." Gould proposes an alternative that he entitles "structural integration," a view reminiscent of some Euro pean non- or anti-Darwinian theories?although Gould rightly observes that Darwin himself was not so fanatical an adaptationist (and selectionist) as many of his twentieth-century Nachfolger have been. Nor has reliance on the axiom of adaptivity been universal even in neo-Darwinian writers, at least in their early days. In so far as "adaptationism" has become more emphatic and</page><page sequence="15">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF DARWINIAN EVOLUTION 209 universal, however, it may perhaps be taken as characteristic of the "synthesis." Whether, as Gould predicts, the synthesis will "crumble" along with adaptationism remains to be seen.64 In the meantime, in its broad out lines at least, the story I have been telling appears to be one of the great suc cess stories of twentieth-century science, or better of nineteenth century science expanded, confirmed and vindicated in the twentieth. The question, whether and to what extent, after more than a century, recent controversy is due to reverse this apparent triumph, and how the new theoretical structure will seem to be related to the fundamental tenets of Darwin's own thought, must be tabled as belonging, not so much in the context of "the nineteenth century today," as of the twentieth century tomorrow. Marjorie Grene University of California, Davis NOTES 1. I am grateful to Richard Burian, William Provine and Hans Sluga for com menting on an earlier draft of this paper. For such insights as I have to offer I owe a great deal to several Temple Univer sity biologists and to Richard Burian, all of whom joined in a seminar on the general topic at Temple in Spring 1979. At least one important piece of evident, however, is still outstanding. In 1974 Ernst Mayr held two workshops with some of the then sur viving participants in the creation of the synthetic theory, and the proceedings (W. B. Provine and Ernst Mayr, eds., The Evolutionary Synthesis; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, in press) will certainly shed light on this important episode in scien tific history. A more complete account is also projected by William Provine. Mean time, however, a study of a number of the key publications of the period does give, I think, some indication of what happened. At the same time, it must be admitted, many questions about the conceptual structure of the synthetic and/or the original Darwinian theory must be entirely omitted here. 2.

"It is gratifying," he concludes, "that all the disciplines which furnish material for the understanding of evolution?taxonomy and morphology, descriptive and experimental embryology, static and dynamic (physiological) genetics, comparative anatomy and paleontology?supply ample and parallel evidence for a theory of evolution which is more plausible than the neo Darwinian theory," (p. 395). 40. On the first point, see G. L. Stebbins, Variation and Evolution in Plants (New York: Columbia University Press, 1940), p. 194. On the second: neither Goldschmidt's objections to the synthetic theory nor his positive views seem con clusive in defeating the Darwinian position. He argued that according to the neo Darwinian view each gene mutation would have to contribute on its own to the character of the phenotype: as linear in its effect as it is in its location. And he insisted that according to Darwinism every variety must be an incipient species. Single gene mutations, however, he argued, are incapable of producing those "bridgeless gaps" that separate species, and varieties are too closely intergraded to count as incipient species. Therefore some other mechanism than the Darwinian must be added to ex</page><page sequence="18">212 MARJORIE GRENE plain the origin of species and higher groups. Neither of these objections, however, seems valid. On the first: Goldschmidt opposes to single locus mutations what he calls "systemic mutations," where arrangements of whole chromosomes are involved. Yet inversion, linkage and crossing over are all perfectly acceptable factors in the syn thetic theory; it's hard to see why Goldschmidt thought a statistical theory like the Darwinian could accommodate only one mutation at a time with no larger changes or interactions between loci. Similarly, on the second criticism, neo-Darwinism does not appear to demand that all varieties be incipient species, but only that some should be so, or should be capable of being so. Again, Goldschmidt is replying to a much exag gerated claim. His own positive account of the origin of species, moreover, is partly confused, partly in obvious harmony with the neo-Darwinian version. He claims that macroevolution originates through changes in what he calls the "reaction system" of the organism. Now again, if he just means that genes don't act singly but in genotypes, no one could disagree?that thesis would be shared by all current theories. And the triggering of large ontogenetic changes through mutations early in development is again a feature his account shares with most others. It is the basis of concepts like "neoteny" or "paedomorphosis," which are conspicuous in many neo-Darwinian arguments, notably in those of De Beer, whom Goldschmidt quotes with approval. So either it is not clear what he is talking about, or it is not clear how what he is saying is opposed to Darwinism. For De Beer, see n50, below. 41. For an account of Goldschmidt's work see G. E. Allen, "Opposition to the Mendelian-Chromosome Theory: The Physiological and Developmental Genetics of Richard Goldschmidt," Journal of the History of Biology 7 (1974): 49-92.
