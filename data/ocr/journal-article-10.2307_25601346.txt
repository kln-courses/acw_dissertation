Serving as a Directory in Viewing that Noble Cabinet (1762). "Among the Numbers whom Curiosity prompted to get a Sight of this Collection, I was of Course one," he notes in his introductory remarks, "but the Time allowed to view it was so short, and the Rooms so numerous, that it was impossible, without some Kind of Directory, to form a proper Idea of the Particulars." Powlett is able to provide to others what he himself lacked, a summary of the general contents which he "can offer ... as a Kind of Directory to those who are inclined to see the Museum; it will likewise serve to give a tolerable Idea of the Contents to those who have no Opportunity of seeing it, and to refresh the Memory, where perhaps it hath been viewed in a cursory Manner."1 As a guide, a substitute, and a revision to, for, and of the national museum, Powlett's General Contents will allow the reader "to form a proper Idea of the Particulars," where Powlett's own experience was one of insufficient time and overabundant rooms. Powlett's situation "among the numbers" of the curious and his oscilla tion between a contemplation of the particulars and an apprehension of the museum as a whole elucidate the form and function of the guidebook with particular clarity, but are by no means unique to his pen or his object of contemplation. A Companion to every Place of Curiosity and Entertainment in and about London and Westminster (1767) offers itself as "a Directory to Strangers to make Choice of Objects suitable to the Time they have to spare, and to enable them to relate what they have seen," and it notes in its preface that "the Desire which leads us to see whatever is Antique, Remarkable, or Uncommon, being commended by all; and that Desire almost universally prevailing, a Compilation of this kind must be very acceptable to the Inquisitive." Powlett's initial predicament is obviously not uncommon, for the Companion also notes that "it has been a general Complaint, that in viewing so many different Departments, the Time allotted is so short, and the Objects so numerous, that it was impossible to I.

In both the national museum and the larger world of social practice, curiosity and the desire for entertainment may be "almost universally prevailing," but without such companions and directories, forming "a proper Idea of the Particulars" proves a hard task indeed. An Historical Account of the Curiosities of London and Westminster (1777) gets even more to the heart of the matter. Having also noted that "the Desire of seeing the Antiquities and Rarities of our Country is allowed by all to be a laudable Curiosity," the guide notes in its preface to the Tower of London that "it is a general Complaint, that the Mind, being crowded with too many Objects at once, cannot distinguish, amidst so great a variety, what is worthy to be dwelt upon, and what is not."3 These guidebooks, like many others of their time, offer themselves figuratively as ameliorations to this complaint, directories which may guide, supplement, and revise in memory the raw experience of the collections. These collec tions may be actual specimens and antiquities on exhibition in the muse ums, abbeys, and towers of London, or simply the lived experience of its urban dwellers, transformed into curiosities by the desirous spectator. This problematic of specular curiosity was also elucidated by another museum guide, William Wordsworth, who defended his sonnet "With ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh" to Lady Beaumont in 1806 by asking "who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects, of which it either cannot make one whole, or from which it cannot single out one individual, whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided or distracted by a multitude?"4 The sonnet itself joins desire with observation as a means of soothing the restless mind, as the poet singles out a ship among the many and "pursue[s] her with a Lover's look / This Ship to all the rest did I prefer" (10-11).5 The alternative to such an amorous preference would be what Wordsworth in another con text defined as the consummation of the sublime: "whatever suspends the comparing power of the mind &amp; possesses it with a feeling or image of intense unity, without a conscious contemplation of parts, has produced 2.

The challenge to the guidebook is to mediate between these two poles of specular fulfillment, maintaining the "general complaint" as a means of perpetuating itself as an amelioration. When the poet turns to his autobiographical identity, exhibiting his very memory itself as a formal structure, guidebook and museum are joined and the dialogue between complaint and amelioration moves from a means of discursive existence to a production of the very form itself. As a simulta neous guide, substitute, and re-vision to, for, and of his childhood years at Cambridge, the third book of the 1805 Prelude serves as both museum and guide for the poet's recollection and establishment of self-identity: Carelessly I gazed, roving as through a cabinet Or wide museum, thronged with fishes, gems, Birds, crocodiles, shells, where little can be seen, Well understood, or naturally endeared, Yet still does every step bring something forth That quickens, pleases, stings?and here and there A casual rarity is singled out And has its brief perusal, then gives way To others, all supplanted in their turn. Meanwhile, amid this gaudy congress framed Of things by nature most unneighbourly, The head turns round, and cannot right itself; And, though an aching and a barren sense Of gay confusion still be uppermost, With few wise longings and but little love, Yet something to the memory sticks at last Whence profit may be drawn in times to come.

Wordsworth's passage brings together many central thematic and formal elements of his autobiographical poetics: the distinction between careless vision and mature poetic insight, the tyranny of the eye over the imagina tive faculty, the endless dialectic between longing and affection, and the recuperation of past events as symbolic capital whose profit is the very emergence-through-articulation of poetic identity. Understood as informa tive elements of a museum guide, modes of poetic representation common to canonical romantic poetry may be seen to correspond structurally, and functionally as well, with modes of ideological identification enacted in sites of public exhibition. The characteristic romantic movements from questions of identity to processes of identification, from being to becoming, joined those questions explicitly with issues of representation. This con nection finds a cultural counterpart in the modern national museum, a microcosm of broader cultural transformations in which new patterns of ideological identification and aesthetic representation are brought into direct and material relation. Wordsworth's articulation of "an aching and a barren sense / Of gay confusion" is matched rhetorically by the German writer and traveler Carl Philipp Moritz who, in 1782, visited the British Museum as part of a larger tour of England. Though anticipating a leisurely tour through a sequence of specimens and antiquities, memorial representations of silenced contexts which he might reconstruct through informed imagination, Moritz, like so many others, is frustrated in his attempts at disinterested contemplation by the vastness of the collections and the logic of the museum tour: The rapidly passing through this vast suite of rooms, in a space of time, little, if at all, exceeding an hour; with leisure just to cast one poor longing look of astonishment on all these stupendous treasures of natural curiosities, antiquities, and literature; in the contemplation of which you could with pleasure spend years, and a whole life might be employed in the study of them?quite confuses, stuns, and over powers one.9 From the vastness of space to the frustration of leisurely observation and pleasurable contemplation, from the longing gaze of astonishment to the overall experience of confusion and overpowerment?the rhetoric inform ing this passage throughout is that of the experience of the sublime.

(Travels 68), but his experience of the institution as a whole corre sponds with what Edmund Burke would term the sublime resultant from obscurity in which "the mind is hurried out of itself, by a croud of great and confused images; which affect because they are crouded and con fused."10 This oscillation between the comprehension of memorial objects and the apprehension of a categorical sublime structures Moritz's account of both the institution and his fellow visitors. In relating his rushed tour through the museum, Moritz makes a curious remark. "I am sorry to say," he states, "it was the rooms, the glass cases, the shelves, or the repository for the books in the British Museum which I saw, and not the Museum itself" (Travels 68). While this comment seems to denaturalize the institution and the constructed nature of its exhibition in calling attention to the very mechanisms of that construction, it simul taneously sublimates "the Museum itself" as an ideal greater than the sum of its exhibited objects or institutional apparatuses. Moritz's frustration and longing in viewing the objects on exhibition turns his attention to his fellow visitors where he observes the same diversity of parts, but is now able to comprehend the whole through recourse to the concept of the nation. He notes that "the company, who saw it when and as I did, was various, and some of all sorts; some, I believe, of the very lowest classes of the people, of both sexes; for, as it is the property of the nation, every one has the same right (I use the term of the country) to see it, that another has" (Travels 68). The social standing of the collector signified by earlier private collections is now made available in imaginative form to a larger public through their identification with the nation whose material acqui sition and exhibition they may view. Differences of class and gender become secondary to the company's status of national citizenry, a status obtained through their participation in the exhibitionary rite. The shared time and manner of viewing the collected specimens forges and defines national identity through the dynamics of observation, a point which is brought home to Moritz when he supplements the brevity of the tour with notes from a German guidebook which he shares with his fellow visitors. Moritz's actions cause a display of nationalist contempt from the guide "when he found out that it was only a German description of the British Museum" (Travels 68). Just as "the Museum itself" is, for Moritz, a category greater than the sum of its exhibitionary apparatuses, the nation is experi io.

For both Wordsworth and Moritz, museum fatigue registers a dialectic between fragment and totality, between insufficiency and anticipation, in which the discursive production of a subjective or national self-identity emerges in the passage between. Within the poetic logic of The Prelude, such a dialectic is the process by which the gap between experience and memory is reproduced as poetic identity. Within the logic of the British Museum and other sites of public exhibition, the signifying gap between memorial objects and their re-collection in public institutions is the con stitutive means by which social and national identity is both posited and redeemed. This rhetorical affiliation between exhibitionary guidebooks and Wordsworth's autobiographical poetics allows us to rethink the centrality of memory as a transforming presence not only in romantic poetics of self-reflection, but also in the institutionalization of the museum as a public resource for an ideal national unity. In what follows, I explore the exhibi tionary representation and enactment of individual and collective memory as a process of imaginative and ideological identification. To understand and position this congruence between poetic and ideological identification, I consider the writings of one of the most popular guides to London in the late eighteenth century alongside the aesthetic and political theories of Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. I then return to Wordsworth's guide to the museum of his self and explore how his establishment of poetic self-identity is informed by his appropriation of the traditional art of memory and the representational trope of personification. What emerges is an understanding of the interplay between imaginative and ideological productions of individual and national identity in a pecu liarly romantic museum discourse. 2 The French writer and traveller Jean Pierre Grosley's Tour to London; or, New Observations on England and its Inhabitants (1772), one of the most popular foreign guides to England in the later eighteenth century,11 contains an extensive survey of public exhibitions in a chapter entitled "National Pride?How far Melancholy may be productive of it. Effects of this pride, with regard to England." Its opening paragraph is worth reprinting in full: The impetuosity, and the perseverance, with which melancholy dwells upon such objects as interest and engage it, are the principles which induce the English to concern themselves so much about public affairs. Each citizen identifying himself with the government, must of neces ii.

The national body may be located neither in its citizens or in the "high idea of the nation" to which they aspire, but in the passage between the form and the ideal, between the parts and "the glory of the whole movement" which such objects seem to embody. National pride and the nation itself are, in Grosley's terms, inextricable. He compares this pride with that of antiquity and characterizes it as "a pride, which being the first foundation of public strength, and multiplying it ad infinitum, subdivides, and in some measure, distributes itself to every citizen" (Tour 192). Grosley even goes so far as to quote the sixth book of the Aeneid regarding the Neoplatonic union of souls as an analogy for this process of identification: "Totam diffusa per artus / Mens agitat molem ac magno se corpore miscet" (Tour 192).13 Within the dynamic of national pride, such exhibitionary institutions as the British Museum and Westminster Abbey stand out for Grosley as consecrations to melancholy, productively mediative forms between a citizenry and a na tional ideal: This ardour, which warmed Rome and Greece, is to be found in England, and must necessarily produce the same fruits in that king dom. The British Museum, the palaces of great noblemen, the cabinets of the curious, the houses of citizens, those dark and solitary grottos which people of fortune consecrate to melancholy in their country retirements, the taverns and inns, the houses where people meet for public diversions, are all adorned with figures painted or engraved, and with busts of all sizes, made of all sorts of materials, of Bacon, Shakespeare, Milton, Locke, Addison, Newton, and even Cromwell 12.

(Tour 196-97) Grosley's expostulation reaches its climax as he considers Westminster Abbey which he characterizes as "the grand depository of the monuments erected to the glory of the nation" (Tour 204). While he bemoans the fact that the various monuments within the abbey were not "raised by a public decree, at the expense of the nation" but rather "by the family or friends of each personage," this fault is more than made up for in Grosley's mind by the reception and attention paid to these monuments by the national public: The abbey in which they stand is incessantly filled with crowds, who contemplate them: the lowest sort of people shew also their attention: I have seen herb-women holding a little book, which gives an account of them; I have seen milk-women getting them explained, and testi fying, not a stupid admiration, but a lively and most significant sur prise. (Tour 205) National pride is not an ideal pressed upon a stupid and passive populace, but is an active apprehension of a sublime totality by a melancholic disposition. While the individual memorials signify the particular heroes of British national culture, the apprehension of the collection as a whole astonishes and surprises, establishing a proud ardour of national glory. In the exhibitionary sites of the British Museum and Westminster Abbey, the nation is posited synecdochally through a sequence of memorial objects, but the "high idea . . . of the nation" is redeemed in the citizenry which, like the fly in Grosley's fable, sees only the representational parts, yet "arrogates the glory of the whole movement to itself." Identification as such had been a central characteristic of the sublime experience since Longinus who argued that "the mind is naturally elevated by the true sublime, and so sensibly affected with its lively strokes, that it swells in transport and an inward pride, as if what was only heard had been the product of its own invention."14 Longinus was describing aesthetic experiences while Grosley is considering a process of nationalist identifica tion, but the connection was already well established by eighteenth-century theorists of the aesthetic, most notably Edmund Burke, who cites Longinus in the section of his Philosophical Enquiry concerning Ambition: Now whatever either on good or upon bad grounds tends to raise a man in his own opinion, produces a sort of swelling and triumph that is extremely grateful to the human mind; and this swelling is never more perceived nor operates with more force, than when without 14- Longinus on the Sublime (Oxford: Clarendon, 1964) 14-15.</page><page sequence="9">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 453 danger we are conversant with terrible objects, the mind always claiming to itself some part of the dignity and importance of the things which it contemplates. Hence proceeds what Longinus has observed of that glorying and sense of inward greatness, that always fills the reader of such passages in poets and orators as are sublime; it is what every man must have felt in himself upon such occasions. (PE 46-47) The "swelling and triumph," the "transport and . . . inward pride," the arrogation of "the glory of the whole movement" to the subjective viewer of the sublime is, for all three writers, a process of identification. The objects themselves are not the objects of identification, but supplementary mediations for a true object of desire which is the very breakdown of the division of subject and object itself into a unified totality. Whether that totality is manifested in the "high idea of the nation" or the "glorying and sense of inward greatness," the transport of the sublime pushes beyond the representational mode of such objects of desire to an absolute identification between subject and object. Such objects, for both Burke and Grosley, are objects which address themselves to a peculiarly melancholic disposition. Burke's subject who is "conversant with terrible objects," is engaged in a conversation which mixes pleasure and pain in the production of social love: "The passion of love has its rise in positive pleasure; it is, like all things which grow out of pleasure, capable of being mixed with a mode of uneasiness, that is, when an idea of its object is excited in the mind with an idea at the same time of having irretrievably lost it" (PE 47). Burke elaborates on this relation between social love and the lost object earlier in the same part of the Enquiry: It is the nature of grief to keep its object perpetually in its eye, to present it in its most pleasurable views, to repeat all the circumstances that attend it, even to the last minuteness; to go back to every particular enjoyment, to dwell upon each, and to find a thousand new perfections in all, that were not sufficiently understood before; in grief, the pleasure is still uppermost; and the affliction we suffer has no resemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we endeavor to shake off as soon as possible. (PE 34?35) He cites the example of Homer's depiction of Menelaus bemoaning his fallen friends: "He [Menelaus] owns indeed, that he often gives himself some intermission from such melancholy reflections, but he observes too, that melancholy as they are, they give him pleasure" (PE 35). The mix of joy and grief, pleasure and pain, which attends to moments of the sublime, is a dynamic obtaining between two poles, a melancholic subject and an idealized form. Mediating between these two poles is the experience of the</page><page sequence="10">454 ERIC GIDAL sublime which simultaneously embodies presence and absence, in sufficiency and anticipation. Yet both melancholic subject and idealized form are produced as much as they are mediated by this sublime valency. In Burke's broader argument, the dynamic nature of this relation serves as a catalyst to higher social achievement and imaginative production, curing the inevitable stagnation attendant upon pure imitation: Although imitation is one of the great instruments used by providence in bringing our nature towards its perfection, yet if men gave them selves up to imitation entirely, and each followed the other, and so on in an eternal circle, it is easy to see that there never could be any improvement amongst them. ... To prevent this, God has planted in man a sense of ambition, and a satisfaction arising from the contem plation of his excelling his fellows in something deemed valuable amongst them. (PE 46) Imitation serves as a necessary glue of social behavior, commending men to follow social fashion and proper modes of behavior: "It is one of the strongest links of society; it is a species of mutual compliance which all men yield to each other, without constraint to themselves, and which is extremely flattering to all" (PE 45). It also serves as a characteristic of artistic merit: "Herein it is that painting and many other agreeable arts have laid one of the principal foundations of their power" (PE 45). But in and of itself, pure imitation is a form of stagnant memory, a self-referencing "eternal circle" which therefore requires ambition's disruptive influence. As in Grosley's formulations of national pride, feelings of melancholy and apprehensions of the sublime are indispensable if memory is to realize itself in a productive capacity. We may consider one more theorist of the aesthetics of the state, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose ruminations on the organic political body parallel Grosley and Burke's, as well as his own theories of the imagination. His much celebrated distinction between the fancy and the two levels of imagination also establishes a relationship between mere imitative memory and autonomous creative production, a relationship mediated by a process of dissolution and re-contexualization. Coleridge's concept of the fancy, like Burke's concept of imitation, "is indeed no other than a mode of memory emancipated from the order of time and space; and blended with, and modified by that empirical phaenomenon of the will which we express by the word choice."15 Fancy is an inferior mode of creative exercise as it 15- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, ed. George Watson (London: Dent, 1975) 167. Hereafter cited in the text as BL.</page><page sequence="11">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 455 is incapable of producing anything truly original, having "no other counters to play with but fixities and definites" and receiving "all its materials ready made from the law of association" (BL 167). The primary imagination, on the other end of the spectrum, is "the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and ... a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite 1 am" (BL 167). Between the fancy and the primary imagination lies the secondary imagination, conceived of as an echo of the [primary imagination], co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still, at all events, it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead. (BL 167) A mode of agency which establishes unification and idealization through a process of dissolution, diffusion, and dissipation, a vital will which works upon fixed and dead objects: the makings, one might say, of a perfect museum curator. The analogies between Coleridge's secondary imagination and the representational logic of the museum emerge even more forcefully when we consider its mediative role between a memory of fixed and definite associations and an idealization of an autonomous and self-creating identity. The secondary imagination dissolves the pre-existent associations between objects and recontextualizes them in the production of unification and idealization, yet this production is always incomplete, a struggle rather than a completion, a promise of, but also a distance from, "the eternal act of creation in the infinite 1 am." Mediation in representation is matched by mediation in identification when we turn to Coleridge's comments on the State and the distinction between inorganic and organic bodies: The difference between an inorganic and an organic body lies in this:?in the first?a sheaf of corn?the Whole is nothing more than a collection of the individual phaenomena; in the second?a man?the whole is the effect of, or result from, the parts?is in fact every thing and the parts nothing. A State is an Idea intermediate between the two?the Whole being a result from and not a mere total of, the parts?and yet not so merging the constituent parts in the result, but that the individual exists perfectly within it. Extremes meet.16 16. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Collected Works, ed. Carl Woodring, Vol. 14.1 (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1990) 258-59. Hereafter cited in the text as CW.</page><page sequence="12">456 ERIC GIDAL The State mediates between an association of parts and their absolute merger into a Whole, offering itself as the idea of the whole which nonetheless maintains individual distinctions. While the ideal of the whole gains its definition through relation to the individual citizens, and, con versely, individual citizens gain identity through recourse to the ideal of the whole, neither actually exist as pure identities, but are rather produced by the very idea which claims to mediate between the two: the State itself Coleridge's marginalia to Lessing's query in his dialogue Ernst und Talk whether men are made for the state or the state for men asserts this same point: "Not only is the Whole greater than a Part; but when it is a Whole, and not a mere All or Aggregate, it makes each part that which it is" (CW 14.i.259, n. 8). Like Grosley's Neoplatonic civics, in which the dialectic between citizen and the "high idea of the nation" produces the very polarities whose relation is the proper location of the nation, Coleridge's formulation of the State as a mediating idea between ideals which are never fully realized offers us a powerful instance of the convergence between imaginative and civic philosophy. The maintenance of the "general complaint" by its ameliorative guide books may now be more clearly understood. As guides, substitutes, and revisions to, for, and of the sites of public exhibition, such narratives provide an oscillation between "a proper Idea of the Particulars" and an apprehension of the collection as a whole, thus sustaining the desire they claim to fulfill as the means of their self-production. This dynamic form may be understood as one of partial identification, a sublime experience of melancholic longing productive of a relation between the parts and the whole, with identity, poetic or social, emerging in the passage between. Such partial identification is, as Steven Knapp has persuasively argued, characteristic of eighteenth-century theories of the sublime. The empirical agency is drawn towards universal comprehension and ideals of pure reason, yet is, in Knapp's words, "condemned ... to oscillate between sympathy and irony in relation to the self's identification with truth."17 Such sites of public exhibition, "the Museum itself," signify beyond the sum of their exhibited objects and monuments. Gaps appear within the memorial "eter nal circle": gaps between the objects and their signified origins, gaps between the particular objects and their collective identity, gaps between the spectators and the exhibitionary structures. Far from disabling the representational logic of such sites, these gaps are the disruptive means by which imitation becomes ambition, by which fancy becomes imagination, by which the spectators become a national body. 17- Steven Knapp, Personification and the Sublime: Milton to Coleridge (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1985) 82.</page><page sequence="13">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 457 Analogously, Wordsworth's "aching and . . . barren sense / Of gay confusion" both frames and produces modes of representation which ex hibit temporal and spatial distance and presence in the "wide museum" of his poetic autobiography. His rhetorical strategies in the third book of The Prelude correlate not only with contemporary institutions of ideological reproduction, but with rhetorical and poetic traditions whose transforma tions in the late eighteenth century Wordsworth's process of poetic self identification allows us to perceive. 3 O Memory! celestial Maid! Who glean's't the Flowretts cropt by Time, And, suffering not a Leaf to Fade, Preserv'st the Blossoms of our Prime; Bring, bring those Moments to my Mind When Life was new, and they were kind!18 With this quotation from Shenstone, the Reverend Warden Butler opens his unpublished dramatic tour of the national museum, A Pleasing Recollec tion, or A Walk through the British Museum (1767). His title's conflation of personal memory and pleasure with a peripatetic account of the national repository not only reminds us of the affective means by which exhibition ary representation enticed individuals into participating in a public and national rite, but reminds us as well that personal memory and architectural repositories share a common and mutually-informative history in Western thought. Wordsworth's configuration of his recollective mind as a wan derer in a "wide museum" echoes a long tradition of the representation and enactment of memory as a physical repository of objects and images, a tradition considered most extensively by Frances Yates in The Art of Memory. Tracing the rhetorical art from its classical origins through its medieval and Renaissance permutations, Yates's study allows us to observe the emergence of a modern subjectivity through the shifts in philosophical understanding manifested in this tradition. Wordsworth's metaphorical "wide museum" of self-recollection which permeates the third book of The Prelude and links structurally and thematically to the poem as a whole, marks a transformation in this tradition beyond the theaters and treatises of the Renaissance with which Yates's study concludes. Yates marks the tradition's movement from a rhetorical method designed to aid in the recitation of speeches to a theological device aimed at aiding the postlapsarian mind in recalling divine doctrine and on to its employ 18. William Shenstone, "Ode to Memory" (1748), as quoted in Rev. Warden Buder, A Pleasing Recollection, or A Walk through the British Museum (British Library AddMS 27276).</page><page sequence="14">458 ERIC GIDAL ment in the Renaissance as an embodiment of mystical or Hermetic truths, allowing the mind to transcend its mortal state and access the divinity. "The emotionally striking images of classical memory," Yates comments, "trans formed by the devout Middle Ages into corporeal similitudes, are trans formed again into magically powerful images": The mind and memory of man is now 'divine,' having powers of grasping the highest reality through a magically activated imagination. The Hermetic art of memory has become the instrument in the formation of a Magus, the imaginative means through which the divine microcosm can reflect the divine macrocosm, can grasp its meaning from above, from that divine grade to which his mens belongs.19 But just as the art's movement from a medieval aid for a fallen recollective faculty to a Renaissance tool for the collection and acquisition of divine knowledge marks a shift in understanding of the nature of the individual subject, the continual metamorphosis of the tradition after the span of Yates's study continues to correlate with a transformation in the under standing of subjective identity. The movement of collections from the curiosity cabinets and private galleries of the Renaissance to the public museums of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is matched by a trans formation of the very understanding of memory itself and its relationship to the constitution of the individual as subject. This transformation may be read through recourse to the tradition's reappearance in that apex of empirical thought, John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In the second book of his Essay, Locke divides the faculty of retention into two subdivisions of contemplation and memory. The first is identified as the power to keep simple ideas in view of the mind for comparison and consideration. The second is defined simply as "the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been as it were laid aside out of sight": This is memory, which is as it were the storehouse of our ideas. For, the narrow mind of man not being capable of having many ideas under view and consideration at once, it was necessary to have a repository, to lay up those ideas which, at another time, it might have use of.20 As a continuation of the traditional art of memory, Locke's "repository" allows the mind to revive ideas conceived as visual images for selective contemplation. But in the broader context of Locke's philosophy, this 19- Frances Yates, The Art of Memory (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1966) 157-58. 20. John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed.

Hereafter cited in the text as Essay.</page><page sequence="15">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 459 metaphor provides an empirical model for the understanding of personal identity in which the constructions of identity in general and of personal consciousness in particular are conjoined through the exhibition of ideas. Recalling Locke's unique use of the term "ideas" as the building blocks of knowledge, mental representations of the external world which require connection by modes or relations to form a coherent knowledge, we may see that his repository is, as it were, a museum without a narrative, a collection of random perceptions dependent upon the act of recollection to unite them into a coherent understanding. Locke more than once insists that these ideas stored in the repository of memory are to be differentiated from the ideas of current contemplation in that they bear the mark of their recollection: But, our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything when there is no perception of them; this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this,?that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. (Essay 194; original emphasis) Locke reiterates this point and expands upon it later in the same chapter: This further is to be observed, concerning ideas lodged in the memory, and upon occasion revived by the mind, that they are not only (as the word revive imports) none of them new ones, but also that the mind takes notice of them as of a former impression, and renews its ac quaintance with them, as with ideas it had known before. So that though ideas formerly imprinted are not all constantly in view, yet in remembrance they are constantly known to be such as have been formerly imprinted; i.e. in view, and taken notice of before, by the understanding. (Essay 198) This mark of recollection is, in essence, a mark of absence. Locke's editor and annotator Alexander Campbell Fraser recalls Hobbes's figuring of imagination and memory as "decaying sense" and his description of "re membrance" as "nothing else but the missing of parts. To see at a great distance of place, and to remember at a great distance of time, is to have like conceptions of the thing; for there wanteth distinction of parts in both; the one conception being weak by operation at distance, the other by decay" (Essay 196, n. 1). Unlike the memory theaters and repositories of the older traditions of the art of memory, the Lockean repository bears on its surface the very distance and dispersal which have constituted recollected objects as such. Their further collection through relation into a coherent</page><page sequence="16">460 ERIC GIDAL understanding is informed at the outset by the cognizance of their originary dispersal from the contemplative mind. The repository of the mind bears witness to the past through the mark of recollection recorded on each of its ideas while founding a knowledge through the recontextualization of these ideas into relational modes. Locke's adaptation of the repository as a metaphor for the faculty of memory internalizes the Renaissance memory theaters, allowing the human mind access to the truths of the external world, but now with an empiricist rather than an idealist logic of knowledge. The mind no longer studies the images in the repository for access to a macrocosmic world of ideal truths, but instead constructs its knowledge through the act of recollection itself. The mark of recollection is thus the absence constitutive of an empirical logic of understanding, signifying the space between perception and recol lection whence Locke's concept of knowledge emerges. The shift is more profound still. For the medieval and Renaissance constructions of the art of memory, the recollective subject was separate from the act itself. While the art of memory might aid or transform the individual, it did so through the content and not the mode of its signification. Locke's internalization of not only the containment and exhibition, but also of the very constitu tion of knowledge, changes this relationship between subject and act. Both as a means of construing identity and difference in the world around us and as a means of establishing self-identity, memory plays both a signifying and a constitutive role. Locke's conceptions of identity and diversity stem from a central premise that "another occasion the mind takes of comparing is the very being of things, when, considering anything as existing at any determined time and place, we compare it with itself existing at another time, and thereon form the ideas of identity and diversity" (Essay 439; original emphasis). But for the primary substances of which we may have direct ideas?God, finite intelligences or spirits, and bodies of particles of matter?all identities are more properly relations of these ideas, organizational modes dependent not upon the individual existence of their parts but upon the organization of those parts into a larger identity. In considering what makes an oak tree an oak, Locke explicates that the oak, "being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant, in a like continued organization conformable to that sort of plant" (Essay 443). The formulation applies equally in its converse, holding that the individual parts only maintain their identity as a part of a greater whole so long as the organization which binds them remains consistent.</page><page sequence="17">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 461 In considering human identity on a purely physical level, Locke transfers this conception without addition: "This also shows wherein the identity of the same man consists; viz., in nothing but a participation of the same continued life, by constantly fleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the same organized body" (Essay 444). But in distinguishing man from other animals, Locke forwards the idea of personal identity as the sole domain of thinking, rational creatures. He defines a person as a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking, and, as it seems to me, essential to it: it being impossible for any one to perceive without perceiving that he does perceive. (Essay 448-49) Locke's consideration of personal identity as based in self-reflection in time and space joins perception and memory as not merely the indicators, but also the constitutive actions of self-identity: For, since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self, and thereby distin guishes himself from all other thinking things, in this alone consists personal identity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being: and as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now it was then; and it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that action was done. (Essay 449) Though Locke separates his chapters on retention and on identity by sixteen intermittent chapters concerning the various relational modes by which ideas are collected into knowledge, their structural interdependence must be recognized. Personal consciousness exists as the comparative and retentive faculties turned in on themselves. The memorial and foundational logics which inform the passage from memory to knowledge equally inform the passage from perception of the act of perception to the percep tion of a self that must perceive. Locke's internalization of the art of memory not only joins recollection and knowledge, but, in doing so, makes the passage from perception to recollection the very site for the emergence of subjective identity. Marked as it is by distance and dispersal, the recollective faculty constitutes a self-identity as one of mediation, bridging the informative distance between perception and recollection. This internalization of the memory theaters and repositories and its consequential transformation of the function of self-identity in the exhibi tion of ideas is fundamentally a shift in representational logic. The logic of</page><page sequence="18">462 ERIC GIDAL the images and signs in the Renaissance art of memory was one of transcendental idealism, the signs containing essential truths only insofar as they functioned as stable signifiers. Locke's empiricist repository changes this logic of representation from a signifying to a constitutional mode. Signs move from memorial ideas to elements of foundational knowledge through the exhibition itself, the subject emerging in just that passage. This under standing of the subject comes not as an overt element of Locke's Essay, but as a necessary consequence of his adaptation of the art of memory to an empiricist theory of knowledge. What Locke's empiricist transformation of the art of memory accom plishes philosophically, Wordsworth's poetics produces as a matter of form and trope. As a museum guide, Wordsworth actively constructs a knowl edge through his faculties of perception and comparison. Both internal emotions and external perceptions are united through a peculiarly empirical account of poetic agency: for I had an eye Which in my strongest workings evermore Was looking for the shades of difference As they lie hid in all exterior forms, Near or remote, minute or vast?an eye Which from a stone, a tree, a withered leaf, To the broad ocean and the azure heavens Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars, Could find no surface where its power might sleep, Which spake perpetual logic to my soul, And by an unrelenting agency Did bind my feelings even as in a chain. (3.156-67) The images in the repository serve not as signifiers of knowledge, but as immediate ideas requiring the "unrelenting agency" of the poet's eye to mediate between them, producing a knowledge out of difference and relation. In such moments as he is "awakened, summoned, rouzed, con strained" to seek out the universal in the particular, to find unity in diversity, he is also struck with experiences of the sublime, "Incumbences more awful, visitings / Of the upholder, of the tranquil soul, / Which underneath all passion lives secure / A steadfast life" (3.115-18). Such moments are glimpses of unity, of absolute identification, through the compared particulars of the natural world: "The great mass / Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all / That I beheld respired with inward meaning" (3.127?29). As in the familiar master narrative of the Chain of Being, Wordsworth's perception of difference in unity and unity in difference is</page><page sequence="19">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 463 not a consummation of the sublime, but a maintenance of mediation between part and whole through poetic vision. It is the articulation of that vision, however, which turns the guide upon himself, seeking to apply to his own memories the logic of comparison and distinction he applied to the natural world. As the art of memory is internalized as both the form and content of poetic self-knowledge, the poet is forced to compete with the ready-made images provided in the social world: Hence, for these rarities elaborate Having no relish yet, I was content With the more homely produce rudely piled In this our coarser warehouse. At this day I smile in many a mountain solitude At passages and fragments that remain Of that inferior exhibition, played By wooden images, a theatre For wake or fair. (3.600-608) The "inferior exhibition" of Cambridge is marked by a passive state of perception in which the mediations between subject and totality, whether social or imaginative, are controlled by the "wooden images," rather than the poet himself. In characterizing his "loose and careless heart," Wordsworth intones that "I was the dreamer, they the dream; I roamed / Delighted through the motley spectacle: Gowns grave or gaudy, doctors, students, streets, / Lamps, gateways, flocks of churches, courts and towers" (3.28-31). He later describes his return to sobriety after his initial infatu ation with Cambridge as a return from a public spectacle: "When the first glitter of the show was passed, / And the first dazzle of the taper-light, / As if with a rebound my mind returned / Into its former self" (3.94?97). He returns to this metaphor again when recalling the same transition: "It hath been told already how my sight / Was dazzled by the novel show, and how / Erelong I did into myself return" (3.202?4), and he later reflects upon the early youthful enthusiasm of that time that "Such was the tenor of the opening act / In this new life" (3.259-60). Wordsworth's consistent use of the term of spectacle, whether explicitly or as a controlling meta phor, as a figure for a state of passive perception in which the personal identity of the poet can find no room for active growth and participation, needs to be understood as a bemoaning of an insufficient mode of iden tification. The spectacle is ultimately a failed mode of identification in its privileging of the symbolic figure over the individual subject as the primary site of constitutive mediation.</page><page sequence="20">464 ERIC GIDAL Yet these "wooden images" are offered as an initial conclusion to Wordsworth's Cambridge years as his recollections seem to culminate in an extensive pageant of personified abstractions. This trope would seem to pose a direct threat to Wordsworth's poetic self-identity, offering social abstractions over and against active recollection as the mediating and cohesive bond in the poet's "wide museum." Wordsworth's familiar rejec tion of personification in the preface to Lyrical Ballads in favor of "the very language of men" and "the company of flesh and blood" is a manifestation on the level of style of his stated intention to position the poet as one who "binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society, as it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time" (Prose 1.131, 141). We must therefore consider why Wordsworth would choose to employ this traditional trope in direct conflict with his formal and repre sentational constructions of poetic identity. 4 The fate of personification in the late eighteenth century has been the topic of many excellent studies which, while they disagree on many points, reach a general consensus which views the trope as one of mediation, both rhetorical and social. Considering the trope as a rhetorical device, Paul de Man has argued for anthropomorphic representation as "not just a trope but an identification on the level of substance," a mode of representation which "freezes the infinite chain of tropological transformations and propo sitions into one single assertion or essence which, as such, excludes all others."21 Patricia Meyer Spacks notes that throughout most of the eight eenth century, personification was considered "a rhetorical figure of special emotional power," establishing a concrete link between the world of human experience and a realm of abstract ideals, fusing "the weight of generalization with the force of particularity."22 Clifford Siskin reads the trope as "a synecdochic affirmation of community," simultaneously draw ing upon the authority of a community of language while confirming that community as a stabilizing moral presence. For the Augustan speaker, the passive construction of personification shifts the responsibility of agency from the speaker to the "'figure' of speech" itself, whereas, Siskin argues, "overt efforts at self-definition would only tend to undermine his claim to be a representative observer" of the dramatic pageant portrayed.23 Roman tic poetry, in contrast to its eighteenth-century predecessors, seeks to forge a literary community through the act of communication itself, and thus 21.

Clifford Siskin, "Personification and Community: Literary Change in the Mid and Late Eighteenth Century" Eighteenth Century Studies 15.4 (1982): 377?78.</page><page sequence="21">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 465 can no longer employ the tropes of an outdated model. With the passing away of this Augustan stability, Siskin claims, personification is increasingly employed in texts which "convey a nostalgia for an irrecoverable poetic past and/or a transcendent yearning to obliterate all time in revelation" ("Personification" 373). Steven Knapp offers a complementary, but more sustained account of the trope's mediative role in eighteenth-century poetics and its relation to theories of the sublime. Knapp reads eighteenth-century poetic practice as dividing the sublime experience between personified abstractions and a skeptical speaker who contemplates the personifications as allegorical sur rogates. Consistent with his reading of the sublime as a structure of partial identification, Knapp's reading of personification parallels the mediating role played by the sublime object in Burkean thought and the organic State in Coleridge's political speculations. Personification undergoes less of a rejection than a transformation in the later part of the century, a transfor mation which does not so much reposition the trope from its mediative role as it rethinks the very nature of that mediation. Analogous to the internalization of the art of memory, personified images change from signifiers of an ideal realm to representations mediating between an incom plete subject and an anticipated merger in totality. The personification both allows the subject access to the totality and allows him a safe distance from it by which to maintain his subjective identity. The personification, in this account, embodies and enacts the relation between subject and totality obtaining in the experience of the sublime. These various accounts, while concurring on the trope's mediational status, differ primarily with regard to the nature of that mediation itself. De Man's rhetorical account and Spacks and Siskin's historical narratives view the act of mediation as one which unites separate entities (past and present, particular and universal, private and social), but maintains their identities as founded in separation. Knapp's account, by relating per sonification to the sublime, configures mediation as the convergence and embodiment of a dialectic between polarities whose identities are under stood as relational rather than essential. With this range of interpretations in mind, we might consider an obvious predecessor to Wordsworth's invocation of personified abstractions as embodiments of his student expe riences at Cambridge, namely Thomas Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College." Like the third book of The Prelude, Gray's ode seeks to mediate temporally between past and present and spatially between poet and society. Unlike Wordsworth's production of self-identity, Gray's ode places trope rather than poet as the agency of mediation, functioning not as reconciliation, but, rather, as a maintenance of identity-as-difference. M. H. Abrams, in his seminal essay, "Structure and Style in the Greater</page><page sequence="22">466 ERIC GIDAL Romantic Lyric," singles out the Eton College ode as the closest prede cessor to the canonical romantic lyrics he surveys. Indeed, if we attend to Abrams' description of the structure of the romantic lyric, it seems to delineate closely the progress of Gray's ode: The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied but integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds upon itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation.24 Abrams is pressed to consider style as the determining factor distinguishing Gray's ode "from the free flow of consciousness, the interweaving of thought, feeling, and perceptual detail, and the easy naturalness of the speaking voice which characterize the Romantic lyric" (538-39). More to the point is Abrams' characterization of Gray's reflections and recollections as "depersonalized" and subsequently expressed as propositions and "con verted into the tableau-and-allegory form that Coleridge derogated as Gray's 'translations of prose thoughts into poetic language'" (539). What is "depersonalized" is the style, or mode of representation, a registration of the lack of subjectivity as a mediating agency in the poem, the poetic voice assuming a polar as opposed to a central role. Gray places his poetic voice in a stable prospective position, enabling him to view the past as a tableau from which he may draw his sobering lessons. Representation and estrangement are connected from the very opening lines of Gray's poem as the phrase, "Ye distant spires, ye antique towers," combines spatial and temporal distance as the site of poetic address, reminding the reader that the ode is not written about Eton College, but on the distant prospect itself.25 This prospect serves as a topological repre sentation of the temporal recollections upon which the ode is structured. From this distance, the childhood of the poet and the more generalized childhood of the students are defined spatially and temporally as a location of innocence and a potential source of rejuvenation: 24. M. H. Abrams, "Structure and Style in the Greater Romantic Lyric," in From Sensibility to Romanticism: Essays Presented to Frederick A. Pottle, ed. Frederick W.

Hereafter cited in the text by lines.</page><page sequence="23">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 467 Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade, Ah fields belov'd in vain, Where once my careless childhood stray'd, A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales, that from ye blow, A momentary bliss bestow, As waving fresh their gladsome wing, My weary soul they seem to soothe, And redolent of joy and youth, To breathe a second spring. (11-20) Gray's single employment of the first person voice in the poem corresponds with the only narration of connection in the poetic sequence, but a connection which positions Gray as a recipient on one end of the distance separating him from the tableau of childhood innocence he overlooks. While the first line of this stanza, in echoing the opening line of the poem, conflates distance and pleasure, the foreboding qualifiers of that pleasure ("fields belov'd in vain," "careless childhood stray'd," "A stranger yet to pain!" "momentary bliss," "seem to soothe") suggest that the distance is not so easily bridged. While the ode may be characterized as a progress poem, its repre sentations of movement and growth are all curiously static. Gray constantly defers the act of observation to "Father Thames," and his descriptions of the childhood observed from a distance of both time and place take the form of emblematic images: Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen Full many a sprightly race Disporting on thy margent green The paths of pleasure trace, Who foremost now delight to cleave With pliant arm thy glassy wave? The captive linnet which enthrall? What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball? (21-30) As S. H. Clark has argued, such descriptions increasingly come to resemble Lockean ideas stored in the repository of the poet's memory.26 Like these 26. Though our readings differ on certain points, I am indebted in my analysis of Gray to Clark's erudition and insight. S. H.

Such agency is not to be found in the poetic voice itself, but in the very "depersonalized" style which seems to mark this poem off from later romantic lyrics. The speaking voice does not bridge the distance, but rather establishes it as a tension which produces the increasingly iconographic representations of childhood innocence: Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed, Less pleasing when possest; The tear forgot as soon as shed, The sunshine of the breast: Their buxom health of rosy hue, Wild wit, invention ever-new, And lively chear of vigour born; The thoughtless day, the easy night, The spirits pure, the slumbers light, That fly th'approach of morn. (41-50) The passive constructions and the self-effacing poetic voice conspire with the emblematic representations to produce a gap between past and present and between the poet and the social world he observes. The poem accu mulates memorial images which speak to the very distance which has produced them, but requires an agency to cohere these images into a relational knowledge. Such agency is provided by the personifications which dominate the second half of the poem: These shall the fury Passions tear, The vultures of the mind, Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear, And Shame that sculks behind; Or pineing Love shall waste their youth, Or Jealousy with rankling tooth, That inly gnaws the secret heart, And Envy wan, and faded Care, Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair, And Sorrow's piercing dart. Ambition this shall tempt to rise, Then whirl the wretch from high,</page><page sequence="25">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 469 To bitter Scorn a sacrifice, And grinning Infamy. The stings of Falshood those shall try, And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye, That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow; And keen Remorse with blood defil'd, And moody Madness laughing wild Amid severest woe. Lo, in the vale of years beneath A griesly troop are seen, The painful family of Death, More hideous than their Queen: This racks the joints, this fires the veins, That every labouring sinew strains, Those in the deeper vitals rage: Lo, Poverty, to fill the band, That numbs the soul with icy hand, And slow-consuming Age. (61-90) Steven Knapp points out Gray's traditional employment of personified abstractions as threshold figures, in this case between childhood innocence and mature experience, and views their presence as the introduction of an explicitly social mode of representation by which and against which the poet may assert his own identity. But Gray's poetic identity is established through these personifications and not against them. The mediation of personified abstractions affirms poetic identity as one end of a temporal bridge between past and present. The representational agency of per sonification unites the poet with his former self, but unites them as separate identities, their separation affirmed rather than effaced by the mode of representation. As the poem concludes, the "momentary bliss" of the second stanza, bestowed upon the poet by the gales rising up from the fields of the college, turns out to be as static as the "idle progeny" which inspired it: To each his suff'rings: all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan, The tender for another's pain; Th' unfeeling for his own. Yet ah! why should they know their fate? Since sorrow never comes too late,</page><page sequence="26">470 ERIC GIDAL And happiness too swiftly flies. Thought would destroy their paradise. No more; where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise. (91-100) The mediation of personification has not altered the green as a locale of temporal innocence, impregnable to the poet's mature consciousness. But the two are fused through the social ties of the allegorical transport from innocence to experience. While the children on the green serve as memo rial ideas and the subsequent drama of personified abstractions as founda tional knowledge in the poet's repository of retention, the act of recollec tion is inscribed in the style, rather than the structure of the poem, thus deferring agency to a communal rather than a personal language. We may now begin to understand why Wordsworth eschewed per sonification in favor of "the very language of men" as an insufficient means of identification. Wordsworth constructs his personifications of Cambridge life as a bridge between his personal experiences and the wider world of human affairs, noting "That here in dwarf proportions were expressed / The limbs of the great world" (3.616?17). Though initially characterizing his sequence of personifications as both "pageant" and "spectacle," Wordsworth rejects both terms as lacking sufficient substance to convey the uniquely metonymic function of the vision which is "no mimic show / Itself a living part of a live whole, / A creek of the vast sea" (3.624-26). Yet such an insistence on absolute metonymy actually undermines the representational cohesion of the following sequence by proposing an ab solute affinity between private and public which would require no agency of mediation. Indeed, Wordsworth's ambivalent posture towards per sonification is inscribed in the very text of its employment: For, all degrees And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise Here sate in state, and, fed with daily alms, Retainers won away from solid good. And here was Labour, his own Bond-slave; Hope That never set the pains against the prize; Idleness, halting with his weary clog; And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear, And simple Pleasure, foraging for Death; Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray; Feuds, factions, flatteries, Enmity and Guile, Murmuring Submission and bald Government (The idol weak as the idolator)</page><page sequence="27">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 471 And Decency and Custom starving Truth, And blind Authority beating with his staff The child that might have led him; Emptiness Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth Left to itself unheard of and unknown. (3.626-43) As a narrative of institutionalized authority and its successful oppression of youthful originality and imagination, Wordsworth's sequence of per sonified abstractions embodies and gives agency to the more diffuse forces narrated in the preceding lines of the book. Yet its thematic conflation of representational error ("[The idol weak as the idolator]") with social degeneracy ("Murmuring Submission and bald Government") undermines its very mode of representation. Wordsworth's stated distaste for per sonification was, as in both Kant and Coleridge before him, explicitly identified with the errors of Pagan idolatry. In his 1815 "Preface," Wordsworth argues that "the anthropomorphitism of the Pagan religion subjected the minds of the greatest poets in those countries too much to the bondage of definite form; from which the Hebrews were preserved by their abhorrence of idolatry" (Prose 3.34). Wordsworth's thematic qualifica tion of the very trope by which his representation plays itself out correlates with his framing insistence upon the pageant as symbol rather than allegory. We may recall Paul de Man's distinction between the two tropes and their relevance to a rhetoric of temporality: Whereas the symbol postulates the possibility of an identity or iden tification, allegory designates primarily a distance in relation to its own origin, and, renouncing the nostalgia and the desire to coincide, it establishes its language in the void of this temporal difference. In so doing, it prevents the self from an illusory identification with the non-self, which is now fully, though painfully, recognized as a non self. (Blindness 207) The danger of idolatry is that it fixes the play of memory and foundation in an embodied image. While personification may play a mediative role, it in essence freezes that relation, allowing no central role for a constitutive self-identity to emerge. Wordsworthian identification depends upon "an illusory identification with the non-self," that non-self being his own temporally dislocated experiences of childhood. The poet's inscription of "dual consciousness" through the intermittent gaps of time is not achieved, as is Gray's, through personification as allegorical agency, but through a partial identification which defines both past and present selves through a logic of mediation.</page><page sequence="28">472 ERIC GIDAL As a rover through the "wide museum" of his own recollections, Wordsworth is thus able to supplant the personifications of the previous stanza as a mediating presence between the "passages and fragments that remain" and the consummation of the whole into unified presence. As a museum guide, Wordsworth can single out the individual rarities and curiosities or attempt to make one whole of the collection, yet to fully ameliorate the "general complaint" brings the entire project to an unpro ductive close. Like the earlier guidebooks, Wordsworth surveys his options. Analogous to the collection of disparate elements from the natural world? "fishes, gems / Birds, crocodiles, shells"?the fragmentation of lived expe rience necessary for the foundation of knowledge simultaneously creates a loss of cohesive understanding. Wordsworth has already, in the second book of the poem, used the metaphor of the cabinet for a privileging of the parts over the whole, viewing the separation and classification of sensations as a focusing upon the "outward shows" of life which blinds one to the "unity of all" (2.225-27). Here again the roving through the cabinet or wide museum is an experience of blindness, ignorance, and separation, for "little can be seen, / Well understood, or naturally en deared" (3.654?55). This initial evocation of the museum's disorienting effect is followed by a crucial qualification: Yet still does every step bring something forth That quickens, pleases, stings?and here and there A casual rarity is singled out And has its brief perusal, then give way To others, all supplanted in their turn. (3.656-60) Insofar as the poet may single out individual episodes of his experience, he is able to make them serve as memorial museum pieces, engendering narratives which claim to reproduce their lost contexts of origin. But their placement within the larger repository of the poet's reconstructed life creates a restlessness of mind which is divided and distracted by the enormity of the collection. The "gaudy congress framed / Of things by nature most unneighbourly" overwhelms the poet whose faculties are unable to grasp the whole as a coherent unity. The "aching and . . . barren sense / Of gay confusion" which follow are characterized as mostly lacking in "wise longings" and "love" and the whole experience is characterized in the final lines of the book as "submissive idleness." Presented with a collection productive of the sublime, Wordsworth is unable to consummate the provocation with absolute identification. The aching and confusion fail to provoke the proper direction of longing and love which would cause the mind to swell with</page><page sequence="29">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 473 inner transport and to claim for itself the higher unity to which the sublime attests. Yet it is Wordsworth's inability to consummate the sublime expe rience of the "wide museum" which allows him to sustain his autobio graphical narrative and self-representation. In Lockean terms, it is his ability to maintain a distinction between perception and recollection that enables him to represent his poetic self as a recuperative and mediating identity. "Yet," Wordsworth concludes, "something to the memory sticks at last / Whence profit may be drawn in times to come" (3.661-68). As in his more celebrated passage on the "spots of time," Wordsworth articulates the very process by which lived experience is fragmented and reproduced as poetic form. The loss of original context central to the representational logic of the "wide museum" provides the crucial gap between the con structed object of study?whether that object be material or experiential? and the forces of social practice which have produced it: a gap enabling of both memorial and foundational representation. Mary Jacobus has spoken of the "metaphoricity of the Wordsworthian subject" as the coincidence of the real and the symbolic, a product of the gap between external reality and internal metaphorical signification.27 The Wordsworthian self is just this bridge, or repression, of the distance between originary context and museum exhibition; but insofar as it is the Wordsworthian self which produces the idea of both origin and sign, its mediative role is simultane ously one of constitution. The "profit . . . drawn in times to come" is none other than the poetic self (poet-as-prophet understood as poet-as profit), the memorial difference left over between the event and its recol lection, the foundational difference left over between the object and its exhibition. One recalls the passage in the second book of The Prelude in which Wordsworth claims that so wide appears The vacancy between me and those days, Which yet have such self-presence in my mind That sometimes when I think of them I seem Two consciousnesses?conscious of myself, And of some other being. (2.28-33) Wordsworth's aim in the "Prospectus" to "The Excursion" to "with the thing / Contemplated, describe the Mind and Man / Contemplating" (PW 5.339) enables him to configure poetic identity as a redemptive agency for 27.

Such redemption draws its power from the "wide . . . vacancy" and produces itself representationally in the "wide museum." The "aching and . . . barren sense / Of gay confusion" and the "profit . . . drawn in times to come" are two sides of the same coin. Their interplay produces the poetic form of The Prelude, an always incomplete representation of a poetic self born out of an always incomplete identification. Wordsworth's art of memory is a poetic realization of the paradoxes attendant upon the empiricist internalization of both the form and the content of the classical rhetorical art. The process whereby the mind, in the words employed in "Tintern Abbey," "Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms," and the "memory be as a dwelling-place / For all sweet sounds and harmonies" (PW 2.263), is a process not of "naked recollection" but one which both memorially transforms and foundationally constitutes the very identity of the self. The "abundant recompence" (PW 2.261) attendant upon the passing of years, the "profit . . . drawn in times to come" is both poetic form and self. In the fifth book of The Prelude, Wordsworth claims that Visionary power Attends upon the motions of the winds Embodied in the mystery of words; There darkness makes abode, and all the host Of shadowy things do work their changes there As in a mansion like their proper home. (5.619-24) Mary Jacobus cites this passage and its rhetorical affiliation with "Tintern Abbey" in her exposition as to how "the gap between word and thing, once opened, typically proves Wordsworth's richest source of meaning" (Romanticism 99). This representational logic, affiliated both with the em piricist internalization of the rhetorical art of memory as well as with the broader social practices of museum exhibition, is the very model for subjective identification productive of and produced by modern nationalist ideologies. "Among the Numbers whom Curiosity prompted to get a Sight of this Collection, I was of Course one." Powlett's General Contents of the British Museum is more than mere enumeration, but, as its extended title proclaims, a Directory in Viewing that Noble Cabinet. As the guides for the curious oscillate between "a proper Idea of the Particulars" and an apprehension of "the Museum itself," memory assumes a central and transformative presence in the institutionalization of the museum as a public resource for an ideal national unity. The museum guide stills the dizziness of the sublime</page><page sequence="31">WORDSWORTH'S ART OF MEMORY 475 and soothes the "general complaint" with an incomplete amelioration: the nation itself. Contents and directory, public and nation, converge in the walls of the British Museum, Westminster Abbey, and other consecrations to melancholy through a uniquely romantic poetics of identification. Wordsworth's autobiographical poetics registers the representational means by which the nation manifests itself in the museum, but realizes itself only in the guide, supplement, and revision of its public exhibition.
