Kelly1 Late Holocene Great Basin prehistory is a spatial and temporal mosaic of lifeways related to changing physical and social environments. Evidence shows changes in technology, subsistence, foraging tactics, and population density, though the causes of these changes are still under investigation. Current research has emphasized the role of wetlands and, related to this, the so-called Numic expansion, whose timing and nature are still poorly understood. Behavioral ecology applied to a mqcroregional scale probably offers the most useful approach to solving this and other issues, given the exigencies of hunter-gatherer archaeology in a desert environment. KEY WORDS: Great Basin; hunter-gatherer, behavioral ecology; ethnicity; wetlands. INTRODUCTION Hunter-gatherers have long played a crucial role in anthropological theory, and for that reason the archaeology and ethnography of the Great Basin have a special place in the history of anthropology. Anthropology is increasingly interested in variability in, as opposed to a stereotype of, foraging lifeways (Kelly, 1995b). Great Basin archaeologists are learning to cope with evidence of this variability (Bettinger, 1993). This paper is a review of macroscale spatial and temporal changes in late Holocene Great Basin archaeology. Other reviews of Basin archaeology include d'Azevedo (1986a), Lyneis (1995), Sutton (1996), Madsen and O'Connell (1982), Bettinger (1993), Grayson (1993), Beck and Jones (1997), and Madsen and Simms (1997). The term "Great Basin" can refer to a hydrographic, physiographic, or floristic province or a culture area.

The culture area is differently defined, depending on whether one privileges language, some par ticular aspect of lifeway, or correlations between lifeway and a characteristic of the natural environment (d'Azevedo, 1986b). Today, the Basin as a culture area is an artifact of research, extending to the south, into the Mojave Desert (outside the Basin floristic province), sometimes north to the Snake River, which is within the floristic province but which offered salmon to the indige nous population, but not farther east than Utah, although Numic languages are found in Wyoming, Colorado, and beyond.</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2. Distribution of Numic languages in the intermontain West. ENVIRONMENT Highway 50 provides a useful environmental transect across the middle of the Great Basin. Beginning in west central Utah, it crosses a vast basm that may contain a slightly damp playa in the lower elevations where there is shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), saltgrass (Districhlis stricta), greasewood (Sarcobatus sp.), and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus sp.). To the south is the Mo jave Desert, with surreal stands of Joshua trees; to the north, along the Snake River, is more western juniper. Moving west, one confronts massive north-south ranges. Ascending one, the highway passes through a belt of grasses such as rice grass (Oryzopsis hymenoides) and sagebrush (Artemisia sp.); along intermittent streams are scat</page><page sequence="4">4 Kelly tered Utah juniper trees (Juniperus osteosperma). Above 1525 m, there is a belt of juniper and singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), some 350 m thick, formed by a thermal inversion that in the winter keeps this vegetation belt warmer than the valley floor. The pinyon trees provided "nuts" (technically seeds) that were an important aboriginal food. P. monophylla is different from the southwest's Colorado pin yon, Pinus edulis, which is slightly higher in protein, fat, and calories but lower in carbohydrate (Farris, 1980; Lanner, 1981; Madsen, 1986); it is also less pre dictable and productive (Sutton, 1984). Above 2100 m, pinyon and juniper give way to sagebrush, Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis), and grasses. At 2400 m there may be a second treebelt of limber pine (Pinus flexilis). Higher still are whitebark pine, spruce, and fir and, for the 30-odd ranges with summits over 3000 m, low alpine herbaceous plants and shrubs accompanied on some summits by bristlecone pine. From central Nevada to the Sierras Highway 50 passes through the La hontan Trough, where pinyon is rarer and where valleys sit 300-900 m lower than those of the central Basin. For this reason, even though the rainshadow effect of the Sierras is strongest in the Lahontan Trough, it is here that we see the most standing water in the Great Basin (outside the Great Salt Lake). Several rivers terminate here: the Humboldt, Carson, Truckee, and Walker, the first heading in northeastern Nevada and the others in the snowpack and glaciers of the Sierras (Fig. 1). These rivers form lakes Carson, Humboldt, Pyramid, Walker, and (before irrigation) Winnemucca. These are important features, forming wet islands in a dry sea of sagebrush. Wildlife is not abundant is this harsh environment, and it has declined in the last 150 years from overgrazing and the introduction of exotic grasses. Pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) once grazed on valley floors and foothills, and Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) were common in the mountains. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are the most frequently seen large game today, but are rare in archaeological sites, and evidently increased in abun dance in the nineteenth century (see Grayson, 1993, p. 300). Jackrabbits (Lepus califomicus) and a variety of small mammals, such as Townsend's ground squirrel (Spermophilus townsendii\ probably provided most of the meat in abo riginal diet. In the late Pleistocene, bison roamed large parts of the Basin, but in the Holocene appear only occasionally in the northern and eastern Basin. In addition to pinyon pine nuts, small grass seeds, such as those of rice grass, and a range of tubers, roots, shoots, conns, berries, and leaves were eaten (see, e.g., Fowler, 1992). In wetlands, seeds, roots, shoots, and pollen were eaten, as were waterbirds, marsh mammals, and fish. At times, brine fly larvae, (Sutton, 1988), grasshoppers (Madsen and Kirkman, 1988), and pandora moths (Fowler and Walter, 1985; Weaver and Basgall, 1986) provided high returns (see Madsen and Kirkman, 1988).</page><page sequence="5">Great Basin Prehistory 5 Evidence for the use of all available resources can be found throughout the entire post-7000 B.P. sequence of almost any site where preservation is adequate. Recently, however, some have argued that the intensive use of pinyon and grass seeds is relatively late in prehistory (see below). THEORETICAL ORIENTATION Great Basin archaeologists hold as one of their most cherished ancestral relics Julian Steward's (1933, 1938) Shoshone and Paiute ethnographies?where Steward emphasized the place of ecology and population in determining settle ment distribution, group size, mobility, and sociopolitical organization. This may account for why Basin archaeologists cling to an ecological orientation more strongly than other American archaeologists (Beck and Jones, 1992a), and why Marxist, feminist, and post-processual approaches have not significantly penetrated Great Basin archaeology?but I do not think so. We cannot know eveiything about the past, but only hope to understand pat terns in behavior that we are able to see through archaeological data. Archaeologists, and especially archaeologists of hunter-gatherer societies, record patterns as they are manifested over long spans of time?decades at best, and usually in chunks of time measured in hundreds of years. Environment and population density are not the only factors that condition human behavior, but I think that many Basin archaeologists suspect that the patterns of behavior that archaeologists (and, again, especially Basin archaeologists) can most unambiguously and correctly reconstruct are largely attributable to the environment or changes in population density because they are patterns in behavior that are manifested over long spans of time. This does not mean that other factors can be ignored?and it is wrong to allege that ecological approaches do so. This issue is beyond the scope of this review, so suffice it to say that the issues of power, ethnicity, gender, and sym bolism which are central to other theoretical perspectives all can find a place in an ecologically oriented anthropology. Within the Great Basin, such a theoretical syn thesis may come out of current debates over the Holocene migration of the Numa into the Great Basin (see below), for this issue entails ethnicity, gender, and perhaps even power relations and forces discussion of the role of social learning in culture change and the place of objective measures of behavior (see Bettinger, 1993). The Place of Ethnography The ethnographic data collected by Steward and others has been central to Basin archaeology, but enthusiasm for this inheritance is one that perhaps needs to be tempered.</page><page sequence="6">6 Kelly Jesse Jennings' (1957) concept of the Desert Culture is well known to any student of western North American archaeology. Based on Steward's ethnog raphy, Jennings described this lifeway as one in which dispersed family groups moved seasonally between habitats. Projected into the past 10,000 years of de sert prehistory, the Desert Culture was an important concept for research throughout the desert west. Less well-known is that Robert Heizer and his students pointed out many instances where the Desert Culture concept did not hold. Perhaps most notable is what Heizer called the "limnosedentary'' culture of lakeside dwellers in the western Great Basin (Heizer and Napton, 1970). Steward and Jennings were aware of variation across the Basin, and one can argue whether the Desert Cul ture concept ignored or subsumed regional differences. In either case, behavioral variability was not given much significance. The average image mattered, es pecially to archeologists outside the Great Basin. As a result, alleged similarity in prehistoric foraging lifeways over much of the Desert West was assumed, not demonstrated. Ethnography is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it is useful to have ethnographic data to point to the effects of different factors, for example, en vironment or population density, the potential range of adaptive strategies (see Bettinger, 1978), or to suggest functions of excavated objects. One useful result of the ethnographic base of Great Basin archaeology was the recognition that we cannot reconstruct nomadic foraging lifeways from a single site; this ob servation resulted in several seminal regional surveys (e.g., Thomas, 1973; Bettinger, 1977; O'Connell, 1975; Weide, 1968). However, the ethnographic data are a burden as well because it is all too tempting to project ethnography into the past. The reasons that make this poor practice are not unique to the Great Basin. First, the primary ethnography, Stew ard (1938), is biased to the central Great Basin (Thomas, 1983a). Paiute territory to the west was covered by Willard Park in the 1930s, but his fieldnotes are only now being published (Fowler, 1989; see also Fowler and Bath, 1981), as are those of Margaret Wheat [1967; Fowler, 1992 Catherine Fowler also con tinues to work on Isabel Kelly's field notes on the Southern Paiute)]. This is unfortunate, for life in the western Great Basin was different from that in the less wet region to the east. Second, following the order of the day, ethnographers did not record the behavior they witnessed but reconstructed the lives of their informants' parents or grandparents. Great Basin peoples, however, were heavily affected by Euroamerican intrusion even by the midnineteenth century. New diseases (Beck and Jones, 1992a; Simms, 1990b; Simms et ai, 1991), the horse (in the north ern and eastern Great Basin), the incursion of Blackfeet and Crow raiders into the eastern Great Basin, new trade relationships (Layton, 1981), the Hudson's Bay Company's "scorched stream" policy (Rusco, 1976), the passage of thou</page><page sequence="7">Great Basin Prehistory 7 sands of California-bound immigrants along the Humboldt River in the 1840s, the drainage of wetlands, the cattle who overgrazed valleys, and the miners who clear-cut forests forever changed crucial pieces of the social and natural landscape?and all long before ethnographers arrived. Ethnographic analogy in this or any other case is possibly misleading. Current Frameworks Even recognizing these problems, Great Basin archaeologists find ethno graphic data hard to break away from. O'Connell and others (1982) point out that this is due largely to the lack of a coherent theoretical framework, for descriptive ecology had neither theory nor models with which to predict the resources that people might have used prehistorically?those used ethnographi cally were assumed to be those used prehistorically. How, then, to account for instances where archaeology and ethnography diverge? New approaches to environment, behavior, and culture in the Great Basin are influenced by new evolutionary perspectives and employ models drawn from behavioral ecology (e.g., Barlow and Metcalfe, 1996; Bettinger and Baumhoff, 1982; Kelly, 1990, 1995a, 1996b; O'Connell, 1993; O'Connell et al., 1982; Raven and Elston, 1988, 1989; Raven, 1990b; Simms, 1985, 1987; Zeanah et al, 1995). A full treatment of this approach is impossible here (see Smith and Win terhalder, 1992). Briefly, it focuses on evolution, the differential transmission of inheritable traits over time. Cultural behavior is inherited, albeit through encul turation rather than genes, and thus undergoes a selective process. The assump tion, of course, since we are talking about selection here, is that the bearers of traits being selected for are achieving greater reproductive success than those who do not and that food acquisition is crucial to reproductive success. Optimal foraging models play an important role here in predicting, for example, the foods people should select, how frequently they should move, or the size of residential groups. Ethnographic and experimental data provide meas ures of the cost and benefit of food acquisition (see Barlow and Metcalfe, 1996; Couture et al, 1986; Fowler and Walter, 1985; Jones and Madsen, 1988, 1991; Lindstrom 1996; Raymond and Sobei, 1990; Simms 1987). These data provide the information for models that predict dietary change based on changing food densities, population, or changes in technology. Bettinger argues that optimal foraging models assume that foragers do whatever provides the highest rate of return at the moment. This, he claims, diminishes their utility (Bettinger, 1991b, 1993, 1994), especially for foragers who store food and/or who make complex choices about food selection and procurement tactics (though all foragers make "complex" choices), and given</page><page sequence="8">8 Kelly that human decisions are affected by the symbolic weight of foods and activities, which comes largely through the process of enculturation. Thus, Bettinger (1991b, 1993, 1994) argues that Great Basin archaeologists have overlooked the importance that ethnicity plays in adaptive strategies. This point is well taken, but behavioral ecology has never argued that the instantaneous return is all that matters?in fact, trying to figure out whether behavior is directed at a short or a long term goal is a focal concern of the field (for example, in analyzing sharing behavior). The "environment" of fora gers is (of course) not the environment of naturalists?"ethnicity" affects diet in that symbolic concerns, or the control of a food patch by one group, do stipulate the effective availability of resources. The hard part is figuring out when symbolic meanings or some other less easily measured factor is at work. Behavioral ecology provides models that permit one to explore why there might be, for example, gender differences in food targets (and what effect those might have on gender relations); or how one can determine if a people reject a food for purely energetic reasons or if a food's symbolic weight affects choice; or how foraging affects group composition and, consequently, power relations. Thus, the traditional concerns of other perspectives, feminism, Marxism, and even parts of postmodernism can potentially be brought into a behavioral ecology. OVERVIEW OF PREHISTORY Great Basin prehistory stretches back some 11,000 years. Settlement and subsistence of the earliest occupants are still unclear (see Beck and Jones, 1997; Willig et al., 1988). The role of megafauna in the diet is unknown. Since most sites are found along the shorelines of now-dry pluvial lakes, wetland resources are thought to have been important to diet. The low frequency of grinding stones suggests that grass seeds may have played far less of a role than they did at the time of Euroamerican contact. Whatever its nature prior to 7000 B.P., Great Basin iifeway changed as the climate became increasingly arid and pluvial lakes dried. The "Altithermal Abandonment" Although the idea of the Altithermal as it was described by Antevs (1948)?a severe, sustained drought in the middle Holocene (7000-4500 B.P.)?is incorrect, the Middle Holocene was indeed warmer with more arid extremes than the early or late Holocene. Some lakes vanished; treelines were higher; summer temperatures were 3-4?F warmer?large trees even grew on</page><page sequence="9">Great Basin Prehistory 9 now deeply submerged shorelines of Lake Tahoe (evidence reviewed by Grayson, 1993). Increasing aridity had different effects on different parts of the Great Basin. As the Great Salt Lake's level dropped from 7000 to 6000 B.P., it created enormous wetlands that expanded and shrank repeatedly until 3500 B.P. (after which time the lake rose until 2000 B.P., flooding areas where wetlands could have formed). Thus, the Great Salt Lake region offered food resources to oc cupants, and there is evidence of continuity in the sequence there during the Altithermal (Madsen, 1982; Schmitt et al.y 1994). Though the population density was low, evidence points to continuity in population for the Mojave Desert (Sutton, 1996) as well. The northwestern Great Basin was drier than the Great Salt Lake area. Sites of this period cluster around dependable springs (e.g., Fagan, 1974); popu lation was regionally sparse (see papers in Aikens and Jenkins, 1994). In Surprise Valley (Fig. 5), there are large (7-m-diameter), deep (0.75-m) pithouses with substantial posts that supported a heavy roof (O'Connell, 1975; Sampson, 1985) associated with dependable springs. Faunal analysis indicates a winter occupation (James, 1983), but the pithouses reflect a repetitive use of a par ticular location and perhaps an overall decrease in mobility relative to the early Holocene. Water may have played a role in reducing residential mobility. The central Great Basin was even drier. There were no lakes or wetlands, and there is not much evidence of a substantial population. In fact, early Holo cene sites are more common than middle Holocene sites (Grayson, 1993). There are some middle Holocene dates from caves and rockshelters on the edges of the central Great Basin, for example, South Fork Shelter was first occupied just before the Mazama Ash fell at 6950 B.P. (Spencer et aL, 1987), but in the central Great Basin itself, there is not much evidence of occupation after the initial paleoindian use to about 6000 or 5500 B.P. (Thomas, 1982, 1983b; El ston, 1986, pp. 138?139). Even then, some areas do not see substantial occupation until 3500 B.P. (Elston, 1986). This pattern is not a function of research efforts but, instead reflects a general population decline during the mid dle Holocene (Grayson, 1993). As people clustered around better watered areas of the Great Basin, there may have been even larger regional positionings of the human population as well, with places such as California or the Plateau absorbing what was probably a very small early Holocene Great Basin population. The Late Holocene After 5000 to 4500 B.P. there are many archaeological sites, and abundant evidence of the use of rockshelters in the central Great Basin, where Gatecliff</page><page sequence="10">Kelly Fig. 3. Location of Holocene sites mentioned in text. series points mark the resumption or initial occupation of many sites and re gions. After 5500 B.P., sites appear in uplands in the eastern Great Basin (Madsen, 1982; Madsen and Berry, 1975); many of these may represent hunting rather than seed or pinyon processing (Madsen, 1982; but see Simms, 1985). However, there are pre-5000 B.P. upland sites in most parts of the Great Basin, and it is not clear if higher numbers of late Holocene sites point to a new settlement pattern, or if they are the expected result of continuity in a settle ment-subsistence pattern coupled with a slow rate of population growth (and modified by the loss of earlier upland sites from erosion). The return of people to the central Great Basin is almost certainly related to an increase in moisture beginning 5000 to 4500 B.P. Pollen records show that wetlands and lakes returned to many places (Grayson, 1993). In many rockshelters overlooking wetlands, such as Hidden Cave (overlooking the Carson Sink) and Lovelock Cave (overlooking the Humboldt Sink to the north; Fig. 3), the earliest evidence of occupation appears, with copious amounts of cattail, bulrush, and other</page><page sequence="11">Great Basin Prehistory 11 biological indicators of wetlands. The earliest use of Lovelock Cave is about 4500 B.P., but intensive occupation does not begin until 3000 B.P. Duck decoys from the site have been AMS dated to 2200 B.P. (Tuohy and Napton, 1986). At Hidden Cave, the earliest occupation is 3800 B.P. In the Humboldt Sink, shallow pithouses are associated with Elko, Rosegate, and Desert series points (Livingston, 1986). In the Stillwater Marsh, Elko and Rosegate series points are also associated with shallow pithouses (Larsen and Kelly, 1995; Raven and Elston, 1988, 1989; Raven 1990a, b; Raymond and Parks, 1989), but earlier Gatecliff series points are present on the valley floor as well. In neither the Carson nor the Humboldt Sink do houses contain substantial posts or well-de fined interior features as in houses excavated in some other Great Basin wetlands, suggesting seasonal use. But a return to mesic conditions did not affect all places the same. While pit structures appear in some wetlands and along the Sierra front in the early late Holocene [where they are probably winter houses); (Elston, 1979, 1982, 1986)], in Surprise Valley wickiups and shade structures replace deep pithouses (O'Connell, 1971, 1975). Variability in settlement is probably to be understood in terms of several variables including population density, group size, and local versus extralocal resource density and return rates. Wetlands in Fort Rock Basin saw an increase in population in the late Holocene (Aikens and Jenkins, 1994), as suggested by the intensity of occu pation along shorelines after 5000-4000 B.P. Near Lake Abert (Fig. 5), pithouses (5-7 m in diameter, 0.4-0.6 m deep) with a central hearth and some times a surrounding earthen berm appear (Oetting, 1989, 1990) at this time. Research in the Steens Mountains area (Fig. 3) reflects changes in middle to late Holocene population levels and settlement patterns in the northwestern lakes region but from an upland perspective. Prior to 6000 B.P., site frequencies are low as people are attracted to the well-watered lake basins (Beck, 1984; G. Jones, 1984; Wilde, 1985; see also Pettigrew and LeBow, 1989). From 6000 to 4000 B.P., upland site frequency increases as the uplands become more at tractive with the return of more mesic conditions, but sites are small as people disperse to exploit scattered food resources. Site frequencies peak from 4000 to 3000 B.P. and sites are larger, perhaps reflecting a growth in population. Sites continue to grow in size from 3000 to 2500 B.P.; this may be partly a function of the growth of any archaeological record over time, but since sites decline in number, it may also reflect a redundant use of a few attractive loci. Sites increase in frequency but are smaller after 2500 B.P., perhaps reflecting a logistical use of the area by lakeside dwellers. A change in hunting tactics may have occurred as people reoccupied the central Great Basin. Beck (1995) argues that both comer- and side-notched points appear early in the eastern Great Basin, about 8000 B.P., and from here diffuse to the south, west, and northwest. Beck (1995) suggests that through</page><page sequence="12">Kelly Fig. 4. Distribution of pinyon in the Great Basin and some locations of its earliest occurrences. time corner-notched points become more prevalent, and when people moved back into the central Great Basin, they used primarily corner-notched points. She argues that corner-notched points are more often resharpened and were more effective than side-notched points and that side-notched points break (at the notch) more easily than corner-notched points. With hunting efficiency un der selection, when people moved back into the central Great Basin they brought with them corner-notched points. One can presume, however, that hunting efficiency was always under se lective pressure. Therefore, the replacement of corner- over side-notching may reflect more than a slow, straightforward shift toward increased hunting effi ciency. For example, it may be that side-notched points were used for a variety of tasks in addition to serving as projectile tips. The tangs of corner-notched points may prohibit their effective use as knives, but if the hafting were thick, side-notched points could be used as such. Also, corner-notching may be more</page><page sequence="13">Great Basin Prehistory 13 likely to break a point during manufacture than side-notching (Titmus and Woods, 1986). A shift to corner-notching, then, may indicate a change in the way technological costs were perceived and met as a function of a change in point function; this in turn may reflect a change in the way hunting was con ducted and/or the importance of hunted game to the diet. Pinyon may also have played a key role in the occupation of the central Great Basin. Pinyon is a recent immigrant to some parts of the Great Basin? and a downright newcomer in others (Fig. 4). Prior to 11,000 years ago, pinyon was restricted to the southern Great Basin; after this date, it expanded northward as climatic conditions permitted (enhanced perhaps by a shift to summer pre cipitation). Its northward movement was also made possible by several bird species, Clark's nutcracker, Stellar's jay, and the Scrub jay, which disperse and cache the nuts. Lanner calculated that such activity could move pinyon at a rate of about 13-20 km/100 years; his model predicts the timing of pinyon at Gatecliff Shelter (Thomas, 1983b) (Fig. 3). We still do not know the effects of elevation, topography, and historical events such as forest fires on pinyon migration, but the present picture is as follows (Grayson, 1993): In the central Great Basin, at Gatecliff Shelter, pinyon first appears at 5350 B.P.; To the east, in the Schell Creek and Snake ranges, pinyon appears at 6200 B.P., it is in the Meadow Valley Wash at 6950 B.P. and in the hills around the Ruby Marshes sometime before 4000 B.P. Still far ther east, in Danger Cave (Fig. 4), pinyon macrofossils were once thought to date as early as 7920 B.P. (Madsen and Rhode, 1990), but these may have been limber pine; the earliest definitive pinyon macrofossils are now dated to 6600 B.P., possibly as early as 7400 B.P. (Rhode and Madsen, 1996). Pinyon appears much later in the western Great Basin. In the Stillwater Mountains and the Carson Desert, packrat middens, pollen records, and rock shelter sediments contain no evidence of pinyon prior to about 1500 B.P. [a pinyon hull in a coprolite from the 3600 B.P. stratum in Hidden Cave has recently been AMS dated to 1700 B.P. (Peter Wigand, personal communication, 1995)]. Farther west, near Reno, it first appears as late as 400 B.P. (Wigand, 1990). Pinyon provides relatively high returns and can be stored for long periods; it no doubt altered the costs and benefits of existing food-getting strategies (Simms, 1985). However, recognizing that the choice to use a resource is af fected by the availability of alternatives, in some areas pinyon may have been relatively unimportant. Resource selection models that take transportation costs into account suggest that some wetland resources, for example, would have been selected over pinyon if the trees occurred at long (&gt;20-km) distances from the wetland (Zeanah et aU 1995; Kelly, 1995a). At the same time, increasing regional productivity (as a function of in creased effective moisture) would have altered the costs and benefits of</page><page sequence="14">14 Kelly Fig. 5. Location of wetlands mentioned in the text. remaining stationary as opposed to moving. The appearance of less substantial houses in Surprise Valley may indicate a change in the season of use, but they may also indicate that sedentism, with its attendant reduction in foraging returns as a function of depletion, may have been less attractive than residential mo bility, which entailed a cost in movement but which reduced foraging costs by moving. The Place of Wetlands Robert Heizer argued that wetlands provided sufficient resources to permit sedentary, year-round occupation of places such as the Humboldt Sink (Fig. 5), calling this pattern limnosedentism (Heizer and Napton, 1970). However, Heizer never explicitly demonstrated year-round sedentism (Janetski, 1986). Madsen argued that some Fremont villages could be supported entirely by wetland re</page><page sequence="15">Great Basin Prehistory 15 sources rather than with maize horticulture (Madsen and Lindsay, 1977; Madsen 1982). Wetlands are clearly important places in the desert landscape. In the Hum boldt Sink, this is seen by the caches of duck decoys, dried fish, fish hooks, mouse-skin blankets, and a variety of other tools that first appear some 4500 years ago in Lovelock and other nearby caves (Loud and Harrington, 1929; Heizer and Napton, 1970; Tuohy and Napton, 1986; Heizer and Krieger, 1956). The faunal remains from Lovelock Cave and the Humboldt Lakebed Site show a full seasonal range of bird species, although this does not necessarily dem onstrate year-round sedentism (Livingston, 1986, 1988). Thomas (1985) pointed out that ethnographic data from the Carson Sink do not support the limnosedentary model but, instead, suggest a limnomobile mobile, one in which wetlands act as residential hubs. Kelly (1985) took this position further, arguing that wetlands provided resources of poor return rates, and they would have been used as back-up resources or by sedentary popula tions only as a function of declines in pinyon and, especially, large game. Bettinger (1993) rightfully called these the limnogood and limnobad posi tions (see Janetski and Madsen 1990; Kelly 1988a, b, 1990; Larsen and Kelly, 1995; Zeanah et aL, 1995). Both are wrong. Wetlands contain many resources, some of which provide good returns and others not so good. Experimental re source harvesting (such as Simms, 1987) demonstrates that some resources, such as cattail roots, provide dismal return rates if processed for flour; but others in wetlands, especially fish, bulrush seeds, and cattail pollen can provide very high returns (Raymond and Sobel, 1990; Lindstrom, 1996; Simms, 1987). In the mid-1980s, historically unprecedented flooding exposed a plethora of sites containing pithouses, pits, and human burials in the Bear River area (Fig. 3) of the Great Salt Lake (Simms et aL, 1991; Simms, 1990a; Fawcett and Simms, 1993; Parr et aL, 1996), southeastern Oregon (Aikens and Green span, 1988; Cannon et aL, 1990; Elston and Dugas, 1993; Oetting, 1990; Raven and Elston, 1992; Raymond, 1994), and the Carson Sink (Brooks et aL, 1988; Butler, 1996; Kelly, 1988a, b, 1990, 1996a, b; Larsen and Kelly, 1995; Larson et aL, 1996; Raymond and Parks, 1989; Raven 1990a, b; Raven and Elston, 1988, 1989; Tuohy et aL, 1987; Zeanah et aL, 1995). The wealth of data have advanced our understanding of late Holocene use of wetlands considerably (Janetski and Madsen, 1990; for ethnographic data see Fowler, 1989, 1992; Janetski, 1991). Optimal foraging models teach us that the use of any food resource?in a wetland or otherwise?cannot be understood without considering a foragers' options (Rhode, 1990; Simms, 1987). (This includes other behavioral options, such as childcare or participating in rituals, but to date most attention has fo cused on trade-offs between different foods.) This means weighing the costs and benefits of remaining in one place, moving elsewhere, or retrieving food</page><page sequence="16">16 Kelly from elsewhere. Thus, researchers have focused on the cost of transporting food resources, which is affected by several interrelated variables, including the size of the basket used, the degree to which a resource is processed in the field, and the distance back to camp. For example, it is not worth transporting pinyon in its cone for more than a few hundred meters; pinyon removed from its cone but left in its hull can be profitably transported quite far (Jones and Madsen, 1988, 1989; Rhode, 1990; Metcalfe and Barlow, 1992; Barlow et ai, 1993; Barlow and Metcalfe, 1996). But it may not be worth transporting pinyon at all if something is more profitable at hand given the distance to the pinyon grove. Information of this type is very useful in developing models of settlement and subsistence not only for wetlands, but for all Great Basin situations. Based on an earlier model developed by Raven (1990a, b; Raven and El ston, 1988, 1989), Zeanah et al (1995) use an optimal foraging model based on predictions of resource density from soil maps for the Carson Sink region. They conclude that the wetlands would have always been a focus of settlement, with men making more use of uplands for sheep hunting during mesic intervals; during xeric intervals, women and men would have focused on the wetlands, until the arrival of pinyon, when women would have spent some time in the uplands in the early fall. Also in the Carson Sink, Kelly (1995a, 1996a, b) uses a similar optimal foraging based model, but takes transport costs into account. There are minor differences in the predictions of the two approaches, but the major features are in agreement: (1) the wetlands are the focus of women's foraging, (2) the moun tains should only rarely have witnessed residential occupations, and (3) men should have devoted time to logistical hunting of large game in the mountains. Where the models differ, the difference is in degree, not kind: Kelly's model sees a greater potential for fish to direct male activity (if we assume that fishing was an exclusively male activity, which it probably was not) and a lesser roie for pinyon. His model also sees occupation as more focused on the wetlands (when they are present) during hot/dry rather than cool/wet intervals, largely because of the increased productivity of the uplands and other regions during the latter periods. Interestingly, analysis of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of hu man remains from the Stillwater Marsh suggests that pinyon was not consumed (Schoeninger, 1995). This could mean that pinyon was ignored, or it may be that it was not present in economically viable amounts, as the paleoecological data are beginning to suggest (Kelly, 1996a). The virtual absence of groundstone tools in the Stillwater Mountains also suggests that pinyon was not used inten sively (Kelly, 1995a). Since wetlands differ in size, topography, stability, and the types of re sources available around them, we can expect their resources to have been incorporated into settlement-subsistence systems differently, and for the use of</page><page sequence="17">Great Basin Prehistory 17 food resources to change over time as a function of the relative difference in the foraging potential of wetlands and the surrounding uplands. Working at Malheur Lake (Fig. 5), Raven (Raven and Elston, 1992) sug gested that the greater productivity of the land surrounding the lake relative to the foraging potential of the lake itself would have decreased the difference between the two foraging locales and resulted in greater residential mobility at Malheur Lake than at Stillwater Marsh. Analysis of male/female femur cross sections suggests that men were much more mobile than women at Stillwater Marsh (the same holds true for those late prehistoric human remains collected near the Great Salt lake, see Ruff (1996)], while at Malheur Lake, men and women did equal amounts of walking (Larsen et al.y 1995; Ruff, 1996). At Stillwater, women had high rates of osteoarthritis in the lumbar vertebrae, while men had high rates in the shoulder, hip, and ankle (Hutchinson and Larsen, 1995). At Malheur Lake, men and women were much more similar to one an other in the prevalence and location of arthritis (Hemphill, 1996). Although the biological measures suggest that the Stillwater population was mobile, since residential, as opposed to male logistical mobility would be expected to affect men and women equally, the Malheur Lake population was possibly more resi dentially mobile than that of Stillwater. (Both these populations date to within the last 2000 years, approximately, and earlier settlement systems may have been different.) In the Carson and Humboldt Sinks, the full range of late Holocene pro jectile points is present, but in the Stillwater Marsh itself, Elko and Rosegate series points are dominant and C-14 dates on sites and burials fall primarily in the Rosegate range (1300-600 B.P.). At nearby Hidden Cave (Fig. 3), however, C-14 dates and an abundance of Gatecliff series points point to an earlier period of use. Lovelock and Hidden caves were clearly used primarily for tool and food caches, but perhaps only prior to 1500 B.P. (Thomas, 1985; Kelly, 1985, 1988a, b, 1990, 1996a, b; Larsen and Kelly, 1995). [However, the stratigraphy at Lovelock Cave merits a reinvestigation, as Madsen and his colleagues have done at Danger Cave (Madsen, 1988; Madsen and Rhode, 1990), and as Thomas (1985) did at Hidden Cave.] Kelly (1995a, 1996a) suggests that the cache caves reflect a more intermittent use of the wetlands prior to 1500 B.P., with a more sedentary use of the marsh associated with a peak in aridity after this date. In contrast, around Lake Abert in southeastern Oregon, pithouses appear earlier than at Stillwater, by 4000 B.P., but sites of this age (Middle Archaic) are also found in a variety of settings. By 2000 B.P., and more like Stillwater, occupation is restricted to the shoreline and, perhaps especially after 1000 B.P., are larger numbers of?and possibly larger?houses. Pithouses, however, were also occupied at times in the uplands of southeastern Oregon, probably for root collection (Cannon et ai, 1990). In the Fort Rock Basin, stone houses and caches appear in the uplands as well, dating to 1500 to 100 B.P. (Aikens and</page><page sequence="18">18 Kelly Jenkins, 1994). It is clear that there is tremendous research potential in analyz ing the causes of differences in the late Holocene use of these different wetlands. Foraging models that take transport costs into effect should play a key role here by being able to predict archaeological and human biological differences among the various wetlands. Wetland environments present their own problems of analysis for archae ology. Shrinking lakes do not always mean the loss of a food base because a lowering of lake levels often creates wetland habitats?habitats that can be more productive and diverse than open water. Rising water levels can destroy these wetlands, depending on the local topography?a rising lake in a wide, flat basin, for example, only "moves" the wetland. However, establishing fluctuations in shallow lake levels on temporal scales that are useful to the study of middle and late Holocene archaeology is difficult (see Elston and Dugas, 1993). The size and location of the Stillwater Marsh, for example, have been affected by earthquakes that lower the marsh's elevation and shifts in the Carson River's channel. Also, the Walker River shifted its course in the past, for some time before 4700 B.P., from 2700 to 2100 B.P., and again at about 1000 B.P., flow ing not into Walker Lake, but into the Carson River and the Stillwater Marsh (Benson et al, 1991). Thus, understanding late Holocene lifeways is compli cated by the nature of short-term changes in wetlands. Along with better foraging models, geoarchaeological research is needed to help us understand this important "engine" of Great Basin prehistory. Trade Prehistoric inhabitants of the Great Basin traded a wide array of goods within and outside the Great Basin. Hughes and Bennyhoff (1986) summarize the items traded prehistorically, and between specific groups in historic times. Obsidian and shell beads are probably the best source of information about trade throughout the Great Basin; in the southeast and Fremont areas, ceramics are important in late prehistoric times, and perhaps cotton in the Virgin/Muddy River areas (Rafferty, 1989). Obsidian sources are now fairly well-known and their trace-element pro files documented (Hughes, 1994); analysis of glass artifact sources is a standard part of site reports. Still, much work is needed on ways to ascertain whether obsidian was procured directly or through exchange, and we need studies to monitor not just artifacts that reflect time (projectile points) but also samples that could reflect the mode of procurement, for example, debitage with cortex. Clearly, obsidian exchange is partly linked to the availability of other raw ma terial. At the Tosawihi opalite quarry site, imported obsidian may be a function</page><page sequence="19">Great Basin Prehistory 19 of a more restricted direct access, for it appears just as quarrying intensifies (Elston and Raven, 1992). Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987) standardize the typology of shell beads for Cahfornia and the Great Basin. They show that the importation of shell beads into the western Great Basin was at its peak about 4000-2200 B.P., declined from 2200 to 1250 B.P., increased somewhat between 1250 and 250 B.P., then declined to its lowest level during the historic period. No such estimates exist for the movement of obsidian, although it is clear that obsidian was moved long distances (beginning with paleoindian points). Basketrnaker and pueblo sites along the Muddy and Virgin rivers (Fig. 1) contain Moapa Gray ware, tempered with olivine and produced some 100 km or more to the east; likewise, Shivwits Plain was made some 75?100 km away on the Shivwits Plateau. These two can compose up to a third of the ceramic assemblages of Muddy River sites (Lyneis, 1992, 1995). Connections to the San Juan and Kayenta areas are shown by the presence of small amounts (usu ally &lt;5%) of San Juan Red Ware, Tsegi Orange Ware, and Black Mesa Black-on-White. The shells found in Muddy River sites suggest exchange with both the southern California coast and Hohokam peoples. Turquoise is present, and some must have been imported, as local sources are rare. There is little evidence of exchange with Fremont peoples to the northeast (Lyneis, 1995). Instead, Fremont pottery appears in larger amounts in the Kayenta region than in the Virgin or Muddy river areas. (However, Kayenta ceramics typically make up less than 1% of the ceramics at Fremont sites, so is it meaningful to call the greywares in Kayenta sites "Fremont" pottery?) Hughes (1984, 1994) catalogs the conceptual problems that plague exr change studies, including the idea that exchange always increases through time (directly countered by shell bead exchange in the Great Basin), the uninhibited use of ethnographic analogy, and the failure to separate out all the behaviors that could result in the spatial distribution of material (for example, seasonal movement, direct procurement?for a variety of reasons from functional to cere monial, exchange of spouses, migration). As an example, Hughes (1985, 1994) points to the shell and obsidian ar tifacts from Kramer Cave (Hattori, 1982) and Hidden Cave (Thomas, 1985) (see Fig. 3). Both sites contain Gatecliff series points and the same types of coastal California shell beads. In Kramer Cave, however, the obsidian is pri marily from sources to the north and northeast; in Hidden Cave, Mono Basin sources to the south are dominant. There are at least two different "exchange" mechanisms at work. Shell beads might have been procured through the same mechanism (whatever that was), while the obsidian data may reflect a different mechanism, or different territories. Hughes (1994) notes that Great Basin trade studies have been held back by the nebulous concept of "influence," for example, how the presence of shell</page><page sequence="20">20 Kelly beads points to California "influence." Many would discard the concept of in fluence and its implied antiquated normative concept of culture, but few have implemented other approaches?so we trace patterns in the movement of ob sidian or shell beads or pottery or turquoise without much idea as to what these patterns mean. In part, this reflects an inability to determine mode of procurement, but it also reflects the lack of implementation of a theoretical framework of exchange. Such a framework is being developed using models drawn from optimal for aging theory (see Kelly, 1995b). These models use variance in foraging return rates and the degree of correlation in individual (or larger-scale) returns to pre dict the kind of exchange (or lack thereof). And they could be applied to the study of spatial patterns of obsidian, shell beads, pottery, and other "exchanged" objects, spatiotemporal patterns that might reflect regional shifts in social rela tionships (Upham, 1994; Simms, 1990b, 1995). McDonald (1994) has made an important step in this direction. Reviewing the evidence for trade in pre-Fre mont, Fremont, and post-Fremont contexts in the eastern Great Basin, she argues that Fremont peoples were trading to reduce the risk associated with initial maize horticulture and, later, to cope with increasing climatic variability that made harvests less secure. The Fremont Found in the eastern Great Basin, and on the Colorado Plateau north and west of the Colorado River, the "Fremont" is defined by ceramics, maize hor ticulture, and pithouses, and dates to about 1600 to 700 B.P. [see Madsen (1989) and Madsen and Simms (1997) for an overview]. Maize appears slightly earlier, by at least 2000 B.P. (Wilde and Newman, 1989), and is possibly a bit earlier in southern Utah/northern Arizona (Janetski and Wilde, 1989; Jett, 1991). Pithouses also appear before Fremont ceramics by a few hundred years (Janetski et al., 1985; Glenn and Gundy, 1991). Fremont villages tend to be located along shorelines and riverine areas of alluvial fans, in places suitable for dry farming or small-scale irrigation, though evidence of the latter is limited (Metcalfe and Larrabee, 1985). Some contain deep, round, or, probably later (after 900 B.P.), in some places such as Evans Mound and the Levee Site (Fry and Dalley, 1979) (Fig. 3), rectangular pithouses with substantial posts and crawlway en trances; a clay-rirnmed central fireplace is also common, as is a ventilator shaft. However, there are also very shallow, less labor-intensive pit structures and some temporary wickiup-like houses (Simms, 1986). Masonry is not common, but some sites have above-ground rectangular adobe storage units (similar to Basketmaker sites). Ceramics, especially a thin-walled gray ware, include globu lar jars, round-bottomed pitchers, and round-bottomed bowls. Normally</page><page sequence="21">Great Basin Prehistory 21 undecorated, some are corrugated, sometimes with black geometric designs on a gray or white-slip background. These were tempered with crushed volcanic rock, fired in a reducing environment and made by coiling and scraping (see Janetski, 1994; James, 1986; Madsen, 1979). The basketry is a distinctive one rod and bundle type. Anthropomorphic ceramic figurines and rock art depicting "ghost-like" images are also a characteristic. Slab metates are often shaped and deeply troughed. There are significant and intriguing differences within Fremont assem blages, especially ceramics (see Dean, 1992), house form?which varies from pithouses with and without entry ways and internal features, ventilators, and fireplace deflectors to shallow pole structures, and subsistence. Over nearly the past century a number of archaeologists have identified five major regional vari ants (e.g., Marwitt, 1970; see Madsen, 1989), but efforts to define regional variants as ethnic groups or subcultures have been fraught with difficulties be cause variation in one category of material culture often cross-cuts variation in another. In the Great Salt Lake area, for example, Simms and others (1996) show that measures of investment in ceramics (temper size, wall thickness, roughness of finish), which they argue to be indicative of levels of mobility (with investment inversely related to residential mobility), cross-cut temporal and cultural typological categories. Variation in maize dependence based on macrofossils needs to be assessed against recovery techniques and the preservational effects of different prehistoric processing and storing techniques, but current evidence still suggests that there was spatial and temporal variability in dependence on maize (Madsen, 1982; Madsen and Lindsay, 1977; Wilde and Newman, 1989). For example, there is little evidence of maize at Backhoe Village (Madsen and Lindsay, 1977), but abundant evidence at nearby Nawthis Village (Metcalfe and Larrabee, 1985) (Fig. 3). Analysis of stable isotope composition of human skeletal remains from the Great Salt Lake shows a full range of subsistence, from diets heavy in maize to diets low in maize in the same time period (Coltrain, 1993, 1996). Sharp (1992) also shows that there were differences among Fremont vil lagers in the use of game. She finds a decrease in the range of game taken, and a greater focus on large game at low than at high elevation sites. At high elevation sites, people took a range of local fauna but did not make long-dis tance hunts for large game. The Fremont, therefore, incorporates a range of subsistence adaptations, and in some places at some times (perhaps all the time?) foragers and horticul turalists were living side by side, and/or social groups oscillated between foraging and horticulture. This is not a new idea for the Fremont, but it is now being investigated more vigorously (Holmer, 1980; James, 1986; Janetski, 1994; Simms, 1986, 1995; Simms et ai, 1996; Upham 1994).</page><page sequence="22">22 Kelly Oscillation between foraging and horticulture, and mutualism between fora gers and horticulturists, is not an uncommon phenomenon among ethnographically known peoples. We might expect, then, that the Fremont life way might manifest itself over time and space as a shifting "mosaic" of adaptive strategies. Talbot and Wilde (1989) show that the Fremont manifestation was "centered" on the Wasatch Mountains, and from here expanded and contracted. The complete Fremont region was only occupied from about 910 to 760 B.P. After this time, occupation centered on the Wasatch area until 700-600 B.P., when it expanded again before completely "disappearing." Climate plays a crucial role here. A shift in climatic circulation that ex tended the monsoonal summer precipitation pattern of the southwest into the eastern Great Basin (where today most precipitation falls in the winter) may have made maize horticulture possible (Lindsay, 1986). However, there may have been drier periods dominated by winter precipitation in the Fremont in terval (Currey and James, 1982). Pulses in settlement location and between foraging and farming may be related to these climatic shifts and their impact on wetland habitats and the cost/benefit of horticulture. The Great Salt Lake, for example, shrank in size from 2000 to 400 B.P., creating large wetland habi tats, but these were destroyed after 400 B.P. when the lake level rose, reducing the foraged food base. In the coming years, analysis of regional variation in Fremont material culture as reflecting variation in adaptive strategies will constitute one of the more exciting areas of Great Basin archaeology. Virgin and Muddy Rivers At about the same time that Fremont horticulturalists appear, there is a par allel change in the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy rivers (Fig. 1) north of Las Vegas (Lyneis, 1992, 1994, 1995; Larson, 1987, 1996; Larson and Michaelson, 1990). Lyneis (1995) summarizes the prehistoric sequence here: Some time shortly before 2000 B.P., small pithouse sites with slab-lined cists appear in rockshelters (for example, Cave du Pont and South Fork in southcentral Utah). From 1600 to 1200 B.P. small pithouse sites of one to three houses are ac companied by exterior slab-lined and floored storage cists. From 1200 to 1000 B.P., (Pueblo I) sites consist of a solitary pithouse with 3 to 18 exterior storage cists laid out end to end, defining an exterior household workspace. In PII times, from 1000 to 850 B.P., habitation rooms are incorporated into this arc of storage rooms, forming "courtyard groups" of one to a few families. Pithouses continue in use, but surface structures become more common. Many sites are small, but a few are large, for example, Main Ridge, where 203 rooms</page><page sequence="23">Great Basin Prehistory 23 form 44 household groups (Lyneis, 1992). Some pueblos, especially those in the Lost City (Fig. 3) area of the Moapa Valley, are larger than some Fremont villages. In PHI times, 850-775 B.P., there are a few small pueblos (for ex ample, Mesa House and Three Mile Ruin) that form nearly enclosed court yards. However, only 15 to 25 of the 24 to 33 rooms, respectively, at these two sites are habitation rooms (Lyneis, 1995, p. 217). All these settlements appear to have been occupied for only a few years at a time, then abandoned. There is little evidence of kivas in these pueblo sites; those that are argued to be such?and it is not clear if they are?come from the St. George and Plateau regions (Lyneis, 1995). The absence of kivas is important if we take them to be evidence of supematurally sanctioned mechanisms of social inte gration. Other signs of intra- or intervillage organization are also lacking. Although Rafferty (1989) suggested that the Virgin Anasazi were a ranked or possibly even chiefdom-like society, there is no evidence in either the burials, the trade networks, the architecture, or the site size distribution to support this claim (Lyneis, 1992, 1995; Larson, 1996; Talbot 1990). Larson (1996) argues that prior to 1000 B.P. most foods came from for aging, but Lyneis (1995) disagrees. There is clearly evidence of maize horticulture, along with squash, beans, Amaranthus, and sunflower. Many wild plant foods were also used, including ricegrass, agave, yucca, buckwheat, groundcherry, and cattail. However, we do not know the importance of domes ticates versus wild foods. People may or may not have been "primarily" hunter-gatherers prior to 1000 B.P. Larson (1996; Larson and Michael son, 1990) argues that various site characteristics, especially site location argue for agricultural intensification from 1900 to 850 B.P. and that this intensification paralleled a growth in population that reached an apex about 900 to 1100 A.D. Although direct evi dence is lacking, horticulture in this area would have required some irrigation, if nothing more than brush diversion dams. The growth may not be as much as Larson thinks if pithouses and pueblos were occupied for less than the assumed 50 and 100 years, respectively. He argues that the region was aban doned by 1150 A.D. (850 B.P.) after a severe 30-year drought, but corrected C-14 dates indicate occupation into the 13th century, perhaps to 1250 A.D. [putting it more in line with the "abandonment" of the northern southwest; (Lyneis, 1995)]. This is important, for there is a significant increase in stream flow in the early 13th century?and thus in agricultural potential (Larson and Michaelson, 1990). Perhaps the C-14 dates are wrong, or perhaps stream flow is not a sufficient measure of agricultural potential. Or perhaps the apparent abandonment of the Virgin/Muddy river areas is related to the Numic expan sion.</page><page sequence="24">24 Kelly The Numic Expansion A central issue of late Holocene Great Basin archaeology is how the Numa?speakers of one of six Numic languages?attained their present geo graphic distribution (Madsen and Rhode, 1994) (Fig. 2). Part of the Northern Uto-Aztecan family, Numic languages fall into three sets of related pairs? Northern Numic (Northern Paiute, or Paviotso, and Mono), Central Numic (Western Shoshone and Panamint), and Southern Numic (Ute, Southern Paiute, and Kawaiisu). Northern Uto-Aztecan is thought to have first split into Mono, Panamint, and Kawaiisu; each of these later gave rise to their paired language. These three pairs form a triangular distribution that appears to have "spilled" out of southern California, which many researchers (perhaps erroneously) as sume replaced the existing population that spoke (a) different language(s). This is a problem that goes beyond the Great Basin since the Numa were present at the time of contact in eastern Wyoming and, aided by horses, had moved onto the Plains (the Comanche). The southern Paiute and Ute were on the Colorado Plateau, and in the Kayenta and San Juan areas, where they had replaced or possibly displaced Anasazi horticulturalists. The Numa may also have forced Penutian peoples into California. Tracking the movement of linguistic units is, of course, one of the most intractable of prehistory's problems. All we know for certain is that at some time in the last 12,000 years the Numa moved into the Great Basin (at least once). And linguistic analyses strongly suggest that southeastern California is the Numic "homeland" (see review by Sutton and Rhode, 1994). Now we just need to know when, how, and why the "migration" happened. The timing of the migration is problematic. Many archaeologists accept Sydney Lamb's (1958) glottochronological estimate of 1000 B.P., even though Lamb himself was cautious about it and suggested it only as a minimum date of divergence. Looked at most critically, glottochronology is useless as a chro nometric device (see Grayson, 1994); even looked upon most forgivingly, it puts the Numa in the Great Basin sometime in the last 5000 years?not terribly useful. There are three accounts of the Numic expansion. Grayson (1994, 1993) suggests that the late Holocene reoccupation of the central and western Great Basin (see above) was a product of the migration of Numic speakers. These people would have moved into an environment that was more or less aban doned, and then later moved into the Fremont region sometime after 600 B.P. (perhaps as that region was abandoned by the previous occupants as agricultural conditions worsened). This reconstruction may conflict with Beck's idea that corner-notched points entered the Great Basin from the north and east, if we presume that the linguistic homeland is southeastern California, if corner-notch</page><page sequence="25">Great Basin Prehistory 25 ing did come from the east and north, and if it seems too coincidental for people and points to have entered the Great Basin from different directions. Aikens (1994; Aikens and Witherspoon, 1986) offers a slightly different scenario, arguing that the migration of Numic speakers into the Great Basin was part of the alleged 5000 B.P. breakup of the ancestral Uto-Aztekan lin guistic group. Aikens also points to increasing evidence of human occupation in the central Great Basin in the late Holocene, especially after 3500 B.P. Point ing out that there is relatively little change in material culture in the central Great Basin of the past 3500 years, Aikens suggests that the Numic resided there, between the Fremont region to the east and wetlands-adapted groups to the west (the Lovelock and Chewaucanian "cultures" in western Nevada and southeastern Oregon, respectively). He goes on to suggest that increasing aridity about 1000 B.P. made the horticultural and wetlands adaptations untenable; abandoned by their occupants, these regions were then reoccupied by the Numa. Finally, and more in line with the 1000 B.P. date, Bettinger argues that the Numa migrated out of their homeland, perhaps in response to growing popu lation pressure there, and were able to out compete the existing, pre-Numa population in the Great Basin (whoever they were) by using an alternative adap tive strategy (Bettinger and Baumhoff, 1982; Bettinger, 1989, 1993, 1994; Young and Bettinger, 1982). Since he has the Numa moving into an occupied region, Bettinger makes more specific claims about the nature of the relationship between the Numa and the pre-Numa. Briefly, he argues that the pre-Numa were more mobile, and used primarily high-return rate resources such as large game (a traveler strategy), while the Numa, with reduced residential mobility, made more inten sive use of low return rate, but abundant and reliable resources such as pinyon and grass seeds (a processor strategy). They did this by using alternative tactics such as green cone pinyon procurement and the use of seed beaters to gather resources at a lower return rate, but in greater bulk, and thus could store them, providing them with a competitive advantage (Bettinger, 1994, p. 53). Assuming that this migration begins with population growth in Owens Valley about 1350 B.P., a model of growth, migration and replacement can be devised that has the Numic speakers in the central Great Basin about 950 B.P., and in Utah by 650 B.P., just at the time that Fremont forager/horticulturalists are replaced by foragers (Young and Bettinger, 1992). Initially, Bettinger's proposition led to the hypothesis that the pre-Numa had a less diverse diet than the Numa. The only explicit archaeological test?on faunal assemblages from high-altitude sites in the White Mountains bordering Owens Valley, showed no difference in faunal richness, although there were more bighorn sheep than small mammals in the village (Numic) as opposed to pre-village (pre-Numic) assemblages (Grayson, 1991; Broughton and Grayson, 1993; but see Madsen, 1993). However, Bettinger (1994, p. 53) argues that this</page><page sequence="26">26 Kelly is misleading because of the measures used but, more importantly, because the difference between the two strategies lies not in the range of resources taken? grass seeds and pinyon had been a part of Great Basin diet long before 1000 B.P.?but in the intensity of use of particular resources?a more difficult pre diction to test (Madsen, 1993; see Bettinger, 1991a, 1994). The tactics the Numa allegedly used?for example, green cone pinyon pro curement and seed beaters?are not hard to learn (and may have already been in use). Why did the pre-Numa not simply adopt them and beat the Numa at their own game? Bettinger argues that in the postulated context?the replace ment of one ethnolinguistic unit by another?even easily learned tactics can be symbolically charged or can entail different sets of social relations and activity scheduling that were hard for pre-Numa to adopt. Storage, for example, tethers a family to a region in a way that may have been incompatible with other facets of the pre-Numic lifeway. The differences between men's and women's activities may be a crucial link in the competitive exclusion argument. The pre-Numic and Numic lifeways as envisioned by Bettinger entailed different trade-offs for men and women. These trade-offs are by no means simple or straightforward (see, e.g., Hawkes 1996), and their archaeological study will require sophisticated modeling. Among many foragers, for example, the sharing of meat from large game is a primary way that men acquire prestige. If pre-Numa peoples relied more heavily on high return rate, but less abundant game, men might have been more reluc tant to give up an activity that gave them prestige (even though it might have at the same time made them less competitive with the Numa). Likewise, if we assume that seed-gathering was primarily a women's activity, preexisting no tions of work or childcare may have permitted Numa women to gather more food or raise more offspring than pre-Numa women. If pottery played a role in food storage and the cooking of small game and seeds, then its manufacture was another activity that may have been scheduled into women's labor. A dif ference in women's labor patterns that permitted Numa women to be more successful may have been permitted by a difference in child-rearing patterns, or the amount of foraging that children did (which in turn may have been af fected by the technology of seed gathering). The number of "ifs" in the preceding paragraph shows that the investiga tion of the division of labor in the prehistoric Great Basin is a daunting task [see McGuire and Hildebrant (1994) for an example from California; also Jack son (1990a, b), but one that is necessary to create a testable version of Bettinger's model of the Numic expansion [archaeological foraging models that employ a division of labor include those of Simms (1987), Raven and Elston (1988, 1989), and Zeanah et al 1995). It is not clear if the migration and ensuing competitive exclusion entailed a complete biological (or linguistic) replacement of the existing pre-Numa</page><page sequence="27">Great Basin Prehistory 27 population and, if so, if they were killed to extinction, moved elsewhere, or incorporated into the Numa through marriage (and their language lost). Sutton argues that the Numa used warfare as a way to acquire and hold key resource patches and that there is evidence of this along the "frontiers" of the Numic region in protohistoric times; oral accounts also tell of pitched battles (Sutton, 1986; Ambler and Sutton, 1989). Still, although some resource patches might have been worth defending, much of the central Great Basin does not contain such patches. Instead, foraging theory predicts (and ethnographic data show) more permeable boundaries (see Thomas, 1981b). It is not clear if warfare along the historical periphery was a continuation of a pattern, or a function only of the encounter between Numic foragers and horticulturalists, or an ex acerbation or initiation of predatory relationships brought on by the presence of Euroamericans. There is very little archaeological evidence of violence, although it is not clear how much evidence would be left behind in the context of low-density, desert foragers. Human remains are the best source of such information, but until flooding exposed human remains at Stillwater Marsh, Malheur Lake, and the Great Salt Lake, there were few human remains that could attest to such violence. At Malheur Lake, however, a high percentage of human remains dat ing to the last 300 years contain clear signs of violence?unhealed bone breaks, cut marks that suggest stab wounds, and stone projectile points embedded in unhealed bone (Hemphill, 1992). No such signs of violence are present in the Stillwater or Great Salt Lake populations, but these remains all appear to predate the age of those associated with trauma at Malheur Lake. A significant issue is that the pre-1000 B.P. archaeological record of the Great Basin shows considerable adaptive diversity across the region?from maize horticulturalists in the east, to nomadic, pinyon-using peoples in the cen tral Great Basin, to wetland villagers in the west. Bettinger sees some common threads through this diversity, but this range contains much that is not described by the "pre-Numic" strategy and that might not have been competitively "over run" by the Numa as argued by the competitive exclusion model. Related to this is the additional fact that there appear to be two sets of significant temporal changes in late Great Basin prehistory after the 5000 B.P. reoccupation of the central and western Great Basin. The first seems to occur about 1300-1500 B.P.?when Rosegate series points made their appearance across the Great Basin and when climate reached a peak in aridity. The second occurs about 1000-600 B.P.?when Desert series points appeared and when several long and persistent droughts struck (Stine, 1993). Sufficient research has not yet been conducted to say whether these clusters are real or a function of sample size or the exigencies of the radiocarbon method.</page><page sequence="28">28 Kelly 1500 Years Ago A change in hunting tactics may have occurred after 1500 B.P., accom panied by a decrease in the importance of large game. Appearing across the Great Basin (and, in fact, over much of the United States), small comer-notched projectile points probably signal the replacement of the atlatl by the bow and arrow. The bow and arrow may be a more deadly (i.e., efficient) technology than an atlatl (Madsen, 1986), but this is not clear. Ethnographically, spears provide higher return rates, but this may be because they are used on large animals (Shott, 1993). Arrows provide greater range and accuracy than spears or atlatls, but the latter two can provide greater thrust. Perhaps more significant are the tactical differences entailed in spear/atlatl versus bow hunting. In communal hunting, game is often scared into a corral or box canyon, where hunters exploit the animals' confusion and fear produced by the hunters' movements; here a bow and arrow is no advantage. In individual hunting, however, stealth is critical. The bow and arrow permits a projectile to be released with less movement (from a blind or after close stalking) than a spear or atlatl and therefore may be an advantage in individual hunting. At the same time, the bow and arrow can still be used in communal hunting. Possibly supporting this hunch, Thomas finds that Gatecliff and Elko series points are the point types most frequent at rock-wall hunting features; Rosegate and, especially, Desert series points are more rare (Thomas, 1988; Pendleton and Thomas, 1983; see also Delacorte, 1985). Ethnographically, communal drives were held, although these more commonly employed brush corrals and drive lines. This does not point directly to a decrease in communal hunting, but it does point to a less redundant use of particular locales, since the initial labor involved in making a stone hunting wall is attractive only if it will be used repeatedly. Thus, a decrease in the use of stone hunting walls may suggest that (a) large game density decreased after 1000 B.P. and/or (b) the frequency of communal hunting decreased (see Arkush, 1986 for a dissenting view). We do not know why the bow and arrow was eventually adopted over the atlatl (in the Great Basin or elsewhere); it may have produced higher returns by being more deadly and/or it may have been a better technology for individual hunting. Both of these could result from an increasing use of small game, but such animals could be taken with snares or by other means (and were ethnog raphically). Alternatively, the adoption of the bow and arrow may indicate a change in the profitability of hunting large game communally [see discussion of foraging group size by Kelly (1995b)] that would encourage individuals to use a technology that made individual hunting more remunerative. Alternatively, the invention of the bow and arrow may have raised the benefit of individual hunting relative to communal hunting. In either case, an increasing frequency</page><page sequence="29">Great Basin Prehistory 29 of individual hunting could have profoundly affected sharing and intragroup social relations (see Kelly, 1995b). In light of this argument, it is intriguing that caches of snare traps appear after 2000 B.P. (Janetski, 1979). Used mostly on small rodents and birds, these might point to an increased use of small game (although they were probably always included in the diet) or a change in the way snares were used (rather than their presence or absence; possible snare pins are present at Danger Cave level DIV and are possibly as old as 8000 B.P. at Hogup Cave) such that they were cached and hence more likely to be preserved. Given that foraging models predict small game to be part of female subsistence activities, if small game are used more (or used in such a way that their gear becomes cached), this may mean that they became included in male activities. At the same time that these alleged changes in hunting tactics occur, in Owens Valley there is evidence that pinyon pine nut procurement and small seed harvesting intensified (Bettinger, 1989, 1994). Additionally, territories, de fined by obsidian sourcing, contract in size in Owens Valley, perhaps reflecting population growth and packing (Bettinger, 1989, 1994). In the western Great Basin, Elston (1982) suggests that the huller and mortar are added to the tool inventory and that bifacially flaked tools decrease while flake tools increase in frequency after about 1500 B.P. These artifactual changes may indirectly indi cate a decrease in residential mobility and an increasing intensity and/or diversity of food resource use. There are also some significant changes in the use of wetlands in the west em Great Basin, although these are not all the same. Beginning soon after 1500 B.P. in the Fort Rock Basin of southwestern Oregon stone house rings and caches in the uplands appear. These signal a shift in settlement and subsistence to include upland root collecting areas, perhaps for winter storage (see papers in Aikens and Jenkins, 1994). In contrast, in the Stillwater Marsh, where ra diocarbon dates (admittedly few in number) point to a predominantly 1300-600 B.P. occupation, there is a shift to more sedentary village life, [Kelly, 1995a (although earlier and later occupations may be buried in the marsh or elsewhere on the valley floor).] At Pyramid Lake, pithouses date from 3000 B.P. (Elston, 1982), but after 1500 B.P. these are small with few interior features, suggestive of higher mobility. Likewise, house floors associated with Rosegate points are smaller and less carbon-stained than earlier houses in Surprise Valley (O'Con nell, 1971). A similar change in house types may also have occurred just to south of Surprise Valley, although perhaps slightly later (Elston, 1979). Occu pation at the Vista Site (Fig. 3) on the Truckee River, where shallow pithouses were occupied in the winter, and possibly year-round, is primarily from 1400 to 800 B.P. (Zeier and Elston, 1986). Some rockshelters in the central Great Basin show changes that imply a shift in mobility. At James Creek Shelter, a pre-1500 B.P. pattern of logistical</page><page sequence="30">30 Kelly use may have continued after 1500 B.P., but in addition, prepared living sur faces suggest that longer residential use (perhaps in the summer) was made of the site, while shallow pits suggest occupation in the fall, perhaps while hunting bison and gathering roots (Elston and Budy, 1990). Nearby, the uplands saw an increase in hunting frequency (Elston and Bullock, 1994). Finally, the constellation of traits labeled Fremont appears in the eastern Great Basin (see above). After 1000 Years Ago In the 1980s, archaeologists documented the presence of hunting features and substantial stone ring houses in the alpine zones (from 3300 to nearly 4000 m asl) of the White Mountains of California, near Owens Valley, and Mount Jefferson of central Nevada (Fig. 3). Here, people gathered some plant re sources, for example, limber pine nuts, and hunted marmots and bighorn sheep during the summer. Small parties of men had hunted in this area for some time, but after 1400 B.P. entire families migrated to the highest elevations and re mained there for some time, judging by the labor invested in house construction and the density of remains. There are no sites like these in the other alpine regions of the Great Basin (Canaday, 1996). The earliest villages at both loca tions date to about 1750 B.P., although Thomas (1994) has recently shown that the median age of occupation is 940 B.P. for Mt. Jefferson and 345 B.P. for the White Mountains villages; the latter is at the lower end of the range estab lished by lichenometry for the bulk of construction (Bettinger and Oglesby, 1985). if the Numa migrated out of southern California, and if the alpine village strategy is part of the Numic lifeway, as Bettinger argues, the dates should be just the opposite. [The dates, however, stand in opposition to the projectile point inventories, which are primarily later Desert Side-notched points at Mt. Jeffer son and Rosegate series points in the White Mountains sites (R. Bettinger, personal communication, 1996).] In the eastern Great Basin, the constellation of traits known as Fremont disappears by 650 B.P. (Janetski, 1994). The Virgin River Anasazi and, in fact, much of the San Juan and Kayenta regions are abandoned (Adler et al., 1996). The horticultural adaptations in both areas are replaced by a predominantly for aging one (Madsen, 1994). There are some areas of continuity between the Fremont and the post-Fremont, but there are so many dramatic changes?in ceramics, basketry, subsistence, art, even moccasin styles?that some sort of wholesale group replacement seems likely at some time after 650 B.P. Whether that resulted from competition, or whether the Numa?or someone else?simply occupied vacant space is not clear.</page><page sequence="31">Great Basin Prehistory 31 A possible change in lifeway is implied by the appearance of ceramics. Brownwares appear in the Great Basin outside the Fremont area by 950 B.P., possibly as early as 1150 B.P., becoming more common after 650 B.P. (Rhode, 1994). Brownwares were probably being made and used by the foraging neigh bors of Anasazi and Fremont horticulturalists (Lyneis, 1982). Rhode (1994) uses thermoluminescence dates on sherds to show, however, that brownwares do not move temporally in the direction implied by the standard Numic expansion model (although the sample size is too small to be definitive), being earliest in the southeastern Great Basin, where, incidentally, it is just as "intrusive" in the Numic "homeland" as elsewhere (Wallace, in Lyneis, 1982, p. 180). Rhode (1994) suggests that if brownwares are indicators of the Numa, then the Numa coexisted with the Fremont and Anasazi horticulturalists for several centuries before the Fremont disappeared. A period of coexistence is necessary for the competitive exclusion model to work. Wetlands may have witnessed another change in settlement patterns after 1000 B.P., especially around 500 to 600 B.P. In the Fort Rock Basin, upland structures located away from the lakeshore are common, especially around 500 to 600 B.P., but then disappear and are not replaced with houses on the valley floor. The same pattern may appear in other southeastern Oregon lake basins (see papers in Aikens and Jenkins, 1994; Cannon et al.9 1990; Oetting, 1990). At Stillwater, there is no direct evidence that pit structures (or cave caches) were in use after 600 B.P.?although the presence of Desert Side-notched points on the valley floor outside the marsh shows that people were present. These changes may be related to arid conditions, including at least three massive droughts, that would have significantly reduced the foraging potential of wetlands. The huge (325 ha) Tosawihi chert quarry in northern Nevada, used for 8000 or so years, saw intense activity after 1000 B.P., perhaps as a function of the production of biface blanks for trade (see Elston and Raven, 1992). If so, given the above arguments over the implications of trade, this would imply a new set of regional relationships. The Numic Question The migration of Numic speakers into the Great Basin could be related to some, all, or none of these two sets of changes. The timing of the expansion cannot be resolved by appeal to linguistic dating techniques or to the archae ological transitions themselves. These two sets of changes may be related to climate change, population growth, and/or ethnic replacement. Climatic change has not played a key role in explanations of the alleged Numic migration, with one exception. Aikens (1994; Aikens and Witherspoon, 1986) argues that the Numa expanded to the</page><page sequence="32">32 Kelly east and west from their central Great Basin homeland during an arid interval that peaked around 1500 B.P. and that was followed by several intensive droughts up to about 1050 B.P. (Stine, 1993). But were the Numa the folks that built pithouses in the Stillwater Marsh from 1300 to 600 B.P., or were they later peoples, making Desert Side-notched points, and not (apparently) pit structures? Did they make the upland structures around the lakes of southeastern Oregon, or were they later migrants?who killed people at Malheur Lake? Using projectile point frequencies (always a tenuous approach), there is just about everywhere an increase in the number of points deposited over time, an increase that is not out of line with that expected from a slow rate of growth (Raven 1994). Thomas (1994) and Grayson (1994) suggest that the late appear ance of alpine villages is probably related to in situ population growth and ensuing intensification and/or diversification of resource use. Unfortunately, Bettinger (1994) does not think that the intrusion of the Numa would alter a population growth curve from that generated by in situ growth. The local effects of both climate and population growth need to be considered in more detail before we attribute any late Holocene archaeological change to the Numic ex pansion. If a climatic change was the selective agent that permitted the Numa to out compete the existing population, it might be hard to sort migration out from in situ adaptive change. Tracking Ethnicity On the surface, genetic data may seem to be the best indicator of population (biological) replacement, but the available data are equivocal. Analysis.of serum albumin and mitochondrial DNA recovered from human skeletal remains in the Stillwater Marsh both suggest that the Stillwater population was not ancestral to Washo or CaJifornian Penutian peoples; however, the serum albumin study points to southern Uto-Aztecan or Yuman peoples as descendants, while the mitochon drial DNA analysis excludes them (Smith et al, 1995; Kaestle, 1995). DNA analyses of human skeletal remains of Fremont age near the Great Salt Lake suggest that their ancestors lie to the south (for example, Pima) and that they share an ancestry with the Anasazi, but are genetically divergent from them in some ways (Parr et aL, 1996). We can probably say that the Stillwater population and the contemporary Great Salt Lake population are not the same. Beyond this, even if we had adequate skeletal data, DNA will not provide easy answers to questions of the Numic expansion because biological replacement is not neces sarily coeval with ethnic replacement. Pottery deserves a special mention here. In the past, pottery types have served primarily as ethnic indicators of the Numa or, in Utah, as indicators of Fremont ethnic variants (see papers in Griset, 1986). More and more, however,</page><page sequence="33">Great Basin Prehistory 33 the "types" of Great Basin ceramics appear to grade into one another depending on which attribute is examined (Bettinger, 1986; Dean, 1992; Fawcett and Simms, 1993). New work focuses on the function of pottery (e.g., Mack, 1990), the relationships between performance characteristics of pottery (heat transfer, fragility, etc.), diet, mobility (e.g., Reid, 1990; Plew and Bennick, 1990), and spatiotemporal and associational variability in attributes that measure up-front investment in pottery [for example, thickness, surface finishing, temper type, size, and homogeneity (see Fawcett and Simms, 1993)]. We should understand these aspects of pottery production and use before assigning ceramic types to ethnic groups (see Simms et ai, 1996). We do not know if the Nurnic expansion as envisioned in any scenario actually happened. If we did not have the linguistic data, we might not even have postulated the Numic expansion (K. Jones, 1994), or we might have at tributed it to another time. Leaving aside the issue of age, we also cannot say with assurance whether we are looking for a single or multiple migrations, a wave-front advance, or something more like a braided stream (Simms, 1994). We run up against the age-old problem of using material culture to track ethnic change. How much has to change for us to infer ethnic replacement? Material culture of the ethnographically known inhabitants of the Great Basin is in some instances radically different from the respective archaeological ma terial (Fowler, 1994). This is perhaps especially true of basketry (Adovasio and Pedler, 1994), and Adovasio has argued repeatedly that basketry is the best indicator of ethnic replacement. (However, sample size is a significant problem here. We have a small sample of post-600 B.P. organic artifacts for the Great Basin as a whole, but it is a treasure trove compared to what we have for the pre-600 B.P..period.) Following the old-dog-can't-afford-to-learn-a-new-trick argument, the com plexity of basketry manufacture may make this technology a reliable ethnic marker; but does a change in the way a basket or fishing net is made necessarily reflect a change in ethnic population? The sort of pottery techniques we see changing over time in the Great Basin is not that difficult to master, especially if one already knows something about clay, temper, and firing. Yet these too change. How difficult does a trick have to be for an old dog not to learn it? What conditions whether an ethnic group will borrow a technique from another? Material culture does carry symbolic loads and can be rejected for that reason. However, material culture also reflects different choices about where one de votes time. A change in technology may directly reflect those choices and only indirectly reflect ethnicity. In some places, such as the western Great Basin there are no detectable changes in material culture at the critical time(s) (Elston, 1994; Raven, 1994)? although the basketry of Lovelock Cave is significantly different from that of the Paiute (Fowler, 1994). In other areas, there is both continuity and discon</page><page sequence="34">34 Kelly tinuity in material culture. Projectile point styles and basketry change in the northern Great Basin, but the Wahmuza lanceolate biface is present for the last 4000 years. In agreement with Grayson, Holmer (1990, 1994) sees this and other evidence as pointing to a Numic presence there for the past 4000 years. Outside the Great Basin, in Colorado (Reed, 1994) and Wyoming (Larson and Kornfeld, 1994), changes in material culture signal a late prehistoric appearance of the Numa, but what is considered Numic here is not always what others consider Numic elsewhere. How do we separate a change in ethnicity from in situ adaptive changes? Are parching trays late in the Mojave Desert [Sutton, 1994 (these are, inciden tally, the only archaeological examples in the Great Basin)] because the Numa arrived late with a seed-intensive subsistence, or because climate, population growth or some other factors encouraged the local population to alter their sub sistence? The question of the Numic expansion means that archaeologists must con sider the interaction of "ethnic" groups and this means that we must traverse some unfamiliar terrain: the often bewildering ways in which people categorize themselves and are categorized by others, and how groups of people who view themselves as different interact in different circumstances (see Larson and Korn feld, 1994). Even cultural anthropologists?who talk to people!?have a tough time with this. Groups who see themselves as different from one another may be indistinguishable genetically, linguistically, or in terms of material culture. Bettinger's (1994) account of the Numic expansion explicitly takes ethnicity into account, but where he treats ethnicity as units of analysis, as pseudo-spe cies, I would focus more on the nature of ethnic boundary maintenance. Ethnicity is part of adaptation, not just a unit of adaptation. How individuals relate to others they perceive as different channels behavior as much as envi ronment, technology, and population density. The degree to which there are boundaries between groups is an element of adaptive strategy. Language itself can be part of that process and not only a passive recorder of the social units involved. This is a crucial question, for in Aiken's and Bettinger's views, some period of coexistence between "ethnic" groups is required. It is not clear, though, how we would determine if one group outcompeted the other. Fremont horticulturalists were clearly living side-by-side with foragers for several hun dred years. Did the horticulturalists leave (or become foragers as climatic change made maize horticulture unattractive)? Were those foragers living cheek by-jowl with horticulturalists the Numa? Or did the Numa arrive later, as Madsen (1994) suggests, and replace the foragers and their former horticultu ralist-neighbore-tumed-foragers? And, finally, how should we think of this expansion?as a wave of advance or a migration stream? One or many migrations? Is it logical to speak of the</page><page sequence="35">Great Basin Prehistory 35 date of the migration? (Simms, 1994). Is it better to give up on linking artifacts to ethnic groups and focus instead on modeling the nature of ethnic boundaries? I suspect that the question of the Numic expansion will move Great Basin archaeologists in new directions of both middle range and general theory, far beyond the dominant cultural ecological and even evolutionary approaches cur rently used. CONCLUDING REMARKS Great Basin archaeology is moving away from cultural historical entities and analysis. Remaining within a materialist framework, much research em ploys one or another evolutionary ecological approach. Others employ the term adaptation but it often just means "lifeway" and does not refer to selection or the results of a selective process. Evolution is the differential survival of variants (be they biological or be havioral). It is not yet clear how cultural evolution, the differential survival of ideas, ways of going about things, values, etc., relates to reproductive behav ior?a topic beyond the subject of this paper?although it should be clear that if a human group does not reproduce, it will not be evolutionarily successful. It is clear that the study of evolutionary process requires that we openly embrace and study variability (Bettinger, 1993). Since diversity is related to sample size, then the study of variability could not begin until sufficient field work had been done in different areas. We are certainly at that point now. To make use of these data we need to shift from the construction of types and "mean" characterizations of culture-historical units to studies that examine vari ability in attributes across space and time. In this regard, perhaps one of the greatest lessons to come out of Great Basin archaeology, one that is only now being implemented, is that the study of foraging adaptations requires analysis of macroregional patterns. I am not speaking of the regional studies of the 1970s and 1980s, where an entire sea sonal round was thought to be encompassed in a survey area, but of Great Basin-wide studies that permit us to see large spatiotemporal patterns in be havior. Examples include Beck's (1995) analysis of side-versus comer-notched projectile points or Simms' examination of adaptive variability among the Fre mont (1986, 1990b). Such data are archaeology's strength, but we need methods of analysis and theory appropriate to them. A macroregional perspective is es pecially important for the issue of the Numic expansion. There are potential linkages between social hierachialization in California, agricultural intensifica tion in the southwest, and the Great Basin. Perhaps these all are local responses to the same macroregional process of population growth, emigration, and cul tural competition.</page><page sequence="36">36 Kelly We must also grapple with the fact that much of Great Basin archaeology comes from surface sites, replete with dating and associational problems. Unless we wish to write-off this surface archaeology?and I do not think we do?then we need to decide how best to use it. One approach is to dispense with the notion of site-and-seek patterning on larger scales (Thomas, 1988) or to build up a distributional record from individual items that can be dated (Jones and Beck, 1992). At the same time, however, greater consideration has to be given to internal site structure as intense analyses of sites?the White Mountain villages come to mind?still provide important tests of hypotheses. Ethnoarchaeology has given us a better understanding of forager site structure, one important obser vation being that relevant patterning may be observed only on large scales, requiring excavations much larger than those we normally see (see O'Connell, 1987, 1993; Simms, 1989; Metcalfe and Heath, 1990; Tipps, 1993). The issue of the Numic expansion brings to the forefront two issues. First, we will need better measures of diet?of both the range of items taken and the "intensity" of use of those. Archaeological assemblages are normally conglom erates of many seasons and years, and they show the full range of resources used, even those taken in the most dire of circumstances. How is dietary rich ness to be measured with such data (see Madsen, 1993; Broughton and Grayson, 1993)? How would we know if there was a change in the "intensity" of seed use? Additionally, the answers to questions such as this need to be asked in light of the available resource base. Was, for example, pinyon present in a given range or not? Answers to such questions are provided for plant foods by pollen cores, but we have less information on changes in game densities except on a very large scale (e.g., Pleistocene/Holocene changes). To do so requires the reconstruction of changes in faunal densities based on samples from non cultural deposits (pack-rate middens, carnivore lairs, etc.). There were, for example, considerable early Holocene changes in small fauna such as pygmy rabbit (Grayson, 1988), as well as large fauna such as elk and bison. Did other such changes occur later? Given the relatively high return rates of small fauna, what role do changes in the density of small fauna play in the intensity of seed use? Could a late Holocene warming have decreased the density of small fauna to the point where seeds would have become a more prevalent part of foods taken by women? Second, the Numic expansion shows that the role of ethnicity in human subsistence change needs more scrutiny. Humans learn their behavior socially as members of groups; their behavior cannot be completely understood in terms only of objective measures of utility [see Bettinger (1993) for discussion spe cifically on the Numic expansion]. Under what conditions does ethnicity become a boundary? What are the costs and benefits to restricting access to critical resources (technology, pinyon groves, spouses)? When is behavior main</page><page sequence="37">Great Basin Prehistory 37 tained, even if inefficient in the face of changing circumstances, because it is a flag of affiliation? And is it relevant to the scale of behavioral change that archaeological data record (especially that of foragers)? We do not know the answers to these questions. A useful starting point may be to consider the trade-offs that are implied in the choices that people make. Optimal foraging models in Great Basin anthropology often assume that people maximize the return rate of some activity (be it root collection or stone quarrying). There are good reasons for this assumption (see Smith and Winter halder, 1992), and it is more explicit than the concept of efficiency used in cultural ecological studies. But it is not especially useful if models assume maximization without positing the opportunity costs?the activities that are foregone?of a particular behavior. Something always competes for one's time?if a man goes hunting, for example, he may forgo the opportunity to participate in ceremonial activities or to care for his children. Modeling these behavioral trade-offs and their archaeological expectations is an important step in advancing our understanding of Great Basin prehistory (see Hawkes, 1996). To do so, however, archaeologists will have to devote considerably more time to better understanding prehistoric technology. Archaeologists draw many conclusions from spatiotemporal patterns in technology, yet we have a surpris ingly vague theory of technology. A serious application of behavioral ecology to archaeology requires constant interplay between archeological and "actualistic" research. We need more experimentation and modeling to understand the relation ship between technology and behavior in order to know how to interpret technological changes in terms of human behavior. Borrowing approaches from optimal foraging theory, this work is already under way in the Great Basin in the areas of stone tool production and quarrying (see Elston and Raven, 1992, Chap. 12; Elston and Budy, 1990, Chap. 14), and ceramics (Fawcett and Simms, 1993; 1995; Simms et al, 1996). Important replicative work has increased un derstanding of the basic parameters of projectile point production, but we need more data on production times and use-lives. The ethnographic and ethnohistoric record has probably not been fully tapped to construct or test models of technology; closer attention to protohistoric and historic changes in the material culture of the native peoples of the Great Basin might be fruitful. Griset's (1990) study of historic changes in Native American pottery of southern California is an example; Simms' (1989) analysis of an historic wickiup site is another. There is also more to learn about structure and process in subsistence change from ethnographic and ethnohistoric docu ments, for example, the use of limited horticulture in the contact period as a function of Euroamerican-linked declines in abundance and reliability of some resources such as grasses, and constraints on mobility (see Winter and Hogan, 1986).</page><page sequence="38">38 Kelly In the 1970s, Great Basin archaeology played an important role in North American settlement pattern research. Given the general importance of hunter gatherers to anthropology, and the growing interest in farmer/forager (or farm ing/foraging) interaction, I expect that Great Basin research will continue to play a formative role in North American archaeology well into the 21st century.
