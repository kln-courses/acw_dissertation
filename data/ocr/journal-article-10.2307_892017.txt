By Eric Werner. London: Dennis Dobson; New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1959. [xx, 618 p., music, 8vo; 90/-, $15.00] In 1940 Eric Werner published his "Comparative Study of Catholic and Jewish Musical Punctuation" in the Hebrew Union College Annual. Hardly a year passed during the following dec- ade in which he did not publish an- other important study on the connec- tion between Jewish and Early Chris- tian liturgy, all of them full of new and often daring ideas, documents of a mind of an unusually wide range of knowledge, with a deep insight into the artistic qualities of liturgical poetry and music. The Sacred Bridge is largely based upon these studies. The book is or. ganized in two parts: the first is de- voted to liturgical problems, principally as they are related to those of the liturg- ical chant, the second to cantillation and the chant. This method has its advantages in so far as it permits the author to go into every detail, whether historical, liturgical, or musical. Its dis- advantage is the inevitability of cross- references between the parallel-running chapters, which lead to repetitions. If it had been possible to compress both parts into one, the book would have gained in conciseness, though undoubt- edly many valuable details would have had to be sacrificed. But accepting as necessary the present division, I won- der whether chapter four in Part One, on the Musical Tradition of Lessons and cognate liturgical forms, would not have been better in the second part. What does the title signify? As our colleague and friend the late Curt Sachs explains in the foreword, Judaism and Christianity have a common heritage which underwent decisive changes after the new creed had spread to the Gen- tiles; "a sacred bridge," however, "spans the abyss" which separates Judaism and Christianity "and allows for an ex- change of views and moral concepts and, with them, of liturgical forms in which the dogmas and concepts find their way to the senses." Images, he continues, "are not admitted to the Jewish side, where God and religion were kept in a spiritual sphere" which excludes anthropomorphic representa- tion. Now that most students of art history agree that the famous frescoes in the Synagogue of Dura-Europos are only one link in the chain which was formed by Hellenistic Jews before the beginnings of Christian art, this would seem to be a doubtful hypothesis. W'erner fortunately does not touch upon this question, and I do not suppose that he agreed with his mentor on that par- ticular point. He opens his book with a chapter on the Jewish liturgy at the time of the Primitive Church, and gives a succinct survey of the Jewish service, pointing out particularly those prayers which were taken over by the Church. In the second chapter, "The Liturgical and Musical Traits of the Earliest Christian Community," Werner rightly underlines those features which are common in Temple and Synagogue and were taken over by the early Christians. "The chanting of canticles was much more in evidence in the Temple than in the Synagogue." This statement is confirmed by the fact that the great Ode of Moses (Dt. 32) was sung, divided into six parts, in the Temple. The study of the common traits in lessons and prayer is most welcome at the present moment. During the last 552</page><page sequence="2">few years the improvisatory character of Christian liturgy down to Gregory the Great has been made generally known. The common traits in the lit- urgy, therefore, are the backbone of the Service; of these a large number of examples are given on pp. 31-36. Chap- ters 3 and 4 deal with the Lessons. For the Greek Orthodox Church this in- vestigation had already been made by Rahlfs. Werner extends it to the Roman. Mozarabic, Armenian, Jacobean, and Nestorian rites and arrives at the con- clusion that the tradition of ancient Judaism is "most faithfully preserved in the Latin, Nestorian and Armenian Churches." Divergencies from the old Jewish ritual "are due to Christological, calendaric and dogmatic feasons." In chapters 6 to 9 Werner deals with the liturgical texts set to music, in the tenth with the "Aesthetic and Ethical Evaluation of Music in Synagogue and Church." Most valuable are those parts where Hebrew, Roman, and Byzantine are paralleled, so that their identical texture becomes evident. Part II opens the important study on "The conflict between Hellenism and Judaism" which Werner has already pub- lished in the Hebrew Union College Annual, a brilliant survey, illustrated by many music examples. Unfortunately Werner relies in some of these transcrip- tions on those of other scholars who have dealt too freely with the original texts; thus the famous Oxyrhynchos hymn (p. 339) is given in an unsatisfactory ver- sion, in which one does not realize what parts are missing as a result of gaps in the damaged papyrus. This is the more astonishing in that Werner men- tions in a footnote the correct editions of the music. The chapter on the origin of the eight Modes of Music is of particular interest to students of Western medieval music. Werner accepts the theory of archetypes, first expounded by A. Z. Idelsohn, and stated by me as a principle of composition in Serbian and Byzantine chant. The present reviewer does not feel himself competent to follow the author in his often staggeringly bold hypo- theses, of which the origin of the Oc- toechos in an old Babylonian calendaric system is the most convincing. The theory about the Ogdoas needs further discussion before it can be definitely established whether the music of which the Gnostic Papyri speak is music in a symbolical sense, perceptible only to the initiates, or music which one can hear. The problems Werner raises in the chapter are, however, of paramount importance. It seems that the time has come to study the problem of modality in Western chant in as unbiased a way as is possible for the chant of the Eastern Church. It will put the whole problem on a sound and simple basis. Summing up I should like to say how much musicologists are indebted to Werner for his work. He has achieved an inspired and inspiring work about the foundations of our liturgical music which must be read by every stu- dent of medieval music. Since he is a pioneer in his field, he has had to push far into the jungle; much will have to be done to clear the path he has blazed. But for those who have come in their studies to an abyss and have wondered what to do because they have had no approach to the other side, to Jewish liturgy and music, there is now a firm bridge.
