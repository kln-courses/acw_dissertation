<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Jill M. Parrott Eastern Kentucky University How Shall We Greet the Sun?: Form and Truth  in Gwendolyn Brooks’s Annie Allen Gwendolyn Brooks’s Pulitzer Prize winning poetry collection Annie Allen (1949)  presents glimpses of individuals who have been institutionally lied to: you are not  good enough, you are not smart enough, and you are not worthy of the human rights  to which the rest of us are accustomed. Written in the time immediately before the  Civil Rights push of the 1950s and 60s, Annie Allen rejects the dehumanization of  Blacks in America by paradoxically alluding to Plato and the Western thought that  he represents and that has upheld oppression tacitly (and sometimes overtly) for  centuries. Plato’s “Myth of the Cave” sets the parameters for human fulfillment as an  aggressive pursuit of Truth. Under this definition, dehumanization is an individual,  collective, or institutional act that prohibits another from this aggressive pursuit.  Gwendolyn Brooks uses rhetorical form in Annie Allen to challenge this tenuous  relationship between dehumanization and Western ideology; alluding to Plato allows  her to condemn those who would glorify the pursuit of Truth and fulfillment for  themselves while systematically denying it for others.  Rhetorical theorist Kenneth Burke provides useful parameters of form to  strengthen this thesis. In “The Nature of Form,” Burke suggests that “form in literature  is an arousing and fulfillment of desires. A work has form in so far as one part of  it leads a reader to anticipate another part, to be gratified by the sequence” (183).  Therefore, rhetorical form relies heavily on the creation and fulfillment of readers’  desires, and the desire for fulfillment in reading literature cannot be extrapolated from  form. He categorizes the different kinds of form as follows: syllogistic progression,  qualitative progression, repetitive form, conventional form, and minor or incidental  forms. Syllogistic progression is a “perfectly conducted argument” as one might  find in a mystery or detective story. In qualitative progression, “one incident of  plot [prepares] us for some other possible incident of plot” or “the presence of  one quality prepares us for the introduction of another.” Qualitative progression,  then, relies heavily on the state of mind into which the reader is placed. Repetitive  form is “the restatement of the same thing in different ways”; Burke provides the  example of Swift’s constant reminders that the Lilliputians are small in comparison  to Gulliver (184). Greek tragedies or fairy tales offer examples of authorial use  Style: Volume 46, No. 1, Spring 2012 27 </page> <page sequence="2"> 28 Jill M. Parrott of conventional forms, or forms that the reader has come to recognize or expect,  while the study of minor forms includes analyzing “metaphor, paradox, disclosure,  reversal, contraction, expansion, pathos, apostrophe, series, chiasmus” or other  incidentals that work together to create the whole (185).  By utilizing these definitions, one can see qualitative progression in Annie  Allen in that the poem “truth” places the reader in a state of mind that necessitates  intellectual inquiry, beginning with the minor form of its title and then driven by  the poem’s inextricable allusion to the “Myth of the Cave.” By not capitalizing  “truth,” Brooks suggests subjectivity; “Truth” capitalized as a proper noun would  indicate the absolute objectivity of Plato. Further, the presence of the rhetorical  question in “truth” suggests a relationship between reader and author as Brooks  is not speaking merely at the reader but directly to him and demanding answers.  This relationship sets the framework for the next poem in which Brooks uses the  implicit second person to address the reader as “you.” Therefore, seeing rhetorical  form as the creation and fulfillment of desire, “truth” creates an expectation for  further discussion on the nature of truth and inquiry and other poems fulfill that  expectation; the reader is “gratified by the sequence” (Burke 183). Although the  poem was accepted for publication on its own (but never appeared) for Common  Ground several years before the collection was published, reading the work in its  entirety reveals the qualitative relationships between sections, poems, and minor  forms and a consistent overall form that meets expectations for a criticism of any  Truth that excludes and dehumanizes others (Kent 64).  Brooks would have been familiar with Plato and his texts. Brooks biographer  George Kent reveals that her family owned, read, and even recited from the Harvard  Classics collection, in which works by Plato were included (1, 11). It is also likely  that Brooks encountered Plato through the curriculum of her writing classes as a  popular approach of the time (espoused by Fred Newton Scott) involved a heavy  reliance on Platonic rhetoric and was “widely disseminated . . . . in the high schools”  of America (Berlin 46). “Myth of the Cave” involves a conversation between Socrates  and Glaucon in which Socrates suggests that if individuals were chained inside a  cave and were situated so that their only visual stimulation was shadows upon the  cave’s wall then they would believe those shadows to be reality: “And so in every  way they would believe that the shadows of the objects . . . were the whole truth”  (225). He continues that if these individuals were subsequently released from their  bondage, their eyes would find difficulty accepting reality outside. Socrates says  that if “[the prisoner] were forcibly dragged up the steep and rugged ascent and not  let go till he had been dragged out into the sunlight, the process would be a painful  </page> <page sequence="3"> How Shall We Greet the Sun? 29 one, to which he would much object, and when he emerged into the light his eyes  would be so dazzled by the glare of it that he wouldn’t be able to see a single one  of the things he was now told were real” (225). Scholars have long accepted this  allegory as a scathing critique of ignorance and as the philosopher’s impetus for  educating and leading others to search for truth.  Yet, Plato did not believe in subjective truth. Plato should not be aligned with  the Sophists, who have come to represent philosophical and rhetorical subjectivity,  because he espoused absolute Truth (which I will differentiate from subjective  truth with capitalization). His Theory of Forms explains that absolute perfection  exists in another realm: the chair I am sitting in is not a perfect chair, but only the  faint shadow of “The Chair” in the Realm of Forms. Plato’s belief that absolute  perfection exists and should be sought and that those things that are not good and  perfect should be shunned has affected Western thought by tacitly endorsing racism,  sexism, and classism.  Brooks’s canon, however, rejects absolutism, and the poems of Annie Allen  provide examples of lives lived in intellectual query as a contrast to those that  are not, most notably Annie Allen herself. Using Burke’s definition of qualitative  progression as a framework, the poem “truth” is a facet of the greater work of Annie  Allen through which interpretation of the collection as a whole can be viewed.  The poem’s title—“truth” uncapitalized—indicates a belief in subjective rather  than absolute truth, an idea that challenges traditional Western ideology as well  as the oppressive absolutism of racist thought. By using an allusion to Plato, she  rejects the Western thought that insists on absolute Truth, defines fulfillment as the  pursuit of it, and then denies that pursuit to others. An exploration of the forms  that constitute this collection seen holistically necessarily concludes admiration  for those individuals who are able to reject the dehumanization placed on them by  their surroundings and embrace an alternate truth, thereby rejecting Plato and any  absolutism that oppresses them. Certainly, institutional oppression is a theme of  this work that plays itself out in its progression of form.  Indeed, although Annie Allen was published more than a decade before Brooks  attended the Second Fisk Writer’s Conference in 1967, an experience that turned  Brooks on to the “new black consciousness,” “truth” shows us an inkling of her  future political consciousness. Brooks biographer George Kent reveals that Annie  Allen marked a time in her career from whence forth she would always be considered  “the first Negro to win a Pulitzer Prize” and as a “spokeswoman and arbiter in the  upper realms of her city’s and her nation’s cultural affairs” (102). After winning, she  was asked to speak publicly on racial affairs, which she declined “feeling that she  </page> <page sequence="4"> 30 Jill M. Parrott was not good at expressing herself orally” (89). Although Annie Allen is actually  less overtly racial in tone and content than some of her other works (as Kent points  out), her role as a person of importance in race relations in this country drastically  blossomed with its publication, popular acceptance, and Pulitzer Prize.  Surely this growing push to encourage Brooks to become a spokesperson for  the Black, female poet played no small part in her later adjustments in perspective  as it came to race and art in America. Karen Jackson Ford explains in her essay  “The Sonnets of Satin-Legs Brooks” that after the 1967 Conference “nearly every  form in which [Brooks] had excelled—sonnet, ballad, iambic pentameter, epic and  finally lyricism itself—was explicitly or implicitly repudiated as ‘white writing’”  (348). Indeed, a tension always existed between Brooks’s focus on form and her  subject matter. Through Brooks was not writing sonnets after 1967, Ford claims  that “what unites rather than divides Brooks’s poetic career is precisely this: an  anxiety about form, a persistent question about the appropriateness of art in political  and social struggle” (350, 348). Brooks scholar Jenny Goodman agrees that Annie  Allen “anticipates the cultural moment of Black Arts and Black Nationalism in  Brooks’s self-consciousness” and that her later work also alludes back toward  Brooks’s preceding aesthetic (176, 173). Brooks herself acknowledged in a 1983  interview that poems from both supposed eras of her writing are politically aware  (qtd. in Goodman 160). Annie Allen brings these ideas into pointed conversation  as its form serves as a means of illuminating political aspects of her content.  For example, although Annie Allen presents Brooks’s vision of the Western epic,  it also shows a rejection of Western ideology in its representation of enlightenment  coming from classic Plato as it presents a similar allegoric image but a dissimilar  ideological message. Like Plato’s myth, the poem interrogates the relationship  between “sun” and “shade,” truth and ignorance (lines 1, 6). She suggests that  those individuals accustomed to “shade” will “shudder” at the sun, wanting instead  “the familiar / Propitious haze” (lines 6, 14, 17-18). The poem concludes with the  statement “The dark hangs heavily / Over the eyes” (lines 22-23). The similarities  in the narrative lines are striking. Like Plato, Brooks suggests trepidation on the  part of those individuals in the shadows concerning the enlightening sun. Just as  it is a painful experience for dark-accustomed eyes to adjust to the sunlight, it is  also painful for those minds accustomed to an ideology of ignorance or evil to face  enlightenment. One must acknowledge how African Americans in the United States  must have found—and still do find—it challenging to confront racist attitudes. The  “dark” that “hangs heavily / Over the eyes” here is certainly also dependent upon  the dark colors of Brooks’s addressed community for meaning.  </page> <page sequence="5"> How Shall We Greet the Sun? 31 Brooks, in fact, speaks directly to the members of the African American  community who for so long had been denied adequate access to education, healthcare,  participation in democracy, and more and requires that they confront the situation  through a type of apostrophe, a rhetorical trope that Burke labels as a minor form.  Her tone in this form is both sympathetic and biting because Brooks is involved in  this situation: throughout Annie Allen “the shift from first-person singular . . . to first  personal plural is significant” as it addresses Blacks and is, in fact, “most fruitfully  read as addressed to African Americans” (Goodman 175). The first stanza demands  answers while simultaneously acknowledging the complicated psychological place  of the Black community:   And if the sun comes  How shall we greet him?  Shall we not dread him,  Shall we not fear him?  After so lengthy a session with shade?  With the use of “we,” Brooks claims connection to the group of people to whom  she speaks—her addressees in the apostrophe. She is incriminated in the darkness  as much as anyone is; she is an insider. Yet, she is also an outsider because she has  the ability to step outside the darkness at least enough to question its validity and  recognize its numbing powers. This content becomes meta-commentary in that she is  a Black/dark woman writing in what she would later perceive as White/light forms.  This double-meaning is at work in many of Brooks’s uses of apostrophe  throughout her canon. Brooks scholar Barbara Johnson describes apostrophe  as “both direct and indirect” (185). Johnson further says, “the absent, dead, or  inanimate entity addressed is thereby made present, animate, and anthropomorphic.  Apostrophe is a form of ventriloquism through which the speaker throws voice, life,  and human form into the addresses, turning its silence into mute responsiveness”  (185). Her commentary suggests that, unlike Plato’s ignorant individuals, African  Americans are aware of the things from which they have been kept. A both/and  existence allows her to address her audience with a heightened sense of awareness  that she wishes to extend.   In the second stanza, Brooks highlights this distinctive viewpoint that separates  her from Plato’s trajectory in “The Myth of the Cave”: she suggests knowledge  of the sun, even in the darkness. Although Plato’s prisoners have only the reality  of the cave, Brooks’s shade inhabitants know the sun beyond their reality exists  and—most importantly—desire the sun. She says, “Though we have wept for [the  sun] / Though we have prayed / All through the night-years” (lines 7-9). This sharp  </page> <page sequence="6"> 32 Jill M. Parrott contrast between complete ignorance and unfulfilled desire is important because  those who live in Brooks’s “dark” world do not need to be informed. Surely, how  could any Black person in America in the 1940s be unaware of the existence of  White hegemony around her? Black people in America did not need to be told that  they were denied access to things that were available to others, that in many ways  they were denied their humanity, that they were being kept in the dark. They also  do not need motivation as they exhibit motivation in their weeping and praying.  What they need, as Brooks shows, is the volition to act. In “Heralding the Clear  Obscure,” critic Lesley Wheeler says, “Brooks’s poetry enacts a tension between  the lyric convention of isolate interiority and the poem’s status as public speech”  (224). Brooks takes the role of community leader both by including herself in the  “we” and by making her queries an act of public speech that instigates agency in  the African American community.  Certainly, the reader can interpret this text as making a cultural statement about  the Civil Rights movement in America. Originally published in 1949, Annie Allen  occurred near the pinnacle of frustration and anger for many Blacks in America,  when “all the dead weights” of the racial struggle heavily burdened the national  environment (Plato 228). America was on the cusp of a generation that would  change America ideologically, physically, and economically. “truth” presents a  scathing critique of fear, ignorance, and inaction in the Black community of the  early Twentieth Century of which Brooks was a part as well as the white literary  community by whom she was praised. Wheeler says that Brooks “forced her  version of the lyric to become a public forum, to sustain the marks of and even  participate in political struggle” (227). Brooks’s critique is a call to action in her  readers, and “the question of audience is of vital concern in Brooks’s poetry”  because she wants to reach the audience at a place that allows for comprehension  and reaction, particularly in the context of racial struggles in America (227). The  white literary community who praised her was certainly familiar with Plato; she  uses that familiarity and manipulates it to reveal its hypocrisy in that although privy  to the sun, African Americans are denied its experience in public.  As the poem continues, the elements needed for qualitative progression  strengthen as Brooks’s tone becomes more cutting and sarcastic both towards people  who claim ignorance in the face of rampant dehumanization and people who tacitly  accept the hegemonic force placed upon them: “Sweet is it, sweet is it / To sleep  in the coolness / Of snug unawareness” (lines 19-21). The image invoked might  be one of a babe asleep in its crib, enjoying sweet ignorance. The image becomes  bitter, though, because Brooks addresses adults who are, in fact, not “unaware,” for  </page> <page sequence="7"> How Shall We Greet the Sun? 33 they have “wept” and “prayed” to be released from the shadows and to assume the  rights they deserve or conversely have chosen the willful ignorance of a ruling class.  To answer the expectation centralized in “truth,” throughout Annie Allen  Brooks rebukes those who allow that fear and ignorance to cripple them in the  path toward the enlightenment and existence for which they have “wept” and  “prayed.” Brooks calls for action, volition, will, and inquiry throughout the text.  Jenny Goodman asserts that “the organization within and among the collection’s  three individually titled parts strongly suggests that a full appreciation of the text  requires one to read it as more than a loose collection of individual poems” (166).  An example of Brooks’s appeal to action moving out of “truth” can be found in  the poem immediately following:  Exhaust the little moment. Soon it dies.  And be it gas or gold it will not come Again in this identical disguise.  In this short work, rhythm and brevity work together to point toward the effect of  fleeting moments, the perpetual changing of context inherent to existence. Brooks’s  tone changes for this poem as she no longer asks rhetorical questions or points out  hypocrisies but rather makes a command. The implicit second person subject of  the first line—(You must) “exhaust the little moment”—draws the subject of her  apostrophe to the author. The theme of these two poems seen together provides  ample foundation to view Annie Allen as, at least in part, a reflection on a need to  act immediately against the dehumanizing rejection of human rights.  As this progression moves through the text, the character of Annie is the  most marked representation of a person condemned by Brooks for her inability  to reach actively beyond her own subjective reality created by the oppression of  her situation as a dark-skinned person in a world controlled by the light-skinned.  Indeed, her Blackness separates her from the white community’s ideals of beauty,  intelligence, and morality (standards not unlike those of Plato’s Realm of Forms).  Claudia Tate’s essay “Anger So Flat” hypothesizes about Brooks’s concern with  action versus inaction. The middle section of Annie Allen entitled “The Anniad”  alludes to The Illiad, yet another exemplar of the Western tradition. Tate suggests  that the epic form, what Burke would call a conventional form because the audience  easily recognizes it as epic, is satiric for Brooks. Similar to the allusion to Plato,  the allusion to The Iliad draws attention to the cultural tradition Brooks subverts.  Tate says, “By using satire, Brooks does not have to engage in a severely direct  and explicit form of censorship. The form inherently ridicules . . . By relying on  this literary form, Brooks uses it to communicate not only emotional content, but  </page> <page sequence="8"> 34 Jill M. Parrott also social and moral criticism” (150). Tate is most concerned with the role of  women in Annie Allen reflecting the reality of women of the time. In fact, most of  Brooks’s main characters are women, suggesting that she places a heavy burden  on women in the community to act. Critic John Gery also reflects on gender roles  in his article “Subversive Parody in the Early Poems of Gwendolyn Brooks.” He  says, “Brook’s parody is less of an ordered world to be disturbed [as parodies often  reflect] than of a disturbed world that needs ordering” (46). Brooks shows Annie  Allen as a woman who is at odds with her own life because she denies her own  humanity in exchange for the feminine role prescribed to her by her society. This  role emphasizes how the virgin knight of whom Annie dreams contrasts the female  and male roles. Annie gives her knight characteristics that she does not or cannot  exhibit herself: “fullness of character and the will to act” (Tate 147).   Throughout “The Anniad,” Brooks presents Annie as someone of weak will  who is humbly unassertive and because, as Claudia Tate suggests, “The Anniad” can  be viewed as satirical, making Annie a mock-hero and not someone to be admired,  the attributes of unassertiveness and low volition are undesirable for Brooks in the  parameters of this narrative, and we can expect through qualitative progression to  see further commentary on this topic throughout. Annie is as flat as her processed  hair and “remains sweet, good, and polite, believing that these virtues alone will  ultimately merit her happiness. Therefore, in the face of turbulent domestic activity,  Annie remains virtually inert and exhibits no perceivable emotional response”  (147). Wheeler affirms this interpretation: “the discipline of form [in the mock epic]  demonstrated by Brooks duplicates the discipline of meek and obedient femininity  imposed on Annie” by the same society that valorizes intellectual inquiry as the  ideological descendents of Plato (230). While I do not suggest that Brooks condemns  sweetness, goodness, or politeness, she indicates that choosing those qualities in  the stead of challenging your own institutionalized subjugation is not admirable.  That this is the life of Annie Allen is hardly surprising, however, because of the  characterization of her parents we receive. In “the parents: people like our marriage,  Maxie and Andrew,” Brooks describes the lackluster life of the parents. In addition to  this text, the minor form of the collection most active in “the parents” is the repetition  of adjectives because they overwhelm this portion of the text and work together  to create the disappointed tone of the piece. This list seen together—“clogged,”  “soft,” “sloppy,” “pleasant,” “white”—suggest an unfulfilled, bland life. Other  descriptive techniques support this feeling as well: they have “lost the light that  bites or terrifies” (line 2). This line becomes acutely attractive when seen in light of  (pun intended) “truth.” In “truth,” the sun’s light is frightening but desirable. In “the  </page> <page sequence="9"> How Shall We Greet the Sun? 35 parents,” Maxie and Andrew are so deeply entrenched in ignorance and darkness  that they have completely lost that light. This loss reflects not only the absence of  light but also a deep-seeded rejection of it that is no longer an act of will. Their  ignorance and existence in the shadows is firmly resolute. They exemplify those  members of the African American community who have been oppressed for so  long, generation by generation, that they accept the Truth given to them that they  are not worthy of the same experience of humanity given to others. The irony is  that the systematized Truth presented to them is, in fact, a lie.   As in other poems throughout the collection, Brooks uses the minor form  of apostrophe to address her audience and involve it in the narrative. While Wheeler  argues that apostrophe is “an address to the absent,” for Brooks apostrophe can  also work to make her audience present and active—decidedly not absent (228).  She gains influence by making her addressee part of the narrative and a decision- maker in the world out of which the narrative was constructed. The line “Watch  for porches as you pass” gives a feeling of motion or propulsion forward; narrative  action is passing, but the parents are sitting still (line 7). They “sit behind / The  white Venetian blind” and are as interesting as “Pleasant custard” (lines 10, 9).  Knowing that the Allens are people who “settled” for accepting their subjugated  context and resolutely “shut the door,” it is not surprising that Annie also is a person  of inaction (line 4).  As a challenge to the parents, who have accepted the dehumanization of the  shadows, Brooks provides examples of individuals we should admire for their  contrasting tenacity and full, spirited lives. The opening to Annie Allen, “Memorial  to Ed Bland,” uses the conventional form of the elegy to honor one such person. Ed  Bland—a black soldier who died during World World II and was also a poet, critic,  and friend of Brooks—has been “killed in Germany March 20, 1945; / volunteered  for special dangerous mission / . . . wanted to see action . . .” (Kent 55; lines 1-3). He  is not afraid to assert himself. In fact, he seeks ways to be adventurous. Ed’s surname,  Bland, becomes an ironic pun because Ed was decidedly not bland. He sought action  and vivacity in his life, and he refused to accept his own dehumanization. Kent  tells us that Edward Bland the person focused on the “interaction between social  forces &amp; literature” in his own criticism (55). The poem continues to describe Ed  as someone who was “curious” even as a child. Ed Bland is someone who deserves  a memorial because he embodies those qualities that the parents lack: “curiosity,”  “surprise,” “awe,” and “[wonderfulness].” Because of his positive qualities, he is  a person others admire, who inspires change, and who refuses to acquiesce to his  context. Ed Bland volunteers for a dangerous mission not because he morbidly  </page> <page sequence="10"> 36 Jill M. Parrott desires death but because he does not fear death because his life is fulfilled in his  constant, willful interaction with it.  Brooks also juxtaposes death and fulfillment in “the rites for Cousin Vit,” a  sonnet that provides another example of an individual whose life was full of action  and interaction and whom the narrator valorizes after her death. In “Memorial to  Ed Bland” and “the rites for Cousin Vit,” Brooks provides images of individuals  not reduced to obedience to Truth but rather demand their own truth. In order to  effectively challenge hegemony and its mechanizations of racism, Brooks must show  potential in the Black community for the aggressive pursuit of those things they have  been denied, effectively negating the ideological viewpoint of the power structure  that Blacks neither have the potential for nor the rights to such fulfillment if they  so desire. Vit has so much fight in her that she seems to carry her fiery personality  after her death: the casket “can’t hold her” (line 2). The narrator, again speaking  in the second person imperative, insists, “Even now, [you] surmise, / She rises in  the sunshine” (lines 5-6). The narrator demands that readers focus our attention  on how even in death, she “rises,” she acts, and she has agency. Further, she rises  in the light, not the dark.  Cousin Vit’s life is full of activities that one might call “shady.” She dances, she  drinks, and she talks about inappropriate topics. Admittedly, Vit is not described as  completely fulfilled as before her death she was only “on the verge / Of happiness”  (lines 13-14). Yet, at least she was “on the verge” of fulfillment and heads in the  right direction away from being bogged down by oppressive context. In the final  word of the poem, Brooks presents a pointed portrayal of Cousin Vit. She “Is.” She  “Is.” with capitalization, full stop period punctuation, and complete sentence power.  This two-letter utterance set aside represents her very being. It is a monument to  her existence and a testament to her humanity and vitality, as her name suggests.  As Michel Foucault suggests in The Archaeology of Knowledge, the statement is  the “atom of discourse” and the very building block on which all language and  power exists (1446). Brooks taps into that atomic energy issuing a terse statement  pregnant with meaning. That one word contrasts Annie Allen, who makes one  “Think of sweet and chocolate,” and Vit, who “Is.” (“The Anniad” line 1, “the rites  for Cousin Vit” line 14). This formal dexterity is key to understanding Annie Allen  because “the tension in her poetry between form and subject, especially when they  seem at odds with each other, enhances their resonance” (Gery 45). Vit is dead, but  Brooks uses the traditional form of the sonnet to contrast the struggle against that  tradition African American individuals must exert. This struggle is paradoxically  </page> <page sequence="11"> How Shall We Greet the Sun? 37 awesome for its effort and shameful for American society because of the oppressive  context that necessitates it.  John Gery suggests that this final word represents a disjunction between action  and being, but I respectfully disagree. He suggests this sentence is a “subjectless  predicate,” thereby negating Vit’s existence as an acting agent. He continues: “While  Vit’s spirit powerfully and indisputably mocks the behavior of those (of whatever  stripe) who lead conventional lives, the curt and ironic assignment of ‘is’ to one who  is, after all, dead obliquely mocks the speaker herself for fantasizing Vit as vital . . .  Brooks’s parodic, self-conscious humor . . . [acknowledges Vit’s] oppressive social  condition” (53). I concede that Vit’s death is a recognition of and possibly a direct  outcome of her life—a life in which social context forces an individual to seek  out alcohol and sex as a form of uninhibited escape is not to be coveted. However,  rather than seeing that final image of existence as disjointed from agency, I see it  as the outcome of her agency in that even after her death she continues to exist in  those lives with whom she interacted. “Is.” does not represent ambivalent being. It  represents a contrast between Vit and those who lead conventional lives because  their inactive conventionality negates their existence and extends the qualitative  progression of the text. They are not even when alive, while Vit “Is.” even when  dead. Gwendolyn Brooks confirmed this interpretation in a 1961 interview. She  says that Vit is based on a person she knew, a person “who had that impressibility  that seems unconfinable even in death.” The interviewer, Studs Terkel, asks: “In  this, the irrepressibility, the irrepressibleness of your Cousin Vit . . . you might say  Vit conquers death really. Is that what you’re saying there?” Brooks responds, “In  a way, yes” (8).  Through these previous contrasting images of vivacious life and gelatinous life,  Brooks provides hope for the next generation. In “The Womanhood,” “she explicitly  identifies the voice of the poet with the voice of the mother” (Wheeler 229). The  child in section II of “The Womanhood” has a natural desire for knowledge, and  Annie seems to inherit that desire from her child, a move that Burke would call the  minor form of reversal. The narrator indicates that the existence of her child and  her interaction with that child provides inspiration because he has not yet come to  understand the oppressiveness of racism in America. He is still the babe in “truth”  sleeping in “snug unawareness” (“truth” line 21). She says of this yet untainted child:  Life for my child is simple, and is good.  He knows his wish. Yes, but that is not all.  Because I know mine too. And we both want joy of undeep and unabiding things.  (lines 1-4) </page> <page sequence="12"> 38 Jill M. Parrott These and the following lines introduce the characters as childish, albeit active.  They want to kick, tip, snatch, and finger. However, in the center of the poem, the  narrator takes a turn and repeats the minor form found in “Cousin Vit,” saying  “No.” Like the abrupt and biting “Is.,” “No.” demands attention because of its  brevity. Instead of including a comma after “no” indicating a slight transition  into the next thought, “No.” forces a pause before the shift to come. That shift is  important because the narrator forces the realization that although the previously  listed desires seem childish, there is a deeper philosophical desire guiding them.  The innocence of childhood is part of human experience and because the mother  understands that the suffocating inhumanity of the American environment of the  1940s might steal that from her child, she wants to embrace it while they both can.  The remainder of the poem elaborates on the admirable qualities the child  possesses, all of which embody an intense desire for inquiry and experience. The  shift continues with “It is that he has never been afraid” (line 10). Not only does  the tone and focus change in these middle lines but the perspective as well. The  poem is no longer in the first person plural “we” but the third person singular “he,”  indicating that the narrator no longer includes herself in the category because she  cannot say of herself that she “has never been afraid.” Her life experiences have  caused her to fear, and she admires the fearlessness in her child that allows him  to be confident and successful: “Not that success, for him, is sure, infallible. But  never has he been afraid to reach” (lines 15-16). The narrator is not enamored  by her son’s perfection but by his willingness to try. To return to the overarching  metaphor that Brooks and Plato share, he is not content to sit in the shadows and  is not afraid to bear the painful transition into the sunlight, but he also has not had  the experiences that might cause him to fear it—poverty, imprisonment, or mental  and physical harm.  Because this poem is in the final section of Annie Allen entitled “The  Womanhood,” the narrator is Annie Allen herself observing her child. Throughout  the collection, Annie Allen shows a respect for and admiration of people who have  no fear and have a spirit of intellectual and experiential inquiry.  Through Burke’s  qualitative progression, one could read “truth” as Annie pushing her child to lead  a life dissimilar from her own because, although she inhibits her own volition, she  highlights action in others. Each of these poems provides an image of reaction in the  African American community to their dehumanization by a society that insists on its  own Truth. Annie’s parents internalize this oppression while Ed Bland and Cousin  Vit reject it. The child, however, presents a thus far innocent and hopeful vision of  humanity.

Annie Allen is not lazy, but she is afraid and is inhibited by her social  context because “The dark hangs heavily / Over the eyes” (“truth,” lines 22-23).  Brooks does not invalidate the racially strained context out of which these characters  come. In fact, she acknowledges and respects its power. She merely rejects the  absolute Truth of its tenets and ramifications.  To search for Truth is to search for something higher than oneself and perfect,  as Plato’s Realm of Forms suggests. However, to embrace “truth” is to demand  acknowledgement of your own humanity in the very context where you exist.  Through qualitative progression, minor forms, and conventional forms, the pieces  in Annie Allen work together to show a theme of praise for those individuals who  seek the painful sunlight of humanity and disdain and sadness for those who do not.  Annie Allen is a tragic character because she exhibits those qualities she despises.  If we view “The Anniad” as an epic, however satirical, Annie’s tragic flaw is her  timidity of character, passed down to her by generations who have “lost the light.”  In fact, “The work becomes an emotionally charged satirical comment about the  tragedy of a woman’s inactive life, a tragedy compounded by racial prejudice”  (Tate 150). Yet, Brooks also presents hope by addressing readers directly through  apostrophe, and she places power in their hands to do something. Gery tells us  that “the power of parody,” as he constructs Annie Allen, comes “from our implicit  realization that, because any identity can be destabilized, whole new identities might  also arise, initiating the possibility of the reconfiguration of cultural meaning. We  take pleasure in parody because the parodied identity of others instills hope for  change in ourselves” (47). Annie Allen is social commentary and, particularly with  “truth” as a centerpiece, a call for the readers to change themselves and, therefore,  the subjective reality of the context of the dehumanization of Blacks in America.  The collection achieves this goal, or—using Burke’s framework meets  expectations—by using formal choices to guide attention. Meaning is created in  minor forms such as titles (“truth” and “Memorial”), sentence structure (“No.”,  “Is.”), and perspective (first-person plural “we” and third-person singular “he”).  Seen alone, these minor forms are important to their individual poems, but viewed  through the lens of the greater work as a whole, they become essential to a deeper  understanding of the work and its formal structure. Further, the conventional forms  of epic “The Anniad,” elegy in “Memorial to Ed Bland,” and sonnet in “the rites of  Cousin Vit” focuses attention on the ways form and meaning interact as they exhibit  traditional form while simultaneously providing a pointed social commentary about  traditional Western ideology concerning women, economics, and race relations.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 40 Jill M. Parrott Most importantly, however, the qualitative progression we see as we move  through various celebrations of individuals is harvested from “truth.” The opening  poem, “Memorial to Ed Bland,” valorizes individuals who show a courageous desire  to seek out truth rather than let life pass by, as Maxie and Andrew do. Because of  this preparation for progession, “truth” can be seen as a call to action. Through the  formal rhetorical choices Brooks makes, she “gradually constructs a poetic that  demands active, collaborative audiences” (Wheeler 228). The interrogatory tone of  the poem demands the addressee answer the questions and be able to account for  these answers. Indeed, “A question is itself an action. To ask a question is to issue  a challenge” (Hedley 129). The compilation of these forms requires the audience’s  interrogation of self: How shall I greet the sun?
