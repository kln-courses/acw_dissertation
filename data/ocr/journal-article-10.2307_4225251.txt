<plain_text><page sequence="1">J e OURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XVI No. 4 December 1982 Economic Theory and the Problem of Translation Part Two Ken Dennis In Part One (which appeared in the September issue of this journal), I maintained that when scientific argumentation passes from ordinary or natural language into artificial language or symbolic notation, translation is unavoidable, and that ensuring translational adequacy becomes a vital aspect of ensuring the logical rigor of such argumentation. The investigations of Part Two are preliminary in nature, mere recon- naissance missions into a largely unexplored territory. It would be foolish to speculate at this time on the true extent and tractability of that terrain- that is, before more comprehensive surveys are made. All that Part Two offers is a few guidelines as to some of the obstacles that lie ahead. The tentative findings of my investigations can be summed up by section as follows. (1) The method of numerics shows how the numerical-mathematical substructures of scientific hypotheses can be clearly distinguished from, but at the same time be integrated with, the behavioral content of those hypotheses in a single logical framework. (2) The far more challenging part of translation emanates not from the numerical-mathematical sub- structures but from the behavioral content, particularly with regard to pro- positional attitudes that enter into the understanding of the notion of ra- The author is Assistant Professor of Economics, University of Manitoba, Winni- peg, Canada. 1039</page><page sequence="2">1040 Ken Dennis tionality. (3) The idea of homomorphic similarity between numerical and empirical relational structures, as developed in the theory of measurement, does not provide the answer to the problem of translation. Part Two: Some Further Investigations The Method of Numerics The purpose of this section is not the grandiose one of developing a method of translation that will meet all the needs of mathematical eco- nomics, but rather a more modest one of showing how we can both dis- tinguish between and yet integrate the numerical and behavioral content of scientific hypotheses in a unified logical framework. As an introductory exercise, I shall examine what is perhaps the first explicit use of functional notation in economic theory, A. A. Cournot's formula for the simple demand relationship, D = F(p) [Cournot 1838, p. 47]. What exactly does this formula express? Does it express the simple demand hypothesis itself, and if so, what exactly is that hypothesis? Since it is not customary at the present time for theorists to provide com- plete translations for entire formulae (but rather only partial translations for individual symbols), we must re-construct such a translation from the individual parts. The two symbols 'p' and 'D' are naively construed as va- riables for the price asked by sellers of a typical commodity and the quan- tity demanded of that commodity by buyers, while the symbols '=F( )' might be loosely rendered as 'is a function of,' so that what emerges as the verbal translation of 'D = F(p)' is something like this: 'The quantity of a commodity demanded by buyers is a function of the price of that com- modity asked by sellers.' (There is, of course, usually a ceteris paribus proviso accompanying this formulation of the hypothesis.) To see what is defective about this kind of naive translation, we can go one step further by specifying a numerical form for the function and de- riving from it a typical inference: in symbols literary interpretation (naive translation) of symbols spl: Q = 100 - 2P Ipi: If the price of a commodity asked by sellers is some number of units of currency, then the quantity demanded of the commodity by buyers is one hun- dred minus the product of two and that number. sp2: P = 5 lp2: Sellers ask a price of five units of currency. sci: Q = 90 Icl: Buyers demand a quantity of ninety units of the commodity.</page><page sequence="3">Theory and Translation 1041 Whether or not this example is a caricature of modern practice, it is important to recognize some of the many things wrong with the transla- tions given. First, while sp2 and scl express identities (equalities), their literary counterparts lp2 and Icl do not; they may be literary translations but they are certainly not literal translations of sp2 and scl. Second, even though we want 'P' and 'Q' to serve as variables in spl, they in fact turn out to be constants (identical to specific numbers) in sp2 and scl. Variables are not unknown constants [Rosser 1953, p. 82]. What we require is not the solving of the values of two unknown constants but the instantiation of variables with constants, a distinction corresponding to that between general and singular propositions. Third, the symbols 'P' and 'Q' are treated ambiguously not merely as both constants and variables, but also as names (or pronouns) for both numbers and some other kind of entity such as empirical magnitudes or perhaps even events. (The appeal to homomorphism to justify this ambiguity is discussed in the final section.) How can we rectify this situation? By asking at the outset what the formula 'D = F(p)' or 'Q = f(P)' means, we are putting the cart before the horse. Scientific thought begins in ordinary language, and we should begin by asking: What is the demand hypothesis and how should we for- mulate it rigorously for scientific and theoretical purposes? The problem of translation does not commence with a symbolic notation already before us: we develop an appropriate symbolic notation in response to our origi- nating scientific questions. To begin with common parlance, what the simple demand hypothesis asserts is that the amount buyers of any commodity will demand depends (among other things) upon the price sellers ask for that commodity. How do we go about expressing this formally? Pre-translational analysis, or what W. V. Quine calls "regimentation" [Quine 1960, chap. 5], is required to determine the logical structure of the hypothesis. First of all, the locution "depends upon" refers to the idea of functional correspondence that occurs in most scientific hypotheses. So, to translate the demand hypothesis into some suitable notation calls for an under- standing of functions. A function is nothing more than a special kind of set of ordered pairs (or ordered n-tuples for multivariate functions). Thus, a single-valued numerical function f, with domain D and range R, is the set of ordered pairs of numbers of the general form (x;y) -where the symbols 'x' and 'y' serve as variables over the domain and range respec- tively-such that for every value of x in D there exists exactly one value of y in R. For example, suppose we specify the function f by restricting the domain D to the set of integers (3, 4, 5), and by supplying the rule y = 100 - 2x, we generate the corresponding values of y in R as the set of</page><page sequence="4">1042 Ken Dennis integers (94, 92, 90). The function f, then, is quite simply the set of or- dered pairs of integers ((3;94), (4;92), (5;90) ). Functions need not be numerical; the ordered pairs (or ordered n- tuples) may consist of any kind of entity we may choose to specify. More- over, the meaning we give to a function contains no explanation or reason for the correspondence (pairing, n-tupling) of the members of each or- dered pair (n-tuple). That correspondence may be related to some real causal connection or it may be wholly arbitrary. Functions specify cor- respondences; they do not offer explanations. And even though it is usual to specify a function by means of a rule of correspondence, such as y = 100 - 2x, it is not always necessary to do so. We may quite arbitrarily de- fine a function simply by listing the ordered pairs (n-tuples) that com- prise the function, say, for example: g = {(1;105), (2;76), (4;29)}. Beyond the specified correspondences, the function itself is devoid of meaning. Let us revise Ipi so as to read: 'If sellers of a commodity ask a price of x units of currency for the commodity, and if (x;y) belongs to the func- tion f, then buyers demand y units of the commodity.' This version of lpl captures the idea that y (the number of units of the commodity that are demanded) "is a function of" x (the number of units of currency of the price asked by sellers), but lpl expresses more than just the numerical cor- respondence expressed by 'y = f(x).' It states something about the de- pendence of the actions of buyers upon the actions of the sellers. By itself, the numerical function f (specified as, say, y = 100 - 2x, with x and y taking on a range of values) says nothing about economic actions, in fact, nothing of an extra-numerical nature. The same numerical function f could conceivably occur in many different kinds of scientific hypotheses; its sole purpose is to specify a set of numerical correspondences. The task of translation is to associate those numerical correspondences with the economic content of the hypothesis. The next question is: How do we formulate the remainder of the hy- pothesis in such a way as to express the economic or behavioral content (that is, buyers demanding quantities, sellers asking prices) and at the same time link up that behavioral content with the numerical content? Obviously, we need a symbolic notation capable of expressing action statements, and ordinary predicate logic is perfectly capable of doing this. (For readers unfamiliar with symbolic logic, almost any recent textbook on formal logic will suffice for the purposes of this paper, but a good recommendation is [Copi 1965].) The critical step is that of integrating the behavioral with the numerical logic. The method of numerics I outline in this section may not prove to</page><page sequence="5">Theory and Translation 1043 be the ultimate answer to the problem of translation, but it is relatively easy to grasp and is intuitively appealing in that it mimics fairly closely our or- dinary language, and it serves the didactic function of permitting us to explore some of the simpler problems of translation. More than that I will not claim for it. The method is neither philosophically nor mathematically sophisticated. It will not appeal to those of a philosophical inclination, for the liberties it takes in treating numbers are considerable. It certainly does not represent an alternative method for doing the numerical-mathematical portions of theory, for its logical apparatus (the first-order or restricted predicate calculus, re-inforced with an identity predicate) cannot cope with very advanced numerical operations. And even though predicate cal- culus can be translated readily into the much more powerful logical nota- tion of set theory, even the latter has its limitations. Still, the method of numerics is useful at an introductory stage of analysis. The method appeals to our intuitive grasp of numbers in the sense that it begins with ordinary linguistic usage, then seeks to mimic that usage, albeit in a slightly artificial manner, but grammatically correct all the same. Quite essential to the method is the prior recognition and acceptance of the dual role of numbers in our thought processes. In some as yet vaguely understood sense, numbers are deemed to exist as abstract but distinct entities in their own right, independent of space and time. Whether we admit to being Platonists in principle, we are all Platonists in practice whenever we do "pure" mathematics-that is, whenever we treat numbers as separate entities being related to one another in various purely numeri- cal ways or being operated upon in abstract fashion. But we also treat numbers not as substantives (as grammarians would say) but as adjectives describing properties of objects, and it is in this sense that numbers enter into empirical science as part of measurement. Most measurements consist of two components: a numerical term and a mea- suremental term, the latter indicating not only what kind of magnitude is being measured but also which specific magnitude is taken as the standard "unit" of measurement. I shall refer to numbers assigned to measurements as numerics (see [Nidditch 1960, p. 178]). To say that five is the numeric of price (measured in dollars) is simply to say that five is the number assigned to the measurement of price. This duality in the nature of numbers, as both property and object, is philosophically disconcerting, but unless and until we can learn to avoid it, we must learn to live with it, and most of us do so in our non-scientific endeavors. Two things need to be stressed about numerics. First, numerics are indeed still numbers and not some other type of entity; they are merely numbers considered in the context of measurement. Second, whenever we</page><page sequence="6">1044 Ken Dennis refer to numerics, a standard unit of measurement is either explicitly given or else implicitly understood to exist. It makes no sense to say that five is the numeric of price unless we know the unit of measurement in question. How does the method work? The key is that numerical variables and constants are used as terms occurring in both numerical-mathematical predicates (that is, predicates relating numbers to numbers) and in be- havioral predicates (that is, predicates in which numbers are assigned to measurements). Consider the following symbolic expressions partially translated into prose: 'Px' as 'sellers ask a price of x units of currency for a commodity c,' 'Qy' as 'buyers demand a quantity of y units of commodity c,' and 'Fxy' as 'the ordered pair (x;y) belong to the function f.' These three predicates might be put together and quantified so as to express a very simple version of the simple demand hypothesis, (x) (y) (Px * Fxy D Qy), whose partial translation into English might be: 'For all x and all y, if sellers ask a price of x units of currency for a commodity c, and if the ordered pair (x;y) belongs to the function f, then buyers de- mand a quantity of y units of commodity c.' Notice that this is only a par- tial translation written in a syncopated style because symbols of the special notation have not been completely eliminated. To render the translation complete (and thoroughly pedantic!), we must replace the symbols 'f,' 'x,' and 'y' by their literary names, 'the sixth,' 'twenty-fourth' and 'twenty- fifth letters of the alphabet.' For style and brevity, I shall adopt the prac- tice of leaving constants and variables in their symbolic form, but shall translate all predicates and logical functors (that is, quantifiers, sentence- connectives, etcetera) and shall replace grouping symbols with ordinary literary punctuation marks. The formula (x) (y) (Px * Fxy D Qy) constitutes only the inner kernel of the simple demand hypothesis. A variety of qualifications and elabora- tions are called for in constructing a rigorous version of the hypothesis. Four of these are detailed below. The Single-Valuedness of f. To ensure that the numerical predicate F describes a single-valued functional relation and not a many-valued rela- tion (such as 'greater than'), so that for each value of x in f there exists one and only one value of y such that (x;y) belongs to f, we must stipu- late the following condition, given in both symbolic terms and in partial translation: DFJ: (x) (3y) [Fxy * (z) (Fxz D y = z)] tDFJ: For all x, there exists a y such that (x;y) belong to f and such that for all z, if (x;z) belongs to f, then y and z are identical.</page><page sequence="7">Theory and Translation 1045 The first part of DFI, (x) (3 y) [Fxy . .], states that for all x in f there exists at least one y such that (x;y) belongs to f, while the second part of the formula, (x) ( 3y) [. . . (z) (Fxz D y = z)], states that for all x there exists at most one y such that (x;y) belongs to f, the force of these two conditions jointly being that there exists exactly one such y for each x in f. The Temporal Dimension. Within the broader context of demand theory at large, we want to allow for the possibility of sellers asking a dif- ferent price on different occasions and likewise of buyers demanding dif- ferent quantities in response to different prices on different occasions. To do this, we convert the monadic predicates P and Q (having one variable only) into dyadic predicates (having two variables), making room for a temporal variable t, such that Px and Qy become instead Pxt and Qyt. How should we translate these new expressions? The precise manner in which the temporal dimension can and should be taken into account in economic theory is far too complex an issue to delve into here. So, for convenience, I shall side-step that issue by supposing that market be- havior is rigidly patterned on a fixed time-period basis, with buyers mak- ing known their prices regularly at the beginning of each new time-period and buyers making known their demands during the remainder of each time-period. Hence the following partial translations of Pxt and Qyt sug- gest themselves: 'Pxt' as 'sellers ask a price of x units of currency for commodity c at the beginning of time-period t,' and 'Qyt' as 'buyers demand a quantity of y units of commodity c during time-period t.' The Uniformity of Price: Even though price may vary from one time- period to the next, it is conventional (rightly or wrongly) to postulate price uniformity for any given time-period. Without condoning this stipulation, we can nevertheless easily formulate it as follows: UPC: (t) (x) (v) (Pxt * Pvt D x = v) tUPC: For all t, x, and v, if sellers ask a price of x units of currency and of v units of currency for commodity c at the beginning of time- period t, then x and v are identical. The Ceteris Paribus Clause. Price is only one of the factors believed to influence buyers' demands for a commodity. The specification of a simple demand function, y = f(x), makes sense only if all other factors affecting demand have been assumed to remain unchanged over the time-periods for which the function f has been posited. To render this stipulation ex-</page><page sequence="8">1046 Ken Dennis plicit, we might introduce a new clause, symbolized by CPt, the ceteris paribus clause, which is translated: 'CPt' as 'all factors influencing demand for commodity c other than price remain unchanged for the duration of time-period t.' Note that CPt expresses a quantification ('all factors affecting demand . . .'), which remains implicitly embedded in the predicate CP itself. In a more complete formulation of demand theory, this quantifier could and would be rendered explicit, but need not be so in this introductory exer- cise. Furthermore, it is quite feasible to extend the list of variables affecting demand within the predicate calculus. The numerical functional predicate F would simply become polyadic, incorporating as many new variables as needed, although the symbolic notation would become proportionately more complicated for each new variable added. Finally, the mathematical economist will want to specify the numerical form of the function f, but this will not concern us here. The logical machinery of the simple demand hypothesis, in a modestly rigorous version, consists of the following three components: DHKJ: (t) (x) (y) (Pxt * Fxy * CPt D Qyt) the inner kernel of the demand hypothesis UPC: (t) (x) (v) (Pxt Pvt D x = v) the price uniformity condition DFI: (x) (y) [Fxy * (z) (Fxz D y = z) ] the single-valuedness of f condition These three components can be combined into a single formula expressing the simple demand hypothesis, though some re-lettering of variables is re- quired to avoid conflicting cross-references: DHI: (t) (x) [(3y) {Fxw * (z) (Fxz D w = z)} * (v) (Pxt * Pvt D x = v) * (y) (Pxt * Fxy * CPt D Qyt) ], and this can be partially translated into regimented English as: tDHl: For all t and x, there exists a w such that the ordered pair (x;w) belongs to the function f and such that for all z, if the ordered pair (x;z) belongs to the function f, then w and z are identical, and for all v, if sellers ask a price of both x and v units of currency for commodity c at the be- ginning of time-period t, then x and v are identical, and for all y, if sellers ask a price of x units of currency for commodity c at the beginning of</page><page sequence="9">Theory and Translation 1047 time-period t and if the ordered pair (x;y) belongs to the function f and if all factors influencing demand for commodity c other than price remain unchanged during time-period t, then buyers demand a quantity of y units of commodity c during time-period t. Rather than wincing at this technical monstrosity, we should reflect upon what it reveals. First, it shows that translation of the relatively sim- ple hypothesis that quantity demanded depends upon price asked is no simple matter but that it is feasible. Second, the formula for the temporal- ized inner kernel of the demand hypothesis, (t) (x) (y) (Pxt * Fxy D Qyt), exemplifies the essential logical form of a great number of simple hypotheses throughout science, which, in general terms, can be partially translated as: For all t, x and y, if condition of type A, with measurable property a whose numerical assignment under some system of measurement S is x, occurs at time t (or during time-period t), and if (x;y) belongs to the function f, then condition of type B, with measurable property b whose numerical assignment under some system of measurement S' is y, occurs at time t (or during time-period t). So the method extends to applications beyond the confines of economics. Third, the example illustrates the fact that the numerical and behavioral contents of scientific hypotheses can be perfectly well distinguished from one another and yet properly integrated within one and the same logical framework. The two predicates P and Q express the economic content of the hypothesis while the functional predicate F specifies the pattern of numerical correspondences between the measurable properties of events or conditions referred to by the behavioral clauses. These three predicates are knitted together into the key conditional clause, Pxt * Fxy D Qyt, by virtue of the dual role of numbers such that the numerical variables occur in both numerical and behavioral clauses. But translation can be a very serious business, and before we jump to any premature conclusions, we should recall Quine's warning that even fair translation such as tDHI into DH1 does not aspire to absolute synon- ymy [Quine 1960, pp. 159, 161]. We might well ask at this point: How adequate are the proffered translations of Pxt and Qyt? Grammarians and philosophers alike may object to the fact that while the symbols 'x' and 'y' stand for variables over substantives in Fxy, they serve as parts of descriptions in Pxt and Qyt-that is, in the role of ad- jectives in 'x units of currency' and 'y units of commodity c.' This, of course, reflects the dual role of numbers, as mentioned earlier. If this duality or ambiguity of grammatical role is deemed unacceptable, then one</page><page sequence="10">1048 Ken Dennis might resort to a certain amount of technical maneuvering. The first step is to re-phrase the partial translations of Pxt and Qyt so as to place the variables in a substantive position, like this: 'Pxt' as 'x is a numeric of price asked by sellers of commodity c at the beginning of time-period t,' and 'Qyt' as 'y is a numeric of quantity of commodity c demanded by buyers during time-period t.' These translations suffer on two counts: first, because we must employ the indefinite article 'a' whereas the definite article 'the' seems to be what is called for (that is, 'the numeric of price' rather than 'a numeric of price'); and second, the two translations are rendered in the passive tense whereas active assertions about what buyers and sellers do seem more useful. To meet these possible objections, a second and more elaborate step might be to introduce the use of another logical tool, the definite description, sym- bolized with an inverted iota as '( ? u) (... )' and interpreted to mean 'the individual u such that ....' Thus, Pxt would be analysed into: Spt * x = (?u) (Nup), and Qyt into: Bqt * y = (?v) (Nvq), with the following translations: 'Spt' as 'sellers of commodity c ask a price p at the beginning of time- period t,' 'Bqt' as 'buyers demand a quantity q of commodity c during time- period t,' 'Nup' as 'u is a numeric of price p,' and 'Nvq' as 'v is a numeric of quantity q.' However cumbersome, this more elaborate logical procedure ensures that all variables occupy the roles of substantives; that the action-state- ments about buyers and sellers are in the active tense; and that the nu- merics x and y of prices asked and quantities demanded are unique. DHKI now becomes: DHK2: (t) (p) (q) (3 x) -(3 y [Sptx= (? u) (Nup) * Fxy D Bqt y= (?v) (Nvq)]. If all of the propositions of economic theory were as (relatively!) straightforward as the "simple" demand hypothesis, then the "problem" of translation might well be a very trivial one, and the insistence that theorists provide fully explicit and fairly rigorous translations of the kind</page><page sequence="11">Theory and Translation 1049 laid forth in this section would indeed appear an unreasonably fastidious demand for formal rigor far beyond practical necessity. Unfortunately, such is not the case. The example chosen for study was an unusually simple one involving two pure action predicates (P and Q). The purpose of selecting that example was to show how the behavioral and numerical-mathematical components of a scientific hypothesis can be dis- tinguished from one another and yet integrated into a single logical frame- work; and, if nothing else, that example should cast doubt on the practice of representing naively the complex behavioral conditionals of theory solely by means of numerical-functional formulae such as: y = f(x). (The latter asserts nothing more than that two symbolic expressions, y and f (x), serve as variables for a function f.) In the next section, I proceed beyond pure action-statements into the more challenging regions of economic theory. Rationality and Propositional Attitudes When Kenneth Arrow and F. J. Hahn write that "economic agents may be taken to reach their decisions in the light of what they want and what they can get" [Arrow and Hahn 1971, p. 22], they are referring to the con- cept of rationality, and their phrase "in the light of" alludes to the notion of belief. Rational agents make their decisions on the basis of (1) what they want to achieve, (2) what they believe is feasible (possible), and (3) what they believe is optimal relative to their goals as indicated in (1). Rationality underscores most economic behavior and pervades eco- nomic theory and economic logic. It is precisely the appeal to this notion that makes the task of translation so difficult. To see why, we need a few more technical concepts and devices. Rationality is an immensely rich, complex, and subtle notion, and I certainly will not pretend to offer a com- pletely satisfactory definition of it in this paper. Many of its intricacies will be glossed over in order that others might be put into sharper focus. Broadly speaking, rational action is action that is purposeful, goal- directed, or undertaken with a principle in mind. It entails a pattern of consistency between intention and action. (Insofar as we interpret belief as a type of disposition rather than as a form of action, we must distinguish between rational belief and rational action. I shall be concerned here pri- marily with rationality of action, though belief does enter into the under- standing of the latter.) Because rationality links actions to intentions, any discourse about ra- tional action must inevitably employ expressions involving both (1) modal auxiliary verbs indicating ability, potential or possibility ('can,' 'could,'</page><page sequence="12">1050 Ken Dennis 'may,' 'might') and obligation or compulsion ('must, 'should,' 'ought'), as well as action itself ('does,' 'did'), and (2) a wide variety of locutions re- ferring to what have been described as "propositional attitudes," a phrase originating with Bertrand Russell [1940, p. 210]. In contrast to pure events that are directly observable, propositional attitudes are not directly observable but are imputed to actors and refer to what have been variously termed dispositions, propensities, inclinations, etcetera, or else they involve locutions that combine action with intention. The following list, without any pretense to being comprehensive, is meant to be suggestive and will be adequate for an initial understanding of ra- tionality. The six categories range from the purely dispositional down to the active: (1 ) belief ('believes that' for varying degrees of probability); (2) valuation, or desire, preference, etcetera ('wants to,' 'wishes that,' 'prefers to,' 'prefers that,' etcetera); (3) intention, or purpose, goal, ob- jective, motive ('intends to,' 'intends that,' 'has in mind to,' etcetera); (4) decision, or resolution, promise, etcetera ('decides to'); (5) pursuit or endeavor ('tries to'); and (6) achievement or attainment ('succeeds in,'"manages to,' etcetera) . To summarize, discourse about rational action must be able to distin- guish between the modalities of action, possibility, and obligation, as well as between a host of propositional attitudes such as belief, valuation, in- tention, decision, endeavor, and achievement. Thus, in addition to the reg- ular features of the predicate calculus (terms, predicates, logical functors, and grouping symbols), two more logical devices are needed for rational discourse: (1) modal auxiliary qualifiers, so that if 'Axy' means 'x does y,' then 'CA xy' means 'x can do y' and 'SAxy' means 'x should do y'; and (2) propositional operators, so that 'BxCAxy' means 'x believes that x can do y,' 'WxAxy' means 'x wishes to do y' or 'x wishes that x do y,' and so on for the categories of intention, decision, endeavor, and achievement. Letting the three variables x, y, and z range respectively over the rele- vant sets of rational actors, courses of action (whether actual or possible), and states of affairs (again whether actual or possible), we can discuss the various possible interpretations of rational action with the following elements: basic predicates: 'Rxz' for 'x is rational in action with respect to z' 'Mxyz' for 'y is optimal for x's pursuit of z' 'Axy' for 'x does y' 'Exyz' for 'x brings about z' modal auxiliary qualifiers: 'C-' for 'can' 'S-' for 'should'</page><page sequence="13">Theory and Translation 1051 propositional operators: 'Bx . . .' for 'x believes that...' 'Wx . .' for 'x wishes that . . .' or 'x wants to...' 'Ix . . .' for 'x intends to . . .' or 'x intends that . . .' 'Dx.. .'for 'x decides to ...' 'Tx.. .'for 'x tries to . . .' 'Vx . .' for 'x succeeds in ...' or 'x manages to...' Given these building blocks, a very tentative definition of rational action might be: DefRI: (x) (y) (z) [Rxz_ (IxExz BxCAxy BxMxyz D TxAxy)] tDefRI: For all x, y and z, x is rational in action with respect to z if and only if: if x intends to bring about z and if x believes that x can do y and if x believes that y is optimal for x's pursuit of z, then x tries to do y. This definition has been liberally adapted from Israel Scheffier [1963, p. 93] and it is not without its limitations and drawbacks, but it does serve at least to show how the propositional attitudes of belief, intention and endeavor enter into the meaning of rationality. The predicate M is a logi- cal crutch in this definition, and of course in practice economic theorists will devote most of their efforts to this component in particular, that is, to determine the "optimizing" conditions for any goal. The definition pre- sumes a great deal-for example, that goals are specified as states of affairs (rather than as successfully accomplished actions) -and that for every actor and every goal there exists exactly one optimizing course of action (a condition we can specify in symbols as: (x) (z) [IxExz D (3 y) {BxMxyz * (w) (BxMxyz D w = y) }]), that is to say, in the minds of rational actors. What is more important to recognize in this discussion is exactly what the definition does say and does not say. First, the definition should not be confused with two other kinds of statements. As a definition, it should not be confused with a scientific hypothesis or truth-claim to the effect that all actors are indeed rational, or, in symbols: HypRl: (x) (z) (Rxz). The definition merely serves to indicate what it means to be rational in action. Incidentally, the definition also indicates what it means to be "irrational" in action: If actor a intends to bring about state of affairs s, believes he can</page><page sequence="14">1052 Ken Dennis follow course of action c, and believes that c is optimal in his pursuit of s, then a is not rational in action if he does not try to do c. (In symbols, ',-- Ras' is true if 'IaEas * BaCac * BaMacs* -- TaAac' is true.) Furthermore, the definition DefRI should not be confused with a rule about what rational actors should do. For example, a rule for rational ob- ligation might look like this: RuleRl: (x) (y) (z) (IxExz* BxCAxy* BxMxyz D STxAxy) tRuleRI: For all x, y, and z, if x intends to bring about z and if x be- lieves that x can do y and if x believes that y is optimal for x's pursuit of z, then x should try to do y. It is also worth emphasizing that DefRI states that an actor's behavior is judged rational relative to his intentions and to his beliefs about what is possible and optimal. In other words, the definition does not require that actors be omniscient and omnipotent gods to be rational actors, but allows for the possibility of both errors of judgment as to what is possible (as in cases where 'BxCAxy * -- CAxy' is true) and errors of reasoning as to what is optimal (as in cases where 'BxMxyz * -- Mxyz' is true). In fact, it even allows for errors of execution (in cases where 'BxCAxy * CAxy 0 TxAxy * -- VxAxy' is true). This realistic interpretation of rational action is to be very sharply contrasted with what has all too often become a hol- low and spurious solution to the problems of rational discourse, namely, what H. A. Simon has termed "substantive rationality" as distinct from "procedural rationality" [Simon 1976]. In essence, the difference between these two conceptions of rationality is nothing more and nothing less than the difference between imperfect and perfect knowledge (if, indeed, it is possible to maintain such a distinction at all). With substantive rationality, errors of reasoning, judgment, and execution are ruled out: actors are defined to achieve whatever goals they entertain, or, as Simon interprets it: "Behavior is substantively rational when it is appropriate to the achievement of given goals within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints" [Simon 1976, p. 67]. This interpretation of Rxz amounts to: DefR2: (x) (y) (z) [Rxz = (IxExz * CAxy Mxyz D Axy)] Here, an actor's actions are judged rational (by definition) relative only to his goals and to what is, in some objective sense independent of the actor's own beliefs, possible and optimal. According to DefR2, errors are not</page><page sequence="15">Theory and Translation 1053 deemed to fall within the scope of rational behavior. What DefR2 does is to posit tacitly the existence of some god-like scientific observer who judges what is "really" possible and optimal. The usual criticism about perfect knowledge is that it is unrealistic [Stiglitz 1977; Rothschild 1973, pp. 1284-85], but that objection misses the point to the extent of being misleading. Within the context of human interaction, that is, in situations where human actors possess some mea- sure of free will or control over their own decision-making powers but mutually constrain one another's range of actions by the exercise of that very same free will, any hint of perfect foresight (what is usually implied by perfect knowledge) makes no sense whatsoever. If the consequences of one's own decision to act depend in part upon the decisions of others, there can be no such thing as perfect foresight. Now granted, there is a trivial sense in which we can speak of "perfect knowledge," such as when a student scores 100 percent on a test. But that usage, of course, implies nothing about perfect foresight as to future events. And granted, the condition of perfect knowledge is often defined in a seemingly innocent fashion as "complete" knowledge about "current" conditions. The problem is that this innocent definition is usually aban- doned in application-for example, when knowledge of cost and demand functions is posited as perfect. But to say that economic agents have per- fect knowledge as to the cost and demand constraints facing them is to say that they know perfectly what costs and revenues will be upon their choice of action, in short, that they possess perfect foresight about the future con- sequences of their own decisions. (Compare [Simon 1976, pp. 73-74] on this matter.) Finally, any suggestion that we do not actually postulate that agents possess perfect knowledge but only that they behave "as if" they did pos- sess perfect knowledge (see, for example, [Friedman 1953, pp. 18-22, 36-38, and 40]) is intellectually bankrupt, for how can we understand what it means to behave "as if" perfect knowledge is possessed if we can give no meaningful definition to perfect knowledge in the first place. In short, the postulate of perfect knowledge is not unrealistic but rather non- sensical and the phrase "perfect knowledge" is a piece of gibberish that has lingered altogether too long in the economic literature. There is no alterna- tive but to try to come to grips with the problems posed by procedural rationality. What, then, are those problems that make translation so difficult? I shall mention only two, but there are probably many others that will be en- countered as the task of translation is more rigorously explored.</page><page sequence="16">1054 Ken Dennis The first problem originates with G. W. von Leibniz's principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles: "x = y if and only if every property of x is a property of y, and conversely" [Copi 1965, p. 153]. This principle gives rise in turn to another, the principle of the Substitutivity by Identity: "Given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substi- tuted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true" [Quine 1953, p. 139]. In other words, identity is supposed to permit sub- stitution salve veritate, and the very notion of identity itself is sometimes defined in terms of this property, by quantifying over predicates by treat- ing F as variable: (x) (y) [x = y-(F) (Fx = Fy) ]. Substitution by identity, then, is a very fundamental rule for much of formal symbolic logic. However, following Gottlob Frege's earlier recog- nition [Frege 1892], Quine has highlighted the fact that there are many contexts in which this rule fails to hold (see [Quine 1953, pp. 139ff.; Quine 1960, pp. 142ff.]). One of the major classes of such contexts is rep- resented by constructions involving propositional attitudes. Since Russell had already applied the adjective 'transparent' to those contexts in which substitutivity by identity does hold [Russell and Whitehead 1927, vol. 1, p. 665], Quine decided to call contexts in which that condition does not hold "referentially opaque," because failure of the rule reflects the lack of clarity of reference of the terms occurring in these contexts. A rather dramatic example of Quine's concept of referential opacity is the following argument: (1) CEdipus wished to marry Jocasta; (2) Jo- casta = the mother of CEdipus; therefore (3) CEdipus wished to marry the mother of CEdipus. Here, two (dramatically) true premises yield (by substitution of identical terms) a false conclusion. Economic examples are not hard to find. In perfect competition, (1) sellers seek maximum profits in the long run; (2) maximum profits in the long run = normal profits; therefore (3) sellers seek normal profits. Adam Smith's conten- tion that the individual in a system of perfect liberty is "led to promote an end which was no part of his intention" [Smith 1776, vol. 2, p. 35] attests to the falsehood of conclusion (3). Sellers in perfect competition do not seek normal profits. The argument is invalid because substitution by iden- tity in the context of 'x seeks y' is not logically justifiable, and the same stricture applies to other constructions involving propositional attitudes, such as 'x believes that. . . ,' 'x intends that. . . ,' 'x wishes that...,' etcetera. The contrast between referentially opaque and transparent contexts can be summed up in the following table, where 'Bx-' means 'x believes that . . . ,' M is any predicate, and a and b are any objects predicable of M:</page><page sequence="17">Theory and Translation 1055 Table 1. Referentially Transparent and Opaque Constructions Substitution Referentially transparent Referentially opaque by identity and logically true and not logically true A singular instance Ma * (a = b) Mb BxMa * (a = b) BxMb Existential quantification (3 y) (My * y = b) Mb (3 y) (BxMy * y = b) BxMb Universal quantification (y) (My * y = b) Mb (y) (BxMy * y = b) BxMb Quine went one step further by arguing that "we cannot properly quan- tify into a referentially opaque context," because "quantifiers outside a referentially opaque construction are irrelevant to variables inside the con- struction" [Quine 1953, pp. 148, 150; his emphasis]. If true, Quine's second stricture would be quite drastic in effect, virtually eliminating the possibility of building formal deductive models for rational behavior. For- mulae such as those in the right-hand column of the table would be judged not only not logically true but also not even logically admissible as well- formed formulae. Fortunately, subsequent investigations have cast doubt on this second stricture. The very notion of referential opacity has been shown to be not a very good idea in the first place, and many of the problems Quine saw arising from referential opacity can be sorted out by more carefully "dis- ambiguating" (to use J. M. Bell's term) ambiguous referential patterns (see [Prior 1962; Bell 1973]). Even so, Quine's first stricture still holds. The problem is not that we cannot quantify into contexts such as 'believes that ... ,' etcetera, but rather that having chosen to do so, we must there- upon be prepared to impose formal restrictions upon not only substitution of terms but also upon various other standard rules of transformation in- herited from ordinary sentential and predicate logic. What has happened is that in employing propositional operators such as Bx-, Ix-, etcetera, we are introducing a new kind of sentence struc- ture, sentences containing subordinate clauses, and a whole new set of logical principles must be developed that is appropriate to these new kinds of sentences. This is because not all of the laws of logic for sentential and predicate calculi developed hitherto carry forward into the laws govern- ing human thought processes. For example, there is no good reason to suppose that rational agents are aware of all identity relations, let alone all true statements of logic. And, if that is not already evident, just imagine</page><page sequence="18">1056 Ken Dennis trying to posit complete knowledge of the theory of probability (for pur- poses of making probabilistic rational decisions) when there is as yet no one a priori theory of probability to posit. A few brief examples must suffice here. Suppose that P, Q, R, ... Z are any sentences. It seems quite reasonable to say that belief is distributive through conjunction. In other words, Bx (P * Q * R * . . . Z) should be transformable into: BxP * BxQ * BxR * . . . BxZ. But is belief distributive through disjunction or through material conditionality? That is, does Bx (P v Q) transform into BxP v BxQ, and does Bx (P D Q) transform into BxP D BxQ? And in exactly which contexts is substitution by identity logically acceptable? For example, does the formula Bx [Ma * (a = b) (Mb D P) ] logically entail BxP? In short, before we can do any serious work toward constructing a rigor- ous theory of rational economic behavior, we must articulate a set of logi- cal rules governing subordinate-clause constructions. A second major problem arising from the appeal to rationality and the reference to propositional attitudes lies in the interpretation and logical treatment of the objects of propositional attitudes, that is to say, the things believed, desired, intended, decided upon, sought, and achieved. Philoso- phers are wont to ask: What are these things? And in what sense do these often "unactualized possibilities" (to borrow Quine's phrase) exist? Econ- omists, intent upon asking and answering questions of economic theory, need not concern themselves with the philosophers' ontological queries, so long as these conceptual curiosities can be incorporated successfully within a logical framework. In my crude definition of rationality, DefRI, the propositional opera- tors Bx-, Ix-, and Tx- are followed by subordinate clauses whose vari- ables y and z range over (possible) actions and (possible) states of affairs respectively. Is this pattern necessarily correct? A cursory analysis of theo- retical discourse reveals a variety of different locutions expressing the same proposition. Consider the example of profit maximization postulated as the goal of producers. We can formulate this behavioral premise using at least three different locutions that suggest that the "goal" or object of pursuit is either (1) a physical object of some sort, (2) a performance of an action, or (3) a realization of a state of affairs. Letting 'Qx' mean 'x seeks,' we might have: (1) 'Qxv' for 'x seeks maximum profits' (v rang- ing over physical objects), (2) 'QxAxy' for 'x seeks to maximize profits' (y ranging over actions as before), or (3) 'QxExz' for 'x seeks to bring about a profit-maximizing state of affairs' (z ranging over states of affairs as before).</page><page sequence="19">Theory and Translation 1057 This malleability of ordinary language may seem advantageous in sim- ple examples, but the choice of an appropriate phraseology may become quite treacherous in more complex analyses. Just imagine the difficulty in devising a suitable paraphrase for the following proposition: x seeks to set price and output at such a level that x's marginal revenue equals x's marginal cost. When modern economic theory, with its elaborate and sophisticated numerical sub-structures and its naive translation of individual symbols, is reviewed in the light of the problems investigated above, the aura of logical rigor that now surrounds it will appear more than a little questionable. If translation does prove feasible, it is highly unlikely that the solutions will be simple ones. Homomorphism or Mathomorphism? During the past two or three decades, pioneering advances have been made in the theory of measurement. In the modern literature, attention has focused not on the precise description of the actual empirical operations carried out in the act of measuring, but instead upon "the construction of homomorphisms (scales) from empirical relational structures of in- terest into numerical relational structures that are useful" [Krantz et al. 1971, p. 9]. The relational concepts of isomorphism and homomorphism (roughly speaking, "structural identity" and "structural similarity") are appealed to in justifying "the direct application of computational methods to the results of measurement" [Luce and Suppes 1968, p. 72]. Thus, in the formula: a + b = c, the letter 'c' can be considered both the empirical result of measurement when rods of lengths a and b are concatenated (laid end to end) and the result of numerical computation whereby the abstract numerical operation of addition is performed upon the numbers a and b to yield c. A very important consequence of isomorphism between empirical and numerical relational structures is that "once two systems have been identi- fied as isomorphic it is customary even to adopt the same symbolism for both systems" [Deskins 1964, p. 64; my emphasis added]. We have here a very sophisticated rationale for the use of numerical algebras to explore and characterize certain properties of empirical relation systems. But does the theory of measurement thereby offer a solution to the problem of trans- lation? For some, the temptation to believe so will seem almost irresistible, especially when investigators such as David H. Krantz et al. advance claims to the effect that the results of the mathematical foundations of</page><page sequence="20">1058 Ken Dennis measurement "warrant our attention primarily as empirical theories-as attempts to formulate properties that are observed to be true about certain qualitative attributes" [Krantz et al. 1971, p. xvii]. But what do the central findings of the theory of measurement amount to? What exactly are "empirical relational structures," and exactly what kinds of properties or attributes do theories of measurement formulate about these empirical relational structures? If it turns out that the theory of measurement does not provide solutions to the problem of translation, this should come as no surprise, for that body of theory was not originally conceived to answer translational ques- tions. It was designed to address quite another issue, "to explain why some attributes of objects, substances, and events can reasonably be represented numerically" [Krantz et al. 1971, p. xvii; my emphasis added]. Krantz et al. indicate that it is this problem of representation that lies at the heart of their investigations: "When measuring some attribute of a class of objects or events, we associate numbers (or other familiar mathematical entities, such as vectors) with the objects in such a way that the properties of the attribute are faithfully represented as numerical properties. In this book we investigate various systems of formal properties of attributes that lead to measurement in this sense" [Krantz et al. 1971, p. 1; my emphasis added]. But is this the sole purpose of the construction of scientific theories? However important it may be to solve the problem of representation, the subject matter of scientific theories is not limited to numerical characteri- zation of some measuremental scale. To put it concisely, scientific theories are about causal connections; or, if serious objections are raised about the metaphysical ring of "causality," we can easily avoid all such references to causal connections by speaking instead of non-logical connections (or pat- terns of connectedness) that are open to empirical inspection (corrobora- tion or refutation). That is to say, science is concerned with evaluating truth-claims about the contingency of occurrence of various types of con- ditions or events. Scientific hypotheses, for the most part, take the form: 'If condition or event of type A with measureable property a occurs (in some spatio-temporal location), and if (a;b) belongs to a specified func- tion f, then condition or event of type B with measureable property b occurs (in some spatio-temporal location).' The exploration of systems of causal connections relating distinct events or conditions seems not to have been a part of the agenda for theorists of measurement, even in chapters devoted to the measurement of probability involving an "algebra of events" (see [Pfanzagl 1968, chap. 12; Krantz</page><page sequence="21">Theory and Translation 1059 et al. 1971, chap. 5]. But even if it is possible to extend the methods and results of the theory of measurement in this direction, inevitably the task of handling propositional attitudes must be undertaken, at least, for the theories of social science. This task does not amount simply to that of de- vising appropriate measuremental scales for dispositions and attitudes; it also requires that we devise appropriate logical grammars and notations capable of framing hypotheses about human behavior of the kind ex- amined earlier in this paper. Conclusions It is time to stand back and draw some general conclusions. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, observers could agree that mathe- matical economics was "riding" and even "flying" high (see [Stigler 1949, p. 37; Samuelson 1952, p. 56]). Today it is flying even higher. But every school of thought, every intellectual movement, brings with it excesses of some sort or other, and today's mathematical economics is no exception. Three such excesses are worth noting. Since the introduction of explicitly mathematical methods of analysis during the nineteenth century, theoretical work in economics has grown increasingly mathomorphic. Mathomorphism is something like reverse anthropomorphism. Whereas the latter consists of attributing human qualities to non-human entities, the former is the attempt to reduce the study, logic, explanation or description of human behavior to the logic of numbers and numerical relations. This tendency is, of course, by no means confined to economics and it reflects a basically "Newtonian" view of the universe in which the explanation of all phenomena is to be reduced to universal laws of a numerical character, a view that appeals to the theo- retical virtues of simplicity and generality reinforced by the belief that measurement is the highest form of observation. However appropriate this view may be to sciences such as physics and astronomy, it has led to the robotization of human rationality in economics. (Incidentally, since mathematics is no longer identified with the logic of numbers, 'numero- morphism' or 'arithmomorphism' might be more accurate than 'matho- morphism' etymologically, but the former is stylistically atrocious and the latter has already been claimed by another writer in a very different sense [Georgescu-Roegen 1966, pp. 21-2]. The evolution of economic theory can be likened to the evolution of the fiddler crab: one pincer (the numerical-mathematical one) having be- come grossly overdeveloped relative to the other (the logico-semantic</page><page sequence="22">1060 Ken Dennis one). And, just in the case of the fiddler crab, there are probably good evolutionary reasons why economic theorists during the nineteenth cen- tury decided to develop mathematical techniques. Anyone familiar with the "verbal" logic of late-classical writers will readily appreciate W. Stan- ley Jevons's exasperation with "the maze of Ricardian economics," and no doubt mathematical techniques have enhanced our understanding of many economics and economic relations [Dennis 1977, chaps. 5-6]. By the same token, much genuine ignorance has been disguised in technically fanciful and impressive dress, epitomized by such unedifying theories and concepts as perfect competition, perfect knowledge, and perfect mobility. The trump card of mathematical economics has always been its claim to logical rigor, the price of which has usually been empirical relevance, but what this paper has attempted to demonstrate is that this claim to logical rigor is of a very imbalanced kind, based on a double standard of high mathematical rigor and low semantic comedy. For the sake of mathemati- cal rigor, the magical sounds of such meaningless phrases as "frictionless adjustment" and "instantaneous process" were tolerated as part of the loose verbal reasoning that inevitably accompanied the mathematical py- rotechnics. In more recent years, theorists have grown more adventure- some in their choice of verbal assumptions (such as in models of uncer- tainty), but the same double standard prevails. But the most deplorable side-effect of the rise of mathematical eco- nomics (not a necessary concomitant but a side-effect nevertheless) is the rampant rationalism now so evident in the field of microeconomics. For example, while workers in the field of industrial organization are trying to assemble data to test hypotheses concerning industrial structure, behavior, and performance, theorists are trying to accomplish the same objective by means of armchair reasoning, that is, by constructing models that purport to establish logical connections between certain ideal types of market structures and behavioral patterns. In many cases, these associations are clearly of a causal nature; in other cases, the suspicion of causal proof is warranted (see [Dennis 1981]). Mathematical economics is here to stay, that much is for certain, and there is no point advocating its removal. The question is: What kind of mathematical economics should we have? What I have argued in this paper is not that mathematical economics is impossible, but that its present claims to logical rigor are dubious, and that the construction of rigorous theories of human behavior is far more difficult than has hitherto been acknowledged.</page><page sequence="23">Theory and Translation 1061 References Arrow, Kenneth J., and F.
