<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Srlvatsa Symbol in Indian Art by A. L. Srivastava In Indian art Srlvatsa has been represented either as an auspicious symbol (m?ngalika cihnd) or as a distinctive mark of a Great Person (mah?-purusa-laksana). At its initial stage, it was used as an auspicious symbol which, later on, developed into a distinctive mark of a Great Person. Its universality as an auspicious motif is quite evident from its wide popularity and application in the different forms of Indian art. Its varied re? presentations are found in the sculptures of S?ncI, S?rn?th, Bh?rhut, Udayagiri (Oriss?), Amar?vati and Mathur?. Even, it has been widely demonstrated on ancient Indian coins and terracotta seals. As a distinctive sign of Great Person, it has been represented on the chest of Jain Tirthankaras and god Visnu. This traditional and universal application of this symbol in Indian art is age old; and its antiquity in India goes back to more than 3000 years from to-day. The long tradition of Srlvatsa is well attested to by ancient Indian literature. The Brahmin, Jain and Buddhist texts ? all invariably accept the religious significance of this symbol. As an emblem or distinctive sign of a Great Person it has also an uninter? rupted and consecutive literary lore that is rich and abounding. Ancient literature is, therefore, of great help in unravelling the motive behind the use of this ancient symbol. Srlvatsa ? an Auspicious Symbol All the Indian texts .? Hindu, Jain and Buddhist ? unequivocally make mention of the auspicious symbols without any bias or restraint. Different Jain texts have enlisted so many Tirthankaras and their identification marks and symbols, trees and caityas, Yaksas and Yaksinis (*). These mention the tenth Tirthankara, Sitalan?tha having his distinctive sign as Srlvatsa. A Jain Up?nga Aupap?tika S?tra (31) recounts the eight auspicious symbols (astam?ngalika-cihna). Here Srlvatsa has also been mentioned along with svastika, nandy?varta, vardham?naka, bhadr?sana, kalasa, darpana and mina-yugma (2). Another Jain text Tiloyapannatti {Triloka-prajnapati) ? chap. 3, narrating Tales 22 to 62 ? gives a vivid description of grand buildings among which Jain temples (jin?layas) also find mention. In these Jain temples there were, apart from Jain images, eight (*) The author is obliged to his friend Shri K.S. Shukla for the English rendering of the article from the Hindi MS.

In Buddhist texts also srivatsa has been referred to among all other auspicious sym? bols like svastika, nandy?varta, cakra, padma and triratna. In the Lalita-Vistara prince Siddh?rtha's hair has been styled as "Srivatsa" (4). The same source narrates the story of Suj?t?, a country-girl, cooking p?yasa (a milk-rice dish) wherein many auspicious symbols including srivatsa formed alternately in the boiling milk (5). As regards the Brahmanical literature, srivatsa as an auspicious motif has been described only in the post-Gupta period while its reference as a distinctive mark of a Great Person is found as early as the R?m?yana. The Brhatsamhit?, while narrating the laksanas or auspicious signs of an elephant, states that the symbol that appears in the veinings of an elephant's tusk has its relative effect on the State and King who domesti? cates it. In this context effective symbols as mentioned therein are vardham?na chatra, dhvaja, c?mara, praharana, nandy?varta, lost ha and srivatsa (6). These auspicious symbols were, in the beginning, eight in number. But, later on, their number increased to nine, ten, eleven, thirteen and sixteen. One thing is also note? worthy in this connection, that these auspicious symbols were not necessarily conven? tionalized. Any eight among so many symbols as srivatsa, svastika, puspa, darpana, parasu, ankusa, bhadr?sana, m?l?, kalasa, kamandalu, pustaka and mina-mithuna, were taken for granted as asta mangalaka, i.e. eight auspicious signs. Srivatsa ? a Decorative Motif These eight auspicious symbols including srivatsa, have found a prominent position in In? dian art from 6th century B.C. to 3rd century A.D. There have been discovered several stone rings carved with female figures from ancient sites like Taxila (fig. 3.4), Kaus?mbi, Ma thur?, Ahicchatr?, Bhit?, R?jgh?t and P?taliputra. Dr V. S. Agrawala regards them as "Sri-cakras" and the female figures on them as the "Mother Goddess" (7). Such a Srt cakra, that was discovered at R?jgh?t (V?r?nasI) and is at present exhibited in the Lucknow Museum, has five mucakundas (a sort of floral motif) and five srivatsa symbols, carved alternately on the ring-wall (8). According to Dr Agrawala these stone rings belong to c. 800-300 B.C. (*). Thus, this representation of srivatsa is certainly pre-Sunga. Va? ried forms of srivatsa are found in the sculptures of S?nci, S?rn?th, Bh?rhut, Udayagiri (3) Jain, op. cit., p. 293. (4) Lalitavistara, VII (ed. P.L.

In S?nci sculpture srlvatsa has been used both as a decorative motif and an auspicious symbol. On the railing pillars of St?pa 2 at S?nci, srlvatsa has been generally used as decorative motif. In a medallion, there is a lotus cakra in the centre surrounded by four srlvatsa and four \otas-cakra symbols, placed alter? nately (fig. 1.1). In some other medallions a solitary srlvatsa occupies the crowning place (fig. 1.2, 3). Two srlvatsa symbols are engraved amidst lotus leaves and flowers in the lower half medallion of another railing pillar (fig. 1.5). There is the same motif on the upper half medallion of the other pillar of the same st?pa (fig. 1.4) (10). A similar decorative medallion and a half medallion from Bh?rhut, now in the In? dian museum, Calcutta, also show srlvatsa symbols. The medallion on a lower s?cl com? bines in its design four nandipadas and four srlvatsa symbols placed alternately and each flanked by utpala flowers numbering eight (fig. 6.1; Indian Museum, Sculpture Gallery, Panel no. 139). Another design of an upper half medallion contains a srlvatsa symbol in the middle (fig. 6.3; ibid., Panel no. 207). A beautiful representation of srlvatsa as a decorative motif has been made on the northern gate of S?nci St?pa 1. Here the arrangement of horse-riders flanking the upright bars between the architraves is actually meant for carrying their load but apparently it is purely decorative. There is a strap decorated with lotus pattern running under the neck and tail and tightly wrapped round in order to keep the saddle in place on the back of the horse on the extreme right. On this strap and just below the neck of the horse, there is a plaque of srlvatsa design (fig. 1.8) ("). Maybe the strap was fastened with a hook there. Srlvatsa ? a Sacred Motif In S?nci sculpture, the srlvatsa symbol also carries some religious import along with its ornamentation. To justify this statement there are several examples in which srlvatsa has been used in connection with dharma-cakra, triratna and st?pa symbols. The reli? gious idiom is well explained and there remains no shadow of doubt when chatra, railing and garlands accompany it. On the upper architraves of all the gates of the Great St?pa at S?nci there was originally a dharma-cakra in the centre flanked by two big triratna symbols but now these are only on the eastern and northern gateways; else? where they no longer exist. These huge triratnas which rest on a padma-cakra placed on a three-tiered platform, bear a srlvatsa on their inner uprights (fig. 1.12). The only position of triratna and the presence of srlvatsa in its lap definitely show its religious significance as a sacred symbol of worship. (10) Pillar no. 53b, see J. Marshall, A.

At the top of this panel an engraved cakra bears a huge triratna that has on its central body a simple symbol of srivatsa. This triratna is crowned with a chatra and flanked by three garlands on either side. A garland is also seen hanging on the side leaves carved in between the triratna symbol and cakr?sana, i.e. lotus-seat (fig. 1.10) (12). In this fine representation of srivatsa there is evidently a tinge of holiness and sanctity. In the same way there is, on a railing-pillar, a harmik?-btaring st?pa within double railing and triple terrace (medhi). Below it there are eight lotus cakras one upon an? other in two rows of four, and in the middle row there are four srivatsas in the same pattern (fig. 1.11) (13). The srivatsa symbol has also been carved along with st?pa, triratna and bhadra kalasa on the S?rn?th railing pillars of Sunga period. On a pillar there are four panels from top to bottom. On the two lower panels there are placed on three-stepped ?s anas, two bhadra-kalasas with branches of flowers coming out of their mouths. In the third panel the srivatsa symbol is placed on a three-tiered seat within railing. In the fourth and uppermost panel there is a st?pa within railing crowned with harmik? and chatra (fig. 2.2) (14). In a lower panel of another pillar of the same railing there is a similar srivatsa symbol as stated above on a three-stepped seat decorated with lotus-cakra design within a railing. Above it, there is, on three-tiered ?sana a pot from which emerges an octagonal pillar. Again, on the top of the said pillar there is a three-tiered platform on which there are in ascending order a kalasa, a lotus-cakra and a triratna surrounded by a dharma-cakra and crowned by an umbrella and garlands (fig. 2.4) (15). Thus, from these representations of the srivatsa symbol in the sculptures of S?nci and S?rn?th, its re? ligious significance is unquestionably recognized. Srivatsa ? as a Bead in Astamangalaka-m?l? The antiquity of modern bead-patterns of the garlands and necklaces can be judged from their prototypes in S?nci and Bh?rhut bas-reliefs. There is a beautiful depiction of eighteen necklaces hanging on pegs in an outer panel of the northern gateway of the Great St?pa at S?nci. On the upper side there is, among so many of its kind, a pair of neck? laces consisting of eleven and thirteen beads respectively. All the beads of these necklaces conform to different symbols. These include a srivatsa apart from the sun-disc, rriina mithuna, parasu, darpana, anku'sa, padma and vaijayanti symbols (fig. 1.7, 9) (16). Ac? cording to Dr V.S. Agrawala these are astamahgalaka-m?l?s (17). These astamangalaka (12) Ibid., pi. XXXVIIa. (13) Pillar no. 44c, ibid., vol. 3, pi. LXXXIII. (14) See V.S. Agrawala, Sarnath, New Delhi, 1950, pi.

Agrawala, Harsacarita: Eka S?mskrti ka Adhyayana, Patna, 1953, p. 120. 40</page><page sequence="5">necklaces might have originated on the basis of eight auspicious symbols which find an equal status in the texts of all Indian religions. There is an example in the Bh?rhut sculpture where the necklace beads represent religious symbols. A Bh?rhut railing pillar shows a Yaksi, Cand?, wearing a six-stringed necklace which has five symbolical beads appended in the middle of its first three strings. A srlvatsa is centrally placed and flanked by an elephant-goad (ankusa) and a pipal-leai motif on either side (fig. 2.6) (18). Srlvatsa with flanking symbols of a dagger and a vajra with three-pointed ends, attached in a necklace as a pendant, is seen on the female figure of a terracotta mithuna (couple) found from Ahicchatr? belonging to the Sunga period (fig. 4.5) (19). This type of necklace is found not only on all the female figures in the mithunas from Ahicchatr? but is a regular feature on the archaic terracottas from Mathur? (20). A Jain image from Mathur? wears round its neck a single-stringed chain (ek?valt) that has a srlvatsa resembling a lotus-pendant (fig. 5.11) (21). Here srlvatsa alone is represen? ted and the change in its traditional form can be well noticed. It is like a lotus flower. Srlvatsa on Amulets Recently a German archaeologist Dr H?rtel has unearthed at Sonkh (Mathur?) a terracotta hand with all its fingers stretched out. It comes from the 27th stratum be? longing to the end of the 1st century B.C. Its palm displays three symbols, viz, srlvatsa, nandipada and svastika (fig. 4.7) (22). Although the hand is supposed by some scholars to have been used as an amulet (23), possibility of its being the broken part of a terra? cotta figure cannot necessarily be ruled out. Srlvatsa as a Decoration in Headdress It appears to be an age-old practice of wearing auspicious symbols on the person either in the form of a necklace, amulet or attached in the headdress. Examples of srlvatsa symbols used in a necklaces or amulets have already been described above. Its use in ornamentation of the head-dress of some terracotta female figures belonging to the Panc?la period has come to light from Ahicchatr?. Apart from different auspicious sym? bols interwoven in the coiffures of the two terracotta female figures, the flanking streamers (18) Agrawala, Studies in Indian Art, cit., p. III.

(23) Ibid., p. 59. 41</page><page sequence="6">are each stamped with a series of four srivatsa designs which Dr V. S. Agrawala described as n?ga-mudr? symbols (fig. 4.6) (24). Srivatsa ? an Architectural Ornamentation In Indian architecture also srivatsa finds an important and honourable place. It has been found carved in Jain caves at Udayagiri and Khandagiri (Oriss?) and Buddhist sculptures at Amar?vatT. The Rani Gumph? (cave) at Udayagiri has doors crowned with arches. These arches, which belong to the 1st century B.C., have just in the centre the triratna or srivatsa symbols on them (fig. 2.5). A very fine specimen of srivatsa surmounts the arch of the Ananta Gumph? at Khandagiri (fig. 6.2) (25). Similar carvings can be seen in architectural art at Amar?vati where the arches of the caitya-w'mAows are crowned with the srivatsa symbols (figs. 2.7; 5.7) (26). Here srivatsa assumes the same supreme position as is, later on, enjoyed by the kalasa on the sikhara or tower of the temples. In Mathur? art, srivatsa along with other eight auspicious symbols has been carved in different ways. There are many representations of this symbol on railing pillars, ?y?gapattas and on the images of Jain Tirthankaras found from the ruins of the Jain St?pa at Kank?li Til? in Mathur?. Srivatsa is seen in its very ordinary form in a medal? lion on a railing pillar where it looks like two snakes face to face with raised hood (fig. 5.12) (27). For this particular form, the numismatists seem to have called it "N?ga symboF (28). Srivatsa on ?y?gapattas The ?y?gapattas from Mathur? have many religious and auspicious signs too. In an ?y?gapatta there is a seated Tirthankara image surrounded by garlands and crowned with a chatra. It has four triratna symbols on all its sides. Its left and right sides are adorned with pillars surmounted by cakra (wheel) and hasti (elephant) respectively and its upper and lower portions have astam?ngalika signs. In the upper portion there are mina-mithuna (fish-pair), bhadr?sana, srivatsa and nandy?varta, while in the lower portion triratna, cakra, puspam?l?, holy book and hhadrakalasa are present (29). Another ?y?ga (24) V. S. Agrawala, ?Terracotta Figurines of Ahichchratr??, AI, 4, p. 114, pi. XXXIII B, figs. 25, 26. (25) D. Mitra, Udayagiri &amp; Khandagiri, New Delhi, 1960, pi. Ill A.

An interesting ?y?gapatta shows a large fish-shaped svastika which, under each of its four arms, has one auspicious symbol. These are svastika, mina-mithuna, the holy book and snvatsa (31). The interior of another ?y?gapatta is adorned with ladies in a moving pose. There are eight auspicious symbols, four in the corners and four on the sides. Here we find srivatsa placed in the middle of the right side (fig. 2.8) (32). Srivatsa on Coins Srivatsa, as an auspicious symbol, is also found on ancient Indian coins. It figures on the silver punch-marked coins which are reckoned as the earliest known Indian coi? nage and are assigned to the 6th-3rd centuries B.C. One of the several punch-marked sil? ver coins found from Candraketugarh and displayed in the Asutosh Museum, Calcutta, clearly bears the mark of srivatsa (fig. 6.4). The coins of different ganas and janapadas datink back to 400 B.C. - 300 A.D., are also stamped with symbols like the Bodhi-tree, svastika, nandipada and srivatsa, etc. The Panc?la coins (c. 1st century B.C.) have very clear srivatsa symbols on them. Almost all the Panc?la coins have a group of three symbols ? srivatsa in the centre; tree within railing and a symbol like nandipada (?) on the left and right side respectively (fig. 2.12) (33). These symbols are in one row and the name of the king is given below in the Br?hmi script. Certain scholars have identified this srivatsa symbol as a Siva-linga protected by two serpents (34). What is noteworthy here is the lower side-strokes of srivatsa which are straight and not roundish. The above mentioned group of Panc?la symbols is seen on the copper coins from Ahicchatr? belong? ing to Dhruvamitra, Bh?numitra, Agnimitra, Indramitra, Jayamitra, Visnumitra, Rudra gupta and Bhadraghosha and are displayed in the Municipal Museum, All?h?b?d. The same site, i.e. Ahicchatr? has also yielded six and five Panc?la coins of Bh?mimitra and Ph?lgunimitra respectively having group symbols with srivatsa (35). Such symbols are also seen on the coins of S?ryamitra, preserved in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (36). The coin of Ph?lgunimitra has the above three symbols and the legend Phagunimitasa below on the one side and on the other a female figure standing on a lotus with her left hand on her waist and the right hand holding a lotus. A srivatsa symbol is seen to the left of the female figure (fig. 2.11) (37). Similarly, the srivatsa is also found on some ?ndhra coins excavated from Candra (30) Smith, op. cit., pi. XL (31) Ibid., pi. IX. (32) Ibid., pi. VIII. (33) CJ. Brown, The Coins of India, Calcutta, 1922, pi. I, fig. 4; AI, 9, 1953, fig. 9 (5th and 6th figures of sections IV-V). (34) V.

The symbol is represented either alone (fig. 4.2, 3) (38), or in association with many other symbols like hill, crescent, svastika, nandipada, triina mithuna, tree, etc. (fig. 4.1, 4) (39). It is also noticed on a silver punch-marked coin along with other symbols like cakra, b?na, mina-mithuna etc. (40). The symbol also figures on some coins of the Kul?tas, the rulers of the Kul? Valley whose reign is assigned by Rapson to the 1st or 2nd century A.D. (41). A coin of Kul?ta Virayasa shows on its obverse a caitya surmounted by a nandipada and flanked by a svastika and a srivatsa (42). The shape of srivatsa is quite similar to that on the terra? cotta mithuna figures of Ahicchatr? described above (fig. 4.6). Some of the Kuninda coins, assigned to the 3rd century A.D., bear many auspicious symbols, including srivatsa. The copper and silver coins of Amoghabh?ti portray on the obverse a deer and the symbol in question finds its place among the horns of the deer (fig. 6.5a) (i3). The srivatsa symbol, represented on coins of Panc?las and ?ndhras, closely resembles the srivatsa carved in the S?nci, S?rn?th, Bh?rhut, Udayagiri, Amar?vati and Mathur? sculptures. The nation-wide popularity of the symbol is quite evident from its represen? tation on coins of the Panc?las and Kul?tas in the north and on those of the ?ndhras in the south. Srivatsa on Terracotta Seals and Medallions Srivatsa has had sublime position as a sacred symbol on terracotta seals. Many such seals and sealings have been found at Bhit?, Kaus?mbi, Jh?si (all in the All?h?b?d District) R?jgh?t (V?r?nasi) and Bas?rh (Muzaffarpur District) and are preserved in the Lucknow and All?h?b?d Museums. In some cases these seals have only the srivatsa sym? bol and below it, the legend in the Br?hmi script denoting the person who used them (fig. 3.7-10) (44). On other seals such symbols as sankha, cakra, tree, etc. have also been stamped along with srivatsa (fig. 3.5) (45). Certain seals bear legends that do not name the person that used them but give some other details. In the Mathur? Museum too, there is a srivatsa-stamped sealing bearing the legend Anantasya in Br?hmi script (46). The archaeologists who exacavated and discovered these seals could not identify the sri? vatsa symbol on them and gave different descriptions to this symbol. Sir John Marshall who excavated Bhit? described this symbol as resembling a trident on one and as an (38) AI, 4, 1947-48, Ref. nos. 25, 32-34, pp. 293-94, pi. CXXVIII 25, 33.

On the seals of Bas?rh Mr Bloch identified the device as an ornamental tris?la and Spooner termed it as shield symbol (48). On palaeographic grounds these seals are dated to Kus?na or early Gupta period (49). But the symbol that is found on these seals is quite akin to the symbol that is found on Sunga sculptures and the legends on these seals are quite similar to those found on Panc?la coins; and on this basis these seals can reasonably be dated to the early centuries of the Christian era. A terracotta medallion from Sh?h?b?d (District Hardoi, U.P.) also bears srivatsa sym? bols. On one of its sides there is a circular design embellished with two triratna and two srivatsa symbols, placed alternately (fig. 3.6) (50). On the other side, a boy is seen playing with a lion (vy?la). According to Dr Jagdish Gupta, who discovered the medal? lion, it represents the legend of Bharat playing with a lion's cub as described by K?lid?sa in his Abhijn?na-S?kuntalam; and on the same basis he dates it to the 1st century B.C. (51). However there is a marked difference between the seals described above and the medallion from Sh?h?b?d. While the seals were meant for economic purposes, the Sh?h?b?d medallion seems to have some cultural significance. Srivatsa on Parasols (Chatra) The large statues of the Bodhisattvas belonging to the early centuries A.D. have round or square parasols engraved with astamangalika symbols. Two such examples have come from Mathur? art. One circular stone umbrella over the Bodhisattva image in the S?rn?th Museum, dated to the 1st century A.D., is decorated with many designs set in dif? ferent concentric circles. The outermost circle is decorated with lotus-leaf patterns and the next circle has twelve motifs clockwise ? eight auspicious symbols including srivatsa at the top and four floral motifs of one and the same design. The other symbols are mina-mithuna, nandipada, puspa-p?tra, modaka (sweet-balls or laddu), svastika, sankha and kaiasa (fig. 4.9) (52). The other square parasol that also belongs to Mathur? was placed on the three side-walls of the Gandha-kuti forming a roof (chata = chatra) over the Buddha image. On its front-side border are carved all the above noted eight auspi? cious motifs including srivatsa (fig. 4.10) (53). Srivatsa on Pottery The specimens of eight auspicious symbols have been found on earthen pots of the Kus?na period. On the Ahicchatr? pottery the srivatsa is found stamped along with other (47) Ibid.

Bajpai, the head of the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology of Saugor University, has been excavating a new site named Tumain (ancient Tumba Vana) in the District of Gun?, M.P., that has yielded antiquities dated to 500 B.C. - 1800 A.D. This long cultural sequence has been divided into five periods. The vessels of the first period (c. 500 B.C. to 200 A.D.), made of soft stone, bear designs of lotus, srivatsa and other motifs (55). Srivatsa in an Epigraph A unique example of the use of the srivatsa symbol is found in the H?thigumph? inscription of Kh?ravela. Here, on the left side, right from the first to the fifth line svastika and srivatsa symbols are carved straightway (56). The form of the srivatsa sym? bol is similar to that found on the arched gateways of the R?nigumph? cave at Udayagiri and the caitya windows of Amar?vati, both discussed above (fig. 5.5). According to Shri C. Sivaramamurti, many inscriptions begin with the words Svasti and Sri (57); here symbols are carved in place of them. This shows that the words Svasti and Sri as used in the inscriptions are respectively in the symbolized forms of svastika and srivatsa. Their first position in the given inscription denotes their good and auspicious nature; for svastika is the four-faced source of blessedness, and srivatsa symbolizes prosperity and happiness. Srivatsa as a Mark of Great Person In Indian art srivatsa is also found as a distinctive mark of a great person (Mah? purusa-laksana). The origin of this motif as a mark of a great person seems to be based on the natural growth of a small tuft of hair on the chest of great men (58). Often a distinctive sign or mark, which is found on the chest of the Jain Tirthankaras and the images of the Hindu Gods, is stated to be srivatsa on the basis of Indian literary evidences. In all Indian texts ? Hindu, Buddhist and Jain ? certain distinctive signs of great men are recognized. Among the distinctive signs of Jain Tirthankaras are long arms (touching the knee), ecstatic expression (expressing serenity and peace on the coun? tenance), naked posture and srivatsa sign on the chest (59).

See Upadhyay, Pr?cina Bharatiya M?rti-vijn?na, cit., p. 213. 46</page><page sequence="11">There are several evidences regarding srivatsa on Visnu's chest. The R?m?yana recognizes Visnu as an incarnation of God and calls him "Sankha-Cakra-Gad?-Dharah" and "Srlvatsa-vaksah" as is evident from the exclamation made by Mandodari bewailing her husband's death (60). In the Raghuvamsa (61) and Kum?rasambhava (62) there is a very interesting description of the presence of srivatsa along with Sri LaksmI and kaustubha mani on the chest of Visnu. Again, Visnu is "Srivatsa-l?nchanah" in the Amarakosa (63), "Srivats?nkitavaksah" in the Brhatsamhit? (64) and "Srivatsa-l?nchana-hrtastham" in the Gop?la Uttarat?pni Upanisad (65). In the Hal?yudha Kosa, Visnu is said to have both the srivatsa and Kaustubhamani on his chest (66). Thus, srivatsa has had a long tradition as a distinctive sign or mark of great men. In the Buddhist texts ? the Lalitavistara, Mah?padh?na Sutta and Dharmapradipik? ? there is a long list of the distinctive signs of great men. This shows thirty-two prin? cipal (vy anfand) and eighty auxiliary (anu-vyanjana) signs (67). The Samyaka-sambuddha bh?sita-pratim?-m?na-laksana indicates sankha (conch), padma{lotus), dhvaja (banner), tri s?la (trident), vajra (thunderbolt), cakra (wheel), svastika, ankusa (goad) and m?l? (garland) as good signs of the gods (68). But according to Buddhist texts, srivatsa was a hair-style, and not a sign on the chest. In the Lalitavistara the hair of Prince Siddh?rtha is styled as srivatsa (69). That is why the Buddha images in India so often have no srivatsa sign on their chest. In this context the views of Shri C. Sivaramamurti are also worth con? sidering since he maintains that the srivatsa sign was not shown on the chest of the Bud? dha, because it was often hidden under the long sangh?ti (upper garment) worn by him; it was, therefore, on his feet (70). Although the oldest text that accepts srivatsa as a sign of great person is the R?m?yana, a Brahmanical text (in which Rama, the incarnation of Visnu, is said to be "Srlvatsa-vaksah"), yet its earliest representation is mostly found on Jain images (71). Most of the Jain images of Kus?na times found from Mathur? have been identified on the basis of this particular sign on their chest; otherwise they would have been called Buddhist for want of it (72). The Jain images of Mathur? display the sign of srivatsa in different forms. A haloed Tirthankara image of the Gupta period now housed in the State Mu? seum, Lucknow, bears a beautiful srivatsa symbol on the chest, which is archaic in D R?m?yana, VI 111-13.

There is a fine representation of the srivatsa symbol on the Jain images of Candraprabha, S?ntin?tha and ?din?tha, from Kaus?mbi, Pabhos? (both in U.P.) and Jaso (M. P.) which are dated to the 6th and 12th century A.D. respectively and displayed in the All?h?b?d Museum (fig. 5.24, 30, 33) (74). This tradition of depicting srivatsa on Jain Tirthankara images which started from the Kus?na period, could not become popular on Visnu images before the medieval period. But for the Visnu image of Udayagiri, M. P. (fig. 5.14), the sign is totally absent on the Visnu images of the Gupta period. Thus, the conclusion could be deduced that srivatsa could not gain popularity as a distinctive sign of the Visnu images of the Golden Age. The medieval images of Visnu appear to have this sign copied from the Jain images of the later period. This stereotyped symbol is seen on the chest of the standing and Garuda-riding images of Visnu from Khajur?ho dated 11th century A.D. (fig. 5.31) (75). Similarly, Vinsu images from Sult?npur (U.P.) (76) and other sites in Western In? dia (77) also bear this mark on their chest. Though in the Brahmanical texts srivatsa has been described as a distinctive mark of Visnu alone, yet it was also shown on the chest of other Hindu gods. An image of S?rya (Sun-God) from Gorakhpur (U.P.) has this symbol on it (78). The images of ?di var?ha and Nrsimha from Khajur?ho and a Siva image from Garhwa (All?h?b?d, U.P.) also bear this distinctive sign of srivatsa on them (fig. 5.33 and 32) (79). An image of Brahm? from P?rsvan?tha temple, Khajur?ho (11th century A.D.; fig. 5.26) (80) and an? other of Yogan?r?yana in the Mathur? Museum (fig. 5.27) (81) also show that symbol in the form of a four-petal flower. This testifies the fact that in the medieval period this distinctive mark was used on the images of all the incarnations of Visnu along with other Vaisnava and Saiva images. Shri C. Sivaramamurti has made a detailed study of srivatsa as a distinctive sign of great men in his article entitled ? Geographical and Chronological Factors in Indian Ico? nography ? (82). The gist of his study is that the srivatsa sign was, first of all, carved on the Kus?na images of Jain Tirthankaras in Northern India (Mathur?), but it found no place on Visnu images right from the very beginning to the Gupta period. The same thing holds good with the Visnu images from Bengal, though there might be a few ex? ceptions. In the medieval period, the Srivatsa symbol on Visnu images gained a na? tion-wide popularity except in Bengal, but it was totally absent on those of the Jain Tir? thankaras of south India and Bengal.

The srivatsa symbols found in S?ncI, S?rn?th and Bh?rhut sculp? tures show their most archaic form as they are the oldest specimens in Indian sculptu? ral art (figs. 1.12; 2.2, 4, 6). All these specimens belong to 2nd-lst century B.C. The srivatsa symbol as found at S?rn?th has at the lower end of its thin loops two horizon? tal strokes with one vertical line in the middle (fig. 2.2, 4). There is a slight difference between the srivatsa symbols carved on the tor ana-gate of the R?nlgumph? cave (fig. 5.6) and that on the H?thigumph? rock inscription (fig. 5.5), both being dated to the 1st cen? tury B.C. The side loops of the H?thigumph? srivatsa symbol are somewhat pointed instead of being roundish (fig. 5.5), while that of R?nlgumph? looks like two triratna symbols placed on one another (fig. 5.6). Srivatsa on terracotta seals has great affinity with its archaic form (fig. 3.5, 7-10). There are two types of srivatsa on Panc?la coins. The one by the side of the standing lady figure on the Ph?lgunimitra coin seems to be represented with a thin line. Its lower outline is roundish but the upper portions are just like straight lines (fig. 2.11). But the srivatsa of the Panc?la group-symbols has its upper portions incurved and the lower ones turned into a straight line (fig. 2.12). In Amar?vati art also there are its two forms ? one resembling the H?thigumph? srivatsa and the other having the ends of all its five strokes transformed into a trefoil pattern (fig. 5.7) (83). The changes that occurred in the srivatsa symbol in Mathur? art are quite evident. On ?y?gapattas its form is like two n?ga figures joined with a horizontal band below; and the upper middle stroke of the S?nci, S?rn?th and Bh?rhut specimens is inverted here (figs. 2.8-10; 5.16). In the medallion of a pillar we find its simplest form, i.e. two standing snakes, face to face, with raised hoods (fig. 5.12) (84). The other developments that appear in its shape as a distinctive mark can be seen on the Jain images of Mathur? which show the addition of a triangular base and an ar? rowhead-like pointed mid-stroke (fig. 5.21) (85). The pendant of the necklace of a Jain Tirthankara looks like a blown lotus which has three raised petals ? the side petals being incurved and the one in the middle being straight. The lower petals are so incurved that they symbolize somewhat an archaic srivatsa (fig. 5.11). The upper three petals of this kind of srivatsa are just like those of the central symbol on the Panc?la coins. The form of srivatsa, found on a Mathur? medallion representing two snakes with raised hoods, is also met with on the Visnu image at Udayagiri (M.P.). The only dif? ference between the two is that the Udayagiri symbol bears a straight axis between the (83) Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures..., cit., pi. IV, figs. 35, 38. (84) Smith, op. cit., pi. LXIX 2. (85) Ibid., pi. XC 1, XCI 2, XCII, XCIII. 49</page><page sequence="14">two snakes (fig. 5.14) (86). A similar specimen is found on Kus?na pottery (figs. 3.2; 5.13) and on the Panc?la terracotta female figures as an ornamentation in headdress (fig. 4.6) both found from Ahicchatr?. The variety on the Kul?ta coins, discussed above, is also the same. The new changes and developments that occurred in the form of srivatsa as a distinc? tive sign of great men absolutely transformed its initial design. The form in which it appears on some of the Jain images of Mathur? is akin to that on the Jain ?y?gapattas which is much nearer to Sunga art (87). But on certain other images it is quadrangular in shape and looks like a lozenge (fig. 5.30, 33) (88). A similar srivatsa is seen on the Visnu images from Sult?npur and the ?divar?ha image from Khajur?ho mentioned above. On the Sult?npur image there is some indication of a line joining the two upper and lower ends and a resemblance of side petals. This design of srivatsa resembles a four-petalled flower. The medieval images of Visnu and Jain Tirthankaras testify this fact. The dated Tirthankara images (of V.S. 1038 and 1134) from Mathur? bear a clear mark of srivatsa in the form of a four-petalled flower (fig. 5.26 and 25) (89). This mark can also be seen on the chest of contempo? rary Visnu images. All the images of Visnu and Jain Tirthankaras in the All?h?b?d Mu? seum have this mark on them (90). Even this form of srivatsa has many variations in the medieval period. Sometimes the sculptors made four petals around a small circle (fig. 5.24, 28, 30) (91) and at times drew four other petals within their larger counterparts (fig. 5.25, 26, 29) (92). But or? dinarily these look like four-petalled flowers. Generally these petals are pointed, but rarely roundish (fig. 5.28) (93). Often all its four petals are equal in size (fig. 5.23-25) (94), but usually the upper and lower leaves are taller than the side ones and form the shape of a lozenge (fig. 5.26, 30) (95). On some images it is made of four small triangles instead of the flower petals (fig. 5.31, 32) (96). On the chest of certain medieval images of south India the symbol of srivatsa has been represented like a triangle (fig. 5.35) and on some others in its archaic form (fig. 5.25) (9T). The Origin of the Srivatsa Symbol in Indian Art In the light of the historical background of Indian art the opinion of some scholars cannot be accepted that the srivatsa might have been originally in the form of a four (86) AI, 6, 1950, pi.

Its earliest form shows that it was like an anthropomorphic figure. In other words, initiative for its symbolism seems to have come from the human figure itself. A close examination of Sunga srivatsa shows a human figure seated cross-legged touching its shoulders with its finger tips. The two upper and lower round projections on its physical form symbolize its two arms and legs, while the middle projection on top suggests its face. This is confirmed in S?nci and S?rn?th sculptures. In the upper half medallion of a railing pillar of S?nci St?pa 2 there is a female figure holding a bunch of lotuses in a sportive pose. But its physical outlines suggest it to be the prototype of the srivatsa symbol (fig. 1.6) ("). In the medallion on a S?rn?th railing pillar a human figure like srivatsa is carved. This figure, which is seated cross-legged, seems to be in a state of contemplation {dhy?namudra). Both the flying ends of its upper garment (uttariya) are fish-like in form (fig. 2.3) (10?). These sculptural art motifs of S?nci and S?rn?th belong to the 2nd-1st centuries B.C., and the srivatsa symbols also appear in this period. There? fore, this hypothesis cannot be totally rejected that the origin of the srivatsa symbol is primarily based on human form. Certain solid grounds to justify this fact are found in south Indian art where the middle point of the Sunga srivatsa symbol is replaced by a human head. On a square slab from Peddamudiyam the figures of Ganesa, four-faced Brahm?, Nrsimha, Visnu, Laksmi, Siva-lifiga, Mahis?suramardini and srivatsa are nicely carved. Though the srivatsa figure on this particular slab is rudimentary, the upper middle projection shows a human head crowned with head-gear (fig. 3.1) (101). In the Madras Government Museum there is a sculptural piece from K?veripakkam, which depicts a human figure seated cross-legged on a lotus, touching its shoulders with arms turned round upwards quite resembling srivatsa and flanked by two elephants (fig. 2.1) (102). These elephants are meant for bathing the figure in the same way as the ones carved in the panels of Gaja-Laksml. However, in this sculpture the elephant on the left has its trunk dangling down and the other on the right has it lifted over the head of the seated figure. The Museum plate reads "Sri-Laksmf', but Dr Jagdish Gupta, a re? nowned literateur, artist and indologist, is of the opinion that it represents srivatsa and not SrI-LaksmI (103). Another Madras Museum exhibit is a tiny copper image from Enadi (District Tan jore) which is deemed to be quite an unusual type and a unique piece among the bron? zes of the Museum. It shows a human figure with arms and legs incurved and a high beautiful crown on the head. Each of the spherical arms of this figure shows an ele? phant's head with raised trunk (fig. 3.3) (104). Thus, we may draw this conclusion that (98) Bapat, op. cit., p. 42. (") Pillar no. 75a: Marshall et alii, op. cit., vol. 3, pi. LXXXVIII. (10?) Agravala, S?rn?th, pi. IV (3rd pillar).

I, fig. 4. 51</page><page sequence="16">two parallel traditions of snvatsa, one symbolic and another anthropomorphic, flourished at the same time. The Antiquity of the Snvatsa Symbol The earliest representation of the srivatsa symbol is found so far in the Sunga art of S?nci, S?rn?th and Bh?rhut. But among the auspicious symbols recognized and accepted in Indian art, are svastika, cakra, triraina, vedik?, mina-mithuna and bhadra-kalasa besides srivatsa, and most of them have been found represented on Harappan seals and cera? mics (105) as well as in prehistoric paintings of India (106). On this basis, there will be no exaggeration if we accept that the antiquity of the srivatsa symbol also goes to prehis? toric periods. Shri C. Sivaramamurti finds this symbol on pre-Mauryan terracottas and Indus seals (107). Thus, it is definitely one of the most ancient symbols of India. Among the intriguing yet interesting relics of the Hittites from Boghazk?y in Cen? tral Anatolia, are some hieroglyphic inscriptions of 14th century B.C., which constitute the royal archives of the Hittites. Some of these hieroglyphs are in the form of a srivatsa symbol along with many others like svastika, ahkusa, parasu and cakra (fig. 4.8) (108). This might be a proof of the high antiquity of the srivatsa symbol. The Gangetic valley has produced many copper hoards which consist of copper objects like rings, celts, swords and anthropomorphic figures. The anthropomorphic fi? gures are twelve to nineteen inches long and eleven to fifteen inches wide (109). Three such implements found from Sheor?jpur (district K?npur) and one from Bisauli (District Ba daun) are displayed in the museums of Lucknow and All?h?b?d respectively. The scho? lars suppose that these were used as weapons, though they have also expressed the possi? bility of their being objects of worship as they have called them "anthropomorphic" (110) and '"human-cult-figures" (1X1). If that were the case, these implements virtually symbolized some divine power, which might have been worshipped by the people. Curiously enough these anthropomorphic figures resemble the srivatsa symbol. The only difference between these anthropomorphic figures and Sunga srivatsa symbols lies in their legs being straight instead of being round and their head being semi-circular in? stead of being pointed as in the case of the latter (fig. 4.1). Dr H. D. Sankalia aptly calls (105) N.K.

So the religious significance attached to these im? plements by scholars seems in conformity with the possibility of its being the prototype of the srivatsa symbol. According to Sir Mortimer Wheeler, these copper implements of the Gangetic Valley belong to 800 B.C., or earlier (113). Shri B.B. Lal suggests a probable date between 1500 and 1100 B.C. (114). On the basis of C-14 dating Dr H. D. Sankalia dates these copper implements to 1500 B.C. (115). Thus, these particular implements can be regarded as one of the earliest examples of srivatsa symbol in Indian Art. Conclusion From the above description it is clear that the srivatsa symbol originated in India about 3rd millennium B.C. and was stamped on Indus seals. Later it reached as far as distant Anatolia due to cultural contacts with other peoples. As regards the entry of srivatsa into the Gangetic Valley in the form of anthropomorphic figures, it is well in tune with the religious and philosophical concepts of the people inhabiting that region. Its popularity in the Gangetic basin and other parts of the country is evident from its varied and uninterrupted art of Indian sculpture, architecture, ?y?gapattas, coins, seals, pottery, terracottas and inscriptions. It is, however, to be noticed that the representation of the srivatsa symbol during the early period on these objects was made as a religious or auspicious symbol; while, as a distinctive mark of a great person it was carved only on the Mathur? Jain Images of the Kus?na period for the first time. Thus, we can con? clude that the srivatsa originating in the form of an auspicious [m?ngalika-cihna) symbol found its culmination in a distinctive sign of a great man {Mah?-purusa-laksana). Although the srivatsa symbol has been referred to as a distinctive sign of great men in ancient literature dated to c. 500 B.C., yet it was introduced as such in Indian art only in the 1st century A.D. when it was carved on the chest of the Jain Tirthankara images at Mathur?. It was referred to as the mark of Visnu, who is called "Srivatsa vaksah" in the R?m?yana, but it could have been popular on the chest of Vaisnava ima? ges only in the 10th century A.D. Stray examples are not wanting as in the case of the Visnu image of Udayagiri cave (M.P.) that bears it and belongs to the early Gupta period (?). In short, the antiquity of the srivatsa symbol goes back to the very remote past. Since then it has been used as an auspicious or religious symbol in Indian art, but in the Gupta period its popularity both as an auspicious mark and as a distinctive sign of great men somewhat waned; for even the Visnu-dharmottara Vur?na (116), while narrating the (112) History and Culture of the Indian People, I.

In the post-Gupta period, however, it regained its earlier proud position and became very po? pular throughout the country as a distinctive sign of a Great Person, but its use as an auspicious symbol fell into oblivion.
