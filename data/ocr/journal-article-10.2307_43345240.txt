<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FUNCTIONS OF MAGIC IN MILTON'S CO M US Ever since Dr. Johnson's penetrating comments it has been a commonplace to call Milton's Comus a deficient attempt at drama.1 It is, indeed, easy to find in it an apparent lack of 1 Lives of the English Poets (Oxford, 1905), I, 168 - 9. Dis- senting opinions have also been voiced, notably by Professor Tillyard in his book Milton (London, 1949, p. 65): »Comus is an experiment, not altogether unsuccessful, in drama.»</page><page sequence="2">Functions of Magic in » Comus » 311 unity. While primarily a masque written to be acted, it contains lyrical passages of intense beauty; Milton did not shun the mixing of styles as different as the idyllic pastoral at one ex- treme, and the dramatic stichomythia at the other. The argu- ment is also extremely complex, and shows what to us seems a typically Renaissance synthesis of many different elements and traditions. Of all these elements, magic is one of the most promi- nent, and an examination of its implications may therefore cast some light on the structure of Comus and on the laws of the universe Milton was describing in his masque.1 The occasion for which Comus was written 2 may well have suggested the use of magic: Wales had long been regarded as a haunt of magicians. And then, magic was a convenient dramatic device. We may, in fact, ask whether Milton could, in the Spenserian manner, have dramatized the victory of virtue purely in terms of physical strength without lapsing into crude romance. Apart from the lack of decorum that might have resulted from Lady Alice Egerton's wrestling with Henry Lawes in the midst of a banquet, and apart from the fact that Comus, a lusty man in his prime, would have been expected easily to subdue a frail young maiden, a physical fight would also have opposed Milton's aim of demonstrating the superiority of mind over body. How, then, could an abstract conflict between two wills be presented in terms sufficiently concrete for a brief court 1 A basic bibliography on Comus is available in James Holly Hanford's Milton Handbook (London, 1947). To this should be added Chapter IV, »Comus», of Davis P. Harding's Milton and the Renaissance Ovid (Urbana, 111., 1946); the debate between C. S. Lewis and B. A. Wright in The Times Literary Supplement , 1945, pp. 331, 367, 463, and 511; »The Action of Comus» in Pro- fessor Tillyard's Studies in Milton (London, 1951); J. C.

If Milton had called forth major gods and devils to intervene and solve the struggle, an ultimate appeal to the highest divine authorities would have become unavoidable in a work so consistently preoccupied with the great chain of being. And this would have led to a treatment of problems of cosmic magnitude like those of Paradise Lost . But the use of magic provided an ideal solution. It did not endanger dramatic con- ventions; in literature magic had often been associated with the academic disputation, the débat ; and, since the works of a magician can be suddenly undone by more powerful magic, it provided the author with an admirable means of achieving a dramatic dénouement . Magic, however, was much more than a playwright's ex- pedient: at the same time Milton used it to demonstrate the order of the universe of Comus. Tradition, both theological and secular, had given those practising magic, black or white, very definite places in the chain of being. So in Comus the relative powers of the participants are gradually made clear by refer- ences to the potency of their charms. Only thus can we easily establish their rank in the hierarchy. The white magic of the chaste Lady's will alone is sufficient to avert disaster, but not powerful enough to keep Comus, born of mighty Circe and Bacchus, from immobilizing her in his enchanted chair. The Attendant Spirit, with the aid of magic haemony, is stronger than Comus, but not sufficiently so to release the Lady and undo the spell. For this, a more powerful white magician, Sabrina, has to be invoked; ultimately the Lady's virtue acts as a trigger- force releasing Sabrina's full powers.1 But no might in the uni- 1 It might be argued that Sabrina, except for her contribution to the »local colour», is a superfluous character: why should her virtue be superior to that of the Lady? The answer is obvious. In addition to Sabrina's contribution to the dramatic effect of Comus , her career had given her the right to practise white magic. To make this clear, Milton with great care changed Geoffrey of Monmouth's original story. (See R. Blenner-Hassett, »Geoffrey of Monmouth and Milton's 'Comus': A Problem in Composition,»</page><page sequence="4">Functions of Magic in %Comus* 313 verse of Comus is strong enough to transmute Comus* crew back into human shape; all of his victims had once fallen for tempta- tion and hence been exposed to the full might of his sorcery. The escape of Comus indicates the everlastingness of his nefarious schemes, and releases the author from the obligation of embar- king upon problems outside the immediate world of his masque. Many passages in Comus make it impossible to forget that the poet had a didactic purpose; he repeatedly brings in »the sage and serious doctrine of virginity». But the plot itself rigorously observes the conventions of natural magic. Thus the sorcery of the high-born Comus, like that of any mortal magic- ian, depends on definite manual rites that are bound to ex- píicit conditions.1 His wand can be used by others to reverse Studia Neophilologica , XXI, 216 - 21 [1949J; C. Grant Loomis, White Magic . An Introduction to the Folklore of Christian Legend [Cambridge, Mass., 1948]. Cf. The Faerie Queene9 Book II Canto X xiii-xix.) Sabrina was more than a mere » Dea ex machina »: although her pedigree was noble, that of Comus was nobler still, and therefore she could not be expected to compete with him successfully without the aid of superior magic. Her aid could also have been obtained by any virgin »in hard besetting need,» as the Attendant Spirit tells us in Comus , 11. 852 ff. Sabrina's position might perhaps be characterized as that of a tactical reserve. 1 Darkness and a »thick wood» were necessary prerequisites. A »holier ground» (1. 943) would have made Comus powerless. The rite included offers of a magic potion from a crystal goblet, which inspired Milton to the sensuous lines we are tempted to characterize as Keatsian: And first behold this cordial julep here That flames, and dances in his crystal bounds With spirits of balm, and fragrant Syrops mixt. (672 - 4.) The breaking of Comus' cup is explicitly mentioned in 1. 651. (Cf. The Faerie Queene9 Book II Canto XII lvii, and The Old Wives' Tale.) »Magick dust» (1. 165) and the use of a wand (1. 659) were included among Comus' rites. The only reference to oral, as opposed to manual, rites occur in 11. 153 - 4 (spells) and 817 (»backward mutters of dissevering power»).</page><page sequence="5">314 Nils Erik Enkvist his spells.1 Similarly, the Attendant Spirit relies upon his haemony,2 while even Sabrina has to sprinkle and anoint the Lady to free her.3 Music, another immaterial force which had been associated with virtue ever since the Greeks, temporarily restrains Comus from his evil intentions.4 It is also used to invoke Sabrina, who responds with another song. The reference to Hecate must also have been significant to Milton's audience.5 Numerous scattered references to magic emphasize its import- ance. All this is, of course, consistent with the Platonic principle that, when dealing with human beings, even gods cannot trans- gress the laws of finite existence: divine concepts can only be grasped by a human mind in human terms, concepts or images. (Consequently, by reversing the process we may interpret Comus in higher, symbolic, terms.) Hence the great Platonic importance of knowledge and mental purity, »the unpolluted temple of the mind.»6 (This leads us back to the significance of virtue.) Hence also the horror of the transmutation into an animal, a process that implies both the loss of individuality and soul. Thus Milton's use of magic forms one link in the chain 1 LI. 653, 816 ff.

In the competition between white and black magic that runs through Comus symbolizing an abstract conflict, both parties are equally dependent on the techniques of sorcery.1 But beyond making the action of the masque consistent within its own framework, magic still has another, albeit less obvious, function. While stressing Milton's synthesis of the »order of nature» and the »order of grace» in Comus , which is said to be characteristic of the true Christian humanist of the Renais- sance, Professor Woodhouse has pointed out that it contains a gradual ascent from natural beauty through classical mytho- logy and idyllicism to an exposition of Christian ethics, i. e., a transition from nature to grace.2 Now the full significance of Milton's use of magic does not become clear unless we remember that, traditionally, there were two different types of magic corresponding to these two orders. In the order of nature, 1 The repeated emphasis of » hidden strength» in 11. 415 ff., and particularly the phrasing of 11. 417 - 20: 2. Bro. What hidden strength, Unless the strength of Heav'n, if you mean that? Eld . Bro . I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength Which if Heav'n gave it, may be term'd her own ... may be interpreted as a repudiation of direct interference of gods on behalf of the Lady. In 1. 597 Milton pronounces evil »self- consum'd», and in 11. 611 - 5 the case is stated beyond ambiguity: But here thy sword can do thee little stead, Farr other arms, and other weapons must Be those that quell the might of hellish charms, He with his bare wand can unthred thy joynts, And crumble all thy sinews. Magic, then, must be met with magic: similia similibus curantur. 2 »The Argument of Comus», University of Toronto Quarterly , XI, 46 - 71 (1941).

Just as anybody with a knowledge of the elements of chemistry may precipitate a white cloud of silver chloride by adding a few drops of hydro- chloric acid to a solution of silver nitrate, so those possessing the secrets of magia naturalis thought themselves capable of achieving their aims directly, without the aid of supernatural beings. But magic could also be an act of religious significance, where the assistance of angels or gods (white magic) or devils (black magic) was invoked by the magician; the availability of such assistance made clear his religious, moral, and ethical standing. The ambiguity of magic thus makes it possible for us to interpret the same actions on two different levels, nature and grace.2 Hence Milton's use of magic in Comus helps to forward the listener or the reader from the order of nature to the order of grace without apparent didactical and explanatory machinery. Obviously magic plays a more important part in Comus than in any other of Milton's poetical works. In the Nativity Ode and Hymn some allusions were made to traditional accounts of the Christian legends, but in the major works the very nature of Milton's themes and his preoccupation with deities, who, how- ever anthropomorphic, needed no tricks when pursuing their aims, precluded the extensive use of both natural and religious magic. In Paradise Lost Satan and his crew flourish no wands; they have learned to invent devilish engines.3 It is significant 1 I have deliberately avoided the use of the term »pseudo- scientific», which implies an evaluation in terms of' later empirical concepts. To the practitioner of natural magic his rites were not »pseudo-science», they were the scientific methods of his age. 2 For a brief, but not entirely irrelevant discussion of magic and realism in The Tempest , see Bonamy Dobrée, »The Tempest,» Essays and Studies 1952 , pp. 18 - 9. s The parallels between Paradise Lost and the Xllth Canto of Book II of The Faerie Queene are mainly structural; the parallel between Acrasia and Eve does, of course, not include Acrasia's »sorceree and witchcraft.»</page><page sequence="8">Functions of Magic in *Comus* 317 that magic is prominent in Cornus , Milton's youthful, exuberant, and most typically Renaissance work; his subsequent disregard of the Elizabethan ideals and his increasing, interest in concise rational systems can even be predicted from the changes made in the 1637 edition.1 And the great skill with which the magic of Comus is integrated with the many other elements and rivets them seamlessly together suggests that to Milton, at the time of the composition and revision, magic was an intellectual rather than emotional issue. In a wider framework this may be said to reflect the changing intellectual character of the period, and to herald the advent of the more rational empiricism which received its most important literary expressions in styles of grow- ing classical restraint. The great vogue of witchcraft was passing.2 It would lead us too far afield to examine the magic of Comus in the light of parallel passages in other literary works. We can, however, note in passing some of the significant differ- ences between the magic of Comus and that of the Bower of Bliss episode in The Faerie Queene . In Spenser, virtue itself possessed magic powers: Sir Guyon and his »attendant spirit» the Palmer succeeded in defeating Acrasia without resorting to magical rites and apparatus.3 Only when commuting Acrasia's beasts back into men did the Palmer apply his »vertuous staffe», and it is implied that at least one of them would still have preferred to wallow in sensuous pleasures: Said Guyon, See the mind of beastly, man, That hath so soone forgot his excellence Of his creation, when he life began, 1 C. S. Lewis, »A Note on 'Comus'», Review of English Studies , VIII, 170-6 (April, 1932) 2 Although in England witches were not executed after 1682, witchcraft did not cease being a statutory offense until 1736. 8 Similarly in The Faerie Queene , Book III Canto XII, Brito- mart rescues Amoret without consorting to the methods of magic. She compels the magician to reverse his own charms, whereupon he is »captiue with her led to wretchednesse and wo» (xli).</page><page sequence="9">318 Nils Erik Enkvist That now he chooseth, with vile difference, To be a beast, and lacke intelligence. To whom the Palmer thus, The donghill kind Delights in filth and foule incontinence . . .* In Cornus, on the other hand, even the virtuous party has to conform to the methods of magic, while those who have de- liberately chosen to join Comus' crew are beyond succour. This suggests that the magic of Comus is better integrated with the action and argument; everybody has to obey the same immu- table rules. Milton also has a stronger implicit emphasis on the Platonic doctrine of purity of will, which he achieves with less direct and disturbing didacticism than Spenser. The impression remains that in Spenser's episode, magic was one of the many elements the author loosely wove ito his complex story. There- fore the Bower of Bliss episode lacks unity: the sensuous rap- tures of a Garden of Love must suddenly be abandoned for a lecture on ethics. Milton used the ambiguity of magic to bring home the lesson, and did not have to embark upon a sermon in the middle of his masque. We may conclude that he handled his magic with greater skill than Spenser. To sum up. The function of magic is to make Comus consistent within its own framework, to suspend external inter- ference and to bring the action under one set of immutable rules, and to rivet together the various elements, including nature and grace, into one philosophically (though not always artisti- cally) perfect whole - in short, to give the masque unity of action and thought. Such pregnancy of meaning and also such an interweaving of many traditions into a consistent philo- sophy as we find in Comus is characteristic of the best literature of the English Renaissance, a period when »theology included all philosophy and a great deal of natural science.»2 Nils Erik Enkvist 1 Ibid., Book II Canto XII lxxxvii. 2 E.
