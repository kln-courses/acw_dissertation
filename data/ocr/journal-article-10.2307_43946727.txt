Vision, Nature, and the Metaphysical in the Landscape of Richard Lewis's "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis" The journey of a spring day, along the banks of the Patapsco River and traversing colonial Maryland from an inland village to the coastal capital of Annapolis, forms the subject of a once forgotten but recently revived poem by Richard Lewis (i700?-33?). "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis" (1731) records a depiction of the New World s landscape by a haggard language teacher, part-time colonial government functionary, Enlightenment-era amateur scientist, and "Pedagogue of Art,"1 a depiction that records the nature of the region and its inhabitants using aesthetic, pastoral, scientific, and spiritual discourses. The poem exhibits delightful attention to and appreciation of natural detail as well as surprising moments in which aspects of the environment are repressed and ignored. Lewis, himself an immigrant who faced the challenges of holding a liminal class position in the raucous social world of colonial Maryland, creates a narrator who seeks identification within the natural environment but who also wishes to read nature as a text for scientific analysis and spiritual edification. Among those forces that shape the poem are a keen attention to aesthetics and concern for the intersec- tions between beauty and bounty. Yet in order to create a work in which humans seemingly exist harmoniously with nature, the poet must willfully excise grating elements from the landscape, a gesture that haunts the nar- rator when he considers that which is beyond nature, an all-powerful deity who could as easily excise him from the universe. The poems two primary emphases- description of material nature and representation of spiritual crisis- have been the basis of scholarly divi- sion in earlier criticism of the poem. While most critics have selected one of those two aspects for examination, positioning the other as secondary {41</page><page sequence="2">42} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 (Carlson 307; Johnson 117; Beyers, "Augustan" 209-12), we see Lewis as a poet who purposefully juxtaposes earthly and heavenly themes. Lewis's epigraph, taken from Virgils Georgics , suggests a complex intertwining of the natural and the spiritual: "Give me the ways of wandering stars to know, / The depths of heaven above, and earth below."2 Lewis's quest tra- verses the material environment, while apprehending its metaphorical applications and its metaphysical implications. He brings to bear the dis- courses of science, religion, and art as he examines nature, divinity, and ultimately himself. We assert that Lewiss poem requires careful attention to both materiality and spirituality, as well as to what is seen and unseen more generally in the poem; therefore, our reading combines an ecocriti- cal emphasis on materiality with an ecothoeological recognition of meta- physicality. lewis's "journey" in the twenty-first-century ECO CRI TICAL LANDSCAPE Viewing Lewis's poem through an ecocritical lens reveals the poet's struggle to envision and articulate his own position within the nature he seeks to represent. Robert Kern identifies a range of modes by which texts depict nature. He sees some literature as anthropocentric, blind to "the possibility that nature might validly pursue its own goals and inten- tions, without need of human . . . 'improvement'" (267). At times, Lewis's poem seems blind in this way, performing the work of an imperial gaze in a sweeping appropriation of everything it sees. In contrast, the ecocentric poem, Kern asserts, must be "displaced, taken precedence over, virtually and grammatically, by what lies outside" (272). Lewis's narrator engages in self-displacement while centering attention on the more-than-human world, though identity and resource politics complicate this displacement; still, the narrator's vision often exhibits an ecosensitivity that registers the poem on the ecocentric end of Kern's scale, since the poem expresses "a sort of neighborly solicitude for [the] more-than-human inhabitants of [the] local environment" (Kern 273). Lewis and his narrator invoke a series of contrasting methodologies to situate his poem. The title employs human geopolitical signifiers (e.g., "A Journey from Patapsco in Maryland to Annapolis"), which reference two English queens,3 as well as the lexical influences of the native Algonquians,</page><page sequence="3">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 43 who provided the river Patapsco with its name. In contrast, the opening lines of the poem provide a bioregional address for the journey:4 I mount my Horse, and lonely take my Way, From woody Hills that shape Patapscos Head, (In whose deep Vales he makes his stony Bed, From whence he rushes with resistless Force, Tho' huge rough Rocks retard his rapid Course,) Down to Annapolis. (7-12) The poem s parenthetical insertion is set apart, not only by punctuation5 but also by its alternative perspective, as it parallels the narrator s jour- ney with that taken by the water of the Patapsco River from its head to the Chesapeake Bay. Similarly, while the title (in its first British publication) announces a specific date via a human calendar system ("April 4, 1730"), the poem announces the season of the journey via a feminized personifi- cation of nature and reference to seasonal signifiers, including temperature and plant growth: April views with Smiles the infant Year; The grateful Earth from frosty Chains unbound, Pours out its vernal Treasures all around, Her Face bedeckt with Grass, with Buds the Trees are crown'd. (2-5) The duality of perspective exhibited in the poem, being both anthropocen- tric in the title and ecocentric in its opening lines, illustrates the narrator s multivalent, complex, sometimes contradictory views of nature. Lewis's narrator alternates rapidly between these registers, complicating the posi- tion of Lewis's poem within Kerns continuum. The poem s date offers an additional complication of Kern, who overlays his range of positions with historical progression. Earlier authors tended toward the anthropocentric, Kern implies, with more recent authors ex- pressing an increasingly ecocentric consciousness. Instead, Lewis's "Jour- ney" exemplifies John Sitter's assertion that eighteenth-century poetry ex- hibits a more complex biocentrism and a more sophisticated apprehension of the overlay of human and nonhuman identities than that expressed by nineteenth-century poets, such as Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley. Sitter describes the Romantic poets as comparatively androcentric, demonstrat- ing "a tendency to regard the natural world as merely the setting for human</page><page sequence="4">44 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51&gt; NUMBER 1 action." Further, he counters the association that some scholars make be- tween "literary origins of modern ecological consciousness" and Roman- ticism, saying the issues that most concern twenty-first-century environ- mentalists have more in common with the poetry of the early eighteenth century (13). Lewis's narrator exemplifies another kind of ecosensitivity with his treatment of the distinction between place and space, first articulated criti- cally by Yi-Fu Tuan: "Place is security, space is freedom: we are attached to one and long for the other. . . . Space and place are basic components of the lived world Human lives are a dialectical movement between shel- ter and venture, attachment and freedom" (3-4, 54). The spaces and places of literary setting, previous to Tuan's intervention, were often marginal- ized in critical discourse as mere devices of artistry or as pathetic fallacies passively reflecting human emotions. However, the environments passed through during Lewis's "Journey," when recognized as varying between place and space, illuminate the poems themes of mortality and spiritu- ality, particularly as the narrator envisions the landscape and its animal, floral, and arboreal inhabitants as existing both for themselves and along- side himself. Our reading, which combines Tuan s critical apparatus of space and place, Sitter s assertion that eighteenth-century literature shows ecological awareness, and Kerns literary spectrum of environmental consciousness, traces the narrators anxiety over what he sees, his fears over what might be unseen, and his own act of rendering invisible some elements of the landscape. Seeing the unseen in Lewis's poem involves recognizing that the discourses of race and gender suffer erasure as a result of elevating the aesthetic, scientific, and religious discourses that center on nature.6 Lewis's narrator represses ethical considerations by means of his aesthetic expres- sions, techniques employed to manage an anxiety prompted by the study of nature, namely the apprehension of the invisibility that results from death. Sitter indicates that eighteenth-century poetry in general reflects a metaphysical worldview that accommodates divine, as well as human, agency; "eighteenth-century ecological thinking is virtually always theo- logical-that is, providential, grounded in discourses of physicotheology' and theodicy," which makes the poetry relevant to both ecocriticism and ecotheology (11), an approach that foregrounds divine-human-nonhuman interactions. Ecotheology "encompass [es] an awareness that is beyond the</page><page sequence="5">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 45 human, inclusive of the natural world in which humanity is embedded" (Deane-Drummond x) and moves beyond Hegelian binaries, such as divine/human, instead substituting a more complex trinary (Dell 66). In adding the nonhuman element to the dialectic between God and humanity, Lewis envisions a three-way communion between his narrator, God, and nature. In the first dimension of this communion, and during the daylight, the rider locates himself in the imago dei , capable of rising above nature and appreciating it in a godlike manner; in this position he is able to erase the scenes of environmental degradation, slavery, and genocide from the landscape. In the second dimension, during the darkness that follows sunset, he finds himself situated within nature and thereby vulnerable to the annihilation of invisibility he exercised against others during the day- light. The first move subjectifies the narrator, making him one with God yet forming nature as an "other"; the second move objectifies the narrator, positioning him as one with nature and transforming God into an "other" (or more accurately in Lewis's depiction, making both the narrator and na- ture an "other" under God). His appeal to "my Creator" (39) in the morn- ing and "my great Creator" (380) in the evening further solidifies a sense of simultaneous divine-human-nonhuman kinship and estrangement, which intensifies over the course of the day. As Christopher Johnson suggests, Lewis's theodicy rejects "the induc- tive approach of the deists" and ultimately avows his belief in "a Christian God who grants eternal salvation without providing consistent evidence of his benevolence" (117-18). At the same time, the poem also calls for a theo- logically informed critical apparatus through which to read its depictions of nature, such as the scenes of the lone tree struck by lightning and the prey fish carried off by a hawk; such images contrast with nature s beauty and bounty: the lovely spring morning, the sun, the "teeming plains" (41) of flowers and grain, as well as colorful birds. Within this paradoxical land- scape of fecundity and violence, Lewis's narrator finds himself grappling not only with his sense of impending mortality but with his assurance of a personal deity, confidently asserted with the dawn but thrown into doubt as the sun sets; the poems closing benediction functions as an act of sur- render to the deity despite the lack of resolution to the narrator s quanda- ries. The narrator s spiritual doubt, in other words, stems from his identi- fication both upward in the chain of being with God and downward with nature.</page><page sequence="6">46} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 DAYTIME VISION: THE POEM'S FLORA AND FAUNA IN PLACE Despite its near-scientific use of descriptive detail, "A Journey" both reveals and conceals Marylands colonial environment. While the poem contains the "first important poetic appearance" of the mockingbird for British- American readers (Lemay 142), it erases other endemic aspects of colonial Marylands landscape, such as tobacco cultivation, the growth of slavery, and the displacement of native peoples. These revisions are not accidental, or based on ignorance, but are a strategy employed to create a vision of harmonious pastoral coexistence between the narrator and the nature he describes. Lewis did not select details of his poem arbitrarily or for the sake of realism. Tobacco, for instance, the predominant cash crop in early eighteenth-century Maryland, makes no appearance, even though the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, the district identified in the poems title, bore a reputation for extensive tobacco cultivation. In contrast, Lewiss narrator depicts the landscape as if its plantation owners exercised Eastern Shore practices of grain production (Roundtree and Davidson 124). The choice to render tobacco invisible enhances the poems aesthetic register, given that the agricultural process associated with tobacco in- volved periodic clear-cutting of forests and otherwise marring the beauty of the landscape. Evidence suggests that Lewis understood the reality of tobacco production, including its labor conditions and impact on Native Americans, as well as the political instability occasioned by its cycles of booms and busts. This message emerges in Lewis's tribute poem "Car- men Seculare," praising his patron, Lord Calvert, governor of the colony of Maryland, whose aesthetic preferences seem to have shaped "A Journey." In a letter dated March 18, 1728/29, Calvert described to his correspondent the common talk of the regions inhabitants: "planting Tobacco and such other improvements of trade, as neither the Muses inspire, nor Classic Au- thors treat of" (Beyers, "Maryland's" 247). He wrote in the same letter that Lewis was "a man really of Ingenuity, and to my Judgment well versed in poetry" (Lemay 126; Yentsch 83). Herein lies at least one reason for the par- ticular (and peculiar) aesthetics of Lewis's poem. The author sought to em- brace the elevated conversation Calvert found lacking in the colony, pro- viding evidence that the Muse could inspire poets even in the frontiers of the empire. Lewis's artistic reshaping of the region's landscape results in a</page><page sequence="7">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 47 flattering portrayal of uncontested plenty sure to please his patron, despite Lewis's knowledge to the contrary. A sense of security dominates these early passages: "Thro' sylvan Scenes my Journey I pursue, / Ten thousand Beauties rising to my View" (36-37). Lewis's "Journey" begins in an environment that its narrator experiences as place, in the "woody Hills that shade Patapscos Head" (8). The narra- tor finds not only aesthetic satisfaction in the sights of nature but also a sense of surety of sustenance to be gained from the fecund fields of "grassy wheat," which have been "enclos'd" to harness them for human use, and "heal the aching Sight with cheerful Green" (49-50). Pigs make a single memorable cameo appearance in the poem, when they "snore supine" (31) while "All [others] joyful rise" at daybreak (30). The "obscene litter" of sleepy swine provides a comforting image of agri- cultural wealth, but also a model of inaction that the narrator rejects. Yet the pigs' indolence serves as evidence of the land's bounty: "Hunger breaks the Bond [of sleep] and bids them rise" (33). By rousing to feed their hun- ger, the pigs increase the farmer's wealth, and contribute to the poet's posi- tive portrayal of the colony's plentiful resources. While Ebenezer Cook's The Sot-Weed Factor ; or ; A Voyage to Maryland (London, 1708; reprinted in the Maryland Gazette between 1727 and 1731 [Yentsch 84]) testifies to the significance of swine to colonial Maryland's landscape and culinary palette, pigs also formed a contested site between wealthy planters and the oppressed laboring classes: English indentured servants in the seventeenth century, but increasingly African slaves during the eighteenth. Given the extent to which swine were stolen by both servants and slaves to augment sometimes dangerously meager diets, resulting in both physical punish- ments and legal action in colonial Maryland (Taylor 144, 155), the image of an "obscene litter" of swine in Lewis's landscape suggests a plentitude achieved only by a repression of the uneven distribution of food among the various classes of humans, and therefore represents an example of aspi- rational revisioning of the landscape by the narrator. Not limiting his idealization of the scene to a surfeit of pork, the narra- tor transfers a multispecies source of wealth (animal and grain) seen in the landscape onto the humble inhabitants of a cottage that he passes, whose class status is poetically exaggerated (and thereby obfuscated) by associa- tion with the riches of nature:</page><page sequence="8">48} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 5I, NUMBER 1 Safe in yon Cottage dwells the Monarch-Swain , His Subject-Flocks , close-grazing, hide the Plain; For him they live; - and die ťuphold his Reign. (51-53) The plural noun "Subject-Flocks" indicates a communal group that could interchangeably reference humans or animals, similar to people in some contexts during the early eighteenth century (Sitter 17). Sitter examines words such as flocks as examples of eighteenth-century consciousness about animal-human interconnection; he cites the use of people during the period to refer to both animals and humans- a usage that seems to die out in the early nineteenth century- and its correlate, the common use of the participial peopled to mean "populated," whether by people or animals. Thomas Gray, for example, uses "peopled air" to denote birds, and Henry Travers similarly uses "peopled Wave" to identify fish. Pope uses the term in its negative in his complaint that Norman kings "dispeopled Air and Floods" by mistreating their environments (Sitter 18). While Sitter doesn't mention "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapo- lis," this poem would have served his argument well. Besides the refer- ence to flocks, Lewis's narrator later notes how the animals prepare for the coming night: "The plumy People seek their secret Nests, / To Rest re- pair the ruminating Beasts" (237-38). The phrase "plumy People," rather than an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic metaphor, is legible as an ex- pression of the intersection of human and nonhuman animals' identities. As an augmentation of Sitter s observations about a biocentric tendency in eighteenth-century poetry, Lewiss use of ruminating &gt; a term not noted by Sitter, functions similarly to people as a lexical intersection between human and nonhuman identity, since the term could be used in the eighteenth century to mean both "to chew the cud" and "to contemplate." Lewis's use of both "plumy People" and "ruminating Beasts" lends additional support to Sitter's call for closer assessment of eighteenth-century nature poetry, particularly for its engagement with the question of humanity's place within the environment. As the description continues, the fields themselves yield forth their bounty for the "monarch-swain": "Viands unbought his well-till'd Lands afford, / And smiling Plenty waits upon his Board" (54-55). The diction here asserts a sense of Old World stability and security, a myth of the mother country that settlers often nurtured in the New World; "Viands</page><page sequence="9">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 49 unbought" uses an antiquated word for provisions, already three hundred years old at the time of the poems composition. Security is reinforced via a "smiling Plenty ' shared with "Sons robust," the "Companions of his Care" (58-59), suggesting the satisfaction of both present needs and future pos- terity. This brief passage contains references to all the elements of place, as a "center of felt value where biological needs, such as those for food, water, rest, and procreation, are satisfied" (Tuan 4). However, the absence of any reference to the swain s wife, with whom those " Sons robust" were sired, registers the Chesapeake colonies' "skewed sex ratio," which resulted in many white men never finding wives appropriate to forming "family households," also known as "little commonwealths," which were seen as the foundation of a monarchical political system that began with the man as the head of his family and ended with the king as head of the nation (Taylor 141). The narrator s blind eye at once marginalizes the female body within the agribusiness scene, figuratively restricting her to the domes- tic scene; even there, however, the poet only hints at her presence synec- dochically through the poetic device of personification, the "smiling Plenty [that] waits upon his Board," in place of the woman essential to prepare and serve his food, along with " Sleep , with downy Wings, oershad[ing] his Bed" (57), in place of the woman with whom he might be "sleeping." Further, the idealized " Sons robust" not only share the labor but serve as "Companions of his Care," thereby replacing the absent female body. Lewis's idealized depiction of the "Monarch- Swains" reign over a loyal household and landscape, which freely offers up its bounty as tribute, is more than a simple indulgence of pastoral fantasy. While Ebenezer Cook s depiction of ignorant, violent, and debased planters is skewed to achieve satire, Lewiss poem (which may be a deliberate response to Cook s crude- ness [Yentsch 84]) is hardly a more realistic portrait of labor conditions in early eighteenth-century Maryland. The " Monarch-Swain ' hints at the lord proprietor system that characterized the colony of Maryland under Lord Calvert, whose home in Annapolis was surrounded by a pleasure garden and orangery (Yentsch 113). The depiction obscures the significant divi- sions between the various classes and racial groups into which the inhabi- tants of Maryland were divided. The idealized "monarch- swain" invokes a rhetoric that flattens and naturalizes the power structure, obscuring the reality of living conditions in colonial Maryland for those belonging to the lowest social rungs. The death rates in the colony among indentured ser-</page><page sequence="10">50 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 vants (Taylor 143) suggest that most residents did not perceive themselves as ensconced in "smiling Plenty ." Furthermore, African slave labor had sig- nificantly displaced the system of indentured servitude by poor white En- glish men and women in Maryland in the early decades of the 1700s; Afri- cans may have represented as much as 50 percent of the population in the Chesapeake Bay population by 1730 (Wood 63). Thus a snapshot of agricul- tural labor in Maryland around the time of the poems composition would likely have included transplanted Africans. Lewis's revisionism is not isolated to race and human labor issues in the poem, but extends to the aspect of domesticated nature associated with farm labor, the horse. The simple phrase "I mount my Horse," which launches movement within the poem, could have been the prelude to a de- piction of companionship crossing hierarchical levels between the narra- tor and nature. To mount a horse is a subjective, material, physical, even sensual engagement with nature; however, the narrator immediately pairs this gesture of intimacy with an image of social isolation: "and lonely take my way" (7). Taken as a whole, the line renders the horse as vehicle rather than companion. Ironically, this first reference to the horse in the poem is also the last, despite the fact that the narrator presumably rides the horse for the entire journey. This neglect of the horse on the narrators part belies the significance of the horse to the poem s descriptive content and style. Placing the nar- rator on horseback has the advantage of providing the rider with leisure time and energy to observe and comment on the nature through which he passes. The horse s labor directly meets the narrators need for repose throughout the journey by creating a movable sphere of place around the rider as the horse traverses Marylands topography on his behalf.7 In "The Thresher s Labor" (1730), Stephen Ducks most popularly received poem, Duck describes the difficulty of producing poetry when fatigued by physi- cal labor: "Can we, like Shepherds, tell a merry Tale: / The Voice is lost, drownd by the louder Flail" (lines 52-53). The focus required by the labor- ing task, and its physical exertion, blinds the worker and numbs the poet: "Alas! What pleasing Thing / Here, to the Mind, can the dull Fancy bring?" (54-55). Ducks illustration applies well to Lewiss narrator; had he made such an extended journey on foot, rather than horseback, the energy ex- pended would have limited his ability to behold the "pleasing Object [s]" (Duck 56) along the way, thereby arousing the Muse s spleen, repressing</page><page sequence="11">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 51 the poetic "Voice," and prohibiting the narrator s spiritual contemplations. In contrast, Lewis's narrator speaks of becoming caught up in the sights and thoughts of his journey to the extent that he loses track of his progress when climbing a hill (197-201). Had the narrator mounted the summit on foot, rather than by the aid of his horse, undoubtedly the physical exertion required by the assent would have distracted him from his contemplations. Besides providing a sense of place and (relative) comfort while on the move, the invisible horse provides the narrator with a larger field of vision. Because the narrator is atop a horse, he can more readily view the flowers growing on the ground at a distance while the birds singing in the trees are brought closer. Free from the distraction of physical exertion, the narrator focuses on other aesthetically pleasing aspects of the landscape, such as the wild flowers, in what Lemay identifies as the "first extended descrip- tion of native flowers and wildlife to appear in American poetry" (140). Specifically, the "various Flourets [that] grace the teeming Plains" (41) are celebrated for their rich color variety of golds, silvers, blues, and yellows; when the narrator s aesthetic appetite has been seemingly cloyed by the "flaming Yellow" cinquefoil that "wounds the tender Eye" (47-48), he is immediately revived by "the grassy Wheat. . . / [which] heal[s] the aching Sight with cheerful Green" (49-50). While previous scholars have identi- fied these floral descriptions as evidence that the poem operates along the logic of promotional literature touting the color completeness of the New World (Kropf 26-27) or as engaging a nature metaphor for omnipotent divinity (Lemay 141), we read them as indicative of the poems particular depiction of the controlling power of perspective, complicating the idea of seeing and not seeing that preoccupies the narrator. As the narrator rides away from the seat of the plantation, he turns his attention from the flowers in the fields to the birds in the trees. Lewis pro- vides a catalog of birds through descriptions of their physical appearances and their songs, beginning with the mockingbird, known in the eighteenth century as the "mock bird." Though Lewis does not name the bird, he pro- vides visual and auditory details in the structure of a riddle, whereby the reader is invited to "see" and identify the bird. He describes its gray color- ation with a white chest, and also emphasizes its most telling characteristic, the ability to mimic the songs of other birds (73-84). Lewis's description allows readers to compare the mockingbird to its English counterpart, the nightingale, a gesture that Lemay interprets as another sign positioning the</page><page sequence="12">52} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 poem vis-à-vis colonial promotional literature designed to attract British immigrants to the colonies (4). Indeed, Lewis hints that the mockingbird is superior to the nightingale in song repertoire and scale range. He "Runs thro' all the Notes!" (89), and his sound convinces his listeners that he is the very bird he imitates; the English nightingale, in contrast, lacks such versatility. However, Lewis's hyperbole is balanced with scientific accuracy, specifically by his apprehension of the bird through his senses. Lewis again employs close observation and hyperbole in his descrip- tion of another exclusive native to the Americas, the hummingbird, which he identifies as superior to all other bird species. The hummingbird reigns over other birds as "their beauteous King" (119), with its brilliant, irides- cent colors appearing and disappearing as a "living Rainbow" (113). Though the "Smallest of Birds" (112), it "flings" its "Ten thousand Colours" (99): Now I behold the Em'rald's vivid Green, Now scarlet, now a purple Die is seen; In brightest Blue, his Breast He now arrays, Then strait his Plumes emit a golden Blaze. (100-03) The narrator s enthusiasm for the visual effects of the hummingbird s plumage reveals his affinity with the New Science methodology of his era. Richard Beale Davis notes Lewis's connections to the Royal Society and his collections of specimens; his scientific bent suggests knowledge of the works of natural historians from continental Europe's previous two cen- turies: Conrad Gessner, Ulissee Aldrovandi, Johan Christian Fabricius, and Volcher Coiter. Almost certainly he had heard of John Lawson, the author of A New Voyage to Carolina, whose briefer prose description of a hummingbird finds some salient parallels with Lewis's. With his Royal Society connections Lewis was probably familiar with the work of British naturalists Francis Willughby and John Ray. When science and art are used to frame nature, the human scientist- and artist-framers inevitably take a defining role, thereby raising the specter of anthropocentrism; yet the same gesture makes possible an ecocentricism, due to the focus on more- than-human aspects of the nature being depicted. Hence the bird descrip- tions in the poem reveal both anthropocentric and ecocentric inclinations. A likely influence on Lewis's bird descriptions appeared in 1728 when British native Mark Catesby began publishing his serial monograph The</page><page sequence="13">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 53 Natural History of Carolina. , Florida , and the Bahama Islands. Beth Tobin identifies Catesby as engaging in early eighteenth-century natural history practices that "attempt[ed] to capture a plants ecological relations" (182), in contrast to the later practices defined by the Linnaean system of univer- salizing nomenclature, which specifically sought to remove the plant from its ecological context and thereby render it available for imperial appro- priation. Catesby and Lewis share the impulse toward recognizing ecologi- cal relationships and systems. Like Lewis, Catesby corresponded with Peter Collinson and others associated with the Royal Society, beginning dur- ing the nine years Catesby spent in the adjacent colony of Virginia (Davis 846); this link, as well as parallels visible in their publications, opens the possibility that Lewis and Catesby may have known of one another's work. Catesby s book scientifically arranges and documents verbal descriptions of birds, each with Latin and English names, coupled with true-to-life watercolors conjoining birds with appropriate plants. His prints include names and descriptions of each American bird mentioned by Lewis: the lark, the turtle dove, the mockingbird (fig. 1), the hummingbird (fig. 2), and the hawk (fig. 3). Lewiss description of the hummingbird closely mir- rors Catesby 's, focusing on its array of changing colors and its iridescent, "metallic resplendency" (Catesby 65); both liken the size of the humming- bird to that of the bee. A more complex parallel between Lewis and Catesby concerns their re- spective representations of a hawk diving to catch a fish. The first plate of Catesby s volume 1 (fig. 3) depicts the trio of hawk, eagle, and fish in the air (during which the eagle secures the fish away from the hawk). Catesby s accompanying prose indicates that the eagle usually 4 compels the Hawk to let [the fish] fall, which the Eagle seldom fails of catching before it reaches the water" (2). He emphasizes the irony of the hawks self-defeating behav- ior: "It is remarkable, that whenever the Hawk catches a Fish, he calls, as if it were, for the Eagle, who always obeys the call, if within hearing" (2). In contrast with Catesby s lively scene, focusing on its three subjects in com- bat and surrender, Lewiss passage erases the eagles thieving interference: But see the Hawk , who with acute Survey, Towring in Air predestinates his Prey Amid the Floods!- down-dropping from on high, He strikes the Fish , and bears him thro' the Sky. (207-10)</page><page sequence="14">54} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 figure i. Mark Catesby " The Mock-Bird " From Natural History. Courtesy The Lilly Library Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana. The narrative omission of the eagle from Lewis's poem is puzzling, but de- cipherable as another (anxious) flattening of the power structures func- tioning in the landscape, like that of the "Monarch-Swain" Lewis's hawk, soaring above the earth, has both "acute Survey" and panoramic vision, not unlike the divine perspective (and in a lesser sense, Lewiss own atop a horse, itself atop a hill). A powerful sky figure, the hawk swoops to earth and in a single moment "strikes" the hapless fish. The image of imminent and unexpected judgment befalling the vulnerable fish foreshadows the prayer at the poems end and the narrators anxiety about his own spiritual fate. At that moment Lewis's narrator will refer to himself as God's "wretched Creature of a Day ' (364), and will question whether he might not after all "Sink total into Death, and never rise again!" (371). Lemay notes Lewis's theodicy in the hawk passage, as the verb "pre- destinates" calls to mind the Calvinist doctrine that humans do not choose their final destinies (143). Yet the narrator's supplications, "Snatch me some Angel to those high Abodes" and "Take me, my great CREATOR to Thy Care " (257, 380), may render an alternative and more hopeful ending to the</page><page sequence="15">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 55 figure 2.

Thus the invisibility of the eagle in Lewis might be accounted for within the poems streamlined theodicy: Lewis positions the hawk as God and the fish as man, versus Catesby s competitive trio of eagle, hawk, and fish. Similarly, Lewis's hawk and fish episode suits his tendency toward poetic binaries of plantation/wilderness, day/night, and life/death, but only by repressing the presence of the competing species of the eagle.

The repression of competitive prédation between species, in favor of seeing the hawk as successfully positioned at the top of his food chain, aligns with the rest of the poem s depiction of successful habitation of the landscape, which is achieved by repressing the intrahuman and interspecies politics of the landscape. The presence of the predatory hawk illustrates a distinction between two types of nature in the poem, the domesticated nature of the planta- tion and the uncontrolled and potentially threatening nature of the wilder- ness. The narrators observations of both cultivated and uncultivated trees heighten this distinction. With dawn breaking at the commencement of the journey, "The Trees, emerging, rear their dewy Heads" (25), parallel- ing the narrators own awakening. The generic "tall trees" are reworded</page><page sequence="17">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 57 in British publications of the poem to specify the species as "Pines" (20 in the Weekly Register version). The pale yellow color of the new (male) pollen cones that appear on pine trees in spring, particularly when back- lit by the morning sun, might have inspired this image of the pine trees being set on fire at sunrise, thereby suggesting the role of careful scien- tific observation combined with artistic discourse in the poem s treatment of the trees, as well as the birds. These sun-dappled trees, in fact, become emblematic of the entire journey, both the event and the poem, as they "kindle in my Breast poetic Flame, / And bid me my CREATORS praise proclaim" (38-39). Similarly, the fruit trees enter the scene with corporeal (anthropomor- phic, but not anthropocentric) features, and inspire one of the poem s few olfactory descriptions: "lofty Cherry-Trees erect their Heads," with blooms whose "Evolving Odours fill the ambient Air" (66, 69). The smell produced by these trees brings delight to both man and bird, as do their "Delicious Fruits-!" (63). All five orchard trees named in the poem ("The Peachy the Plum, the Apple here are found; / ... The lowly Quince yon sloping Hill o er- shades" as well as the "lofty Cherry-Trees' [62, 65, 66]) are species familiar to both American and British audiences of the period (Langford), thereby associating the passage with the known qualities of place. However, once again Lewis has redrawn or idealized the landscape. In contrast to this image of stately and upright healthy trees, the typical Maryland landscape was often blighted by the clear-cutting and girdling practices (described below) of tobacco production, reminders that the territory inhabited as domesticated nature was recently wilderness. The narrator s progression from place into space marks the first major transition in the poem; this movement from the known to the mysteri- ous, and from the peaceful to the anxious, occurs at the midpoint of the journey and introduces the thought that humans cannot in the space of the wild exert the level of control shown in the domesticated nature of the farm. Highlighting this difference is a human structure found on the edge of the wilderness, which offers a contrast to the " Monarch-Swains " snug cottage on the plantation; as a storm breaks over the wilderness, the rider s only shelter is a "lone House which opens wide its Door" (146). This "lone House" represents the minimal safety of survival within the freedom of space, rather than the long-term security of place. However, the place- ment of this "lone House" in the wilderness raises questions unanswered</page><page sequence="18">55} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 in the poem: Whose house is it? Why is the door open and untended in the middle of the day? Why does the narrator feel free to enter this house without invitation, in contrast to the "Monarch-Swains" cottage which he respectfully admires, and imaginatively enhances, from a distance? Lemay posits a range of symbolic (and unsatisfying) answers as to "what sig- nificance the Tone House' has- is it religion, nature, friendship?" (142). Lemay s options only raise further questions: How can the "lone House" be "nature" while still offering protection from the storm, itself an embodi- ment of human inability to control nature? How can the lone and vacant structure be an image of friendship? Instead of enacting Lemay s metaphors, the "lone House" parallels the poems invisible horse. The transition from plantation to wilderness traverses an ecotone of highly significant political and ecological conse- quences. Settlers in the region saw the woods surrounding their planta- tions as future plantation space; "[a]t any given time, a planter cultivated only about a tenth of his farm, leaving most of his domain heavily forested" (Taylor 145). Yet given the soil- exhausting properties of the tobacco plant, growers routinely abandoned fields to seek new ground every few years, which meant clear-cutting or otherwise appropriating wooded landscapes for planting purposes. Sometimes settlers followed the forest-to-farm for- mula without the trouble of clear-cutting; instead, farmers merely "girdled" trees, "cutting a strip of bark around each ... to curtail its circulation. Girdled trees persisted as ugly hulks deprived of their leaves, permitting the sun to reach plants cultivated around their dead roots" (Taylor 145). The consequences of these practices marred Marylands landscape. Visi- tors from England "saw a wasteful landscape of straggling farms, girdled trees, rotting stumps, flimsy and unpainted houses, impermanent fences, weedy fields, and scrawny, neglected livestock" (Taylor 145). The differences between this eyesore landscape and the contrasting claim of the landscapes ability "to heal the aching Sight with cheerful Green" could hardly be more pronounced. Yet the meaning of the "lone House" must be read in the minimal overlap between these two disparate accounts of the land. Given that the "lone House" is positioned in the eco- tone linking the outskirts of the plantation with the vast stretches of wood- land, at least two possible answers emerge. The structure might well belong to a common white planter who attempted to carve a plantation out of the woods and who either is away from home laboring in the afternoon or has</page><page sequence="19">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 59 abandoned the house after failing to farm the area successfully. Alterna- tively, the structure might well have been abandoned by a member of the native peoples, such as the Algonquians with whom colonists traded for deerskin or the Susquehannock, two groups that occupied the Chesapeake region before being driven out as a consequence of Nathaniel Bacon s Re- bellion of 1676 (Taylor 149; Wood 63-64). Mark Catesby's discussion of Native Americans reveals that on occasion he spent the night in a native dwelling; he describes the dwellings he encountered in nearby Virginia in terms that resemble Lewis's "lone House" (particularly the door "which opens wide" and the structure s ability to provide shelter and safety "till the Storm is ore" [147]): "lhe Wigwams, or Cabbins of the Indians are generally circular or oval . . . afterwards covering them all over, both Roof and sides, with Bark ... so that they are warm and tight, and will keep firm against the weather. ... [I]n the sides is left a Hole or two for Light, and a Door at one End"8 (x-xi). The location of this house in the woods reflects the practices of native dwellings being "sprawled over the land- scape amongst woods and open space" ("Tsenacomoco"). Lewiss other poems express awareness of Native American displacement from the land- scape, and eerily echo this passage in "Journey." "Food for Criticks," for ex- ample, speaks of a deceased "Indian prince" who "cant in death his native groves forget" (lines 105, 107). The narrator of "Journey," in contrast, fails to see even imaginatively the landscape 's former history. Whether the "lone House" represents evidence of displaced native peoples or (suspended) cul- tivation by white settlers, Lewiss narrator apprehends the structure solely within his individual and immediate need to weather the storm in space. Tuan notes, "[i]n open space one can become intensely aware of place; and in the solitude of a sheltered place the vastness of space beyond acquires a haunting presence" (54). In this case, the "haunting presence" of those who previously occupied the "lone House" is pronounced for the modern critic but elided by the poet. From the relative safety of the "lone house," the narrator observes a vio- lent storm, during which lightning strikes ... a Wound, On yon toll Oak! - Behold its Top laid bare! Its Body rent, and scatter 'd thro' the air The Splinters fly! (149-52)</page><page sequence="20">60 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 The oak species would be familiar to both American and British readers, both as a resource and as a symbol of English national identity. The destruc- tion of the personified oak is total amid the storms remarkable violence: "Down rushing fall the Trees, and beat the Ground / In Fragments flie the shatter 'd Limbs around" (160-61). This description of arboreal waste and destruction is the closest image offered in the poem to the actual results of clear-cutting, banding, and other ecodestructive practices of colonial Maryland agriculture. But the narrator attributes this destruction solely to natures overwhelm- ing powers, displacing onto the arboreal environment feelings of dread, gloom, and trembling ("the gloomy Grove," "shatter'd Limbs," "Tremble the Under- woods" [159-62]). These images, conjoined to the empty, lonely house in the dark woods, raise the specter of the ecogothic (Smith and Hughes), sending a chill across the Maryland landscape that anticipates the narrator s spiritual crisis at nightfall. Tom Hillard, referring to the ar- rival of the first Puritans at Plymouth several generations prior to Lewiss poem, notes that "the 'hideous and desolate wilderness' was an experience fraught with spiritual significance" (111, 113). Lewiss narrator experiences such an anxiety when he rereads nature as a coping mechanism for his spiritual crisis. His exposure to the storm reduces him to an insignificant element within natures power, though he remains too engrossed in obser- vation to internalize its implications until later reflection. When he does so, an anxiety emerges that was only hinted at during the experience of the storm, particularly because the narrator anthropomorphizes the destroyed tree. Personalizing this experience, along with that of the fish caught by the hawk, the narrator sees himself " To-morrow doom'd a Prey to ruthless Death!" (349) and "in thTmmensity of Nature lost!" (353). As his anxieties mount, the narrator asks, "must I, when I quit this earthly Scene, / Sink total into Death , and never rise again?" (370-71). Situated within natural forces larger than himself, the narrator perceives the dangers and freedom of space, in turn evoking fears of mortality. The veiled acknowledgments of the invisible yet present Africans and Native Americans (and even the horse) augment this fear of annihilation. In the morning, the narrator lightheartedly distinguishes himself from the indolent pigs, but otherwise spends the day finding commonality with nature. He subsumes his horses identity into his own; he sees a poet in the mockingbird; he stretches his head to the sky in tandem with the trees.</page><page sequence="21">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 61 However, at nightfall, he strains to see himself as distinguished from ma- terial nature on the basis of possessing a "never-dying soul " capable of "active Thoughts that penetrate the Sky" (373-74). Only when thoughts of his own mortality plague him does he grasp at superiority over nature, at egocentrism over biocentrism. However, this shift isn't singular, uni- directional, or unrecoverable in the poem. Mimicking the cyclical pat- terns of light and darkness, the poem s beginning prefigures its ending, even as the events and emotions of the morning foreshadow the evening s crisis. lhe figures rendered as invisible during the day, the tobacco plant, the repressed servant, the harrowed native, the oppressed slave, even the threatening eagle, become unseen shadows of the narrators own fear of being rendered invisible within the darkening landscape, a fear of being "in th'Immensity of Nature lost!" NIGHTTIME TERRORS*. THE POEM'S NARRATOR IN SPACE While Lewis's narrator exhibits some anxiety as a result of the first major transition in the poem, leaving behind the comforts of the plan- tation to face the terrors of the wilderness, the second major transition, at nightfall, is a moment of significantly increased tension. With sunset, darkness eliminates the narrator s powers of material observation, which have served as a coping mechanism through the journey, leaving him to rely solely on his skills of spiritual insight. The need to cross the Severn by boat necessitates the narrator s dismounting (or so we assume), and posi- tions both horse and rider in the unstable position of ferrying across the river. Given the poems conflation of the day s journey with the journey of life, the Severn here doubles as the river Styx, or perhaps the Acheron (Marambaud 142). This is the moment in the poem when space, both literal as in the darkened heavens of the canopy above and the black water of the Severn below and figurative as in Tuan s usage, most forcefully asserts itself upon the narrator s mind; his thoughts catapult his gaze upward toward the little remaining light offered by the stars in the night sky, and generate a level of spiritual anxiety that threatens to forestall the narrators efforts to interpret his journey. The overwhelming presence of the unknown future drives the spiritual anxiety of the poems final section, during which the narrator turns from seeing nature to reseeing it, from apparent objectivity to blatant subjec-</page><page sequence="22">62} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 tivity. The effort to comprehend nature, rather than reassuring the narra- tor of his ability to apprehend his environment and control its depiction, suggests how much more there is to know; study of nature, in other words, leads inevitably to the realization of human insignificance in the universe, and ultimately to an increased awareness of the certainty of death. The narrators rereading of his day s journey as a parallel of his life jour- ney results in a dramatic shift in mood. Most of the poem has embraced a confident, joyful state of mind; the moment he contemplates his own thirty-year existence, however, he perceives he has been "Blest with few Joys, [and] perplex'd with numrous Cares" (286). Furthermore, positive moments of his journey now take on negative connotations. "Whole lofty trees," representing fields of study to the schoolboy, now induce "grief" (293). The journey through the wild, earlier acknowledged as merely lonely, is now "tedious" (295). So nature, which represented the security of place in the daytime, figures as a space of spiritual exile at night. The comfort provided to the narrator by nature when it was visible has been twisted into torment when its materiality melts into invisibility: "These Thoughts, which thy amazing Works suggest, / Oh glorious FATHER, rack my troubled Breast" (355-59). The narrator s subjectivism in his nighttime rereading of the day s events appears most clearly in his use of the storm image. A storm is an obvious metaphor of life's troubles, yet during the daytime the narrator does not express fear as he stands in the doorway of the abandoned house, appar- ently ignorant that his own horse might benefit from comfort as thun- der crashes and tree limbs fall. Instead, he appears convinced of his own safety. The storm fascinates him, especially when its outcome is "pleasing . . . Rain" (169), and even more so when the "triumphant" return of the sun provides the scene with its climax: a rainbow (175-77). While Lemay interprets the rainbow as evidence of Lewis's interest in optics (141-42), the rainbow should also call to mind its biblical predecessor at the end of Noahs deluge. As such a symbol, the rainbow signifies hope, and the promise of Gods interest in human affairs. Rather than being simply light refracted, the rainbow transforms the light of the sun, already associated in the poem with God (and seen reflecting iridescent rainbow-like colors off the hummingbirds breast); it suggests Gods presence, much like the bib- lical prophet Elijahs experience of a still, small voice following a similarly catastrophic storm (1 Kings 19.12).</page><page sequence="23">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 63 So while the experience of the storm invites contemplation of human mortality via the anthropomorphic oak, the violence witnessed does not cause the narrator mental distress; thanks to the shelter of the lone house, he functions as an observer of the storm, not a victim of it, calmly resum- ing his journey when the weather clears. Only at nightfall, when the nar- rator allegorizes the story, does he question his own equilibrium in the face of threats to his existence. Contemplating the "tempestuous Troubles" of the long-past storm (302) fills the narrator with grief and deforms his awareness of things previously termed "Delights" (199). Even the rainbow, which earlier refreshed and encouraged as a sign of the storm s demise, has less power when applied to the narrator s life; only "some Gleams of Com- fort rise" in the speakers heart, as "He hopes the Gust has almost spent its Force" (308-09). If the journey is an allegory of the narrator s life, he finds himself still in the storm, not yet confident that the rainbow signifies the end of troubles. The symbiotic paralleling of nature and human life during the day (figured in the images of the personified trees) gives way to a sym- bolic and androcentric reframing of nature at nightfall. In contrast to Johnson s assertion, Lewis does not articulate a "duality ... in nature, ... at once beautiful and terrible, enlightening and deceiving" (118). Instead, Lewis's duality is darkness and light, seeing and not seeing: with "th' Approach of Night, / Imperfect Images elude the Sight" (239-40). This division problematizes the narrator s self-perception: while seeing na- ture he can imagine himself in a godlike position, separate from nature, which he views from above; with nightfall his position within nature, vastly separated from a superior God, forces itself into his consciousness. Ulti- mately, he fits comfortably into neither category, nature nor divine spirit. Deprived of vision, Lewis's narrator experiences fear, for which the study of nature has not prepared him. His revision of the landscape is no longer sufficient to provide him a sense of control over his environment as, after sunset, his poetic vision becomes blurred with spiritual concerns. While Johnson notes that in Lewis "the observation of Nature yields divine understanding" (118), conversely, the poets inability to observe nature yields spiritual doubt. As darkness closes in, bird coloration and expansive vistas no longer captivate his mind and convince him of Gods beneficence; neither does he describe night sounds of cricket or owl, nor the linger- ing scent of tree blossoms. Instead, he turns his attention to the stars and moon, which are distant, colorless, and silent. Stars signify Gods remain-</page><page sequence="24">Ó4Ì EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 5I, NUMBER 1 ing control, since they are "Rang ci by their MAKERs Hand in just Array" (247), reminding the narrator that he is not the composer of the landscape he viewed in the daytime. Unlike the animals, birds, and trees, which are perceived as fellow creatures during the day, the stars are coldly detached from the narrators existence, serving instead as a marker of divine design. Contemplating the immensity of the universe leads the narrator into an intense burst of doubt and terror. "May I not justly fear," he asks, that his life may be confined to this world (350), like the beasts and birds observed during the journey? Perceiving the vast scope of the universe, might he yet be "in th'Immensity of Nature lost!" (353)? Might hopes of an afterlife be simply "Creations of my own Self-Love ," imaginings to hide from a "coward Heart" the reality of mortal human existence (355-56)? The narrator can- not be content merely to sleep and eat, like the swine he described earlier; instead, he sees himself lost and ignored in the universe, much as his own horse has become lost within the poem. Even the narrator s own revision of the history and the landscape documents the anxiety; nature seems to mirror the creator, but only shrouded, as if viewed through a glass darkly. Since nature is incapable of asking questions of eternal destiny, let alone providing answers, nature provides the narrator with little relief from eter- nal dread: . . . (perhaps to cheer my Toil) I see thin Verdures rise, and Daisies smile: Poor Comforts these, my Pain ťalleviate! (366-68) Nature viewed by daylight, the "cheerful Green" of the fields (50) and the "vivid Green" of the hummingbird (100), even the "eternal Green" of the river banks (205), cheered the rider; in the dark, however, nature s green fades to "thin Verdures," a mere shadow of the color green, unable to allevi- ate his pain. The choice of pluralizing "Verdures" here has the effect of em- phasizing the mere "shade or tint," and minimizing the concepts of fresh- ness and flourishing, as best reflects the narrator s reliance on sight and his anxious mood at its diminishment.9 Yet, the narrator asserts, even his doubts find their motivation in Gods creation; "thy amazing Works suggest" (358) the doubts regarding his posi- tion in the universe and the flow of time. The sole comfort available to him is the doubts themselves; such doubts must "issue from a never-dying Soul" (373)- To doubt is uniquely human, and an act of the mind; thus the doubts</page><page sequence="25">"In th'Immensity of Nature Lost!" { 65 resurrect the possibility that the narrators mind separates him from nature and aligns him with the divine. As "active Thoughts" (374), the doubts serve as evidence of ultimate meaning; human desire for "eternal Happiness . . . / Could never be bestow'd on Man in vain" (376-77). Such thoughts reduce the narrator to "humble Silence" (379). The anxiety produced by the narrator s lack of vision suggests that, for Lewis, night symbolizes the death of the mind, the aspect of himself which is most similar to his divine creator. While viewing the natural world through the light of God s sun, nature is enough in itself to contemplate; the speaker asserts his descriptions of nature during the day as belonging to a materialistic discourse. At night, the narrator responds to his loss of sight by requesting that God will "vouchsafe to view the Son of Man, / Thy Creature " (346-47), implying that if the narrator cannot see, he hopes at least to be seen. The poem performs at nightfall the very sensations of anxiety at the con- templation of death that the narrator describes but hopes to escape during his future demise. Still, he presumes the remainder of his life will follow the allegorical model, such that he may enjoy his life and approach death in peace, confident of eternal life. Yet even here, confidence appears frag- ile; death, he says, "shall (I hope) but strip me of my Clay " (329). Though parenthetical, the interrupting "I hope" weakens the certainty of the verb "shall." Thus Lewis ends his poem with his narrator addressing God, seek- ing to "sustain thy wise Decree, / And learn to know myself, and honour Thee " (389-90). The presumed death of Lewis at the age of thirty-three lends pathos to the poem s closing lines, given that his considerable appe- tite to see the world and know himself was so soon cut short. conclusion: nature, human nature, AND THE SUPERNATURAL " [T] o know [ones] self," in Lewis's "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapo- lis," involves seeing nature- the pigs, the hummingbirds, the lightning- struck trees- and through them, seeing the God of nature, but also seeing oneself uncomfortably inhabiting nature while reflecting the divine. At the same time, this form of self-knowledge requires repressing "the other" in order to achieve a harmonious and reassuring idealized (re)vision of the environment actually encountered. The humble "sot-weed" plant and its as-</page><page sequence="26">66} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 51, NUMBER 1 sociated debased landscape, the marginalized women, the oppressed slave, and the hunted native are rendered invisible in the landscape, in order to allow the poetic vision free reign to indulge its revisionary urges, which service the contradictory programs of colonial appropriation and ecologi- cal identification. The poem demonstrates that ecocentrism and anthro- pocentrism can coexist in a pre-Romantic era work written by a British subject, who endeavored to see the New World landscape yet also resorted to revising it. Through vision, revision, and invisibility, Lewis's narrator ac- commodates the beckoning and threatening aspects of the environment, which, paradoxically, he attempts harmlessly to inhabit and anxiously to appropriate. These acts of repression form a link between the poem s dual preoccu- pations with material description and spiritual investigation. The poem in- sists that to study nature is to study life and death, and the knowledge of death, ones own or that projected onto the other, carries the seeds of spiri- tual crisis. These descriptions of nature and spiritual crisis implicate the narrator in simultaneous acts of revelation and repression. Thus examining Lewiss "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis" demonstrates the value of proactively apprehending a works historical, political, and environmental contexts, particularly when the narrator proves unreliable in his presenta- tion of these contextual issues by his reimagination of them. Our reading illustrates the need to uncover that which is rendered invisible within a work s landscape so as to see most fully and therefore better understand what it contains. NOTES 1.
