International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 44: 53-66,1998. 53 Book reviews Editing A Companion to Philosophy of Religion was an unenviable task. Any format adopted has its strengths and weaknesses. I shall confine my comments to the format the editors have chosen. Part I: 'Philosophical Issues in the Religions of the World', and Part II: 'Philosophical Theology and the Philosophy of Religion' have considerable overlaps. Both would have been improved by a far more explicit discussion of different views about the relations between philosophy and religion; a discus- sion begun, promisingly, in William Wainwright's contribution 'Christianity'. Is the relation between them necessarily hostile? Is reason a preparation for faith, a way of understanding a faith already given, or an actual deepening of faith? In Christian medieval thought, Scott MacDonald tells us, "the Augus- tinian method of belief seeking understanding is taken for granted by the vast majority of Christian philosophers . . . including Anselm" (p. 82). The same is true in Islam, but there, Azim Nanji and Aziz Esmail point out, philosophy and religion are thought to provide independent knowledge of the cosmos. David Burrell brings out well how, in this respect, a tightrope is walked between philosophy and religion in Islamic medieval thought. In medieval Jewish thought, according to Tamar Rudavsky, the problem is not to buttress faith by reason, but to reconcile two distinct bodies of knowledge (p. 95). On the other hand, Lenn Goodman, writing more generally on 'Judaism', welcomes what he takes to be the collapse of philosophy as a meta-discourse, so that a genuine Jewish philosophy can be developed. His somewhat opti- mistic hope is that, despite internal differences, and ruptures of the faith by the likes of Spinoza and Freud, a purer language will emerge through a call for reconciliation (p. 54). The emphasis is different when Paul Griffiths reflects on Buddhism, since he concentrates on philosophical difficulties he finds in its central concepts. When Chad Hansen examines Chinese Confucianism and Daoism, and Kwasi Wiredu examines African religions, they wonder whether they meet cer-</page><page sequence="2">54 BOOK REVIEWS tain definitions of religion. The latter is tempted by reductive, sociological analyses. All this may encourage one to say, with Ninian Smart, that there is no philosophy of religion, only philosophies of religion and that these, as in Hinduism, vary even within a single religion. But what is really needed is more discussion of whether the kind of understanding philosophy can give is the same as religious understanding of whatever kind; a discussion which could have been pursued further in Kevin Flannery's 'Ancient philosophical theology'. This issue becomes acute in seventeenth and eighteenth century philoso- phy. Unfortunately, Derek Pereboom's discussion of Hume and Kant is rather thin. Hume's critique in his Dialogues cannot be met by an appeal to theism as an argument to the best explanation, since Hume, at his best, is ques- tioning whether it makes sense to speak of 'explanation' of 'the world'. I sympathise with Pereboom's task. Surely, Descartes, Hume and Kant, given their stature, should have been given separate treatment, especially given the space accorded to contemporary treatments of specific topics later in the Companion. In short, great philosophers deserve more attention than this. Having said that, Merold Westphal succeeds in highlighting the issues involved in post-Kantian philosophy of religion: the devastating conse- quences of Deism; the way Hegel rejects Kant's rationalism and Schleier- macher's experimental 'immediacy', ending up with his own conception of 'absolute spirit'. In these developments Westphal sees a search for a religion inoffensive to philosophy. Westphal also illustrates the desperate need for some distinctions between the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology. Authors in Parts I and II could have been given this brief, and even asked to respond to each other; not an impossible task given the amount of repetition in the present articles. On reflection, the editors might also conclude that the essays on modern philosophy would have sat more comfortably with those on twentieth century thought, than with the articles on medieval thought. Part III: 'Some Currents in Twentieth Century Philosophy of Religion' is a mixed bag. The titles of the last four articles on 'The reformed', 'The Anglican', 'The Jewish' and 'The Orthodox' traditions, suggest that the reli- gious location of the tradition determines the kind of philosophy practised, but, with the exception of the last, this is not the case. Paul Valliere brings out well that the emphasis on apophatic theology in Orthodoxy is not, as many have thought, the road to scepticism, but a purification of unworthy ways of thinking about God (p. 189). It would be intriguing to ask how many contributors to the Companion would be found wanting by these criteria. Robert Gibbs has illuminating discussions of Buber</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 55 and Levinas, but I do not think that their ethical emphasis on dialogical relations is essentially Jewish. Further, when Brian Hebblethwaite discusses a long string of thinkers, their being Anglicans is all talk of a tradition means. Hebblethwaite is fully aware of the differences between thinkers as diverse as C. C. J. Webb, W. R. Inge, A. E. Taylor, F. R. Tennant, I. T. Ramsey, Basil Mitchell, John Macquarrie, Richard Swinburne and Ninian Smart, but they make the grouping philosophically dubious. Also, not enough attention is given to the degree of influence different writers have had. 'Contemporary Empiricism' or 'Evidentialism' would have been better categories, given how dominant their assumptions remain. Nicholas Wolterstorff gives an excellent account of the reformed tradition, but although Calvin's influence is obvious, the philosophical critique of evi- dentialism is surely meant to stand independently, irrespective of the religious tradition in which it may have originated. The accounts of Process Theology by David Griffin and of Phenomenology and Existentialism by Merold West- phal are also excellent. I appreciated the way Westphal shows the rootedness of the latter movements in Kierkegaard's insistence that belief is more serious than Christendom's version of it, and in Nietzsche's insistence that unbelief is more serious than secular modernity had realised. On the other hand, I found Ralph Mclnerny's 'Thomism' overly factual, and thought a stronger case could be made for its contemporary forms. The articles on 'American pragmatism' and 'Personalism' by Nancy Frankenberry and Patricia Sayre are thorough, but represent movements whose influence in this context, but not in others, is, by their own admission, on the wane. The remaining article by John Hyman on 'Wittgensteinianism' is an edi- torial anomaly. The author is not, primarily, a philosopher of religion, so perhaps it is not surprising that he chose to duck his subject and simply concentrate on Wittgenstein. His account of the developments in Wittgen- stein's thought is adequate, but its application to the philosophy of religion is crude. Hyman sees little connection between Wittgenstein's insights in philosophical logic and his remarks on religion. I am not criticising Hyman for stating his views, of course, but the editors must be held responsible for not seeking the strongest statement of this position, as they have for other points of view. Since I hold the position in question, I may be accused of spe- cial pleading, but seasoned editors, not remotely Wittgensteinian, share my judgement. This editorial irresponsibility is repeated on two further occasions in the Companion, the next being in the following section. In the editorial introduction, we are told of Part IV: 'Theism and the Lin- guistic Turn': "It is often said that the linguistic turn has been the single most important development in twentieth century philosophy" (p. 2). It would be hard to see why from the articles in this section. What was needed, in</page><page sequence="4">56 BOOK REVIEWS this context, was a detailed discussion of positivism, linguistic philosophy, Wittgenstein's major influence, and the bearing of all this on the philosophy of religion. Instead, Michael Martin, in 'The Verificationist Challenge' con- centrates on finding an acceptable contemporary version of it. He repeats the groundless charge that Wittgensteinians believe that there can be no external criticism of religion. Reference to Wittgenstein is cursory in Janet Soskice's 'Religious Language' before attention is turned to Ian Ramsey. Most attention is given to Soskice's favoured topic of metaphor, interesting in itself, but not historically central in 'the linguistic turn'. She has, however, interesting, but all too brief, indications of developments of the theme in Continental and post- modern philosophy. The bearing of that 'linguistic turn' on realism is meant to be explored by Roger Trigg, but, sadly, he does not appreciate the logical issues involved. In response to Wittgenstein's critique of 'belief construed as a mental state logically cut off from the surroundings in which beliefs have their sense, Trigg says, lamely, "this is the whole point of realism. What we have beliefs about is not meant to be logically related to them" (p. 217). Trigg could make nothing of Wittgenstein's insistence that what we need is realism without empiricism. For a scholarly contrast, see James Conant's discussion of realism in his introduction to Hilary Putnam's Words and Life. Part IV, then, affords no informed discussion of Wittgenstein in a context in which it should have been prominent. As Wilde's Lady Bracknell would have said, 'To miss one opportunity is a misfortune; to miss two is sheer carelessness'. I would have followed Part IV with Part VI: 'The Justification of Religious Belief and Part VII: 'Challenges to the Rationality of Theistic Belief. The actual Part V is on 'The Theistic Conception of God'. My general misgiving about many of the papers is that the particular attribute ascribed to God is discussed abstractly, as though its sense were clear, and only then discussed in relation to God. I had these misgivings about Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz on 'Omnipotence', Edward Wierenga on 'Omnipresence', Linda Zagzebski on 'Foreknowledge and human freedom', and George Mavrodes on 'Omniscience'. To give but one example: the tendency I have in mind leads Mavrodes to say: "Most theologians who accept the doctrine of the omniscience of God would probably not think themselves committed to the claim that God - a non-embodied being - has the neuromuscular skill of riding a bicycle . . . They would think that God knows every fact there is to know about bicycle riding" (p. 237). What has this to do with religion? This is the result of not beginning with the significance of those religious contexts in which it is said that we are known by God, and cannot hide from him. We could then avoid the misplaced picture of billions of unuttered true proposi- tions lying dormant in the divine mind. I wonder how many contemporary philosophers of religion would see the joke if someone concluded, on hearing</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 57 that, with God, the hairs of our heads are numbered, that God must know the number in each case? Other papers, more promisingly, begin with what is of religious signif- icance. I would like to have seen Christopher Williams on 'Being' dwell longer on the difference between a philosophical interest in the existence of 'all things', and the existence of God, a task from which his admiration for Frege should not excuse him. Eleonore Stump on 'Simplicity', and Brian Leftow on 'Eternity', begin with what is uniquely sayable of God. Simplicity involves four claims: "(1) God cannot have any spatial or temporal parts. (2) God cannot have any intrinsic accidental properties. (3) There cannot be any real distinction between one essential property and another in God's nature. (4) There cannot be a real distinction between essence and existence in God" (p. 250). These considerations could have been developed further at the end of William Mann's article on 'Necessity'. It is interesting to note that they were held by "philosophers and theologians in all three major monotheisms ... as foundational for understanding the divine nature" (p. 250). Equally interesting to note is that the eternity of the nature was thought of as time- lessness rather than as endless duration (an incoherent notion, anyway) in a tradition which "reigned unchallenged from Augustine to Aquinas" (p. 257). But, given the anthropomorphism rampant in contemporary philosophy of religion, it is no surprise to hear that now these notions have more enemies than friends. The central issue is: how can spiritual truths, eternal verities, be mediated in finite lives? Patrick Sherry on 'Beauty' emphasises the importance of concen- trating on the beauty of the divine, since many aesthetic concepts simply do not apply to God. Paul Helm on 'Goodness' does not start with a specifically religious morality, but with the familiar Euthyphro dilemma. By his own admission, this leads to inconclusive results. Charles Taliaferro on 'Incor- poreality', Thomas Tracy on 'Divine Action', Hugh McCann on 'Creation and Conservation' and Richard Creel on 'Immutability and impossibility', all illustrate the conceptual tightrope which has to be walked between showing the relevance of eternal spiritual realities in human life and not succumbing to anthropomorphism. The problem is not, as Tracy thinks, one of "profound limits to imagine and express the notion of timeless existence" (p. 302), but, as Kierkegaard's work illustrates, of clarifying the grammar of 'divine reality', a concept which has a use like any other. The abiding influence of anthropomorphism leads Creel to conclude that, in his involvement in human affairs, God is emotionally 'touched', but not emotionally 'crushed' (p. 318). In Part VI: 'The Justification of Religious Belief, Clement Dore, William Rowe and Laura Garcia work through the difficulties connected with the ontological, cosmological, teleological and design arguments, respectively.</page><page sequence="6">58 BOOK REVIEWS But if these are part of a tradition in which belief seeks understanding, it would have been good to discuss the features of religious beliefs these arguments were trying to capture. I do not concur with Garcia, any more than I did with Pereboom, in the suggestion that design arguments are strengthened when they become arguments to the best explanation. In fact, this takes us further away from the religious significance of creation. Neither do I agree with C. Stephen Evans that these arguments are cumulatively effective as a group. In his 'Moral Arguments' a failure to acknowledge the heterogeneity of morals, comparable to that in the work of Robert Adams and Swinburne, prevents due attention being given to specific religious moralities. Jeffrey Jordan gives a thorough account of 'Pragmatic arguments' and their relation to other epistemological positions. His discussions of Pascal and William James are informative, but the neglect of Peirce is surprising. While George Schlesinger provides an account of familiar difficulties in relating miracles to scientific laws, there is insufficient discussion of what it would be to regard an inexplicable event as a miracle, that is, as revealing the divine. Keith Yandell, in 'Religious Experience', does not think that internal relations between concepts and experiences guarantee their objective reality. There is insufficient discussion of what it would be to confess this reality, and of whether there are conceptual restrictions on claims to have 'explained' an experience. The latter issue is vital in a critique of reductive analyses of religion. Alvin Plantinga, on 'Reformed Epistemology', gives a good account of the critique of evidentialism and the claim that a non-circular justification can no more be given of religious belief than of our belief in other minds. Plantinga's more recent work is reflected in the claim that our beliefs have warrant when our cognitive faculties are working properly - a suggestion which seems as helpful as explaining sleeping pills by ascribing dormative powers to them. The hold of empiricism is still strong in this appeal to faculties in epistemology. Terence Penelhum on 'Fideism' discusses the claim that faith is not answer- able to reason. He identifies Tertullian and Kierkegaard as radical fideists, and has good things to say about unhelpful appeals to 'paradox' in religion. How- ever, he misses the sense in which Kierkegaard is engaged in grammatical elucidation in his pseudonymous works and how he thought philosophy's contribution to 'the monstrous illusion' in Denmark was to turn religious belief into a philosophical thesis. Penelhum brings out well how fideists can become allies of sceptics who emphasise the limits of reason. We can be passionate about what is true. Fideism's unfortunate legacy is the view that we can only be passionate about what is uncertain. On the other hand, in dis-</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 59 cussing the hiddenness of God, Penelhum is in danger of turning a religious mystery into an epistemological mystery. Once again, the neglect of Wittgenstein in a section on justification in inex- plicable. With Reformed epistemology, in the philosophy of religion, it is the major critique of evidentialism. One critique is present, why not the other? More generally, in logic and epistemology, Wittgenstein is central to dis- cussions of 'where justifications end'. In this context, Wittgensteinians have criticised the view that Plantinga's 'noetic structures' or Alston's 'doxastic practices' can themselves intelligibly be regarded as systems of beliefs. There is only a passing reference to Wittgenstein in Penelhum, unfortunately in terms of a discredited 'Wittgensteinian fideism', and we have repeated the by now inexcusable mistake that Wittgensteinians hold "that religious discourse has its own logic that can only be appreciated by a participant" (p. 376). Slight problem: Wittgenstein was not a participant. So much for the central thesis of Wittgensteinian fideism! As far as the discussion of Wittgenstein in this Companion is concerned, if one were Demea, one would have long departed. In Part VII: 'Challenges to the Rationality of Theistic Belief, it seems to me that Michael Petersen in 'The problem of evil' is entirely successful in his objections to theodicies which, of necessity, seek to justify evil in terms of some 'greater good'. He notes that to meet these difficulties "process theists reject the classical concept of omnipotence" (p. 400). It would be interesting to hear Petersen 's reaction to a thinker, such as Simone Weil, who, while agreeing with all his criticisms, provides one of the deepest discussions of affliction in Christian thought. In 'Naturalistic explanations of theistic belief, Kai Nielsen argues that reductive analyses by Feuerbach, Engels, Marx, Nietzsche, Durkheim, Freud and others are effective, cumulatively, in showing that the reality beneath religious symbols is not what believers take it to be. But there is little attempt to meet criticisms of these analyses which challenge them on their own terms. Similarly, when Antony Flew, in 'The Presumption of Atheism', rehearses conceptual difficulties with theism made familiar in his writings, the pre- sumption which needs examining is whether he does justice to the grammar of other religious possibilities. He is locked into the same assumptions about theism made by philosophical theism. Given that we live in a largely secular culture, it is remarkable that this is the shortest section of the Companion. A complacency, born of Christian philosophers of a certain kind, simply talking to each other, may hide the disturbing lack of discussion with the wider philosophical community. This was not true of discussions in the fifties, sixties and seventies. Surely, the major thinkers Nielsen is asked to discuss merit greater attention than they</page><page sequence="8">60 BOOK REVIEWS are given here. Editorial restriction, in this section, increases the impression of the religious, apologetic character of the Companion. In Part VIII: 'Theism and Modern Science', the need for scientific approval often threatens the grammar of religious beliefs. Is justice done to belief in God as creator in speculating, with William Craig, whether "God existed prior to the big bang in metaphysical time, which is distinct from physical time", or in suggesting that God as cause "of the big bang could be simultaneous with it"? (pp. 421-422). Would the challenge to religion discussed by William Hasker in 'Theism and evolutionary biology' be stronger if we gave up the unwarranted assumption that physicalism is the only alternative to theism? A range of alternative explanations are explored by Robert Audi in 'Theism and the scientific understanding of the mind', but are they all on the same logical level? Aren't some of them philosophically confused? Finally, in 'Theism and Technology', Frederick Ferre suggests that our ecological concerns may lead us to realise that theism has something to say about the wholeness of the environment in face of the instrumental values of our technological culture. Some of the best essays in the Companion are to be found in Part IX: 'Theism and Values'. In 'Divine Command Ethics', Janine Idziak emphasises how God's commands have their sense in a religious context. They are not meant to be an abstract definition of morality. Again, in 'Natural Law Ethics', Robert George emphasises that natural laws are not that for the sake of which actions are done, but provide parameters of what is to count as good reasons for actions. For Aquinas, natural law both belongs to and is the source of human nature. But, in 'Virtue ethics', Jean Porter reminds us that if we see virtues in the context of communal relationships, those relationships vary and do not form a single pattern. Theologians often ignore this heterogeneity when they speak of Morality. This theme is developed by Robert Roberts in an excellent paper on 'Narrative ethics'. With the decline in the Enlightenment ideal of universal reason, more attention is paid to specific narratives. Roberts makes an important distinction between narratives which exemplify virtues, and narratives which themselves determine the grammar of what is to be called a virtue. Religious narratives are typically of this latter kind, calling on the reader to adopt this perspective. But this perspective is one among many in our culture and in our own lives. In 'Agapeistic Ethics', Gene Outka asserts, rightly, that more discussion is needed of how agape relates to other loves in our lives. Similarly, in 'Theism, Law and Polities', Paul Weithman discusses the difficulties of arriving at a public philosophy in the pluralistic culture which followed the breakup of Europe as a unified spiritual community after Protestantism and the growth of secular liberalism. Perspectival differences are evident within and outside religion, as evidenced in James Childress' 'Theism and Medical Ethics', Gary Comstock's 'Theism and environmental</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 61 ethics', and Edward Langerak's 'Theism and Toleration'. No easy answers are embraced. Part X, devoted to 'Philosophical Reflections on Christian Faith', again raises the need to discuss the difference between theology and the philosophy of religion. David Brown on 'The Trinity' emphasises the conceptual prob- lems involved, but some indication is needed of what religious difference it makes if one goes in one direction rather than another. Ronald Feenstra on 'The Incarnation' discusses Hick's claim that Chalcedon turned devotional language into metaphysical language, but Hick's alternative which reduces Christ to a powerful example of God's influence is no more satisfactory. It would have been good to hear more of the view that God emptied himself of his divinity in the Incarnation, a powerful theme in Simone Weil's writings. In 'Sin and Original Sin', Philip Quinn is exercised by difficulties involved in regarding sin as a genetic endowment. He concludes that we are only responsible for acts we freely commit. This ignores the possibility that sin is 'original' in the sense that it enters our very conception of our moral endeavours and our need for grace. This latter possibility is explored by John Hare in 'Atonement, Justification, Sanctification' in discussing the moral gap between what we are and what we ought to be. Whether discussing Kant or Kierkegaard, the issue is whether their account of that gap is satisfac- tory. These issues are linked with Jonathan Kvanvig's 'Heaven and Hell'. He spends too much time discussing unworthy 'externalist' accounts of hell, and only late in his article comes to the deeper conception of hell as the permanent loss of God. Similarly, Thomas Flint, in 'Providence and Pre- destination', spends too much time on issues concerning freedom and God's foreknowledge, expressing dissatisfaction with ascribing 'middle knowledge' to God. Late in his discussion, but insufficiently developed, is the connection between predestination and the destiny of the human soul. Flint discusses disputes between Calvinists and universalists. It would have been interesting to put Wittgenstein's comments on predestination alongside them. The topics discussed by Quinn, Hare, Kvanvig and Flint could have been included, with profit, in Part IX: 'Theism and Values'. Interestingly, Stephen Davis' article is called 'Survival of Death' not 'Eternal Life', the assumption being that the latter entails the former. Davis concludes that God can secure that the memories of the person who survives death are correct, even though that person, 'Jones', has been constructed of entirely new matter 'in a completely Jones-like way" (p. 560). I do not see how such a restructured being could be Jones or have his memories. A memory must correspond to what happened. What happened to Jones did not happen to his look-alike. Whatever mental occurrences the restructured 'Jones' has, they logically cannot be Jones' genuine memories.</page><page sequence="10">62 BOOK REVIEWS In 'Petitionary Prayer', Eleonore Stump wrestles with whether such prayer is pointless given divine foreknowledge. I'd have liked more discussion of the Kierkegaardian insight that prayer does not change God, but changes the one who prays. In 'Revelation and Scripture', William Abraham explores the interesting question of what happens when the Bible is not received as author- itative, but is made the object of an intellectual investigation whose yardsticks are secular. These issues are connected with Basil Mitchell's discussion of 'Tradition' and the importance of Newman's conception of 'antecedent pre- suppositions' within traditions. Of course, we are still faced with competing traditions. That fact is linked to themes in Part XI: 'New Directions in Philosophy of Religion'. In 'Feminism', Sarah Coakley has important comments to make on masculine conceptions of divine power, but more criticism is needed of wilder theses from French feminism, for example, "that even the child's entry into the linguistic realm constitutes a repression of a primal 'feminine' creativity associated with the material identification of the breast-feeding phase" (p. 603). In 'Religious pluralism', John Hick rehearses views made familiar through his writings. He has a devastating criticism of W. P. Alston's attempt to combine the view that our experiences give us good reason to trust them, with the conviction that his Christian experiences, as opposed to the experiences of those in other religions, are true. This means that his first view about experience only works, where religion is concerned, with respect to his own religion and no other. Hick presents his own Kant-like solution to the problem of religious pluralism which, it seems to me, repeats, in his own case, the mistake he accuses Chalcedon of: that of turning devotional aspiration into metaphysics. In the last article of the Companion, Paul Griffiths discusses 'Comparative Philosophy of Religion'. He distinguishes between philosophers who discuss religion as a genus, and those who tackle puzzles arising from particular religions. Some treat religions in a hierarchical way (Hegel), but this is not necessary (Hick). Griffiths looks to a constructive philosophy of religion in which key concepts in different religions will open up new possibilities for us. But I should also like to see a discussion of a philosophy of religion which aims at a dialogical and conceptual sensibility which transcends the differences between belief and unbelief; achieving this without recourse to evidentialism or the negative apologetics of Reformed epistemology. In fact, its aim would be one of understanding, not apologetics. In attempting to name every contributor to the Companion, an aim which in itself is open to criticism, I have not done justice, of course, to matters discussed by contributors which are other than those I have mentioned. I</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 63 can only appeal to an even greater restriction on space than they must have experienced. The opening claim of the editorial Introduction is that as well as engag- ing specialists, "This Companion is a guide to philosophy of religion for nonspecialists" (p. 1). That it most certainly is not. One's reaction to what it is, will depend, of course, not simply on the directions in which one's own enquiries have taken one, but on one's conception of what philo- sophical enquiry amounts to. For this reason, on being asked whether the Companion reflects modes of argumentation which dominate contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of religion, optimists and pessimists alike will reply, 'It certainly does'.
