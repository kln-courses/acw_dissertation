<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Measure of the Moon by Ralph B. Baldwin; 488 pages; $13.50; The University of Chicago Press, 1963. In the author's words this book forms a sequel to, not simply a revision of, his 1949 work The Face of the Moon. Bald win very clearly states in the introduc tion that a meteoritic origin for the great majority of craters and the large circular maria is accepted as correct and that the book will contain no attempt to prove or disprove this idea. The book is basically divisible into four sections containing several chapters 446A</page><page sequence="2">each, although the author does not draw attention to this subdivision. The first section discusses meteoritic structures on earth and forms a worthwhile intro duction to the moon's surface, as well as a valuable summary of investigations and information on the known and probable terrestrial meteoritic craters and crypto volcanic structures. The second section is concerned entirely with craters and discusses the char acteristics of explosion craters, ter restrial meteoritic craters, and lunar craters; the relationships between ap parent diameter, true diameter, rim height, rim width, apparent depth, true depth, depth of explosion, depth of brecciation, and the possible changes in these parameters with age; and the de termination of energies needed to produce meteoritic craters. The third section deals with observations on the moon's motion and shape and the deter mination of the nature of lunar-surface materials by reflected light and the use of heat measurements at infrared and radio frequencies. The fourth section attempts to summarize the ideas of various workers, including those of the author, on the origin and development of a variety of pertinent lunar features. A separate chapter is devoted to each of the topics which include tektites; theories of moon history; maria; lava flows; lunar atmosphere; rays; craters with central peaks; rifles, wrinkles, and faults; lunar grid system; domes; heat balance; magnetic field; and recent changes on the moon. An initial chapter outlining the problems of lunar history and a final summation chapter complete the text of the book. Appendices include derivations of the relationship between the distance of the moon and geologic time, and the lunar tidal bulge as a function of the moon's distance. A set of tables forms the bulk of the appendix and gives detailed data of craters on both the earth and moon, as well as those produced by chemical and nuclear explosions. Baldwin brings to this book a long continuing personal background of ex perience in lunar problems, and the de tailed and abundant references to the literature reflect this background.

The chronological listing of investiga tions occasionally makes it difficult to follow Baldwin's line of reasoning. Pre senting older or incorrect data first, before the significance of the measure ments are made known, is confusing to the new reader. Common throughout the book are anthropomorphic or folksy expressions. Occasionally, these expressions are in teresting, but usually they suggest that the author is uncertain of the real nature or cause of what he is describing. Several astronomical terms or abbrevia tions are used in the text without defini tion. ?Carl Bowin</page></plain_text>
