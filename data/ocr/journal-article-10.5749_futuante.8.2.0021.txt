Courtesy of Eric Fischl. </page> <page sequence="2"> Karen Lang Eric Fischl’s Tumbling Woman, 9/11,  and “Timeless Time” What has come to be called 9/11 is considered a “major  event.”1 Jürgen Habermas has defined 9/11 as “the first historic  world event in the strictest sense,” since the terrorist attacks  on the twin towers in New York and on the Pentagon in Wash- ington, D.C., “literally took place in front of the ‘universal eye- witness’ of a global public.”2 Habermas’s designation captures  both the global scope of 9/11 and the media’s role in its repre- sentation and dissemination. It also alerts us to the perception  of 9/11 as a defining moment. It should come as no surprise to  say that in the United States the government worked this event  to its advantage, and that it did so by cementing the events  of September 11, 2001, to an inexorable agenda to defeat  “terrorism.” If the term “9/11” has contracted the history of  the  September 11 terrorist attacks to a nodal point, then “ter- rorism” has been deployed to cast nations and their citizens  into the Manichean extremes of good and evil, west and east,  democracy and terrorism, and to justify war accordingly.3  Philosophers have recently shown how these deployments  purposefully avoid “facing the conceptual complexity” that  underlies the notion of terrorism.4 In the United States, official  uses of terrorism—of the word and of the practices implied— have fortified notions of sovereignty and nationalism that are  dangerous and outmoded. What these philosophers have  called for in their stead is an affirmation of the Enlightenment  ideas of world citizenry and cosmopolitan right, in which, to  use the words of Giovanna Borradori, “all members are entitled  ‘to present themselves in the society of others by virtue of  their right to the communal possession of the earth’s surface.’  As soon as such a community is in place, a violation of rights  in one part of the world would be felt everywhere.”5 The state  of universal community is one in which lives become “more  equally grievable,” and hence “more livable.”6 The urgency  of recent philosophical reflection on the events of September  11, and the unfolding of these events into the present and the  future, raises the question of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum,  as it is now officially named. The narrower question of a 9/11  memorial that could convey the past to the future might itself  be ripe for philosophical reflection.  Adriana Cavarero has also pointed to the need for a finely  Future Anterior Volume VIII, Number 2 grained naming of contemporary violence of the sort witnessed  Winter 2011 on September 11. She agrees that names and concepts such  21 </page> <page sequence="3"> as “war,” “war on terror,” “terrorism” and “hyperterrorism” are  “vague and ambiguous,” that they “evoke concepts from the  past,” and that they do not unmask power. What is more, these  abstract categories, “made even more rigid by ideological  simplification,” offer no weight to “the singular lives of human  beings,” all the more so “when they are defenseless.”7 Hor- rorism is Cavarero’s name for violence against the helpless.8  Horrorism focuses attention on the victims of atrocity and on  the repugnance that arises at the sight of bodies disfigured,  dismembered, and undone. Shifting the attention from concep- tual vagaries to human vulnerability is timely and imperative,  Cavarero rightly notes, for “it is the defenseless person without  qualities, interchangeable and random, who takes the center  of the contemporary stage on which the specialists in violence  against the helpless perform.”9  In contrast to terrorism, which brings to mind the threat  of death, the sight of horrorism “is characterized by a particu- lar form of violence that exceeds death itself.”10 The sight of  bodies pulled apart induces a state of paralysis, “and each  victim is affected on its own. Gripped by revulsion in the face  of a form of violence that appears more inadmissible than  death, the body reacts as if nailed to the spot, hairs stand- ing on end.”11 As at the sight of Medusa’s severed head, so at  the spectacle of horrorism, the beholder freezes and recoils.  Indeed, the scene “turns darker and, although more discon- certing, paradoxically more familiar” when “a woman steps to  the front of the stage of horror.” Cavarero acknowledges that  “the misogyny of the patriarchal imaginary” obviously plays a  part here. Nonetheless, as the myth of Medusa “already knew,”  horrorism required the feminine—the face of a woman—“in  order to reveal its authentic roots.”12  In terms of the viewer, Cavarero has in mind the way horror  tears at the vulnerability of the individual eyewitness, the way  the spectacle of disfigurement warns or reminds the beholder  that he or she is a singular body. Ontological dignity resides in  human singularity. When bodies are stripped of their singular- ity, the human condition itself feels under threat. Death bears  the loss of individuality (and of the individual person), but the  human condition is the bearer of singularity, or the condition  of being a singular body. As such, the human condition is also  predicated on particularity, for to be singular is to be irreduc- ible, in some way, to generality. Horrorism not only shifts the  attention to the defenseless and to the human condition of  being a singular body; it also brings human particularity to the  center of the contemporary stage, and it does so through the  instance of human vulnerability. Cavarero shows that “the es- sential alternative inscribed in the condition of vulnerability” is  “wounding or caring.” Exposed to the viewer in its vulnerability,  22 </page> <page sequence="4"> “the singular body is irremediably open to both responses.”13  Again, we must pay heed to distinguish the individual and  the human condition—the individual bears its own, corporeal  vulnerability, but the human condition is the bearer of vulner- ability in relation to the other.14  Monere (the Latin root of the word “monument”) means  to warn or to remind.15 If a monument is intended to warn or  to  remind a public, then the form and style most suitable to  invoke the monument’s message becomes a rather open-  ended question in modernity, when artistic form has been  uncoupled from ideal style and subject matter from referential  meaning. In the case of 9/11, the “first historic world event,”  the stakes of commemoration are as high as the mandate is  conceptually diffuse. Apart from the fact that this commemo- ration will include a memorial, meaning a monument to those  who perished in the attacks, what, exactly, is the public to be  warned or reminded of in the commemoration of September 11?  As a concept, terrorism is imprecise. Horrorism is more precise  conceptually, but it invokes repugnance. Finally, there lingers  the toothful question of suitable form and style.  “For those who erect it, as for those who receive its mes- sages, the monument,” notes Françoise Choay, “is a defense  against the traumas of existence, a security measure. It is  the guarantor of origins, allaying anxieties inspired by the  uncertainties of our beginnings. Antidote to entropy, to the  dissolving action of time on all things natural and artificial, it  seeks to appease our fear of death and annihilation.”16 The  perception of the monument as “a security measure”—against  time, decay, and annihilation—has an impact on the erec- tion and preservation of monuments. Choay indicates how  this perception safeguards “our beginnings” by preserving  intact a sense of origin. The events of September 11 struck at  the heart of America’s sense of its democratic origins, usher- ing in a general, and new, sense of contingency in the United  States. It would behoove us to consider whether a memorial  to 9/11 reveals these blows and uncertainties, or enfolds them  in a monument that serves as “a defense against the traumas  of existence.”  Richard Drew snapped an iconic photograph at 9:41:15  on September 11. Titled “The Falling Man,” it depicts one of  at least two hundred people dubbed “jumpers” by the press,  who either jumped or fell to their deaths from the collapsing  upper floors of the World Trade Center in New York City.17 In at  least two instances, newspaper stories commenting on Drew’s  photo graph attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who  found the image deeply disturbing. (On the Internet, “The  Falling Man” took on viral life.) Understandably, images such  as this were among the hardest to bear. Meanwhile, television  23 </page> <page sequence="5"> viewers in the United States were swamped by the image of  the towers’ collapse. Media repeat and political drumbeat re- inforced and fabricated enormity—not surprisingly, the events  of September 11 were quickly cast in algebraic terms, as 9/11.18  In a book review in Artforum in January 2002, Sarah Boxer  alluded to a paradox in the representation of 9/11. “The events  of September 11, 2001, were beyond measure,” she began.  “But when the day ended, the visual limits were fixed.”19 How  can events beyond measure have fixed visual limits? As the  visual engorged itself on the towers’ imminent collapse, in the  press and in political rhetoric that dividing line was drawn be- tween good and evil, east and west, democracy and terrorism.  Recalling Choay’s description of the monument as “a security  measure,” that dividing line and fixing of visual limits indicates  the way the constitution of acceptable visual imagery can serve  as “a defense against the traumas of existence.” The visual  limits of 9/11 obviously included the collapsing towers. Drew’s  “Falling Man,” by contrast, was clearly beyond the pale.  “The public sphere is constituted in part by what can  appear,” Judith Butler has argued, “and the regulation of the  sphere of appearance is one way to establish what will count as  reality, and what will not.”20 To prohibit figurative representa- tion is to render the human form unsayable. One may dissent to  this premise, citing the “Portraits of Grief” series—those back  pages of the New York Times lined in photographs of those who  had died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, along with  loving anecdotes about them. Yet these photographs were,  and are, reminders of the dead. However affecting, however  mournful, and those who perished must be grieved, these are  photographs of the individuals who can be named.  It is the nameless, and the human, condition of particular- ity that is rendered unsayable when figurative representation  of the human form is prohibited. This may appear as its own  paradox, since naming ushers in particularity. From the point  of view of the human condition, however, the name—like the  type and the stereotype—is a cover over a deeper condition  of particularity. The human condition of being a singular body  is that deeper condition. When Butler argues that the other  must be deemed living before it can be grieved, she invokes  the other that can be named and the other that cannot be  named. The human condition of particularity, the condition of  being a singular body, extends to every person. The qualities  of this condition may be difficult to capture in language, but  they may be felt in actual or aesthetic experiences of the body  under threat. Aesthetic experience is one container for the pain  of the world, and aesthetic recreation of human suffering can  critically appropriate the past in the present to convey truths of  reality otherwise unsaid. 24 </page> <page sequence="6">  “Why,” Bill Brown has asked in his book Things, “did the  emotional response to the loss of built space, after 9/11, come  to exceed the response to the loss of human lives, the towers  having become something like the lost object as such?”21 One  answer to Brown’s question surely lies in politics and ideology,  in the fact that the United States has been most accustomed  to waging war elsewhere and to viewing it, sanitarily, at home.  If the twin towers symbolized the center of the free, capitalist  world, then this world had been brokered on actualities and  myths of conflict endlessly elsewhere. When elsewhere ap- peared at home, for real, the sheer magnitude and force of the  collapsing towers, like the knowledge (tacit or otherwise) of in- jured and dead victims, gave rise to an impression of events  beyond measure. In the forming of this impression, note how  endless repeat of the collapsing towers coursed alongside  censorship of images of the victims. Perhaps the paradox of  9/11 and its representation—the reason why response to the  loss of built space came to exceed response to the loss of  human lives—lay in a desire to imagine and a desire not to  see.22 Architecture enables the imagination of concepts and  ideas, whereas figurative representation conveys ideas through  human form. Like the imagined Freedom Tower looming above  ground zero and its unearthed victims, architecture can bury  human beings in the service of grand ideas, whereas figura- tive sculpture brings the human and the human form onto the  center of the contemporary stage.23  A year before September 11, the American artist Eric Fischl  took pictures of a model tumbling around on the floor of a  studio. After losing a close friend who had been trapped in the  towers, he worked for nine months on Tumbling Woman, an  over- life- size figurative sculpture, before casting it in bronze  as a memorial to 9/11. In October 2002, Tumbling Woman was  installed in the lower concourse at New York’s Rockefeller Cen- ter. One week later, public outcry resulted in its removal. Jerry  Speyer, the owner of Rockefeller Center, had received bomb  threats, and Fischl had been criticized for ambushing “grieving  New Yorkers with the very distillation of their own sadness.”  For Fischl, Tumbling Woman is a memorial to the “extrem- ity of choice.”24 The artist considers the choice of whether to  plunge from the collapsing towers on its own, terrifying terms.  In contrast to Drew’s iconic photograph, which pits free fall  against the scale of the towers’ facades, Fischl’s sculpture  offers no measure apart from itself. The over- life- size form  of Tumbling Woman suggests the significance of its content.  Scale, the impact of the sculpture on the viewer, can be  gauged only in aesthetic experience.  For all its naturalism, Tumbling Woman does not depict  an individual person, let alone a jumper. To the artist, the  25 </page> <page sequence="7"> sculpture “feels like a dream in which somebody is floating.”  As he points out, there is “no weight there that is sending this  crushing, rippling current back through the body as it hits a  solid mass.”25 As a memorial, however, Tumbling Woman does  refer to September 11 and to the experience of those events.  A tension between the general and the specific is part of what  renders this just-o ver- life- size sculpture monumental in scale.  Tumbling, floating, in free fall, Fischl’s memorial imagines  related extremities, which is to say that it brings these into  existence aesthetically: the breathless scale of the twin towers;  the magnitude of 9/11; speechless responses to the events.  Vulnerable, corporeally and in relation to the other, Fischl’s  memorial also imagines the human condition of particular- ity. If Tumbling Woman confronted “grieving New Yorkers with  the very distillation of their own sadness,” it invited them to  imagine not only the individual victims but also a human con- dition of particularity that would include and exceed those who  perished. Still, Tumbling Woman seemed to have appeared  too soon to be considered as anything other than “a piece of  grim, plastic photojournalism.”26 These circumstances may  explain the public’s reaction to the sculpture, but it can be ar- gued that the aesthetic experience of Tumbling Woman drives  deeper still.  Tumbling Woman references an event that is said to have  divided time into past and future. In style and subject, Fischl’s  memorial is poised on that dividing line. Tumbling Woman  26 </page> <page sequence="8"> conveys the grace of the dream state and the gravity of bodily  movement, the self- possession of repose and the exertion of  limbs into space. Any lightness is offset by the dense, down- ward thrust of weight palpable in the bronze. At the same time,  modeling gives the surface a varied appearance, suggesting  the touch of the artist—molding, scraping, tearing the plaster  in the process of rendering. Light flints in and ricochets off  the worked surface of the bronze. The figure’s awkward pose  creates valleys of shadow. Exposed and vulnerable on the one  hand, hidden and insouciant on the other, Tumbling Woman  complicates rather than simplifies. Knowing the sculpture’s  relation to September 11 compounds this impression, as does  the sculpture’s female form.  Tumbling Woman arises from the tradition of modern  French sculpture. Like Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol,  Fischl employs classicizing female form and he inhabits clas- sicism in order to unmake it. In Fischl’s memorial, a reality  principle has replaced the coupling of female form to time- less essence or eternal truth. The beautiful appearance of the  sculpture is this reality principle, and it suggests an event and  its rippling effects as the shattering and suspension of time,  history, categories of thought, and standards of judgment.  In Fischl’s memorial, legs and hands work in counterpoint to   arrest us, cautioning or prohibiting our approach, and draw- ing us near. Limbs seem to have a life of their own, splaying,  reaching, jabbing, pulling away from the figure’s spine like  27 </page> <page sequence="9"> blades beginning their whirl. The torso of the figure provides  an anchor. Yet here, too, the sculpture heaves, threatening  to ply itself apart. Coincidentally, a delicately rendered hand  is positioned near the figure’s chin. This hand signals lack of  pressure and with it, the seeming dream state within which the  figure tumbles.  Tumbling Woman exists for itself and in relation to the  beholder. Moving around the figure in the direction of the  outstretched hand, the viewer strains through limbs and a  landscape of rendered flesh to find a human face. Coming into  view through the porthole of a body whose mechanism appears  to have sprung, this face is somehow surprising. The figure’s  neck disappears in this angle of view, the space between head  and torso consequently foreshortened, making the condition  of the body difficult to discern. What is certain: the face feels  entombed by its body. This face, this seeming condition of the  body, dilates aesthetic experience. Like the sculpted body be- fore the beholder, time opens up like a fan to enfold sensations  of surprise, unease, horror. This appearance of a human face  would be somehow surprising without the memorial’s reference  to 9/11. Set in relation to September 11, the memory of human  vulnerability quickens and extends the sculpture’s effects.  Faces and hands express the vulnerability of the human  body and the human condition, for they are the bearers of  gesture. Tumbling Woman’s outstretched hand can appear   sentimental only after the view of the face through the body of  28 </page> <page sequence="10"> the sculpture. That hand plays its part, however, for it persists  as a solicitation. A memorial to touch, the outstretched hand  warns or reminds us of our capacity to wound or to care. That  hand exists on its own aesthetic boundary, then, for the ges- ture of wounding or caring is contingent, as open to the past in  the present as it to the future.  Tumbling Woman invokes an unredeemable now—a now  wherein history and vulnerability lie suspended between the  once alive and the soon- to- be- dead; the here and the for- merly; reality and dream. Hannah Arendt defined the present  as a “standing now,” as a “gap in the continuum of time.”  The standing now of the present is a “timeless time,” a gap  between past and future “in the sense that it is the mentally  experienced battleground of the infinite forward- pushing force  of the ‘no longer’ clashing against the infinite backward- driving  force of the ‘not yet.’” Arendt’s construal of the present as a  gap in time, a timeless time, resembles the time and space  of aesthetic experience. Akin to Immanuel Kant’s conception  of the sublime, the standing now of the present “appears to  the human mind as an abyss when there is no longer a bridge  of inherited concepts to traverse it.”27 A relation between the  Kantian sublime and 9/11 has been drawn in philosophical  reflection.28 This relation may be resisted, however, since ter- ror—rather than horror—is the pivot of the sublime.  Like Kant’s rendering of aesthetic experience, Arendt’s  notion of the present as a standing now liberates the faculty  29 </page> <page sequence="11"> of judgment. In the Kantian sublime, reason comprehends,  which is to say that it draws together or takes hold of, uncer- tainty. The Kantian sublime occasions feelings of terror and  constraint, but the laws of reason provide the measure and the  means by which to domesticate what had initially overwhelmed  the imagination. In Arendt’s standing now, on the other hand,  the thinker, equidistant from past and future, experiences  the ruin of traditional standards of judgment and the conse- quent inability to latch onto the laws of reason as a means  by which to subsume particulars under universals. In that  sense,  Arendt’s standing now feels to the thinker like a kind  of negative sublime. Akin to the Kantian sublime, then, the  abyss Arendt describes commences in an overpowering of the  imagination; in contrast to Kant, however, this abyss endures  as a gap in the continuum of time. A standing now.  An understanding of the present as a timeless time, and  of the thinker or beholder as stranded in a gap opened up in  the continuum of time, liberates the faculty of judgment, but  it prevents judgment’s conclusions. Stranded itself between  past and future in Arendt’s standing now, judgment cannot  subsume particulars under universals, nor can it use univer- sals to comprehend particulars. Foiled in its inexorable drive  toward conclusion, judgment is invited instead to exercise its  labors on behalf of particularity. Particularity is essential to  what A rendt calls “a human condition of plurality,” which as- serts “the existence of a kind of beings essentially irreducible  to one another, beings who reveal their distinctness from one  another, and their distinct points of view to one another.”29  Aesthetic judgment as a scanning of particularity underlines  the straining toward humanness as an unending labor that is  a hallmark of the Kantian sublime. In this instance, however,  humanness is not accorded through the labor of reason but  through the unending labor of according dignity to human  particularity.  Particularity and contingency are faces of a coin. Tumbling  Woman exists on the dividing line, the aesthetic boundary,  of this coin. In praise of hands and face, Fischl’s memorial  invites the straining toward humanness as an unending labor.  Tumbling Woman offers an aesthetic experience of contingency  in which the dignity of particularity—the particular condition  of being a singular body, the particular vulnerability that arises  from that condition—is all that remains when beauty is mere  appearance and categories of thought and standards of judg- ment are in ruin. Perhaps this is why Tumbling Woman would  be a fitting memorial to the extremities of September 11. But  perhaps, also, horror of free fall in every sense, invoked in and  through the aesthetic experience of a vulnerable human form  that solicits the beholder’s intimate engagement, is extreme,  30 </page> <page sequence="12"> and so we turn away. Yet to do so would be to close out the  conjuncture of our present.  In 1863 the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire  called for a modernism in keeping with his sense of modernity  as “the ephemeral, the fugitive, and contingent, the half of art  whose other half is the eternal and the immutable.”30 By 2001  we had surely landed on the ephemeral side of the coin of  modernity, and postmodernism announced that arrival. Target- ing a world turned representation, the spectacle of enormity  etched in the towers’ collapse and the endless repeat of that  spectacle as representation appeared as a perfect illustration  of the point of postmodernism.31 It could be argued that the  monumentality of the proposed Freedom Tower, like the gigan- tism of most of the proposals for the commemoration of 9/11,  sought a match with this major event through size, if not scale.  The equation of enormity in scope and monumentality in size  may reinforce the algebra of 9/11, but it does not necessarily  convey the individual experience of September 11.  Fischl’s memorial does not represent an event, 9/11, so  much as it touches on individual experience of the events  of September 11, and it does so by reminding us of human  particularity. It also reminds us that in an age of representa- tion, when concepts as fuzzy as terrorism have become crisply  delineated, packaged in generalities for facile consumption,  the straining toward particularity is indeed an unending labor.  Tumbling Woman exists beyond the pale of visual representa- tion of 9/11 in two senses then: the sculpture’s subject and  form defies the proscription against representation of the  human figure; and the sculpture’s solicitation, the aesthetic  experience of intimate engagement it occasions, defies the  penchant for enormity—and with it, for a kind of certainty— in politics, in media representation, and in thinking itself.  Like Arendt’s posing of the thinker in a timeless time be- tween past and future, Fischl poses Tumbling Woman and the  viewer on an aesthetic boundary. In both instances, judgment  remains an open question. And that is precisely the point. For  Arendt, writing after the Holocaust and in the time of totalitari- anism, accenting particularity in her definition of the human  condition was essential in order to counteract ideological and  rhetorical certainties on the one hand, and on the other, the  exploding of “our categories of political thought and our stan- dards for moral judgment,” which Nazism and totalitarianism  had brought to light.32 For Fischl, the contingency of September  11 and the shattering and suspension it occasioned was the im- petus for aesthetic recreation. The brief lay in finding an artistic  means with which to evoke both sides of the coin of modernity,  the immutable and the contingent, and to do so in a way that  neither succumbed to tradition nor set itself apart from it. 31 </page> <page sequence="13">  In The Signature of All Things, Giorgio Agamben shows  how the past arises out of history “only when archaeological  inquiry has completed its operation.” “The moment of arising,  the arche ̄ of archaeology . . . therefore has the form of a past in  the future, that is, a future anterior. . . . It is the past that will  have been when the archaeologist’s gesture (or the power of  the imaginary) has cleared away the ghosts of the unconscious  and the tight-k nit fabric of tradition which block access to his- tory.” The past that will arise in the future anterior is not simply  the past that has been neglected or effaced. Rather, archaeol- ogy gains access “to the present for the first time” by seeing in  the present the future in the past.33  In the case of 9/11, “the first historic world event,” the  contemporary and the historical are intertwined, for as they  say, 9/11 “made history.” Much has recently been made of  contemporaneity—of the experience of life as an ever- changing  moment in a world of über- complexity; of the sensation of   riding alongside any particular now, wherever one may be— and 9/11 has been invoked as a signal event of contempora- neity. In some theories of contemporaneity, globalization is  perceived as the engine of incessant change, fraying any quaint  sense of universality into a diaspora of particularities.34 As  liberating as this diaspora may appear, however, these par- ticularities are themselves entangled in the capitalism that has  created them. Like the individual or the name, globalization’s  diaspora of particularities is a veneer over a deeper relation:  whereas the human condition of particularity rests on a notion  of singularity, the global condition of particularity is a hall of  mirrors that masks a deeper relation of similarity, since here  particularity is wrought through forces of capitalism whose job  is to create the ever new. Like capitalism, contemporaneity  draws the globe into a conceptual space of the now that not  only veils “a collision of temporalities,” but also offers precious  little space outside itself.35 In the time and space of a perennial  present, the sun never sets on “endless war against terror,” nor  does the “first historic world event” of 9/11 ever really become  historical.  It is only when history, including the history of aesthetic  objects, floats free of contemporaneity that we may begin to  understand the past historically, which is to say with Agamben,  the past that will have been. Arendt’s notion of “timeless time”  defines the present as a gap in the continuum of time, a space  of suspended judgment in which particularity and singularity  may emerge to contravene similarity and generality. Casting the  events of September 11 in algebraic terms, as 9/11, either has  inflated the small numbers or it has buried them.36 Particularity  will arise out of the generalities of 9/11 only in the future ante- rior. Meanwhile, Fischl’s memorial to September 11 may warn  32 </page> <page sequence="14"> or remind us of the human condition of singularity entombed  in narratives of the terrorists and the “jumpers,” or the victors  and the vanquished.

Wil- liam McCuaig (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), 2–3, 85. 8 Cavarero points out (ibid., 2–3) that violence against the helpless has been known  in the Western tradition for millennia. Nevertheless, this violence has a particular  quality that must be named: “Beginning with the biblical slaughter of the innocents  and passing through various events that include the aberration of Auschwitz, the  name used is ‘horror’ rather than ‘war’ or ‘terror,’ and it speaks primarily of crime  rather than of strategy or politics.” 9 Ibid., 74. 10 Ibid., 32. 11 Ibid., 8. 12 Ibid., 14. 13 Ibid., 20; Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence  (London: Verso, 2004), chapter 5. 14 That the scene “turns darker” when “a woman steps to the front of the stage of  horror” is perhaps on account of the dual fact that the vulnus—the wound, the  vulnerability—of the human being is initially open to the maternal figure and that  the newborn is not yet encased in the individuality of the “I,” but still open and  exposed to the wound the other may inflict. Saying this does not necessarily define  the maternal figure as a woman, for the role of caretaker may be performed by  either sex. It is only to say that in the mythological imaginary, as in the patriarchal  imaginary, the maternal figure has been construed as a woman and that this imprint  plays its part in horrorism. See Cavarero, Horrorism, 21–22; Butler, Precarious Life,  Chapter 5. Aron Vinegar has reminded me of the relation between the vulnerable  body and preservation in Plato’s Philebus, where the body, pierced and in pain,  solicits its preservation. Andrea D. Fitzpatrick explores vulnerability and represen- tation in “The Movement of Vulnerability: Images of Falling and September 11,”  Art Journal 66, no. 4 (2007): 85–102. Part of her project “is to extend the notion of  subjectivity to the dead, to show how they are acutely vulnerable to representa- tional violence” (86). 15 A. Ernout and A.

Commenting on newspaper front pages,  Boxer notes that about “100 of the 150 or so front pages compiled in the book  [September 11, 2001: A Collection of Newspaper Front Pages Selected by the Poynter  Institute (Kansas City, Mo.: Andrews McMeel, 2001)] include some image of that  moment [when the second plane penetrated the south tower]. (The foreign papers  were more likely to print pictures of the collapse, the ruins, and, in two cases,  people jumping or falling from the towers).” 20 Butler, Precarious Life, xx. 21 Bill Brown, ed., Things (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), 7. How  the loss of built space came to exceed the response to the loss of human lives is  beyond the scope of this essay. We may nonetheless note the way that, in the early  1990s, the bodies of soldiers and victims became absent from the media represen- tation of the Gulf War in the United States. 22 It also lay in the inability to imagine: “ ‘The most important thing I will never  know,’ Ms. Alderman said. ‘I won’t know how much he suffered and I won’t know  how he died. I travel back into that tower a lot and I try to imagine, but there is no  imagining.’” Kevin Flynn and Jim Dwyer, “Falling Bodies, a 9/11 Etched in Pain,”  New York Times (September 10, 2004). 23 Bodies and buildings have long been associated, of course. See, for instance,  Alina Payne, From Ornament to Object: Genealogies of Architectural Modernism  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012); and on 9/11, see George Lakoff, “Meta- phors of Terror,” in The Days After (University of Chicago Press online anthology,  http://www.scribd.com/doc/6015469/George- Lakoff- Metaphors- of- Terror). But I  would argue that the conveying of ideas in figurative representation is distinct from  the anthropomorphic relations between human body and building. One way to ac- count for this difference would be to note the human condition of being a singular  body. The collapsing twin towers might warn or remind us of human frailty, yet this  spectacle is distinct from the horrorism of the body’s undoing, which brings into  view what Cavarero has called “the singular lives of human beings.” Regardless of  whether a primordial relation can be said to exist between bodies and buildings,  the imagined Freedom Tower above ground zero demonstrates how architecture  can mask that relation. 24 Junod, “Falling Man,” 180.

Walter Benjamin’s concept  of an active remembrance (Eingedanken), though differently inflected, turns on the  relation between history and the future anterior. See, for instance, “On the Image of  Proust,” trans. Harry Zohn, in Selected Writings/Walter Benjamin, vol. 2, 1927–1934,  ed. Michael Jennings, Howard Eiland, and Gary Smith (Cambridge: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1999), 237–47.

For Smith, globalization creates the complexity and simultane- ity of the present time. Other scholars characterize contemporaneity by tensions  in time and space. In An Anthropology for Contemporaneous Worlds (Stanford,  Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1999), Marc Augé examines a double movement  of universalization and particularization at work across the globe today. See  also Hans Belting, “Contemporary Art as Global Art: A Critical Estimate,” in The  Global Art World: Audiences, Markets, and Museums, ed. Hans Belting and Andrea   Buddensieg (Ostfildern, Germany: Hatje Cantz, 2009), 38–73. 35 Harry Harootunian, “Remembering the Historical Present,” Critical Inquiry 33 no.  3 (2007): 474. As Harootunian rightly states (485), “It was the absence of periodicity  demanded by capitalism that rendered invisible the coexistence of multiple tempo- ralities in the present and their claims on both the past and the future.” September  11 has followed the logic of capital and contemporaneity by relocating Americans  “within a new temporal architecture that declared the removal of an antecedent past  from the present, history from its future. The nation was forcibly induced to embark  upon an unprecedented, endless war against terror, and its citizens were persuaded  to accept the imperative of living a new reality in a perennial present” (471).  Here we should note the way the “massive accumulation and proliferation  of apparatuses . . . in our time corresponds to the equally extreme proliferation in  processes of subjectification.” Giorgio Agamben, “What Is an Apparatus?” (2006),  in What Is an Apparatus, and Other Essays, trans. David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella  (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2009), 15. This subjectification would  appear to turn instrumental reason, and subjectification through instrumental  reason, on its head: subjectification in the time of a “massive accumulation and  proliferation of apparatuses” (including “terror”) entails reaction rather than reflec- tion, or instant response in a world of the ever now. 36 Arjun Appadurai, The Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger  (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2006). 35 </page> </plain_text>
