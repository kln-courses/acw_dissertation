<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes in the Early Iron Age. JEANNINE DAVIS-KIMBALL, VLADIMIR A. BASHILOV, LEONID T. YabloNSKY, editors. Berkeley, CA: Zinat Press, 1995. 443 pages, 490 illustrations, $48.50. ISBN 1-885979-00-2. Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes in the Early Iron Ages is an overview of the archaeology of the nomadic peoples who dominated the steppe region of Eurasia in the first millennium B.C.E. Early Nomads1 is one term used to designate a number of populations inhabiting relatively discreet regions of the steppe; because they shared in common a significant number of cultural indicators, they are usually considered to reflect a single cultural layer, if not a single ethnicity and language. Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes is divided into several sections, each authored by one or more scholars, and each dedicated to the major nomadic groups associated with a specific steppe zone. These sections include, respectively, the Scythians of the North Caucasus, of the steppe region north of the Black Sea, and of Crimea (authored by V.G. Petrenko, A.I. Melyukova, and V S. Olkhovsky); the Sauromatians and Sarmatians of the eastern Russian steppes and the southern Urals (M.G. Moshkova, V.V. Dvornichenko, Z.A. Barbarunova, and M P. Abramova); the Central Asian Saka (L T. Yablonsky); the Early Nomads (here called 'Scythians') of South Siberia (N.A. Bokovenko); and the Early Nomads of Mongolia (V.V. Volkov). Each contributing scholar has an established</page><page sequence="2">1 20 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) reputation within the former Soviet Union as an archaeologist or historian of the Early Nomadic period. Each section includes maps and extensive drawings; all bibliographical sources are included in one Bibliography at the end. However, despite the unified topic and format, the sections in this collection vary greatly in the quality of information conveyed and analysis. Since the readers of Mongolian Studies would be most interested in those sections which relate to Mongolia or to cultures neighboring Mongolia, this review will focus on the sections three through five. However, a few general comments regarding the volume as a whole are in order. The goal of the book is clearly stated in the 'Foreword' by Jeannine Davis-Kimball: ". ..to provide English readers with an overview of the Early Iron Age archaeological research in the U S S R, primarily between 1960 and 1990," the period of the most intense archaeological investigations in the former Soviet Union (p. vi). To a certain extent, this volume fulfills its mission: there is no other study in any non-Russian language which so fully covers the archaeology of the cultures commonly grouped together under the rubric, 'Early Nomadic,' or 'Scytho-Siberian.' However, within this broad overview there are some curious inclusions and omissions. The rationale for including an extensive section on the late Sarmatians but excluding anything but a mention of the Yuezhi is not made clear. Nor is it apparent why this volume includes no discussion of the Xiongnu and their confederation of nomadic peoples. Both the Yuezhi and the Xiongnu represent late but very important expressions of the Early Nomadic culture. Here, as elsewhere, one senses that the choice to include or exclude relevant material appears to be fortuitous, the result of the authors' specific interests rather than of an overarching, guiding vision. The essays in the book focus on material culture. In Soviet terms, that term refers fairly</page><page sequence="3">Review Article 121 narrowly to burial structures, ritual, materials found in those burials, and - where relevant - to settlement sites. Beyond very general statements, there is little attempt to relate found materials to interconnections with other, settled, cultures, such as the Greeks, Persians, or Chinese. Other than in Melyukova's more historically oriented essay, the authors do not go beyond fairly dry discussions of archaeological finds in what they judge to be the most important sites. Yablonsky adds important information relating to 'ethnogenesis,' derived from physical anthropology and paleoecology; unfortunately, some of that information is most difficult to use, based as it is on graphs of craniometric studies which appear to have been lifted from a much more specialized paper and inserted here with inadequate comment. Frequently, indeed, one senses that the essays have been cobbled together from a variety of highly specialized discussions originally published in Russian, pasted together and introduced with very general comments. This volume follows what has become a traditional way of laying out the combined cultures of the Early Nomads of the early Iron Age, i.e. from west to east. This particular order of discussion actually runs counter to the historical spread of the Early Nomads from east to west, but it does reflect a number of factors which shape the way the West has thought about the Eurasian Steppe. The Scythian culture of the Black Sea region was known earliest of all. With the finds of splendid gold objects recovered in the 19th century housed in the Hermitage Museum and published in volumes available in the West, Scythian culture came to be understood as a fundamental expression of the larger Early Nomadic world. For many years, as Melyukova's essay indicates, there has been an attempt to link the Scythian culture more closely with that of the ancient Near Eastern Iranian world rather than with that of Inner Asia. Some of the earlier, if not earliest, finds indicative of the</page><page sequence="4">1 22 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) Early Nomadic world have been associated with the Scythians of the Caucasus and Black Sea. Finally, one cannot ignore the significance of modern geopolitical considerations on the shaping of cultural studies: for over a century there has prevailed the unspoken principle that dominant cultures in the prehistoric Eurasian Steppe had to have come out of eastern Europe (read: the heartland of Russia) moving eastwards and submerging local cultures along the way. This predisposition has made it almost impossible to consider cultural penetration coming out from Mongolia at a date earlier than the undeniable Xiongnu. The result is that while most scholars would now agree that the Scythians came out of Inner Asia in the early first millennium B.C.E., they are not inclined to seek deeply into the question: 'but from where, when, and why?' As Yablonsky's materials indicate, it is possible to follow the Scythian trail back in time and eastward in space, to northern Central Asia, i.e. modern Kazakstan, and beyond. One would never know it from this book, however, without a close reading for some critical information. Yablonsky refers on several occasions to a 'Mongolian admixture' expressed in craniological data from burials of the Syr Darya Saka in the mid-first millennium B.C.E. This admixture appears also among the Amu Darya Saka from a somewhat earlier period, and he notes in conclusion that such an admixture is not atypical among late Bronze Age populations from "areas of Southern (sic) Siberia and the Altai Mountains..." (p. 230). Such notes are intriguing when combined with the occasional mention of 'Mongoloid' elements in burials from the Altai region of South Siberia.2 Albeit suffering from many of the editorial problems characteristic of the volume as a whole, Yablonsky's essay on the Sakas of Central Asia is unquestionably the best section in the book. It effectively integrates the most important sites and archaeological materials from the Saka world with</page><page sequence="5">Review Article 123 historical information and information derived from paleoanthropology . His discussions (pp. 214, 222. 229-230, 238, 248) of the non-homogeneous nature of early Saka populations are of particular interest to prehistorians of Mongolia, indicating as they do the admixture of a Mongolian type, particularly among females, as far west as the Aral Sea. Yablonsky's conclusions regarding the anthropological character of the Sakas foreground the necessity of re-evaluating traditional assumptions regarding the origins of the Early Nomads: It is presumed that indigenous Bronze Age Central Asian populations directly contributed to the genesis of the Saka in each particular area. If this is true, the dolichocephalic maturized Europoids from the lower Amu Darya River necropoleis should be considered as representative of the 'pre- Saka' anthropological layer that had been subjected in the 7th century B.C. to a cultural and partially biological assimilation by populations coming from the east (p. 248). Unfortunately, the other two sections most closely related to Mongolia - that by Bokovenko on the Scythians (s/c) in Siberia and that by Volkov on Mongolia - are quite disappointing. Bokovenko follows what might be called the traditional Soviet line in his over-reliance on so-called 'princely' burials and gives strikingly little attention to the rich commoners' burials found excavated in the last two decades in the Chuya Steppe and on the Ukok Plateau, both on the border of Mongolia.3 The traditional (Soviet/Russian) understanding of the Early Nomadic culture of South Siberia as an exemplary 'warrior-democracy,' and his uncritical acceptance of the received 'mythologema' (p. 272) underlying the great Early Nomadic burials of South Siberia have also shaped his consideration. These assumptions undermine even his discussion of the large burials. In speaking of Arzhan - a major wheel-shaped necropolis in Tuva, north of Kyzyl - Bokovenko fails to point out that the bodies in the central chamber had all been pulled out of their coffins, and that the articles of</page><page sequence="6">1 24 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) 4 luxe' found in the huge burial had been completely disengaged from their original locations. Such disruption makes it unwise to conclude that Arzhan was the burial of a "supreme ruler - a military leader-priest" (ibid.) Bokovenko may be correct in observing that the style of the 24 sets of horse bridles found at Arzhan could indicate that they "come from different time periods" (p. 270), but such an observation would seem to demand explanation. With reference to the important bronze plaque of a coiled feline, believed to have been mounted on the breast of one of the horses buried at Arzhan, Bokovenko' s statement that a "similar but more archaic-styled plaque was a chance find in Mongolia" (p. 271) is frustratingly imprecise. Any student of the Early Nomadic culture knows that this image type is extremely important in tracing the movement of the Early Nomads across Central Asia and into the Black Sea region; to omit further discussion (found where? material? size? publication?) of the 'more archaic' plaque from Mongolia is - to this reader, at least - to miss the point. The same reaction pertains to his casual observation, without further comment, that the finds in the burial chambers on the south side of the Arzhan necropolis "came from Tuva and Mongolia" (p. 273). In this writer's opinion, it is high time scholars reconsidered the nature of Arzhan, not as a burial dedicated to a single great chief, but rather as a necropolis of a lineage, used and reused over a long period of time. Bokovenko's discussion of the so-called Scythians in Siberia includes Tuva, the Altai Mountains, and the Minusinsk Basin. The perpetual reference to Scythians is regrettable; the application of that and related terminology to the whole Early Nomadic world should have been discarded long ago, applying as it does only to early nomadic groups in the Iranian Plateau, the Caucasus, and around the northern region of the Black Sea. Applying Herodotus' s report on the</page><page sequence="7">Review Article 125 Massagetae to the Early Nomads of Tuva is not substantiated and does not support Bokovenko's analysis of social groups in the period of Arzhan (p. 281). In light of Yablonsky's discussion of paleoanthropology in Central Asia, Bokovenko's final statement in Chapter 17 - that the "Europoid population" prevalent in Tuva in the Arzhan period was "gradually replaced by Mongoloid ethnic types. . . who arrived there by the end of the 1st millennium B.C. from the interior regions of Central Asia" (p. 281) - requires clarification. Errors of fact are too frequent in the section on South Siberia; they preclude the confident assigning of this material, even to graduate students, as a source of basic information. This refers not only to the misleading discussion of Arzhan, the omission of significant references, the puzzling statement, of collective burials in Tuva, "(h)orsemen were buried without their horses" (p. 273), or the mistaken indication of arrow size in the case of an important burial group in Tuva (p. 277). 4 Our bewildered graduate student might also ask how it happens that Siberian stags have fangs (p. 279); and what is a 'kabarga' (ibid.)? On the map of the Altai Mountains (Map 17), the important Chuya River becomes the Chu, the UrsuF is transformed into the Ursup, but at least the spelling for Yustyd is an improvement over its appearance in Fig. 11, where the site is referred to as the Ystydskii complex. Bokovenko's preoccupation with male chieftains allows him to contradict significant evidence from the Pazyryk burials, concluding that the seated figure in the great felt hanging from Pazyryk 5 is a 'priest' (p. 291 )5 and completely ignoring the extensive indicators of wealthy female burials, including that of Pazyryk 5. His discussion of metal-casting technologies-a key part of Early Nomadic material culture-is confusing, including vague references to lost wax casting (p. 292) and gold-working techniques which actually apply only to the unprovenanced materials of the Siberian</page><page sequence="8">1 26 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) Treasure of Peter the Great (ibid ). His discussion of the parallelism of animal imagery from the Pazyryk Culture and tribal signs lacks any substantiation and could not be supported by a careful study of the culture's own material remains. Similar problems plague Chapter 19, on the Tagar Culture in the Minusinsk Basin, and need not detain us here. One might simply warn the reader that the wholesale use, without due comment, of unprovenanced materials renders all conclusions suspect and certainly undermines the authorial comment that, in general, art from the Tagar Culture provides "convincing evidence that most often the content and mode of their execution was [sic] superior to those artistic traits and complex semantic contents found in the arts of neighboring areas" (p. 309). No more confidence can be mustered by the further conclusion, as if from the air, that the "Arzhan materials point to the consolidation and cultural unity of the Sayan-Altai tribes and the partial consolidation with the Kazakhstani and Mongolian tribes during the 8th century B.C. period" (p. 310). Unfortunately, the weakest section of this volume is by far that contributed by the scholar Vitali V. Volkov on the Early Nomads of Mongolia. Volkov did once enjoy a significant reputation as an archaeologist in Mongolia, during the period when Soviet archaeologists were doing extensive and often important work in that region. The underlying tone of this section, however, reveals the unwritten principle of that period when the Soviet Union dominated Mongolian interests, viz. "Mongolians dig, Russians publish." Volkov's most important publication is certainly Olennie kamni Mongola ("Deer Stones of Mongolia") (Ulan-Bator, 1981). In that volume he catalogued several hundred deer stones and included drawings of many individual stones and the complexes in which they had been found. But it is now many years since Volkov and his Russian colleagues have been</page><page sequence="9">Review Article 127 allowed to work in Mongolia; this chapter reflects a by-gone age, as it were, and an unbalanced consideration of the archaeology of ancient Mongolia. Volkov dates the appearance of pastoralism in Mongolia to the late Neolithic and early Eneolithic periods (p. 320), the result of the intrusion of Afanasiev cultural elements into Mongolia from the north and northwest.6 He supports his argument by reference to a series of low mounds at the sites of Altan Sandal and Shatar Chuluu in the Khangai (Hangai) Range. These burials and a number of others were excavated in 1971 by a team representing the Mongolian- Soviet Historico-Cultural Expedition (MSIK), including Volkov. The form of the surface mounds of three of the burials could support attribution to the Afanasiev Culture.7 Yet excavation of one mound revealed neither a full human burial nor any ceramics of the Afanasiev type; however, there were found fragments of human leg bones and a broken iron nut of a cart from the Turkic Period (9th- 10th c.).8 In 1975, the same team excavated about ten round mounds in the area of Altan sandal in Arkhangai aimag's Ikh Tamir district. These mounds were analogous to those earlier excavated at Shatar Chuluu and should have revealed Afanasiev burials. Not one of these mounds revealed either a burial or ceramics of the Afanasiev type. Thus it is difficult to have faith in his report of Afanasiev burials on Mongolian territory, or in his conclusion that cattle breeding came into Mongolia with the western Siberian Afanasiev culture. Further in his chapter Volkov writes of the Slab Grave culture and dates it to the 7th-3rd c. B.C.E., while indicating that some of the burials may be earlier (p. 321). Excavations of the last twenty years actually indicate that a large number of these slab graves may be much earlier, that is of the Bronze Age. In connection with the well-known find of a pair of gold fibulae with</page><page sequence="10">1 28 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) argali-shaped heads in a slab grave at Tevsh uul in Övörkhangai aimag's Bogd district, a number of authors have proposed that not only this burial but also similar ones should be dated to the Bronze Age and more specifically to the Karasuk period.9 In recent years, in the Onon, Er, and Kherlen river basins, Mongolian, French, and Korean archaeologists have excavated a number of slab graves with such finds as stone tools and stone vessels for smelting copper; bronze arrow heads, helmets, plaques, ornamental objects, and ceramic vessels, among other objects. These finds may be dated to the 12th- 10th c. B.C.E. V. Volkov writes, further, that the western edge of the slab grave type is found in the Great Lakes basin of Mongolia (p. 321). In fact, the slab grave form appears to have been used over a much larger area than Volkov notes. In 1986, Mongolian archaeologists excavated several cemeteries in western Mongolia, in the territory of Khovd aimag's Bulgan district, and in 1995, the Joint Mongolian-American-Russian Altay Project identified slab grave burials in the Sogoo river valley, in Bayan-Ölgii aimag's Ulaankhus district. This type of burial is also known in Xinjiang and in northern Tibet. Elsewhere in his overview, Volkov writes of the "Ulangom" cemetery (p. 324) or culture (p. 325) of the early Iron Age of northwestern Mongolia, a site investigated by Mongolian and Soviet archaeologists including Volkov and E. A. Novgorodova. The "Ulangom" cemetery is found along the northern slopes of the Chandmanï Range and just south of the city of Ulaangom, in Uvs aimag. Yet from the very beginning of investigations there the field archaeologists called this cemetery 'Chandmanï,' after the mountain range; this appellation has been reaffirmed in field notes, field reports, and in numerous monographs, dissertations, and articles written since in Mongolian and</page><page sequence="11">Review Article 129 Russian.10 The term, 'Chandmanï,' was even adopted in the fundamental study, History of the Mongolian Peoples' Republic (Ulaanbaatar, 1982). The results of three seasons of disciplined excavations of more than 40 burials from the Chandmanï Range by the joint Mongolian-Russian team have been published by the Soviet archaeologists in a separate publication in Germany under the title, Ulangom. Ein skythenzeitliches Gräberfeld in der Mongolei (Wiesbaden, 1 982) after the name of the near-by city. In that publication, there is no reference to the publications of Mongolian investigators, and no credit is given to the Mongolian archaeologists and anthropologists who worked together with the Soviet archaeologists on this site. For the Mongolian archaeologists working there, the term "Ulangom cemetery" or culture has no scientific basis.11 Volkov devotes considerable attention to the (so-called) deer stones, an early form of monumental sculpture. Deer stones are remarkable monuments from the culture and history of the nomads of Mongolia and Central Asia and have justifiably attracted the attention of many scholars.12 The typology of these stones still requires re-consideration, but using the traditional definition of the monument type, it has been estimated that there are about 650 deer stones now known, including about 550 in Mongolia, about 80 in the Transbaikal, Tuva, and the Altai Republic, and the remaining number scattered across Kazakhstan, the Caucasus, and eastern Europe to the valley of the Elba River.13 In his discussion of deer stones, Volkov dates them to the early Iron Age (p. 330). However, many deer stones of the Mongolian type display representations of large daggers with hilt ends ornamented with the heads of mountain goats, deer, argali, or with a variety of forms characteristic of the Karasuk period, that is of the Bronze Age. In his discussion of deer stones, Volkov offers several illustrations of the type, but without clear references except to general regions:</page><page sequence="12">1 3 0 Mongolian Studies XX (1997) 'Eurasian,' 'Mongol-Transbaikalian,' 4 Sayan- Altai.' Even specific find-sites of the objects from Mongolia, published more than once by several authors, are not indicated. One senses here, again, a tendency to diminish the place of specific objects and monument types within the history and culture of Mongolia and to reorient them into a more general culture of Siberia, Altai, Tuva, and other regions, all of which became subordinated to the culture of Russia. This tendency is well demonstrated by the manner in which Volkov refers to 40 sites in Tuva with deer stones, to more than 50 Altai deer stones, and to a variety of other 'deer stones' across the Eurasian steppe, but without ever referring specifically to the far greater number (approximately 550) of Mongolian deer stones. Ignored in this discussion, also, is the fact that the Mongolian stone type is far larger and more impressive in carving than anything found beyond the borders of present-day Mongolia and the Transbaikal. It is probably, also, the oldest of the large deer stone types. With the exception of one reference to a 1971 publication by D. Dorj, Volkov makes no reference in this chapter to the work of any Mongolian archaeologists. Moreover, his chapter is completely lacking any reference to petroglyphs, one of the most significant kinds of Bronze and early Iron Age monuments in Mongolia. Over 200 petroglyphic sites have been reported in Mongolia, many for the first time in the last 20 years. A significant number of studies of petroglyphs have been published in Russian and Mongolian, and more recently in English.14 Lacking here, also, are any references to the research and material collections related to the early history of nomadism gathered in the last 20 years by Mongolian researchers working with Russian, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, French, and American colleagues; nor are there any references to the many publications in a variety of languages other than Russian.15</page><page sequence="13">Review Article 131 In brief, the chapter written by V. Volkov may give a limited understanding of the ancient nomadic cultures of Mongolia according to the knowledge accumulated by archaeological research up to the middle 1970's; but readers should be aware that the material he offers is organized around his central conception: that the most significant cultures came into Mongolia from the north, that is from what is now Russian territory; that since the Soviet period there has been no significant archaeological research in that vast region; and that Mongolian scholars have had little to add to the prehistory of their country .16 One would have hoped that this volume would fill a major need in Western scholarship, but by virtue of numerous errors of fact and points of carelessness, and by virtue of the unevenness of the sections, it fails to do so adequately. One can quibble about small errors, even forgive them when the larger conception is significant and well argued; but in this volume there are lapses which should not occur in scholarly books. Illustrative materials in this volume provide a case in point. Neither within the text captions nor within the List of Figures is there a consistent indication of the provenance of artifacts or burials. Thus, sometimes objects are simply identified as to type (e.g., Chapter 14, "Figure 21: Whetstones and other tools, possibly awls"), sometimes they are given a general provenance (Chapter 14, "Fig. 29: Burials, Irtysh Valley"), sometimes they are referred to by culture (Chapter 17, "Figure 21: Awls, Uyuk Culture"); rarely - and almost only in the case of burials - are the figures associated with a specific site. The problem of non-identification of provenance is particularly apparent in the sections on Siberia and Mongolia. Such a lapse of critical information makes the illustrative materials virtually useless for scholarly purposes. Furthermore,</page><page sequence="14">132 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) many of these illustrations were taken from other sources which remain uncredited. For the authors of this review, this use of uncredited material seems particularly apparent in the case of the chapters on South Siberia and Mongolia. No less problematic are the maps, which should form the backbone of this volume. The Early Nomads of the Eurasian Steppe actually inhabited a much more complex geophysical world than is encompassed by the term 'steppe.' Their requirement for renewable pastures necessitated that they move not so much horizontally as vertically. Thus the true nature of the Early Nomadic world involved steppe and mountain-steppe, steppe and forest, steppe and riparian zones. Any indication of this fundamental ecological complexity is virtually lacking in all the maps included in this volume. "Map 1. Eurasian Steppes in the Scytho-Sarmatian Period" shows some rivers, lakes, and seas, but the seas are labeled on land. There is no apparent reason for the variation in type face, which would ordinarily identify entities of comparable scale. Here, however, the 'Tasmola Culture' is larger than the 'Tagar' or 'Uyuk' cultures. For some strange reason, the label, 'Sarmatians (IV c. B.C. -IV c. A.D.)' is considerably larger and darker than the earlier 'Scythians' or the later 'Scythian Kingdom.' There are no indications on this map of the mountainous zones which were as fundamental to the emergence of nomadism as were the steppes themselves. Strangely, also, none of the major Mongolian rivers are labeled. Another general map, "Map 10. Climatic Variations in the Eurasian Steppes" is virtually impossible to read. The black lines which squirm over its surface apparently indicate climatological zones, but the lines are difficult to follow, they have no indicated relationship to mountainous areas, and - most serious - we cannot know from the map the period(s) to which these zones refer.17 Closer to Mongolia, maps get a bit more detailed, but with added complications.</page><page sequence="15">Review Article 133 For example, Map 18 purports to indicate the locations of Tagar culture monuments in the Yenisei drainage - 103 of them, to be exact. However, the reference to monument locations in the text may be given one way (e.g., p. 301: "Bolshoi Salbykskii Kurgan") and in the map by another (i.e., "Salbyk"). Since neither here nor on most of the maps is the key alphabetized, one has to look long and hard to finally find the corresponding site. The map for the section on Mongolia is completely inappropriate, showing instead a map of sites where deer stones may be found across the Eurasian Steppe. In this case, 'Mongolia' gets the same typeface as the mountain range, 'Altai,' and smaller and lighter typeface than that used for 'India' or 'China.' The issue here is not, of course, what is more important; rather, professional maps should use like type face to indicate like entities, unless otherwise indicated. The smaller problems in this book are legion. They include inconsistent and sometimes downright peculiar transliterations, inconsistencies in dates of sources between the text reference and the reference in the Bibliography, inconsistent forms of reference (i.e., either nominal or adjectival) between the text, the figures, and the maps. Some of these errors are of little importance, but others significantly hamper the confident use of the volume as a scholarly source. Many of these problems could have been at least conceptually alleviated had the Foreword included some reflection on the relative strengths and inadequacies of Soviet period archaeology. One cannot deny that the archaeology of that period produced many spectacular finds and much knowledge. At the same time, it is impossible to ignore the fact that methodologies were often rather primitive, theories were stilted by scholarly isolation, and professional territories jealously guarded against any apparent interlopers.18 By placing Soviet scholarship within its own historical</page><page sequence="16">134 Mongolian Studies XX ( 1 997) context - when Western methodologies and theories were suspect and inaccessible - one might begin to 'forgive' the isolationist aspect of much of the theorizing and writing. But there is no such context offered: reading the volume one begins to wonder if any of the scholars involved have yet discovered that scholarly exchange with Western scholars might be useful. . . or even that Western archaeology and cultural studies exist. E. Jacobson and D. Tseveendorj NOTES 1. Another common term for these people is Scytho-Siberians. Professional accountability necessitates our pointing out that the observations included in the section on Volkov's discussion of Mongolian archaeology were contributed by D. Tseveendorj; otherwise, E. Jacobson is responsible for this review. 2. See, e.g., Rudenko's discussion of the tattooed man in Pazyryk 2, in S. I. Rudenko, Frozen Tombs of Siberia, translated by M. W. Thompson (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1970). More recent, but not so recent that they could not have been included in an editorial note in this volume, are preliminary DNA studies indicating that the spectacular burials excavated on the Ukok Plateau may reflect a population with a significant 'Mongolian' admixture. Since the bodies from which these DNA samples were taken are tattooed with 'typical' Pazyryk culture motifs and since the burials were also typically 'Pazyryk,' we are confronted with the possibility that the origins of the Early Nomads, and of their distinctive artistic traditions, may be more closely associated with the region of present-day Mongolia than with that of South Siberia or Kazakhstan. Recent studies by these authors, and colleagues, of petroglyphic sites in the Altai Republic near the border of Mongolia, and in the Mongolian Altai, have forced us to seriously consider the possibility that the primary source of Early Nomadic culture may actually have been in the eastern slopes of the Altai Mountains; groups moved north, northwest, and west from this region in the early first millennium B.C.E. This material is now beginning to be published. 3. V.D.

As a result of archaeological and ethnographic research in recent years, Mongolian archaeologists have argued that animal husbandry in Mongolia may have appeared much earlier and perhaps as early as the Mesolithic period (15,000 - 7,000 B.P.). 7.

Regarding the two earlier excavated burials, Volkov published a short article in 1980, but without any illustrations and in which there is no reference to a human skeleton, to egg-shaped ceramic vessels, or other material finds (V.V. Volkov, Studia arkheologii , vol. 9, no. 2 [Ulaanbaatar, 1980]). In fact, there were no other finds. One must also say that vessels with egg-shaped bases were widely spread throughout Eurasia in the Neolithic and Eneolithic periods, all the way from Japan to Spain. Thus it is not possible to say that this type of vessel indicates a specific culture. 9. See D. Tseveendorj, Mongolyn khui negdliin urlagiin dursgal, Ulaanbaatar, 1983; E.A.

See E.A. Novgorodova, V.V. Volkov, , S.N. Korenevskij, and N.N. Mamonova, Ulangom. Ein skythenzeitliches Gräberfeld in der Mongolei (Wiesbaden, 1982). 12. These include A. P. Okladnikov, N.L. Chlenova, V.V. Volkov, V.D. Kubarev, G.D. Savinov, D. Tseveendoij, and, in English, E. Jacobson. In G.D. Savinov's recent study, Olennie kameny (St. Petersburg, 1994), are included a comprehensive discussion of materials on the study of deer stones. 13. It is debatable to conclude, along with Volkov and most scholars, that all standing stones of anthropomorphic appearance should be called 'deer-stones.' In fact, true 'deer stones' are probably found only in the Transbaikal and Mongolia and are distinguished by being enwrapped by carvings of large, stylized deer. With the exclusion of a few stones from areas close to the border of Mongolia, stones from Tuva and the Altay Republic may have only one deer, at most. Further west, the deer motif is usually absent. 14. See, e.g., works by Ts. Doijsüren, Perlee, Dorj, and Novgorodova. Most curious is Volkov's omission of the important volumes by A.P. Okladnikov on Mongolian petroglyphs (1954, 1980, 1981, 1981). 15. In more recent years these include, for example, the annual publications of Studia archaeologica, of the Institute of History, MAS; the 2 volume report of the Join Mongol-Japanese project, Gurvan gol; the 5 vol. publication of the joint Mongol-Korean project, 'Eastern Mongolia'; the report of the Joint Russian-Mongolian-American Project working on paleolithic sites in the Gobi (1995), and the field reports and preliminary publications of the Mongolian- American-Russian Altay Project. These reports have all been filed and are available in the archives of the Institute of History, MAS. 16. Readers should also beware of repeated errors of a typological or conceptual nature; e.g., the reference to 'fighting chariots' on the basis of deer stone imagery or concepts such as the 'Scytho-Saka-Siberian unity,' as well as transcription errors such as 'M. Ler' for M. Loehr (p. 33 1), and so forth. 17. Rock carvings of South Siberia and Mongolia indicate a radical change in the paleoecology of the Bronze Age, with significant impact on human culture.</page><page sequence="18">1 3 6 Mongolian Studies XX (1997) 18. This territorial instinct applies as well to certain Soviet and post-Soviet scholarship as it does to Western and Mongolian scholarship. It is most surprising, for example, to find no reference in this volume to the major contributions of A.Iu. Alekseyev, to A.D. Martynov's study of Tagar culture (1979), or to a number of the publications by Kubarev, Molodin, and Polas'mak, mentioned above.</page></plain_text>
