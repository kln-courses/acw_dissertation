ABSTRACT This study examines the added safety improvement effects of the Integrated (Belted) Structural Seat (ISS™) combined with an inflatable shoulder belt that inflates to form a cylindrical airbag during an automobile frontal crash. Although inflatable shoulder belts have been stud- ied for many years with proven results, occupant impact response data and sled testing has been very limited to date when combining these two relatively new types of automotive safety systems. Accident studies show that frontal collisions, are by far the crashes with the most serious consequences. In fron- tal collisions, the main lesions placed upon the occupants are thoracic, mainly high chest deceleration, head inju- ries which result from the high deceleration levels due to occupant's contact with the vehicle interiors, and rib frac- tures resulting from the high seat belt contact forces. In order to improve this situation, it becomes important to ensure that the means used to restrain the automotive occupant(s) work as efficiently as possible early in the crash event to reduce the motion of the torso and head. With this perspective, it becomes important to have an occupant restraint system which has the overall injury mitigating benefits of the conventional restraint systems, but at the same time eliminates certain other potential injury mechanisms. The seat integrated inflatable shoul- der belt is one such self contained restraint system which has improved occupant protection capabilities. HyGe™ sled tests were conducted to evaluate the injury mitigating benefits of the seat integrated inflatable shoul- der belt restraint system. Sled tests were conducted for the three different sized Hybrid III dummies and using a 35 mph crash pulse. Detailed results of the sled tests are presented later in this paper, and the results are also compared with the published NCAP results for a mid-size production vehicle that has a similar vehicle crash pulse and a conventional 3-point seat belt and airbag system. INTRODUCTION Occupant protection in vehicular environments during a crash relies on decelerating the occupant over the long- est time possible while preventing striking to any interior objects. Significant improvements in occupant protection can be provided by an inflatable shoulder belt which inflates very early in the crash event. It inflates in approx- imately 10 milliseconds after the crash sensor signal and simultaneously tightens (pretensions) the belt. Inflation reduces the belt length by approximately 12 % and applies a pre-load of about 2 kN on the occupant's upper torso. This causes belt slack to be eliminated so that it ini- tiates occupant deceleration with the smallest possible delay. This type of restraint system also has the advan- tage that it inflates away from the occupant instead of deploying towards the occupant at high speeds. The seat integrated inflatable belt when inflated, provides a cushioned control area of approximately 0.16 m2. This causes distribution of the restraint load on the occupant and is thereby effective in reducing the well recognized occurrence of belt induced trauma. Moreover, the occu- pant's head and neck motion are significantly reduced as compared to conventional restraint systems. Historically, inflatable shoulder belts have shown immense promise as an effective automobile occupant restraint system. However, the problems associated with such a system back in the 1970s were those of stowage, bulkiness of the inflatable section, large and heavy gas generators, large and unreliable sensors, etc. Technolog- ical developments and improvements in the area of infla- tors, high tenacity lightweight fabric, etc., have addressed and solved many of the older concerns such as inflator output gas temperature, packaging, styling and comfort. Many agencies and companies have evaluated the inflat- able seat belt system in the past. Extensive research and development work has been carried out in the area of inflatable seat belt systems. Most of the prior published data are from crash tests that were carried out under 98</page><page sequence="2">conditions involving lower impact speeds and non- production intent hardware. The integrated inflatable belted seat sled data presented in this paper, uses NCAP level test conditions and production intent hardware. DYNAMIC SCIENCES, INC. - Dynamic Sciences Inc., prepared a report (Report No. 8300-77-146) for NHTSA (Contract DOT-HS-6-01307). The objective of this basic research program was to establish the occupant perfor- mance limits of four advanced restraint systems . One of these was a force-limited air belt. These restraint sys- tems were integrated into a production compact automo- bile which had shown acceptable crashworthiness performance. The Volvo 244 and the Ford Torino were the cars chosen. The crash test conditions were selected to determine the performance limits of the combined advanced restraints and production structural systems. The test configuration involved different crash modes including car to car Head-on, Oblique, Offset and 90° Barrier impacts. The closing speeds involved in the car- to-car tests exceeded 80 mph. The speeds involved in the barrier tests exceeded 45 mph. HIC values as low as 205 and Chest 3 ms Criteria values of 30 g were observed on some of these tests. It was concluded that the inflatable seat belt concept restraint provided adequate protection for frontal impact at speeds up to 48 mph and excellent protection for the 40-45 mph speed range. IMPACT TESTING OF ALLIED CHEMICAL "INFLATABAND" - A series of 69 dynamic sled tests were conducted in 1975 to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Inflataband" restraint system as a viable method of occupant protection in simulated head-on automotive crashes. Of these, 30 tests involved dummies and the other 39 involved human volunteers. Kinematic perfor- mance of anthropomorphic dummies and human volun- teers under simulated impact conditions was evaluated. The report was prepared for NHTSA (Contract No. DOT- HS-4-00933 October 1975). The deceleration pulse uti- lized for the 32.5 mph total velocity change tests, was a representative 30 mph barrier crash pulse for a 1972 Pinto with a peak deceleration of less than 20 g. In no case did the observed severity indicators (HIC, Chest Acceleration 3 ms clip) approach or exceed the existing human tolerance levels for these indicators. HIC values as low as 174 and Chest 3 ms Criteria values of 18 g were observed on some of these tests. Injuries to the human subjects were minimal consisting primarily of mild erythema to the face and neck. At the higher impact severities, some residual neck soreness which existed for a short period of time was documented. Impact forces on the upper torso and abdomen were effectively distributed without major discomfort. AIR BELT RESTRAINTS- A experimental test program was conducted in 1976. This program included six sled tests using five unembalmed cadavers and one anthropo- morphic test dummy to evaluate a standard three point belt system and an air belt which inflated during impact. Two of these cadaver tests were conducted to evaluate the airbelt restraint system. The other tests were for the standard three-point seat belt system. The report was submitted to NHTSA (Contract No. DOT-5-01017). The tests were conducted by simulating 30 mph frontal colli- sions for the three-point seat belts and 47 mph frontal collisions for the air belt systems. Cadaver instrumentation recorded levels of acceleration at the head below those accepted as fatal limits. The chest peak resultant acceleration measured was in the range of 48 g and 50 g. This coupled with a Chest Sever- ity Index (CSI) in the range of 510 and 600, must lead to the interpretation that these 47 mph crashes would have been painful but not life endangering since : Head and NeckAIS 0 ChestAIS 2/3 AbdominalAIS 0 MATERIALS AND METHODS Universal Propulsion Co., Inc. has since revisited and developed the Inflataband™ inflatable seat belt restraint system. This system utilizes production intent hardware. For the purposes of evaluating the occupant protection performance of the seat integrated inflatable shoulder belt system, a series of ten sled tests were conducted. Seat integrated belt restraint systems have gained inter- est and popularity because of their ability to provide good occupant protection, improved seat belt packaging and comfort. The integrated structural seat system is an automobile seat which has the belt retractor assemblies mounted onto the seat. The integrated structural seat enhances occupant protection in all of the basic crash modes. The belt positioning on the occupant is consistent and improved regardless of the seating position. The overall length of the seat belt webbing is reduced, leading to less webbing elongation and hence less occupant excursion. Additional safety features such as side airbags can be integrated to the seat to further enhance occupant protection. The seat selected for this study was a standard produc- tion JCI Integrated Structural Seat (ISS™) which has conventional seat belt restraint system on it. The seat structure was modified to replace the existing seat belt with the Inflataband™ system. The upper torso retractor assembly was relocated. A guide tube assembly was added in the seat back to house and route the inflatable shoulder belt system attached to the inflator. The appro- priate buckle and latch plate hardware was selected and mounted on the production seat. The rest of the seat structure was left unchanged. Figure 2 is a schematic of the dummy positioned on the inflatable belt integrated seat system. The belt and retractor assembly mounting locations are clearly depicted. Figure 1 shows a cut away 99</page><page sequence="3">section of the seat back frame of the production ISS™ modified to accommodate the inflatable seat belt system and guide tube assembly. The Inflataband™ is essentially a 6 to 7 inches diameter fabric tube when inflated. In the stowed configuration, it forms a seatbelt as shown in Figure 3. The inflatable sec- tion is enclosed by a fabric cover which tears open in a controlled manner during inflation. The assembly is attached at it's bottom end to a seatbelt buckle latch plate using a short length of conventional lap belt webbing. The lap belt section of the restraint system is similar to the conventional seat belt system. The upper end of the inflatable shoulder belt through which inflation occurs is connected to a Universal Propulsion Company's propri- etary Direct-Thermal™ Inflator (DTI). This inflator type produces the cool gas that is required for this restraint system as it deploys in close proximity to the occupant. Deployment tests have demonstrated a temperature increase of 10° C on the inflatable belt fabric surface. This restraint system can be adapted to either a vehicle integrated or a seat integrated environment. SLED SETUP - All tests were performed on HyGe™ sleds. In all the tests, the inflatable shoulder belt inte- grated seat was mounted on a rigid flat plate which in turn was mounted on the sled. Automobile interior envi- ronment structures like the steering wheel, instrument panel, knee bolster etc. were not used in any of these 1 0 tests. This condition basically represented and tested the performance of the seat integrated inflatable seat belt restraint system as a stand alone system. The accelerometers mounted on the sled recorded the sled acceleration. The dummies were fitted with tri-axial accelerometers in the head, chest and pelvis to record the acceleration response. Load cells mounted at the dummy upper neck recorded the upper neck shear and axial forces and neck bending moments. The chest pot on the dummy recorded the sternum deflection. A pres- sure transducer measured the internal pressure of the inflatable shoulder belt. A thermocouple mounted on the inflatable seat belt measured the surface temperature. Load cells were mounted on the upper torso loop and the lap belt loop webbing to record the restraint system loads. Output signal conditioning was achieved using the standard recommended SAE filters. Table 1 summarizes the various channels of data collected and the corre- sponding filters used. Five 13 mm wide angle lens high speed cameras were appropriately positioned to record the dummy kinematics and restraint system hardware performance during the crash event. These cameras captured the side, front and top views. All the sled tests were conducted using a typical 35 mph mid-sized vehicle NCAP crash pulse depicted in Figure 4. Tests 1 through 6 were conducted using the 50th percen- tile Male Hybrid III dummy. Sled tests 7 and 8 evaluated the restraint system for a 5th percentile Hybrid III dummy. Sled Tests 9 and 1 0 evaluated the restraint system for a 95th percentile Male Hybrid III dummy. RESULTS Results of the ten sled tests for the three different sized occupants restrained by the inflatable shoulder belt sys- tem are presented. The data is presented under three dif- ferent sections, one each for the three different size dummies. The data presented includes the plots of the resultant acceleration of the dummy head, chest and pel- vis; the dummy sternum deflection plot and the dummy upper neck force and bending moment plots. 50TH PERCENTILE DUMMIES - Figure 5 illustrates the kinematics of the 50th %ile Hybrid III male dummy during the crash event, as recorded by the driver side off-board high speed camera. Frame (a) illustrates the dummy positioned in the seat and restrained by the inflatable seat belt at time Tzero. Frame (b) shows the fully deployed inflatable shoulder belt at about 20 ms. Frames (c) through (f) shows the sequence of the dummy kinematics during the crash event. The dummy head resultant acceleration curves for Tests 1 through 6 are as shown in Figure 6. The rise in the head g between 1 0 and 20 ms is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt and it's interaction with the dummy's head. The head resultant peak acceleration vary between 45 g and 55 g. The corresponding HIC val- ues obtained from these curves are compared in Figure 7 and are well within the FMVSS 208 allowable limit of 1000. The pretensioning effect of the inflatable seat belt is clearly visible from the dummy chest resultant accelera- tion curves shown in Figure 8. The rise in chest g at about 10 ms indicates the deployment and subsequent tightening of the inflatable seat belt around the dummy's upper torso. This causes the dummy chest excursion to be minimal. The chest resultant acceleration curves closely follow the sled acceleration trace. This velocity coupling is the primary design intent of the inflatable seat belt. The 3 ms clip of the peak chest resultant accelera- tion is compared in Figure 9 and is well within the FMVSS 208 allowable limit of 60 g. The loading on the dummy chest by the inflatable seat belt has a direct bearing on the dummy chest deflection. The chest deflection traces as obtained from the dummy chest pot are indicated in Figure 10. Out of the six, two tests indicated faulty dummy chest pot instrumentation. The peak chest deflection values are well below the FMVSS 208 allowable limit of 76 mm. The dummy pelvis resultant acceleration plots are illus- trated in Figure 1 1 . Out of the six tests, one test indicated faulty dummy pelvic accelerometer. The peaks in the pel- vis resultant acceleration at about 50 ms is a clear indica- tion of the dummy's pelvis contacting the anti- submarining ramp of the seat structure. 100</page><page sequence="4">Table 1 . Sled Test Data Channels and Filters Channel Description Filter Class Sled Acceleration 60.0 Dummy Head Acceleration 1000.0 Dummy Chest Acceleration 1 80.0 Dummy Chest Deflection 180.0 Dummy Pelvic Acceleration 1000.0 Dummy Upper Neck Force 1000.0 Dummy Upper Neck Moment 600.0 Inflatable Seat Belt Pressure 1000.0 Inflatable Seat Belt Thermocouple 1 000.0 Inflatable Seat Belt Lebow 60.0 Lap Belt Lebow 60.0 The inflatable seat belt is in close proximity to the dummy's neck. Hence, it becomes necessary to closely monitor the dummy upper neck forces and bending moment. The dummy upper neck fore-aft shear force curves are depicted in Figure 12. The fore shear force reaches it's maximum value around the time when the dummy's head is beginning to rebound. The peak upper neck fore-aft shear force is well within the allowable max- imum of 31 00 N. The aft shear force is low and well within the allowable maximum of 3100 N. The upper neck peak fore-aft shear forces are compared with the allowable maximum in Figures 13 and 14. The dummy upper neck lateral shear force as indicated in Figure 15 shows some peaks early In the crash event. This is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt and subsequent lateral loading on the dummy upper neck. Later in the crash event, the force pattern reverses direction and reaches it's maximum value around the time when the dummy's head is beginning to rebound. The peak upper neck lateral shear force is compared in Figures 16 and 17 and is well within the allowable limit of 3100 N. The dummy upper neck axial force plots are depicted in Figure 18. The plot shows initial peaks between 10 and 20 ms. This is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt which causes the dummy to be pushed down into the seat. The inflatable seat belt supports the head and neck during the crash event which causes the neck axial loads to be low when compared to the allowable limits.. Figures 19 and 20 compare the neck axial load with the allowable limits of 3300 N in tension and 4000 N in compression. The dummy upper neck flexion-extension bending moment plots are illustrated in Figure 21. The peak val- ues of the flexion and extension bending moments are compared in Figures 22 and 23. It can be noted that the peak upper neck flexion and extension bending moments are well within the allowable limits of 190 N-m and 57 N- m respectively. 5TH PERCENTILE DUMMIES -The dummy head resultant curves for Tests 7 and 8 are as shown in Figure 24. The rise in resultant head acceleration g as a result of the interaction of the inflatable seat belt with the dummy's head is clearly visible between 10 and 20 ms in the crash event. In Test 8, due to faulty instrumentation, the Z chan- nel data of the dummy head acceleration was lost. The resultant acceleration has been calculated ignoring this component. The corresponding HIC values as obtained from these curves are compared in Figure 40. and are well within the allowable limit of 1 1 1 3. The exposed length of the inflatable section of the restraint system, outside the seat trim is the least for the 5th percentile dummy when compared to the 50th and the 95th percentile dummies. This results in higher oper- ating pressures inside the inflatable seat belt. As a result, higher pre-tensioning of the dummy occurs and this is obvious from the chest resultant acceleration curves depicted in Figure 25. The initial peak in the chest result- ant curves at about 1 0 to 20 ms due to the early restrain- ing effect of the inflatable seat belt causes the dummy excursion to be minimal. The 3 ms clip values as obtained from these chest resultant acceleration plots are compared in Figure 41 and are below the allowable limit of 73 g. The dummy pelvis resultant accelerations curves are as shown in Figure 26. This gives details about the dummy excursion. The 5th percentile dummy pelvis shows mini- mal interaction with the anti-submarining ramp of the seat structure. The absence of spikes in the pelvis resultant acceleration traces support this statement. On Test 8, the dummy had a faulty chest pot which recorded erroneous chest deflection values. The chest deflection trace for dummy in Test 7 is as shown in Figure 27. The peak chest deflection values exceeded the allow- able limit of 46 mm by a small percentage. As only one data point is available, further testing is required to raise the statistical confidence in the results. Also, the restraint 101</page><page sequence="5">system can be suitably modified, for example by provid- ing a vent in the inflatable section, to rectify this situation. The inflatable seat belt rides closest. to the neck on the 5th percentile dummy compared to the other sized dum- mies. It is thus essential to evaluate the loading pattern on the dummy upper neck by the inflatable seat belt. The upper neck fore-aft shear force plot is depicted in Figure 28. The aft shear force exerted on the dummy upper neck is very low and is compared in Figure 43 with the allow- able limit of 2068 N . The fore-aft shear force exerted on the dummy is compared in Figure 42 and Figure 43 and is well within the allowable limit of 2068 N. The lateral shear force on the dummy upper neck shows initial peaks due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt as shown in Figure 29. The peak upper neck lateral force values are compared in Figure 44 and Figure 45 and are well below the allowable limit of 2068 N. The dummy upper neck axial force plots are depicted in Figure 30. The plot shows initial peaks between 1 0 and 20 ms. This is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt which causes the dummy to be pushed down into the seat. The inflatable seat belt supports the head and neck during the crash event which causes the neck axial loads to be low when compared to the allowable limits.. Figures 46 and 47 compare the neck axial load with the allowable limits of 2201 N in tension and 2668 N in compression respectively. In test 7, the dummy upper neck extension bending moment exceeded the allowable limits by a small per- centage. This situation can be easily corrected by slight modifications to the restraint system like venting of the inflatable section during the crash event. The flexion- extension bending moment curves are as shown in Fig- ure 31. The peak values obtained from these curves are low and are compared in Figures 48 and 49 with the allowable limit of 104 N-m in flexion and 31 N-m in exten- sion respectively. 95TH PERCENTILE DUMMIES - The dummy head resultant acceleration curves for Tests 9 and 10 are shown in Figure 32. The rise in the head resultant accel- eration between 1 0 and 20 ms is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt and it's interaction with the dummy's head. The peak head resultant acceleration val- ues vary between 45 g and 55 g. The corresponding HIC values as obtained from these curves are compared in Figure 40 and are within the allowable limit of 957. The pretensioning effect of the inflatable seat belt is clearly visible from the dummy chest resultant accelera- tion curves in Figure 33. The rise in chest resultant accel- eration at about 15 ms indicates the deployment and subsequent tightening of the inflatable seat belt around the dummy's upper torso. This causes the dummy chest excursion to be minimal. The chest resultant acceleration reaches the maximum value at about 85 ms due to the loading of the restraint system by the heavier 95th per- centile dummy. The 3 ms clip of the peak chest resultant g's is compared in Figure 41 and is well within the allow- able limit of 54 g. The loading on the dummy chest by the inflatable seat belt has a direct bearing on the dummy chest deflection. The chest deflection traces as obtained from the dummy chest pot are indicated in Figure 35. Out of the two tests with the 95th percentile dummy, one had faulty dummy chest pot instrumentation. The peak chest deflection val- ues are well below the allowable limit of 55 mm. The dummy pelvis resultant acceleration plots are illus- trated in Figure 34. The peak values range between 47 g and 52 g. The interaction between the dummy pelvis and the anti-submarining ramp of the seat structure is the highest with the 95th percentile dummy. The dummy upper neck fore-aft shear force curves are depicted in Figure 36. The fore shear force reaches it's maximum value around the time when the dummy's head is beginning to rebound. The peak upper neck fore-aft shear force is compared in Figures 42 and 43 and is well within the allowable limit of 3807 N. The dummy upper neck lateral shear force as indicated in Figure 37 shows some peaks early in the crash event. This is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt and subsequent lateral loading on the dummy upper neck. The lateral shear force reaches it's maximum value around the time when the dummy's head is beginning to rebound. The peak upper neck lateral shear force is well within the allowable limit of 3807 N and is compared in Figures 44 and 45. The dummy upper neck axial force plots are depicted in Figure 38. The plot shows initial peaks between 1 0 and 20 ms. This is due to the deployment of the inflatable seat belt which causes the dummy to be pushed down into the seat. The inflatable seat belt supports the head and neck during the crash event which causes the neck axial loads to be low when compared to the allowable limits.. Figures 46 and 47 compare the neck axial load with the allowable limits of 4052 N in tension and 4912 N in compression respectively. The dummy upper neck flexion extension bending moment plots are as illustrated in Figure 39. The peak values of the flexion and extension bending moments are compared in Figures 48 and 49. It can be noted that the peak upper neck bending moments are well below the allowable limits of 258 N-m in flexion and 78 N-m in extension respectively. DISCUSSION From a detailed review of the sled test results, it can be noted that all the dummy injury values like the HIC; dummy chest resultant acceleration 3 ms criteria; dummy chest deflection; dummy upper neck fore-aft, lateral and axial force; and dummy upper neck flexion-extension 102</page><page sequence="6">bending moment, (except one neck extension moment for the 5th percentile dummy) for the three different sized occupants are well below the recommended maximums. This clearly indicates that the seat integrated inflatable shoulder belt is very effective as a automobile occupant restraint system. Table 2 summarizes the various injury criteria as obtained from the ten sled tests and compares them with the allowable limits. COMPARISON TO NCAP VALUES AND FMVSS LIMITS - Table 6 shows a direct comparison of the injury values from the sled tests with the 50th percentile dummy and those from the passenger dummy of the NCAP test for a mid-size production vehicle that has a conventional 3-point seat belt and airbag system, and a similar vehicle crash pulse. It can be observed that, except for three of the severity indicators from the inflatable seat belt sled tests, the rest are lower than the values recorded on the NCAP test. Although three of the severity indicators were higher than the NCAP test results, they were well below the injury assesment reference values as seen from Table 3. LIMITATIONS OF THE FINDINGS -The seat integrated inflatable seat belt system so far has been tested on a rigid plate sled, not in an actual vehicle environment. Although this represents a more stringent condition, the restraint system has to be tested in a vehicle to identify the enhancement of the occupant protection in that envi- ronment. Although the crash pulse chosen represents a fairly severe one, the restraint system has to be validated for other test conditions which may include more severe crash pulses. The seat and inflatable belt design parame- ters need to be optimized further, which, is hoped, would only increase the protection benefits further. PLANS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS - A MADYMO computer simulation model for a frontal impact will be jointly developed with TNO-MADYMO and will be vali- dated with sled tests of the inflatable belt integrated seat. The model will be used to assess the occupant protec- tion of the inflatable belt integrated seat for additional, including more severe, conditions and crash pulses. The inflatable belt integrated seat will be sled tested with child dummies, and with forward and rear facing infant seats. Protection performance will be evaluated for out of posi- tion occupants. Misuse and abuse due care tests will be completed. The inflatable belt integrated seat will be eval- uated for occupant protection in side impact. The belt tensioning and load limiting performance of the inflatable belt integrated seat will be compared with performance of non-inflatable belt system which has belt pre-tensioner and load limiting belt retractors. The crash protection per- formance of the seat integrated inflatable shoulder belt will be compared against the performance of the conven- tional 3-point seat belt system and a 3-point seat belt system with an airbag. Additional tests will be conducted to assess the performance in cases which involve inter- action of the inflatable belt with frontal driver and passen- ger airbags. The performance of the inflatable belt integrated seat without the frontal airbags needs to be assessed for application in markets that do not have a passive restraint regulation. Table 2.

Sled tests were conducted for the inflatable belt inte- grated seat system with 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile Hybrid III dummies to evaluate the frontal impact protec- tion capabilities of this type of restraint system. The sled tests showed acceptable occupant protection indices for the seat integrated inflatable seat belt restraint system in terms of low HIC, low Chest 3 ms Criteria, low chest deflection, low neck force and bending moment val- ues as compared to the published NCAP test results and the established Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV).
