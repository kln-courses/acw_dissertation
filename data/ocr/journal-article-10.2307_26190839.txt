<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A B S T R A C T S No Dummies: Deafness, Baseball, and American Culture This article begins by examining the historical and social factors that  led to 1901 being the “deafest” year in major league baseball history  with four deaf players. In particular, the author discusses the career  of William Ellsworth “Dummy” Hoy, a deaf man from Ohio who  became the most celebrated deaf player in history and explores the  reasons why he is not more celebrated in the mainstream culture. Shared Thinking Processes with Four Deaf Poets:  A window on “the Creative” in “Creative Sign Language” This article discusses a new way of thinking about analyzing sign-  language poetry. Rather than merely focusing on the product, the  method involves observing the process of its creation. Recent years  have witnessed increasing literary and linguistic analysis of sign-  language poetry, with commentaries on texts and performances be- ing set within and drawing on a range of disciplines and analytical  techniques. However, attention has so far been paid to the texts and  performances rather than to the process of their creation. While work- ing with four of the UK’s most prolific sign-language poets, exploring  and trying to understand more about British Sign Language (BSL)  poetry, we became increasingly interested in the creative processes  that occur and emerge in the composition itself. We decided to give  them a task related to creative anthropomorphism and asked them to  think “out loud” about the process as they created their compositions.  We took our lead from think-aloud protocols, which have been  used extensively in studies of cognitive processes and knowledge  acquisition to understand how we solve problems (van Someren,   Barnard, and Sandberg 1994; Tirkkonen-Condit and Jääskeläinen  2000; Stone 2009). We invited the poets to reflect upon and share  with each other how they tackle a particular challenging aspect that  339 Sign Language Studies Vol. 12 No. 2 Winter 2012 Journal Winter BM Pgs 334-346.indd   339 1/26/2012   11:00:46 AM </page> <page sequence="2"> 340 | Sign Language Studie s is often  incorporated in sign-language poems. This shared thinking  process enabled them to explore anthropomorphic concepts together  and jointly to create poetic examples, while also giving us insight into  the processes of task completion (rather than only its final product). ASL Discourse Strategies: Chaining and Connecting:  explaining across Audiences This study takes advantage of a novel methodology—the use of a  single culturally-meaningful text written in English and presented  to different audiences in ASL—to examine the ways in which Deaf  native signers utilize contextualization strategies in order to match  the perceived linguistic and informational needs of an audience. We  demonstrate, through close examination of the ASL text in compari- son with the English source text, that signers use contextualization  techniques (Gumper, 1982), which are discourse strategies that sup- port the construction of meaning. We suggest that two strategies for  supporting communication in ASL could be labeled contextualization  cues: chaining (Humphries and MacDougall 1999/2000) and what we  refer to as connecting-explaining. Both contextualization strategies ap- pear throughout all of the ASL texts, though connecting-explaining is  much more prevalent; it appears, on average, once  every ten seconds  with most audiences. This study of contextualization contributes to  our knowledge of ASL discourse strategies and has implications for  various professionals, including educators of Deaf children, signed- language linguists, signed-language interpreters, and interpreting  educators. Dictionaries of African Sign Languages: An overview This article gives an overview of dictionaries of African sign languages  that have been published to date most of which have not been widely  distributed. After an introduction into the field of sign language lexi- cography and a discussion of some of the obstacles that authors of sign  language dictionaries face in general, I will show problems related to  sign language dictionary making in Africa in particular. In the main  part of this article I show who produced these dictionaries, why and  for whom they were produced, how data was collected, and I compare  their content and their structures.

In particular, different phonetic nonmanual cues that may relate  to clause or sentence boundaries are discussed in detail. On the basis  of various ideas and views in the literature, we also describe two types  of studies that may further our understanding of prosodic domains  and their relation to sentence boundaries. The first type is a refine- ment of a recent series of perception studies in which signers’ intu- itions are elicited on break points in stretches of discourse. The second  type exploits new visual signal-processing techniques to detect salient  events in a video recording of signing. The article concludes with a  discussion of how knowledge of the prosody of signed languages can  be employed for language technology. Toward a Phonetic Representation of Hand Configuration:  The Thumb In this article, we present a system for the representation of the config- urations of the thumb in the hand configurations of signed  languages  and for the interactions of the thumb with the four fingers proper. The  configuration of the thumb is described as a componential combina- tion of the descriptions of thumb opposition, abduction of the CM  joint, and extension of the MCP and DIP joints. Interaction with the  other fingers is described as a relationship between specific surfaces of  the thumb and specific surfaces of the fingers involved.
