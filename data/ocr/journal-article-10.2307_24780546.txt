<plain_text><page sequence="1">Italo Calvino: The Code, The Clinamen and Cities PAUL A. HARRIS For Italo Calvino, even in an increasingly computerized culture, literature remains the form of technology best suited to express the potential, actual and hidden configurations of humans, machines and the physical universe. As he sees it, the art of writing is a technology in the sense that its materials and rules may be reduced to a logically complete grammar; but it is a vibrant, living mode of production because it bodies forth things hitherto unknown or unacknowledged. Even as he proposes that "literature...is merely the permu tation of a restricted number of elements and functions," Calvino asserts that it engages in a "struggle to escape from the confines of language; it stretches out from the utmost limits of what can be said; what stirs literature is the call and attraction of what is not in the dictionary" ("Ghosts" 18). Calvino's own literary struggle unfolded in a complicated nexus of cultural fields—from cybernetics, theoretical biology and Artificial Intelligence to chaos theory—and involved his recognition that the alphabet itself was just such a nexus; he was taken by Lucretius's use of the linguistic combinatoria as a model for "the impalpable atomic structure of matter" and Galileo's wonder at the fact that arrangements of letters communicate instantly across vast reaches of space and time (Memos 44-45). My purpose in the following essay is to examine the way that Calvino's combinatoric literary creations are organized around three categories: the code, or the self-modifying set of rules and conventions surrounding literature; the clinamen, the scientific trope for what disrupts the code and taps what would remain an otherwise invisible potential; the city, the concrete and cultural site of both.

Harris T Zero, a work which incorporates combinatorics and disruptions as an explicit theme, consists of a series of stories permeated by images and theo ries of science, from cosmology to evolution. As David Porush suggests, T Zero may even be read as a history of scientific paradigms and a synthesis of literary and scientific discourses (385-88). The narrator of the first group of stories is Qfwfq, a protean character who was witness to the Big Bang and evolves into human form in later stories. At the end of "Crystals"—a tale of Qfwfq's pursuit of love amid a world he finds too much comprised of imper fect glass when the possibility of crystalline perfection exists—Qfwfq's musings suddenly invert his previous search for the ideal order: As I look around I see nothing but perturbations of the order of the atoms: luminescent tubes, TV, the condensing of tiny silver crystals on the photo graphic plates....From the transistor comes the sound of a saxophone. The crystal which has succeeded in becoming the world, in making the world transparent to itself, in refracting it into infinite spectral images, is not mine: it is a corroded crystal, stained, mixed. The victory of the crystals (and of Vug) has been the same thing as their defeat (and mine). I'll wait now till the Thelonius Monk record ends, then I'll tell her. (38) Here Calvino thematically inscribes an instance of the breakdown of a code at the moment of its realization: just when the completion of the code is achieved, it turns out to be both more (a total "victory" of the crystals) and less (the corrosion and staining of them) than anticipated. This scenario could well serve as a depiction of certain trends that we have witnessed over the past thirty years across a variety of fields. Interpreting this little scene through the filter of the humanities, we could take Qfwfq's search for crystalline order as a version of the Structuralist attempt to derive a complete knowledge of the world from coherent codes; "A total crystal ... a topaz world which would leave out nothing," has been his dream. By contrast, his lovely partner Vug may be seen as assuming a Post-Structuralist position, quick as she is "to discover in crystals some differences, even minimal ones, irregularities, flaws" (33). The opposition Calvino sets up between Qfwfq and Vug is that between a rule-governed game where every move is prescribed and delimited by rigorous rules, and a so-called "free play" that operates flexibly within the bounds of some general constraints and conventions for playing, according to its own other rules. This polarity, however, is then de stabilized and rendered mobile and fluid: the concluding sentence of the story has that wonderfully uncanny effect of ungrounding these abstract consider ations and putting us back in an immediate reality: "I'll wait now till the Thelonious Monk record ends, then I'll tell her." In this way, Calvino reminds us that experience eludes every code, including language, and that the dynamic of gaming and playing will continually generate new games to play, including the language games of literature.</page><page sequence="3">Calvino and Codes 69 What complicates the game are the changes in rules and syntax that follow from the shifting fields of play in which it unfolds. As N. Katherine Hay les has recently observed, interdisciplinary writings—fictional or critical—face a difficult task: "how to talk about isomorphic concepts between disciplines and yet do full justice to the distinct tonalities and values that these concepts have when they are embedded in different sites. The double gesture of recognizing global structures and yet valorizing local sites is.. .both necessary and inevitable" (321). Measured by these criteria, Calvino's writings prove exemplary because even as they place literature in a nexus of diverse discursive fields, they distinguish literature's unique epistemological function and value, without creating an antagonistic relation between literature and science or technology. As such, Calvino's writing may be seen as a pragmatic response to a query posed by his friend Roland Barthes some three decades ago. "What is Litera ture?" Barthes had asked in 1972; "this interrogation is conducted not from outside but from within literature itself, or more exactly at its extreme verge, in that asymptotic zone where literature appears to destroy itself as a language object without destroying itself as a metalanguage, and where the metalanguage's quest is defined at the last possible moment as a new language object" (Essays 98). The trajectories of Calvino's writing in this zone are twofold: on the one hand, he expands the parameters and complexities of the structural and thematic aspects of literature, incorporating models and theories from different cultural domains into a literary metalanguage; on the other, he retains a sense of the inevitable transgressions that are committed when different domains are translated into one another, and thus he halts at the point where a new language project emerges. This self-consciousness expresses itself in Calvino's texts as a playful spontaneity which upsets the plan set in motion, or as a skepticism regarding the limits of representation—a recognition of the irreducible ontological difference between the textual and the "real" (whether we mean a physical process such as the workings of DNA, or a cultural reality such as the city). A further danger attendant on literature which borrows its form or themes from science and technology is that it becomes encumbered with or overdetermined by its sources. While some readers would accuse Calvino of remaining overly excogitative in his literary musings, however, his essays and fiction alike effuse what Barthes termed "the ubiquity of pleasure" to be found in writing—including writing that incorporates the level of metalanguage. Desire and language give forth "the pleasure of the text": for Barthes, this entails a "Notion of a book (of a text) in which is braided, woven, in the most personal way, the relation of every kind of bliss" (Text 59). For Calvino, the pleasure of writing embraces specific codes and desire in language, itself the most ubiquitous, multivalent and multi-leveled code. The code and desire are the components in a dynamic creative process structurally homologous to stochastic physical processes such as evolution; but because that process may be at once performed (as object language) and reflected upon (as metalanguage) in literature, the text maintains an ontological duplicity which marks its difference from the outcomes of such physical processes.</page><page sequence="4">70 Paul A. Harris One important facet of the cultural matrix surrounding Calvino's writing involves the change in the meaning attached to the word "code": from a synactic set of rules or a specific body of laws arranged so as to avoid inconsistency and overlapping, the code has taken on a life of its own, as it were. Codes are perceived as dynamic entities, whether we refer to the genetic code, language, or computer codes. In direct opposition to its former meaning, the current notion of code emphasizes precisely the logical inconsistencies and operative overlappings which are seen to generate the autonomy or self modification in its workings. We can clarify this different understanding of code by recourse to am .er key word in our vocabulary. Simulation somehow bespeaks a contemt ./rary atmosphere, and has become loaded with a distinct aura of computer cyberspace or "hyperreality": whereas simulation originally referred to mimicry or feigned imitation of something (as in animals which physically change to camouflage themselves), today it stands for the loss of the referent, for the collapsing of the distinction between reproduction and original, between map and territory. Simulation is both a thing and an activity, an object and a process, and taking the two simultaneously, we get a paradoxically self-referential process that generates itself. In more concrete and technical terms, it is the implementation of codes which makes a simulation possible—for instance, a computer simu lation of a rocket's trajectory or the development and changes of a dynamic physical system, such as cloud formation. The functional term for the way in which simulation is both object and process—for its "operative overlapping"— is recursion, the looping back on itself of a code's workings that uses the code's output as subsequent input. Another story in Calvino's TZero, "Priscilla," brings into convergence the two Ur-codes which many programmed codes seek to model: DNA and language. An ep/genesis story, the tale depicts the unfolding of the encoded genotype into the phenotype, a physical organism, through Qfwfq's recollec tion of himself as a cell dividing. Calvino thus uses the process of cellular division and reproduction as a metaphor for the swerving "fall" into language: But when you can do nothing because of the lack of an outside world, the only doing you can allow yourself with the scant means at your disposal is that special kind of doing that is saying. In short, I was moved to express [...] for expressing you need a language, and that's no trifle. As language I had all those specks or twigs called chromosomes, and therefore all I had to do was to repeat those specks or twigs and I was repeating myself, obviously repeating myself insofar as language was concerned...which as you will see isn't repetition at all. (68) To echo Derrida's phrase regarding Freud, this "scene of writing" is the act of self-naming which is the fall away from the origin. As such, the situation is evocative of the Unnamable's first utterance in the third novel of Beckett's</page><page sequence="5">Calvino and Codes 71 trilogy: "I say I, unbelieving" (291). The analogy between biological identity and linguistic selfhood enables one to treat both as versions of some code. In his analysis of the play of language as it falls away from its origin, Derrida treats the information encoded in DNA as a set of linguistic signs: "the contemporary biologist speaks of writing and pro-gram in relation to the most elementary processes of information within the living cell. And...the entire field covered by the cybernetics program will be the field of writing" (9). My aim here differs from Derrida's, however, because I do not seek to subsume the relations among DNA, language and technology into the "field of writing." Instead, I wish to suggest that one needs a code capable of such paradox and regressive self-referentiality as language in order to simulate the workings of DNA because, as Douglas Hofstadter observes, epigenesis is "the most tangled of tangled recursions" (159). The technical applications of the ability to read, harness and program codes in the contexts of Artificial Intelligence or computer simulations used in some sciences have yielded impressive results and incurred incredible cultural change in a short period. In these fields, however, while the recursive action of codes gives rise to unpredicatable data, the extent to which codes may generate evolutionary change or self-modification remains unproven. The sheerly quantitative barrier separating artificial and human intelligence is rather awesome: while the human brain contains some thing in the order of 1015 synapses, the most powerful AI simulations have around 106, which renders a scale difference roughly equivalent to the contrast between the magnitude of a galaxy and that of a star system. The qualitative disparities between mind or brain and computer now are the subject of a heated debate among AI researchers, philosophers of mind, and cultural critics. When Calvino wrote the "Priscilla" story in the mid-60s, however, it was during the initial wave of amazement at the possibilities of the computer, whereby he could naturally envision an integrated aggregation of literature and cybernetic principles of genetics and technology. Indeed, one may say that Calvino transfused the field of writing to a technological cyberspace: after the cell has divided into Qfwfq and his love Priscilla, the story comes to "a finale that doesn't conclude it, a net of words where a written I and a written Priscilla meet and multiply into other words and other thoughts...." This regenerative process, as it is lifted from its biological underpinnings, moves fluidly from genetic code to language to computer code: "The circuit of vital information that runs from the nucleic acids to writing is prolonged in the punched tapes of automata, children of other automata" (92). "Life," which at the beginning of the story lies in epigenesis, is extracted as a code which circulates freely among all its fields of operation. * * * The possibility that life could be "translated" from a biological to a tech nological embedding, coupled with the fact that automated writing is the medium of such a translation in the story, immediately raises serious ideologi</page><page sequence="6">72 Paul A. Harris cal issues. Calvino's writings all exemplify a position which both incorpo rates the possibilities that new technology opens up for writing, and extrapo lates beyond its functional limits, using it as an imaginative stimulus to rethink the role that literature will continue to fulfil in a cyberneticized culture. This esthetic project has ethical and political implications which can hardly be overstated. It is clearly not a matter of defending a hallowed space for "great literature," but of resisting a polarization between literature and the exact sciences—because, as Michel Serres observes, "The exact sciences take all the places and soon all the space: money, professional openings, techniques, research, politics, power, the religious confidence of the population." There fore, Serres concludes, "we can no longer leave algorithmic ratiocination and literary rehashings completely segregated, without mortal danger. We must imagine a way to teach, with the same gesture, both the poem and the theorem, without wronging either and with mutual enrichment" ("Literature" 3, 34). In his theoretical reflections on literature, Calvino similarly addresses the question of whether or how literature can fulfil such a pedagogical function. In Six Memos For The Next Millennium, he asserts: "Only if poets and writers set themselves tasks that no one else dares imagine will literature continue to have a function. Since science has begun to distrust general explanations and solutions that are not sectorial and specialized, the grand challenge for literature is to be capable of weaving together the various branches of knowledge, the various 'codes,' into a manifold and multifaceted vision of the world" (112). By drawing attention to the word "codes," Calvino signals his awareness of the cyberneticizing tendency to codify discrete discourses, to think of terrains of knowledge in terms of "codes." At the same time, he reveals his concern with a metacode which explores the principles according to which given codes operate. He thus conjoins the humanistic aspect of writing with the technology of simulation—utilizing literature at once to engage the epistemological model underlying simulation, and to transgress the domains demarcated by extant codes and to explore how they might be combined with one another. These goals mark a major historical development in the notion of what a literary author is and does. Barthes's famous proclamation of "the Death of the Author" (1968) and Michel Foucault's influential piece "What is an Author?" (1968) reflect a strong reaction against the dominant Romantic conception of poetic genius. Calvino's notion of the author pushes this de velopment to a different level, however, in that his arguments about literary authority articulate a new relation to technology. In his 1967 lecture "Cyber netics and Ghosts," Calvino refutes the idea that the writer's activity is "a matter of inspiration descending from I know not what lofty place, or welling up from I know not what depths, or else pure intuition" (14); as he sees it, "The so-called personality of the writer exists within the very act of writing: it is the product and instrument of the writing process." The author as both "product and instrument" of writing is analogous to the paradoxical nature of the recursive simulation, which is both its own engendering subject and produced object. The analogy between the technological simulation and the</page><page sequence="7">Calvino and Codes 73 author leads to an image of the writer as cyborg, part human and part machine, or really as a self-modifying human machine. Calvino thus calmly posits that in principle "A writing machine that has been fed an instruction...could devise an exact and unmistakeable 'personality' of an author" (15). Yet Calvino does not mean that in the future literature will be entirely relegated to the realm of technology. "Though entrusted to machines, litera ture," he predicts, "will continue to be a 'place' of privilege within the human consciousness, a way of exercising the potentialities contained in the system of signs" ("Ghosts" 16). Lest this sound like Calvino is merely rehearsing a structuralist analysis of language as nothing but a code, it should be noted that the potentialities of the code are tapped only when words are detached from their usual determinate moorings to the syntactic rules of la langue, when the code is turned on itself, and the rules of the game abruptly change. The insight that language may be conceived as a code leads to Calvino's realization that "Literature is a combinatorial game that pursues the possibilities implicit in its own material." What disrupts this structuralist game is not a differance immanent in the code itself, but the hierarchical complexity of a human mind which changes the rules when some differance makes a difference (to echo Gregory Bateson's definition of information as "a difference that makes a difference"). Literature to Calvino is also a game that at a certain point is invested with a certain meaning, a meaning that is not patent on the linguistic plane on which we were working, but has slipped in from another level, activating something that on the second level is of great concern to the author or his society. The literary machine can perform all the permutations possible on a given material, but the poetic result will be the particular effect of one of these permutations on a person endowed with a consciousness and an unconscious, that is, an empirical and historical man. (22) Calvino's description of poetic novelty recalls Arthur Koestler's observa tion that the creative process "reminds one more of a sleepwalker's perfor mance than an electronic brain's" (11). In a sense, the author as a sorting machine locates him/herself at a point of slippage from one level of abstraction or functioning to another within the code or between codes, like a literary ghost of Maxwell's Demon, one which introduces a productive disorder into cultural language. Calvino tested out this notion of authorship in the 1970s when he experimented with computers in writing texts. As a member of OULIPO, the Paris-based Workshop For Potential Literature, Calvino wrote a piece in which he posited the elements of a detective story and showed the role that the computer could play in combining characters and actions into the crime solution. His conclusion was "that the aid of a computer, far from replacing the creative act of the artist, permits the latter rather to liberate himself from the slavery of a combinatory search, allowing him the best chance to concentrate on this 'clinamen' which, alone, can make of the text a true work of art" ("Prose" 411).</page><page sequence="8">74 Paul A. Harris Calvino's conclusion from his OULIPO work marks a crucial turn in an emergent epistemology that also serves as an esthetic principle, already embedded in a technological context, which revolves around exactly what resists or exceeds the extant code. Taken from Lucretius's atomic theory, the clinamen is a term which refers to an unpredictable swerve in the fall of atoms into their place, such that atoms then collide and initiate new formations. Although Calvino uses the clinamen as a metaphor for creativity, the physical principle it represents also plays a new and important part in contemporary scientific discourses. In fluid dynamics, for instance, the clinamen is "the minimal angle to laminar flow [that] initiates a turbulence" (Hermes 99). Prigogine and Stengers (1982) cast their analysis of the contrast between Leibniz's classical dynamics and a Lucretian theory now at the fore of fluid dynamics as a difference of "style." On the one hand, there is "the model of falling atoms, parallel flows in an infinite void, eternally identical to itself, [which] constitutes an exact image of the monadic evolutions of classical dynamics" (153). On the other hand, this physics is inverted by one which "use[s] the language of classical dynamics to introduce non-classical physics." While classical dynamics described systems by reducing their behavior to a trajectory, non-classical physics enters where "trajectories become unstable, [and] the world of the irreversible begins, the open world in which, through fluctuations and bifurcations, things are born, grow old, and die." Like Calvino's strategy of employing a code only to invert it, Prigogine and Stengers note that this move in physics replicates "Lucretius's procedure, 'starting' with the inflexible and legal order and then introducing disturbance and indeterminacy" (152). Serres uses this contrast between two styles of physics as a metaphor for the role of science in Western culture. In "Lucretius: Science &amp; Religion," he first analyzes the rhetorical dimensions of the clinamen in Lucretius's De Rerum Natura', he argues that it both functions as a physical law embedded in the content of the work, and operates as the narrative rule for how "the text loops back on upon itself at the end of martial events, but not in a perfect circle." Serres sets up an opposition (parallel to the Qfwfq/Vug pairing in Calvino's "Crystals") between Mars, who embodies "the laws of fate, that is to say, the chains of order" which have given rise to the Western science of domination and mastery, and Venus, who "bothers him and disturbs his law." In Serres's metaphorical extrapolation, this disruption by Venus is the site of the clinamen, from which issues "the creative science of change and of circumstance [that] is substituted for the physics of the fall..." (Hermes 99). This brief example identifies Serres's tendency to create a proliferation of metaphor from a single instance of scientific theory or history, a tendency which most North American readers have found maddening. In contrast, Calvino's use of the clinamen involves a literalizing of the metaphor whereby it is incorporated into his textual dynamics as an underlying principle. Whereas</page><page sequence="9">Calvino and Codes 75 Calvino sees the clinamen as the moment in the text which breaks the repeti tive or closed code and generates new narrative lines, Serres freely relates the clinamen as physical principle to the power of Venus, and he then turns both into tropes in the history of scientific discourse. Taken together, however, these two usages of the clinamen suggest the essential tie between storytelling and desire. In Calvino's work repeatedly we see desire played out thematically as the motive drive of the continual unfolding and regenerating of the narrative: in "Priscilla," the process of growth from one form to another entails "dying of love"; the narrative re-tracing of evolution reads desire back into an originary cellular division which then becomes the love story of two camels, and ends with an image of the lovers as cybernetic signals seeking one another in "the circuit of vital information that runs from the nucleic acids to writing... prolonged in the punched tapes of automata" (92). Desire and storytelling become in effect indistinguishable in If on a winter's night a traveler, in which the storyline of the reader's search for the book becomes one big chase after "The Girl." Accordingly, to Calvino the motive for playing the game, for engaging with and disrupting the code, is the same as it ever was: the erotics of anticipation. The clinamen and desire are both figures for the breaking of symmetry in a system or work, an event which marks the emergence of a new order out of an initial disorder. The literary analogue to the clinamen is the entanglement of textual grammar—of chronological, episodic plot or formal frame—by desire. In terms of theories of literary form, the clinamen expresses a departure from the ossified notions of "organicism" which some of the New Critics formed from reading Coleridge's Biographia Literaria, where desire is tamed into harmony. Instead, a formalism of the clinamen entails a dynamic model for open, self-organizing systems or changing patterns of organization, where desire unravels the governing code and initiates a new game. Via the clinamen, the reductive extremes of static formalism or quantitatively complete structuralism and endless deconstructions become complementary terms in a dynamic process. This is not to claim that literature suddenly works in an entirely novel fashion, but to argue that we recognize how fundamental the breaking of symmetry is to what differentiates literary texts in a wider cultural context. In The Noise of Culture: Literary Texts in a World of Information, William Paulson writes that "The principle of constructing a pattern out of what interrupts patterns is inherent in artistic communication, because this kind of communication arises by deviating from the regularities of non-artistic communication, and this deviation must be the source of...whatever specificity artistic communi cation possesses" (87). Paulson's words also highlight the need to think in dynamic terms, for his usage of "deviation" should be taken not simply in opposition to some regularity of non-literary communication, but rather in the full context of the systemic change stimulated by deviation. The clinamen is a deviation from the path of atoms; to recall Serres's precise definition, it is "the minimal angle to laminar flow [that] initiates a turbulence."</page><page sequence="10">76 Paul A. Harris Once we conceive of the clinamen as the site of a kind of chaotic fluctua tion that disrupts the given state of a system—that introduces desire into the code—and in so doing generates a qualitatively new order in the system, then we clearly see that the clinamen points to changing valuations and notions of order and disorder across a broad spectrum of study. Instead of a wish to dispel turbulence and indeterminacy from scientific discourse, we witness a new sensitivity to the potential novelties accrued by disorder: in Order out of Chaos, Prigogine and Stengers place their discussion of the clinamen in the chapter "The Reenchantment of Nature" (291-313). For Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, the clinamen is the physical analogue for a disruption of cultural power formations and represents the possibility to shift from a deter ministic set of rules and ideology to a mobile, "nomadic" one (488-92). Order within any given territory—whether discursive, physical or political—is no longer the function of strict laws subject to fixed determinism, but rather results from a process of interaction shaped by contextual constraints. Thus order does not delineate a static enclosure which excludes all general disorder, but depends on a fluid, dynamic relation between the two. Foregrounding the productive role of disorder in linguistic, physical and political systems introduces a whole new set of problems, however, because disorder has (by definition) a recalcitrant complexity, an irreducible ambigu ity that exceeds the very theories and thought systems which would contain it or incorporate it into their workings. At the conceptual level, disorder puts us in a quandary which is at once epistemological and ontological: is disorder an enduring, objective fact of some facet of the world; is it merely a transitory state of instability; or is it an effect of our lack of information about it? Because this question may be given no definitive, "objective" answer, statements made in response to it must specify their level of description, for what is true from one vantage point may not hold from a different position. The biologist Henri Atlan grounds this problem with respect to the status of "perturbations" in relation to a system: they may exist independently of the system, for us; they may exist in the system or any of its parts; or they may occur at one level of a system but get integrated at a higher level as order, and so figure as a source for functional complexity in the system's organization ("Disorder" 119). The clinamen is the trope for the latter scenario of disorder, where what is perturbation or chaotic in a given state of a system (or to a given observer) generates a qualitatively new order in the system as it reorganizes itself (or as it is seen from a further observing viewpoint). The poles of an initial overall stability and a particular destabilizing effect together generate the living process of cybernetic systems, including humans. These component terms in a single process indicate how the epistemology of cybernetics explicitly ad dresses a major concern in what is generally termed Theory: the relation between global and local, or between totalizing theory and specific situation, between deterministic code and unpredictable behavior, between computer program and "an empirical historical man" ("Ghosts" 22). Whereas the rela tionship of the particular to the universal in traditional organicism entailed a</page><page sequence="11">Calvino and Codes 77 fixed place for the part in a bounded whole, the changed notions of order and disorder and the necessarily level-specific description of any component in a system make the shift from the micro- to the macro-scale an object of interest in itself. Hayles observes that because "the passages from one scale to another [are] rendered problematic, the relation of local sites to global configurations becomes an important nexus for inquiry. Both the order/disorder and local/ global dialectics are underlaid by a shift in focus from the individual unit to self-similar replication across the different levels of a system" (313). The clinamen is a particularly powerful figure in such an epistemological configuration because it constitutes a fluid passage or interface among differ ent levels of order, disorder and complexity. As we saw in the context of his work with the OULIPO group, Calvino used the clinamen as a point of departure to think through the problem of how determinate structures in narrative could be infiltrated, as it were, so that within the code generating a text one could insert a component that would then open up possibilities for other codes to enter the game. This principle we can see later extrapolated on the scale of plots in a text: plots are themselves codes which are disrupted so as to change their frame entirely, thus creating a new storyline—as in the game Calvino plays with insouciant dexterity in If on a winter's night a traveler. We may unfold the relationship between such shifts in codes and ideas of order and disorder from a particularly rich portion of the Six Memos, namely Calvino's lecture on "Exactitude." After articulating "the contrast of order and disorder fundamental to contemporary science," Calvino arrives at the contrasting images seen in "two models for the process of the formation of living beings": the crystal, which stands for the invariance of certain structures, and the flame, a symbol of how external forms remain constant in spite of continual agitation (70). While Calvino remarks that he appropriates these terms from Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini's introduction (1980) to the debate between Noam Chomsky and Jean Piaget over models for language acquisition, it is clear from works like Invisible Cities (1972), that he had intuited the resonance of these images some years before the debate. Invisible Cities alternates encounters between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan with sequences of descriptions of cities in the Khan's Empire which Polo has visited. In the Six Memos, Calvino calls the book a "hypernovel"—a genre he espouses because it "prompts [him] to 'keep it short,' and such structures enable [him] to unite density of invention and expression with a sense of infinite possibilities" (120). Both the Polo/Khan episodes and city descriptions are limited to one to three pages in length, but in them we find identified a specific dilemma or quality. Invisible Cities evokes the imagery of the crystal and the flame in juxtaposing Kublai Khan's sense that his "empire is made of the stuff of crystals, its molecules arranged in a perfect pattern," to Marco Polo's response that he will then "collect the ashes of other possible cities that vanish to make room for the unique and final city" (60).</page><page sequence="12">78 Paul A. Harris Calvino's sense that literature has the epistemological potential to analyze the principles by which codes function—to perform what Heinz von Foerster termed "second-order cybernetics" or "a cybernetics of cybernetics" (5)—is clear from the "Multiplicity" lecture, where he calls on writers to move beyond "sectorial and specialized explanations" to a multi-coded, "manifold vision of the world" (112). A method born of squaring cybernetics dramatizes or dissolves some such sectorial oppositions by moving to a meta-level perspective from which polarized terms are integrated into—or indeed are the generative components of—the functioning of a more complex system. For instance, the Chomsky/Piaget debate over the crystal/flame models yields the terms that Atlan sets up as the polarity between two forms of death that together generate life, as seen in his major theoretical work, Entre le cristal et la fumée: essai sur /' organisation du vivant. Calvino makes a similar move in the context of discussing the adherents to the respective "Parties" of the crystal and the flame in the "language and learning" debate: he breaks down their binary relation by employing "A more complex symbol, which has given me greater possibilities of expressing the tension between geometric rationality and the entanglements of human lives, that of the city" (Memos 71). As he himself attests in the Six Memos, Invisible Cities is the work in which Calvino best sustains and probes the tension between the geometric symmetry of the crystal and the entanglements of the flame: he observes that in the novel he "built up a multi-faceted structure" in which the cities emerge in "a series that does not imply logical sequence or a hierarchy, but a network in which one can follow multiple routes and draw multiple, ramified conclusions" (71). The clinamen may serve as a trope for this generative capacity because it marks both the unraveling of a dominant code and the passage from one code to another. In turn, the textual domain takes on a quality of potentiality, a flexible multipli-city where the work is both more and less than its ostensible object of representation. While Calvino infused many of his writings with themes borrowed from cybernetic epistemologies and technology, Invisible Cities may be read quite literally as a cybernetic fiction; it has a formal structure that precisely models the process of cybernetic simulation, while simultaneously assuring the openness of that process by incorporating (tropologically) the clinamen at each of its iterations. We could begin by taking the intermittent episodes involving Marco Polo and Kublai Khan as the parameters of a meta-narrative system that searches for codes which would adequately simulate the Khan's empire, that could in other words account for and map the cities in the empire. In the opening passage, the scene is this: While the empire has fallen into "an endless, formless ruin," it is "only in Marco Polo's accounts [that] Khan [is] able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle that it would escape the termites' gnawing" (5-6). The always yet emergent, in-process "pattern"—of cities and text alike—is formed out of the pathways that Marco's and Kublai's system traverses. The literary form of the text announces its cybernetic theme: we may in a slightly</page><page sequence="13">Calvino and Codes 79 overdetermined manner think of the table of contents as the algorithm for running the Invisible Cities program, for it simulates a self-generative system looping back on itself: the headings Calvino uses—"Cities and Memory," "Cities and Desire," and so on—follow a symmetrical sequence of 1; 1,2; 1,2,3; etc. This global pattern, in itself simply a framing formalism, is replicated in self-similar fashion at the local level of each city of the empire—a single code is posited, which then is used to describe a city, but at the end it loops back to itself and in so doing gives rise to a new code. Thus the meta statements garnered from each city need not remain consistent: the city of Hypatia teaches Polo that "There is no language without deceit" (48), while the city called Olivia demonstrates for him that "Falsehood is never in words; it is in things" (62). What Calvino dramatizes through the systematic discourse of Polo and Khan is how such large-scale simulations undergo sudden qualita tive changes due to a chaotic fluctuation that entangles the recursive action of their codes, so that the code is always in a dynamic process of self-modification. The initial condition of the textual system, the site from which its subse quent paths open out, is Venice. Venice is the desired limit of the stories, both the tacit subject and unspoken object of all of Polo's narrations of the cities in Khan's empire, as we see in his response to Khan's realization that Polo has never spoken of his home city. Marco smiled. "What else do you think I have been talking to you about?" The emperor did not turn a hair. "And yet I have never heard you mention that name." And Marco said: "Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice....To distinguish the other cities' qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice." (86) Each city refers back to this initial, dimensionless site because of the precisely recursive pattern according to which the series of cities unfolds. In turn, it is the step of this re-calling (calling back up) of an only implicit origin which generates the subsequent differences that make up the information of the other cities—a step linked to desire in the context of the cell-dividing in "Priscilla." With each step in this iterative process comes new complexities, for at the moment the limit in the combinatory functioning of a code is reached and transgressed, it splits in two: it simultaneously is rendered an abstraction—a meta-language bereft of its referent language—and an object-language with no meta-language, which thus makes the map of the territory materialize as a physical object itself. This subsequent object then becomes a whole new territory in need of new mapping. To ground these observations one might turn to Calvino's uses of the game of chess as a metaphoric example of such a code. In the next to last section of Invisible Cities, Khan concludes that for "the invisible order that sustains cities...no model could stand up to the comparison of chess" (122). And indeed, the chess model suggests a topography for an order from which the invisible cities could be derived—that in other words could function as a</page><page sequence="14">80 Paul A. Harris figure for the work's formal process. The fifty-five cities and nine scenarios in Khan's garden total sixty-four narrative segments with which we may simulate our own chess board. Also, the strategical impetus by which a chess game unfolds mirrors our tacit method in accommodating the tableaux in Calvino's work: each involves assimilating a local site or situation and mapping it on to a global pattern we wish to achieve. It is in fact exactly this mapping proce dure that sets apart the expert chess player from the casual one or indeed a technological one. Chess programs on the computer work by planning ahead and calculating the possibilities of every move, while humans can think at a higher level which seems intuitive—and instantly excludes bad moves, com prehending the board more holistically. Chess is an effective metaphor for these mapping activities because it is so essentially a game of power, and the mapping of a territory may involve its colonization or an attempt to possess it fully by knowing all of its contours. In Invisible Cities, the desire of storytelling—Polo's weaving of the tale, a mournful attempt to recover his beloved Venice—is inscribed in the form of power peculiar to narrative and simulation, evident in the quest of the Great Khan. In his meditation on Calvino's novel, William Gass observes that the pathways we may follow through it are "only incidentally a set of paths, for [they] are principally corridors of power, influence, force" (141). Yet while codes are the harbingers and means of power in the hyperreal realm of simulations, Calvino's literary network suggests that conceiving of the power in codes in merely two-dimensional terms—as if this power is purely digitalized information devoid of context—is an oversimplification. One thinks here of a cultural critique such as that offered by Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard uses the shift in the meaning of simulation from imitation to "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality" to argue that now "the map precedes the territory." He then asserts that of the "fable of the real," "perhaps only the allegory of the Empire remains. For it is with the same Imperialism that present-day simulators try to make the real ... coincide with their simulation models" (2). This description is in a certain way consistent with specific facets of Calvino's work: some of the cities Polo depicts may or may not actually exist; his maps for the Khan precede any experience the Emperor has had of them. The Khan's Imperialism and desperate desire for control over his Empire thematically embody the cultural pathology identified by Baudrillard. For Baudrillard, however, the cultural sphere has become a sprawling "hyperreal, the product of an irradiating synthesis of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere" (3). There is no "atmosphere" in Baudrillard's hyperreal because it is a "social and historical program" designed "for social control by anticipation, simulation and programming, and indeter minate mutation directed by the code" (110-11). By contrast, Calvino's cultural simulation does not impose a global deter minism because local indeterminacies engender global change at the level of the system itself. Furthermore, literature functions as a meta-technology which weaves the code into configurations of difference. Among the literary values</page><page sequence="15">Calvino and Codes 81 that Calvino recommends to the next millennium is "Quickness," because "in an age when other fantastically speedy, widespread media are triumphing, and running the risk of flattening all communication onto a single, homogeneous surface, the function of literature is communication between things that are different simply because they are different, not blunting but even sharpening the differences between them..." (Memos 45). Such differences are accentu ated in Invisible Cities, where the multiple routes within the simulation gen erated by the recursive code serve to trace lines of a power which dissipates at the bifurcation point described above: where the code becomes both an abstraction and an object to which we have an immediate relation. Calvino uses a math ematical metaphor to describe this bifurcation when he speaks of the aim to create "a literature raised to the second power and, at the same time, a literature that is like the extraction of the square root of itself' (Memos 51). This figure for the multi-dimensional vectors of power which a literary language game or linguistic system may trace forges a convenient verbal link between "power" and shifting levels of logical typing: the metaphor plays on the slipperiness of "power" once it functions in a sign system. In the context of the example of chess as a code, Khan's chessboard is in a sense the empire raised to the second power, the empire rendered geometrically and immaterialized into an empty Platonic Form: "By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Khan had arrived at...the definitive conquest, of which the empire's multiform treasures were only illusory enve lopes." At this point, the simulation displaces the real, so that "the empire was hidden in the pattern drawn by the angular shift of the knight, by the diagonal passages opened by the bishop's incursions." Yet precisely at this Baudrillardian moment when the code has been hypostatized, its essence is revealed as being invisible, dimensionless: Khan's entire chess-simulated empire "was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness..." (123). The code, abstracted on itself, raised to the second power, becomes ungrounded: it no longer continues to generate iterations of the same simula tion. And precisely at this site, another passage opens out when this Platonized Form is enfolded on itself, when the remnant of the code is recursively used as a new input—or in the language of the imagery we are employing, when that apparently hollow ground has its square root dug. Calvino's literary ploy, which serves as an equivalent to taking a square root, uses the chess model to show how when there is a jump in levels in the functioning of a code, there may result sudden, total changes in the game its rules uphold. After Khan has raised the chess model to the second power and arrived at "the square of planed wood," the square root of the wood asserts itself: Then Marco Polo spoke: "Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in the year of a drought: you see how its fibres are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night's frost forced it to desist." (131)</page><page sequence="16">82 Paul A. Harris If the city provides Calvino with an intersection between "geometric rational ity and the entanglements of human lives," the workings of the code demon strate that it is clearly the multiplicitous nature of human lives that spills out across and effaces the edged lines of the perfect simulation. The ideal chess board simulation for the cities is subverted at the site of the clinamen, in this case Polo's inversion of the chessboard and the usual rules governing it, from which issues "the quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood...Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows..." (132). From the complexities that issue from a single textual surface emerges a multiplicity of objects defined by their very difference from one another. * * * The Polo/Khan episode in Invisible Cities dramatizes the interplay in the work between the search for the complete meta-language which would lay bare the principles on which cities are founded and the irreducible proliferation of details, objects, buildings, time, people contained within each actual city. The complete meta-language would constitute a space where the rules of textuality and urban ground overlap, for such a code would simultaneously prescribe how to represent its objects and contain those objects. While Gödel's Theorem in its broad interpretation teaches us the epistemological fissure between meta-language and object-language, however, literature performs precisely at and across that gap. In the entangled hierarchy of Calvino's novel, codes themselves become an object of representation in the form of cities which temporarily hold the promise of being knowable by and indeed "present" in a model—as in the case of the city Eudoxia, where "a carpet is preserved in which you can observe the city's true form" (96). The deployment and functioning of such codes and models, however, remain confined to the space of what Calvino refers to as "potential literature" (Memos 51). This admission may at first glance seem to limit the radical implications of an interdisciplinary mode of literary production, for it implies that such connections have the status of mere metaphor—it is only "as if' literature were a cybernetic code, "as if' there could be a city which consists "of relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its past"; or, one whose "secret lies in the way your gaze runs over patterns following one another as in a musical score where not a note can be altered or displaced" (10, 15). This view, however, fails to grasp the different relation that "potential literature" has to metaphor and model. Metaphor here is not the issue (in a double sense); it is the premise. Metaphors are taken literally: instead of "bodying forth things unknown," metaphor is the body; that physicality is constituted in the nexus of the slippage from the textual to the real, and vice-versa. This "materiality of the signifier" betokens changing relations between subject and object, shifting forms of subjectivity, and specifically, it effusively enriches—</page><page sequence="17">Calvino and Codes 83 rather than displacing—human conceptions of the city, physical order and disorder, space, the cosmos. This simultaneous breakdown and regrounding of the workings of metaphor means that both the "hypernovel" and "potential literature" must be understood in a two-fold manner: they comprise an algorithmic density of possibilities— potential models, potential cities, potential combinations of codes—and are ontologically potential, neither a model for something outside itself, nor an object which is a member of any class represented within its boundaries. Thus rather than relegating literature to a marginal status in a culture increasingly lived out in urban space, in computer space, in media space, literature may serve to infiltrate and explore the differing epistemological and ontological domains opened up in such a culture. Literature will never encompass and subsume emergent cultural codes and offer solutions, for there always remains the mute, unaffected object-world after the textual ceases. Calvino has spoken of his "respect for what things (present or absent) communicate without words," and (paradoxically) it is only such a respect which could inform the meticulous beauty of the array of objects that inhabit the pages of Invisible Cities in such full detail. It is in this process of sliding, differing—of degree? of kind?—from subject to model to potential space to object that events occur, that actions are affected. Calvino's fascination with the city seems consonant with the interest in architecture seen in contemporary theory: both seek tangible cultural objects to sound out and give body to their reflections. Peter Eisenman, architect and founder of the Institute of Architecture and Urban Studies in New York, employs theoretical notions in his attempt to reorient the spaces of the city. Eisenman has worked to undercut "a mimesis of [human] presence" which he feels dominates the current city. He wishes to transform this notion into one of "absence" by realizing the "conditions of memory and immanence" (440-41). These modes of production are consistent with categories in Calvino's novel— "Cities and Memory," "Cities and Desire," "Thin Cities"—in that the cities are generated or emerge out of the tension between past images impinging on the present situation and the possibilities opened up in each subsequent context. Furthermore, Eisenman invokes a definition of spatial deployment homologous to the recursive formalism in Calvino's novel: Eisenman calls for "the introduction of scaling as a recursive, self-similar process....By treating the site as a palimpsest, traces of memory and immanence can be introduced. Here the city...opens and disperses...not only as a condition of its own being but in an exploration of its resonance with changing conceptions of nature and human endeavor" (441). Curiously enough though, in his theoretical appeal to overcome the "an thropomorphism" of our sense of the city, Eisenman ends up turning the city into an anthropomorphic "being" itself, one which apparently would be conscious of its own shifting grounds. While we may speak unashamedly of a "self conscious text," it is hard to extrapolate Eisenman's claims to imagine a city which would "itself' inscribe a new notion of scale and a fluctuating relation</page><page sequence="18">84 Paul A. Harris to paradigm shifts, new codes. And here we glimpse the subtlety of Calvino's imagination: for he was both "convinced that our imagination cannot be anything but anthropomorphic," and yet invited us to "Think what it would be to have a work conceived from outside the self.. .not only enter into selves like our own but to give speech to that which has no language...to the tree in spring and the tree in fall, to stone, to cement, to plastic..." (Memos 90, 124). It is the ever-changing relation between anthropomorphic imposition and the incommunicative thing that Calvino evokes and explores throughout his work. We may conclude with an exemplary passage in this vein, at once an object-language and a meta-statement about the reach of the mind into the world. The last story in T Zero, "The Count of Monte Cristo," ends with a description of Edmond Dantes as he contemplates his potential escape from the Chateau D'lf by imagining the most perfect prison possible: If I succeed in mentally constructing a fortress from which it is impossible to escape, this imagined fortress either will be the same as the real one—and in this case it is certain we shall never escape from here, but at least we will achieve the serenity of knowing we are here because we could be nowhere else—or it will be a fortress from which escape is even more impossible than from here—which would be a sign that here an opportunity of escape exists: we have only to identify the point where the imagined fortress does not coincide with the real one and then find it. (151-52) We may only imagine the range of possible configurations Dantes constructed while in his cell; we may wonder at the myriad potential, invisible combinato rics Calvino has left for us.
