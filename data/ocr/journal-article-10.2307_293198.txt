Happily, Dr. Smallwood has had the foresight to leave at the end of each chapter a gap in the numbering of the documents so that in later editions second thoughts can be indulged without changing the numbers of the present documents. The decision to organize the source materials for the principate by categories instead of chronologically, as Greenidge and Clay did in Sources for Roman History 133-70 B. C., reflects the attitude that the principate was far more static than the republic and that it lends itself more readily to the dissection and the study of its various parts. In the republic events tumble over each other in such variety and profusion that dissection and analysis at any given point is difficult. But the contrasting characterization of the principate often does not do justice to the facts: for instance, an inscription (no. 309) celebrating Claudius' completion of the Aqua Claudia and Aqua Anio Novus gives no recognition to Caligula, who initiated the project (Suet., Cal., 21). And Caligula's plans for a widespread improvement of transportation receive little attention; and such as there is appears in an odd position in the text (2 milestones, preceded by 5 and followed by 15 of Claudius). Surely it is a matter of note (and one indicating radical changes) under religion, or at least under public works, that the people of Pompeii felt a need immediately after the earthquake of 63 A. D. to restore the Temple of Isis (C. I. L., X, 846), while other buildings, divine and secular, commanded less zealous attention. Also, appreciation of the Roman dispensation would be broadened if the vaunts of British conquest (no. 44) were balanced by the decision rendered in the same year by Roman bureaucrats to two Egyptian mothers claiming the same child (F. I. R. A., III, 170). And the foolish adulation of Nero to be found in nos. 64 or 145 could be balanced or corrected by the healthy contemporary election posters or the sly and earthy comments from the streets of Pompeii.

Pp. xi + 137. $5.00. The almost universal view of Aeschylus has been, with many variations in detail, that he is an exponent of fifth century rational- ism and progress, in particular that his Zeus evolves and grows more rational as he participates in the civilizing process dramatized in Prometheus and Oresteia. The more recent view, of H. Lloyd- Jones 1 and Denys Page,2 that Aeschylus' ideas are so crude and 1"Zeus in Aeschylus," J. H. S., LXXVI (1956), pp. 55-67. 2 Introduction to Agamemnon, ed. J. D.

Kitto in Poiesis.3 Mr. Golden also seeks to refute this view, and to reinstate Aeschylus as a rationalist and a humanist. His thesis is that "the application of human reason to the problems set by nature and society is the central theme of Aeschylean drama" (pp. 19-20). He differs from earlier interpreters in treating human reason not as a partial manifestation of a divine quality, but as a separate human quality independent of divinity. The capacity for evolution toward greater rationality, which is usually attributed to Zeus, and to man only derivatively, he transfers to man, and to Prometheus as the symbol of human (i. e. not divine) reason. The fullest articulation of this attitude he finds in Oresteia, and its quintessential expression in the figure of Prometheus. Like the scholars he hopes to refute he tends to exclude consideration of what poetic language and dramatic structure-that is literary form-contribute to meaning, and to base his interpre- tations of the plays on a study of content, primarily intellectual content. For Aeschylus the naif and primitive thinker he would substitute Aeschylus the propounder of " advanced" political and philosophical propositions. Like his opponents Golden believes that if Aeschylus shows the fury of Septem as exercising a "significant role . . . in human affairs " he is expressing the primitive belief that " daemonic powers rule human events" (p. 8). Her pervasive presence must therefore be explained away-as a pretext for violence when invoked by Eteocles, as female hysterics in the choral passages. For him the central problem of the play is political, and has no inherent con- nection with the house of Laius. In his preoccupation with intel- lectual content he does not consider the system of images, motifs, and sounds associated with the fury as the implementer of the family curse, which indicate by their structuring of the action that she functions as an actual force in the play. Whether or not Aeschylus believed in her as a theological entity she expresses in dramatic form, not a primitive mentality but an awareness both sophisticated and profound of the psychological fact that people in certain situ- ations act as if possessed by demonic powers. Similarly, the aesthetic and thematic unity achieved by the stra- tegic placing of the furies, and of the images and motifs associated with them, in all three plays of Oresteia is overlooked. Agamemnon, a realistic character drama, in which the furies serve only as Cly- temnestra's pretext for violence, is distinguished from the progres- sively more "symbolic" Choephoroe and Eumenides, in which the furies are seen as symbols of the spirit of retribution, which is a necessary part of law enforcement. Their function is to implement an idea rather than to dramatize the human experience of creative transformation. Again, sharing the one-sided emphasis of his opponents, Golden can accept their arguments for a Zeus who is arbitrary, immoral, self-contradictory, unchanging. However, he argues, since in Sup- pliants and parts of Oresteia Zeus also has a humane and civilizing aspect (he sees him as purely destructive in Prometheus) and is invoked as the accomplisher of everything, he is not the primitive, 8 " Sather Classical Lectures," 36 (Berkeley, 1966), pp. 1-115.</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. brutal, anthropomorphic figure that one side of his behavior sug- gests, but a "symbol of all the world's forces, both creative and destructive" (p. 109), a complex, all-powerful, amoral, non-rational, metaphysical "first cause" (p. 123, n. 20). The implicit contradic- tion between the view that Zeus is a symbol of all the forces in the universe and the central thesis that human reason is the ultimate moral force which triumphs over Zeus' unclear and self-contradictory authority is not confronted. Apparently Golden feels that the problems created for his inter- pretation by Aeschylus' picture of Zeus as the conventional anthro- pomorphic god of mythology are taken care of by the suggestion that the anthropomorphism is metaphorical. But his own meta- physical interpretation, no less than the rigid literalism which insists on a theological entity to correspond to every mythological figure, overlooks the nature of poetic language, which is to actualize not conceptualize. To call Aeschylus' actualization of Zeus as successor to Uranus and Cronus metaphorical does not do away with what the metaphor expresses, which is not a single supreme cause but a con- stantly unfolding relationship between several forces. The growth and evolution of Zeus can be denied because they are implied largely in the dimension of the plays not considered by Golden. Two among many possible instances are the language that assimilates Zeus' love for Io to Prometheus' creative fire, and the transformation of the instruments of Zeus' justice in Oresteia- bloodstained robe (net) of doom into red robe of celebration, hunt- ing animals into guarding animals (watch dogs), torches of destruc- tion into torches of consecration. This dimension, while it does not always confirm Golden's individual interpretations, strongly rein- forces his general thesis that Aeschylus' thought is both enlightened and profound. HELEN H.

Opinions as to what constitutes a good college text-book no doubt vary, but most teachers would probably agree that a student who is to see Roman history steadily and to see it whole should have a manual that is brightly written with its subject matter reasonably comprehensive and well ordered, free from heterodox viewpoints and above all factually accurate. The book under review, while un- doubtedly a serviceable companion piece to its author's volume on the Near East and Greece, does not everywhere conform to these standards. Too frequently its style tends to be "folksy" (" sybarite has come to mean a devotee of luxury " [p. 34]; "a detached joy that we should associate with head cataloguers in libraries " [p. 112]; "client nations, whom we now prefer to call satellites" [p. 221]; "a senator who is known as Pliny the Younger" [p. 459]).
