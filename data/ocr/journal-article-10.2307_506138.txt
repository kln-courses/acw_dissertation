<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Aegean Prehistory VII: Neopalatial, Final Palatial, and Postpalatial Crete PAUL REHAK AND JOHN G. YOUNGER Dedicated to our teachers, Machteldj. Mellink and John L. Caskey* INTRODUCTION In an earlier article in this series, Watrous reviewed the archaeology of Crete from earliest times to the end of the Protopalatial period (MM II).' We con- tinue from where he left off, focusing on Crete from MM III to the end of the Bronze Age (ca. 1700-1100 B.C.). Our main goals are twofold: to summarize crit- ically the present state of the field, concentrating especially on developments of the last 25 years, and to indicate issues, problems, and areas of investiga- tion that need to be addressed in the future. Some changes have occurred since the earlier re- view and new sources of information have become available: Nestor, a listing of bibliography, has moved from Indiana University to the University of Cincin- nati and is published in hard copy and on diskette, and will be responsible for future updates of the Inter- national Directory of Aegean Prehistorians (IDAP). The electronic mail discussion network AegeaNet has pro- vided a public forum for a wide range of Aegean topics since 1993. Increasing use is being made of the Internet by archaeologists, and the scholarly ac- ceptance of electronic publication is steadily gain- * We are grateful to Fred Kleiner and Tracey Cullen for the invitation to write this article and for their editorial assistance.

Since 1987, the Aegaeum series has provided a timely venue for the publication of conferences and mono- graphs on Aegean subjects, and the latest Cretolog- ical Congress took place in Herakleion on 10-13 September 1996. Authoritative publication volumes for a number of important sites are appearing or imminent, including Mallia, Mochlos, Chania, Ka- vousi, Kommos, Kato Syme, and Pseira. The palace at Knossos, which never received a final report in the modern sense, is now being published by areas.3 Much important information can be gleaned on in- dividual sites from the photographs and bibliogra- phies in The Aerial Atlas of Ancient Crete (Atlas). An important archaeological resource, the East Cretan Center, endowed by the Institute for Aegean Prehis- tory, was inaugurated on 19 July 1997, and will be used by excavations all over the east end of the is- land primarily for study and the storage of finds. On Crete, the Late Bronze Age is a long and com- plex period and presents a variety of problems, be- ginning with terminology and chronology. There is general agreement that the Neopalatial period be- gan after widespread destruction of the Protopala- tial centers at the end of MM II and endured through the pottery phases MM III, LM IA, and LM IB. The beginning of this period and the distinction between MM IIIA and B remain hazy, however. In particu- lar, little agreement exists about the causes of the MM II destructions. The era following another destruction horizon at the end of the Neopalatial period in LM IB has been called "Postpalatial,' based largely on developments observed at Knossos. In recent years, however, it has become clear that palatial administrative activity con- tinued at Knossos until LM IIIA2-B early (discussed below), and certainly into LM IIIB at Chania. It there- fore seems misleading to use the term "Postpalatial" for the pottery phases LM II-LM IIIB early, which represent a period of Mycenaean Linear B admin- istration on the island at Knossos and Chania, and perhaps elsewhere; we have abandoned it in favor of the designation "Final Palatial."5 Society O.H.

Thus, few pot- tery experts on Crete currently employ the terms IIIB1 and 2, or IIIC1 and 2, preferring instead to refer to IIIB early or late, and IIIC early or late. At the same time, there is no evidence for palatial ad- ministration after LM IIIB early, and we therefore restrict the term "Postpalatial" to the late phase of IIIB and all of IIIC. Recently, some scholars have fo- cused their attention on the still problematic tran- sition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Even the nature of archaeological investigation on Crete is changing. Now that Minoan archaeology is nearing its centenary, its historiography has be- come a subject in its own right with numerous articles and books. Increasingly within the last two decades, the old arrangement of unilateral, single-nationality excavations is being augmented by surveys and joint projects involving Greeks and the foreign archaeo- logical schools (synergasiai). In addition, much ma- terial from earlier excavations is being restudied or reevaluated using new methodologies. The move toward surveys has become particularly vital, as Crete is subjected to the pressures of its own population and, more importantly, the exigencies of tourism and a tourist-based economy. It is difficult to emphasize sufficiently the seriousness of this prob- lem. It is therefore of crucial importance that inten- sive recent efforts have been made to survey the exist- ing environment and to safeguard areas of potential archaeological interest. Surveys have been conducted all over the island (figs. 1-3), including the regions of Sphakia, the Amari valley, the western Mesara plain, the Ayios Vasileios valley, Vrokastro, Gournia, and KavousiThriphti.7 The north end of the Isth- mus of lerapetra now represents the most intensively surveyed area of the island. The expansion of tourist resorts, especially along the north coast, now presents a serious danger to the archaeological heritage of Crete. The area from Herakleion to the palace at Knossos is completely built up along the major road, while to the east the sprawl of Herakleion has enveloped the Minoan port and cemetery areas at Poros, at the mouth of the Kairatos stream. Almost the entire Mallia plain from Chersonissos to the palace site has been subjected to strip building of villas and hotels along the shore. The impending construction of a new hotel at Ayia Varvara just east of Mallia and the construction of a sewer north across the plain from Ayios Nikolaos have prompted a thorough survey of the Mallia re- gion." In East Crete, the most controversial plan concerns the proposed building of an airfield in the Isthmus of Ierapetra near Vasiliki to service that end of the island; as of summer 1997, the project was still being debated. Two recent trends are the continuing decentral- ization of the island's museums and the restudy of monuments and sites, particularly those excavated early in this century and inadequately published ac- cording to today's standards.'- A new circulatory pat- tern is being established to accommodate the ap- proximately 2 million annual visitors to Knossos while protecting the exposed architectural remains. Outside Crete, the Evans Archive has been estab- lished at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford (S. Sher- ratt, director). Perhaps inevitably and necessarily, reevaluations of work by the early excavators on Crete LM IIIB can only be distinguished in early and late phases (Kanta 3), and early IIIB pottery seems almost always to be accompanied by IIIA2 creating a transitional phase. LM IIIB seems more or less contemporary with LH IIIB, and LM IIIC with LH IIIC. The character of Subminoan is still sketchy, but Cretan Protogeometric is roughly contempo- rary with Attic Protogeometric. " A.

Recent intellectual developments have also contrib- uted to a reevaluation of archaeology on Crete. The New Archaeology of the 1960s and 1970s has led to the investigation of issues in state formation, ad- ministration, and economy. More recently, postpro- cessual archaeology has encouraged an investigation of gender issues, landscape, and ecology. One source of concern is the failure of Aegean archaeologists to engage in constructive dialogue with advocates of more controversial interpretations of Minoan so- ciety, particularly the popularized view of ancient Crete as a matriarchy.hl SCIENTIFIC STUDIES Major advances are taking place in the area of sci- entific analysis, often fueled by the desire to resolve specific problems (like the origin of the inscribed stirrup jars) or to take advantage of new excavation evidence. Spearheaded by the Fitch Laboratory at the British School and the Wiener Laboratory at the American School of Classical Studies, ceramic and petrographic analyses are beginning to answer ques- tions about the origin and distribution of clays and vessel types. The recent dramatic rise in the number of potter's kilns discovered" increases the possibil- ity of constructing archaeomagnetic and palaeoin- tensity sequences, helping to refine thermolumines- cence dates and to establish the contemporaneity of separated archaeological assemblages. The ques- tion of copper and tin sources, which has been be- deviling metallurgical studies, has spawned its own techniques, notably lead isotope analysis.12 Forensic work on skeletal material, especially from cemeteries at Armenoi (LM IIIA-B), Mochlos (IIIB), and specific buildings at Anemospilia (MM IIIA) and Knossos (LM IB), helps repopulate the archaeological landscape with images of actual Minoans.l' An interest in ar- chaeoastronomy is potentially promising, but its value remains to be demonstrated.14 A new study of early earthquakes promises a discussion of the prob- lems inherent in identifying seismic damage in antiquity.'15 For the last decade, Late Bronze Age Aegean chron- ology has been the subject of serious debate, cen- tering around the dates for the earlier part of the period and particularly the date of the eruption of "0 E.g., G.

MacGillivray, "Pottery Workshops and the Old Palaces in Crete," in Palaces 273-78. We add the following: late LM IA: Kommos (J.W Shaw et al., in Techne 323-31), Miletos (W.-D. Niemeier, in Techne 347-52); LM II-IIIA: Knossos, east of the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Hood and Taylour [supra n. 3] 282); LM IIIB: Achladia (Kanta 178), Chania (Prakt 1977, 457, fig. 1, pl. 237), Stylos (C.

Horseshoe-shaped kilns with sev- eral parallel flues seem to be early, and n-shaped kilns are late. The thermoluminescence dates for the MM IB kiln 3 at Phaistos (late 19th century) and for the LM I kiln at Ayia Triada (ca. 1600) seem appropriate; Y. Liritzis and R.

In the field of chronometrics, Kuniholm's Aegean Dendrochronol- ogy Project17 has established a master ring sequence (CORINA, the Cornell Ring Analysis Program) that supports a date of 1628/7 B.C. for the eruption of Thera. According to the traditional (low) chronology, based largely on cross-dating with the other cultures of the Mediterranean, the Late Bronze Age begins ca. 1600, with a date for the eruption of the Thera volcano late in the LM IA phase ca. 1500 B.C. The earlier date for the Thera eruption shifts the begin- ning of the Late Bronze Age even earlier, to ca. 1700 B.C. At present, the high dating for the Thera erup- tion seems marginally more likely to be correct, and in a recent survey of the material, Manning has sug- gested a "revised high chronology," which is employed here with slight modifications (table 1), in conjunc- tion with the low Egyptian chronology that is now favored by many Egyptologists.'8 Since LM IA pottery, but no LM IB pottery, was found in eruption deposits on Thera, LM IA must end after 1628/7, let us say ca. 1600 B.C. LM IB now appears to be a longer period than was formerly be- lieved, but its end shortly before the long reign of Tuthmosis III in Egypt is increasingly supported by recent radiocarbon dates.19 LM II, a transitional pot- tery style, is of short duration. There are good Aegean-Egyptian synchronisms between Tuthmosis III and LM IIIA1, and LM IIIA1 pottery was still in use when Amenhotep III came to the throne. The latter's lengthy reign appears to cover much of LM IIIA2. Aegean pottery at Amarna shows that the tran- sition between LH IIIA2 and Bi occurred toward the end of the 14th century B.C. LH 111B2 is approx- imately contemporary with some or most of the 19th Dynasty in Egypt, and LH IIIC with the 20th Dynasty. The Aegean revised high chronology and the tra ditional low chronology are basically in accord for the latter half of the Late Bronze Age. The primary revision comes at the beginning of the period, with the Neopalatial period contemporary with the late 13th Dynasty in Egypt, the Hyksos period, and the very beginning of the 18th Dynasty, rather than co- inciding entirely with the early 18th Dynasty. The physical effects of the Thera eruption on sur- rounding areas are being debated as well. Seaborne pumice, if occurring in post-destruction contexts, may indicate industrial, ritual, or other uses; The- ran airborne ash and seaborne pumice have been recovered at a number of sites.20 Ash has been de- tected at Gournia, Knossos, Mallia, Nirou Chani, Pyr- gos, and Vathypetro in Crete, Phylakopi in Melos, Trianda in Rhodes, Cyprus, Anatolia, the Nile valley, and the Near East (Syria and Israel); larger deposits come from LM IA levels at Palaikastro and Pseira, sealed between LM IA and LM IB floors at Mochlos, in the Dodecanese and Anatolia, and even in the Black Sea region.21 Pumice has been found in a LM IA destruction level at Poros (brought by tsunami?) 16 For good summaries and bibliography, seeJ.L.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 and in levels postdating the LM IA destruction at Palaikastro; pumice also comes from mature LM IA deposits at the Amnisos villa, Arkalochori, Chania, Mallia palace (IX: 2) and houses (Zb, Zg, E), Nirou Chani, Palaikastro, and Zakros (palace and House F), and from other deposits throughout the Levant and in Egypt.22 The effects of the Theran eruption on Crete have been variously interpreted. Because the prevailing winds carried ash east and southeast, some scholars have thought it likely that East Crete may have been hard hit by ash fall, perhaps enough to cause wide- spread famine. Others, however, more plausibly min- imize the effects, suggesting, at worst, a loud bang and a light coating of pumice on the northeastern part of the island that might even have been ben- eficial to agriculture.23 Since the final stages of the Thera eruption must have been visible from the north coast of Crete, the psychological effects of the disaster may have been more devastating than the physical. Economically, the Thera eruption must have forced an immediate reorganization of trade routes, for Thera no longer could have functioned as a critical staging post or emporion for trade. While it is possible that the eruption marks the beginning of a slow shift in the balance of power from the Minoans to the Myce- naeans even before the end of the Neopalatial period, certainly one consequence would have been to shift the direct communication between Crete and the mainland westward through Kythera and West Crete in the latter half of the Neopalatial period.24 NEOPALATIAL CRETE (MM III-LM IB) Sites and Architecture The main foundations of Neopalatial Crete were laid in the Protopalatial period (MM II) with the rise of complex society on Crete, the appearance of peak sanctuaries on low mountains, the continuing use of communal tombs, the emergence of the major palaces with monumental architecture, sealing ad- ministration, a push toward urbanization, and evi- dence for foreign contacts.25 The causes of the inter- ruption between the Proto- and Neopalatial periods have not been determined satisfactorily, but major MM II destructions, often by fire, have been noted at Knossos, Phaistos, Mallia (especially Quartiers Mu and Nu), Monastiraki, Apodoulou, and Galatas (figs. 1-3).26 The trend toward centralization represented by the first palaces may not have been accomplished without resistance. Nevertheless, there seems to have been no significant break in Minoan culture, and the rise of the new palaces appears to signal archi- tectural and administrative consolidation at these centers, probably at different rates at different sites. At many sites, new building and expansion occurs in MM III/LM IA. The Knossos palace underwent extensive rebuilding or remodeling in the MM IIIB/LM I transition, traces of which are particularly apparent in the west wing.27 Recent studies have shown that this expansion is not limited to palatial centers: at Chania, the MM II settlement, remains of which are extensive, was cut back for the construc- tion of MM III/LM I buildings; at Ayia Triada, the villa was built in two stages over an earlier Proto- palatial building; at Kommos, a monumental Pro- topalatial building, AA, was replaced by a monu- mental Neopalatial building, T. A general trend observable in LM I, toward fewer but larger sites than in MM II, has been noted in the Mesara and Mallia plains. The MM III-LM I foundations or refounda- tions at many sites are accompanied by extensive terracing, often using megalithic blocks. For instance, the small plateau at Petras was terraced throughout, with a monumental fortification wall with square towers around the base of the hill. While it is fair to say that, architecturally, Crete reaches its greatest degree of complexity in the Neo- palatial period, it is also clear that our general as- sessment of developments during this period has been simplistic. Neopalatial Crete is not a monolithic 22 AR 38 (1992) 68; AR 41 (1995) 69. 23 Vallianou (supra n. 11); H. Sigurdsson, S. Carey, and J.D.

For example, two Neopalatial build- ing phases have been recently distinguished at Pyr- gos. Significant LM IA destructions have been doc- umented in recent years at a number of sites, many of them attributed to earthquakes. Palatial Building T at Kommos passed out of use before the end of IA and a pottery kiln was constructed in its south stoa. The Galatas palace (discussed below) declined and passed out of use in IA. Vathypetro seems to have been abandoned in LM IA after an earthquake. At Petras, an earthquake in LM IA may have occa- sioned much remodeling; the small palace was al- tered and continued in use in reduced circumstances in IB. The town at Palaikastro has evidence of severe earthquake damage in LM IA, followed by deliber- ate demolition of buildings; some areas of the town were unoccupied at the time of the IB destructions. Two wells at Palaikastro with primary deposits dat- able to IB also contain material probably from the IA destructions.28 Some of the changes on Crete may be attribut- able to the eruption of the Thera volcano late in LM IA, though as noted above, the degree of severity of the attendant factors is debated. In several cases, Theran pumice appears to have been deposited de- liberately following the destruction, perhaps in rit- ual circumstances. At Petras, some of the pumice was deposited in conical cups set on the steps of a monumental stairway, perhaps as votive offerings.29 On Pseira, pumice was used as part of the fill under the floor of a LM IB shrine with wall frescoes in relief. Pumice was also deposited under the blocked doorway of a room used as a shrine at Nirou Chani.31 In LM IB, it is not entirely clear how extensively the palaces at Knossos and Phaistos were function- ing as administrative or habitation centers (they both lack significant deposits ofLM IB pottery), but a num- ber of villas show signs of architectural modifications, particularly in increased storage capacity and the restriction of access through areas with pier-and- door partitions (polythyra). The town at Ayia Triada consists mainly of several houses north and east of the villa apparently in two phases, one dating to the end of MM III, the other destroyed in LM IB, though at least one room contained a destruction fill with much LM IA pottery.1 The town at Zakros is spread over two hills, Ayios Antonios to the west and a long ridge north and northeast of the palace.32 At least 10 houses on Ayios Antonios and an additional 15 on the northeast ridge have been excavated, reveal- ing a closely packed settlement with large houses, many of which are terraced. At least one house, Hogarth's House A, was destroyed by fire presum- ably in LM IB, but other houses, like Hogarth's I/J, were destroyed by earthquake, while some of the houses on Ayios Antonios seem to have been aban- doned in LM IA. The situation is similarly uneven in East Crete. The town of Mochlos seems to have been expand- ing, perhaps under an influx of new settlers.3 A LM IB industrial area has been identified on the shore of Crete opposite Mochlos, and a farmhouse at Cha- linomouri was established nearby at the same time. The town on Pseira reached its greatest size with ap- 28 Pyrgos: AR 41 (1995) 68; Kommos, Building T: AR 42 (1996) 42-43; Vathypetro: Atlas 282-85;J. Driessen and I.A. Sakellarakis, in R.

At Petras, much of the LM IA settlement was aban- doned, and a decline in the quality of LM IB archi- tecture has been observed. Similarly, as noted above, less of the area of the town of Palaikastro was oc- cupied in IB than in IA. It is also clear that our terminology for describ- ing some of the main architectural features on Crete during the Neopalatial period is no longer adequate. Within the architectural landscape of Crete, there have been three traditional foci of investigation: the palaces, villas, and towns. As noted earlier, however, attempts have been made in recent years in many parts of the island to understand these in terms of their wider territorial settings. The archaeological preoccupation with the Mi- noan palaces is evident in the very title of this re- view, but the meaning of the term is still being de- bated even after a symposium was dedicated to the subject in 1984.3 The term "palace" has tradition- ally been applied to large court-centered buildings with sophisticated stone architecture that provided for the storage of agricultural produce and its dis- tribution to the surrounding community, housed workshops, and served ritual needs.36 In Protopala- tial Crete, the palaces generally functioned as the heads of agricultural states, whose territories may have been defined by the natural landscape.7 An important role of the palaces was the systematic man- ufacture of wine, beginning in the Protopalatial period and peaking in the Neopalatial era, and of oil, beginning in the Neopalatial period and peak- ing in Final Palatial times."3 If we are to think away the usual romantic notions about what constitutes a palace, we might do better to substitute the more neutral term "regional center"' especially since there is no evidence that the protopalaces or new palaces were the seats of authority for a king or queen.39 Four major Neopalatial palaces with Protopalatial predecessors have been excavated on Crete: Knos- sos, Phaistos, Mallia, and Zakros. These vary in size. Three of the palaces (Knossos, Mallia, and Phaistos) are also characterized by a sizable west court crossed by raised walkways, like modern sidewalks. A fifth palace recently identified at Galatas in the Pediada plain near Kastelli is still being excavated. A sixth (undiscovered) palace may have existed at Chania in the west, and it would be surprising if there is not a seventh still to be discovered in the Rethym- non area, perhaps at Stavromenos-Chamalevri east of the modern town. Monumental Building T at Kom- mos consists of four wings arranged around a cen- tral court larger than the one at Zakros but smaller than the one at Phaistos; by current definitions, it too could be classed as a palace, perhaps even in- cluding its Protopalatial predecessor AA.4" A sump- tuous building at Tourkogeitonia in Archanes near Knossos has architecture that looks palatial, but it has not been excavated in its entirety, and thus it is not clear whether a central court is present.4' Some court-centered buildings are much smaller than the main palaces, an example of which is cur- rently being excavated at Petras in northeastern ~4 Pseira: Atlas 262-67; P.P.

Cen- tral courts vary in size from 1,458 m2 in the case of Knossos, the largest, to just 78 m2 in the case of Pe- tras and Palaikastro Building 6, with a wide range in between.45 The court in Building T at Kommos is shorter than those in the major palaces, but pro- portionately much wider. Thus, not only are there more palaces than we had suspected, but some seem to exist in the im- mediate territory of another (Archanes is only 8 km from Knossos, and Kommos 7 km from Phaistos and Ayia Triada). Given the wide range of court-centered buildings in Neopalatial Crete, it would be useful if we knew more about how they functioned in re- lationship to one another and to their communities. Also, now that we are coming to recognize varieties of court-centered buildings across Crete, it is increas- ingly clear that two structures stand apart from the rest as "superpalaces" in terms of sheer size and archi- tectural sophistication: Knossos and Phaistos. With the rise of the new palaces in MM III-LM I certain general changes have been noted. These palaces have less space for storage and redistribu- tion, but more areas for ceremonial activity. Access to the palaces from outside becomes more restricted. In most cases, the dimensions of the central court are reduced. This situation contrasts markedly with the more fluid boundaries of the earlier palaces. Two new court-centered buildings discovered at Galatas and Petras change our fundamental concept of the Minoan palace. Galatas, excavated by G. Re- themiotakis,46 crowns a small plateau overlooking the Pediada, with a steep precipice on the west side and gentler slopes to the north, south, and east (fig. 4). Traces of a substantial surrounding community, including a house with floral fresco decoration, have been detected. From its location, this center must have commanded routes northeast to Kastelli, south to Arkalochori, and northwest to Knossos. A large paved central court oriented north-south is enclosed by wings; that on the east has been al- most completely excavated (including a pillar hall with four piers enclosing a large rectangular hearth, a polythyron, and storerooms with pithoi), the west and south wings are poorly preserved, and the north wing remains to be investigated, except for a small stoa bordering on the court. There appears to be no room for a west court on the plateau. At the north end of the central court is an impressive facade of ashlars resting on a substantial euthynteria, and at least 50 ashlar blocks on the site carry deeply carved mason's marks. The phasing at Galatas appears substantially differ- ent from the other palaces: there is occupation in EM I/II and MM IB-II, but apparently no palace in MM II. The east wing, constructed in MM IIIA, has Knossian affinities in architecture, pottery, and scraps of frescoes with pictorial decoration in miniature; the west wing, overlying substantial architectural re- mains of the MM II period, dates to MM IIIB/LM IA. The main phase of the complex is MM IIIB-LM IA, but it seems to have been in decline before a de- struction in IA, since anly remodeling, including door blockings, was undertaken during this period. Thus far there are no traces of LM IB or LM III ma- terial at all, and at the end of the Neopalatial period Galatas may have been supplanted by Kastelli. Petras, excavated by M. Tsipopoulou, lies a little to the east of Siteia and almost on the coast, occupy- ing a small plateau overlooking the surrounding ter- ritory where the Pandelis River empties into the sea. Here, the central court, oriented north-south, is quite small, with the most extensive wing located to the west. The building is actually larger in its LM IA 42 Petras: M.

Rethemiotakis) phase; during LM IB, the size of the court was re- duced slightly, and a series of storerooms was built at a lower level on the north, using large ashlar blocks with mason's marks, replacing the impressive, wide staircase of the earlier phase. Despite its small size, the commanding location of Petras, its wine press, Hieroglyphic documents, Linear A tablets, and small finds suggest that it was an important administrative center for the region. In addition to the palaces, smaller freestanding buildings appeared with palatial architectural fea- tures but without central courts, which for the sake of convenience we call villas, following Evans.47 Whether villas originated in the Protopalatial period is debated, but it is clear that the type proliferated in Neopalatial times, and began to disappear after the LM IB destructions, at the same time as many of the palace centers. This indicates that the villas and palaces formed part of the same basic system. The largest concentration of villas is located around Knossos, and the majority of excavated examples have been found in Central and East Crete, but the villa at Nerokourou near Chania (MM III/LM I) attests to the fact that the type was already established in the west from the beginning of the Neopalatial period.48 At the "Minoan Villa" conference in 1992, an at- tempt was made to define a typology for the various types of villas and their functions, following useful guidelines set down by McEnroe for the analysis and classification of Neopalatial houses. Suburban villas cluster around palaces such as Knossos and Mallia, manorial villas served as centers in small towns, and country villas or country houses stood alone in the landscape. Some villas seem to have consisted of one structure linked to another freestanding structure that was subordinate to it: these subsidiary structures have been called villa annexes.49 Unfortunately, almost all of these terms are prob- lematic. The term "villa" itself has romantic 19th- century overtones of the leisure life, and the adjec- tive "manorial" similarly conjures up associations of a rural gentry. Such concepts may have been com- pletely foreign to Minoan society. Moreover, the 47 Various papers in Hagg (supra n. 28); G. Cadogan, "Was There a Minoan Landed Gentry?" BICS 18 (1971) 145-48; J.

The villas around the Knossos pal- ace, for example, are generally far more "palatial" in appearance than the houses around some of the smaller palaces like Mallia or Zakros. It would be useful if we could distinguish between administrative centers and residences, and between urban and rural expressions, and so discard the term "villa" entirely. A wide range of house types, some of them quite sophisticated, have been identified in the excavated towns of Gournia, Chania, Knossos, Mallia, Mochlos, Palaikastro, Pseira, and Zakros.50 At Kastelli, excavation under the modern town has revealed at least one large Neopalatial building of two phases. The structure is monumental and in- cludes a Minoan hall with polythyron, storerooms with pithoi, and small finds suggestive of feasting or libations.51 The lack of excavation around some so-called vil- las makes it unclear whether they stood alone in the countryside, as they appear to us today, or in the midst of urbanized areas. For example, it seems clear that urban areas of greater or lesser extent surrounded the main structures at Ayia Triada, Archanes Tour- kogeitonia, Kannia, Tylissos, Nirou Chani, Vathype- tro, Pyrgos, and Nerokourou.52 More likely to qual- ify as actual country houses are structures at Zou and Achladia (both inland from Siteia at the east end of Crete), at Epano Zakros, and at Sklavokam- bos, west of Tylissos and Knossos.53 These are lo- cated in the agricultural hinterland, some distance away from any major palace center, but even so may have been surrounded by outbuildings and associ- ated structures.54 Achladia and Zou, for example, consisted of clusters of two or three buildings, and further excavation might show that their settlements were even more extensive. Some important buildings do not fit the designation of either palace or villa. At Zominthos, on the Minoan road up to the Idaian Cave, a massive building has been partly excavated that may have served as a caravanserai, or a hotel for visitors.55 Despite their architectural diversity, many town houses and even country houses imitate palatial ar- chitectural features or furnishings, a type of emu- lation that has been termed the "Versailles effect."56 Such emulation need not imply control of the villas by the palaces; in fact, the evidence for late archi- tectural modifications that include storage areas for agricultural products as at Nirou Chani and for Linear A documents as at Chania House I may sug- gest that during LM IB many of the town houses and country houses were taking over some palatial func- tions. While this apparent decentralization could be read as a sign that palatial control over outlying cen- ters was weakening, it might signal the opposite: that the palaces were extending their control into distant regions. It is difficult to see how some villas could have operated outside the authority of a nearby palace. Tylissos, for instance, overlooks a fertile agricultural area immediately to the west of Knossos and just 13 km from it. From Tylissos, a direct Minoan route would have led through the gorge on the slopes of the Ida massif up to Sklavokambos and eventually up to Zominthos and the Idaian Cave.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 identity of the occupants of the town houses and country houses. To some, they were members of a wealthy upper class who were taxed by the palaces and took part in the palatial redistributive system.57 Others have suggested an agricultural base for at least some of these people, as members of a Minoan landed gentry.58 A third suggestion is that the villas were the seats of members of a priestly class in a theocratic state.59 It is quite likely that these regional centers performed several or all of these functions, at least in part. All of the operating palaces were surrounded by towns, though some towns like Pseira flourished with- out palaces. The main organizing architectural fea- ture in most towns was the plateia, or town square, which probably served the same centralizing func- tion as the palatial courtyards. Like the palaces, many of the towns seem to have had mixed economies that depended on a combination of agriculture, seafar- ing, and trade. We do not yet know how to read the architecture of these towns in relation to that of the palatial centers, however, and several types of polit- ical structures thus may have coexisted throughout the island. Most of the excavated towns are concentrated at the east end of the island.6? Gournia, at the north end of the Isthmus of lerapetra, was excavated at the beginning of the 20th century by a pioneering pair of women archaeologists, Harriet Boyd and Edith Hall. The architecture of most of the houses there is fairly humble. Along the north coast of Crete east of Gournia are two more extensively excavated towns, Mochlos and Pseira. Mochlos, originally a small pen- insula and now an island, had protected harbors and several impressive houses. A small town flourished on the island of Pseira, which had the only south- facing harbor on the north shore of Crete.61 The larger town of Palaikastro at the east end of Crete is currently being excavated; there are many impres- sive buildings, but as yet no sign of a palace. New settlements are continuously being identified, like the one near the Achladia tholos in East Crete, and a MM III-LM I settlement at Episkopi Pediados.62 These and other examples suggest that Neopalatial Crete may have been far more densely settled than we have suspected. At the western edge of the Mesara plain stands the major port town of Kommos; it undoubtedly had an important relationship with the nearby palace at Phaistos and villa at Ayia Triada. At Zakros, there is evidence for a substantial Protopalatial and Neo- palatial town occupying the hills around the palace. A major town existed at the west end of the island, at Chania, under the modern city. One of the salient features of Neopalatial Crete, which separates it from the cultures of the Cyclades and the mainland at this time, was the degree to which it was urbanized. No single site has yet been exca- vated in its entirety, excepting Neopalatial Pseira, and thus we do not know the exact size of any Neo- palatial center on Crete itself; nonetheless the size of some Neopalatial urban areas can be estimated. The tight spacing of the houses at Chania, Zakros, and Palaikastro implies that some of the major Cre- tan centers might have compared favorably in extent with the highly urbanized centers in the eastern Mediterranean. At Knossos, the eastern limit of occupation is bor- dered by the lower slopes of the Ailias ridge across the Kairatos stream, while the higher slopes behind the Stratigraphic Museum should curtail the settle- ment to the west; the Vlychia stream with the Gyp- sades cemeteries beyond should bound the settle- ment on the south, while the Zapher Papoura cemetery should be beyond the settlement to the north. With the palace itself at slightly under 1.5 ha, we can estimate the area of urban Knossos around it as a rough rectangle slightly over 0.5 km wide and slightly under 1 km long, or about 50 ha in extent, almost exactly the size of Venetian Candia (Herak- leion). If the populations were also roughly equiv- alent, urban Knossos might have had an approxi- mate population of 17,000.63 Knossos is unique in Crete not only in its estimated size, but also in the complexity and variety of its architectural forms.

Despite the large size of most houses, however, there are few features that allow us to determine the function of various rooms. There are few fixed hearths or kitchen areas, for example, nor has it been possible to identify bed- rooms with any degree of certainty.64 On the other hand, baths with cement floors and drains and toi- lets with drains are common. Despite the diversity of building types, Minoan architects shared several basic techniques in con- structing buildings. Extensive terracing with mega- lithic limestone boulders was necessary to support many buildings,65 and the techniques used in terrac- ing were also applied to the creation of small dams on the island of Pseira and probably elsewhere. Some roads were paved, and occasional watchtowers or strong buildings overlooked strategic points.66 Ar- chitects tended to employ materials found nearby, probably for reasons of economy, and they may have used a standard foot of approximately 33 cm.67 The broad range of Minoan building types is also reflected in the Neopalatial choice of materials. Poros, a soft, creamy yellow limestone, is common on the island. Gypsum, a calcium silicate, is found in several areas, notably near Knossos, Ayia Triada, and Pyrgos; it forms in crystals or sheets, and is trans- lucent. When it is burnt (as it often was in destruc- tions), it turns opaque white. Sandstone (ammouda) is found at Mallia and other sites throughout the island.68 Two fancifully named buildings at Knossos were constructed almost entirely of gypsum, the Royal Villa, located north of the palace, and the Temple Tomb to the south.69 At Pyrgos, architects found a convenient outcrop of poros a short distance to the west of the site and a gypsum source to the east, per- mitting the use of both materials in the local villa. The sandstone used in the Gournia "palace" was prob- ably quarried at Mochlos to the east. At Pyrgos, Gour- nia, and other sites near the coast, it was probably easier to ship these materials by sea rather than trans- port them over land. A very hard, close-grained blue limestone (side- ropetra), found on Cape Sidero, was used in East Cre- tan architecture, especially for thresholds and col- umn bases. A less fine blue limestone is the basic bedrock of Crete and mainland Greece, and un- worked or hammer-dressed boulders of this stone were piled up into irregular courses for terrace walls and the lower walls of major buildings. These walls of megalithic rubble on Crete are basically the same as cyclopean masonry on the Greek mainland.7 On Crete, these same blue limestone blocks were also trimmed for thresholds and column bases, sometimes leaving a rough, unworked part below ground or floor level where it would not be visible. Green, blue, or maroon schist, mottled green serpentine, and pink limestone were also used for pavers for exposed floors and for architectural accents, and all of these ma- terials might be used as regular interior floor pav- ing or for a patchwork effect of irregular pieces, sep- arated by thin bands of plaster painted a contrasting color, often red. Waterproofed floors for bathrooms were paved with tarazza, pebbles set in a plaster mortar. The Minoan love of architectural polychromy goes back at least into MM II, when a house at Mallia was given a floor of red plaster panels separated by strips of white plaster.7' Neopalatial architectural poly- chromy is extravagant. At Pseira, red plaster, some- times with white borders, was laid in strips, perhaps between wooden frames. Although Building 6 at Pa- 64 K.

At Archanes, blue lime- stone column bases are set in a creamy poros thresh- old. In the South Propylaeum at Knossos, blue-green schist slabs were used as pavers around a cemented pebble floor.72 Ornamental stone is also suggested in wall paintings, and patterns imitating veined marble were painted on the walls of a lustral basin at Chania and in the Knossos palace.73 Several distinctive masonry styles are known. Neo- palatial Crete only rarely had fortification walls, but these were of the same megalithic blocks and boul- ders used in other buildings.74 Dry masonry consti- tutes entire walls at Zominthos. Megalithic rubble is used to great effect in the west facade of the Zak- ros palace, where it creates an impression of strength, and, in the town on the hill above, House G com- mands attention not only by its location but also for its extensive use of these rough limestone boulders. Ashlar masonry of various types can be found on Crete as early as the Protopalatial period, but its use expands greatly in the Neopalatial era.75 Because shaping ashlar was time-consuming, and therefore expensive, it is not uncommon to find ashlar used sparingly, around doorways, and as quoin and anta blocks. Occasionally immense blocks are employed: one at Kommos is more than 3 m in length. Even in the palaces, ashlar was often used judiciously (the west facade at Mallia, and the west side of the cen- tral court at Zakros). Long stretches of ashlar are an impressive sight, though such facades were usu- ally constructed of pseudo-ashlar blocks (rectangu- lar in exterior elevation, roughly trapezoidal on the interior of walls) or orthostats set atop a footing course. Orthostats are thought to be an architectural fea- ture mainly of the Protopalatial palaces, and they appear only rarely in Neopalatial structures like the Little Palace at Knossos and Building T at Kom- mos.76 The gypsum orthostats resting on a euthyn- teria course visible in the west facade of the Knossos palace are probably remnants of the Protopalatial phase; above them, and on top of a horizontal tim- ber, the walls were constructed of rubble, not the ash- lar blocks that appear in many reconstructions.77 Enigmatic mason's marks were sometimes incised on ashlars of poros, sandstone, or gypsum, not al- ways on the exposed outer wall surface.7" Designs include the double ax, trident, stars, branches, and other motifs, several of which appear as signs in Linear A. As a general rule, deeply cut mason's marks are early (Protopalatial), and shallower ones late (Neopalatial). In the central courts at Phaistos and Galatas, blocks with mason's marks were reused as pavers in the Neopalatial era. Walls meant to support a second story are thick and have an inner and outer face flanking a rubble core or fill. Half-timber construction, also used for upper courses of walls, employed wooden beams in a variety of ways. Horizontal beams laid on and dow- eled into ashlar supported wooden frames filled with rubble, and tie beams laid through the rubble wall core were mortised into ashlar faces by swallowtail clamps. Such wooden constructions added elastic- ity to the wall in case of an earthquake.7" The floors in upper story rooms were sometimes paved with thin, square slabs of stone with beveled edges so that they would rest securely on the roofing beams of the rooms below. These slabs are generally of schist, but elegant gypsum pavers were used at Pyrgos. Although Neopalatial red painted floors are common, the MM III Zebra Fresco, painted in black and white stripes in a building outside the Knossos palace, shows that interesting variations did exist.8" Stone was often used more sparingly in upper sto- ries, and the Minoans made considerable use of mud- brick for these and other walls and for internal par- titions.81 In some buildings, closets were constructed of mudbrick, as in the Zakros palace and town, where 72 PM 11.2, 691, fig. 434. 73 A Knossos fresco depicts a facade resembling Giali obsidian: PM I, 446 fig. 321.

Both ground floor rooms and upper stories could have porches with one or two wooden columns rest- ing on stone bases. Longer stoas used columns and/or piers (sometimes alternating, as at Mallia and Pyr- gos), a building form that anticipates the architec- ture of Archaic and Classical Greece. A pair of im- pressive stoas, not identical in their arrangement, face each other across the central court of the pa- latial Building T at Kommos. Columns were generally of wood resting on cir- cular stone bases and surmounted by square abaci; most of the latter have not survived and so were prob- ably made of wood as well.82 The bases were often of blue limestone, though red was available at Pyr- gos. Breccia, an ornamental stone also used for vases, was employed for column bases in the Knos- sos palace, along with gypsum bases that were some- times colossal. Columns represented in frescoes are often painted red, sometimes black, and usually taper significantly from top to bottom. In the Little Palace at Knossos, impressions of fluted columns have been preserved, and a cruciform base at Ayia Triada sug- gests another type of shaped column. Windows are found throughout Neopalatial build- ings, looking out of ground floor rooms to exterior spaces (e.g., Zominthos, Ayia Triada, Mochlos, Nirou Chani, and Zou) and communicating between inte- rior spaces (e.g., Nirou Chani, Ayia Triada, Tylissos House A). Large windows also appear on the upper floors of buildings; offset sections in the walls of some buildings mark the probable location of such win- dows, as in the west facade of the Knossos palace."8 Several architectural components of buildings are characteristic of Neopalatial Crete but are found only rarely in the Cyclades and not at all on the main- land. These include polythyra, which made it possible to subdivide rooms on specific occasions,84 light wells to illuminate interior rooms without admitting wind and dust, pillar rooms with one, two, or four massive rectangular piers, sunken pits or lustral basins (discussed below; we do not know their exact function, but they were probably not bathrooms as some have suggested), and a large rectangular recep- tion room that we label the Minoan hall.85 These modular elements were capable of almost infinite placement: no two Neopalatial buildings have the same plan. The stone piers for pier-and-door partitions have several different shapes, most commonly resembling the capital Greek letter iota or gamma, and less often the letter tau. These piers are often made of poros or gypsum. Usually only the lowermost pier block was of stone, with mudbrick, timber, or rubble em- ployed above. The general lack of pivot holes in the sills between piers indicates that wooden doors were rare, and curtains may have been used instead. Pillar rooms (sometimes misleadingly called pil- lar crypts) are a feature of palaces and villas: these are usually square or rectangular rooms with thick walls that supported a room on the upper story. In- side are square piers, sometimes monolithic, of poros, sandstone, or even gypsum in the case of the Royal Villa at Knossos. Pillar rooms are often considered to have a cultic function, but many have been found to contain large storage pithoi, and they may simply be storage areas.f" One pair of basement pillar rooms in Building B-2 at Mochlos has a large win- dow looking onto a street outside the building.87 A small stone-lined cist or impluvium is a feature of some houses, mainly at Knossos and in East Crete. In the Royal Villa and Little Palace at Knossos, such sunken cists are a feature of the pillar rooms, per- haps intended for drainage since they may be con- nected to channels. An example lined with pink lime- stone to match the rest of the floor appears in the light well of the Pyrgos villa, and another, drained by a covered channel, exists in Building B-2 at Moch- los. On Pseira, an impluvium with a drain has been identified as part of a bathroom, and another was excavated at Palaikastro. One example in the east wing of the palace at Galatas is enigmatic; since it contained burnt material, the excavator has consid- ered it a hearth. A number of palaces and villas also have low stone benches of similar design. They occur around the walls of the Knossos throne room and its anteroom. 82 Shaw (supra n. 68) 111-25; B.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 At both Ayia Triada and Archanes Tourkogeitonia, benches lined three sides of rooms that opened onto courtyards, suggesting that the benches may have served for special gatherings.88 In the villas at Pyr- gos and Nirou Chani, gypsum benches are situated to provide a view of the interior of the light well. Despite the richness and variety of Minoan Neo- palatial architecture, much of its meaning still eludes us.89 Almost certainly, different architectural styles conveyed different messages to the Minoans, with megalithic rubble signaling low-level (local) admin- istration, poros ashlar a higher level (provincial or national), and gypsum (where available) denoting structures that included administrative and religious functions. These visual distinctions among differ- ent masonry styles may have been especially impor- tant as clues for a largely nonliterate population. The importance of architecture on Neopalatial Crete is underscored by its frequent representation in a variety of media.90 The architecture of palace and peak is shown on sealstones and metal rings, as ter- racotta models, and on stone relief vessels. Tombs and Burials In contrast to the rich and varied architecture of the Neopalatial period, there is a relative dearth of evidence for tombs, though even this situation has changed slightly in recent years. Of the cemeteries close to the Knossos palace, only Mavro Spelio seems to have had extensive Neopalatial use."' On the Ke- phala ridge north of the Knossos palace, a MM III-LM I tholos tomb was constructed of limestone and gypsum ashlar blocks.92 The Temple Tomb south of Knossos on the road to Archanes was used for burials in the Final Palatial period, but its orig- inal Neopalatial use is unknown, and it may not have been planned originally as a tomb.93 At Poros, one of the harbor towns of Knossos, cave- tombs of several chambers were hollowed out of the soft kouskouras during MM II-LM IB and served as ossuaries for hundreds of burials, and similar tombs have been excavated at the Minoanized site of Kastri on Kythera.94 One tomb at Poros, excavated in 1967, has already been published, and a second, excavated in 1986-1987, was in use in MM III-LM I, with rich and unusual finds.95 A few Neopalatial chamber tombs have been identified at Rethymnon, and some MM III pithos burials at Pachyammos and Sphoun- garas.96 The large funerary complex at Archanes Phourni was apparently in continuous use from MM II onward, but again there is little evidence for Neo- palatial burials. The relative dearth of identifiable Neopalatial tombs contrasts starkly with the large role of tomb cult in Minoan society in the Pre- and Protopalatial periods and in Final and Postpalatial times. Before the Neopalatial era, built tombs of several forms were used as ossuaries for communal burials, and many tombs were equipped to allow the living to gather, perhaps on ceremonial occasions as well as at the time of burial. From this evidence, Branigan and Soles have hypothesized a widespread veneration of the dead ("cult of the dead"), with the tombs serv- ing as focal points for rituals enacted by the surround- ing community.97 N. Marinatos has made this earlier cult a centerpiece for her reconstruction of later Mi- noan religion.98 While it is remotely possible that accidents of ex- cavation have caused Neopalatial tombs to be missed, it is reasonable to assume that if tombs had been 88 Koehl (supra n. 31) suggests that some of these may have been used by men for drinking ceremonies, antici- pating the later Greek andreion. 89J.

Two recent findings give us pause: the cave- tombs at Poros, and the complete lack of Neopala- tial tombs on Pseira though the entire island has been investigated. Both suggest that burials were carried out in ways that make detection difficult. One pos- sibility that should be considered is burial at sea. It is possible that, as the Neopalatial palaces central- ized societal functions and ceremonies, family and clan groups may have devised more private ways of burying and commemorating their dead. Art Virtually all the craft forms that flourished in the Neopalatial era originated in Protopalatial times or even earlier. The MM II workshops of Quartier Mu at Mallia, for example, provide evidence for the pro- duction of seals, decorated weapons, utilitarian metal vessels, faience, carved ivory, stone vases, and terra- cotta relief.99 The hallmarks of Minoan Neopalatial art include its tendency toward miniature scale, use of precious materials, often imported, in combination for color contrast and enhanced value, and its sharing of ar- tistic techniques and iconographic motifs among sev- eral media.1?o Most Neopalatial workshops and their products are connected with the palaces and major villas; art can therefore be considered a form of elite expression and self-definition. Stoneworking was the Minoan craft at which ar- tisans excelled from early times through the Neo- palatial period. The commonest types of stone in all periods were the local soft stones (2.5-4 on the Mohs scale), steatite, serpentine, sandstone, and limestone.)l' In the Neopalatial period, harder stones (up to 7+ on the Mohs scale) could be worked: the conglomerate breccia and the porphyritic lapis lacedaemonius; minerals like lapis lazuli, hematite, and red and green marbles (often called jaspers, or antico verde and antico rosso); and especially the silicates: translucent brown agate, light blue chalce- dony, red sard, transparent red cornelian, purple am- ethyst, and clear rock crystal. These new materials allow fine and sharp engraving that can take on sculp- tural nuances of great variety, color, and depth. Most of the harder stones were imported, although their source is not always certain: rich brown agate from Egypt or even Idar-Oberstein in central Ger- many; breccia and amethyst should come from Egypt, cornelian from the Sinai or Mesopotamia, hematite from Mesopotamia, a light brown agate from Cam- bay in western India, and lapis lazuli from Afghan- istan. It is possible that some rock crystal may have been local to Crete, but it was also available from Mesopotamia.102 Only lapis lacedaemonius from Krokeai south of Sparta and both antico verde and antico rosso from Cape Tainaron are certain to be local to the Aegean, and these three stones were prob- ably imported to Crete via Kythera.1'0 Sealstones. At the heart of most of the artistic de- velopments of the Neopalatial period is the "glyptic revolution" (late MM II-early MM III): the introduc- tion of the horizontal bow-lathe in sealstone engrav- ing, which allowed the cutting of hard stones and a greater subtlety in modeling."14 Moving the seal against the drill demanded convex surfaces to allow the artist to see clearly the point of contact; thus new shapes were developed. By the end of MM III, bicon- vex forms-lentoids, amygdaloids, and cushions- dominate the repertory. The new technique, coupled with the Minoan abil- ity to visualize sculpture in terms of both negative (intaglio) and positive (relief) space, affected a wide range of Minoan crafts: carving in ivory and wood, 99 B.

Technical and stylistic analyses of MBA and LBA seals have produced a fairly reliable stylistic chro- nology (fig. 5).1o6 Sealstone engravers, continuing the figural and narrative compositions developed first in the MM II Mallia Workshop, began immediately to experiment with the finer sculpting qualities that the hard stones presented. By the end of MM III the richly modeled seals in the Chanting Priest group present impressive studies of the human figure. In LM I two stylistic groups dominate: in the hard stones, the Mycenae-Vapheio Lion group, and in soft stones, the Cretan Popular group. The Mycenae- Vapheio Lion group exhibits a monumental style: the lions and bulls have powerful muscles and pro- nounced saphenous veins, while the lions also have flame-lock manes whose edges are articulated like fish gills. The seals are fairly common on the Greek mainland (e.g., the Shaft Graves at Mycenae and the Vapheio tholos) and rare in Crete. The Cretan Pop- ular group consists of serpentine seals often depict- ing simple animals, monsters (e.g., the common bird- woman), and people in cult scenes. Contemporary with these seals are those used to impress the seal- ings in House A at Zakros.107 The monumental style of the Mycenae-Vapheio Lion group continues into the LM IB period in a series of groups collectively termed Almond-Eyes; typical seals show sleekly modeled bulls. Startingjust before the end of the Neopalatial period and con- tinuing into LM II, the so-called Dot-Eyes seals de- pict bulls whose modeling is dry and plain. Almost all these seals are made of hard stones; there is vir- tually no soft stone group of seals after the Cretan Popular group until the Mycenaean Mainland Pop- ular group datable to LH IIIA2-Bl. Further devel- opments in Minoan seals are discussed below, in the section on Final Palatial art. It is likely that seals were considered personal pos- sessions and that a person could own, in some fash- ion, several. The large numbers of seals in the soft stone classes, the Mallia Workshop group in the Pro- topalatial period and the Cretan Popular group in Neopalatial times, found throughout settlement areas and in domestic contexts make it certain that the practice of owning and wearing seals was not re- stricted to the upper classes.'08 Since steatite and serpentine are commonly available in Crete, the man- ufacture and distribution of soft stone seals might not have been under administrative control, although a few seals in the Cretan Popular group were used to impress nodules found at Knossos and else- where.~?9 Since the hard stone seals were made from imported material, it is likely that the regional cen- ters commissioned artists to make them; if so, ad- ministrators may have dispensed these seals, perhaps at formal occasions. Among the many representa- tions of people wearing jewelry and strung beads, a few depict women and men wearing a single cir- cular bead, probably a lentoid seal, on a bracelet at their wrist.110 In addition to their administrative uses, seals prob- ably also functioned as amulets,"' and markers of status. The relationship between a seal's iconography and its owner's administrative function has not been much studied,112 although it is assumed that gold rings with cult scenes, discussed below, probably be- longed to elite members of Minoan society. It is likely, too, that seals functioned politically, with a sealstone iconography or style more popular or appropriate in one region than in another.

Seals represent art on a miniature scale, but the technological and conceptual advances that began there soon spread to other media. Stone- workers also carved large-scale figural reliefs, though only two have survived, the pair of gypsum plaques removed from Mycenae by Lord Elgin.114 They prob- ably had been exported from Knossos as spolia to decorate the facade of the Treasury of Atreus (LH IIIA1-2), long after their original manufacture.115 The two reliefs are less than half life-size and depict a bovine standing to left and a bovine running to right. Most other sculpted plaques, however, are decora- tive architectural friezes, limited to the Knossos area and difficult to date. Several segments of limestone and colored marble carved with a triglyph-half ro- sette pattern, rosettes, running spirals with dot cen- ters, or plain dado slabs with moldings along their edges once decorated the palace."6 Fragments of column capitals carved in relief with floral petals were found in the central court: these have flat backs and mortices and so must have been nonsupporting revetments attached to a flat wall surface. Some Neo- palatial frescoes and relief frescoes show the triglyph- half rosette motif as part of the facade of palaces or shrines,"7 and it is reasonable to assume that stone and wooden friezes with these designs existed contemporaneously. Stone vessels and other objects. Stone vases come in many shapes ranging from the purely utilitarian cups, bowls, and buckets to the more decorative blos- som bowls and relief rhyta. Because of their dura- bility some vessels survived for centuries, and when broken they were frequently repaired or their frag- ments sometimes saved."8 While serpentine and steatite were most common, artisans employed a range of harder ornamental stones, including banded limestone from Kakon Oros ("banded tufa"), east of Amnisos, lapis lacedaemonius and antico rosso from Laconia, and the white-spotted obsidian from the island of Giali off the coast of Asia Minor."119 Un- worked lumps of antico rosso have been found at the peak sanctuary on Kythera and at Archanes Tourkogeitonia.120 Although amethyst and rock crys- tal were more commonly used for beads, jewelry, seals, and inlays,121 these materials were occasion- ally also used for special vases. Amethyst was used for two triton fragments from Mycenae and Midea, probably of Neopalatial origin though found in later contexts, and rock crystal was used for a variety of vessels, including a rhyton from Zakros.122 Elaborately shaped vessels were pieced together from several pieces of stone. Attached handles are common, but several vessels also have attached necks and spouts. One globular jug from the Zakros pal- ace is of veined limestone with a separately added neck and two curving handles attached to the body with bronze wires; similar vases are represented on sealstones.12 A distinctive shape of stone vessel is the large, footed drinking cup or chalice.124 The most spectacular surviving example, of spotted Giali obsidian, was found in the west wing of the Zakros palace. These may be palatial versions of the sim- ilarly shaped terracotta chalices, some with applied surface decoration, that have been found in large numbers at the Kato Syme sanctuary.25 From Thera I " B.P.

Another special class of stone vessel consists of stone imitations of shells, especially triton shells.126 One such probable trumpet is the dark steatite triton from Mallia displaying marine rockwork and a low relief composition of two genii.127 Imported baggy and ovoid alabastra of veined cal- cite were occasionally modified by Minoan artisans once the vessels had reached Crete, and are thus a sign of trade and intercultural contacts as well as of Minoan aesthetics. These have usually been con- sidered Egyptian, but recently Lilyquist has suggested that some may be Syrian, and similar vessels were exchanged as prestige objects throughout the Near East."12 One predynastic vase from the Zakros pal- ace had been "Minoanized" through the addition of a typical Cretan beaked spout.'29 Another vessel, an alabastron, had been inverted in Crete, its original mouth plugged for a foot and its body outfitted with new handles and a spout; so modified, it was then sent on to Mycenae where it was deposited in Shaft Grave V.'130 Black or green steatite, green chlorite, and white or colored limestones were often used to make rhyta in several shapes that imitate pottery funnels: glob- ular, ovoid, piriform, and conical. Rhyta and other stone vessels are common finds in the palaces and major villas, even occurring in sets like those from the Sanctuary Hall deposit at the Knossos palace, Ayia Triada,131 and the Zakros palace, where they may have been paired with chalices of similar stone. A special class of rhyta takes the form of the heads of bovines or lions.'32 These heads were often inlaid with other materials for color contrast and to en- hance their value. Since the Little Palace bull's head was found built into a wall it may have been part of a deliberate foundation deposit. Fragmentary lion- and lioness-head rhyta of white limestone were found in the Knossos palace; a piece of the muzzle of a third was discovered under the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Some stone rhyta have pictorial compositions carved in low relief on their outer surface.'33 Only a few themes are represented: marine motifs, bull sports, combats and warfare, cult scenes in architec- tural settings suggesting palaces or peak sanctuaries, and possibly hunting scenes. The most discussed of these vessels is the Sanctuary Rhyton from Zakros.134 A recent addition to the corpus is a fragment with dolphins from a well at Palaikastro (fig. 6). Some of these themes are also found in gold and silver plate, like the silver Siege Rhyton from Mycenae and the gold cups from the Vapheio tholos.35 The most un- usual aspect of these stone relief rhyta is that when human figures are included only men are shown, perhaps indicating that only men made and used them. The presence of some warlike elements also indicates clearly that militarism was a Minoan, and notjust a Mycenaean, feature early in the Late Bronze Age. Koehl has suggested that one vessel, the Chief- tain Cup from Ayia Triada, played a specific role in a male initiation rite.'36 Relief rhyta are often discussed mainly for their artistic and iconographic value; their use remains problematic. Liquids poured in at the top would drain out at the bottom, unless a fingertip was held over the lower opening. It is usually assumed that rhyta served as wine vessels: the larger ones could have provided up to 30 servings in small conical drinking cups, but they would also have been extraor- dinarily heavy.'37 Almost all relief rhyta and bovine-head rhyta, how- ever, are found in fragments, in contrast to the many complete plain stone rhyta. It has therefore been suggested that the relief vessels may have been de- 12t6J.G. Younger, Aegean Music (SIMA-PB 144, in prepara- tion); for examples, see CM pl. 115 (below), and Halbherr et al.

Sev- eral of the surviving fragments are from LM IA contexts, indicating that at least some of the relief rhyta had been reduced to pieces before the end of the Neopalatial period. Steatite or serpentine was also used for offering tables in a variety of shapes. A small percentage of these are inscribed in Linear A, and both inscribed and uninscribed offering tables are often found in peak sanctuaries and caves, less often at habitation sites.139 An incurved example with a circular depres- sion in the top was found in a house shrine at Knos- sos; the hollowed upper surface may have served as a kernos. Miniature versions of such kernoi have been found in the peak sanctuary on Mt. Juktas. Some kernoi have multiple depressions, presumably for pinches of different kinds of grain or spice, while others have small cupules that communicate with a larger, central depression, suggesting liquid offer- ings. Only a few examples of offering tables have been found on the mainland, all of them probably im- ported from Crete.'14( Some offering tables are parts of composite offering stands, like a serpentine ex- ample found at Kato Syme: the table fits atop an- other block with moldings and a dowel in its upper and lower surfaces, and this fits atop a serpentine pier.141 Another type of offering vessel, rounded at one end, tapering to a pointed tip at the other, has been called a "ladle;' and is sometimes inscribed in Linear A.142 Although some have been found in habitation sites, like the offering tables they seem to have been meant for use at peak sanctuaries, and many min- iature ladles, perhaps votives, were found on Mt. Juktas. One relief rhyton fragment shows two men in procession carrying ladles toward a shrine at a higher level.'43 The suggestion has been made that ladles were used to pour liquid offerings, perhaps oil or wine, into the offering tables or kernoi.'44 If the ladles and offering tables, as well as relief rhyta, were used exclusively by men, we have an important example of the gendered use of certain types of rit- ual vessel.

Some lamps have short ped- estals, while others were attached to columnar sup- ports, the surface of which was occasionally carved in relief. A few lamps have been found outside Crete, especially at Mycenae, though one elaborate lamp comes from the palace at Alalakh. In Crete elabo- rate stone lamps come from Minoan halls, pillar base- ments, and other specialized rooms where they may have had a ritual function. Limestone and gypsum stands or bases are usu- ally trapezoidal in section with a hole in the top; double axes could, on analogy with the depiction on the later Ayia Triada sarcophagus, be inserted in the base. Bases with incurved sides have been found at a few sites.15" In a few frescoes incurved bases could also serve an architectural function,151 primarily as supports for platforms upon which a goddess may sit or griffins may recline or for a col- umn flanked by lions as on the Lion Gate relief from Mycenae. A unique large, pierced, porphyry pyra- mid from Knossos is probably a talent-weight.'52 It is carved with an octopus on one side, its tentacles embracing the other sides. Ivories. Elephant and especially hippopotamus ivory had been imported from Syria or perhaps Egypt in the Early Bronze Age through a system of long- distance trade networks with the eastern Mediter- ranean.153 Though evidence for Protopalatial ivory carving is scanty, in the Neopalatial period the carv- ing of ivory is conducted on a large scale. A carved ivory disk found at Palaikastro, but possibly Cypriot in manufacture, and several uncarved elephant tusks from the Zakros palace attest to trade, and several workshops at the palaces handled ivory and other exotic materials.154 Ivory was most often used for furniture inlays and cosmetic objects (especiallyjew- elry boxes and mirror handles), as well as for a small group of figurines. There is little evidence for the creation of large pieces of ivory furniture like beds and chairs, 55 but a small ivory footstool volute has been found at 145 From Crete: N.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Zakros, the earliest example of a type that is better attested in LMILH II-IIIA contexts. While the carv- ing of furniture relief plaques goes back to MM II Quartier Mu at Mallia,156 Neopalatial plaques and cutouts were used to decorate boxes, small chests, and other objects: butterflies, double axes (some com- bined with "sacral knots"), a house facade reminis- cent of the faience Town Mosaic, and other plain or ornamented strips such as those that decorated the Knossos "game-board."'57 Cosmetic objects were also made of ivory, as they were in Syria and Egypt. Cylindrical pyxides, cut from a section of elephant tusk, carry decoration on their sides and sometimes the lid; the decoration is often figural (e.g., an incised cult scene with young girls on an ivory pyxis from Ayia Triada, a bull-hunt mod- eled in low relief from Katsamba) but also purely decorative (e.g., spirals from Kea).158 Other Neopa- latial toilet articles are combs and mirror handles.159 Though many of these are found in later contexts and have been considered Mycenaean works, we sug- gest that most are Neopalatial instead. Three mirror handles from late contexts at Mycenae present pairs of young girls in short skirts and short coiffures hold- ing flowers or ducks; their hairstyles and costumes resemble those of the girls on the Ayia Triada pyxis and the girls in the Thera frescoes.'16 If these mir- ror handles are Neopalatial works, so is the tech- nique of using rivets ornamented with lapis lazuli or blue glass disks surrounded by gold granulation to attach the handles. The most intriguing and problematic ivories are the figurines carved in the round and usually pieced together from several pieces of hippopotamus in- cisor; these figures may have formed vignettes, some- times of bull-leapers.161 Examples have been found in the Knossos palace, along the Royal Road, at Ar- chanes, Mallia (Chrysolakkos), and Palaikastro. The recently discovered Palaikastro ivory youth (fig. 7) had ivory flesh (one arm at least was overlaid with gold), inlaid nipples, crystal eyes, gold clothing, and an incised "wig" of black steatite.162 The ivory figure's pose with elbows bent and hands clenched below the pectorals mimics that of MM II terracotta figurines from nearby Petsofa; it recurs rarely.163 The shaved head with a single thick lock of hair braided down the middle characterizes the youth as adolescent rather than adult.164 Since ivories and relief frescoes from Knossos usually depict finger- nails, veins, and an elongated thumb, the occurrence of these traits on the Palaikastro youth suggests that he was commissioned from there.'65 One serious problem with the youth, however, is that at present it consists of two nonjoining halves with the tenon at the bottom of the torso having no corresponding mortise in the upper surface of the hip. Since no satisfactory reconstruction of the costume has been published for the intervening gap, the restoration of the figure, as well as its proportions, remains problematic. None of the Neopalatial figurines from archae- ological contexts is immediately identifiable as fe- male, and it is likely that all of the ivory "goddesses" on the art market early in the 20th century are fakes.166 A probable Neopalatial work that does de- pict women, however, is the Ivory Triad that comes 156 Poursat 1992 (supra n. 153) 3-5, pl. 1. 157 Zakros: E.

Simple painted plaster was in use already in EM II, and wall and floor paintings with abstract patterns were produced in MM times. It is not until the Neopalatial period, however, that we have our first evidence for figural frescoes, a development in which Knossos again took the lead.170 Wall surfaces were painted in three main areas: major panels flanked by a frieze at the top of the wall and by a dado at the bottom painted solid or with ornamen- tal patterns (often veining); ceilings and floors also afforded areas for decoration.171 At Knossos, the palace gives evidence for several Neopalatial phases of figural wall painting.172 Early Neopalatial compositions include the earliest figural fresco, the Saffron Gatherer, and the Ladies in Blue and the Lady in Red. Later Neopalatial frescoes in- clude (in LM IA) the Grandstand and Sacred Grove and Dance. If these frescoes have been correctly re- stored by Cameron as the decoration of a single room in the palace, we seem to have depictions of cere- monies taking place in the central and west courts, 167 Poursat, Catalogue (supra n. 153) 20-21 no. 49, pl.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 respectively."73 Unusually for Minoan art, these scenes include both men and women, though in each case some women are singled out as more impor- tant than the other figures in terms of their size, cos- tume, hairstyle, and placement within the scene. These paintings thus are important evidence for the exceptional role of women in Minoan society. Out- side the palace, nature scenes involving blue mon- keys and other animals decorated the walls of the House of the Frescoes (LM IA). In the area of the Stratigraphic Museum, a fresco with a repeating frieze of floral garlands may date to LM IB.174 In general, Neopalatial frescoes tended toward figures in lithe and supple movements in miniature, busy scenes, painted with a polychrome palette. The "glyptic revolution" in sealstones may have influenced the creation of relief fresco as well, and developments in media like terracotta appliques and molded faience plaques (for both, see below) may have played a role; the creators of relief frescoes sub- stituted plaster for clay, expanded the scale, and added paint. The earliest-known relief fresco frag- ment, of MM II date from Knossos, lacks human figures, 75 but by LM I, humans, animals, and vege- tation were being attempted, along with geometric motifs. Relief frescoes emphasize the anatomy of the hu- man body,'76 with muscles, veins, and tendons all stretched and active (cf. fig. 7). Faces, by contrast, are painted flat. Men are wasp-waisted and muscu- lar; they wear breechcloths with codpieces but are otherwise nude. Women are usually clothed in brightly colored and patterned robes with aprons tied around the waist, but their costume exposes the breasts, which were sometimes built up on conical cups embedded in the wall (the same technique used in the contemporary large terracotta figurines from Kea).177 The Egyptian and Near Eastern convention of painting females white and males red is also seen in Minoan fresco; white-painted females leapt bulls as did red-painted males, and they even wore the same costume, high shoes, and wristbands. Some scholars dispute that the color convention holds in this case,"78 although this seems to be needlessly creating a problem: there is no reason why athletic young women could not have engaged in bull- leaping. The well-known and frequently reproduced Priest-King from the south entrance corridor at Knos- sos is problematic in its iconography and skin color, because it was reconstructed from the fragments of several figures that may not belong together.' 79 The cap with floral ornaments and plume, for example, should belong to a sphinx or a woman dressed like the small faience Snake Handler. Among the Cretan palaces, relief frescoes with human figures are a hallmark of Knossos alone. Images of bulls and male and female bull-leapers in relief dominated both sides of the north entrance passage.'80 Sophisticated relief frescoes adorned the Great East Hall located on the edge of the central court opposite the throne room.'8' Here, the relief decoration was probably renewed several times dur- ing the Neopalatial era. These phases are now difficult to distinguish, but the pictorial programs included bulls, athletic youths (bull-leapers or com- batants), and important women. There are also leashed griffins, but these were probably not tied 173 Immerwahr 173 Kn nos. 15-16, pls. 23-24; E.

Another fragment, identified by Kaiser, shows a figure wearing a "hide skirt"' the same garment that appears in the Final Palatial Procession Fresco from the west entrance passage, discussed below. If this identification is cor- rect, we may have links between the Procession Fresco and the procession's ultimate destination in the Great East Hall. The hall also included flat frescoes of life- sized women in elaborate costumes and jewelry, the Ladies in Blue and Lady in Red.'82 Toward the end of the Neopalatial period, some nonpalatial buildings were decorated with relief fres- coes of elaborately dressed women. At Pseira, a small house or town shrine was decorated with two women in relief. Fragments of another relief depicting a woman were found at Palaikastro, her clothing dec- orated with crocuses like the Thera goddess and the faience robes from the Knossos Temple Reposito- ries. Other relief frescoes without human figures have been identified at Ayia Triada, Zakros (the palace and Houses Aa and N), and several other sites, in- cluding at least one in the Argolid.'83 Plaster or terracotta offering tables, circular in shape and resting on three stubby feet, were often painted in the fresco technique, and since they show no signs of burning they were evidently not por- table hearths.'84 Some 40-50 of these tables were stockpiled in the villa at Nirou Chani; approximately 30 others were stored in the palatial building at Ar- chanes Tourkogeitonia. The painting is often impres- sive; one found recently at Palaikastro is decorated with narcissus flowers. In this context, it may be con- venient to add the large stucco horns of consecra- tion: two come from Archanes Tourkogeitonia, and two more were found in the Knossos palace, one near the Great East Hall, and the other at the northwest corner of the central court, near the throne room complex.'85 Ceramics. Our knowledge of painted pottery at the beginning of the Neopalatial period is uneven. Developments in West Crete are largely unknown, while in East Crete the earlier light-on-dark style con- tinues until LM I styles supersede it.186 In Central Crete, a simpler, less colorful style supplants the ear- lier Kamares ware. On the best pottery, polychrome motifs on a dark background are repeated in zones, and the standardized high quality of the ware prob- ably means that only a few workshops are producing it, though in large enough amounts to be exported to the Cyclades. Utilitarian pottery, instead, was pro- duced in fewer but more specialized shapes than before. A new ware, with a lustrous dark paint on a light background, is found mainly at Knossos. Pat- terns include tortoise-shell ripple and thick retorted spirals. Unpainted conical cups, the drinking vessel of the period, are ubiquitous. Although light-on-dark painted pottery continues strongly into LM I, the beginning of the LM period is heralded by the widespread appearance of new dark-on-light wares. Some vases combine the two painting schemes, like a conical rhyton from Gour- nia decorated with a band of antithetic quirks in light-on-dark and spirals in dark-on-light."87 Better kilns and firing techniques produced fine, hard wares. A Floral Style and fabrics painted with finer tortoise- shell ripples appear to come from Knossos, though toward the end of LM IA local workshops elsewhere imitate these. At Kommos, for instance, light-on-dark pottery and high-quality utilitarian ware are made in the kiln associated with Building T. By the end of LM IA, tortoise-shell ripple has virtually disap- peared and dark-on-light pottery has increased in importance. The shape and size of conical cups throughout Central Crete become standardized, sug- gesting a conventional capacity of about 61 g. LM IB pottery is complicated. Two main classes have been distinguished: the Standard Tradition and the Special Palatial Tradition. The former represents a continuity from LM IA and a slow development. Motifs are often simplified and rendered quickly. Two major classes have been distinguished, the plain style and the polychrome style with added red and 182 Kaiser (supra n. 133) 281-82, pl. 50; M.A.S.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 white. The Special Palatial Tradition comprises a rel- atively small class but its preference for unusual shapes and elaborate decoration has given it great weight in the literature. The Special Palatial Tradi- tion has been subdivided into a Plant Style related to the earlier Floral, an Abstract/Geometric Style, the famous Marine Style, and, by the end of LM IB, the Alternating Style. Since several of these styles may coexist on a single vase,'88 it is likely that these elite wares were made in a limited number of work- shops and by a few artisans.189 Because the distri- bution of these wares is uniform throughout the is- land, it is likely that the center of production was at Knossos, though there are local varieties in the south, some apparently coming from the kiln at Ayia Triada. By the end of LM IB even utilitarian wares are emulating the high quality of elite wares. Many of the motifs popular in LM IB pottery im- itate designs that were already popular in other media in LM IA or even earlier, suggesting that even the Special Palatial Tradition is following, rather than leading, artistic developments. For example, the run- ning spiral and lozenge pattern occurs on silverware and as a textile pattern on the large faience Snake Handler (see below) before it appears on LM IB pot- tery; strings of crocus buds in garlands or as neck- lace pendants in frescoes predate their representa- tion on Floral Style vases. Because of its modern aesthetic appeal, Marine Style pottery is often reproduced and discussed to the point of obscuring its highly specialized produc- tion and limited distribution.'90 Mountjoy has sug- gested that vases in this style may have been produced primarily at Knossos and that they had a specialized use as ritual vessels on Crete. Scientific analyses of Marine Style pottery from outside Crete, however, show that much of it represents local Cycladic or mainland imitations.'9' Thus, pot painters may be traveling more often than their wares, influencing the development of LH I mainland Mycenaean pottery.192 The influence of other media is apparent on much of the pottery. Some vases take their inspiration from fresco: the polychrome dolphins, rockwork, and sea- weed on a LM IA painted tripod-stand in Minoan style from Akrotiri,193 and the same elements on LM IB Marine Style vases compare favorably with fresco representations; and the garlands on LM IB pots re- semble those suspended from the posts of ship cabins in the LM IA fresco from the West House at Akrotiri.'94 Some vases reflect the influence of metalwork: the spiral and arcade pattern on LM IA metalware recurs as a painted pattern on LM IB pottery. 95 Building Z at Zakros contained a pithos with a frieze of double axes in relief.'96 Other vases imitate stonework: a pithos from Pseira has a seg- mented collar shaped like that encircling the neck and body of some stone rhyta, and at Kythera clay imitations of stone blossom bowls were made.' 19 We should consider the possibility that artists were trained and worked in more than one medium with equal versatility. Another important aspect of the painted fine wares of the Neopalatial period is that pottery was often made in pairs or sets, like some of the stone vases discussed above. This seems to be particularly true of cup rhyta and conical and ovoid rhyta. Archaeologists tend to focus on fine, decorated wares, but plain pottery was always the most abun- dant. Two common Minoan shapes in domestic pot- tery are the small conical cups, which were produced in the tens of thousands annually, and large storage pithoi.'98 Because of their size and shape, conical cups were easy to make and served a multitude of 188 E.g., Betancourt (supra n. 4) pl. 23 H. 189 C.

In a house at Knossos, dozens of conical cups were inverted for stability and to keep the dust out, and placed on the floor of a pillar basement, while at Mochlos they were used as lamps in another basement pillar room.'99 Pithoi were equally important and were made in quantity. These were probably built up with coils of clay on a thick disk base. Despite their large size, they were transported considerable distances; Cretan pithoi have been found in Cyprus and Sardinia.200 Similar pithoi are still being manufactured today in the Cretan village of Thrapsano, affording the ar- chaeologist modern parallels for manufacture and distribution. Since several of the ancient examples were inscribed in Linear A before they were fired (see below), some potters may have been literate or scribes intervened in the potting process. Textiles. Textiles have not survived well, and their study is made more difficult by their scant mention in the Linear A texts.201 The discovery of spindle whorls and loomweights at many sites, however, and the depiction of textiles in paintings make it possible to reconstruct some aspects of the craft. The Minoans made use of the warp-weighted loom, and were ex- pert weavers of dyed wool and probably of linen.202 Fresco scraps with textile patterns from the North- west Fresco Heap at Knossos augment details of costume in the other frescoes, as do the faience vo- tive dresses and three-dimensional figurines from the Temple Repositories. Based on frescoes, there have been several convincing attempts at reconstruct- ing costume.203 Metalwork. Crete is relatively poor in metals, and most of its needs must have been supplied from out- side the island.204 Well before the Neopalatial period, Crete was obtaining silver and lead from Cy- cladic sources, and gold may have been supplied in small quantities from Egypt or Syria. Bulk shipments of raw copper did not begin until the Late Bronze Age, and all signs indicate that Crete took an early and important lead in this trade.205 Copper oxhide ingots first appear on Crete in LM I at Tylissos, Ayia Triada, Zakros, Gournia, Kato Syme, and possibly Kommos;206 their weights center on 29 kg, a Minoan talent. Later, in the 15th century, Egyptian tombs from the time of Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III show men carrying oxhide ingots. The manufacture of bronze, however, demanded tin as well as copper, Cups," in Thalassocracy 17-26. Pithoi: Begg passim, esp. 91-93; C. Doumas and A.G.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 in ratios of approximately 1:10, and a variety of sources for both metals have been postulated and are still being debated. Some of the copper from Crete has been tested but only the ingots from Kom- mos are of Cypriot copper and most of these, if not all, are Final Palatial. Other, Neopalatial ingots from Crete that have been tested are not Cypriot, though Cyprus was a major producer of this metal then and later in the Late Bronze Age. The sources for tin are probably located farther east.207 Since bronze was inherently valuable, it was con- tinually melted down and reworked.208 At Mochlos, several foundry hoards included ingots, ingot frag- ments, and broken tools that could represent scrap metal.209 A large amount of scrap bronze was stored in the Arkalochori Cave, perhaps under religious auspices since the cave was used to house dedications such as bronze swords, along with bronze, gold, and silver double axes. The bronzes from the cave prob- ably constitute the largest deposit of metal found anywhere in the Mediterranean.210 Smaller amounts of bronze have been found at the sanctuaries at Kato Syme and on Juktas and Kophinas. Lead and bronze were used for manufacturing small figurines depicting men, women, at least one child, and several agrimia.211 Many of the anthropo- morphic figurines are identifiable as men or women on the basis of anatomy, but a large number are of indeterminate sex. Of the male figurines, many wear the breechcloth with rigid codpiece and have long hair like the individuals on stone relief rhyta; fe- males usually wear a flounced skirt and have long hair. Some figurine poses are gender-specific. Male figures often stand with one fist clenched at the fore- head, the other arm held straight at the side, while women almost never assume this pose.212 Metal figurines were often dedicated at peak sanctuaries or in caves, presumably as votive offer- ings. A large number have been reported from the Minoan peak sanctuary on Kythera.21 A group of miniature bronze "wigs" found at Knossos may have been used to complete figurines in another mate- rial.214 A bull and leaper group said to be from Rethymnon, currently in the British Museum, is unique.215 Bronze was also used for weapons.216 Type A Mi- noan swords were the finest in the Aegean, and they probably served as the ancestors to the subsequent sword types. Type A swords have been found in the palaces of Mallia and Zakros, and several fine blades were dedicated in the cave at Arkalochori. Before the end of the Neopalatial period, type B swords had been introduced on the mainland, though opinions differ over whether these were produced at Knossos or at Mycenae under Minoan influence.217 Orna- mented weapons first appear in the Protopalatial 207 The ingots from Ayia Triada, Gournia, and Kato Syme are metallurgically similar and are not of Cypriot copper: N.H.

In the Neopalatial period, Minoan smiths may have been responsible for the decorated weapons found mostly on the mainland. Examples of practical metal tools also survive: double axes, saws, chisels, and hammers.219 A small number of double axes are decorated with incised motifs: a plumed helmet on each side, a frontal bu- cranium, and a butterfly.220 The most elaborate ex- ample, an ax from Vorou, has a figure-eight shield flanked by sacral knots on one side, and on the other a single "sacral robe" flanked possibly by quivers;22' all these emblems have suspension loops at the top. Shields with similar suspension loops are sometimes painted as a repeating frieze on LM IB pottery, and these may be ancestral to the frescoed shield friezes of LM/LH III date found at several Aegean sites. A bronze spearhead from Anemospilia, dating to the beginning of the Neopalatial period, is engraved with a frontal boar's head.222 Similar lanceheads and spearheads come from later tombs in the New Hos- pital and Ayios loannes cemeteries. Sheets of gold, silver, and bronze were also used for nonfunctional double axes, some of which have elaborate surface decoration: two from the Arka- lochori Cave are inscribed, and several huge bronze examples were found in the villa at Nirou Chani.223 Two elaborately engraved, sheet bronze double axes with traces of gilding come from the Zakros palace. A few Neopalatial representations show these axes being carried in processions or associated with bu- crania,224 but no scene of sacrifice where the victim is trussed on the table includes a double ax. Metalsmiths also made a variety of copper and sheet bronze vessels beginning in MM II. Their man- ufacture continued on into the Neopalatial period, when the complexity of shape and decoration in- creased.225 Some of these are strictly utilitarian, and were probably manufactured in large numbers. Many of the clay roundels found at Chania are incised with tripod cauldrons.226 A hoard of enormous bronze cauldrons was discovered at Tylissos,227 and the bronze handle of an even larger cauldron was found in the Zakros palace. Other sheet metal vessels are more elaborate, with handles and rims decorated in relief with shells, abstract designs, and even friezes of double axes.228 Many of these relief patterns are cast, and thus are more durable versions of the terra- cotta appliques on pottery. Low open bowls or lavers with upswung handle were made of silver or bronze, often with relief decoration along the rim. Some- times these and other metal vessels were manufac- tured to function together as pairs or sets, like ex- amples found at Knossos and Mochlos.229 Apart from bronze, vessels were also made of gold and silver from early on, though very few pieces have survived from the Protopalatial period.23o Most pre- cious metal vessels were "raised" by hammering a single sheet of malleable gold or silver to a desired shape and thinness.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 gold sources, the metals, and initially the techniques for creating plate, were probably imported from Syria. Few pieces of Neopalatial plate have been found on Crete, although those that come from early Final Palatial contexts are probably heirlooms, and many of those found on the mainland were prob- ably made in Crete.231 A characteristic aspect of the silver vessels is that they use gold sparingly, often for accents. Some Minoan stone relief vessels, such as the Zakros Sanctuary Rhyton, however, seem to have been covered with gold foil originally. Jewelry. Jewelry is beginning to receive the atten- tion it deserves.232 Although many types of jewelry are depicted in fresco, few actual pieces have sur- vived, yet these seem more individualized than Fi- nal Palatial and mainland Mycenaean jewelry, which used a more restricted range of materials and was mostly mass-produced. Neopalatial jewelry builds on trends already established in earlier periods.233 In the Protopalatial and early Neopalatial periods, jewelry and other objects are imported from Syria or Egypt that employ new techniques (cloisonne, granulation, repousse, and combinations of precious and semiprecious materials).234 Aegean artists may not have adopted these techniques immediately. The earliest demonstrably Minoan example of granula- tion occurs on a gold band that encloses a sard prism seal from the Poros Herakleion chamber tomb,235 while the gold amygdaloid jewel from Pylos (CMS I, no. 293) may be the earliest Aegean piece to em- ploy cloisonne. Two rings from Sellopoulo tomb 4 (LM IIIA1) and a tomb at Kalyvia (LM IIIAl-2) carry a cloisonne bezel surrounded by granulation.236 While most Neopalatial gold jewelry takes simple shapes,'"2 especially lentoid, amygdaloid, teardrop, granular, and spherical beads, some items are figural. The early Neopalatial relief Jewel Fresco from Knos- sos depicts a man's hand holding one end of a neck- lace composed of beads in the shape of frontal male heads with pendant triple earrings.238 The Poros He- rakleion tomb included a pair of moldmade gold foil ornaments with ducks against a backdrop of lily flowers, as well as beads in the shape of figure-eight shields. A gold fish-bead comes from the drain shaft in the east wing of the Knossos palace.239 Women's gold hair rings survive from Archanes Tholos A and the Mafeze tomb at Amnisos. Hair- pins, however, have also been found and these tend to be highly individualized.240 One pin found at Mavro Spelio was engraved with crocus blossoms on one side and a Linear A inscription on the other. A silver pin with a Linear A inscription was found in Tholos B at Archanes. Another silver pin found near the Royal Road has a gold finial in the shape of a human eye, a device that occurs as a floating element on some gold cult rings.241 A fresco from Akrotiri shows a woman wearing two hairpins, one like a myrtle or olive twig, the other with an iris finial. 231 Neopalatial Crete: Davis (supra n. 135) 102-109; Fi- nal Palatial Crete: Davis (supra n. 135) 109-17.

These rings have been typed into seven classes with both elliptical and circular bezels (MM II).242 Their hoops are too small for them to have been worn on the fingers; instead, evidence from burials indicates they were probably suspended from necklaces or brace- lets.243 Gold rings with oval bezels are well known for their cult scenes.244 They probably were first made in late MM III since their human figures dis- play a well-modeled anatomy, and continued at least into LM I. How much later these cult rings continued is debated. Certainly the main type belongs primar- ily to LM I, but the number of them found in later contexts and reflected in Knossos sealings has led a few scholars to date them as late as LM IIIA1. The religious scenes on rings consist of a few topoi: a frieze of sacred knots and/or figure-eight shields, griffins and sphinxes, women and griffins, and women at altars.245 The more elaborate rings, however, depict rituals involving one or more of the following elements: a man or woman at a baetyl; a man or woman touching, tugging, or plucking a tree; and a central woman apparently in movement.246 Glass for jewelry was introduced in the Neopala- tial period.247 From a Poros Herakleion tomb (LM I) come ladle-shaped glass beads, a glass seal, and a cloisonne ring that had glass inserts.248 A frag- ment of a steatite mold for casting glass or gold jew- elry comes from the Kephala tholos at Knossos; its matrices produced beads or plaques in the shape of a crocus bud and a "sacral ivy" leaf, both of which were apparently popular forms ofjewelry for women depicted in fresco249 and common motifs on LM IA-B pottery. Faience. Related to glass is faience production, a technique imported from Syria or Egypt during MM II that demands a high level of technical exper- tise and a skillful control of firing temperatures to create quartz-glazed objects in subtle colors. Inlays and plaques are common, along with vessels, sea- shells, and three-dimensional figurines.250 Molds and unworked material from the Northwest Build- ing at Knossos, and the south wing workshops in the Zakros palace, indicate that faience was probably made at just a few palatial sites. Moldmade plaques of faience, probably for inlays, include a wide range of shapes at Knossos: house facades combined to create the Town Mosaic, depic- tions of animals suckling their young, models of women's dresses, some patterned with rockwork and crocus plants, and abstract and geometric inlays. The faience figurines of women are well known. There are parts of at least three Snake Handlers from the Knossos Temple Repositories, not only the two usually illustrated.251 The skirt and hand of another faience figurine were found in the Zakros palace, and the breast of another woman came to light in the Royal Road South excavations at Knossos. Since this type of female figurine is unique, it is difficult to tell what they represent, although most scholars call them goddesses, priestesses, or votaries, and their snakes symbols of domestic or chthonic cult.252 Handling of snakes should be an attribute of the Pot- 242J.G.

The small Knossos Snake Handler with the flat cap also has a spotted feline mounted on it, probably a leopard, an animal that also has parallels in the depictions of later maenads. Terracottas. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines of terracotta were already being made in EM times, and in the MM period they were com- monly dedicated at peak sanctuaries. At most sites, male figures outnumber female, and bovids are also common. Some male figurines half a meter in height from Kophinas approach the size of small statues.253 A few Prepalatial and Protopalatial figurines may allude to the origin of bull sports. In the Neopala- tial era, terracotta bull rhyta, some of them mold- made, were produced at several sites; occasionally the backs of the animals are painted with net pat- terns.254 One bull rhyton from Pseira has deliber- ately truncated horns, as if they had been sawn down. Clay relief appliques, presumably fashioned in molds, were also applied to vessels of clay beginning late in the Protopalatial period and continuing into the Neopalatial period.255 In the Protopalatial period such appliques often took the form of ma- rine shells and rockwork, but some figural appliques exist as well, notably cups from Mallia with entire landscapes depicted, including palms and cats. The relief bull on ajar from Anemospilia (MM IIIA) fore- shadows the relief bulls on the walls of the Knossos palace. Finally, terracotta versions of triton shells and bull's-head rhyta form counterparts to more elaborate examples in stone and faience.256 Other specialized terracottas such as architectural models, stands, and human feet are considered below under "Religion." Furniture. Although very few pieces of actual furniture have survived, we assume that the Minoans were competent woodworkers.257 From Akrotiri come the plaster casts of several items, including beds, chests, and baskets;258 and a tomb at Poros He- rakleion contained the remains of two cedar beds, the components of which had been secured by bronze staples. Wooden coffins259 are known as early as the Shaft Grave period on the mainland, though the ear- liest Minoan wooden coffins may date to LM II and other examples are known from LM IIIA graves. Stone furniture that may reflect wooden prototypes pro- vides more evidence.260 The gypsum seat from the Knossos throne room includes a number of details in relief that derive from woodwork: the crockets on the legs, the curved strut at the front, the con- toured seat, and the undulating profile of the back. Three less elaborate but related stone seats were found in the Knossos area: a low limestone seat from the service section of the throne room complex, a similar seat from Myristis near Anemospilia, and a backless stone seat from Katsamba. The gypsum or limestone benches with "triglyph" panels, found in many palaces and villas, may also imitate wooden examples. The Palatial Prestige System and the Role of Knossos In Neopalatial Crete, local and imported raw ma- terials, artisans and their labor, and finished prod- ucts apparently were all controlled by the major palaces and villas. In these centers the objects would be manufactured and then distributed elsewhere, perhaps in exchange for other goods and services or as gifts and markers of status.261 Neopalatial art must have therefore reflected the contemporary value system of these centers, providing images which the elite in power used to promote itself.262 As in the Near East and Egypt, these display items consisted mostly of rich, miniature, and portable art objects. Many of these were stored and brought out when needed.263 In the west wing at Zakros, rooms 253 BCH 118 (1994) 822; AR 42 (1996) 45; and ArchDelt 45 (1990) 429-30. 254 J.G.

In ad- dition to a stone relief rhyton fragment showing men carrying stone ladles, ring impressions depict women and men carrying poles, double axes, fabrics, and vessels in procession. It is significant that, outside the peak sanctuaries, very few fixed areas for social or religious ritual have been identified for the Neo- palatial era. Presumably, these portable objects were displayed in other formal settings, like courts and in processions. These prestige objects are widely distributed. For instance, an ornamental stone mace, a stone rhyton, palatial pottery, and sealed documents impressed by gold look-alike rings (see below) were sent to the country house at Sklavokambos on the main route leading from Knossos to Mt. Ida; the villa at Pyrgos received imported Egyptian stone vases and a mold- made triton shell of pink faience; the court-centered building at Makriyialos obtained a stone chalice and Marine Style pottery; and, on stylistic grounds, Pa- laikastro may have received its ivory youth and the Zakros palace its Sanctuary Rhyton from workshops at Knossos. Ayia Triada is particularly rich in pres- tige objects probably manufactured at Knossos: the Boxer Rhyton has scenes of bull sports and sinewy human figures that seem particularly Knossian. These objects found scattered across the island suggest a system of exchange by which these centers are tied into a palatial prestige system that reflects a network not just of political ties to Knossos, but also of artistic techniques, iconography, and religious beliefs and symbolic practices, most of which seem to emanate from Knossos. As a leader and innovator in artistic production, Knossos was surely the most important Neopalatial center in Crete. The central court and west court of the palace are the largest on Crete, and would have provided gathering spaces for hundreds of individ- uals at a single time. The west wing, with its long storage magazines lined with large pithoi, was the main supply center for the palace.265 The remainder of the west wing housed ceremonial rooms includ- ing the only undisputed throne room on Crete, pil- lar basements, and the so-called Temple Reposito- ries. Over all these, an upper floor that Evans called the "piano nobile" has been reconstructed, the rooms of which were decorated with frescoes. Extensive ter- racing on the east side of the palace supported the Great East Hall at the level of the central court, and south of it the Grand Staircase led to the "Domestic Quarter," a misnomer since its stone drains and polythyra indicate ceremonial rather than living areas.266 Recently, several scholars have suggested that Neo- palatial Knossos may have been most important as a ritual center.267 In support of this hypothesis are the lack of identifiable deposits of domestic pottery of Neopalatial date (although these are common in many of the houses outside the palace) and the pres- ence of LM IA pottery choking the drains of the east wing. The Phaistos palace similarly shows few signs of actual human occupation in the final phase of the Neopalatial period. Knossos is the only palace with both large-scale and miniature frescoes depicting the human form; the large-scale figures are sometimes executed in re- lief. As noted earlier, these frescoes emphasize im- portant women, gatherings of women and men, phys- ical combat among athletic youths, bull-leaping with adolescent youths and maidens as participants, and the architecture of palatial buildings and peak sanc- tuaries. Several of these topoi were also carved on gold rings carried by top administrators and on stone relief rhyta. The repetition of a few select images in a variety of media suggests that the Neopalatial elite wanted to project these images to the rest of the population. The pictorial programs of the ma- jor entrances to the palace deserve emphasis, since here stood bull and procession scenes that con- fronted all visitors to the complex. These pictorial themes suggest that the palace had three important functions. First, it was a setting for ritual activities involving women and men, perhaps on a seasonal basis or according to a religious cal- endar. Second, the depiction of supernatural crea- tures like griffins or sphinxes may indicate that the palace was considered a liminal zone where the real and supernatural worlds intersected.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Knossos seems to have been a major center on Crete for the performance of bull-leaping and related ac- tivities, and these events may have been central to the identity of the palace.268 The dissemination of Knossian iconography and artistic techniques to other Minoan sites, especially toward the end of the Neopalatial period, appears to be part of a delib- erate scheme. Writing and Administration Sealing administration began in the Near East in the sixth millennium B.C. followed by writing ca. 3100, but it is unlikely that Crete had administrative sys- tems before the beginning of the MM period. An administration at Knossos may have been using seal- ings in the Prepalatial period, in MM I, but the prac- tice becomes widespread in Crete only in MM 11.269 Cretan Hieroglyphic writing makes a first appear- ance in MM IA, shortly before the rise of the first palaces.270 Although the Hieroglyphic script dies out at the beginning of the Neopalatial period,27' its genesis is important because it is the first Aegean linear script and with it we see the beginning of ad- ministrative practices that will remain fairly constant throughout the Neo- and Final Palatial periods. Linear A develops in MM IIA and is the major writing system on Crete throughout the Neopalatial period; it does not survive this period long, if at all.272 Because Hieroglyphic and Linear A seem to share some signs, it is probable that Linear A de- rives in part from Hieroglyphic, though that does not necessarily imply that they represent the same language. Nevertheless, a number of sites use both Hieroglyphic and Linear A (Phaistos, Knossos, Mal- lia, Petras), and in MM II-IIIA Knossos was appar- ently using both contemporaneously. The develop- ment of Linear B out of A is probable and may have occurred at Knossos prior to the end of the Neo- palatial period or soon after.273 As a script and ad- ministrative tool, Linear B is considered below un- der "Final Palatial Administration." Cypro-Minoan, which lies outside the scope of this review, seems to have developed in large measure from Linear A as well.274 268 Younger (supra n. 254); Hallager and Hallager (supra n. 113); Rehak (supra ns. 132-33). 269 Hallager I, 21-25; J.

Hiero- glyphic uses 96 syllabograms, 34 logograms, nine fractions, and a few other signs as adjuncts and punctuations. CHIC catalogues a corpus of 331 Hieroglyphic inscriptions, the majority of which are seals or seal impressions. The script is basically pictographic (CHIC 19). Within the Protopala- tial period, there is at least one other script, that which appears on the Phaistos Disc; the inscription on the Ar- kalochori ax is similar, but perhaps distinct: Godart (supra n. 223);J.-P.

The bulk of Linear A documents comes from MM III and LM I contexts.276 The three Linear A doc- uments from Phaistos that may also date to the Neo- palatial period may imply that Phaistos was oper- ating administratively at that time.277 There are four types of Linear A clay documents (fig. 5): tablets, roundels, nodules, and noduli. A dis- tinction is usually made between inscribed (written) documents and those that are impressed by seals. Tablets are never impressed, while nodules may, or may not, be impressed and/or inscribed. Most Linear A tablets are page-shaped with the inscription ranked in rows, and all carry lists of commodities and personnel.278 Two types of monumental or conventional for- mulae are known, the "Libation Formula" and ap- parent gibberish, and these do not occur on tablets. The gibberish consists of several long inscriptions, usually not separated into word groups, on three gold hairpins, a bronze bowl, and a gold finger-ring; for the most part, except for the 'JA-SA-SA-RA" on PL Zf 1, they are hapax legomena.279 In full, the Liba- tion Formula consists of a phrase or sentence of eight words inscribed on a wide variety of objects, stone libation tables, cups, ladles and altars, inked terra- cotta cups, and a silver pin, most of which were ded- icated at peak sanctuaries.280 In its full form, and in Linear B values, the Libation Formula is as fol- lows: 1) T/A-TA-I-*301-; 2) word; 3) word; 4) J/A-SA- SA-RA; 5) U-NA-KA-NA-SI; 6) I-PI-NA-MA; 7) SI-RU- TE; and 8) I-NA-JA-PA-QA. The wordJ/A-SA-SA-RA has usually been assumed to be the name of a goddess allied with the Semitic Astarte/Asshra.28' The final four words from U-NA- KA-NA-SI to I-NA-JA-PA-QA do not change. The first word T/A-TA-I-*301- appears in many variations that are difficult to resolve. Word 3 is always different, perhaps the name of the dedicant. The second word is often A-DI-KITE (or some variant) or I-DA (or some variant); six other words appear in this slot, includ- ing TU-RU-SA and SE-TO-I-JA. Since the last two are toponyms representing Tylissos and perhaps either Mallia or Archanes,282 and since A-DI-KI-TE and I- DA look like the mountains Dikte and Ida, this slot in the Libation Formula appears reserved for a toponym. Clay documents other than tablets can also be impressed and come in a wide range of shapes: documents that were not attached to anything (in- dependent documents), documents that were pressed against something (direct-object sealings), and doc- uments that hung from a cord (nodules or hanging nodules). The Linear A roundel is a clay, disk-shaped in- dependent document that could be written on one or both faces and/or impressed along the rim. As receipts for objects leaving the administrative cen- ters, they record a word on one side, the ideogram for the commodity on the other, and on the rim a number of impressions of seals, presumably be- 275 Linear A and B share 80 signs, both syllabograms and logograms, with four signs as variants unique to Linear A. In addition, like Linear B, Linear A has a long list of unique signs that appear rarely, only in conjunction with some other sign, or only as hapax legomena; 18 signs func- tion as ideograms for vases; 154 ligatures serve as short- hand notations of commodities; and 13 simple and 30 com- plex fractions attest to a still baffling but precise measuring system. GORILA catalogues 1,487 inscriptions, almost all inscribed: 323 tablets, 887 nodules, 7 noduli, 178 roun- dels, 34 inscribed vessels, 3 graffito inscriptions in plaster, 2 inscriptions on architectural blocks, 8 inscriptions on metal objects (including a bowl, hairpins, and a gold ring), and 5 inscriptions on miscellaneous objects; 37 inscriptions were painted on vessels. 276 Site summaries in Hallager I, 39-77; add Thera: AR 40 (1994) 69; Ergon 41 (1994) 56-62.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 longing to the parties involved, that correspond to the number or amount of the commodities dis- pensed.283 Another independent document, the nod- ulus, is a lump of clay impressed by a seal and only rarely also inscribed; noduli may have served as dock- ets, "obligations to pay workers."284 Other classes of small, lumpy clay documents were perforated, written on, and/or impressed. Most schol- ars give them the generic term "sealings" or "nod- ules." Sealings, as the term implies, however, seal ob- jects directly- chests, boxes, jars, pegs (chest doors, storeroom doors?), and leather documents.285 Nod- ules secure the ends of string and hang from objects; they come in two forms, those into which the string entered at only one end (one-hole nodules) and those into which string entered at both ends (two- hole nodules). One-hole nodules are thought to have occurred in pairs, each securing one of the two ends of a single piece of string that perhaps tied up pa- pyrus documents.286 Two-hole nodules sealed the knot that ties together the two ends of one string, which was probably looped about an object. The Protopalatial use of direct-object sealings (pegs and jars) continues selectively into the Neo- palatial period. In the late Protopalatial period, how- ever, an entirely new set of clay documents is intro- duced for both Hieroglyphic and Linear A: tablets and noduli, one-hole and two-hole hanging nodules, and document sealings.287 Briefly, an administration uses a sealing system to monitor the reception, storage, distribution, and inventory of goods.288 Tokens may represent the en- try of goods into the storerooms. The goods may be placed in containers sealed with an impressed seal- ing, have an impressed nodule hanging from them, or simply be left in a magazine whose door is tied closed with string and sealed with an impressed seal- ing. The clay sealings on the containers or on the doors constitute a "living archive." Withdrawals should be of a standardized quantity, represented by the broken sealing or detached nod- ule that is reserved; the reserved nodules and seal- ings comprise a "temporary archive." At the end of the accounting period, the reserved nodules are brought together as a "final archive," like that at Pylos, and are counted and subtracted from the orig- inal amount. The total is then matched against the remaining amount of the commodity. Audited seal- ings are then discarded (a "discard archive") where they cannot be reinserted into the next administra- tive period to falsify later accounts. Favorite places for discarding sealings in the Neopalatial period are in closets under stairs; they are also used as fill in abandoned rooms or spaces, and in blocking walls. To be preserved, all clay documents need to be baked in a fire; since there is no evidence for any delib- erate firing of documents, as exists in the Near East, all documents from Crete were fired in conflagra- tions, whether accidental or deliberate. Living archives from Necpalatial Crete are rare, but several temporary archives have been excavated (e.g., the sealings in House A, Zakros), and one final archive of Linear A documents may survive from Chania, Odos Katre.289 Most impressed sealings, 283 Hallager; P.

In fact, the scat- ter of Linear A and B documents throughout the Knossos palace and the lack of any identifiable cen- tral archive strongly suggest that many of these de- posits represent discard archives. This hypothesis has considerable consequences for the interpreta- tion of the final destruction of Knossos, considered below under "Final Palatial Administration" There are two major ways to analyze the patterns of seal use on impressed documents. One is to de- termine the frequency or "intensity" of a single seal's use within a deposit. When seals are used only a few times each to impress documents, it may imply, for instance, that members of the rural populace were sending their individual contracts or contributions to the central administration. When a few seals are used many times to impress documents, it may reflect an internal administration with a limited number of palace bureaucrats sealing and unsealing com- modities and storerooms many times over the course of an administrative period. A document can be im- pressed several times by one seal (Weingarten's Sin- gle Seal System, or SSS) or by two or more seals in combination (the Multiple Seal System, or MSS).290 The SSS presumably involves a single person respon- sible for impressing a document, while the MSS re- quires two or more people to authenticate or ad- minister a document together. The two systems can be found at the same site.291 Such analyses allow us to envision in some detail a Neopalatial administra- tion's concern with incoming goods from the outly- ing areas and with the internal management of these goods. In the debate over whether these Neopalatial sites, including Knossos, were palatial or domanial in character, deposits like those at Zakros, where the MSS dominates, seem to reflect the management of an estate rather than a state-management.292 While some classes of impressed documents ap- pear in virtually every sealing deposit in Crete, others appear to be restricted to individual sites: one-hole hanging nodules, for instance, are so characteristic ofAyia Triada that the few found at Zakros may imply some communication, perhaps written on papyrus, from Ayia Triada.293 Numerous seals carry almost identical scenes and can be distinguished from each other only with difficulty; they may have belonged to administrators who functioned similarly.294 Several of these "look- alikes" were gold rings with bull-leaping scenes, used to impress documents found at numerous sites. For example, one of these rings impressed three leather document sealings found at Ayia Triada, two doc- ument sealings from Sklavokambos, and two nod- uli, one from Gournia and one from the Zakros pal- ace. It may be that the administrators traveled, or, more likely, impressed the documents at one regional center and sent them out to others. If the gold rings belonged to an elite administration at Knossos, the leather documents may have concerned sociopolit- ical and ceremonial (perhaps ritual or religious) issues.295 It is usually assumed that the pre-Classical lan- guage of Crete was not Greek. Ancient writers de- scribe the Cretans as sui generis. Eteo-Cretans and Pelasgikoi lived in eastern Crete in Classical times; and, as if to confirm the presence of non-Greek speak- ers, Classical and Hellenistic inscriptions have been recovered from East Crete, written with Greek let- ters but reflecting a non-Greek language.296 It is a common practice, called "normalizing;' to 29o Weingarten (supra n. 107) and Weingarten 1988 (supra n. 269). Some caution needs to be exercised when translating seal use into personnel, however. Tomb evidence demonstrates that a single individual could own more than one seal (I. Pini, CMS V, Suppl. lA, xviii), and it can be shown that the several faces of a single multifacial seal could impress a single document (e.g., Knossos Wc 41, Hallager II, 166-67; Samothrace Wc 2, Hallager II, 200-201). Thus, not all MSS documents need to have been impressed by two or more people. 291 Of the approximately 525 nodules in House A at Zakros, 360 (69%) were MSS documents impressed by two or three seal faces, while 165 (31%) were SSS documents impressed by one seal face only. The SSS seals belonged to the Cretan Popular group, common throughout the is- land, and perhaps reflecting a rural population; the MSS seals, however, belonged to the so-called "Zakro Master" group, distinctive of Zakros, perhaps belonging to mem- bers of the administration; Weingarten 1988 (supra n. 269) 46. 292 Weingarten 1988 (supra n. 269) 16 n. 15, citingJ.

(supra n. 269) 307-30 argues for a greater administrative purview; he estimates Ayia Triada's agricultural territory as about 830 ha. This amount of land would fit comfortably in the immediate area, between the Geropotamos River and the western foothills of the As- terousia Mountains, and would resemble the territories of other and similar regional centers: P Rehak and J.G.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 assign Linear B phonetic values to similar-looking Linear A signs for convenience.297 When normal- ized, Linear A reveals some similarities to Linear B: a few Linear A words can be recognized in Linear B, including toponyms, and many of the ideograms seem the same. It is also likely that the unit of ca- pacity in Linear A was the same as that in Linear B, 28.8 liters.298 Linear A, however, exhibits a sig- nificantly reduced o-series (in Linear A, no DO, JO, MO, NO, QO, SO) and the apparent tendency to use a final -u where Linear B uses final -o. There are too few Linear A documents to give any complete sense of grammar, but the repetitions of word stems with varied endings within the Libation Formula suggest some inflections.299 As for vocab- ulary, it is certain from their context that KU-RO means "total" and PO-TO-KU-RO means "grand to- tal"; KI-KI-NA might mean "fig(s), and TA-RA should mean "five"O300 In addition to the identification of the AB ideograms, special Linear A ideogram *A302 may signify olive oil and *A303 grain. Several languages have been proposed for Linear A based on resemblances in vocabulary: Semitic, especially East Semitic, and some Indo-European lan- guages like Greek, Luvian (a southwestern Anatolian dialect of Hittite), and Lycian.301 Of these proposals, Semitic and Luvian are attractive for historical rea- sons: Semitic because of the evidence of trade con- nections between Crete and the eastern Mediterra- nean, and Luvian because of the close ceramic connections between southwestern Anatolia and Crete, especially in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. It should be remembered, however, that lexical resemblances do not specify a language; grammar and syntax do, and too little of either is known se- curely for Linear A. Trade and Interconnections Closely tied to issues of production, exchange, and administration within Crete during the Neopalatial period are questions concerning the nature of Mi- noan trade and interconnections with other cultures of the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean. Much work has been done in this area, with several inter- national conferences in the last 15 years devoted en- tirely to aspects of the subject.302 Although the most attention continues to be paid to pottery (both im- ported and exported)303 and to metals, especially copper and tin, recent interest has concentrated on Neopalatial Crete's contacts with all surrounding areas, both within and outside the Aegean, and on the cultural correlates that accompany such contact. The origins of Neopalatial trade must be sought in the Protopalatial period.304 MM II pottery has been found at many sites in the Cyclades, and espe- cially the island of Aegina, Cyprus and the eastern 297 In only a few cases can it be demonstrated that the same word or its derivative appears in both Linear A and B, and from these only 12-15 Linear A signs can be assigned Linear B phonetic values with any confidence (DA, I, JA, KI, PA, PI, RO, RI, SE, SU, TA, 0, and possibly TE, A, KO): L.

But the primary focus of Minoan interest in Anatolia and Syria in both the Protopalatial and Neo- palatial periods is likely to have centered on the metals trade, particularly tin.308 If so, the evidence for Protopalatial contact with Cyprus, and Cypriot copper, seems slight, while Middle Cypriot II sherds have been found at Zakros and Mallia in early Neo- palatial levels, and some White-Painted Cross Line pottery occurs at Kommos.3o9 In LM I, however, there is a veritable wave of im- ported pottery. Much Cycladic pottery, especially from Thera, is imported into East Crete and to Kom- mos, which also receives some imported Mycenaean wares, while Central Cretan pots are exported to Thera. LM I also sees the most contact between Crete and Cyprus: Cypriot pottery is imported in some quantity, and much LM IA and B pottery is exported to Cyprus. Contact between the Levant and Crete intensifies in LM I.31S Although there is a minimum of Anatolian and Egyptian wares in Crete, a number of Canaanite amphoras attest to contact with the Le- vant, and LM I pottery is found throughout the Near East.311 In this regard it is difficult to know how to assess the evidence from pottery. We cannot assume, for instance, that the presence of a pot implies the pres- ence of the people that produced it.312 Recent sci- entific analysis has shown that much of the pottery considered Minoan was actually locally produced. Raw bulk goods such as metal ingots can also be difficult to trace because, as already smelted copper, they were redistributed and reworked, and perish- able goods like foods and textiles have left few traces in Aegean contexts. The durable materials may sim- ply be the surviving visible markers of a much more extensive trade in other goods.313 The wide range of the preserved contents of the Uluburun shipwreck has completely changed the way we imagine ancient trade.314 In 1980, Catling formulated his well-known par- adox: in the Neopalatial period, there is much bronze in the Aegean, but little evidence for contact between the Aegean and Cyprus; in the Final Palatial period, the situation is reversed, with little Cypriot copper in the Aegean, but much Aegean pottery in Cy- 305 Kythera: Sakellarakis (supra n. 213); Coldstream and Huxley (supra n. 189); I.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 prus.315 Although more LM I pottery is now known from Cyprus, the copper at most Neopalatial sites still cannot be shown to come from Cypriot sources, and may instead be from Lavrion.316 The puzzle re- mains: if Minoans were not importing Cypriot cop- per to Crete in the Neopalatial period, why is their pottery found on Cyprus?317 In the Neopalatial period, there were at least three major Minoan trade routes within the Aegean: from Crete to Kythera, Laconia, and southwestern Mes- senia; the "Western String" of the Cyclades through Thera, Melos, and Kea, to the copper and silver mines at Lavrion; and the "Eastern String" through the Do- decanese to Anatolia and beyond.318 Crete was con- nected to the central and eastern Mediterranean largely through a single latitudinal route that con- nected the two regions but which ran along the north coast of Crete going east and along the south coast going west.319 From the east, the route proceeded counterclockwise up the Levantine coast, past Cy- prus and the coast of Anatolia, through the straits of Rhodes to Karpathos, and south to Crete's Cape Sidero. Ships might then travel west along the north coast to enter the Gulf of Mirambello, but apparently the major route called for them to turn south to Zak- ros and Kommos, from where they could continue west or, taking advantage of prevailing winds and currents, head south across the Libyan Sea. The route from the west would have reached Crete at Chania, continuing along the north coast to Knossos. According to these models for the principal trade routes, Minoans would have come into contact with the peoples of the western and eastern Mediterra- nean primarily in the various harbors and emporia along the routes themselves, and with the Mycenae- ans directly in the southern Peloponnese and in- directly in the Cyclades, primarily on Thera and Melos.320 It is unlikely, however, that Minoan trade and contact with all these areas remained unchang- ing throughout the Neopalatial period. While trade with Cyprus apparently remains relatively steady from MM into Postpalatial times, contact with Syria seems to quicken in LM I and with Italy and Sar- dinia at the end of the Final Palatial period. Trade, which may originate in part from a desire of local elites to obtain certain goods, can be con- sidered from a number of different viewpoints: so- ciety, politics, technology, and distance.321 Four models seem particularly useful in assessing the mul- tiple functions of trade: centralized control, local- ized control, independent or entrepreneurial trade, and ceremonial or gift exchange.322 The first as- sumes that trade was organized by a central author- ity, like the legendary thalassocracy of King Minos, for which there is very little concrete evidence. A model of localized control assumes the existence of "gateway" communities as a conduit for the transfer of commodities (especially metals) and finished prod- ucts to subsidiary centers.323 Independent or entre- preneurial trade models assume that some traders coexisted alongside merchants controlled or admin- istered by the state. Finally, ceremonial or gift ex- change may involve aspects of the other models, since its principal aim is not to gain a material advantage but rather to create stable relations and establish social ranking. This last function is a particularly important aspect of chiefdoms.324 The nature of the relationship between Crete and the Aegean islands in the Neopalatial period de- mands some explanation and characterization. Crete may have been primarily interested in the copper and silver deposits at Lavrion. By LM IB, both Mi- noans and Mycenaeans were present at Ayia Irini in Kea, where much of the working of the Lavrion 315 Knapp (supra n. 207). 16 Knapp (supra n. 207) 57.

For the making of bronze, now- ever, Crete may have been the sole possessor of tin. receiving it from the east. Such a monopoly might have created tensions. If Akrotiri was the mutual em- porion for both Cretan and mainland trade,325 the eruption of the island might have caused a signifi- cant disruption in Crete's access to Lavrion and the mainland's access to Minoan bronze. Since we do not know who the rulers in Neopa- latial Crete were, we do not know how centralized the Minoan trade with the Cyclades was.326 Propo- nents of a thalassocracy ruled by Minos have based their argument on anachronistic sources like Thucy- dides, who was attempting to justify the Athenian imperialism of his own day, or on the distribution of Aegean sites named Minoa and the mythological stories that record the conquests of Minos.327 A natural corollary to the notion of a Minoan thal- assocracy is the suggestion by Diodorus Siculus (5.54.4) that the Cretans established colonies on sev- eral Aegean islands.328 Evans had even postulated that Minoan settlers on the mainland were respon- sible for the rise of Mycenaean civilization, a theory that is now largely discounted.329 Since there are many types of colonies in addition to the Classical Greek model,330 including trading and agricultural colonies, scholars need to make their definitions clear. Another important aspect to be considered is that colonization always involves the development of ethnic identities that both the motherland and the colony share yet make distinct. Several Aegean sites have been proposed as Mi- noan colonies because they exhibit Minoan domes- tic pottery (imported and locally made), evidence for Minoan cult, the use of Minoan burial customs, and Minoan architectural and decorative styles: Kyth- era, Ialysos and Trianda on Rhodes, Seraglio on Kos, and Miletos.33' It should be stressed, however, that these excavations are quite small, sometimes not much more than a few trenches, and generalizations should be offered cautiously. By contrast, the exten- sively excavated and heavily Minoanized sites of Phy- lakopi, Akrotiri, and Ayia Irini are generally not con- sidered colonies. Sometimes included in discussions of a possible Cretan thalassocracy is the imitation outside Crete of Minoan building styles, pottery, and art without imputing Minoan political and military control, called the "Versailles effect" after the tendency to im- itate court styles at Versailles in areas of Europe out- side French political control.332 Similarly, Linear A may have served as a common script for business purposes outside Crete without indicating political domination by the Minoans,just as English and Ger- man are widely used in international business trans- actions today.333 325 The relatively higher incidence of Cycladic, as op- posed to Minoan, pottery in the Mycenae Shaft Graves (J. Rutter, AJA 97 [1993] 791-93) suggests that until the end of LM IA, much trade with the mainland may have been in the hands of Cycladic islanders. M. Marthari, "The Ce- ramic Evidence for Contacts between Thera and the Greek Mainland," in Zerner and Zerner (supra n. 302) 249-56 notes that of the pottery at Thera, 85% is local and 15% imported, of which less than 2% is from the mainland.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 We can see clear architectural indications of the Versailles effect: polythyra at Akrotiri and Trianda; a lustral basin, light well, and ashlar architecture at Akrotiri; a pillar basement at Phylakopi; and a Minoan-style "parlor" in House A at Ayia Irini. On the mainland, one tholos at Peristeria has an ashlar facade with Minoan-style mason's marks, and simi- lar blocks have been found reused at Pylos, Myce- nae, and Colonna on Aegina.334 Another model to account for the spread of Mi- noan Neopalatial culture in the Aegean is the sug- gestion that it had a religious underpinning.335 Later history provides well-documented examples for religion-based models of exchange, especially in "contact periods;' where technological exchanges were tied (often unsuccessfully) to the adoption of religious beliefs (e.g., European contacts with Native American populations or with the Aborigines in Aus- tralia); a careful reading of such examples for the Aegean might give the necessary grounding for a sys- tematic argument for a Minoan "threskeiocracy''336 Certainly the physical evidence exists for a per- suasive prima facie argument. Peak and cave sanc- tuaries of Minoan type can be postulated for Thera, Kea, the Vathy Cave on Kalymnos, and Apollo Ma- leatas at Epidauros, while an actual example of a Minoan peak sanctuary has now been excavated on Kythera.337 From the peak on Kythera, it is possible to see the peak of Mt. Ida on Crete, and other line- of-sight networks may have existed from Kea to Thera, and from there to Crete. Minoan religious themes appear in frescoes outside Crete, and Minoan- inspired terracotta statues were excavated at the temple at Ayia Irini on Kea. Many sites outside Crete have yielded Minoan cult equipment, including horns of consecration and offering tables, as well as prestige items like bull's head rhyta, maces, real or imitation tritons, and "game-boards"338 Exported stone chalices reflect Minoan wine-drinking ritu- als;339 compare the Tiryns ring (CMS I, no. 179) that depicts the enthroned goddess holding a chalice and attended by a file of genii with pitchers.

Most of these objects in the Cyclades are found in habitation sites, however, while most of those on the mainland have been found in tombs. It is possible, therefore, that the Myce- naeans regarded Minoan religious items merely as prestige goods, and their possession as an indicator of status. The second model, that of localized control, pos- its the existence of gateway communities from which raw materials and finished goods were sent on to subsidiary centers. Zakros is an obvious gateway with its hoard of unworked elephant tusks and metal in- gots; in the Final Palatial period, Kommos seems to have fulfilled a similar function. Port towns such as Kythera, Akrotiri, and Poros Herakleion are likely places for different ethnic groups to have mixed. The contents of the rich tombs at Poros suggest that they served individuals with international connections. Thus, it is not impossible that some Mycenaeans were already present on Crete in LM IA. If so, were they sightseers, businessmen, mercenaries, or envoys? It also might be useful to coin a new term for some of these individuals, perhaps "warrior trader" or "mer- chant prince."341 A third model of independent or entrepreneur- ial trade has been used to suggest that private mer- chants existed alongside royal merchants. This may be assumed for Crete, if only because it can be doc- umented even for the strongly centralized royal au- thorities of the eastern Mediterranean.342 The fourth model, ceremonial or gift exchange among rulers, is implied by some objects. For exam- ple, at least 25 statuettes of Middle Kingdom Egyp- tian envoys of the pharaohs are attested from Ana- tolia to Nubia; the stone figure of User found at Knossos in a chronologically problematic context must be one such figure.343 The reciprocal nature of such exchanges is indicated by the Levantine- Aegean silver cups deposited at T6d in southern Egypt.344 The stone lid inscribed with the name of the Hyksos pharaoh Khyan, again from a controver- sial context at Knossos, also fits into this pattern, for other objects inscribed by this ruler have been found in Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.345 An- other possible example of gift exchange is the pres- ence of African blue monkeys or vervets (cercopithe- cus aethiops aethiops) in Knossian wall paintings, where they appear in ritual scenes; their importance must have been enhanced by their exotic quality. From Knossos, some of these monkeys may then have been shipped to Minoanized sites such as Akrotiri and Phyl- akopi, where they again appear in wall paintings.346 A variant of the "gift exchange" model is the Mi- noan or Minoanizing artistic koine in the Aegean, elements of which we recounted above. This koine consisted of geographically widespread similarities in special objects, techniques, iconography, and style, often so uniform that it is sometimes extremely difficult to separate Minoan from Mycenaean from Cycladic art; to some extent this Aegean koine is part of a larger common culture within the eastern Med- ~40 Late Protopalatial sealings: a peg sealing from Ayia Irini in Kea (CMS V, no. 479); and two cord sealings, two impressed noduli (one inscribed with NA-TA), and an im- pressed roundel from Samothrace (CMS V, Suppl. IB, nos. 320-28). Neopalatial document sealings are now reported from Thera (Ergon 42 [1995] 52-54, figs. 37-38) impressed by rings depicting bull-leaping and a chariot, the latter duplicated on similar sealings from Ayia Triada (HMs 516; PM IV, fig. 808) and Sklavokambos (HMs 632-35). 341 The later Lefkandi burial resembles both the Poros burials and the Vapheio prince: M.R.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 iterranean.34 7 Three technological innovations in the Aegean are probably the result of Syrian influ- ence: cloisonne, granulation, and the niello technique of inlaying different colors of metal against a black background. The ceremonial ax of the Egyptian queen Aahotep employs the niello technique and in- cludes the representation of a distinctively Aegean crested griffin.348 At the Syrian site of Kabri, floor and wall paintings in Minoan fresco technique have been uncovered, and other fresco fragments with Minoan elements have been identified in the dec- oration of the palace of Yarim Lin at Alalakh (level VII), well inland from Ugarit, and in the palace of Zimri Lim at Mari on the Upper Euphrates.349 The recent discovery at Tell el-Dab'a in the Nile Delta of paintings in Minoan fresco technique and employ- ing a strongly Minoanizing iconography has been much discussed.350 Whether these paintings are to be dated to late in the Hyksos period or to the early 18th Dynasty (as now seems more likely), they should be contemporary with the end of the Neopalatial period (LM IB). The scenes published thus far are strongly suggestive of Knossian influence: the tech- nique of fresco, the use of colored backgrounds, the iconography of bull-leaping, and bulls, griffins, and a leopard in flying gallop. Nonetheless, some aspects suggest an unfamiliarity with the details of Minoan iconography.35' So far, there have been many inter- pretations of the meaning of these frescoes, but more likely than not they are simply symptomatic of an international cultural sophistication in the larger eastern Mediterranean. Like African blue monkeys in the Aegean, Minoan frescoes in the Levant and Egypt may have been of interest primarily because they were exotic. While most studies of trade have concentrated on items that originate in one place and are found in another, we wish to point out one unusual pattern in Neopalatial trade: three items not found in Crete. One of the most obvious is the object decorated in niello. Virtually all Aegean niello work has been found in early and rich Mycenaean tombs on the mainland, but the iconography of these objects is strongly Minoan. Nonetheless, articles also in this technique come from Syria-Palestine and Egypt, and it seems likely that the technique originates in Syria. While it is difficult to imagine any Aegean work- shop outside Knossos capable of producing them, Laffineur has intriguingly proposed a workshop at Mycenae staffed by Syrian craftsmen.352 Two materials are also found almost exclusively on the mainland: amber and amethyst. Most of the amber in the Aegean is of Baltic origin, and large quantities of it have been found in mainland con- texts in LH I-IIA, but almost none is found from that period in the Cyclades or on Crete.353 There- after, the amounts declined markedly, as if little more was coming into the Aegean, and the existing supply was simply being redistributed; even then, little reached Crete. Amethyst, on the other hand, prob- ably came from Egypt and into the Aegean via the eastern Mediterranean, perhaps in exchange for sil- ver from Lavrion. Like amber, amethyst is found in quantity in early LBA funerary contexts on the main- land. Only a few amethyst beads and seals occur in Neopalatial Cretan contexts, however, and from LHILM IIIA1 on, little amethyst is recorded anywhere in the Aegean.354 These items possibly point to three peculiarities in Aegean trade networks: a set of foreign craftsmen 347 E.g., R.

In these three instances, Crete is a "present absence" that demands an explanation. Religion We know a great deal about Minoan cult locations and equipment, and practically nothing about belief systems for the Neopalatial period.355 Since Linear B makes available religious documents pertaining to the Final Palatial period, it is possible that a decipherment of Linear A or Hieroglyphic might provide some help, but the obviously religious texts are few and conventional, as noted above.356 The groundwork for the study of Minoan religion was laid at the beginning of the 20th century by Evans; his influence has been enormous and his views are still too often accepted uncritically, particularly his belief in a Great Mother Goddess and her Young Male Consort. Nearly half a century ago, Nilsson was unable to distinguish between Minoan and Myce- naean religion.357 Efforts in the last two decades have concentrated on identifying and separating the contributions of the two cultures. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done. As in so many other areas, the origins of Neopa- latial religion must be sought in the Protopalatial period. Even before the rise of the first palaces, the Minoans were making offerings, perhaps on a sea- sonal basis, at caves throughout the island and at sanctuaries on mountain peaks and mountainsides, such as Juktas near Knossos and Kato Syme on the south coast. Monumental architecture, as well as Hieroglyphic script for religious administration, ap- pears at some of these locations prior to the appear- ance of the first palaces. Equally early are the com- munal tholos tombs, especially in the Mesara, which were used by extended families or communities for burials and for the veneration of their ancestors. Finally, with the appearance of the first palaces, small ritual rooms with equipment for the preparation of drink and food can be identified at habitation sites, along with other possible cult paraphernalia. It is not clear, however, that there was a unified set of cult practices or beliefs across Crete even in Protopala- tial times, though the sporadic appearance of images of women has led some to hypothesize the existence of a major Minoan goddess.358 The figurines at peak sanctuaries, however, include both men and women, with the former outnumbering the latter. At the beginning of the Neopalatial period, fewer peak and mountain sanctuaries remain in use but some now receive palatial dedications.359 Evidence for burial ritual and the burials themselves virtually ceases, while at the palaces and major centers cult equipment becomes much richer and more complex, and Linear A supersedes Hieroglyphic.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 tors suggest that the new palaces may have engaged deliberately in reorganizing and reforming Minoan religion along official lines. With the LM IB destruc- tions that signal the end of the Neopalatial period, many forms of cult equipment connected with the palaces and major centers disappear, along with Linear A, and tombs reemerge as focal points for funerary cult, indicating that in some way the de- structions mark a rejection of the Neopalatial reli- gious system and a reemergence of long-held be- liefs and customs. Historical parallels suggest that throughout the Neopalatial period, popular cults probably existed outside of palatial control along- side official cults. The peak sanctuary on Juktas, in use in Proto- palatial times, had its first major building program in MM II-III when megalithic terraces I and II were established around an altar used for burning, adja- cent to a natural cleft into which debris was swept.360 Several offering tables or kernoi have been found built into the altar and set alongside the area of burn- ing. A series of small subsidiary rooms was built against the slope on the east. After a MM III destruc- tion, the sanctuary was reorganized and blocking walls subdivided the subsidiary rooms I-V, reusing poros blocks and a column base from the earlier phase. Neopalatial finds included stone offering tables and vessels, a fragment of a painted terracotta house model, anthropomorphic figurines, sheet bronze votive tools, scraps of gold foil, and sealstones. The open terraced areas and their formal approach ramp should be considered an example of a "sacred enclosure," not a temple or a tripartite shrine. A mega- lithic circuit wall enclosing the peak might be as early as MM III/LM I or as late as LM III. Juktas was approached by at least one Minoan road from Knossos to the north. Along this route, just be- low the peak and outside the circuit wall, lay Build- ingB, begun late in Protopalatial times (MM IIB-MM IIIA) and rebuilt along more impressive lines at the beginning of Neopalatial times (MM IIIA-B). Each phase ended in a destruction by fire. Because many of the finds are of a practical nature (e.g., a stone water channel, a pottery workshop), this building may have served the sanctuary as a way station and man- ufactory for votive items. Lower still and farther north along this route is the shrine building at Anemospilia,361 perhaps an- other station on the road up toJuktas. This building collapsed in an earthquake in MM IIIA, followed by fire, entombing four individuals; forensic reconstruc- tion of their faces provides important new evidence about Minoan physiognomy. There is no real evidence that human sacrifice was taking place here, although the recently discovered children's bones at Knossos in a LM IB context have been interpreted as evidence for ritual cannibalism.362 A mountainside (but not peak) sanctuary at Kato Syme forms an important comparison toJuktas, but unlike it, Syme seems to have existed outside any one direct palatial authority and to have served more than one geographic region.363 Located at an eleva- tion of 1,200 masl in a natural concavity at the foot of a cliff on the south slope of Mt. Dikte, Syme's set- ting is reminiscent of that of Delphi. Integral features of the site were a perennial gushing spring of ice- cold water and a waterfall, both of which probably attracted the attention of the Minoans. Because of its relative inaccessibility, Syme can only have been used on a seasonal basis, and even now the site is inaccessible in winter. Minoan visitors from Central Crete probably took an overland "pilgrimage" route from the Mesara and Pediada up to modern Embaros on the southwest slope of Dikte; from there, one fork ascends east up to Omalos and over to Syme, and another fork leads north to Lasithi and the Diktaian Cave at Psychro. Despite Kato Syme's complicated stratigraphy, two Protopalatial phases with impressive serpentine ar- chitectural elements have been identified. The center of the sanctuary was an open area where stone li- bation tables were set at the edges of small fires, re- calling the arrangement atJuktas. Following a break after MM IIB, a reorganization of the peribolos took place with three recognizable Neopalatial phases. After the first of these, a paved road was constructed s30 A.

Between the peribolos wall and interior platform were traces of burning, fragments of stone offering tables (a few inscribed in Linear A), and other equipment: tubular stands, chalices with plain surfaces or relief decoration, figurines, huge numbers of conical cups, cooking pots, and jars, and the burnt and cooked bones of animals (sheep, goats, deer) suggesting ritual dining but not holocausts.64 Later in the Neopalatial period, the construction of Building 5 covered part of the ap- proach ramp. Although some fine bronze figurines have been found, the lack of "palatial" dedications is noteworthy in contrast toJuktas, and the most com- mon finds are pottery- often specialized cooking shapes and drinking vessels. Other sacred enclosures with terraces existed elsewhere on Crete, at the peak sanctuary at Kophinas on the south coast365 and at Petsofa above Palaikastro. Caves were also important, and a number of them show continuing use from MM II into LM I.366 There are Neopalatial deposits in the Diktaian Cave at Psychro on the north side of Mt. Dikte overlook- ing the Lasithi plain, the Arkalochori Cave in the Pediada plain, the Idaian Cave on Mt. Ida, and the cave of Eileithyia south of Amnisos at Episkopi. In all these locations, the finds include terracottas, along with bronze double axes and figurines. Much of the material deposited in caves is indistinguish- able from the material dedicated at peak sanctuar- ies, and none of the locations can be distinguished from others on the basis of its finds, except for Ar- kalochori with its rich deposits of bronzes and pre- cious metal double axes. This might mean that the same divinity was worshipped at each, or that offer- ings for one divinity were appropriate for another. Later Greek myth connects other caves with birth- places and the cults of goddesses: Dikte and Ida, for example, are associated with the worship of the mother goddess, Rhea, and the birthplace of her son, Zeus,367 but it is not possible to push these last iden- tifications convincingly back into the Bronze Age. The origin of the horns of consecration is uncer- tain, but they do not at all resemble bulls' horns: an early (MM II) plaster model of composite horns found at Petsofa suggests that they had a longstand- ing connection with peak sanctuaries, and perhaps their resemblance to the Egyptian horizon sign is not accidental.368 Horns, when attached to architec- ture, thus seem to signpost buildings or areas where ritual could take place. Large stone horns were set up in the courtyard at Nirou Chani and near the north and south entrances to the palace at Knossos; half of an immense pair of gypsum horns is now located at the north end of the west court at Knossos near the Theatral Area.369 In some representations, however, buildings are crowned by horns or by small qonical projections that cannot be equated with horns of consecration. At habitation sites, possible locations for ritual activity include paved courtyards, especially the cen- tral and west courts of the palaces, stepped "theatral areas,' and in the interiors of buildings in or at lustral basins, pillar basements, and polythyra.370 Raised walkways suitable for processions or dances have been noted in courts at Knossos, Phaistos, Nirou Chani, Archanes Tourkogeitonia, and Pyr- gos.371 The Knossos Sacred Grove and Dance Fresco shows gesticulating women in such a location, ob- served by male and female spectators. The Grand- stand Fresco has been interpreted as showing a rit- 364 Lembesi and Muhly pointed out to us that there is no evidence for holocausts (as in later Greek religion), but they noted that the heads of some animals may have been placed at the edges of the fires. 365 AR 42 (1996) 45: the main period of use is MM III- LM I. 366 P.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 ual activity in the central court of the Knossos palace. The size and shape of the courtyards and theatral areas, and the large numbers of spectators of both genders in the Knossos frescoes, once again stress communal, not individual, activities. Small construc- tions in the west court at Knossos and in the central courts at Zakros, Mallia, and Galatas may have had a ritual function. Those in the central courts would have presented obstacles if the central courts really were used for the sport of bull-leaping. The importance attached to architectural repre- sentation is reflected in the use of terracotta ar- chitectural models attested at a number of Proto- palatial sites, including peak sanctuaries. Important examples date from the beginning of the Neopala- tial period, like the models from the Loomweight Basement of the Knossos palace (traditionally MM II, but probably MM III), and funerary and domestic models from Kamilari.372 The house model from Ar- chanes (MM IIIA context) is two-storied. The ground floor plan resembles that of Zakros House G; upstairs, three steps lead up to a small projecting balcony on the roof on which are preserved the feet of a terra- cotta figurine. A similar scene appears on the Min- iature Fresco from the West House at Akrotiri where a woman stands at a balcony on the roof of a build- ing.373 Another Neopalatial terracotta model (a house or a shrine?) was found at the peak sanctuary on Mt. Juktas. The interior constructions identified as ritual areas are all, in some way, problematic. Lustral ba- sins, small sunken chambers approached by a short flight of stairs, are first attested at Mallia in MM II with an example that is truly subterranean.374 Shal- lower examples proliferated early in the Neopalatial period and have been found at most of the palaces and many, but not all, of the villas. Since they have no drainage, they are clearly not baths, and many of them are provided with low balustrades over which spectators could view activities in the interior. The figural fresco decorating a lustral basin on Thera depicts young women associated with crocuses and blood; if these paintings relate to the use of the Thera basin and if the basin was used in the same way as the Cretan examples, they should all have some con- nection with female rites of passage. If this identifica- tion is correct, lustral basins shed important light on the function of Neopalatial palaces and villas and again underscore the importance of women in Mi- noan society. Some lustral basins, including one at Chania painted with marbled decoration, had passed out of use before the end of the Neopalatial period, suggesting that the societal need for these rooms was changing. After the LM IB destructions, no more are built and existing ones are filled in. Pillar basements are another regular feature of Neopalatial villas and palaces, where they are often located in the west wings.375 Although ritual objects often fell into pillar basements from upper floor rooms when the buildings were destroyed,376 the dis- covery of pithoi and drainage channels in many of the basements indicates clearly that they are pri- marily storerooms. Similarly, polythyra with pier- and-door partitions are a regular feature of Neo- palatial palaces and villas.377 The many openings permitted free flow of traffic, and the openings could be closed selectively to create privacy, but their ritual use is unproven and very little specialized equipment has ever been found in them. During LM IB, the openings between piers at many sites were closed off by partitions and built cupboards, some- times for the storage of documents, suggesting that 372 Krattenmaker 1991 (supra n. 90); R.

It too disappears rapidly after the LM IB destructions. Several types of architectural construction repre- sented in frescoes, glyptic, and on stone vases are poorly represented in the archaeological record, no- tably the tripartite shrine (only surely attested in the west wing at Knossos), and constructions enclosing or adjoining "sacred trees"' which seem to be por- table since two are represented on ships.378 Four stone incurved bases found at Archanes Tourkogei- tonia may have been used as supports for a tempo- rary platform like those shown in paintings and on seals. Some representations of shrines have slender columns with floral heads, suggesting that such ar- chitecture could be set up quickly for specific events and then taken down.379 The portable nature of much other cult equipment may help explain why so little cult architecture has been found and rein- forces the notion that there were relatively few fixed locations for ritual. There is evidence for a small house shrine at a number of sites, though the equipment differs in each. A possible shrine on the Royal Road at Knos- sos380 included two tables of offerings, a small lime- stone horns of consecration, a fragment of an animal- head rhyton, and Special Palatial Tradition pottery. The shrine identified in the west wing of the Zakros palace is a figment: there is no direct connection between the room (which was devoid of special con- tents) and the workshops and storerooms with rit- ual equipment; as noted above, the latter rooms com- municated instead with the large banqueting hall of the palace. At Knossos, several upper floor rooms have been identified as shrines on the basis of the frescoes that once adorned them, but proof of their ritual use is again lacking. Special rocks, or baetyls, depicted on gold rings have been suggested as the seats of divinities or di- vine forces.38s In most of these representations, a man or a woman kneels at the stone, sometimes gesturing. It is possible that these stones were lo- cated in sanctuaries like the possible omphalos at Phylakopi. Many art objects have been identified as cultic or ritual equipment, not always on very solid grounds. Probable cult equipment includes stone kernoi (por- table and fixed) and offering tables, stone ladles, clay and stone rhyta of specialized shapes and decora- tion, plastered and painted tripod tables, sea shells (real and of faience, or stone rhyta carved in the shape of tritons), and nonfunctional double axes, often elaborately engraved, which may have been used as votives or emblems. The recurring emphasis on sea imagery, particularly on Marine Style pottery, could mean that important activities took place at the shore or even in the water (cf. the Mochlos ring). The various rhyton shapes made of stone, terra- cotta, and perhaps metal, along with conical cups, suggest that wine-drinking played an important role in cult activities. The distribution patterns of rhyta imply that most were manufactured at Knossos and perhaps disseminated from there to other sites. The possibly deliberate breakage of these objects has been discussed above. Tubular stands, the ancestors of the Final and Postpalatial "snake tubes"' were meant to support open bowls, perhaps for offerings.382 An- thropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines were made of terracotta, bronze, or lead, presumably for use as votive objects. Although bucrania are often represented in asso- ciation with double axes, there is no certain evidence that animals were sacrificed before the Final Pala- tial period. There may therefore be an aspect to the association of the bucranium and ax that we do not yet understand. 383 The double ax is combined with a loop-fillet, a frequent device on LM IB Alternating Style pottery. "Sacral knots" with fringed ends were sometimes manufactured in faience, painted on a wall at Nirou Chani, or carved of ivory.384 378 Tripartite shrine: Shaw (supra n. 134). "Sacred trees": B.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Another possible religious symbol is the figure- eight shield.385 Both the figure-eight and the tower shield had a functional use as body armor. But un- like the tower shield, the figure-eight shield appears in ways that suggest that it had a ritual symbolism as well. Repeating friezes of figure-eight shields ap- pear on pots as early as LM IA, and in LM IB this shield is a regular element on Alternating Style pot- tery, including an unusual piece from the Cult Base- ment at Knossos, which contained the bones of chil- dren. The shield also appears as ajewelry pendant, and a Minoan silver rhyton in the shape of a figure- eight shield comes from Mycenae Shaft Grave IV. The shield also appears on the LM I Vapheio ring (CMS I, no. 219). The principal Minoan cult symbol, the double ax, occurs as a motif in a variety of media.386 While double axes can exist as functional tools, many ex- amples survive made of thin bronze or precious metal, which could not possibly have been used for practical purposes. A fresco fragment from Knossos shows double axes attached to or embedded in col- umns that alternate with horns of consecration. Since the axes are portable, they could have been carried to the locations where they were needed, set in stone bases, and then removed after use. Since we never see the double ax being used as a sacrificial tool, the main function of the decorative examples may have been to demarcate the locations where ritual activities were to be performed. Attempts to identify divinities or their represen- tations are generally problematic. Most convincing is one iconographic topos: a large woman seated fac- ing left on an architectural platform attended by women and/or animals.387 This topos appears on several seals and gold rings, and in fresco, especially in the large-scale fresco from Xeste 3 at Akrotiri. A frontal Mistress of Animals appears on some Neo- palatial sealstones, wearing the "Snake Frame" head- dress and flanked by antithetic griffins or lions.388 The presence of antithetic griffins flanking the throne in a Final Palatial renovation of the Knossos throne room has been used to support the hypoth- esis that during the Neopalatial era a ruler or priest- ess occupied the throne in an epiphanic ritual.389 Recent discussion of the Final Palatial evidence for the throne room tends to obscure the fact that in the Neopalatial period the area combined a poly- thyron with a lustral basin. The three faience figurines from the Temple Repositories are some- times claimed as snake goddesses, but a wide chro- nological gulf separates them from the Postpalatial terracotta figurines holding snakes. Figures of women and men who hold one arm outstretched and grasp a staff or spear in the "com- manding gesture" have been called rulers or gods.390 The most likely to represent divinities are the small descending youth in this pose on a gold ring in the Ashmolean Museum and the woman in restored seal- ings from the area of a shrine on the west side of the central court at Knossos. 39 In the Knossos seal- ings, the woman with the commanding gesture stands atop a mountain peak flanked by antithetic rampant lions; to one side is an architectural representation with horns of consecration, and on the other side is a standing male who salutes her. Despite the small size of the elevated figures, their identification as divinities is strengthened by the presence of a woman on the ring and a man on the sealings, both of whom bow their heads and hold a clenched fist at the brow, a pose known from bronze statuettes of figures pre- sumed to be votaries. Opinion is divided over the man performing the commanding gesture on the Master Impression from Chania who stands atop a cityscape: he could be a ruler or a god.392 Many other proposed divinities are ambiguous or doubt- ful. It is difficult to identify gods and rulers because no text labels them and no trait distinguishes one 385 P. Rehak, "Minoan Vessels with Figure-Eight Shields," OpAth 19 (1992) 115-24.

This ambivalence underscores a fun- damental difference between Neopalatial Crete and its neighboring civilizations of the eastern Mediter- ranean. In almost every culture, even those with doc- umentary texts, the precise nature of the relation between god and ruler is problematic.393 Typically, rulers have claimed divinity in three ways - directly, rhetorically, or only on special occasions. If the seal that impressed the Master Impression was not a com- memorative piece, it may reflect one of the first two relationships. The evidence for cult statues is controversial.394 Although terracotta feet with pointed, upturned toes have sometimes been identified as the feet of stat- ues, like the separate feet inserted into the skirts of terracotta figurines in LM III, they have been found more often singly than in pairs, starting in the Pro- topalatial period.395 The scholarly investigation of gender in Minoan religion and society has gotten off to a slow start,396 despite much popular discussion about the role of women on Crete. The deposition of male and fe- male figurines at peak sanctuaries suggests that these locations were used by men and women, though per- haps at different times. Only two Neopalatial fres- coes (the Grandstand and the Sacred Grove and Dance frescoes, both from Knossos) show men and women together, but the women are larger and more elaborately dressed. In contrast to stone relief vases, where only men appear, women and animals like agrimia and blue monkeys are shown in nature scenes in frescoes and in glyptic, and there are repeated references to flowering plants like crocuses and lilies, which have medicinal properties. These gen- dered scenes suggest a culture/nature dichotomy rather than an innate interest in nature on the part of the Minoans.397 The only ritual activity that seems to include both women and men as partici- pants is bull-leaping. The use of wine seems to have played an impor- tant part in religious activities, including feasting, drinking ceremonies, and exchange systems among the palatial elite. One of the calcite Thera chalices was found with a miniature Minoan wine vat of the same material, suggesting a connection; the Vapheio ring depicts a large pithos at one side of the cult scene; and the wine pithos found in a country house at Epano Zakros has a Linear A inscription around its rim recording a huge quantity of wine, 32 units (921.61). Several installations for producing wine have been found in buildings with palatial features and fresco decoration. Finally, a number of rhyta and other vessels may have been used in drinking, along with the stone chalices found at various sites, the clay chalices from Kato Syme, and the ubiquitous conical cups. The archaeological evidence for the Minoan use of wine, and the depiction in fresco and glyptic of figures in exaggerated movement have led some scholars to postulate the existence of ecstatic religion.398 In summary, during the Neopalatial period reli- gion seems to have been used by the palaces and villas to support a political system in which the rul- ing class may also have been religious officials. The lack of identifiable cult buildings, the creation of open areas that could accommodate gatherings of people, and the portable nature of most Minoan cult equipment suggest that an essential aspect of Neo- palatial religion was its theatrical or performative nature.

If so, the Mi- noans were in good company, since this type of per- formative religion as an aspect of politics was well established in Egypt and the Near East, and exam- ples continue in some parts of the world today.399 LM IB Destructions Toward the end of the LM IB period, there is evi- dence for significant disruptions at a number of Minoan sites throughout Crete and at heavily Mino- anized sites in the Cyclades. At many locations, abandonment follows burning, and in many cases there is little sign of resettlement until LM IIIAl-2. The destructions thus mark a much more signifi- cant interruption of Minoan culture than those in MM II that signaled the end of the Protopalatial period. Major destructions are recorded at Chania and Nerokourou in the west; Phaistos and Ayia Tri- ada in the south; Mochlos, Gournia, Pseira, Pyrgos, Makriyialos, Petras, Palaikastro, and Zakros in the east; and Zominthos, Sklavokambos, Tylissos, the Knossos area, Archanes Tourkogeitonia, Amnisos, Nirou Chani, and Mallia in Central Crete. At Knos- sos, the palace is unique in having no identifiable LM IB destruction deposits, but several buildings in the surrounding community were damaged or de- stroyed: the Stratigraphic Museum area (including the so-called Cult Basement) and structures along the Royal Road.400 These destructions appear selective and carefully planned to destroy as many administrative centers as possible. Settlements, and specific buildings that housed Linear A administrations, are particularly badly hit, so much so that they seem occasionally to have been deliberate targets: at Pyrgos, the villa was burned, but not the surrounding town; at Moch- los, ashlar Building B2 was destroyed, but not the artisans quarter, which continued into LM II;401 and Kommos escaped a major destruction, though House X yielded limited evidence of LM IB burning. The causes of the Cretan and Cycladic destructions have not been determined to the satisfaction of all scholars, although three main interpretations have been advanced: natural causes such as earthquakes followed by fire, invasion by mainland Mycenaeans, or a Knossian takeover of the rest of the island.402 Several earlier attempts had been made to link the LM IB Cretan destructions with the IA Thera erup- tion; this position has now been abandoned by vir- tually all scholars. In any case, the conflagrations on Crete were so widespread that it is hard to attribute them to a single natural occurrence like earthquakes. If the destructions are the work of Mycenaean in- vaders from the mainland, Knossos must have been spared, perhaps to serve as a base of operations against the other Minoan palaces and administra- tive centers, with the exception of a few key places like Kommos. Such a Mycenaean military interven- tion might explain the deliberately buried hoards of bronzes at Knossos and Mochlos and the signs of violent death (unburied bodies at Mochlos and defleshed children's bones at Knossos, possibly from siege conditions) and looting.403 Following the de- structions, during LM II-IIIA1, new features appear on Crete that are similar to contemporary develop- ments on the mainland, though it is doubtful that there was an active Mycenaean colonization of Crete at this time.404 The military hypothesis also best ex- plains the concentration of new features in and around Knossos. Perhaps the Mycenaeans collabo- rated with the Knossians or even were invited into Crete by them. If LM IB Knossos was primarily a religious center, it may have been spared on those grounds. Alternatively, the wealth of Knossos and the presence of so many important workshops there may have made it too valuable to be destroyed. An alternative hypothesis of interstate warfare on Crete, without a Mycenaean component, could ac- count equally well for many of the arguments listed above. The introduction of Mycenaean features could have taken place without a military conquest, and 399 C. Geertz, Negara (Princeton 1980) 98-120. We thank M.

In searching for an agent of destruction, the obvious question is "cui bono"? Since the Knossos area survives relatively unscathed, some scholars have suggested that the destructions mark a Knossian take- over of the rest of the island centers.405 But it is hard then to explain the destructions at nearby Archanes, Tylissos, and Sklavokambos, all of which were pre- sumably within the Knossian orbit at the time they were destroyed. Moreover, sites that were receiving leather documents sealed and impressed by Knos- sian look-alike gold rings are also destroyed: Chania, Sklavokambos, Ayia Triada, Gournia, and Zakros. The destruction of administrative sites and elite objects could even be read in Marxist terms as a re- jection by an underclass of a ruling elite and its trap- pings. The eruption of Thera could have caused crop failure in East Crete, which could have destabilized the economy of the island and led to a dissatisfac- tion with the existing palatial system. It is also pos- sible to imagine a combination of factors, such as a Knossian takeover of the rest of the island with the help of Mycenaeans, some of whom stayed on the island and introduced new features. All assessments of the nature and intensity of the LM IB destructions on Crete, however, have been modified in recent years by the recognition that many sites show evidence of destructions throughout the Neopalatial period, including LM IA. In addition, there is some disagreement whether the Cretan LM IB destructions are all contemporary or not: per- haps what looks to us like a single horizon may ac- tually have taken place over years or decades. Whatever their causes, the destructions unques- tionably signal a major disruption in Minoan cul- ture and a rejection of many of the features we think of as characteristic of Neopalatial society and its sym- bolic language. With the losses come new features, some of which we characterize as Mycenaean, lead- ing us to prefer a scenario that includes some Myce- naean involvement. Some crafts survive, but we can document an immediate loss of decorative detail and a gradual decline in quality in the manufacture of decorated weapons, sheet bronze vessels, gold and silver plate, ivory carving for furniture and toilet im- plements, and stone vases. In hard stone seals, the decline occurs gradually over several generations. The losses in art and culture, however, are im- mense, and even a partial catalogue is staggering: Linear A, court-centered buildings, lustral basins, polythyra, stone relief rhyta, stone lion's and bull's head rhyta, stone chalices and maces, niello daggers, relief frescoes, and three-dimensional figures in faience and ivory.406 There is an end to experimen- tation in rendering the human figure, an end to work in exotic materials, a divorce between writing and art, and the disappearance of major iconographic themes such as marine motifs, enthroned women, and landscapes with women and animals. This last loss we feel is significant. The gendered dichotomy between the scenes involving men in fairly restricted activities and the natural landscapes that include animals and women is replaced in Final Palatial art with recurrent scenes of men, processions of men and women, and the constructed world. The losses in Neopalatial art and culture must reflect the subsequent preferences in the Final Pa- latial period. For example, Mycenaean religion ap- parently made little use of peak sanctuaries or caves, and so there was no need for the types of objects that portrayed them or had been dedicated there. Instead, the succeeding art forms- terracotta figu- rines, pictorial pottery, mass-produced jewelry, flat wall painting- and the prevalence of tholoi all ex- press different cultural values and constructions of political power. The Neopalatial period on Crete rep- resented a high point in Aegean culture that would not be reached again. FINAL PALATIAL CRETE (LM II-IIIB EARLY) As we stressed at the beginning of this review, the designation "Postpalatial" for the period on Crete following the LM IB destructions is no longer ade- quate, for it is clear that the Knossos palace survived and continued to function as an administrative center well after LM IB, and that Linear B was in use early in LM IIIB at Chania, and probably at Knossos too. With Linear B tablets being written at least at two major sites after LM IB, "monopalatial" does not ac- curately describe the period either.407 After LM IIIB early there is no evidence for writing in Crete or for any centralized administration; the period LM II-IIIB early, therefore, may be termed Final Pala- tial. Thus Crete contrasts with the mainland, where we know that some palatial administrations con- tinued to exist until the IIIBIC transition. LM II represents the immediate aftermath of the 45 W.-D.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Cretan destructions, and is a time of severe disrup- tion at most centers: some sites were abandoned, others depopulated, and only Knossos shows sure signs of operating on a large scale, including the con- tinued creation of a number of specialized prod- ucts. LM II may have seen a Knossian reestablish- ment of its control at other sites and may have been the first period of Mycenaeanization of the island.4?8 On the mainland, palaces seem to have begun emerging at this time, notably the Menelaion near Sparta.409 In LM IIIA, signs of recovery and reoccupation are seen at many sites on Crete, though most settle- ments are smaller and less urbanized than their Neo- palatial predecessors. New types of burials are intro- duced and there is a noticeable change in material culture. At Knossos, a destruction is documented at the transition from LM IIIA1 to 2 that is not mir- rored at most other sites, where recovery continues relatively smoothly into LM IIIB early. In pottery, the distinguished Chania workshop410 begins pro- duction in LM IIIA and by LM IIIA2 local pottery centers are known at Palaikastro and perhaps Epis- kopi. There is no discernible break between LM IIIA1 and 2 pottery, and existing trends continue on into IIIB early. While LM IIIA pottery is found abroad, especially in Cyprus, it is overshadowed by Myce- naean pottery exported in bulk. Nonetheless, Crete is not at all out of contact with the Near East. The IIIA1-2 interruption at Knossos is fraught with problems of interpretation; we give a summary here of opinions presented in more detail below. Sev- eral scholars who think that the Mycenaeans arrived at the time of the LM IB destructions believe that the Knossos palace no longer functioned after the IIIA1-2 break; they would date the Linear B tablets at the site to this horizon. Others have argued in- stead that the IIIA1-2 transition marks the first ma- jor arrival of Mycenaeans on Crete, and would date the Knossos tablets to the last phase of Final Palatial at the site (IIIA2-IIIB early). We follow a mix of these two scenarios: Linear B was probably being written at Knossos in IIIA1 but the final administrative ac- tivity probably belongs to IIIA2-B early. Whatever its causes, however, the IIIA1-2 transition is signifi- cant because it ends Knossos's longstanding role as premier administrative and artistic center in the Ae- gean, and marks the dissolution and scattering of its workshops and workshop personnel. In this last phase of Final Palatial we can see evidence of a per- manent change in Minoan art, the culmination of forces that had been in operation since the LM IB destructions. The following period, LM IIIA2-B early, is marked by the Linear B tablets at Chania and the inscribed stirrup jars (ISJs) at many sites. The Final Palatial period ends with another destruction at Knossos and perhaps at Chania. Thus, the Final Pa- latial, like the Neopalatial period, cannot be regarded as a single monolithic entity. Sites and Architecture A few sites have uninterrupted occupation from LM IB to LM II; while most are destroyed and aban- doned in LM IB, some are reoccupied in LM IIIA1, others in IIIA2.411 The overall population appears to have declined significantly by LM IIIB, especially in East Crete, although this trend toward depopu- lation had already begun in some places in LM IB. In the west, Chania was hard hit but began to recover immediately: squatters cleared some of the settle- ment in LM II.412 After a destruction by fire at the end of LM IIIA1, there was a short abandonment. In LM IIIA2-B early, reoccupation resulted in two building complexes, Houses I and II, making use of the orientation of some earlier walls. New features, however, suggest the presence of Mycenaeans: poorly constructed rubble walls, single-story buildings (no stairs and no material fallen from above), circular 40 LM II pottery has been found across the island.

In the south, the Mesara plain continued to be an important area.413 At Ayia Triada, in LM IIIA1 the impressive Megaron is erected, and in LM IIIA2 there is much building activity. The Megaron has enormous cyclopean foundations sunk several meters deep through the remains of the Neopalatial villa, and stone drainage channels were cut to draw runoff water away from the building.414 Although the Megaron's superstructure has not survived, the di- mensions of the foundations indicate a building larger than any of the surviving mainland megara. Adjacent to this building to the east was a small stoa, with a large and impressive second stoa to the north- east, the so-called Agora. Building W, of IIIA2 date, delimits another side of the Agora, along with build- ings on the slope to the west. There is evidence for two shrines, one west of the Agora and one to the southeast of the Megaron. Judging by architectural remains alone, Ayia Triada was a major administrative center, even though no Linear B tablets have been recovered there. With much imported pottery from the Near East and Italy, the port at Kommos flourished from the Neopalatial period through LM II into IIIA, but was almost completely abandoned at the end of IIIB early. In IIIA2, a series of shipsheds (Building P) was con- structed over the east wing of Neopalatial Building T. The masonry of this building reused Neopalatial ashlar blocks, but they were set in a new way with small stones in the horizontal and vertical joints, a style of Final Palatial architecture seen at many other sites on Crete. At Gournia, the ruined LM IB "palace" seems to have remained deserted, but in LM IIIA a megaron- like structure was inserted into the community at the south end of the plateia, on a different orien- tation from the Neopalatial structures.415 At Moch- los, a few new structures were built in LM IIIA2 making use of the earlier Neopalatial buildings; re- modeled, they continued in use into IIIB. At the east end of the site, a LM III cobbled road has been traced. Palaikastro had extensive IIIA1 reoccupation, and two wells dug through the earlier Building 7 were in use the entire IIIA period. North-central Crete follows, in general, much the same pattern as elsewhere. Tylissos, mentioned in the Knossos tablets, must have been an important Final Palatial center though the excavated LM IIIA architecture is scrappy.416 Simple house plans, a short stoa, and a circular cistern, like those at Ar- chanes, Amnisos, and Zakros, are among the inno- vations. Recent excavations at Quartier Nu at Mallia have revealed new features: a megaron with a fixed hearth flanked by two columns, a room with a rare pebble mosaic, and stirrup jars inscribed in Linear B.417 At Archanes Tourkogeitonia, much of the Neo- palatial building lay in ruins, but foundation walls associated with LM IIIA-B pottery were dug deeply into the west side of the building. As noted above, the only Minoan site that seems to have flourished uninterruptedly and on a large scale is Knossos.418 Both the palace and its depen- dencies, the Little Palace, Unexplored Mansion, and Royal Villa, show continuous occupation into LM IIIB. Another important sign of continuity is the erec- tion of a LM II house (not yet published) south of the palace that uses gypsum and includes a poly- thyron, an important indicator that the LM IB de- structions did not mark a complete break with ear- lier building practices. A megaron-type structure may also have been inserted into the palace at the south end of the west wing, but so little evidence has sur- vived that its existence is largely conjectural.419 The size of the community, however, may have shrunk since no other buildings occur on the hillside west 413Phaistos exhibits limited reoccupation, mostly houses (Kanta 96-101). The stepped construction in the northwest corner of the central court could be Final Pa- latial as well as the pithoi there (Atlas 235). 414 V. La Rosa, "Haghia Triadha in eta micenea," in J.-P.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 of the palace, except for the two stone-bordered cir- cular "dancing" platforms constructed in LM II-IIIA and excavated near the Stratigraphical Museum.420 In recent years, a restudy of the Little Palace and the excavation of its "villa annex," the Unexplored Mansion, have shed important new light on Knossos in LM II-IIIA.421 Both are Neopalatial buildings, but the latter may not have been completed at the time of the IB destructions, since the floor of its pillar basement had not been laid. The building was oc- cupied in LM II, although after one of several de- structions in this period the south half of the struc- ture was filled with debris and went unused while the north half continued to be occupied into LM IIIA and early B. At the same time there were mod- ifications in the Little Palace, including blocking up the polythyron. Within the palace there is evidence for contin- uous use and architectural modification through LM IIIA and into IIIB. While the east wing underwent some modifications, including blocked walls, and was eventually destroyed at least in part by fire, the west wing, which also was rebuilt, eventually collapsed.422 Especially important are the architectural modifica- tions datable to LM IIIA2-B early.423 These include new paving in the central court, the final arrange- ment of the throne room, and rearrangements in the west magazines. In the area of the South Base- ments, pits of plaster may attest to the same general construction efforts.424 Tombs and Burials In the period after the LM IB destructions new cemeteries with new types of burials are established in different parts of the island. Among these are War- rior Graves at Knossos, Archanes, Phaistos, and Chania, similar in form and contents to contempo- rary Warrior Graves on the mainland;425 chamber tombs, approached by a short dromos; "shaft graves" slightly different in form from those of earlier date at Mycenae; pit caves; and tholoi whose keyhole- shaped dromoi incline at the top. Near Knossos, several cemeteries were in use in the Final Palatial period on the hills flanking the Kairatos stream north of the palace. The Mavro Spe- lio cemetery on Ailias, east of the palace, was already in use in Neopalatial times. Farther north, on the west, is the Zapher Papoura cemetery established in LM II-IIIA1 and the contemporary scatter of tombs toward Ayios loannes and the New Hospital. Continuing up the Kairatos is first the small group of five LM IIIA1-2 tombs at Sellopoulo, and finally the Isopata cemetery with a number of graves includ- ing the Royal Tomb. Near the mouth of the Kairatos at Katsamba on the coast is a series of rich tombs that began to be used in LM II.426 It is generally assumed that the Katsamba, Zapher Papoura, and Sellopoulo tombs belonged to Myce- naean communities established at this time. Al- though it is difficult to determine ethnicity from grave goods or grave forms, many of the Katsamba tombs included Palace Style jars, just as many main- land tholoi had during LH IIA. Some graves in these and other cemeteries exhibit what seem to be other Mycenaean features: the practice of burying select individuals with important sets of bronze vessels;427 and burials on biers or beds or in wooden coffins painted blue, yellow, or red. 420 Warren 1983 (supra n. 400) 69.

An untouched LM IIIA2 larnax burial, a rich woman of high status, was found in the side chamber of Tholos A. Her jewelry includes four gold signet rings with religious iconography, one a Neopalatial heirloom. Of the three smaller gold cult rings, two feature friezes of figure-eight shields, while the third carries a double frieze of shields alternating with sacral knots. On the chamber floor were various offer- ings, including a necklace of blue glass beads and two gold rings, and, in front of the larnax, an ivory footstool decorated with images of warrior's heads and figure-eight shields. In a corner of the chamber was a full set of bronze vessels like those found in contemporary male Warrior Graves. The entrance to the chamber had been walled up, but in the fill was a hornless bull's skull, and just outside the door- way, on the floor of the tholos, was the carefully piled heap of a butchered horse. The deceased may have had both administrative and religious functions, pos- sibly connected with the Juktas peak sanctuary nearby. Sites in western Crete are also rich in the number and quality of burials. At Armenoi, on the upland plain immediately south of Rethymnon, a large new cemetery was established in LM II.429 The earliest tomb is underground and corbeled like a tholos. More than 200 rock-cut chamber tombs date to LM IIIAl-B, and several were marked by stone stelae, a Mycenaean practice. Other rich Final Palatial tombs have been excavated around Chania.430 In recent years, a number of large and impor- tant LM III tholos tombs have been excavated in west- ern and eastern Crete. Three of these share the un- usual feature of a rectangular chamber, two in the Chania area (Malame and Phylaki),431 and one south of Siteia at the edge of the settlement site at Achladia. Another architectural peculiarity further links the Malame and Phylaki tholoi: the lintel slab over the front facade, facing the dromos, is set vertically on end, to create a rectangular "plaque" over the doorway. Art Ceramics. LM II undecorated as well as decorated pottery has been recognized at an increasing num- ber of sites. It used to be thought that the chro- nological phase LM II was virtually confined to Knos- sos, a situation we now know is not the case.432 LM II pottery shows an increasing trend toward simpli- fying and fossilizing motifs, which some have attrib- uted to increasing mainland influence, although the trend was already apparent in LM IB and need not reflect either mainland influence or conquest. These general trends continue into LM IIIA and B in a clear evolutionary development with few interruptions.433 Three shapes have been considered typical of LM II: flat alabastra, Ephyraean goblets, and Palace Style jars. The flat alabastron is a shape that occurred in LM IB and on the mainland but became popular on Crete in LM II, both in pottery and in stone, the latter examples probably produced only at Knossos. During LM II/LH IIB, another mainland shape, the Ephyraean goblet, is also produced on Crete and in nearly identical forms.434 Contrasting sharply with the earlier semiglobular cup and the Vapheio cup, the Cretan goblets tend to be decorated with a rel- 36 B2, Chronika [1981] 398-99; BCH 106 [1982] 628-30; L.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 atively small number of motifs, usually the same on each side of the vessel: a stylized argonaut, a rosette, a lily, a palm tree, and a few other designs; a few ex- amples are decorated in the Marine Style. The Pal- ace Style jar is another characteristic LM II shape that descends from the large LM IB jar. These jars are imitated extensively on the mainland in LH IIA; in LM II Crete their decoration becomes increasingly schematic and simplified.435 Another important development in LM II is the increasing appearance of pictorial pottery on Crete, especially pieces depicting the human figure or birds.436 Two early examples come from the Unex- plored Mansion, ajug depicting a hunter with a spear and a pyxis with birds; both scenes recur on larnakes. The development of LM IIIA pottery closely fol- lows that of Mycenaean IIIA.437 The decorations in- clude animals, birds, and exotic plant life, as well as abstract patterns. All are rendered with confidence in an even style throughout the island that probably reflects close contacts. The cup with an everted or ledge-like rim appears first in IIIA1 and is paralleled by the kylix, a development of the Ephyraean goblet toward a shallower body and taller stem. Earlier shapes, like the krater and the stirrup jar,438 now be- come common, while the conical cup finally declines in popularity. At the beginning of LM IIIA2, the one- handled goblet or champagne cup with a low stem makes its appearance and these begin to replace the ledge-rimmed cup; in contrast, the kylix becomes less popular as its stem becomes even taller. What few naturalistic motifs remain are gradually replaced by more abstract patterns. In LM IIIA a new workshop at Chania begins pro- ducing a distinctive pottery whose fabric is pale gray with a yellow or pale orange slip and whose biscuit turns sugary white when scratched. The workshop flourishes in LM IIIA2, dramatically so in LM IIIB, before tapering off in LM IIIC.439 Its pottery is ex- ported not only throughout the island, but also to Cyprus, Sardinia, and the Greek mainland. Larnakes. Clay larnakes, in use throughout the Proto- and Neopalatial periods as coffins, and occa- sionally as storage containers in the Neopalatial and Final Palatial periods, come in two shapes, the chest larnax and the tub larnax, both perhaps inspired by wooden prototypes.440 The gabled lids are sep- arate, and usually fit tightly atop the clay chest. The box shape of the chest larnax created four rectan- gular side panels for painted decoration, six in the case of larnakes that have an extra set of legs in the middle of their long sides. These rectangular or square side panels are reminiscent of wall surfaces in buildings, and invited the type of decoration found in wall frescoes or in woven textiles. As coffins they become popular in the Final Pa- latial period, and their decoration is often elaborate. They are thus an important source of information about Late Minoan iconography and beliefs.

The side panels often include argonauts and octopi, fish, plants, birds, and ani- nials, of which bulls, deer, and agrimia are the most frequent. The landscapes that had ceased to appear in fresco at the end of the Neopalatial period now appear in abbreviated forms on larnakes, but fish and fowl are sometimes mingled. A cult symbol that appears frequently is the horns of consecration; one larnax in Rethymnon shows horns set atop an in- curved base. Human figures, mostly men, appear infrequently. One panel of a sarcophagus from Armenoi depicts a landscape with rockwork where a hunter armed with sword and spear lets fly at an outsized deer while he holds a dog on a tether in his free hand. On the end of the gabled lid of another larnax from Ar- menoi a mourning figure stands beside the deceased individual who is stretched out on a bier, perhaps a wooden one like those found in contemporary tombs. This may be our earliest prothesis scene, well known in Geometric art. From a tomb northeast of the villa at Ayia Triada comes a unique, frescoed limestone sarcophagus.441 The legs of the Ayia Triada sarcophagus and the roughly contemporary larnax from Archanes Tholos A are painted similarly with vertical bands of run- ning spirals. One long side of the sarcophagus shows the sacrifice of a bull and an offering at an altar in front of a small built shrine. All of the figures here are women, except for a male aulete. The other long side depicts the pouring of liquid offerings and a procession of three men holding small bulls (rhyta?) and a boat model moving toward an armless male figure standing before a building who may represent the deceased before his tomb.442 The end panels also show important scenes. One shows two women riding in a dual chariot drawn by agrimia altered from horses, the other a pair of women in a chariot drawn by griffins. Over the backs of the griffins ca- vorts a small, birdlike creature, probably a baby griffin since it shares the blue, white, and yellow colors of the adults. Frescoes. Only two sites have produced signifi- cant evidence of fresco painting after LM IB: Knos- sos and Ayia Triada, though at the former some Neo- palatial compositions remained on the walls. Almost no Cretan frescoes can be dated to LM IIIA2-B, with the possible exception of the frescoes in the Knos- sos throne room complex, the final architectural modification of which has been dated to LM IIIA2. On the walls flanking the stone throne are a pair of palm trees and recumbent antithetic wingless griffins (the papyrus blossoms included in Evans's reconstruc- tion and often reproduced are a mistake).443 This scheme, like the throne, probably repeats a Neopa- latial arrangement. In the east wing at Knossos, a fresco of dolphins has been attributed to a floor.444 The wall frescoes at Knossos assigned to the Final Palatial period on stylistic grounds show that some Minoan customs may have continued on Crete, par- ticularly those connected with the high status of women and the social importance of ritual activity. These paintings include the Toreador Panels with female, as well as male, bull-leapers, and a possible administrator or ruler in a dual chariot who wears the diagonally banded robe of men on some Neo- palatial sealstones, along with a sword baldric slung around his neck.445 Both sides of the west entrance corridor of the palace were lined with life-sized processional figures of at least two women and approximately 20 men, some carrying metal and stone vases.446 Both old and new elements can be seen. Although processions of men occurred on the Neopalatial Harvester Vase and in a fresco from Xeste 4 at Akrotiri, they now become standard in Mycenaean painting. Both women wear the Neopalatial Minoan robe and apron, garments now highly stylized, and perhaps worn only on special ritual occasions. The central figure in the 44' C.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 procession is a woman, separated in space from the files approaching from either side. She wears a dress patterned with beam ends and triglyph-half rosette designs,447 architectural elements that had been important in the iconography of the Neopa- latial palaces and their peak sanctuaries. Several men wear costumes whose detailed patterns and surface treatments recall those in Neopalatial paintings, and at least two individuals wear the early hide skirts, but others in the procession wear a new garment, the long tunic, a "unisex" robe increasingly evident in Mycenaean representations. The breechcloth and codpiece, which had been so prominent in Neo- palatial art, are apparently missing from the Pro- cession Fresco and are now confined to scenes of bull-leaping, even on the mainland.448 Even the undulating, horizontal background bands, alter- nately red and white, recall similar backgrounds from the earlier House of the Frescoes, but here they are static and repetitious as in subsequent Mycenaean painting. The multiple registers of the Campstool Fresco present intriguing problems of reconstruction and interpretation. Men sitting on campstools wear di- agonally banded robes and toast each other with LM IIIA stemmed kylikes in the presence of at least two women.449 One of the women, facing left against a yellow background, is at the same small scale as the men. The other woman, facing right against a blue background, is larger. Dubbed "La Parisienne" by Evans, she is armless like the presumed deceased on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus and wears an un- usual garment with a sacral knot attached to the col- lar at the back. As in the Procession Fresco, men are more numerous than women, reversing the gender imbalance of Neopalatial art, and their red sword baldrics and campstools with distinctive red tassels may allude to their high status. Sealstones. Knossian workshops were still produc- ing seals in the Final Palatial period, but it now be- comes difficult to distinguish between Cretan and mainland products, as if the gem engravers or even entire workshops were moving around and finding new homes. Sealstones whose animals have distinc- tively rendered "spectacle eyes" were produced at Knossos in IIIA1, but the location of the IIIA2-B early Island Sanctuaries workshop that made seals with smoothly modeled animals cannot be deter- mined precisely.450 In the Postpalatial period, hard stone seals were no longer produced in the Aegean (see below), although heirloom seals continued in circulation and were used on the mainland for ad- ministrative purposes. Some Neopalatial gold cult rings evidently sur- vived to be buried in Final Palatial tombs; other cult rings are more vigorous in style and these could date later, to LM II-IIIA. Similarly late could be a few flimsy rings of thin gold plate over a flat bronze core.451 Burials with bronzes are sometimes accompanied by large lentoids of a dark, rich red-brown agate, carved with bulls in recumbent poses.452 If this mo- tif is an insigne, it would be tempting to link it with a high official. Stone vessels. Following the LM IB destructions, there is a noticeable decline in the quality, variety of shapes, and volume of production of stone vases.

Cameron (supra n. 335) 587, pl. 4, dates it to Neo- palatial and moves it to the east wing to accompany the Grand Staircase, though the relative difference in height of the figures cannot match the changes in height of the staircase's risers. 449 PM IV.2, 379-90, pl.

These include approximately a dozen baggy gypsum alabastra from the throne room complex, some with lids and most with rim decoration of compass-drawn running spirals with dotted centers and handles shaped like figure-eight shields.454 While the alabastron resembles a Myce- naean pottery shape, the dotted spirals and figure- eight shield handles are Minoan. These gypsum vases were apparently in use at the time the palace was destroyed, though their exact purpose is unclear. They are too heavy to have been moved easily, and their contents (scented oil?) must have been taken out by dipper, not poured. Stone vessels, many of which were deposited in tombs, continued to be imported from Syria or Egypt. One important vase inscribed with the name of Tuth- mosis III found at Katsamba probably dates to this period but may be a Syrian imitation of an Egyptian vase. The Royal Tomb at Isopata, in use in LM II, contained a large number of imported stone vessels, including a shallow footed bowl with carinated sides. Similar examples have been found in Cyprus, Syria- Palestine, and Egypt, indicating that Crete was still part of an international network of trade.455 Metalwork. During the Final Palatial period, Knos- sos was still a center for the production of bronze tools and weapons. Of particular importance is the bronze workshop at the Unexplored Mansion in LM II. Analysis of these bronzes and bronze scrap shows that they contain lead from Lavrion, as do late bronzes from Ayia Irini in Kea, although that does not necessarily indicate where their copper came from. The metal vessels found in Warrior Graves on both Crete and the mainland at this time are virtu- ally certain to have been produced at Knossos.456 Three new sword forms belong to LM II-IIIA and are made only during this time: types Ci, Di, and G, all of which are found in Warrior Graves on Crete and in the Argolid.457 Type C swords are character- ized by"horned" hand-guards, type D by cross-shaped hand-guards. Type Gi swords represent a variant of type C swords and have a"dropped horn" hand-guard. Continuing the earlier tradition of decorated blades, though less elaborately, these three types of swords may have decorated hilts and a midrib with incised decoration, while some spear points are similarly decorated.458 After LM/LH IIIA, however, decorated weapons are no longer manufactured in the Aegean. An elaborate cruciform (Di) sword from the Chief- tain Grave at Zapher Papoura has a midrib and tang engraved with spirals, a gold foil hilt, and an agate pommel. Incised on the gold hilt are an antithetic addorsed lion and an agrimi; the same animals ap- pear in a chase scene on the hand grip. The design is important because of its pictorial style, recalling Neopalatial frescoes and the landscapes with pen- dant rockwork, as on the gold Vapheio cups. On the sword hilt there is even an attempt to render foliage, a single crocus flower blooming among the rocks. Also manufactured about this time are a spearhead 453 P.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 from a tomb at Archanes, decorated with running spirals, and the Lasithi dagger with incised decora- tion showing a man hunting a boar on one side and two bulls fighting on the other, a lineal descendant of the much more elaborately rendered scenes on the Neopalatial niello daggers.459 Precious metals continue to be used for jewelry and other ornaments, but many of these are of thin foil, often mass-produced in molds. At Archanes Phourni, funerary building 3 contained a large gold- foil cutout of a figure-eight shield that may have dec- orated a wooden box or piece of furniture, and the LM IIIA burials in Tholoi A and D included gold rosette necklaces or dress beads and a series of double argonaut beads that were evidently worn around the head as a diadem.460 With the LM IIIA1-2 disruption at Knossos, the relative homogeneity of Aegean metalwork breaks down, suggesting that there was no longer a single major palatial workshop on Crete. There is less evi- dence for the manufacture of large bronze vessels, decorated swords virtually disappear, and precious metal jewelry becomes increasingly scarce in habi- tation and funerary contexts. Important recent evidence for bronzeworking in the first half of LM IIIB comes from Palaikastro, where a pit was found in 1991 containing metal debris, tuyeres, crucibles, and molds for a double ax and a tripod stand of the type more familiar from Late Cypriot IIIA contexts in Cyprus. The Cre- tan example is important because it predates the earliest Late Cypriot IIC example found at Kalori- ziki tomb 40 and is larger than the ones often used in tombs.461 Ivories. Despite the fact that three-dimensional ivory figurines were no longer carved by the end of LM IB, a group of surviving Neopalatial ivories, prob- ably heirlooms, was found along the Royal Road in a LM IIIA context.462 Other ivory products, stylis- tically datable slightly before or after the Cretan destructions, may also have been produced at Knos- sos. Among these is an ivory comb from the Myce- naean grave enclosure at Archanes Phourni and, from funerary building 3 there, several plaques that prob- ably decorated a wooden box or piece of furniture. Four horizontal plaques, carved with almost identi- cal lions in a flying gallop, recall the gilded hexa- gonal wooden box from Circle A at Mycenae; both these lions and the agrimi on the large plaque have almond-shaped eyes, a shape that is popular on seal- stones in LM IB-II.463 A Knossian workshop may also have been responsible for producing what is ap- parently a new type of status symbol: a footstool in- laid with ivory figure-eight shields and warrior's heads. These have been found in tholos tombs at Archanes and at Phylaki Apokoronou, as well as on the mainland.464 The ivories from the tholos at Phylaki are impor- tant because they expand the Cretan artistic reper- tory in this medium. One plaque, carved front and back, has a tenon at the bottom, perhaps for inser- tion into a piece of furniture or a scepter. Two anti- thetic kneeling male figures are shown embracing, in a pose somewhat reminiscent of the women on the Mycenae ivory triad. Parts of three more male figures, carved in the round, were also found, along with crudely carved ivory plaques with standing sphinxes. A trait shared by all the faces of the Phy- laki ivories, including the warriors' heads on the foot- stool, is the carving of the eye in relief as an almond shape, with no indication of a pupil; compare the similar eye of a sphinx on an ivory pyxis from a chamber tomb at Thebes.465 Faience. Cretan faience manufacture lingered into 459 Zapher Papoura: Evans (supra n. 148) 55-58. A lapis lacedaemonius pommel with a gold foil ferrule found at Nichoria on the mainland probably came from a Knossos workshop as well (McDonald and Wilkie [supra n. 354] 262 no. 1008, 325 fig. 5-27, 845 pl. 5-52).

Writing and Administration The relationship of Linear B to Linear A has been analyzed extensively. It is often and wrongly assumed that Linear A developed into Linear B, that the two scripts are mutually exclusive, and that, since Linear B was used to write Greek, Linear A reflects a non- Greek language. While Linear B inherited numer- ous features from Linear A, including most of its syllabary, some interesting changes also occur. Linear B's writing style is more cursive, perhaps revealing a candid response to the papyrus and leather texts that the Neopalatial one-hole hanging nodules imply. Furthermore, Linear B often uses a format that strives for redundant clarity in its statements.467 From Knossos come over 3,000 inscribed Linear B tablets (fewer than 2,400 with provenience known) and 69 inscribed (19 with provenience known) and approximately 400 impressed nodules whose LM III date is presumed. From Chania come three or pos- sibly five tablets but no inscribed nodules; and from various places in Crete come 29 inscribed stirrup jars or their fragments.468 While the amount of ad- ministrative material from Knossos is thus large, its incomplete publication makes working with the ma- terial difficult.469 Chania provides the only ceram- ically dated contexts for Linear B documents. Three Linear B tablets were found on the floor of House I, room E, destroyed by fire early in LM IIIB, while another comes from pit H (primarily LM IIIA2 and B early pottery).470 No central or "final" archives deposit has been se- curely identified at Knossos. Instead, throughout the palace there are concentrations of tablets whose specific subjects suggest scattered bureaus, stores, or workshops.471 The few inscribed and impressed nodules with known findspots also support the iden- tification of"living" and "temporary" archives in stor- age and work areas rather than a "final" archives. Until relatively recently, it had been presumed that all the clay Linear B texts at Knossos belonged to a single administrative period, and had been fired hard in a single and final conflagration that also de- stroyed the palace. There are indications, however, that this "unity of the archives"472 did not exist. 466 Mycenae: Wace (supra n. 354) 281 no. 4910, pl. 137. Archanes: Archanes 131 fig. 109. 467 Linear B uses far fewer ligatures than Linear A. Whereas Linear A either uses the word or the ideogram for a commodity, rarely both (HT 88.2: FICus KI-KI-NA 7), Linear B usually uses both. 468 Knossos: Palaima (supra n. 279) 504 gives the num- bers of documents;J.-P.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Evans himself had selected the so-called Hieroglyphic Deposit from among scattered Linear B tablets and late impressed nodules.473 Driessen has established that the tablets from the Room of the Chariot Tab- lets were fired probably in LM II or early IIIA.474 The mix of Hieroglyphic and Linear B material in the west wing suggests the presence of "discard" archives. In fact, the lack of an identifiable main archive at Knossos may imply at least that other de- posits of documents belong to "discard" archives.475 If so, their firing, whether by one burning or several (e.g., by fires in LM IIIA2 early as well as in IIIB early), could have occurred long after the documents were inscribed and the nodules impressed. This more hap- hazard survival of the documents may account for the often noted incompleteness of several series.476 The controversy over the "final destruction" at Knossos has spanned four decades.477 In 1958 Ble- gen noted that Linear B at Pylos (dated LH IIIB2-C1) was too much like Linear B at Knossos to warrant a long chronological gap between them. Four years later, Palmer and Boardman published their debate over the stratigraphy at Knossos, with the eventual result that Evans's LM II date for the "final destruc- tion" of the palace was revised downward at least to LM IIIA early. Palmer later adduced strong reasons for proposing a LM IIIB date. Popham conducted two thorough reexaminations of the pottery and came to the conclusion that, though there was a de- struction by fire at Knossos in IIIB early, the major destruction responsible for burning the Linear B tab- lets occurred in IIIA late, which he eventually refined to IIIA2 early. In the late 1970s Hallager came for- ward as one of the first to support Palmer's case for the IIIB destruction, and Niemeier soon added more arguments. In order to resolve Blegen's problem, Pop- ham has recently suggested raising Pylos's destruc- tion to very early LH IIIB. As noted in our introduc- tion, we favor the early LM IIIB date for the end of palatial administration at Knossos. In addition to the difficult problems in reconstruct- ing the original stratigraphy and refining Minoan ceramic phases, the phrase "final destruction" im- plies assumptions concerning the importance of the palace as capital of the island or simply as regional center, the finality of its destruction (obliteration or one of a series of setbacks?), and, most important, its "Minoan" or "Mycenaean" cultural and ethnic char- acter. The difference between a "final" destruction in LM IIIA2 early and IIIB early is not great in terms of years, perhaps two generations, but the conven- tional cultural characterizations of these two periods are important: was a Minoan Knossos eradicated in IIIA to facilitate the growth of a Mycenaean empire that reached its zenith in IIIB, or was its destruction one of the earliest symptoms of the destabilization of that empire? The bias against locating Minoan culture beyond the boundaries of the Neopalatial period has produced severe dissonance in discussions of the island's later periods, especially LM IIIB-C, the period that has been, from the earliest scholar- ship, often characterized pejoratively ("squatters," "backwater"), whereas, as far as we can see, the Final Palatial period is just as distinctive as the Neopala- 473 Hieroglyphic tablets and labels were found in the Area of the Pictographic Tablets (the sottoscala at the north end of the west wing's north-south corridor), in magazines 4, 5, 6, 12, and 13, in the Room of the Lady's Seat, and in the Room West of the Stone Drum; they were found with Linear B tablets in magazines 4, 12, and 13.

The Postpalatial period was probably one of Crete's most prosperous and peaceful until recent modernity. In addition to stratigraphic and ceramic studies, there has been a major focus on the character and history of administration. Bennet and Shelmerdine have studied the political nature of Crete as a whole, and several scholars have concentrated on the clay nodules and their impressions.478 It seems logical that, when taking over the administration at Knos- sos, the Mycenaeans would have adapted the adminis- trative procedures already in place and dating back, relatively unchanged, to the Neopalatial period.479 On the mainland, where one can analyze Mycenaean sealing practices more or less clearly, there are no leather document sealings characteristic of the Neo- palatial period. Instead, the Mycenaeans seem to have resuscitated the use ofjar-stoppers and to have used two-hole hanging nodules exclusively as the nodule adjunct to their written documents (fig. 5).480 Knos- sos, according to the nodules from the presumably pure Mycenaean deposits in the east wing, followed these Mycenaean practices, with the addition that the two-hole hanging nodules were also pressed against containers. Contemporary nodules at Mal- lia and Chania are similar.481 At Knossos few seals were used to impress more than one nodule, reflecting a SSS system with a low- intensive, nonelite pattern of seal use. It would there- fore seem that nonresident seal owners were contrib- uting commodities to the palace and sending them, perhaps as taxes, along with an impressed nod- ule.482 Evidence for the internal administration of the palace is slight. There has been much speculation concerning the role of Knossos within the island in LM III. The ar- rangement of toponyms in the tablets clearly reveals that the palace recognized at least four separate geo- graphical areas. A fifth grouping links a-mi-ni-so (Am- nisos), ko-no-so (Knossos), and se-to-i-ja (Archanes/ Juktas?), perhaps because they were the main sanc- tuary sites. There must have been written commu- nication not only from Knossos to these sites but also from these areas to Knossos.483 478 See J.

Mycenae- ans may have exerted a more rigid control over adminis- trative concerns and a greater reliance on writing to ex- press them. We also see a slightly different filing system: many Linear A tablets record several commodities each and specify them by ideogram, but most Linear B tablets concern just one kind of commodity each. This procedure may reflect differences in the physical layout of some of the mainland palaces. Pylos had one storage area for oil and another for wine; the Knossos magazines, whose pi- thoi were of various shapes and sizes, may have been filled with an assortment of commodities. The items recorded on the tablets that fell into the magazines from rooms above may have had no connection with the objects stored in the magazines (pace Begg 55-56, and Popham, in Popham and Gill [supra n. 391] 57). 480 Weingarten 1988 (supra n. 269) 13: "All Pylian seal- ings are hanging nodules (most akin to Knossos Class VI/A)"; cf.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 Since Knossos was interested in separate districts from the far west to perhaps the western borders of Lasithi,484 it seems logical to assume that Knos- sos had some kind of centralizing control over the island, especially since some places mentioned in the tablets (e.g., Phaistos) do not appear archaeo- logically to have been able to function administra- tively on their own. On the other hand, the Neopa- latial distribution of palaces and villas suggests at least a partial decentralization, which may have con- tinued in the form of secondary regional centers sur- rounded by small settlements. The Knossos tablets mention most of the conven- tional officials known in somewhat more detail on the mainland. The surprisingly small number of ref- erences, however, may reflect the tablets' focus on external administration.485 Much discussion has cen- tered around the identity of those whose name in the genitive heads lists of workers; scholars refer to them as "collectors" or "supervisors."486 One oddity is that the names of several collectors recur at var- ious places in the Mycenaean world. The interest of Knossos in the outlying areas cen- ters mainly around the textile industry and the man- ufacture of four kinds of wool cloth,487 ranked ac- cording to thickness. Linen cloth is not fully recorded at Knossos, but may appear on one tablet as the ma- terial for the special garment *146 (a tunic?). Bor- ders (o-nu-ke), fringes, and tassels (ko-ro-ta2) are listed separately. Some male workers are recorded in the textile industry as fullers (ka-na-pe-we), who may also be finishers and decorators, and as weavers. Women, however, outnumber men 2 or 3 to 1, and these, along with their children and TA and DA supervisors, re- ceived allocations of raw material from the central authorities from which to make cloth. Tablets record production targets and the receipt of the final prod- ucts in the palace. Female decorators (a-zelke-ti-rija) are specialists, stationed outside Knossos, where special cloth is produced from which they make fancy borders. Other female cloth workers include weavers and spinners, women who make special kinds of cloth (ne-ki-ri-de workers, ko-u-ra cloth), "old women" (ka-ra-we, ypausq), and possibly "apprentices" (di[-da-ka-re]). Related to the textiles is the interest in maintain- ing large flocks of sheep, especially wethers (castrated adult males) that produce the better wool.488 The flocks in areas far away were apparently administered by the collectors, while the flocks in nearer areas are grouped according to assembly places (a-ko-raja, re- lated to &amp;yopd?). Since the nearer sheep number twice as many as the farther sheep, and since the approximately 100,000 sheep listed in the Knossos tablets needed well over 100,000 ha of grazing land, it is likely that the main area of concern was Central Crete.489 Another region that figures prominently is Da-wo, a place closely linked to Phaistos. Knossos tablet F(2) 852 records 10,000 + units of grain there, or approx- imately 960,000 1.490 Da-wo must be somewhere in the Mesara, which makes it certain that that plain functioned as a "breadbasket" as much in the Final Palatial period as it did in the Neopalatial. Trade and Interconnections It is difficult to assess Crete's contacts with the east- ern Mediterranean in the Final Palatial period. LM pottery continues to be exported to Cyprus. On the basis of early LM IIIA2 pottery from the cemetery at Kition and because of the presence of horns of consecration at Kition, Myrtou-Pigadakia, and Pa- 484 Ra-su-to in group II may be "Lasithi," although that name cannot be traced earlier than the Byzantine period: Bennet (supra n. 292) 240; C.B. Kritzas, "Nia e.ttypapwtKa otOiXsia yta tryv EstutpoXoyia Too AaooOuoo," 8th CretCong (forthcoming). 485 The wanax is associated with spice, and his bureaus are concerned with cloth and perhaps with purple dying (T.G. Palaima, "Maritime Matters in the Linear B Tablets," Aegaeum 7 [1991] 273-310); the bureau of the ra-wa-ke-ta is responsible for grain; Anutos, the qa-si-re-u at Knossos, and Sukereos, the qa-si-re-u at Setoija, are responsible for men; some te-re-ta hold plots of land in the central region, and a te-re-ta of Aptera is responsible for 45 men; the e-qe-ta Pisawatas is at Knossos, and an e-qe-sija bureau is respon- sible for fine cloth borders; a mayor (ko-re-te) in the west supplies an ox; and there is a vice-mayor (po-ro-ko-re-te) at Qa-ra, and an unknown functionary, the a-ke-re-mo-no. 486 In Olivier (supra n. 414), see the following: J.

Popham, however, postulates a suspension of trade between the two islands.491 The bulk of Ae- gean pottery found in Cyprus and the Near East is said to be Mycenaean, although this has not been scientifically tested.492 Minoan pottery, however, is found in the Near East and surprising amounts of Canaanite pottery come from Kommos, along with Egyptian pottery and Canaanite anchor stones.493 In the Final Palatial period, pottery workshops at Chania were producing wares that were exported elsewhere in Crete, to the Greek mainland and the Cyclades, east to Cyprus, and west to Italy and Sar- dinia.494 Chania was also producing stirrup jars for trade, some with painted inscriptions that were be- ing exported to the mainland. There are signs of growing contact with the west.495 Handmade burnished ware in typical sub- Apennine shapes has been found at Kommos in IIIA1 levels and at Chania starting in IIIB early and con- tinuing into IIIC; although the pottery looks Italian, analysis of some pieces shows it to be local. Presum- ably, then, some pots at least were made by resident Italians for their own use, rather than imported from Italy. The same contexts at Chania have yielded wheel- made Gray ware cups and kylikes, some with high- swung handles. The source of this ware has not been determined, but it may not be Italy; similar pieces have been found in Anatolia in chamber tombs at Miiskebi near Halikarnassos. The LM II-IIIA period also marks significant changes in Egypt's relations with its neighbors, in which the inhabitants of the Aegean clearly played a part. Following the expulsion of the Hyksos, the Egyptians had embarked on the creation of an em- pire in Syria-Palestine that eventually stretched to the upper Euphrates. By the mid-15th century, Ae- gean merchants would have been trading at Syrian ports, some of them under Egyptian control. It is not surprising, therefore, that we find Aegean natives, occasionally labeled Keftiu, represented in Egyptian tombs at Thebes, along with Syrians and other foreigners.496 Although the Keftiu had vanished from Egyptian paintings by the time of Tuthmosis IV, a trade in tex- tiles from the Aegean seems to have continued to influence decorative patterns, which often survive painted on the ceilings and walls of tombs and palaces. Ceilings in the tomb of Senenmut included meander patterns or interlocking running spirals with dotted centers, alternating with rosettes, all of which find close parallels in Minoan decorative pat- terns.497 These continue until at least the end of the 18th Dynasty. A well-known ceiling from the palace of Amenhotep III at Malkata (West Thebes) includes running spirals with dotted centers alternating with bucrania supporting rosettes. The long reign of Amenhotep III overlaps with much of LM IIIA1-2, during which Crete, not the mainland, receives the lion's share of Egyptian im- ports.498 The discovery of LH IIIA2 pottery and a few incipient IIIB sherds at Akhenaten's short-lived capital of Amarna fits what we know of the reigns 491 Kommos III, 157 lists Cypriot pottery in IIIA levels at Kommos: 22 White Slip milkbowls, two Base Ring juglets and a bowl, a White Shavedjuglet, two Plain White Wheel- made pithoi, and an amphora.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 of the immediate successors of Amenhotep III; Amarna was probably abandoned during the reign of Tutankhamen. Inscribed objects dating to the reign of Amenhotep III have been found both on Crete and the mainland, and the "Aegean itinerary" on a statue base in Amenhotep's funerary complex at Kom el-Hetan and faience plaques at Mycenae support the notion that Egypt was acknowledging the increas- ing importance of the mainland centers. Religion During the Final Palatial period, marked changes in Minoan religion take place, following what ap- pears to be a massive rejection of the Neopalatial religious-political system at the end of LM IB. While there is evidence for both continuity and change, the following five main developments may be noted in particular. First, as noted above, the production of certain types of palatial prestige ritual objects ceases after the LM IB destructions. Some of these objects are now appropriated for tombs. Tripod offer- ing tables of stucco or clay continue, including painted examples, but these are also sometimes found in tombs.499 Second, certain Neopalatial sym- bols of possible religious significance become un- common or disappear: inscribed stone offering tables are no longer produced (though some are re- used), stepped stands for double axes and the sacral knot seem to vanish, and stone and stucco horns of consecration are replaced by painted examples on pottery and terracotta larnakes. Third, cult equipment on Crete is increasingly manufactured of terracotta, a trend that continues to the end of the Bronze Age. The house or sanctu- ary models of the Proto- and Neopalatial periods are superseded by "hut models." Plastic horns of con- secration are modeled on some stands.500 Tubular stands, which may have had a cultic use in the Neo- palatial period, now become larger and more elab- orate. With the addition of plastic surface decora- tion resembling snakes, these are now referred to as snake tubes, though they may have no connection with these animals. There is also a resurgence in the use of terracotta for zoomorphic and anthropomor- phic (especially female) figurines, and these are now found in several locations, including shrines con- nected with habitation areas. It has not been estab- lished whether these figurines represent goddesses or votaries, but they have an important role in the small shrines, where they are often set on stands or benches facing the doorway to the room. Many of the female figurines have upraised arms, a gesture of uncertain meaning. A seminal study by Alexiou labeled this type the "Minoan Goddess with Upraised Arms" (MGUA).501 Although these are especially characteristic of the Postpalatial period (see below), they originate in the Final Palatial period or earlier. Their gestures may derive from the upraised arms of Neopalatial faience figurines or of the women on sealstones who wear the "snake frame" headdress. The mainland class of psi, phi, and tau figurines is introduced into Crete in LM IIIA2, a sign of Myce- naean presence.502 The IIIA2-B period also sees the introduction of large wheelmade bovid figurines. Moldmade bovid rhyta had existed in the Neopala- tial period, but these seem to die out after the end of LM IB. The concept of the bull rhyton is revived, perhaps under Mycenaean influence, but the rhyton is now much less naturalistic in form. Fourth, new types of cult practice become visible, particularly in the area of funerary cult. As we have seen, painted terracotta larnakes introduce a new iconography, and the painted sarcophagus from Ayia Triada provides one of the most important, if de- 499 The ears and inlays from a bull's head rhyton in the Tomb of the Double Axes at Knossos: Evans (supra n. 148) 52 fig. 70.

V.3). The so-called Shrine of the Double Axes in the Knossos palace, Gesell 90-92, was dated by Evans to LM IIIB, but its female figurines may be of LM IIIA date. Other female terracotta figurines were found in the Little Palace (Gesell 93-94), in a domestic shrine at Kannia near Phaistos (Levi [supra n. 52] 253-64).

A major development of the Fi- nal Palatial period is the evidence for bull sacrifice; it is possible that the killing of the animal now be- comes the final feature of the Minoan bull-games, perhaps under Mycenaean influence. It may be sig- nificant too that the bull sacrifice is attested at ex- actly the moment when the new iconographic topos of the Minotaur appears on seals. If the minotaurs represent men in masks, they may be appropriating some of the powers associated with the bull for sym- bolic, even shamanistic, purposes.503 Women still played an important role in religion, however, as the Knossos Procession Fresco, Ayia Triada sarcophagus, and Archanes Tholos A all demonstrate. Fifth, it is hardly surprising that there is slight evi- dence for a general reuse of peak sanctuaries in LM II-III,504 generally at peaks that are close to habita- tion sites. Continuity of cult activity occurs atJuktas and Kato Syme, and although prestige dedications decline, they are nevertheless still present,505 and sherd material indicates that cave cult continues as well. A new feature is the emphasis on small "house shrines" or "town shrines." Some of these replace Neo- palatial ritual areas, like the "fetish shrine" in the Little Palace from a remodeled lustral basin, while others appear to be new creations (the Shrine of the Double Axes in the Knossos palace; the freestand- ing town shrine at Ayia Triada; and the Gournia town shrine). The use of piers in the Shrine of the Double Axes and the piers and floor fresco at Ayia Triada may be deliberate attempts to recall Neopalatial forms.506 A LM IIIA2-B house shrine in Building 7 at Palaikastro included pithoi, a terracotta bull's head rhyton, triton shells, cylindrical stands, stalactites, and benches. A distinctive feature of the new small shrines is the bench at the back of the room, used to support MGUAs, along with other figurines and offerings. Finally, the Linear B texts shed light on the reli- gious concerns of the major administrative centers. Most of the Linear B religious texts from Knossos concern amounts of oil or honey going to various divinities: Ares, Diktaian Zeus, Enyalios, Eileithyia, Erinyes, Pan (?), Paian, and Poseidon. The Pantheon (pa-si-te-o-i, in the dative) is frequently mentioned, at Amnisos, at Au-ri-mo, and at a locality not specified and probably therefore Knossos. At Chania there is mention of a shrine of Zeus as well as the god Dionysos for the first time.507 At least one sanctuary and possibly more existed at Amnisos. The divinities mentioned there are Eileithyia, Ares, probably Poseidon, and frequently the Pantheon. Of the religious administration, there is mention of a couple of shrines, the da-da-rejo (the Daidaleion), the da-pu2-ri-to (Labyrinth), and the shrine to Diktaian Zeus. There is a qe-ra-si-ja (Gerou- sia?) at a locality not mentioned (probably Knossos), as well as at Amnisos and at Au-ri-mo; but only one type of priestess is listed, the Priestess of the Winds located at three sites, *4 7-da, Au-ri-mo, and U-ta-no (Fp 1 and 13), and only one priest is mentioned, that at da-*83ja (Fp 363).508 More controversial have been the mentions of a da-pu2-ri-tojo po-ti-nija and a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja.

POSTPALATIAL CRETE (LM IIIB LATE-SUBMINOAN) Sites and Architecture Both the beginning and the end of the Postpala- tial period have proved difficult to define, except by the apparent loss of literacy on Crete.511 On pres- ent evidence, there were no palatial administrations anywhere on Crete from LM IIIB late through the end of the Bronze Age. Some inscribed stirrup jars in late IIIB contexts at Quartier Nu, Mallia, could simply be holdovers. Similarly, scholars have debated over how to define the end of the Bronze Age on Crete. Is it marked by the latest IIIC pottery, or does a Subminoan phase exist as an independent period transitional to the ProtogeometriclEarly Iron Age?512 Despite the nebulous boundaries to this period, there is general agreement that the picture of Post- palatial Crete is vastly different from the scenario envisioned earlier by Evans and Pendlebury of de- pressed refugee populations hiding in the moun- tains.513 Nevertheless, it is clear that the disappear- ance of palatial administration after LM IIIB early marks a watershed on Crete. Up to this point, there had been evidence across the island from both hab- itation and burial sites. The most common Postpa- latial site, however, is the tomb, with few habitation sites known for the latter part of LM IIIB and C. While some tholoi appear fairly canonical, most in the Post- palatial period are small, with diameters and heights of about 1 m.514 They contain only a few burials, sometimes in larnakes. The diminishing number of settlements from LM IIIB late seems to indicate a shrinking of population. In IIIC, a progressive movement away from the shore may have occurred, though what this means precisely is still being debated. Sites toward the eastern end of the island, like Kavousi Vronda and Kastro, Vro- kastro, and Vasiliki Kephala, however, are near the coast and have good views of the sea, as does Karphi. It may be, as Watrous suggests, that piracy forced the move inland and to higher elevations, as well as 5o9 da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja: Gg 702. L.

At Chania new houses are built and the Mycenaean settlement is extended farther up the Kastelli hill.516 At least one import from Cyprus and local imitations of Italian hand- made burnished ware are known. After a heavy fire destruction at the end of LM IIIB, some reoccupa- tion took place in LM IIIC, with reuse of rooms and new construction. Though there are few finds, local imitations of Gray wares are among them. No major destruction occurs at Chania in LM IIIC and the site is quietly abandoned before reoccupation in the Late Geometric. Excavations conducted by a Greek-Italian team in western Crete in 1989 and 1990 have revealed a new LM IIIC settlement site at Sybrita, with pits containing bones, traces of burned material, and pottery (coarse and fine wares).517 Quartier Nu and several other areas at Mallia ex- perience a destruction by fire in LM IIIB early, fol- lowed by an orderly cleanup and reoccupation. A destructive fire at the end of IIIB and scanty occu- pation in IIIC follow, with an abandonment before the end of the period. Gournia's Mycenaean build- ings west beyond the ravine may date to LM IIIB; at least one Mycenaean burial took place in the ear- lier town. Along the coast east of Herakleion thriv- ing settlements existed, with houses at Katsamba, Poros, and Gouves. Some sites, however, disappear in LM IIIB: Pseira is abandoned early, Chondros is destroyed by fire and abandoned, and Kommos is virtually deserted toward the end of IIIB early though small amounts of late IIIB and C pottery have been found at the site.518 Ayia Triada has LM IIIB pottery but not, ap- parently, LM IIIC. The South-West houses at Knos- sos are abandoned, and LM IIIC Knossos is known primarily from tombs. While a few sites are abandoned in LM IIIC (e.g., Stavromenos-Chamalevri), some new sites are also founded. Those at high elevations are well known: Karphi and Kavousi Vronda are first settled early in the period, Prinias and Chalasmenos are settled by the end of the period, and Arvi and Katalimata sometime in IIIC. Some sites lower down, however, also thrive: a house in Katsamba contained iron in its second phase and Phaistos is well settled into the Subminoan period. A couple of sites seem to move their populations late in LM IIIB or in LM IIIC: Ayia Pelagia may move to Kastrokephala, which is sur- rounded by a fortification wall, late in IIIB; Zakros has little if any LM IIIB pottery, but the Lenika peak in the adjacent Gorge of the Dead is inhabited in LM IIIC. Palaikastro suffers a fire late in LM IIIB and the population apparently moves to the acrop- olis Kastri, overlooking the sea for LM IIIC. In recent years, intensive excavation and survey work by several teams in the Gulf of Mirambello and Isthmus of lerapetra have revealed important evi- dence for the final phases of Bronze Age Crete: Ka- vousi (Vronda and Kastro), Vrokastro, Chalasmenos and Katalimata, and, at the edge of Lasithi, Karphi. Another large IIIC habitation site has been identified by survey at the peak of Profitis Elias south of Epis- kopi.519 Importantly, many of these late commu- 515 A summary of the settlement history in the Lasithi plain makes the trend toward a shrinking population clear (L.V.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 nities are preceded by evidence of early habitation, generally Neolithic, EM II, and MM II. The late set- tlements thus are not new foundations, but rather reestablishments of previously existing sites. Kavousi actually consists of two settlement sites initially explored in 1900, a lower one at Vronda (380 masl) and the upper one at the Kastro (700 masl), separated by a short walk. Like many sites in this area, Vronda had Neolithic and Early Minoan re- mains (EM IIB-III) and extensive MM II habitation. In LM IIIC the area was reoccupied, and at least one building (E) was probably abandoned at the end of IIIC. Room 1 in Building E contained pithoi in differ- ent shapes and decoration. A Late Geometric ceme- tery is at Vronda. At Kavousi Kastro nearby, three main phases have been identified: I (transitional from IIIB-C), II (mid-IIIC), and III (late IIIC, contempo- rary with Vronda). Kastro thus is important because it appears to give a complete habitation sequence through LM IIIC. Phase V represents a transition from LM IIIC to Protogeometric. Watrous has argued persuasively for paired vil- lages, one below the elevation limit for olive trees (600-800 masl) and one above in the mountainous regions suitable for herding; such paired sites would include Kavousi Vronda and Kastro. In addition, Nowicki's indefatigable mountain surveys across the island have revealed a more horizontal dimension; sites at high altitudes often work together to guard passes and oversee approaches to the upland val- leys.520 Habitation at these sites is not limited to the Postpalatial period, but recurs throughout Crete's history. The new excavation ofVasiliki Kephala under the direction of Eliopoulos is also changing our percep- tions of this period.521 A small tholos tomb had been excavated by Seager south of the site in 1906. Although naturally defensible, Kephala occupies a relatively low-lying site (213 masl) on the flat-topped ridge just above Vasiliki, far lower and more acces- sible than some of the other Isthmus sites. More im- portantly, the location of Kephala gives it direct con- trol over trade and movement of people north and south over the Isthmus, and a direct line of sight to contemporary sites like Kavousi Kastro and Vronda, and Chalasmenos. Excavations since 1994 have already revealed a substantial settlement, LM IIIC to Protogeometric. The Dark Age settlement was large, occupying the whole flat top (ca. 230 m, north-south) of Kephala hill. Parts of 10 buildings, in varying degrees of preservation, have been located. One, Epsilon, has been completely excavated and seems to be unique for the period; a temple com- plex (17 x 25 m), it consists of eight rooms grouped in three wings, each of which may have served a specific cult function. In the south wing, cult figures and equipment were found in situ on benches. Parts of at least five MGUAs have been recognized, one of them enthroned (H. 44 cm), as well as snake tubes, fenestrated stands, and votive backing plaques. In the main room of the central wing two axial wooden columns rested on stone slab bases framing a cen- tral hearth. In an attached magazine an heirloom seal with a cow suckling a calf was found. The north- ern wing consists of large rooms, one of which (E3) may have seen important cult activity (fig. 8). It has low benches around the walls and in the middle a low stone platform incorporating an upright un- worked stone, possibly an altar with baetyl. At Chalasmenos, traces of a small settlement have been excavated since 1993 by ajoint Greek-American team. On either side of a rocky outcrop some pre- served house walls incorporate the natural bedrock, and individual stones about 0.5 m in diameter pre- sent worked interior and exterior faces. Rooms are small, with doors generally at the ends of their short sides. Roofs consisted of wooden beams covered by hard-packed waterproof orange-yellow clay, with floors of hard-packed earth. In some rooms, flat stones on the floor served as vessel stands and hearths consisted of small stones. A small tholos, A, is located nearby, built of medium and large blocks in seven courses. It held the bodies of five individuals, four adults and one adolescent.522 Though short by today's standards (H. men ca. 168.5 cm, H. women 145.6 cm), they were muscular and robust. A kalathos from Tholos A has a nearly exact parallel from the settlement, and both may have been made by the same local potter. Some architecture survives from the LM IIIB late and IIIC periods.523 Where the terrain permits, square house plans seem to be common: Chania in 520 Watrous (supra n. 515) 322-27. E.g., K.

Where the steep terrain limits the accessible area, as at Kavousi Kas- tro, Vrokastro, Karphi, and Katalimata, long rectan- gular houses with rooms in rank occupy narrow ter- races. Chania, Karphi, and Kavousi Vronda provide some idea of a village plan: units clustered closely together, in no rigidly maintained alignment, sep- arated by dog-leg alleys. An occasional plateia breaks the claustrophobia, allowing for outside work areas and gatherings. The result is not unlike modern Cre- tan traditional villages. Walls at Chalasmenos were preserved up to 1 m in height and consisted of care- fully laid limestone blocks held together with a mor- tar of mud, as at Vronda. One oddity, the absence of an apparent doorway, has commonly led to the assumption that these rooms are basement rooms, but in early modern villages in Crete doorways are often raised above the level of the exterior road or alley and approached by a short flight of steps that hugs the exterior wall. Important buildings may be isolated and rectan- gular with a central rectangular hearth flanked by two wooden columns on bases (Chania, Vasiliki Ke- phala). This form later becomes the Archaic Cretan temple like those found at Kommos and Prinias. The LM IIIB and C temple, however, seems to consist of a building that is rectangular (Kavousi Vronda) or square (Vasiliki Kephala) with one or more benches on which to set MGUAs, and a storage room at one end. A special type of site is the so-called refuge set- tlement, placed high atop a mountain and sur- rounded by a cyclopean fortification wall.524 These sites, however, are not limited to this period only; as noted above, the "refuge" fortification wall onJuk- tas may be Neopalatial. Art A significant, and as yet unresolved, problem is the ceramic chronology and phasing of LM IIIB- C.525 Nevertheless, excavators on Crete are in gen- eral agreement on two points: IIIB-C pottery shows innovations that indicate that it is not simply trail- ing behind developments on the mainland, and the stylistic sequences worked out for the mainland by Furumark and others do not hold for Crete. Current research is directed to establishing these later se- quences. Groundbreaking work in the former area took place at the conference on LM III pottery held at the Danish Institute in Athens in 1994.526 The most common IIIC shapes are stirrup jars, kraters, and bowls, continuing the trend toward fewer shapes in use. Painted decoration becomes sim- 524 Hayden (supra n. 511); K.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 plified and does not fill the entire surface of the pot. Close Style pottery is present on Crete throughout IIIC; it does not develop within it. A diagnostic fea- ture of IIIC stirrup jars is a bump atop the "spool" of the handle, with the "spool" itself added separately, not pinched out of the clay of the vessel. One un- usual IIIC shape is the lid, which often has piecrust decoration and burning on the underside. These may be fire-dampers. Pictorial vase painting, which continues into the Early Iron Age (see below), has attracted attention, although major studies have been conducted so far only on pictorial larnakes. Coarse ware pottery is also finally receiving serious consideration.527 After LM IIIB early, many art forms become de- funct. No frescoes, hard stone seals, or stone vases seem to be manufactured in this period or later, and it is doubtful that faience or ivory is being worked anywhere in the Aegean. Instead, many objects man- ufactured earlier are now deposited deliberately as heirlooms. For example, the surviving examples of seals are now offered as votives in tombs and shrines; a few come from late contexts in domestic areas.528 Trade and Interconnections In Crete, Mycenaean pottery continues to be im- ported, while Chania Workshop pottery is exported to Boeotia, Euboea, the Cyclades, and Cyprus.529 Chaniot pottery continues to be found in Italy and at Antigori, Sardinia, while Gray wares and locally made Italian wares have been identified in late lev- els at Kommos and Chania. Contemporary Gray wares look like Minyan ware, though dull; they are not very well fired, come in local shapes, and are wheelmade. Similar wares come from Karphi and East Crete.530 Cypriot pottery, especially White Slip II milkbowls, is found at several sites - Knossos, Kom- mos, Zakros, and especially Chania- and Canaanite jars appear at no fewer than 12 sites, produced in both northern and southern Syro-Palestinian and occasionally local Cretan fabrics.531 Little Minoan pottery, however, was exported farther eastward, especially east or south of Cy- prus.532 It is possible, as Banou notes, that the ear- lier "commercial line that had been established in LM I between several sites of E. Crete (Pseira, Zakros and possibly Gournia and Mochlos) and the E. Med- iterranean was no longer a vital vein of com- merce."533 Texts that date to the reign of Ramses III refer to the 12th-century invasions of the Sea Peoples,534 some of whom have been thought to be Minoan, but there is no explicit proof of this. Religion With the disappearance of the Cretan palaces early in IIIB, the exercise of any palatial control over re- ligion vanishes. In the succeeding period, three main types of cult area can be identified: 1) at the borders of ruined centers, where vestiges of structures were still standing (e.g., Kannia, the Shrine of the Double Axes in the east wing at Knossos, the nearby Cara- 527 D.C.

All these are now ev- idently under local control.535 The changes in cult equipment that began in the Final Palatial period become even more pronounced in the later stages of IIIB and C: MGUAs remain the dominant religious statuette, often occurring in mul- tiple examples associated with snakes, horns of con- secration, and the double ax. The MGUA may have replaced, subsumed, or supplemented the deities mentioned in the earlier Linear B texts at Knossos and Chania. At Kavousi Vronda, these figures were made apparently in sets with a backing plaque and a snake tube. The terracotta statues themselves, some approaching 80 cm in height, come from Gazi, west of Herakleion; Kannia in the Mesara; and Karphi and Kavousi, toward the eastern end of the island. The goddess often wears an elaborate tiara with var- ious combinations of elements: poppy seedpods, horns of consecration, or birds. The third locus of cult activity, peaks and caves, shows a resurgence and revival after the Final Pala- tial period, continuing on into the Early Iron Age. The peak sanctuary on Mt. Juktas continued to be used, as well as the open-air sanctuary of Kato Syme. The latter is one of the few places in the Aegean where continuity of cult can be demonstrated be- tween the prehistoric and Archaic periods. After an apparent gap between LM IB and IIIB, the Kophinas peak was reused in IIIC, and a small IIIC settlement was established just outside the sanctuary. It is surely significant that, in IIIC, Crete and the mainland share several religious features: Myce- naean figurines of the phi type536 found around hearths and doorways as at Chania, and the small community bench shrine with terracotta female figurines. But the differences are equally important. The mainland assemblages do not include the snake tubes and backing plaques found on Crete, and the terracotta cylindrical model seems purely Cretan. While the figurines in both locations lift their arms, only the Cretan ones have detailed renderings of the thumbs, and only the Cretan figures wear elab- orate tiaras, in contrast to the simple poloi of the main- land figures. The headgear suggests that these are divine, not human, figures, but it is not clear whether they represent different goddesses or aspects of a single goddess.537 Recent experiments with re-creating some of the Kavousi figurines demonstrate that each large ter- racotta statuette is built of two pot shapes, a jug for the body and a smaller, inverted jug for the head, with facial features, breasts, and arms modeled sep- arately. These figures took at least a day, and prob- ably several, to make. Their technique strongly sug- gests that they were made not by sculptors but rather by local potters, who used the same fabrics in mak- ing local cooking pots and pithoi (the two fabrics required different firing temperatures); perhaps the cult equipment was ordered in sets by individuals or families.538 END OF THE BRONZE AGE IN CRETE The transition from the Late Bronze Age in Crete to Cretan Protogeometric seems to have been effected relatively peacefully: sites continue or are abandoned without major destructions.5"9 Often termed Sub- minoan, material from this period, roughly 1100- 1000/975 B.C., comes mainly from Karphi, Kavousi Vronda, and Vrokastro.

YOUNGER [AJA 102 is known from Knossos, especially the Spring Chamber and from the nearby cemeteries at Zapher Papoura, Ayios loannes, and Fortetsa.540 Several fea- tures characterize the transition to the Early Iron Age: the slow appearance of iron for tools and weap- ons, the increasing frequency of cremation burials and small tholos tombs from early in LM IIIC on, including the reuse of tombs, and the eventual dis- appearance of MGUAs.541 Among the many survivals and revivals, some so- cial customs may have been retained, including as- pects of law, land tenure, herding, and possibly rites of male passage.542 Two examples of continuity are impressive: pictorial vase painting543 and the in- scriptions from East Crete using Greek letters to write "Eteo-Cretan." DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK It should be clear from this survey that the ar- chaeology of Late Bronze Age Crete has changed enormously since its inception just over a century ago. Excavation has far outpaced publication, and a major priority for at least the next decade should be the publication of sites and material. The con- centration on excavating elite architecture needs to be balanced with a more comprehensive presenta- tion of domestic and nonelite architecture, especially for the Final and Postpalatial periods where much of our evidence has come from funerary contexts. For all periods, future excavation should be directed toward establishing the actual limits of a settlement; the precise size of most sites is unknown. A few specific concerns follow. Jewelry must be analyzed in terms of typology, context, technique, and representations before it can be incorporated into analyses of Minoan society and be appreciated as a social artifact. Important advances are taking place in the study of Minoan pottery, particularly for the Final and Postpalatial periods, but for all periods the study of pottery needs to be integrated more thoroughly with analyses of architectural and demographic change. The groundwork for the study of Minoan seals and sealings has been laid, but non- specialist scholars generally have not made use of these artifacts as yet. A new book on Minoan archi- tecture is needed, integrating the architectural evidence - materials, techniques, and the buildings themselves--with theoretical models for building a cognitive plan of Minoan space. Despite several sur- veys of Minoan larnakes, the painted larnakes are today largely unstudied; a comprehensive catalogue of these could greatly increase our understanding of Late Minoan society. Finally, life on Crete has been revolutionized, for better or for worse, in just the last three generations. Not only will the archaeological heritage of Crete 540J.N.

Careful efforts must be made now not only to record it but also to retrieve it through academic studies of daily living: animal and plant husbandry, pharmacopiae, customs, and traditions. Much atten- tion has been devoted in recent decades to major theoretical constructs of politics, state theory, and the state of the profession. One of the consequences is that the lived life of individuals has all but been neglected.544 We should want to know more about the Minoans themselves, for if ever there was a goal of archaeology, it is the study of people, especially at the commonest level.
