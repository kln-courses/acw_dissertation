<plain_text><page sequence="1">The exaltation of Nabu A revision of the relief depicting the battle against Tiamat from the temple of Bel in Palmyra By Lucinda Dirven, Leiden Introduction A well known relief that once decorated the peristyle of the temple of Bel in Palmyra depicts the battle of a deity on a chariot and a deity rid ing a horse with an ophidian monster.1) It is among the best known reliefs from Palmyra and for obvious reasons. Not only is it a work of high quality and craftsmanship, it is also one of the rare instances that provides an insight into the mythology that formed the basis of the cult at Palmyra. As is well known, the literary sources from Palmyra are si lent in this respect. Starting with Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, specia lists in the art and religion of Palmyra have identified the scene as the battle of Bel and Tiamat, an episode from Enuma elish, the Babylonian epic of creation.2) Although the proposed interpretation can explain 1) I am greatly indebted to professor K.van der Toorn (Leiden University), for his assistance with the Babylonian material and his comments on earlier drafts of this article, and to professor E.Will (Paris), and professor H.Drijvers (Groningen Uni versity), for their comments and suggestions. It goes without saying that responsibil ity for the views expressed here lies solely by its author. H.

This holds true especially for the identity of the represented deities and their relationship with Bel and his cult.3) The present contribution seeks to demonstrate that these enigmas result from an erroneous interpretation of the main protagonist of the scene. It will be argued that Nabu in stead of Bel is the leading figure of the Palmyrene relief and that the attending figures are related to his cult. The battle scene and the cult of Bel. The current interpretation First I shall give a description of the relief (cf. p. 98). When found in 1934 it consisted of nine fragments. The left part of the relief is now lost, but we may rely on the detailed description offered by Seyrig in its first publication.4) The now missing fragments pictured a god clad in military costume, riding a chariot drawn by at least one horse. He car ries a bow and is about to shoot an arrow at a monster shown in front of him. This hideous creature has a woman's body and legs consisting of several snakes. Hidden between them is a small naked figure. To the right of the monster's head a crater is depicted from which four or five snakes arise. A warrior riding a horse advances towards the monster from the right. Like the figure riding the chariot he wears a military costume. Due to the damage to the relief, his weapons are no longer discernible. Below the front legs of his horse a small dog runs towards the monster. of an earlier view, expressed in Tesseres, 247-251, where he argues for a combina tion of the Greek myth of Zeus and Typhon and the Babylonian battle of Marduk and Tiamat). Du Mesnil du Buisson's interpretation is followed by Drijvers, Edessa, 64-65; Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2614-2615. 3) Thus Du Mesnil du Buisson, 'Combat de Bel contre Tiamat,' 86; Seyrig, Tem ple de Bel, 88; Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2615. 4) Seyrig, 'Bas-reliefs monumentaux,' 165-173, pi. XX and XXIV; Idem, Temple de Bel, 87. Starcky and Gawlikowski, Palmyre, 92, argue that these fragments are no part of the relief because their dimensions do not match the other fragements. Unfor tunately they do not substantiate their claim. In a more recent article 'Dieux de Pal myre,' 2615, Gawlikowski does consider the fragments to be part of the battle scene. In view of the deficient information provided by the afore mentioned publication, I follow Gawlikowski's most recent description. The question whether the fragments belong to the 'battle relief or not, is of little consequence for the interpretation pro posed in this article. The mounted warrior is still to be identified as Nabu; the identi fication of this deity as Bel is unlikely since Iarhibol and Aglibol are not among the attendant gods (cf. below, p. 108). Moreover, the other reliefs on the beams are related to other Palmyrene sanctuaries. Therefore the relation of this relief with the temple of Bel itself would be unusual.</page><page sequence="3">98 Lucinda Dirven LES POUTRES DU PERISTYLE O 1_2m Fig.: Beam A, side b. After Seyrig, Temple de Bel, Album 90 To the right of the battle scene six figures are depicted standing in a row. All are pictured in a frontal position, in the hieratic posture so ty pical of the art of Palmyra. The first four figures are dressed in military outfits, wearing a helmet and cuirass. The figure closest to the mounted warrior carries a spear in his right hand. A snake is coiled around this spear. The deity next to him wears a short tunic over the cuirass, from which may be deduced that this is a goddess.5) In her right hand she carries a spear, on her left shoulder rests a bow. To the right of her feet a fish is depicted, moving towards a second fish, depicted between the legs of the third military figure who holds a spear in his left hand. A similar weapon is held by the fourth and last warrior god, who carries a small round shield as well. On his left stands the figure of a man lean ing on a club; Except for the lion skin draped over his left shoulder this figure is naked. The hem of a long robe is all that remains of the sixth and last figure. From this garment it can be deduced that we are deal ing with a female figure here, clad in a Greek dress. The relief decorated one of the beams that originally supported the peristyle of the temple of Bel, the centre of religious life in Palmyra.6) According to a famous inscription the northern adyton was consecrated on the sixth of Nisan (= March/April) of the year 32 CE to Bel, Iarhi 5) This military outfit is typical of the iconography of female deities, for example of Allat-Athena. Hence the doubt expressed by Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2641-2642, about her female sex is groundless. 6) Seyrig, Temple de Bel, for the most extensive discussion of the temple.</page><page sequence="4">The exaltation of Nabu 99 bol and Aglibol.7) The reliefs of the peristyle are to be dated later, around 80 CE.8) The dedication of the new temple to Bel, Iarhibol and Aglibol on the sixth of Nisan provided the point of departure for the current interpretation of this scene. Bel, the tutelary deity of the sanctuary, covers an autochthonous deity originally called Bol.9) His name was changed into Bel in imita tion of Marduk-Bel, the Lord of the Babylonian pantheon.10) The in fluence of Babylon upon Palmyra's religion went beyond the mere adoption of a name; it affected the cult of Bol/Bel as well. This is ap parent from the consecration of his temple on the sixth of Nisan. This date coincides with the Babylonian Akitu festival, that was celebrated in Babylonia from the fourth until the twelfth day of the month Nisan and hailed Marduk-Bel as the King of the gods. In Babylonia it had been customary to dedicate or rededicate temples during the Akitu fes 7) Inv. IX, 1: 'In the month Tisri of the year 357 (October 45 CE). This statue is of Lisams the son of Taibbol, the son of Sokaibel, of the Bene Komare, who dedi cated the temple (hykP) to Bel, Iarhibol and Aglibol, the gods, during their festival, on the sixth day of Nisan of the year 343 (April 32 CE), [this statue] was erected for him by his sons in his honour.' The translation of bqdswhy, 'during their festival' was proposed by M.Gawlikows ki, Le temple palmyrenien. Etude d'epigraphie et de topographie historique, (Pal myre VI, Warszwa 1973), 68. 8) The date of the reliefs is intimately connected with the building history of the sanctuary. At first it was assumed that the temple was completed when dedicated in 32 CE. Recently Pietrzykowski cinvincingly pointed out that its construction covers about a century (from 17-116 CE): Adyta Swigtyn Palmyrenskich. With a french summary by M.Gawlikowski, 'Les adytons des temples palmyreniens. Forme et fonctions' (Warszawa 1997), 119-134, esp. 132-133. 9) This is deduced from the names of the autochthonous Palmyrene deities Iarhi bol and Aglibol, as well as the great many personal names that contain the element Bol: Seyrig, Temple de Bel, 228; J. T. Milik, Dedicaces faites par des dieux (Palmyre, Hatra, Tyr) et des thiases semitiques a l'epoque romaine, (Paris 1972), 36. Bol is in all probability a contracted form of Ba'al and as such an indication for a West-Semitic layer in Palmyra's religion. Cf: Gawlikowski, Temple, 63. 10) When exactly this change occurred is not clear. A terminus post quern is pro vided by the oldest datable inscription from Palmyra, Inv. XI 100, dated in the year 44 CE, that commemorates the dedication of a statue by the priests of Bel. According to Polybius, V 79, 8; 82, 12, a man by the name of Zabdibelos was in command of a group of 10.000 Arabic archers in the army of Antiochus III during the battle at Ra phia In 217 BCE. Zabdibelos ('gift of Bel'), is a typical Palmyrene name, and thus provides a strong indication for the worship of Bel in the oasis in the Seleucid period. The worship of Bel in Palmyra may even go as far back as Achaemenidian times, given the strong cultural influence of Mesopotamia on the Syrian region in this peri od. The evidence to this respect is listed by Drijvers, Edessa, 54-56. Given the lack of sources on Palmyrene religion before the common era, it can no longer be estab lished whether its religion was directly influenced by Babylon, or whether the Baby lonian concepts reached the city via Assyria.</page><page sequence="5">100 Lucinda Dirven tival.11) The fact that this tradition was also observed in Palmyra indi cates that the festival was still celebrated here. This is substantiated by a tessera that gave access to a sacred meal celebrated in Bel's honour on the occasion of the New Year.12) More generally, Jean Cantineau pointed out the large number of Palmyrene inscriptions dated in Nisan - a fact which he connects with the Akitu festival.13) Considering the Babylonian background of Palmyra's main deity, it may safely be con cluded that at the beginning of the common era, Palmyra still cele brated the Akitu festival. Palmyra was not the only city in the region that had adopted the Babylonian festival; we know that it was also celebrated in Assur and Edessa during the first centuries of the com mon era.14) Given the cultural continuity in the region, modern scholars have used the liturgy of the Akitu festival as an explanatory key to the scene. During the celebration of the festival in Babylon parts of Enuma elish were sung, the Babylonian creation myth that was designed to establish Marduk as King of the gods.15) In this epic Marduk is heralded as the creator and ruler of the universe, to whom all cosmic phenomena are subject. It relates how Marduk was given power over mankind by Anu and Enlil, overcame the chaos monster Tiamat and thus created the or dered human world and the cosmos.16) n) See P.Beaulieu, The Reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon 556-539 B.C., (New Haven 1989), 9-10. 12) H.Ingholt, H.

Cf. below note 73, for further references. The lasting popularity of the festival in Assur is apparent from a number of Aramaic inscriptions found in the north-western iwan of the Parthian building constructed above the former temple of Assur. They date from the early third century CE and are dedicated to Assur and his spouse Serua. The ma jority of the dated texts were written in the period between 8 and 11 Nisan over a number of years: B.Aggoula, Inscriptions et graffites arameens d'Assur, (Napoli 1985), nos. 17a and 29k (8 Nisan), nos.25b and 29i (9 Nisan), nos.27b, 29b and 29h (10 Nisan), nos. 17b, 20, 23c, 25e, and 28 (11 Nisan).

The god armed with the bow and riding the chariot recalls the description of Marduk-Bel carrying his flood weapon, riding the storm chariot drawn by four fierce horses. Like Tiamat in the Babylonian epic, the monster depicted on the Palmyrene relief is of the female sex. Despite these similarities, it is not an exact rendering of the Babylonian myth. On the Palmyrene relief Bel's chariot is drawn by one instead of four horses and Tiamat is represented with snake tailed legs, whereas the Babylonian epic is si lent in this respect.17) The small figure entangled between Tiamat's 'legs' and the crater filled with snakes are not described in the Babylo nian epic either.18) These differences are readily explained by the fact that the Babylonian epic and the Palmyrene relief are separated by more than a thousand years. The general picture corresponds with the event described in Enuma elish to such an extent that the differences do not interfere with the identification of this scene as the combat be tween Marduk-Bel and Tiamat. However, the battle of Bel and Tiamat forms only a small part of the overall scene. The largest part of the relief is devoted to seven deities. 17) Although in some respects the epic describes Tiamat in anthropomorphic terms, it is difficult to arrive at a precise picture of her. Some passages suggest that she was a kind of sea creature ('the salt waters were inside here'). This accords well with her name, which is derived from the word 'tiamtum^ 'sea.' In the fourth century BCE, Berossus still refers to the Greek word 'thalassa,' 'sea,' in order to explain her name. The creature on the Palmyrene relief definitely alludes to a sea monster. Although her legs consist of snakes, she reminds us of a giant octopus. We do not know whether this motif was a Babylonian device, or originated in Greek iconogra phy. Cf.: B. Alster, 'Tiamat,' Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible, (ed. K.van der Toorn, B. Becking and P.W. van der Horst, Leiden 1995), cols. 1634 1639; J. Black and A.Green, 'Tiamat,' Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Meso potamia. An Illustrated Dictionary, (London 1992), 177; S. M. Burstein, The 'Babylo nica' of Berossus, (SANE 1.5, Malibu 1978), 14. 18) Perhaps the snakes symbolise Tiamat's creatures, described in the epic, tablet II. I am unable to find an explanation for the small figure between the snake tailed legs of the monster. Perhaps he is Tiamat's lover, Qingu. However, the figure looks more like her victim than her belligerent admirer. It is more likely that his presence is due to a Palmyrene interpretation of the myth. A similar figure, but dressed, is de picted beneath the feet of the goddess on a famous Palmyrene relief, figuring a god dess with a dog. This is not the only similarity with the relief from the temple of Bel, for the dog figures on the battle scene as well. Interestingly, the relief of 'the goddess with the dog,' was found in the proximity of the temple of Nabu. Given the promi nent role of Nabu in the battle-relief, discussed below, it is tempting to relate these motifs to the cult of this god. However, tantalising though these similarities are, the evidence is too fragmentary to arrive at a conclusion. For a recent discussion of the relief see: E.Will, 'La deesse au chien de Palmyre,' Syria 62 (1985), 49-55, and idem, 'La deesse au chien de Palmyre: note additionelle,' Syria 64 (1986), 383-384.</page><page sequence="7">102 Lucinda Dirven Most conspicuous is the warrior on the horse, who actively participates in the combat and appears to be as important as Bel himself. Enuma elish does not mention any attendant deities. The slaying of Tiamat is emphatically described as a personal achievement of Marduk, for this exemplifies and justifies his supremacy. The attendant deities do not tally with the description in Enuma elish, which renders the identifica tion of the scene as the battle of Bel and Tiamat problematic. Henry Seyrig has therefore rightly pointed out that the scene of this relief remains enigmatic as long as the presence of the other deities is un explained.19) Advocates of the hypothesis that the relief represents an event from Enuma elish have pointed out the local character of the myth in order to explain the differences mentioned above. Although this seems to be a probable explanation, it does not contribute to the interpretation of the relief. To be valuable, it has to be explained why and how these lo cal versions came into being. In order to grasp the dynamics of the myth, we have to return to the celebration of the Akitu festival. After all, it was the consecration of the temple of Bel on the sixth of Nisan that triggered off the explanation of the relief. The epic of creation did not stand by itself, but was part of the New Year festival. In other words, there is a ritual connection between Enuma elish and the Akitu festival.20) The Akitu festival fulfilled several functions and therefore was susceptible to change. Since Enuma elish was part of its rituals it may be assumed that its interpretation changed as well. In order to grasp the dynamics of the myth it is necessary to dwell upon the multi ple meanings of the festival; its history and expansion. The Akitu festival. History and dynamics The Akitu festival is best known as celebrated in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II.21) Like elsewhere in the country, the festi val in Babylon celebrated the supremacy of its city-god. As it concerned 19) Seyrig, Temple de Bel, 88. 20) The entire epic of creation was recited in the night of the fourth onto the fifth of Nisan: C. Cagirgan, The Babylonian Festivals, (Ph. D.Birmingham 1976), 20-21, 273-278; Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia, 231. Possibly parts of the epic were re cited on the other days of the Akitu festival as well: W.G.Lambert, 'The Great Battle of the Mesopotamian Religious Year. The Conflict in the Akitu House,' Iraq 25 (1963), 189-190, esp. 189. 21) For a description of the ritual as celebrated in Babylon in the days of Nebu chadnezzar II see the recent studies by J. A. Black, 'The New Year Ceremonies in Ancient Babylon: "Taking Bel by the Hand" and a Cultic Picnic,' Religion 11 (1981), 39-59; A.Kuhrt, 'Usurpation, conquest and ceremonial: from Babylon to</page><page sequence="8">The exaltation of Nabu 103 the city-god of the capital, the festival came to play a major role in the Babylonian state religion and underlines the close ties between the hu man ruler and the national deity. The ritual procedures of the festival reflect and reaffirm Marduk's position as head of the Babylonian pantheon. This is expressed most clearly on Nisan the eight, when the various city-gods of the kingdom assemble in Esagil to hail Marduk as their King. The assembly of Mesopotamian deities in Esagil is the ritual expression of the concluding part of Enuma elish, in which the assem bly of gods sing praise of Marduk and proclaim his fifty names.22) The ritual procedures during the festival reflect the religious hierar chy in the country. In Esagil the gods are lined up according to their status and when they leave in procession for the Akitu chapel outside the city, the procession visualizes the hierarchy of the Babylonian pantheon for the crowd assembled along the road.23) By the middle of the first millennium BCE Marduk's son Nabu played a prominent role in the festival. This god of Borsippa was intimately related to his father Marduk in Babylon, which is expressed by the rituals.24) The Neo Ba bylonian festival proclaimed Marduk as the King of the gods and her alded Nabu as his legitimate successor. To the Babylonian kings, the festival was a golden opportunity to win popular support for their rule. Prior to the procession to the Akitu chapel, the king had been ritually re-appointed by Marduk and could thus claim the divine approval of his rule.25) During the procession the king played a leading role.

Though Mar duk-Bel is in the limelight of the Babylonian New Year festival, the Neo-Babylonian Kings received their divine mandate from his son, Nabu. The role of the latter deity in the royal ideology of the Neo-Ba bylonian period is frequently underrated. However, the fact that the king received the sceptre of kingship out of the hands of Nabu, and then made his way to Babylon in the company of this god, indicates that Nabu acted as a tutelary deity for the king.26) This role explains why his name is so of regular a theophoric element in Babylonian royal names from the 8th to 6th centuries BCE (e.g., Nabu-suma-iskun, Nabu-nasir, Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, Nabonidus). In Neo-Ba bylonian times, the Nabu temple was a privileged place of intercession for the king.27) The power of the Akitu festival as an instrument of religious-political propaganda contributed to its wide dissemination and lasting popular ity. Like the Babylonian Kings, the Assyrian, Persian and Seleucid ru lers readily grasped the political possibilities of the festival. The Assyr ian King Sennacherib (704-681 BCE) introduced the festival in Assur and thereby played an important role in its distribution through north ern Mesopotamia.28) When the Achaemenid King Cyrus entered the city of Babylon in 539 BCE he paid homage to Bel and Nabu.29) Even the Seleucid rulers had recourse to this time honoured festival in order to win the support of the Babylonian population.30) 26) Van der Toorn, 'Babylonische Nieuwjaarsfeest,' 19. 27) V.Scheil, 'Catalogue de la collection Eugene Tisserand,' RA 18 (1921), 1-33, esp. 30-31 no. 21.

Can nadine and S.Price, Cambridge 1987), 20-55. 30) When it comes to the participation of the Seleucid Kings in the Akitu festival, two texts stand at our disposal. The earliest witness is a fragmentary chronicle con cerning the reign of Seleucus III, which shows that the 8th of Nisan was still a major liturgical date in 224 BCE. On that day, the 'ritual for Seleucus, the King, and his sons' was to be performed: A.K.Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, (Lo cust Valley 1975), 283-284, Chronicle 13b.

A new Approach to the</page><page sequence="10">The exaltation of Nabu 105 The festival was not only a major event in Babylonian state religion; it held a large place in the hearts of the population as well. In a sense its political use was secondary: the rulers used a long-standing and widespread festival in ideological support of their rule. The celebration of this festival was not confined to Babylon or Assur, but was cele brated all over Mesopotamia, from Uruk in the south up to Harran in the north. Eventually it also reached Syria, in all probability from the north of Mesopotamia. Throughout the country it was primarily a local festival; it was the festival of the city, or the festival of the city god. Its popular appeal explains why the festival did not fall into oblivion after the Seleucid period, and continued to be celebrated until at least the third century CE, and probably quite some time after. The above illustrates the wide dissemination and long lasting popu larity of the originally Babylonian festival. However, it also shows that it functioned in different times and contexts. From a functional point of view, the festival was designed to express and confirm the religious and/or political status quo. It represented current ideas, turned into re ligious practice. This implies that the festival was dynamic and was adapted to the circumstances. At times the festival even played a major role in attempts to bring about religious change.31) Like the festival, Enuma elish was a myth of legitimization, designed to position Marduk as the foremost of the gods.32) As such it is the expression of a religious change brought about by the end of the second millennium BCE. Although the Akitu festival is older and has several independent di mensions, Enuma elish gives expression to the same basic issues and Seleucid Empire, (London 1993), 130-131. The second text mentioning a Seleucid King in connection with the Akitu festival is a recently published astronomical diary from 204 BCE, from which can be inferred that the Seleucid King Antiochus III per sonally participated in the festival: A.J.Sachs and H.Hunger, Astronomical Diaries and related texts from Babylonia, Vol.2 (Vienna 1989), 202-203; S.Sherwin-White, 'Seleucid Babylonia: a case-study for the installation and development of Greek rule,'Hellenism in the East, (ed. A. Kuhrt and S.Sherwin-White, Berkeley 1987), 1-31. 31) As was the case with Sennacherib, who installed the Akitu festival in order to herald the supremacy of Assur. 32) In the course of the last 60-70 years various dates were proposed for Enuma elish. At present, the majority of scholars agree with the view of W. G. Lambert, 'The Reign of Nebukadnezzar I: A Turning Point in the History of Ancient Mesopotamian Religion,' The Seed of Wisdom: Essays ... T.J. Meek, (ed. W. S. McCullough, Toron to 1964), 3-13, according to whom the epic was composed during the reign of Nebu chadnezzar I (1125-1104 BCE), when Marduk was first publicly articulated as the head of the Babylonian pantheon. For a summary of this discussion, as well as a pro position for a later date see T.Abusch, 'Marduk,' Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible, (ed. K.van der Toorn, B. Becking and P. W.van der Horst, Leiden 1995), cols. 1014-1026.</page><page sequence="11">106 Lucinda Dirven narrative themes as the festival. Several of the events described in the epic allude to ritual enactments of the Akitu festival as celebrated in Babylon by the end of the second millennium BCE. However, the epic was part of the practice of a living religion, and hence its interpretation and contents changed. An illustrative example of the adaptation of both the Akitu festival and Enuma elish to local circumstances is provided by a scene on a set of doors donated by the Assyrian King Sennacherib to the Akitu house of Assur. These doors have not been preserved, but their decoration is described in an inscription that commemorates their foundation.33) They pictured Assyria's national deity Assur advancing in his chariot in order to battle against Tiamat. Assur is escorted by ten gods that pre cede his chariot and fifteen that follow. Like Assur, his companions are Assyrian deities; thereby making the scene a local adaptation of the Ba bylonian epic of creation. A slightly broken list of the same gods occurs on a late Assyrian ritual fragment which describes them as preceding Assur to the Akitu house.34) Other lists describing the procession to the Akitu house in Assur distinguish between deities heading Assur's char iot and deities that follow.35) All these deities are worshipped in the city of Assur and their position in the procession reflects their position in the local pantheon; the deities preceding Assur are less important than the ones that follow. The assisting deities on the doors thus result from their participation in the Akitu procession. This exemplifies the influence of the rituals upon the visualization of the myth.36) The battle scene and the cult of Bel. A reevaluation By analogy with the representation in Assur we may suppose that the Palmyrene relief illustrates a local adaptation of the Akitu myth, figur ing Bel and several Palmyrene deities who played a part in the celebra tion of the Palmyrene Akitu festival. If so, it is to be expected that the attendant deities are related to the cult of Bel. Unfortunately the attri butes of the attending deities do not fully substantiate their identifica tion. The deity riding the horse, Bel's most important assistant, carries no attributes by means of which he can be identified. Perhaps he is es 33) D.

The bow she carries is an attribute usually asso ciated with the Greek goddess Artemis. However, in Palmyra Artemis is identified both with the Babylonian goddess Nanaia as well as with the Arab deity Allat, and consequently she may represent either of them.39) If the fish depicted to the left of this goddess is her attribute, we have to reckon with a third possibility: the goddess Atargatis.40) The god to her left has been identified as the son of Atargatis-Derceto, Poseidon or Ichthys, due to the fish depicted between his legs. How ever, there are no Palmyrene representations that substantiate this iden tifications and therefore it is better to leave the identification unde cided. The god next to him is perhaps to be identified with the Arab god Arsu, since this deity is frequently depicted with the small round shield which is typical for deities of the desert.41) The god equipped with the club and lion skin clearly figures Heracles, identified in Pal myra with the Babylonian deity Nergal.42) Too little remains of the last 37) The dog is associated in Palmyra with a goddess, cf. above, note 18. 38) As such identified on a Palmyrene relief dated in 55 CE: J. Starcky, 'Autour d'une dedicace palmyrenienne a Sadrafa et a Du'anat,' Syria 26 (1949), 43-85, fig. 2; Drijvers, Religion of Palmyra, pl.XLVIII. For a general discussion of this deity and further references see: Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2646-2647. 39) The identification of Artemis with Nanaia is based upon the iconography of this goddess on Palmyrene tesserae. RTP no. 285 depicts two standing deities, identi fied by the accompanying inscriptions as SKNY, 'Saknai,' and NNY, 'Nanaia,' SVT BBL, 'assistants of Babylon.' The goddess identified as Artemis is represented as a young woman, wearing a short double chiton. In her left hand she holds a bow, with her right hand she reaches out to pull an arrow from the quiver, visible behind her shoulder. Apart from the chignon and the calathos, this goddess looks exactly like the Greek goddess Artemis. A similar goddess is depicted on RTP no. 310 with Apollo citharoedus. In Palmyra Apollo was identified as Nabu (cf. RTP nos. 302 and 119), thus RTP no. 310 represents the couple Nabu and Nanaia. The interpretatio graeca of Nabu and Nanaia as Apollo and Artemis is already made by Strabo, Geogr. XI 1.7. Allat is identified with Artemis in a Greek inscription from the year 6 BCE, on an altar from the temple of Allat: H.J. W. Drijvers, 'De matre inter leones sedente. Icono graphy and Character of the Arab Goddess Allat,' Homages a Maarten J. Vermaseren I, (EPRO 68, Leiden 1978), 331-351, esp. 340, pi. LXXV. 40) Proposed by Drijvers, 'De matre inter leones,' 347. 41) For the iconography of this god compare P. Linant de Bellefonds, 'Arsu,' LIMC II. 1, (Zurich, Munchen 1984), 615-618. In addition to the material assembled here, a relief figuring Arsu and Iarhibol was recently found in the temple of Allat: E.Ruprechtsberger (ed.), Palmyra: Geschichte, Kunst und Kultur der Oasenstadt, (Linz 1987), 310, no. 32. 42) Heracles is attested in Palmyra as early as the first century BCE, the period</page><page sequence="13">108 Lucinda Dirven goddess to arrive at an identification; several Palmyrene goddesses are depicted wearing a long Greek dress. Despite the fact that the majority of the attending deities cannot be identified with certainty it is clear that they are not the deities usually associated with Bel in his cult. Most conspicuous is the absence of Bel's most important associates, the sun god Iarhibol and the moon god Agli bol. After all, the new temple was not only dedicated to Bel, but to Iar hibol and Aglibol as well.43) From an iconographical point of view the deity riding the horse seems as important as Bel himself. The fact that in Palmyra the sun god Iarhibol is the most important deity after Bel, gives us reason to suppose that the mounted warrior is to be identified as Iarhibol.44) However, the absence of the radiant nimbus that invari ably accompanies representations of Iarhibol, as well as the fact that his companion Aglibol is not present among the other deities, make this identification highly unlikely.45) Although the relief figures Palmyra's civic deity in a local version of Enuma elish, the attending deities are not compatible with the cult of this deity in his temple.46) The problem is solved if we suppose that not Bel but the deity riding the horse is the leading figure in this relief. The probability of this hypothesis is augmented by two other reliefs that de corated the peristyle of Bel's temple. Both are not related to the temple of Bel but to other sanctuaries in Palmyra. The back of the beam por traying the battle scene, pictures the deities Aglibol and Malakbel in during which the city was oriented towards the East. He figures on an archaic relief found in the so-called 'foundation V in the court of Bel's temple: H. Seyrig, 'Hera cles-Nergal,' Syria 24 (1944/45), 62-80; S.B.Downey, The Heracles Sculpture, (The Excavations at Dura-Europos. Final report III.I.l, New Haven 1969), 77-80. 43) Compare above, note 7. On the importance of Iarhibol and Aglibol in the cult of Bel see Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2616-2621 and 2625. 44) Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2616-2617. 45) Du Mesnil du Buisson, 'Combat de Bel contre Tiamat,' 90 and fig. 1, proposes to identify this deity as Iarhibol. However, as he notes in the same article on p. 85, the iconography of this deity is incompatible with Iarhibol. Alternatively, he suggests to identify this deity as Azizu; Tesseres, 192-193. For the iconography of Iarhibol see: P.Linant de Bellefonds, 'Iarhibol,' LIMC V. 1, (Zurich, Munchen 1990), 624-626. 46) Already noted by Du Mesnil du Buisson, 'Combat de Bel contre Tiamat,' 86; Seyrig, Temple de Bel, 88. Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2615, proposes to see the relief as a reflection of the former hierarchy in the sanctuary. However, the group of deities does not fit with the deities associated with Bel in his old temple either. Although little information is available on this period, it is clear that Iarhibol was already associated with Bel before the common era. This may be inferred from the Palmyrene dedication of a temple {hykP) to Bel and Iarhibol in Dura-Europos in 32 BCE: R.du Mesnil du Buisson, Inventaire des inscriptions palmyreniennes de Doura-Europos (32 avant J.-C. a 256 apres J.-C), (nouvelle edition, Paris 1939), 3-4, no.l.</page><page sequence="14">The exaltation of Nabu 109 their sanctuary, that is called the Holy Wood in Palmyrene inscrip tions.47) This sanctuary was administered by the Bene Komare and was one of the most important tribal sanctuaries in the city of Palmyra.48) Facing is the battle scene a relief figuring a procession with a camel. The character of this event is distinctively Arabic and pictures a reli gious procession, which probably concerns the foundation of a sanc tuary.49) Until very recently the exact meaning of this relief was ob scure.50) A new light is thrown on its interpretation by the recent dis covery in the temple of Allat of a fragmentary relief that depicts a more or less identical scene.51) The relief found in the temple of Allat is older than the relief in the temple of Bel, for it is made of soft yellow lime stone, typical of Palmyrene sculpture from the first century BCE and the beginning of the first century CE. The Arabic character of the pro cession fits well with the origin of this goddess and her adherents. In all probability the relief pictures the foundation of Allat's sanctuary and the installation of her cult statue half way the first century BCE.52) 47) Seyrig, 'Bas-reliefs monumentaux,' 173-178, pi.XII; Idem, 'Iconographie de Malakbel,' Syria 18 (1937), 198-209, esp. 201; J.Wais, 'Problemy ikonografii Malakbela,' Studia Palmyrenskie 4 (Warsawa 1970), 5-67, esp. 14, fig. 10; Drijvers, Religion of Palmyra, 10, pi.

In Temple de Bel, 89, the same author opts for the foundation of the sanctuary of Arsu. He sub stantiates his interpretation with a reference to Schlumberger, 'Quatre tribus,' 129 131. However, the latter interprets the event as the foundation of the sanctuary of Bel by the four tribes. Gawlikowski, 'Dieux de Palmyre,' 2651, interprets the event as an Arabic procession related to the temple of Bel. 51) Ruprechtsberger, Palmyra, 314, no. 37. 52) The same interpretation is proposed by the excavators of Allat's sanctuary, and will be published shortly in the excavation report of this temple. For the date of the sanctuary of Allat see: M.Gawlikowski, 'Le premier temple d'Allat a Palmyre,' Ak</page><page sequence="15">110 Lucinda Dirven We may therefore conclude that the relief in the temple of Bel copies a historical event closely connected with the cult of Allat. Like the temple of Aglibol and Malakbel, the sanctuary of Allat is listed as one of the most important tribal sanctuaries in Palmyra.53) Two of the reliefs from the peristyle of the temple of Bel represent the tutelary deities of other prominent Palmyrene sanctuaries. The de ities attending the battle of Bel and Tiamat do not fit in with the cult of Bel, which gives us reason to suspect that this relief also refers to an important sanctuary in the city. The cavalryman plays the leading part in the battle scene and it is therefore most plausible to suppose that he was the tutelary deity of this sanctuary. It follows from the setting and subject of the relief that this deity was closely connected with Bel, and played an important role in the Palmyrene version of the Akitu festival. Unfortunately the sources are next to silent with respect to the Palmyr ene festival. A discussion of the religious situation in Babylonia will therefore serve as the point of departure in the search for his identity. Subsequently a comparison will be made with the religious situation in Palmyra. ten des XIII. internationalen Kongresses fiir klassische Archaologie, Berlin 1988, (Mainz am Rhein 1990), 362. The left part of the relief from the temple of Bel is heavily damaged but seems to picture a cult statue of some sort. This identification is confirmed by the relief from the temple of Allat referred to above, the reverse side of which figures a cult statue on a wagon, cf. the description offered by Ruprechtsberger, Palmyra, 314, no. 37. Sculptures of Palmyra I (ed. K.Tanabe, Memoirs of the Ancient Orient Museum vol.1, Tokyo 1986), pi. 155. A reference to the installation of Allat's cult statue is made in an inscription found in the proximity of her temple: M.Gawlikowski, Re cueil descriptions palmyreniennes provenant de fouilles syriennes et polonaises re centes a Palmyre, (Extraits des memoires presentes par divers savants a l'academie des inscriptions et belles-lettres XVI, Paris 1974), 72-73, no. 143 (henceforth abbre viated as RSP). It is a dedication of an altar by a certain Gaddarsu to the Lady of the temple (= Allat) dated 115 CE. The dedicant refers to his ancestor, Mattanai son of Qainu Baratai the Great, who erected the idol {mstf) of the Lady of the temple. This Mattanai must have lived around the middle of the first century BCE, for he figures as the great-grandfather in the funerary inscription of Wahballat, dated in 11 CE, from the tomb below the temple of Baalshamin: Dunant, Sanctuaire de Baalshamin, 25-26, no. 11. For the reconstruction of the genealogy of RSP 143 see: K.Dijkstra, Life and Loyalty. A Study in the Socio- Religious Culture of Syria and Mesopotamia in the Graeco-Roman Period based on Epigraphical Evidence, (Leiden 1995), 123 124. 53) The sanctuary is listed as one of the four sanctuaries in the inscription dated in 145 CE that was found in her temple: Drijvers, 'Greek and Aramaic Inscriptions,' 34-38, pi. 2. Interestingly, the sanctuary of Allat is mentioned here instead of the temple of Baalshamin. The four sanctuaries are in all probability related to the four tribes that formed the political body of Palmyra, hence both sanctuaries were prob ably administered by the same tribe, i. e. the Bene Ma'azin.</page><page sequence="16">The exaltation of Nabu 111 Nabu and the Akitu festival A Babylonian deity intimately related with Marduk who played a prominent role in the Babylonian Akitu festival is the god Nabu. In the course of Mesopotamian history Nabu developed from a comparatively unimportant god into one of the most prominent Babylonian deities.54) In the Old Babylonian period he was a fairly insignificant deity and be longed to the circle of Marduk in Babylon.55) In this period Nabu first and foremost was a divine scribe, who was considered to be Marduk's minister and was lodged in his temple Esagil.56) From the end of the Cassite period onwards Nabu is heralded as Marduk's son. In imitation of his father he becomes a god of divine wisdom.57) Nabu's growing im portance during this period can be deduced from the cult in Ezida at Borsippa where he gradually supplanted his father Marduk. At the be ginning of the first millennium he replaced his father and became the city god of Borsippa.58) His eminent position is also apparent from the high standing of his newly acquired spouse. Nabu was worshipped in Ezida with Nanaia, the old and powerful goddess from Uruk.59) Not long before the rise of the Late Babylonian Empire, Nabu had reached a position equal to his father's. Nabu hymns on Neo-Babylo nian cylinder seals celebrate the god as "lord of the gods" and "King of 54) F. Pomponio, Nabu. II culto e la figura di un dio del pantheon babilonesi ed assiro.

W.G.Lambert, 'Divine Love Lyrics from the reign of Abi-esuh,' MIO 12 (1966), 44. 57) The oldest instance in which Nabu is being referred to as Marduk's son dates from the end of the Cassic period: Pomponio, Nabu, 49-50. However, most exam ples date from the first millennium: Idem, 161-162. On Nabu as a god of divine wis dom: Idem, 183 and 243-244. 58) During the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1069-1048 BCE). Cf. Pomponio, Na bu, 64. 59) Lambert, 'Divine Love Lyrics,' 44; E.Matsushima, 'Problemes des deesses Tasmetum et Nanaia,' Orient 16 (1980), 133; Pomponio, Nabu, 169. Other docu ments mention the goddess Tasmetu as Nabu's spouse. In the Old-Babylonian period Nanaia and Tasmetu were different goddesses. This follows from the Old Babylonian god list AO 5376, that provided the basis for the Middle- and Late Assyrian editions of AN = Anum. Here Nabu and Tasmetu appear together close to Marduk and his group at the end of the Ea section (TCL pi. XXVI 7-14). Nanaia and Muati appear much later in the same list, immediately after the Tammuz section (TCL pi. XXV 34 37). However, in first millennium texts their relationship is far less clear, cf: Mat sushima, 'Problemes des deesses,' 133-148 and A. R.George, 'A Neo-Assyrian Lit erary Text,' State Archives of Assyria Bulletin 1 (1987), 31-41, esp. 38, who suggests that Nanaia was Nabu's mistress, while Tasmetu was his 'legal' wife. A comparable situation is known in Babylon, where Zarpanitu was Marduk's wife whereas Istar was his mistress.</page><page sequence="17">112 Lucinda Dirven the gods of heaven and underworld," epithets traditionally reserved for Marduk.60) A theological piece of propaganda, known as the 'Exalta tion of Nabu', can be read as a legitimization of Nabu's newly acquired supremacy.61) The fact that Marduk and Nabu were considered to be joint rulers of the pantheon and the universe is reflected in the Akitu festival as well.62) Although Marduk is in the limelight of the festival, in the Neo-Babylonian period his son's importance had increased to such a degree that by now he had appropriated functions that had been his father's prerogative. Nabu's eminent position comes to the fore most clearly on the sixth day of the festival. In the temple of Ninurta, Nabu defeats the enemies of his father and presents them to him in Esagil.63) On this day deities from the surroundings of Babylon assemble in Esagil. According to a commentary text on Enuma elish they have come to bring presents to Nabu and to accompany him in the procession to the Akitu chapel.64) It is remarkable that Nabu figures as the most prominent deity in this commentary; the passage of Enuma elish describes the exaltation of Marduk by the assembly of the gods after his defeat of Tiamat and creation of the universe. Late Babylonian hymns addressed to Nabu connect the bringing of presents to Babylon with Nabu's victory over Tiamat.65) A similar role in the Akitu ritual is described in the epic that gives an account of Nabu's exaltation to equality with his father Mar duk. It relates that Nabu went to the Akitu house with his father, and 60) W.G.Lambert, 'Nabu Hymns on Cylinders,' Festschrift Lubor Matous, Vol.2 (ed. B.Hruska and G.Komoroczy, Budapest, 1978), 75-111, esp. 79. 61) The Exaltation of Nabu can be partially reconstructed on the basis of E. Ebe ling, ' Mittelassyrische Rezepte zur Herstellung von wohlriechenden Salben,' Orien talia NS 17 (1948), 129-145; 299-313, taf. 1-14, esp. taf.25-26 (VAT 13834) and Ebe ling, Keilschrifttexte aus Assur religiosen Inhalts, Vol.2 (Leipzig, 1923), no.360, see R.

Cf. the translation of this passage offered by Van der Toorn, 'Babylonische nieuwjaarsfeest,' 25, note 22 (in Dutch): 'He (i.e. Nabu) approached his begetter/ ... he related to his father/ ... who revolted and he passed them before him (i.e. Marduk-Bel). 64) T.G.

A parallel can be found in the Assyr ian commentary on Enuma elish, that states that 'from the sixth until the twelfth day are brought presents for Zababa.' K.4657 (unpubl.) and SM 747 rev. 6 (= L.W.King, CT 13, pi. 32). In the Assyrian Akitu Festival Zababa fulfils the role of Nabu. Cf. K.Deller and V.Donbaz, 'Sanheribs Zababa-Tempel in Assur,' Baghdader Mittei lungen 18 (1987), 221-228. 65) Lambert, 'Nabu hymns,' 95 = BM 34147 B 12 and BM 34710 B7.</page><page sequence="18">The exaltation of Nabu 113 insisted on performing the rites that were formerly executed by his father and henceforth 'set his feet on the rolling sea' (Tiamat).66) The part played by Nabu in the slaying of Tiamat during the Akitu festival in the Neo-Babylonian period accords perfectly with the role fulfilled by the horse man on the Palmyrene relief. Yet the relief and Babylonian practice are separated by almost 500 years. However, being the tutelary deity of the reigning Kings, Nabu is closely connected with the Akitu festival. The continuity of the festival thus accounts for his lasting popularity. The Persian King Cyrus paid homage to Bel and Nabu, and the Seleucid King Antioch I Soter restored Marduk's temple Esagil at Babylon as well as Nabu's temple Ezida at Borsippa.67) In the Seleucid period Nabu was identified with Apollo, the tutelary deity of the Seleucid dynasty.68) This interpretatio graeca is in all probability based upon their common function with respect to the reigning sover eign. It is not without interest that Nabu continues to keep his promi nent position in the Seleucid Era. In Hellenistic documents from south ern Mesopotamia, 'lord of the universe' is a customary epithet of Na bu.69) In northern Syria Nabu and Bel were still closely connected dur ing the first centuries of the common era.70) They were definitely the most prominent deities in the pantheon of Edessa. The Akitu festi val was still celebrated in Edessa and Nabu and Bel were its leading figures.71) It is noteworthy that, in conformity with Nabu's increasing importance during the Neo-Babylonian period, Syrian sources mention him before Bel.72) 66) Ebeling, 'Mittelassyrische Rezepte,' pi. 26, 13. cf. Lambert, 'The Great Battle,' 189-190. 67) A. Kuhrt and S. Sherwin-White, 'Aspects of Royal Ideology,' 71-86. 68) Drijvers, Edessa, 67-74. It should be noted, however, that before the Seleucid period Nabu's oracles are invariably related to the reigning King. 69) G. J. P. McEwan, Priest and Temple in Hellenistic Babylonia (FAOS 4, Wies baden 1981), 35, 123, 125. 70) Drijvers, Edessa, 48-53. 71) The Acts of Sharbel (to be dated at the end of the fourth, or beginning of the fifth century CE) mentions a great feast on the eighth of Nisan and states that: "The whole population assembled near the big altar in the centre of the city, just in front of the record-office, where all deities were gathered, adorned and got a place of hon our: Nebo and Bel and their companions." (translation Drijvers, Edessa, 43; my ita lics). The chronicle of Joshua the Stylite mentions the celebration of this festival in Edessa in the year 498 CE, cf. Wright, The Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite (Cam bridge 1882), 20f (translation), 24, 1. 15ff. (text). The text refers to 'that festival at which the pagan myths used to be recited,' (cf. Drijvers, Edessa, 43, note 10 for this translation). It is not unthinkable that this refers to the recitation of parts of Enuma elish. 72) Drijvers, Edessa, 40-45 and 179.</page><page sequence="19">114 Lucinda Dirven For a long time it was assumed that in the common era Nabu was of minor importance in the religion of Palmyra. Contrary to the practice in the remainder of Syria, the ties between Nabu and Bel appeared to be rather loose.73) This view is invalidated by the recent identification of an important temple as the sanctuary of Nabu. This temple is situ ated close to the temple of Bel, to the north of the wadi, to which the propylaea of the temple of Bel are oriented. Although some preliminary reports have been published on this matter, the final publication has not yet appeared.74) The material available thus far, does shed a new light on the character of Nabu and his cult. However,until the final publication of this temple, the tesserae figuring Nabu remain the main source of information.75) According to the inscriptions that were found in the sanctuary, the temple of Nabu was built during the last quarter of the first century CE.76) However, there is evidence suggesting that previously an older sanctuary occupied this spot and that the cult of Nabu is much older.77) In all probability Nabu arrived in Palmyra together with Bel and other Babylonian deities in a period in which the city was strongly influenced by the East, well before the common era.78) The proximity of the temple of Nabu to the temple of Bel, suggests that Nabu was still closely connected to the cult of Bel in the common era. This connection 73) Fevrier, Religion des Palmyreniens, 97; Drijvers, Edessa, 46. 74) The temple was excavated by the Syrian archaeological mission in 1963-64 and 1970. Cf.

On the time and origin of Babylonian influence upon Palmyra, compare above, note 10.</page><page sequence="20">The exaltation of Nabu 115 is confirmed by tesserae that associate Nabu with the major deities from the temple of Bel; Bel, Iarhibol and Aglibol.79) Conclusion Given Nabu's Babylonian origin, his connection with Bel, and the prominence of his sanctuary in Palmyra, he is the most likely candidate for the cavalryman on the relief from the temple of Bel. As stated above, two of the reliefs that decorated the peristyle of the temple of Bel relate to prominent sanctuaries in the city of Palmyra. If the mounted deity is indeed to be identified as Nabu, this holds true for the battle scene as well. The fact that Nabu is the leading figure instead of Bel, explains why the group of attending deities is at odds with the cult of Bel. In all probability they are not connected with the temple of Bel, but with the cult of the temple of Nabu.80) We have to wait for the final publication of this temple in order to fully substantiate this hy pothesis. At the present state of research it can be shown that two of the deities from this group are related to Nabu. In conformity with Ba bylonian practice Nabu was associated with the goddess Nanaia in Pal myra. Nanaia is pictured as the Greek goddess Artemis and hence the female deity with the bow on the battle-relief in all probability repre sents this Babylonian goddess.81) The second deity on the relief that is associated with Nabu is Heracles; Nabu and Heracles-Nergal appear 79) RTP nos. 119, 136 and 137 and Dunant, 'Nouvelles tesseres,' no. 26 (= correc tion upon RTP no. 244). 80) RTP no.297 bears the inscription 'Nabu six.' Although this number can refer to almost anything, it is tempting to connect this with the sixth of Nisan, the day of Nabu's exaltation. The hypothesis that the festival of Nabu was celebrated in the month of Nisan is confirmed by a dedicatory inscription from his temple, dated in the month Nisan of the year 146 CE: Bounni, 'Le sanctuaire de Nabu,' 157 = IB. 10/ 63. The fact that it was customary to consecrate temples during the days that the god's festival was celebrated, contributes to the validity of this observation. Cf. Du nant, Sanctuaire de Baalshamin, 8. 81) RTP nos. 310 and 285. For a more detailed discussion see above, note 39. The cult of this Babylonian goddess is well attested in Palmyra. Nanaia is mentioned on seven tesserae (RTP nos. 134, 238-242, 285) and depicted on two or four of these (RTP nos. 198(7), 285, 286(7), 310). The only tessera that combines text and image is RTP no. 285, cf. the description above, note 39. On top of the tesserae the goddess is mentioned in an inscription found in the tem ple of Bel, dated in 6 BCE, in which a member of the Bene Komare is honoured for his contributions to various cult buildings for 'Herta, Nanaia and Resef, the gods:' Cantineau, 'Tadmorea,' Syria 17 (1936), 274-277, no. 19; cf. the ameliorated read ings of Gawlikowski, Temple, 60-63, and Milik, Dedicaces, 220.</page><page sequence="21">116 Lucinda Dirven together on tesserae from Palmyra.82) The relation between both deities is confirmed by a relief figuring Heracles that was found in the temple of Nabu.83) The battle relief from the temple of Bel represents the slaying of Tia mat by Nabu and Bel. Contrary to previous interpretations, we may conclude that Nabu instead of Bel is the leading figure in this event. In this respect Palmyrene practice accords with the later Babylonian view, and as such exemplifies the diffusion and continuity of Babylonian cul ture and religion. 82) RTP nos. 168 and 237. 83) Bounni, 'Six nouveaux,' 134, pl.X; Drijvers, Religion of Palmyra, pi.
