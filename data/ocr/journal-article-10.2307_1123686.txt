<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY IN LEGISLATIVE COURTS Marc D. Falkoff Over the last decade, the Supreme Court has greatly broadened the im- munity that states enjoy from citizen suits brought for violations of federal law. With its decisions in Seminole Tribe v. Florida and Alden v. Maine, the Court has assured that states are now substantially immune from suits brought in both federal courts and the states' own courts. A strong immunity doctrine is necessary, according to the Court, to assure that essen- tially political decisions remain in the politically accountable branches of government rather than in the hands of individual litigants and judges. Scholars, however, have criticized this jurisprudence as antithetical to the rule of law. This Note seeks to reconcile the Court's accountability concerns with its critics' rule-of-law concerns. It proposes that Congress abrogate state immunity from suits for violations ofparticularfederal statutes in legislative courts-which are political bodies in the executive branch. In such tribu- nals, individuals could vindicate theirfederal statutory rights, subject to the approval and oversight of politically accountable officials in the executive branch. INTRODUCTION With its decisions in Seminole Tribe v. Florida' and Alden v. Maine,2 the Supreme Court has tremendously broadened the immunity that states en- joy from suits brought by private individuals. In Seminole Tribe, the Court held that a state may not be sued in federal court for violations of the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.3 In Alden, the Court held that a state may not be sued in its own courts for violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.4 In both instances, Congress had expressly de- clared its intention to make the states subject to suit by private parties. Taken together, these decisions thus establish the remarkable proposi- tion that states may violate federal statutes yet not be held accountable in any court of law.5 State immunity from suit has been a controversial doctrine in the United States since the Founding. Indeed, the doctrine was initially repu- diated by the Supreme Court in the early days of the Republic, in 1. 517 U.S. 44 (1996). 2. 527 U.S. 706 (1999). 3. 517 U.S. at 47. 4. 527 U.S. at 712. 5. This statement is subject to some important limitations. States that have violated federal statutes may, for instance, be subjected to suits brought on behalf of the aggrieved party by the United States itself.

Georgia.6 In the immediate aftermath of Chisholm, however, state immunity was broadened by the passage of the Eleventh Amend- ment, and the precise contours of the doctrine have remained in flux ever since. Over the last century, the Court has gradually expanded the reach of sovereign immunity, relying on constitutional arguments that have frequently been subject to harsh criticism. But it is only with the Court's recent decisions in Seminole Tribe and Alden that state immunity has become effectively absolute, leading scholars to challenge the Court's jurisprudence in this area as contravening the rule of law.7 ChiefJustice Marshall, in his aspirational dicta in Marbury v. Madison, asserted that "[t]he government of the United States has been emphati- cally termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right."8 This theme resonates throughout American constitutional jurisprudence: Where there is a right, there must be a remedy for the infringement of that right.9 With respect to state violations of federal statutes, however, it has become clear that the 6. 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793).

[that] inevitably places a lesser value on administering justice to the individual than on giving government a license to act arbitrarily."). 8. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803). 9. As Justice Souter noted in Alden: [T]here is much irony in the Court's profession that it grounds its opinion on a deeply rooted historical tradition of sovereign immunity, when the Court abandons a principle nearly as inveterate, and much closer to the hearts of the Framers: that where there is a right, there must be a remedy. 527 U.S. 706, 811 (1999) (Souter,J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 110 (1994) (explaining that due process requires state to provide "clear and certain" remedy for violations of federal law, notwithstanding the sovereign immunity traditionally enjoyed by states in their own courts); Ward v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 253 U.S. 17, 24 (1920) (explaining that due process requires a right of action and a remedy). But as frequently as this motif sounds in our case law, it is not self-evident that the proposition is a sine qua non of just government. See Richard H. Fallon, Jr. &amp; DanielJ. Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733, 1778 (1991) ("Few principles of the American constitutional tradition resonate more strongly than [that] stated in Marbury v. Madison .... Yet Marbury's apparent promise of effective redress for all constitutional violations reflects a principle, not an ironclad rule, and its ideal is not always attained.").</page><page sequence="3">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 855 Court discerns some principle more compelling than this traditional rule- of-law value. What is this compelling principle? The Court has offered two broad rationales for its sovereign immunity jurisprudence. First, it has set out an historical justification, explaining that state immunity from private suits brought in a judicial court is a "fundamental postulate[ ]" of our constitutional order."'l According to the Court, at the time the Constitu- tion was drafted and ratified, "it was well established in English law that the Crown could not be sued without consent in its own courts," and that the American people tacitly accepted this inheritance from English politi- cal theory.' 1 Second, the Court has argued that allowing the states to be sued by individuals in a court of law does not comport with the "dignity" and "respect" owed them as sovereign entities in our dual-sovereignty sys- tem of government.'2 Although each of these grounds has elicited vehe- ment criticism from the dissenting Justices, underlying the Court's rea- soning is a coherent and compelling policy consideration: Political decisions, such as those respecting the disbursement of funds from the state treasury, must remain in the hands of the politically accountable branches of government and out of the hands of the judiciary.'3 This Note contends that rule-of-law values may be reconciled with the Court's interest in transparency and political accountability in the state sovereign immunity context. In particular, the Note proposes that Congress may achieve such harmonization by abrogating state sovereign immunity in non-Article III courts for state violations of federal statutory rights. As a general matter, Congress may not abrogate state immunity from suits brought by private citizens in courts of law. Congress may, however, regulate the states as states.'4 Congress may likewise regulate by establish- ing adjudicative administrative agencies-commonly referred to as "legis- 10. Alden, 527 U.S. at 729; see also Idaho v. Couer d'Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 267-68 (1997) (alluding to "tradition" and "well-established principles"); Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55-56 (1996) (describing "broader principles" that the Eleventh Armendment reflects). This Note will make no attempt to evaluate the historical justifications for the doctrine laid out by the Court; such critiques have been offered by its dissenting members. See, e.g., Alden, 527 U.S. at 764-98 (Souter, J., dissenting); Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 102-68 (Souter, J., dissenting). 11. Alden, 527 U.S. at 715. 12.

See Alden, 527 U.S. at 750 (explaining that when "the States' immunity from private suits is disregarded, 'the course of their public policy and the administration of their public affairs' may become 'subject to and controlled by the mandates of judicial tribunals without their consent, and in favor of individual interests"' (quoting In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 505 (1887))). 14.

This Note therefore argues that Congress may constitu- tionally allow individuals to vindicate a state's violation of federal law in an administrative court. Part I of this Note examines the expansive interpretation the Court has lent state sovereign immunity doctrine during the past hundred years, and also discusses the authority of Congress to abrogate a state's immunity from suit under its Article I and Fourteenth Amendment pow- ers. It will then focus particular attention on Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Alden v. Maine, where the Court's accountability concerns are most explicitly articulated. Part II explores the power of Congress both to regulate the states directly and to regulate in its areas of competence through the creation of legislative courts. Part III argues that Congress may constitutionally regulate the states by making them susceptible to suit in these non-Article III courts. Such a regulatory scheme would pro- mote rule-of-law values while demonstrating respect for the dignity of the states by ensuring that lines of political accountability for the actions taken against them remain transparent. I. STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOCTRINE The evolution of state sovereign immunity doctrine has been well- rehearsed elsewhere.'7 Section A of this Part will thus provide only a thumbnail sketch of the history of the doctrine in America, and Section B 15. A legislative court is an adjudicative body created by Congress and functioning under the aegis of the executive branch. Since it is not constituted pursuant to Article III of the Constitution, a legislative court is political, rather than judicial, in nature. The term "legislative courts" was first used in American Insurance Co. v. Canter in Justice Marshall's discussion of territorial courts. 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 511, 546 (1828) ("These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts .... They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States."). The practical difference between a legislative and an Article III court is that only in the latter are judges granted salary protection and lifetime tenure. This Note uses the terms "Article I courts," "non-Article III courts," and "legislative courts" interchangeably. 16. See, e.g., Freytag v. Comm'r, 501 U.S. 868, 911 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("Where adjudicative decisionmakers do not possess life tenure and a permanent salary, they are 'incapable of exercising any portion of the judicial power."' (quoting Ex parte Randolph, 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (C.C.D. Va. 1833) (No. 11,558) (Marshall, C.J.))). 17. See Henry Paul Monaghan, Comment, The Sovereign Immunity "Exception," 110 Harv. L. Rev. 102, 103 n.12 (1996) [hereinafter Monaghan, Exception] ("There seem to be nearly as many accounts as there are legal historians.").

Section C will focus on Alden and the Court's limitations on Congress's Article I abrogation power; it will argue that the compelling policy rationale behind the Court's robust sovereign immunity doctrine is that accountability must be retained in the political branches of government. A. Interpreting Article III and the Eleventh Amendment Whether the doctrine of state sovereign immunity comports with the ideals of a republican government has been debated from the earliest years of our nation. In the 1793 case of Chisholm v. Georgia, the Court was required to decide whether Georgia could be haled into federal court to defend against an action brought in assumpsit by a citizen of South Caro- lina. Looking to the text of Article III of the Constitution, which deline- ates the judicial power of the United States, the Court found only silence on the issue of sovereign immunity. As Justice Wilson noted, "[t] o the Constitution of the United States the term SOVEREIGN, is totally un- known." 18 Absent an express grant of sovereign immunity to the states in Article III, four of the five Justices refused to read such immunity into the constitutional text, finding the doctrine to be contrary to the ideals of a republican government19 and antithetical to the principle of the rule of law.20 Only one Justice dissented, relying on a statutory analysis of the Judiciary Act of 1789 rather than on a constitutional analysis of Article 111.21 It has been said that the Court's decision in Chisholm "fell upon the country with a profound shock."22 The Eleventh Amendment to the Con- 18.

See id. at 479 (Jay, CJ.) ("The extension of the judiciary power of the United States to such controversies, appears to me to be wise, . . . because it teaches and greatly appreciates the value of our free republican national Government, which places all our citizens on an equal footing ...."); cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 802-03 (1999) (Souter, J., dissenting) (arguing that the Court's sovereign immunity doctrine is "inimical to the republican conception, which rests on the understanding of its citizens precisely that the government is not above them, but of them, its actions being governed by law just like their own"). 20. See Chisholm, 2 U.S. at 456 (Wilson,J.) ("Ifjustice is not done; if engagements are not fulfilled; is it upon general principles of right, less proper, in the case of a great number, than in the case of an individual, to secure, by compulsion, that, which will not be voluntarily performed?"). 21. See id. at 431-34 (Iredell, J., dissenting). Determining that Congress had not explicitly spoken to the issue of sovereign immunity in the Act, Justice Iredell turned to English common law to determine whether such an action could be maintained against one of the states, and concluded that it could not. Id. at 437-38. He intimated, however, that Congress might have the power to subject states to suit at the behest of individuals. Id. at 449. 22. Charles Warren, 1 The Supreme Court in United States History 96 (rev. ed. 1932); see also Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 11 (1890) (suggesting that Chisholm "created such a</page><page sequence="6">858 COLUMBIA LAW REV7EW [Vol. 101:853 stitution was proposed at the first meeting of Congress after the Court's decision, and was in a short time duly adopted by the states.23 The pas- sage of the Amendment was at minimum an instruction to the Court to recognize that the states were entitled to a sphere of immunity from suits brought by private parties.24 From the text of the Amendment, however, this sphere of immunity looks rather limited. For example, the Eleventh Amendment makes it clear that states are "immune" from suits in law or equity, but no mention is made of suits in admiralty. Also, a state has immunity from suits brought by a citizen of another state, but no men- tion is made of immunity for suits prosecuted by a citizen of the same state. Textually, therefore, the Eleventh Amendment pretended to do no more than establish a state's immunity within a limited compass. Nonetheless, the Court ruled in 1890 in Hans v. Louisiana that the Eleventh Amendment conferred immunity upon states from actions initi- ated by its own citizens.25 Acknowledging that the text of the Amend- ment was silent on this issue, the Court wrote that a literal interpretation of the Amendment would "strain the Constitution and the law to a con- shock of surprise throughout the country that, at the very first meeting of Congress thereafter, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution was almost unanimously proposed, and was in due course adopted by the legislatures of the States"). In a rather dramatic gesture, Georgia nearly enacted a law that would have mandated death by hanging for any person who attempted to bring suit against the state pursuant to the decision. See Clyde E. Jacobs, The Eleventh Amendment and Sovereign Immunity 56-57 (1972);John V. Orth, The Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 18 (1987). But note that some scholars dispute the profound shock theory. See, e.g., James E. Pfander, Rethinking the Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction in State-Party Cases, 82 Cal. L. Rev. 555, 588 (1994) (critiquing the profound-shock theory). 23. The Eleventh Amendment states: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." U.S. Const. amend. XI. 24. To describe the Eleventh Amendment as confering an immunity on the states would be problematic in at least two ways. First, the Court has stated in Alden that the Eleventh Amendment did not grant anything to the states; rather, it affirmed a principle of immunity inherent in the structure of the Constitution. See Alden, 527 U.S. at 713 (noting that the phrase "Eleventh Amendment immunity" is "convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment"). Second, to characterize the Eleventh Amendment as a grant of sovereign immunity is arguably to engage in an act of reification, since the Amendment in terms does no more than set limits to the judicial power of the United States. As Professor Pfander has argued: [O]nce the Court begins to conceptualize the problem of state suability in terms of a free-standing principle of "sovereign immunity," rather than as a technical problem in the parsing of the language of judicial power, it unleashes a dangerous and unwieldy restriction on the federal courts' power to enforce federal-law restrictions against the states. James E. Pfander, History and State Suability: An "Explanatory" Account of the Eleventh Amendment, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1269, 1280 (1998). 25. 134 U.S. at 14-15.</page><page sequence="7">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 859 struction never imagined or dreamed of."26 The Court argued that it was "almost an absurdity on its face" to suppose that, at the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, states were supposed to be immune from suits brought by citizens of other states, but not from suits brought by their own citizens.27 The Court thus refused to constrict the doctrine of state sovereign immunity to the narrow grant contained in the actual language of the Eleventh Amendment. Having loosed the doctrine of sovereign immunity from its textual moorings, the Court proceeded in subsequent cases to expand its breadth even further. In Ex parte New York, the Court held that the Elev- enth Amendment bars suits brought against a state in admiralty, even though the text of the Amendment refers only to suits in law or equity.28 The Court has also held states to be immune from suits brought under federal statute by foreign corporations29 and Native American tribes.30 And in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, the Court held that the Amendment bars suits against a state brought by a foreign country, ex- plaining that "we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of ? 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States," since "[b] ehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control."', The post-Hans expansion of the Eleventh Amendment has not, how- ever, been boundless. The Court has held, for example, that states are not immune from suits brought by other states,32 and in United States v. Texas the Court held that states are not immune from suits brought by the federal government.33 This latter constraint on the immunity of the states is particularly noteworthy, because it means that a state violation of a private citizen's federal rights may be vindicated by a suit brought on behalf of the individual by the United States. While in practice this ave- nue of relief is exceedingly limited, since the resources of the executive branch are inadequate to vindicate the rights of even a portion of those aggrieved,34 this "exception" demonstrates that the Court does not per- ceive state immunity to be immutable or an end in itself. Instead, the object of the Court in establishing a robust state immu- nity doctrine appears to be an effort to require that essentially political decisions be made within the elected rather than the judicial branches of 26.

Indeed, this is precisely the understanding under which the Alden Court was operating when it explained that "[s] uits brought by the United States itself require the exercise of political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a State, a control which is absent from a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsenting States."35 Were indi- viduals allowed to bring suit against a state in either federal or state court, the irreducibly political function of managing the state treasury would fall upon the courts. By allowing the United States to bring suit on behalf of an individual against a state, however, political accountability is reconsti- tuted. If the federal government finds an individual's interest compel- ling, it may shoulder the political accountability attendant upon bringing suit against a state; such a suit is constitutionally acceptable since respon- sibility shifts from the popularly unaccountable judicial branch to the po- litically accountable federal executive branch.36 B. Congress's Abrogation Powers Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment Despite the Court's broad view of sovereign immunity, it has allowed Congress to abrogate state immunity, under limited circumstances, pursu- ant to Congress's enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The exact circumstances under which the Court has up- held this abrogation power lend support to the thesis that political ac- countability drives the Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, with the Court's recent curtailment of this abrogation power highlighting the pressing need for alternative methods to vindicate state violations of fed- eral rights. Under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress is given the "power to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the constitutional guarantee that no state will deprive any person of "life, liberty, or prop- erty, without due process of law," nor deny any person the "equal protec- 35. Id. at 756. 36. In addition to Texas, the Court has affirmed other robust exceptions to the immunity of states from being haled into Court by individuals. A state may, for instance, consent to suit in either its own or a federal court. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447 (1883). An individual may bring suit against a state officer in order to obtain prospective relief from a continuing violation of federal law. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-57 (1908); see also Monaghan, Exception, supra note 17, at 103 (arguing that the Ex parte Young doctrine swallows up immunity doctrine, such that as a practical matter state immunity is more the exception than the rule). Individuals may also seek compensation for past violations of federal rights by state officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ? 1983. See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25-31 (1991). A state may not invoke sovereign immunity as a defense to proceedings on appeal from the state courts to the Supreme Court. McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 26-27 (1990); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 380-83 (1821). Sovereign immunity does not bar suits against local or county governments. Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530 (1890). And sovereign immunity does not bar suits against multi-state agencies. Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 400-02 (1979).</page><page sequence="9">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 861 tion of the laws."37 The first case to test whether Congress could, through its section 5 powers, abrogate a state's sovereign immunity for a violation of a federal law passed pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment was Fitz- patrick v. Bitzer, a Title VII federal court action in which a Connecticut retirement plan was challenged as discriminating against male employ- ees.38 Connecticut asserted its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, relying on Hans and its progeny. But writing for the majority, Justice Rehnquist held that the Eleventh Amendment could not bar an action brought pursuant to a statute passed under the Fourteenth Amendment. As he explained, the Court was obliged to recognize that the Fourteenth Amendment had brought about a shift in the balance of power between the states and the federal government, and that the states were therefore to be held liable under statutes passed pursuant to the Amendment.39 Section 5, therefore, provides Congress with a robust power to subject states to suit in the Fourteenth Amendment context. The Court has, however, subsequently circumscribed Congress's sec- tion 5 abrogation powers in two ways. First, it has shown itself unwilling to read Congress's authority under the section broadly. In the 1997 case of City of Boerne v. Flores, for example, the Court held that Congress has power under section 5 to create remedies for violations of Fourteenth Amendment rights, but that it does not have the power to alter substantive rights.40 This holding was strengthened in 1999 in Florida Prepaid Post- 37. U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The text of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment states, in pertinent part: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Justice Rehnquist wrote: [W]e think that the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of ? 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that section Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce "by appropriate legislation" the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which themselves embody significant limitations on state authority.

In Boerne, the Court found that Congress had overreached in passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibited "'Government' from 'substantially burden [ing]' a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden '(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that . . . interest."'

College Savings Bank, where the Court held that congressional action under section 5 would be constitutional only if (1) Congress had identified state conduct transgressing the Four- teenth Amendment's substantive provisions before it enacted the remedial legislation, and (2) Congress had narrowly tailored its legislation to remedy or prevent the state misconduct.4' The Court's cabining of Congress's abrogation powers under section 5 accords with its underlying concern for maintaining transparency and political accountability, since broad ab- rogation powers can only muddy the public's perception of which govern- mental body is responsible for the allocation of state moneys. That political accountability is the Court's central concern may also be inferred from its second manner of constricting the section 5 abroga- tion powers of Congress: through the adoption of an increasingly rigor- ous "clear statement" rule. In Quern v. Jordan, the Court held that Con- gress must use clear and explicit language if it intends to "sweep away the immunity of the States"42 -a standard that was ratcheted up in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, where the Court required that Congress "mak[e] its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."43 One reason to dictate such a stringent standard is to assure that the courts are certain of Congress's intent to abrogate a state's immunity, since the con- sequence of such abrogation is to upset "the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government."44 But another conse- quence of requiring Congress to be explicit in its intentions is to raise the political cost to Congress of subjecting the states to suit.45 The Court has made it clear that it will not allow the elected branches to slough off responsibility for their political choices onto the judicial branch.

Congress's Abrogation Powers Pursuant to Article I The Court has upheld the ability of Congress to abrogate the Elev- enth Amendment immunity of the states under its Article I powers in only one case. Justice Brennan, writing for a plurality in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., held that the Interstate Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to abrogate state immunity, since the power to regulate inter- state commerce would be "incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages."47 The Court reasoned that "'the States surren- dered a portion of their sovereignty when they granted Congress the power to regulate commerce,"' and "[b]y empowering Congress to regu- late commerce, ... the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation."48 However, Union Gas was explicitly overruled in Seminole Tribe v. Flor- ida in 1996.49 Faced with an Eleventh Amendment challenge to the In- dian Gaming Regulatory Act, which had been passed pursuant to Con- gress's Indian Commerce Clause authority, the Court ruled that Congress's attempt to abrogate state immunity through its Article I pow- ers was unconstitutional. Embracing a conception of sovereign immunity as a fundamental tenet of constitutional law, the Court explained that the background principle of sovereign immunity cannot be abridged, even in areas where Congress is vested with complete lawmaking authority.5" Finding no principled distinction between Congress's Commerce Clause and its Indian Commerce Clause powers, the Court opted to overrule Union Gas and establish that under none of its Article I powers was Con- 46.

Maine.53 At issue in Alden was Maine's assertion that sovereign immunity protected it from suits brought by state employees alleging violations of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Court decided not only that Con- gress was unauthorized to abrogate a state's immunity from suit for viola- tion of a federal statute in federal court, but also that Congress lacked the authority to abrogate state immunity from suit in a state's own courts.54 With the decision in Alden, therefore, the Court's sovereign immunity ju- risprudence would appear to have reached its substantive denouement. Absent extraordinary circumstances, such as the United States govern- ment bringing suit on an individual's behalf, states may violate federal statutes and remain immune from suit in any judicial court, federal or state. The Court offered two justifications for this holding. First, it reaf- firmed the postulate laid out in Seminole Tribe that sovereign immunity was a background principle of constitutional law rather than a creature of the Eleventh Amendment.55 As in Seminole Tribe, this defense of the Court's sovereign immunityjurisprudence relied on an historical account of the states' immunity that has been contested by both scholars and-in exhaustive detail-by the dissentingJustices.56 Second, with great rhetor- ical flourish the Court emphasized that sovereign immunity preserves the 51.

See id. at 728 (describing the Court's "settled doctrinal understanding" that "sovereign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself"). It is not surprising, of course, that the Court premised its holding on the presumption that the immunity of the states from suit is a "fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution," id. at 713, since the Eleventh Amendment itself (as a restriction on the judicial power of the United States) has no relevance for actions brought in state court. 56.

It is beyond the scope of this Note to assess the</page><page sequence="13">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 865 dignity and respect that the states as sovereign entities deserve. For in- stance, the Court explained that "immunity from private suits [is] central to sovereign dignity,"57 and that "[w]hen Congress legislates in matters affecting the States, it may not treat these sovereign entities as mere prefectures or corporations. Congress must accord States the esteem due to them as joint participants in a federal system . . .58 This language of esteem" and "respect" was buttressed with quotations from earlier cases in which the Court made similar gestures toward preserving the dignitary value of its sovereign immunity doctrine.59 Although tempting, it would be a mistake to read the Alden Court's appeals to state dignity as empty rhetoric devoid of substance.60 Earlier opinions certainly did suggest, in ipse dixit fashion, that upholding a state's dignity was the overriding goal of the Court's sovereign immunity doctrine.6' But in Alden the Court went to great lengths to articulate the substance underlying the rhetoric of dignity-that the elected branches of government must not be subjected to the coercion of the judicial branch. Of particular concern to the Court was the idea that a state would be "subject to the power of private citizens to levy on its treasury or perhaps even government buildings or property which the State adminis- ters on the public's behalf."62 The harm of a private citizen "levying on its treasury" is that the essence of political decisionmaking-i.e., how state money is to be distributed-would be displaced onto an unaccount- able judiciary. This concern is further evident in the Court's subsequent citation to In re Ayers, an 1887 decision in which that Court noted that "[t] he very object and purpose of the 11th Amendment were to prevent the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process ofjudicial tribu- nals at the instance of private parties."63 The Court in Ayers went on to explain that: It was thought to be neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United States, adequacy of either the majority or dissenting accounts of historical background of sovereign immunity. 57.

Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 146 (1993) (stating that principle of sovereign immunity "accords the States the respect owed them as members of the federation"). 60. Justice Souter, in his dissenting opinion in Alden, clearly found it difficult to take the argument from dignity seriously. See infra notes 72-74 and accompanying text. 61. See, e.g., P.R Aqueduct, 506 U.S. at 146 ("While application of the collateral order doctrine in this type of case is justified in part by a concern that States not be unduly burdened by litigation, its ultimate justification is the importance of ensuring that the States' dignitary interests can be fully vindicated."). 62.

In fact, the Court in Alden was even more explicit in highlighting its concern that accountability be retained in the political branches of gov- ernment. For example, Justice Kennedy explained that immunity from litigation protects "'the states and the nation from unanticipated inter- vention in the processes of government,"' since the authorization of pri- vate suits would "place unwarranted strain" on the ability of the states to "govern in accordance with the will of their citizens" and to allocate scarce resources, an "interest [that] lies at the heart of the political pro- cess."65 Distribution of moneys from the public fisc, in other words, re- quires political judgment for which the courts are constitutionally un- suited.66 Moreover, [w]hen the Federal Government asserts authority over a State's most fundamental political processes, it strikes at the heart of the political accountability so essential to our liberty and repub- lican form of government. The asserted authority would blur not only the distinct responsibilities of the State and National Governments but also the separate duties of the judicial and po- litical branches of the state governments, displacing "state deci- sions that 'go to the heart of representative government. "967 Justice Kennedy explained that sovereign immunity blurs the lines of po- litical responsibility along two axes: both among the branches of govern- ment and between the state and federal governments. As such, the Alden decision fits nicely into place with the Court's other recent federalism decisions. In New York v. United States, for example, the Court struck down a congressional attempt to commandeer the states by forcing them either to regulate according to congressional requirements or else to take possession of radioactive waste.68 The Court explained that "where the Federal government compels States to regulate, the accountability of 64.

Similarly, in Printz v. United States the Court explained that the commandeering of state officials, like the commandeering of state legisla- tures, was unacceptable since the states are "put in the position of taking the blame for [the federal regulation's] burdensomeness and for its de- fects."70 Alden is thus of a piece with the Court's recent federalism cases and their heightened concern for establishing clear lines of political accountability.7' In dissent, Justice Souter provided a strong historical refutation of the majority's defense of state sovereign immunity, but he did not engage vigorously with the Court's political accountability rationale for promot- ing a muscular sovereign immunity doctrine. Opting not to acknowledge the substantive values underlying the Court's decision, Justice Souter merely expressed outrage at the majority's use of anthropomorphic lan- guage. For instance, he argued that the Court's "assum[ption] that this 'dignity' is a quality easily translated from the person of the King to the participatory abstraction of a republican State" is "thoroughly anoma- lous" and "inimical to the republican conception."72 Moreover, he sug- gested that it is "symptomatic of the weakness of the structural notion proffered by the Court that it seeks to buttress the argument by relying on 'the dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is de- 69.

Hartley, The Alden Trilogy: Praise and Protest, 23 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 323, 350 (2000), suggesting that "[olne might fairly argue that the most valid understanding of the interpretive process deployed in Alden is that a majority of the Court preferred state autonomy, fiscal predictability, and political accountability, and disapproved of individuals' ability to influence the course of government through litigation." But note that at least some scholars remain unsure about the Court's steadfastness with respect to its accountability arguments. William P. Marshall and Jason S. Cowart, for instance, in discussing the political accountability concerns manifested in Alden, suggest that the Court is reluctant "to take the accountability rationale to its logical conclusion" and that it "may not be fully committed to this theory as an explanation of state immunity doctrine."

First, he emphasizes that the ability of the federal government to bring suit on behalf of individuals, pursuant to United States v. Texas,75 is in reality impracticable "unless Congress plans a significant expansion of the National Government's litigating forces to provide a lawyer whenever pri- vate litigation is barred by today's decision and Seminole Tribe."76 Thus, the Alden majority's exclusive focus on accountability risks leaving no channels for the vindication of individual rights. Second, Justice Souter's dissent also calls our attention to an important point not disputed by the majority-that state sovereignty does not impede Congress from regulat- ing the states pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers, and that the states are bound by such regulation, irrespective of their immunity from SUit.77 73.

Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. 506 U.S. 139, 151 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (arguing that concern for state dignity is "an embarrassingly insufficient" rationale for the justification of sovereign immunity at the expense of "the fair and efficient administration ofjustice"); cf. Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 406 (1821) (Marshall, CJ.) ("We must ascribe the [Eleventh] amendment, then, to some other cause than the dignity of a State."). 74. Alden, 527 U.S. at 802 (Souter, J., dissenting). In this regard, Justice O'Connor's admonition in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, that the dissent's calcified position on sovereign immunity doctrine has preempted further substantive debate, may be well taken. 528 U.S. 62, 79-80 (2000) ("Indeed, the present dissenters' refusal to accept the validity and natural import of decisions like Hans, rendered over a full century ago by this Court, makes it difficult to engage in additional meaningful debate on the place of state sovereign immunity in the Constitution."); cf. id. at 97 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("I am unwilling to accept Seminole Tribe as controlling precedent."); Alden, 527 U.S. at 761 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("On each point the Court has raised it is mistaken."). That the majority and dissent have such entrenched positions is not surprising. As John V. Orth suggested a decade before the decision in Seminole Tribe, "[t]he search for the original understanding on state sovereign immunity bears this much resemblance to the quest for the Holy Grail: there is enough to be found so that the faithful of whatever persuasion can find their heart's desire. And . . . the object of the search may prove equally illusory." Orth, supra note 22, at 28. 75. 143 U.S. 621, 644-45 (1892). 76. Alden, 527 U.S. at 810 (Souter, J., dissenting). 77.

Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority in Alden, acknowledged that the states are bound by federal law under the Supremacy Clause, but found this fact to be irrelevant to the question of whether a state may thus be sued: The constitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign immunity in its own courts does not confer upon the State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution or valid federal law.... We are unwilling to assume the States will refuse to honor the Constitution or obey the binding laws of the United States. Id. at 754-55.

II. LEGISLATIVE COURTS AND CONGRESSIONAL REGULATION OF THE STATES As this Part explains, Congress not only possesses the power to regu- late the states as states, but also to regulate private parties through the creation of non-Article III tribunals. Within such legislative courts Con- gress need not assure litigants who are asserting their statutory rights all of the judicial protections required in an Article III setting. A. Congressional Regulation of the States as States Under current doctrine, the states possess significant immunity from lawsuits, but their immunity from regulation is much more limited. In its 1985 decision in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court held that the states are not immune from congressional regulation passed pursuant to either the Commerce Clause or to Congress's other Article I powers.78 Garcia overruled National League of Cities v. Usery, where the propriety of congressional regulation of the states was made to depend on a distinction between regulation of the states in their tradi- tional governmental functions, and regulation of the states in their mar- ket-participant functions.79 This distinction was held to be "unworkable" in practice, "invit[ing] an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies it favors and which ones it dislikes."80 Finding no constitutional principle by which to draw such a line, the Court re- fused to rely on "a priori definitions of state sovereignty," and instead ar- gued that the measure of state sovereignty lies in the very structure of our federalism rather than in "discrete limitations on the objects of federal authority."8' 78. 469 U.S. 528, 548 (1985). In Garcia, the Court held that the Fair Labor Standards Act was constitutional as applied against the states, and specifically that the federal government could regulate the states in matters relating to the payment of overtime wages to certain employees. 79. See Nat'l League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 845, 852, 854 (1976) (holding that state is immune from regulation if the federal interest does not justify state submission, and if the federal statute regulates states as states, addresses matters that are indisputably attributes of state sovereignty, and impairs states' ability to structure integral relations in areas of traditional government functions), overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985); see also Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264, 287-88 (1981) (encapsulating National League of Cities test) . 80.

While regulation of the states as states is permissible because state interests are protected by the federalist structure, the abrogation of the states' immunity from suit is impermissible because those same safe- guards are inadequate to protect the states' sovereignty.83 laid out in Professor Wechsler's classic treatise on the structural protections of federalism. See Herbert Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543, 559 (1954) (arguing that the structure of federalism assures that state interests are adequately protected against congressional action, and that "the Court is on weakest ground when it opposes its interpretation of the Constitution to that of Congress in the interest of the states, whose representatives control the legislative process and, by hypothesis, have broadly acquiesced in sanctioning the challenged Act of Congress"); see also The Federalist No. 33, at 224 (Alexander Hamilton) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (suggesting that "the danger which most threatens our political welfare is that the State governments will finally sap the foundations of the Union"); The Federalist No. 46, at 299 (James Madison) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987) (suggesting that a "local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of Congress than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the particular States"); Laurence H.

Only in Congress are the states represented in a way that reasonably assures consideration of their institutional interests."). John Nowak also argued, well before Seminole Tribe, that: [T]he Court should read the eleventh amendment as a direct limitation on its own powers, but should not interpret it as a limitation on congressional power. A congressional grant of jurisdiction allowing a suit by a citizen against a state indicates that Congress has determined that the federal policy is preeminent and that the hardship on the state is not severe. The states may adjust to the congressional enactment or, if the regulation proves onerous, they may exert their influence on Congress to have it changed. John E.

As Justice Stevens explains in his dissent in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents: The majority's view ... does not bolster the Framers' plan of structural safeguards for state interests. Rather, it is fundamentally at odds with that plan. Indeed, as Justice Breyer has explained, forbidding private remedies may necessitate the enlargement of the federal bureaucracy and make it more difficult "to decentralize governmental decisionmaking and to provide individual citizens, or local communities, with a variety of enforcement powers." 528 U.S. 62, 95 n.3 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting Coll.

One way, no doubt, is to read the Court as self-consciously balancing an arguably excessive grant of congressional power to regulate the states (as established by Garcia) with a corresponding diminution of congressional power to subject states to suit (as per Seminole Tribe and Alden).84 If this balancing of the regula- tory line of jurisprudence against the sovereign immunity line is indeed what is happening, then the Court's state immunity cases must be under- stood as simply ends-oriented. And if the Court is truly doing no more than manipulating the doctrine of sovereign immunity in a cynical man- ner, then the proposal set forth herein is surely quixotic. This Note presumes, however, that these two lines of jurisprudence may indeed be reconciled in a more principled way, and it attempts to do so by focusing on the Court's emphasis in both lines of cases on process concerns- specifically, on the necessity of maintaining transparent lines of political responsibility and accountability in the sovereign immunity context.85 B. Congressional Regulation Through the Creation of Non-Article III Courts Article III of the Constitution guarantees lifetime tenure and salary protection for judges of the Supreme Court and inferior courts of the nation.86 These provisions are meant to "protect the role of the indepen- dent judiciary within the constitutional scheme of tripartite government Amendment, but holding that Congress's attempt to abrogate state immunity from individual suit under the Act violates Eleventh Amendment); cf.

Rev. 819, 821 (1999), which argues that the Court should recognize that the textual source of state sovereignty is located in the use of the term "State" in the Constitution. 84. See Jay S.

Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.91 There the Court stated that there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of act- ing on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determina- tion, but which congress may or may not bring within the cogni- zance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.92 Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."

Marathon Pipe Line Co., though only by a plu- rality of the Court.94 If this definition of a public right were still operative, then the consti- tutional reach of legislative courts would remain short, and the very idea that a state might be held accountable before such a tribunal would be unimaginable. ButJustice O'Connor, who was responsible for one of the concurring votes in Northern Pipeline, brought forth a new definition of public rights several years later in Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.95 Remarking that "[a] n absolute construction of Article III is not possible in this area of 'frequently arcane distinctions and confusing precedents, " 96Justice O'Connor refused to uphold the Northern Pipeline Court's formalist approach to the public rights doctrine. Instead, she de- fended an expanded notion of "public rights" that "reflects simply a prag- matic understanding that when Congress selects a quasi-judicial method of resolving matters that 'could be conclusively determined by the Execu- tive and Legislative Branches,' the danger of encroaching on the judicial powers is reduced."97 Thus, if Congress can authorize an agency to fulfill its mandate without implicating Article III, then Congress may likewise adopt the more pragmatic and efficient approach of requiring private parties to resolve disputes between themselves in an Article I tribunal.98 The standard for determining whether or not Congress has vested improper powers in a non-Article III court was laid out explicitly in Com- claims created by the administrative state, by and against private persons"); Martin H.

Schor.99 Again adopting a pragmatic stance, the Court identified several factors to weigh in order to determine whether a legislative court was constitutionally constructed. The factors are: the extent to which the "essential attributes of judicial power" are reserved to Article III courts, and, conversely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the range of jurisdic- tion and powers normally vested only in Article III courts, the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article 111.100 Under the Schor and Thomas balancing test, therefore, Congress has great latitude to create legislative courts in which private parties may adjudicate statutorily-created rights. III. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND LEGISLATIVE COURTS This Note proposes that Congress may make the states subject to suits brought by individuals in non-Article III courts. This Part sketches out what such a scheme would look like, highlighting the type of mecha- nism that would be necessary to assure that politically accountable actors retain adequate discretion over any adjudicative proceedings within the agency. In particular, this Part recommends that Congress mandate that the head of the administrative agency sign off on any suit brought by an individual against a state before such a suit will be allowed to proceed in the agency's legislative court. Since the agency's head is answerable to the President, lines of responsibility will remain transparent, and respon- sibility for allowing such a proceeding to continue will be located in a politically accountable actor. While the mechanics of the proposal dis- cussed in this Part are generally applicable to any legislative court scheme, the discussion below will use the Fair Labor Standards Act-the federal statute at issue in Alden-as its model for how the proposal would work. A. Political Accountability Within the Administrative Agency In Alden v. Maine the Court made clear that private citizens may not bring suit against the states under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in either state or federal court. There is no question, however, that it is permissible for Congress to provide that the Secretary of Labor may bring suit against a state for violations of the FLSA. Indeed, the FLSA specifi- cally authorizes such suits,101 and the majority in Alden partly relied on 99. 478 U.S. 833 (1986). 100. Id. at 851 (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 54 (1932)). 101.

An action to recover the liability prescribed ... may</page><page sequence="23">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 875 this fact in its finding that there was no constitutional infirmity in pre- cluding state suability under the Act in either state or federal courts.'02 Allowing the Secretary to make such a decision appropriately "require[s] the exercise of political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a State,"'103 and accords with the political accountability concerns that have been latent in the Court's jurisprudence at least since United States v. Texas. The problem, as Congress itself has recognized, is that the Secre- tary of Labor was not originally envisioned, nor can she realistically be expected, to devote substantial resources to sue on behalf of aggrieved employees.'04 Once again the central dilemma reasserts itself: Individu- als may not bring suits against the states because the lines of political accountability will become muddied, yet the politically responsible fed- eral officer empowered to bring such suits does not have the practical resources to effectuate this duty. There is, however, a way out of this impasse. The Secretary of Labor may base her decision to bring suits against states on the complaints filed by individuals. Why, then, may not Congress set up an authority within the Department of Labor to adjudicate these same complaints? Garcia ex- plained that the federal government may regulate the states pursuant to the FLSA, and we know from Texas and Alden that the federal govern- ment may bring suit against a state, on behalf of an individual, for dam- ages resulting from a violation of the Act. As discussed above, this is ac- ceptable because the lines of political accountability run transparently between the federal government and the people: The Secretary of Labor be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competentjurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. 29 U.S.C. ? 216(b) (1994). A "public agency" is defined to include "the government of a State or political subdivision thereof; any agency of ... a State, or a political subdivision of a State." Id. ? 203 (x). The Secretary of Labor is authorized to bring an action on behalf of the employees: The Secretary may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages. . . . Any sums thus recovered by the Secretary of Labor on behalf of an employee pursuant to this subsection shall be held in a special deposit account and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary of Labor, directly to the employee or employees affected. Id. ? 216(c). As noted above, the Court held in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority that the FLSA's comprehension of the states within its regulatory sphere is constitutionally permitted. See supra notes 78-81 and accompanying text. And under United States v. Texas, the United States may bring suit on behalf of an individual whose federal statutory rights have been abridged. See supra notes 33-36 and accompanying text. 102. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 756 (1999). 103. Id. 104.

No. 93-690, at 27 (1974))).</page><page sequence="24">876 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:853 ultimately has the political responsibility for bringing suit against a state, and thus she and the President are directly accountable for the political fallout resulting from such a decision. So long, therefore, as the estab- lishment of authority to adjudicate these same claims within the Depart- ment of Labor, via a legislative court, remains subject to the same level of political transparency, such a scheme will respect the core concerns of the Court's majority in Alden. This Note thus proposes that Congress may set up an authority within the Department of Labor to adjudicate complaints by individuals against the states for violations of the FLSA, in essence abrogating the states' sovereign immunity in these legislative courts. There are three strands to this argument: (1) the right to overtime pay created by the FLSA is amenable, under the Court's current public rights doctrine, to adjudication in a legislative court; (2) sovereign immunity is a concept foreign to the administrative agency context, since legislative courts are more properly understood to be regulatory bodies rather than courts of law; and (3) the political safeguards that attend the Secretary of Labor's decision to bring suit against a state will remain in place, so long as the Secretary must predetermine whether there is a substantial basis for send- ing any particular action to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Moreo- ver, since the Department of Labor is already staffed with ALJs, recourse to a legislative-court regime for the disposition of FLSA claims against the states would be far less costly than requiring the Secretary of Labor to bring such suits herself on behalf of individuals.'05 B. The Amenability of FLSA Provisions to Adjudication in Legislative Courts Under the Court's current public rights doctrine, adjudication of rights such as those created by the overtime provisions of the FLSA are amenable to adjudication in legislative courts. Applying the Schor balanc- ing test, one first notes that the right to be adjudicated here is statutory in nature. Congress has created a right (to overtime pay) that did not here- tofore exist, at common law or otherwise. Since this is a statutory right, we need not be concerned that Congress has made an undue incursion into the realm of Article III courts, because the right is not one that has historically been adjudicated therein. Because the disposition of claims arising under this manufactured right could be decided by the executive 105. As Joanne Brant has argued, an individual's "attempt to persuade the federal government to sue on their behalf and to remit any damages the government recovers" would "likely ... screen out a significant number of viable claims, and will strain an already tight federal litigation budget, which has never contemplated that the Department of Labor would serve as the front line of FLSA enforcement." Joanne C. Brant, The Ascent of Sovereign Immunity, 83 Iowa L. Rev. 767, 815 (1998). The Department of Labor already employs ALJs, and the bureaucratic structure for litigating claims within the agency already exists. See Ronald A. Cass, Allocation of Authority Within Bureaucracies: Empirical Evidence and Normative Analysis, 66 B.U. L. Rev. 1, 18 (1986) (reporting that as of 1986 the Department of Labor employed sixty-six ALJs).</page><page sequence="25">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 877 or legislative branches without recourse to adjudication and without im- plicating Article 111,106 there is no danger that any due process right has been abridged by restricting adjudication to a legislative tribunal whose judges do not have salary protection or life tenure.107 The second element of the Schor test-the concern that drove Con- gress to depart from the requirements of Article III-is compelling here. Not only is the Secretary of Labor incapable of providing the optimal level of protection for private parties whose rights have been abridged,1' 8 but the goals of Congress in enacting the FLSA are imperiled by state noncompliance. Coupled with the typical justifications offered for dele- gating adjudicative power to legislative courts-administrative efficiency and expertise'09-this element weighs heavily in the constitutional balance.110 A somewhat more complicated question arises with respect to the third Schor prong: "the extent to which the 'essential attributes ofjudicial power' are reserved to Article III courts, and, conversely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts."'' A state brought before the FLSA legislative court by a private party could contend that its immunity remains intact before such a tribunal, because substantial su- pervision over the non-Article III tribunal by an Article III court is consti- tutionally required-and once Article III oversight is required, the state's immunity from suit is implicated. At one stage in the history of the Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, this argument might have been compelling."12 The Court's current jurisprudence, however, re- 106. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 50 (1932). 107. The rights to overtime pay and maximum working hours created under the FLSA fit squarely within the expanded definition of "public rights" that Justice O'Connor laid out in Thomas. See Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 589-94 (1985); see also supra notes 95-98 and accompanying text; cf. Martin H. Redish &amp; DanielJ. La Fave, Seventh Amendment Right to Jury Trial in Non-Article III Proceedings: A Study in Dysfunctional Constitutional Theory, 4 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 407, 425-26 (1995) (noting that the fraudulent-conveyance action at issue in Granfinanciera-which was there held to be a private right-"would easily fit under the Court's definition in Thomas of 'public right"'). 108. See supra note 104. 109. See Sward, supra note 88, at 1062. 110. Indeed, after laying out the balancing test in Schor, Justice O'Connor proceeded to address only the nature of the right at issue and the amount of Article III powers delegated to the legislative court; the concerns that drove Congress were tacitly presumed to be compelling. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851-59 (1986) (failing to address, in the context of the balancing test, Congress's reasons for creating the legislative court). 111. Id. at 851. 112. Under the Crowell or Northern Pipeline standards, for instance, the expansive vesting of typical Article III powers in a legislative court would be determinative that Congress's creation of the court was unconstitutional. See N. Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 81 (1982) (noting that "the functions of the adjunct must be limited in such a way that 'the essential attributes' ofjudicial power are retained in</page><page sequence="26">878 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:853 quires only de minimis judicial oversight of the proposed legislative court. 113 In Thomas, for example, the Court found constitutional a stat- ute that limited Article III review to matters of fraud, misconduct, or mis- representation."14 The need for Article III oversight has thus been greatly reduced and, to the extent that sovereign immunity is understood to be a doctrine operative only in a judicial context, state sovereign im- munity has been removed as a formal concern. C. The Distinct Status of Legislative Courts An obvious objection to allowing individuals to bring FLSA actions against states in legislative court is that such a scheme is merely an end- run around the Court's sovereign immunity doctrine."15 Sovereign im- the Art. III court"). This situation would have led congressional drafters intent on abrogating a state's immunity into a Catch-22: In order to create a legislative court that did not violate the Vestings Clause of Article III, a significant quantum of Article III oversight of the tribunal would be required. But in order to take a state's immunity off the table, Article III judicial oversight would have to be minimized. Given this predicament, it is unlikely that Congress would be able to construct a statute capable of satisfying these mutually incompatible constitutional requirements. 113. As discussed above, the Court has gone to pains to construe the reach of Northern Pipeline narrowly and to emphasize that Article III oversight is but one factor to be weighed in the balancing test approved in Schor. See, e.g., Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 584 (1985) (characterizing Northern Pipeline as "establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review" (emphasis added)). For a discussion of Court precedent after Northern Pipeline, see supra notes 95-100 and accompanying text. 114. Thomas, 473 U.S. at 592; cf. Peter L.

Rev. 189, 216-24 (1999) (arguing that sovereign immunity should not apply in qui tam actions where the United States has intervened, even if the United States is not the real party in interest). This Note's proposal-to allow individual suits against the states in legislative court-is conceptually distinct from qui tam actions. The legislative court proposal offers an alternative method for congressional regulation of the states, rather than an alternative method for the federal government to defend its own economic interests by authorizing an individual to bring suit in a judicial forum in the name of the United States. In the qui tam context, the qui tam relator would need to demonstrate that his or her pressing of a claim would result in some direct benefit to the government.

Surely one could convincingly contend that moving the adjudication from an Article III or state court to a legislative court should make no constitutional difference. As discussed above, however, there is a clear conceptual difference between legislative and judicial courts, even if the distinction between them has been a problem of a "highly theoretical nature" and "produc- tive of much confusion and controversy.""16 In the past, the Court has adopted a functional standard for determining whether an action before an agency is to be deemed a suit at law."17 But the current public rights doctrine requires a more formalist approach to this question, since the functions of judicial and legislative courts are presumed to be constitu- tionally discrete.118 Indeed, the premise of the Court's holdings in Thomas and Schor is that the difference between an administrative agency, which regulates directly, and a legislative court, which regulates through an adjudicative process, is constitutionally inconsequential.1"9 Given the doctrinal distinction between constitutional and legislative courts, the 116.

Rich, 135 U.S. 467, 477 (1890) ("The principle ... is, that a proceeding, not in a court of justice, but carried on by executive officers in the exercise of their proper functions, . . . is purely administrative in its character, and cannot, in any just sense, be called a suit."). In support of the functional standard, see, for example, Redish &amp; La Fave, supra note 107, at 433, noting that, "[w]hile administrative rulemaking obviously does not qualify as a 'suit,' it would defy all reality to suggest that administrative adjudication of a statutorily created cause of action on behalf of or against a private individual or entity does not constitute a 'suit."' 118. See Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Of Legislative Courts, Administrative Agencies, and Article III, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 916, 928 (1988) (arguing that "from the perspective of article III, [there is] no difference in constitutional principle between legislative courts and administrative agencies"); Redish, Legislative Courts, supra note 92, at 201 (noting that the Court "cannot logically distinguish the work of non-article III legislative courts from that of administrative adjudicatory bodies," since "their work cannot be functionally or theoretically distinguished"); cf.

Saab Cars USA, Inc., 26 F.3d 1259, 1263 (3d Cir. 1994) (explaining that Court decisions from the era of Upshur did not adopt a "functional test"). 119. As Professors Redish and La Fave explain: [An] administrative agency-legislative court dichotomy could not be rationalized by resort to the public rights doctrine, because that doctrine draws no such distinction for purposes of Article III analysis. In its original context, that doctrine was developed for the sole purpose of distinguishing between Article III and non-Article III adjudicatory power. Redish &amp; La Fave, supra note 107, at 434.

The Court has adopted just such a formal approach in other, non- sovereign immunity, areas of the law. For example, the Court has refused to find a Seventh Amendment defect in the refusal of Congress to permit juries to be seated in non-Article III courts. As the Court explained in Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, where a Seventh Amendment claim was brought in the context of a non-Article III bankruptcy court, "if Congress may assign the adjudication of a statutory cause of action to a non-Article III tribunal, then the Seventh Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder."120 Similarly, in NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., the Court held that the Seventh Amendment "does not apply where the proceeding [an adjudication under the NLRA] is not in the nature of a suit at common law."'21 Again, given the constitutional distinction between legislative and judicial courts, these holdings cannot be surprising.'22 It therefore follows that the non-Article III tribunal, as a creature of Congress and a tool of the President, should properly remain subject to the control of the elected branches of government, and not be answerable to doctrines like sover- eign immunity that have been developed within a judicial context. 120. 492 U.S. at 53-54. The Court in Granjinanciera found, however, that a jury trial was required in the instant case since a private right was at issue.

Necessity of a Filtering Mechanism A proposal to allow states to be "sued" in legislative courts will ini- tially appear at odds with Alden's claim that the "logic" of its sovereign immunity decisions "does not turn on the forum in which the suits were prosecuted."'23 But if the Court's underlying rationale is to assure that accountability and responsibility remain in the political branches of gov- ernment, then the location of a suit in a political forum-the legislative court-affords precisely the respect for the states' political functioning demanded by the Court.'24 Since adjudications within an independent regulatory agency do not implicate either the state or federal judiciary, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not violated. Abrogating state sovereign immunity in legislative courts would af- ford the kind of political accountability that the Alden Court seeks and that is present when the Secretary of Labor is required to initiate a suit herself. We understand the actions of the Secretary of Labor to be sub- ject to popular correction because the Secretary is a delegate of the Presi- dent, the elected representative of the people. The President is directly accountable to the people for his actions and those of his delegates, since he is responsible under Article II for faithfully executing the laws and for "directing the action to be taken by his executive subordinates" to protect the national interest.'25 The President maintains control over the Secre- 123.

Prior to the Court's decision in Alden, judges and commentators had assumed that allowing the states to be sued in their own courts would comport with respect for the dignity of the states. See, e.g., O'Brien v. Vermont (In re O'Brien), 216 B.R. 731, 736 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1998) (characterizing as "Chicken Littles" those who believe that state violations of bankruptcy laws will not be remediable, since "[w]hen a federal statute 'impose[s] liability upon the States, the Supremacy Clause makes that statute the law in every State, fully enforceable in state court"' (quoting Hilton v. S.C. Public Rys. Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 207 (1991))); Ellen D. Katz, State Judges, State Officers, and Federal Commands After Seminole Tribe and Printz, 1998 Wis. L.

J. 151, 152 (1998) (suggesting that Seminole Tribe would require bankruptcy proceedings against states to proceed in state courts, and that it would be "a viable, although somewhat undesirable, alternative"); Monaghan, Exception, supra note 17, at 122 ("In the main, the Eleventh Amendment is concerned only with forum selection: should states be sued in state or federal courts?"); James E.

Rev. 161, 165 (1998) (arguing that Seminole Tribe Court's interpretation of Eleventh Amendment "does not absolutely bar federal cognizance but simply shifts or allocates claims against the states away from federal trial courts and into state trial courts as courts of first instance"). These scholars could not, of course, have anticipated the Court's decision in Alden and its emphasis on political accountability concerns. 125. Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 134 (1926). The President is ordinarily assumed to be politically responsible for the actions of his officers. See, e.g., id. at 132 ("The highest and most important duties which [the President's] subordinates perform</page><page sequence="30">882 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:853 tary (and all his delegates) through his removal powers.'26 Since Article I judges are also executive functionaries, they too are subject to the control of the President through his removal powers. To some extent, therefore, the actions of ALJs must be understood to be political in nature. The President, that is, maintains control over the legislative courts, and is ulti- mately responsible for their functioning. There are, however, limits on the President's removal power with re- spect to ALJs.127 The President cannot, for example, influence an ALJ during an adjudication. As Chief Justice Taft suggested in Myers: [T]here may be duties of a quasijudicial character imposed on executive officers and members of executive tribunals whose de- cisions after hearing affect interests of individuals, the discharge of which the President can not in a particular case properly in- fluence or control. But even in such a case he may consider the decision after its rendition as a reason for removing the officer, on the ground that the discretion regularly entrusted to that officer by statute has not been on the whole intelligently or wisely exercised.128 The President cannot himself direct the outcome of an adjudication-a commonsensical and presumably uncontroversial restriction on his re- moval powers. But does this necessarily mean that the President cannot be held accountable for the judgments emanating from an administrative agency? Would a delegation of power from the Secretary of Labor to a legislative court necessarily entail the loss of political accountability in the person of the President? The short answer to these questions is that dele- gated power need not entail a loss of accountability. First, the President is capable of influencing, in broad strokes, the manner and substance of the decisionmaking in the legislative court by policing its decisionmakers. Those ALJs who refuse to share the Presi- dent's interpretation of how the law is to be executed will be dismissed, and those ALJs who remain will be on notice that the retention of their positions is conditional. While such influence over administrative adjudi- cation might appear unseemly, this kind of political intrusion on the pro- cess is an anticipated and welcome characteristic of the legislative court. are those in which they act for him. In such cases they are exercising not their own but his discretion."). 126. See id. at 161; cf. Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 666 (1997) (holding that non-Article III judges on Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals were inferior officers of the United States and thus subject to removal by the President without any restriction); Freytag v. Comm'r, 501 U.S. 868, 912 (1991) (Scalia,J., concurring) (arguing that Article I Tax Court is not a court of law since its judges "still lack life tenure; their salaries may still be diminished; they are still removable by the President for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office"' (quoting 26 U.S.C. ? 7443(f))). 127. See generally Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 691 (1988) (holding that Congress may restrict President's removal power if the restrictions are not "of such a nature that they impede the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty" to take care that the laws be faithfully executed). 128. Myers, 272 U.S. at 135 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="31">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 883 Recall that these tribunals are political bodies, and that adjudications therein are regulatory rather than judicial in nature. Article Ijudges lack the salary protection and life tenure of Article III judges, precisely be- cause we insist that these executive branch functionaries answer to the President and, ultimately, to the people. If the people are dissatisfied with the number of lawsuits that the Secretary of Labor allows to proceed against the states, or with the relative ease or difficulty of gaining relief in an administrative court, they can express their discontent at the next na- tional election. And if the states are concerned that they will not be af- forded the benefits which accrue from having a proceeding adjudicated by an Article III judge, all they need do is remove the proceeding to fed- eral district court-where they will, perforce, have waived their claim of immunity. Second, Congress may provide a threshold political check on whether an individual's claim against a state may proceed by requiring that the Secretary of Labor issue a certificate of probable cause before allowing the claim to proceed to adjudication. Given that the Secretary of Labor is the President's subordinate, the President will bear responsi- bility for the issuance of such a certificate. This screening function will ensure political accountability, for it entrenches a high-level deliberative process through the exercise of executive discretion. E. Some Objections to the Legislative Court Proposal It is not difficult to imagine objections to a proposal to abrogate state sovereign immunity in legislative courts. After all, as has already been noted, the Alden Court specifically explained that state immunity is a "background principle" of our constitutional order, and that the logic of the Court's immunity jurisprudence does not "turn on the forum" in which suit is brought.129 If the lesson to be gleaned from Alden is simply that the states are not to be sued without their consent, then any parsing of the reasoning behind the Court's decision is ultimately in vain. To the extent that the issues raised by this Note have been addressed in analogous contexts, the courts superficially appear to have adopted this straightforward approach to the question of state suability in non- Article III courts. For example, in the wake of Seminole Tribe a number of states successfully claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings, even though bankruptcy courts are non-Article III tribunals, arguably beyond the Amendment's ambit.'30 129. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 733 (1999). 130. See Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Bd. (In re Mitchell), 209 F.3d 1111, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000); NVR Homes, Inc. v. Clerks of the Circuit Courts (In re NVR, LP), 189 F.3d 442, 448-49 (4th Cir. 1999); In re Sacred Heart Hosp., 133 F.3d 237, 239 (3d Cir. 1998). But see Samuel L. Bufford, Seminole Tribe May Not Apply to Bankruptcy Courts, 6 Consumer Bankr. News, Apr. 10, 1997, at 3 (arguing that Eleventh Amendment does not apply to bankruptcy courts because as non-Article III courts they do not exercise the judicial power of the United States). Joanne Brant has also noted that:</page><page sequence="32">884 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:853 Those courts that have addressed the question of state immunity in bank- ruptcy actions have focused on the nature of the proceeding rather than on the forum in which the adjudication was located. Thus, the question of state immunity was reduced in these cases to an analysis of whether the state had been coerced to appear before the bankruptcy court, and whether the substance of the remedy sought by the individual would re- quire invasion of the state's treasury.'3' Such an approach has superficial appeal. It seems to accord with the thrust of both Seminole Tribe and Alden that individuals simply may not sue the states. The context of bankruptcy proceedings is, however, distinct in important ways from the scheme proposed in this Note. For instance, the statute creating the bankruptcy courts makes explicit that these tribunals are functionally to serve as the tools of Article III district courts,'32 with the result that, unlike in legislative courts, the doctrine of sovereign im- munity remains both functionally and formally relevant in such proceed- ings. More to the point for purposes of this Note, the bankruptcy court system has not been devised with an eye toward assuring that ultimate responsibility for its dispositions comes to rest on a politically accountable actor. There is no mechanism in the bankruptcy context for assuring that the President, his officers, or their delegates exercise their discretion transparently. There are no checks or safeguards to assure that the lines of political accountability remain unmuddied. To the degree such trans- parency and accountability truly provide the substantive rationale for the Supreme Court's state immunity jurisprudence, the argument that state immunity can be abrogated in the bankruptcy courts simply falls short. The court rulings on sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy context thus do not provide evidence that this Note's proposal to abrogate state immu- nity in legislative courts is misguided. Rather, the bankruptcy cases serve to highlight the importance of the key conceptual component of this pro- posal: the need to build political responsibility, transparency, and ac- countability into the structure of the administrative agency and its legisla- tive court. One final approach, which has not yet been presented to a court, is the radical argument that as a bankruptcy court is an Article I court, it does not exercise "federal judicial power" and is thus not restricted by the Eleventh Amendment. The implications of this argument are extraordinary. If accepted, then any Article I court-including ... the myriad federal agencies authorized to resolve disputes involving "public rights"-would be unfettered by the Eleventh Amendment. Brant, supra note 105, at 827. 131. See, e.g., In re NVR, 189 F.3d at 452. 132. 28 U.S.C. ? 151 (1994) ("In each judicial district, the bankruptcy judges in regular active service shall constitute a unit of the district court to be known as the bankruptcy court for that district."); see also Pitts v. Ohio Dep't of Taxation (In Re Pitts), 241 B.R. 862, 867 n.l (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1999) (opining that it is "unlikely" that Judge Bufford's "argument will prevail as 28 U.S.C. ? 151 provides that bankruptcy courts will function as a 'unit' of the Article III district courts").</page><page sequence="33">2001] ABROGATING STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 885 Of course, should the Court decide that it no longer wishes to re- spect its Garcia holding in the FLSA context, or should it scale back the muscular public rights doctrine it has set forth in Schor and Thomas, or should it even disavow the political-accountability reasoning for its sover- eign immunity decisions in Alden, then the legislative court solution might prove untenable. But given the Court's current approach to these vexing constitutional questions, this Note's proposal offers a remedy for state violations of federal rights where none existed before. It respects both the formal and functional concerns that the Court has emphasized in its sovereign immunity case law. It spares the Secretary of Labor from having to devote the Department's finite resources to litigating claims on behalf of individuals. It maintains transparent lines of political accounta- bility between the people and the President. It respects the core of the Court's regulatoryjurisprudence. And it respects the central concerns of the Court in its state sovereign immunity jurisprudence. CONCLUSION This Note has argued that abrogation of state sovereign immunity in non-Article III courts falls well within the borders of constitutional doc- trine laid out by the Supreme Court. Given the premises that the federal government may regulate the states, that Congress may create non-Article III courts for the efficient administration of its regulatory programs, and that private rights may be adjudicated in these courts, the propriety of subjecting the states to suit in such tribunals seems clear. The more difficult question is whether this proposal comports with the spirit of the Constitution and the nation's federalist structure. This Note has identified the Court's compelling policy justification for main- taining a robust state immunity doctrine: that political accountability must be located in the elected branches of government, and that the gov- ernmental actors responsible for placing the state treasuries at risk must be clearly discernible. In demonstrating that the legislative court, as a creature of Congress and tool of the President, provides for such account- ability, this Note concludes that Congress's creation of such a court would indeed comport with the spirit of both the Constitution and our federal- ism. This proposal thus demonstrates that concerns for procedural fair- ness and federalism may be reconciled, and that, with respect to state violations of federal law, it is possible to respect both the constitutional principle of state sovereignty and the equally compelling principle of the rule of law.</page></plain_text>
