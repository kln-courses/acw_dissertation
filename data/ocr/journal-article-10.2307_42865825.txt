MILLER UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS Introduction jAllthough no student of economics the world over fails to consider Marxism and its possible influence on our contemporary economy, few Americans and fewer English economists know Thorstein Vehlen well, and he is virtually unknown in Continental Europe and the rest of the world. Vehlen had practically no followers until near the end of his career in 1929, just before the great crash in the stock market, but since his death there has been increasing interest in his criticism of the price system supported today by capitalism. Offhand, it seems natural to conclude that Veblen and Marx offer the same criticism of capitalism, namely, that capitalism contains a conflict of the forces of production. Many conclude that Veblen, like Marx, is in prin- ciple a thoroughgoing crass materialist and that the economic theories of these men emerge from the same philosophic roots. We intend to show that such is not the case, that Veblen is not a Marxian materialist, that he does not employ the Hegelian dialectic as a method of explaining economic proc- esses, and that Veblen believes individual men are purposeful, that their purposes make the economic processes teleological, in contrast to the Marx- ian view that all of history can be interpreted in terms of impersonal, de- spiritualized, nonteleological material forces over which, finally, men have no control. Whereas orthodox economists attribute the profits of high finance to the management of the entrepreneurial genius, and Marx attri- butes them to the product of labor, Veblen believes that science and tech- nology are the more essential causes of the tremendous surpluses and pos- sible profits. Both Veblen and Marx believe that the seeds of capitalistic disintegra- tion are contained within the internal stresses and strains of the system itself. Both view the technological or productive forces of society as the ultimately molding or determinative causes of social movement and change. Both share a "scientific outlook," that is, the rejection of "supernaturalism" for a mat-</page><page sequence="2">166 THE SOUTHWESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY ter-of-fact approach in the explanation of experiential phenomena. Such affinities in approach and conclusions have led some to infer that there re- mains little significant difference between the views of these two intellectual radicals.1 Max Lerner even goes so far as to suggest that Vehlens own criti- cisms of Marx and Marxism were due perhaps in part to a feeling of neces- sity to maintain what academic standing he had attained: " 'No one who reads Mr. Dorfman' s book, with its story of the bitterness of Veblen's life until he succeeded in getting some small academic foothold, can wonder that even when his own thought was closest to the Marxian categories he chose to clothe them in other terms/'2 Obviously there is room for comparison of Marx and Veblen, but in the fundamental assumptions and attitudes of these two revolutionaries are discrepancies that can never be reconciled. It is with these basic similarities and differences that we are concerned here. Although this article is not in- tended to be an exposition of economic concepts or policies, it is intended to be a discussion of the fundamental metaphysical and methodological commitments of Veblen in relation to those of Karl Marx, and to restrict the examination to the philosophical commitments in so far as that is pos- sible. Discussion of economic analysis is incidental to the main argument and is introduced only for purposes of illustration. Dialectic versus Cumulative Causation Abram Harris makes the statement that "like Marx, Veblen was a critic and historian of capitalism."3 Within this short statement is compressed the superstructure for misconceptions. It is true that Marx is a critic and his- torian of capitalism, but Veblen is much more than this. Although the bat- tery of his categories of analysis is turned most devastatingly on current eco- nomic and social policies, his approach is not limited to one phase of man's history but is designed to explain community development in general. Marx's economic analysis, though in line with the classical tradition, was inspired by a socialist zeal for institutional change. He differs from classical thought in that he sees economics as an evolutionary science, with "laws" applicable for only a limited time. With the exception of that of John Stuart Mill, classical economic thought has been concerned with the dis- covery of eternal universal laws. Marx uses such classical economic theories, developed in support of capitalism and the capitalistic class, to support his 1 See especially chapter v, "Professor Veblen," in Henry L.

Marx finds the source of social change in the forces of production. These he conceives of as fundamentally and resolutely in conflict with economic phenomena or relations of production in the cur- rent stage of society. The classical economists had conceived of exchange within the capitalistic economy as essentially a "commodity-money-com- modity" transaction, that is, commodities produced and exchanged for money in order to purchase other commodities. Marx points out that this is simply not the case. Capitalism is actually a M^-C-M., economy where C (the commodity) is the medium of exchange, and the aim is not to acquire commodities but to so complete the transaction as to make M2 exceed M1 by some amount ( AM).5 In other words, Marx explains that the goal of capi- talistic enterprise is profit-making or capital accumulation. He discards the classical concepts of "postponed consumption," "abstinence," etc. The con- tinued existence of capitalism depends on maintaining these value-and- wage-determining processes in a relationship conducive to capital accumula- tion. He believes that inherent in these relations, however, are internal in- consistencies and inevitable consequences detrimental to general human welfare. The result is the division of modern society into two classes with irreconcilable economic interests. And although "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," Marx sees that "our epoch of the bourgeoisie possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simpli- fied the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great classes directly facing each other - bourgeoisie and prole- tariat."6 The ultimate and inevitable resolution of this class conflict Marx sees in the classless society of pure communism. It is this inevitability and the de- 4 Marx used Locke's labor theory to condemn private property. He used Smith's equating of exchange value to labor cost as the basis of his charge of exploitation; this, coupled with Senior's argument against a shorter working day, furnished the basis for his concept of surplus value; and the absolute oversupply of labor put forth by Malthus, Marx modifies to a relative oversupply arising in competition between the labor force and substitutes for labor. Veblen, noting Marx's classical ties, says: "The system of doctrines worked out by Marx is charac- terized by a certain boldness of conception and a great logical consistency. Taken in detail, the constituent elements of the system are neither novel nor iconoclastic, nor does Marx at any point claim to have discovered previously hidden facts or to have invented recondite formulations of facts already known; but the system as a whole has an air of originality and initiative such as is rarely met with among the sciences that deal with any phase of human culture." - Thorstein Veblen, The Place of Science in Modern Civilisation (New York, B.

Marx sees institu- tions and values as being absolutely determined by the level and stage of development of man's productive instruments : What is society, whatever its form may be? The product of men's reciprocal ac- tion. Are men free to choose this or that form of society for themselves ? By no means. Assume a particular state of development in the productive forces of man and you will get a particular form of commerce and consumption. Assume par- ticular stages of development in production, commerce and consumption and you will have a corresponding social structure, a corresponding organisation of the family, of orders or of classes, in a word, a corresponding civil society. Presup- pose a particular civil society and you will get particular political conditions which are only the official expression of civil society.7 The distinguishing feature of the Marxian dialectic of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis and Marxian economic determinism, which receives Veblen's criticism and accentuates their divergent positions, is Marx's failure to recon- cile the materialistic and spiritual,8 the determinant and indeterminant as- pects of man's world of experience. Marx is guilty of the same metaphysical fallacy as Hegel. Hegelian materialism differs from Hegelian orthodoxy, says Veblen, "by inverting the main logical sequence, riot by discarding the logic or resorting to new tests of truth or finality."9 Where Hegel pro- nounces his dictum "Das Denken ist das Sein," Marx would substitute "Das Sein macht das Denken In both cases, however, the creative primacy as- signed to one or the other member of the complex is much the same, "and in neither case is the relation between the two members a causal relation."10 In the case of Marx, the spiritual is merely the reflection of the material: In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their liv- ing, they change all their social relations. The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist.11 The movement or progress in both Hegelian and Marxian theories is a gradual advance toward a goal; it is a development or realization in explicit 7 Karl Marx, "Letter from Marx to P.

Cited hereafter as Poverty of Philosophy. 8 By "spiritual" we refer to what man thinks, the mental side of experience. This is the sense in which Veblen used the term in similar context. 9 Veblen, Place of Science , 4 14. 10 "In the materialistic conception man's spiritual life - what man thinks - is a reflex of what he is in the material respect, very much in the same fashion as the orthodox Hegelian would make the material world a reflection of the spirit."

In both, the movement is conceived of as the self-conditioned and self-acting unfold- ing of inner necessity, rendering future prediction in terms of certainty merely a matter of accountancy. Such a view of the universe is simply out- moded, says Veblen: Of the two postulates of earlier modern science, - the quantitative equivalence and the qualitative equivalence of cause and effect, - the former has come prac- tically to signify the balanced articulation of the process of cumulative change; the endeavor of the Positivists to erect this canon of quantitative equivalence into the sole canon of scientific truth, and so to reduce scientific theory to a sys- tem of accountancy, having failed. The latter thesis, that like causes produce like effects, or that the effect is, in some sense, of the same character as the cause, has fallen into decay as holding true only in such tenuously general terms as to leave it without particular force.12 According to Veblen, the basic inconsistency of Marx arises from a basic metaphysical fallacy. In the Marxian system the dialectical movement be- comes the class struggle, and although the class struggle is conceived to be "material," the term "material" can be considered only in a metaphorical sense. It does not mean mechanical, physical, or even physiological; it means economic; it is material "in the sense that it is a struggle between classes for the material means of life."13 Thus Veblen says: The dialectic of the movement of social progress, therefore, moves on the spiritual plane of human desire and passion, not on the (literally) material plane of me- chanical and physiological stress, on which the developmental process of brute creation unfolds itself. It is a sublimated materialism, sublimated by the domi- nating presence of the conscious human spirit, but it is conditioned by the mate- rial facts of the production of the means of life. The ultimately active forces in- volved in the process of unfolding social life are (apparently) the material agen- cies engaged in the mechanics of production; but the dialectic of the process - the class struggle - runs its course only among and in terms of the secondary (epi- genetic) forces of human consciousness engaged in the valuation of the material products of industry. A consistently materialistic conception, consistently adher- ing to a materialistic interpretation of the process of the development as well as of the facts involved in the process, could scarcely avoid making its putative dia- lective struggle a mere unconscious and irrelevant conflict of brute material forces. This would have amounted to an interpretation in terms of opaque cause and effect, without recourse to the concept of a conscious class struggle, and it might have led to a concept of evolution similar to the unteleological Darwinian con- cept of natural selection.14 Veblen thinks the fault of Marx is not that he believes material factors 12 The Theory of Business Enterprise (New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932), 370- 71. 13 Place of Science, 415. 14 Ibid., 415-16.</page><page sequence="6">170 THE SOUTHWESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY are essential to the economic processes but that he is inconsistent in trying to reduce and assimilate ideas and purposes (mental factors) to matter per se; he assimilates effects to causes by the blatant quantitative method. Marx declares his faith and then commits heresy in seeking an efficient instru- ment for its fulfillment. Marx recognizes human consciousness as a force in the movement of process, but he fails to make room for the indetermi- nancy of individual consciousness that would have accounted for progress in process. Rather he maintains that ideas are predetermined on the basis of the nature of matter and material forces. He attempts to locate the teleologi- ca! source of action outside of man and thus indulges in just as unscientific a supernaturalism as is found in idealism. In merging the philosophy of nat- ural rights and the categories of idealism with a crass materialism, Marx has made teleology impossible; there is no foundation for a class consciousness as the source of change in a complete determinism.15 Veblen sees the world as teleological because of man; Marx sees man's development as progressive because of the "teleological" bent of the material, nonhuman world. Marx thus expresses the same anthropomorphic bias as traditional idealism and thus makes the world a going concern, established for man's eventual well- being.16 In speaking of Marx's theory of value and its corollaries - the doc- trines of exploitation of labor by capital, and the laborer's claim to the whole of his labor - Veblen points out that these doctrines are "nothing but a development of the conceptions of natural rights which then pervaded 15 In speaking of the class solidarity that will arise out of common economic class interests and the class struggle that Marx describes as proceeding until it shall put an end to the diversity of economic interests on which the class struggle rests, Veblen says: "All this is logically consistent and convincing, but it proceeds on the ground of reasoned conduct, cal- culus of advantage, not on the grounds of cause and effect. The class struggle so conceived should always and everywhere tend unremittingly toward the socialistic consummation, and should reach that consummation in the end, whatever obstructions or diversions might retard the sequence of development along the way. Such is the notion of it embodied in the system of Marx. Such, however, is not the showing of history. . . . Those nations and civilisations which have decayed and failed, as nearly all known nations and civilisations have done, illustrate the point that however reasonable and logical the advance by means of the class struggle may be, it is by no means inevitable. Under the Darwinian norm it must be held that men's reasoning is largely controlled by other than logical, intellectual forces; that the conclusion reached by public or class opinion is as much, or more, a matter of sentiment than logical inference; and that the sentiment which animates men, singly or collectively, is as much, or more, an outcome of habit and native propensity as of calculated material interests." - Ibid., 441. 16 It is difficult to see on what basis social evolution takes place, once the conflict of class interest is resolved. The Marxian system of dialectic would no longer apply. Marx notes this but does not give any detailed prophecy of how social progress will continue. His implication seems to be a social evolution along the line of Veblen' s concept of technological advance: "It is only in the order of things in which there are no more classes and class antagonisms that social evolutions will cease to be political revolutions - Karl Marx, Poverty of Philoso- phy, 147.</page><page sequence="7">VEBLEN'S NATURALISM VERSUS MARXIAN MATERIALISM 171 English speculation and afforded the metaphysical ground of the liberal movement."17 The concept of the class struggle, which is certainly not Darwinian, is also not legitimately Hegelian. Hegel's concept of "the great man," the in- dividual conscious of the direction and flow of history and its carrier, can hardly be construed as a class-conscious minority; and most certainly Hegel thought of this consciousness and drive as something quite different from personal interest arising out of economic conflict. There is, moreover, in the Marxian concept a coincidence of historical movement and proletariat in- terests, in which the proletariat are a kind of "chosen people." Actually, as Veblen points out, the concept of the class struggle is of utilitarian origin and of English pedigree borrowed from the Benthamite system of self- interest. It is a piece of hedonism and "proceeds on the grounds of the hedonistic calculus which is equally foreign to the Hegelian notion of an unfolding process and to the post-Darwinian notions of cumulative causa- tion."18 In the Darwinian scheme, which Veblen accepts as equivalent to "science," there is no warrant for asserting a priori that the class interest of the working class will bring it to instigate a revolt against the propertied class.19 Moreover, there is no evidence for assuming any final or perfect social form, and certainly no definite equilibrium.20 In contrast to Marx, the most that Veblen' s categories of social evolution will permit him to predict of capitalistic enterprise is some future industrial stalemate. But even here there is no timetable or categorical prediction of the ultimate outcome : In effect, the progressive advance of this industrial system towards an all- inclusive mechanical balance of inter-locking processes appears to be approaching a critical pass, beyond which it will no longer be practical to leave its control in the hands of business men working at cross purposes for private gain, or to en- trust its continued administration to others than suitably trained technological experts, production engineers without a commercial interest. What these men will then do with it all is not so plain; the best they can do may not be good enough, but the negative proposition is becoming sufficiently plain, that this mechanical state of the industrial arts will not long tolerate the continued control of produc- tion by the vested interests under the current business-like rule of incapacity by advisement.21 17 Place of Science , 412. 18 Ibid., 418. 19 Veblen, emphasizing the lack of certainty in predictions of social trends and the general indeterminancy in human progress, says that "it may well be their training in subservience [the working class] to their employers will bring them again to realize the equity and excellence of the established system of subjection and unequal distribution of weath."

But what that change is to be will be determined by a process of selective adaptation of temperament and habits of thought on a social level, and in terms of those guides and standards that represent social values. Such change may take the form of a soviet of engineers, as Veblen postulates in The Engineers and the Price System , or it may take the form of a business-oriented fascism which, he points out in Absentee Ownership , is a possibility, for, as he says, in the "immediate future the prospect appears to offer a fuller confirmation in the faith that business prin- ciples answer all things."22 Even though contradictions of interests may ac- tually exist, the " 'institutional structure of society subsists and men live within its lines, with more or less questioning, it is true, but with more acquiescence than dissent."23 Attitudes and Implications Considering the ferocity of Veblen's attack on Marxian doctrine, one could easily ask how it can be said that there is any common ground. Indeed, how could Max Lerner infer, as has already been stated, that Veblen at- tacked Marx primarily on grounds of expediency to obscure ideological affinities? Actually, the sharpness of Veblen' s criticism is perhaps due in part to the large area of common ground shared by the two systems of thought. It might be recalled that during the days of the active Inquisition the church burned heretics at stake quite indiscriminately but seldom burned pagans who might be open to conversion. One of the strange dichotomies of human nature is the kindly generosity we bestow on those "who simply do not understand" in contrast to the bitter reproach we heap on those who share a general attitude with us yet "will not see the truth under their very noses!" The thinking of both Marx and Veblen reflects the currents of thought abroad in the nineteenth century. Both view man's life and history as process, process in which the economic factors of man's society are seen as of basic importance. The stresses and strains of a society torn between tra- ditional relations and technology, and caught up in a growing antagonism of new class-relations, gave the impetus for their anticapitalistic attitude. Both sought an explanation of current conditions and looked forward to some resolution of the conflicts of interests. Their explanatory principles and categories of evaluation differ, as has been shown in the previous pages, but what of the ultimate resolutions and implications? Actually, so far as 22 Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times (New York, B. W. Huebsch, Inc., 1923), 445. 23 Essays in Our Changing Order . Ed. Leon Ardzrooni (New York, B. w. Huebsch, Inc., 1923), 143.</page><page sequence="9">VEBLEN'S NATURALISM VERSUS MARXIAN MATERIALISM 173 Vehlen is concerned, the answer can be only a matter of speculation. In his writings he preferred to focus on social movement and economic substance rather than on political form. His analysis of the American situation as a conflict of pecuniary and industrial institutions is a far more accurate an- alysis than Marx's concept of sharply drawn classes. Moreover, it makes possible the resolution of interests in terms of modification, emergence, and cumulative change rather than a head-on clash of interests as was demanded in the system of Marx. Much has been made of Veblen's hypothesis in The Engineers and the Price System; but for all that, it remains a hypothesis, not a political plan for revolution.24 Veblen's treatment of communism in his editorials and articles for Dial shows a clear sympathy for its economic policies but disregards its politics as of no crucial interest for the time be- ing.25 As was the case with so many liberal thinkers in the America of his day, he was vitally interested in a new sociological experiment. It would be tragic and stupid to condemn Veblen for failing to evaluate correctly the seeds of tyranny scattered in the muck of the Russian Revolution.26 His sympathetic hope for a new formula to turn the tremendous productive ca- pacity of modern technology to the common good may have been misplaced; but no one who adequately understands his concept of science and the feeble but constructive role of human intelligence in social progress could accuse 24 Veblen's theme here is much the same as is found in Absentee Ownership, The Vested Interests and the Common Man , An Inquiry into the Nature of Peace and the Terms of its Perpetuation , etc., except with a different center of emphasis. Here Veblen deals primarily with the vested interests of investment banking. The familiar distinction between pecuniary interests and industrial welfare is here used to show the two pillars of corporate business to be the corps of industrial experts and those large financial concerns that control the "necessary funds" for industrial operations. The role of financial power is actually a ceremonial rite, says Veblen, necessary only because of the existing system of production for profit. The role of the engineers, however, is "real"; that is, it has a genuinely matter-of-fact basis. Capacity production through technological efficiency and direction are the "logical" goals of the engineer and are in harmony with community welfare. Personal gain through the restriction of production is the goal of the financial interests and is achieved, says Veblen, by effective sabotage of the material welfare of the community. The engineers are in the peculiar position of being an indispensable "pillar of production for profit," yet as members of the general community their material welfare is being sabotaged by those they help maintain. Veblen's simple and "reasonable" solution is a general strike of the engineers with a reorganization of production control under the guidance of the engineers for the maximum material welfare of the whole community. 25 Reprinted in Essays in Our Changing Order. 26 It should be remembered that Veblen wrote of Russian communism from 1919 to 1923. Alexander Kerensky, in speaking of the fall of his democratic regime to the Bolshevistic forces, noted that at the time, they had more popular support than his own middle-of-the-road administration. "Our administration had lost touch with the people," said Kerensky. A philosophy, which declared the institution of the State to be inherently evil and an instru- ment of oppression, expressed exactly the feelings of the people toward the former Czar's government and seemed to many the only instrument for speedy and sweeeping reforms. (The above opinion was expressed by Alexander Kerensky in lectures given at the University of Kansas City in a course entitled "The World Crisis," in the Spring semester of 1947.)</page><page sequence="10">174 THE SOUTHWESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY him of approving an authoritarian civil order. He leaves himself open to such charges by not stating, explicitly, his essential belief in man, man's capacity for intelligent action, and, even more important, his concept of the relentless and accumulative bettering of man's relation to his world by the blind and neutral process of institutional selective adaptation. Veblen explains man's actions on a collective level in terms of cause-and- effect analysis, thus making possible the prediction of social trends; yet this does not involve him in the metaphysical morass of determinism. Determin- ism is restricted to levels of action; indeterminism is a phenomenon of the interaction of levels. Marx attempts to formulate categories of analysis that would explain the process of man's social development within certain estab- lished class relationships. Veblen assumes with Aristotle that man is neces- sarily a social animal, and he seeks to explain the general process of social development and the role of individual reflective intelligence that con- tributes progress to that process. Institutional analysis is the conceptual foundation of Veblen's approach, for the social institution is the end product of the general process of value formation. Does this involve Veblen in some ultimate dualism? Yes. For the novel emergence of man's reflective intelligencce has involved the world in an ontologically real dualism. Recognition of man's capacity for mentally com- pressing the past and future into a present reflective analysis has destroyed forever the concept of quantitative equivalence as an adequate description of reality and explanation of change. Veblen's recognition of the nature of this process is a contribution to the scope of scientific methodology making possible the incorporation of novelty, qualitative change, and time as cate- gories of scientific formulation. Can this skeptic, the iconoclast Veblem, be accused of voicing a faith - a faith in ultimate peace where there is now war, a faith in ultimate human satisfaction where there is now need and poverty, a faith in brotherhood of interest and workmanship where there is now distrust, waste, and futility? We believe so.</page></plain_text>
