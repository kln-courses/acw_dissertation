<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELENA QUIROGA'S YO VOICE AND THE SCHISM BETWEEN REALITY AND ILLUSION MARTHA ALFORD MARKS Northwestern University Elena Quiroga stands in a variety of positions in relation to the characters in her works.1 In many novels she steps back completely and allows the "implied author"2 to assume control of the narrative, often taking advantage of his omniscience to peer at random into the minds of several characters in order to relate the story from a variety of perspectives. Yet Quiroga's most poignant protagonists are undoubtedly those who speak directly in the first person. These dramatized narrators lend an extremely personal tone to the novels in which they appear and emphasize the semi-autobiographical nature of much of Quiroga's writing. More importantly, they build a foundation for the ironical undertones which abound in her works and are inseparably interwoven with the presentation of one of her major themes: The schism between reality and illusion. Reality and illusion is a key theme in Quiroga's writing, for over half of her works deal with the false front of deception which human beings use to shield the truth from others and even from themselves. Words such as careta, enga?o, decepci?n, mentira, falso, fingir, parecer, and disimular appear with remark able frequency in her novels. It is in her first-person works, however, that we find Quiroga's most consistent and provoca tive presentation of the theme. This essay will investigate the nature of Quiroga's yo voice, with an eye to deciphering the manner in which the novelist propels her narrator/protagonist into an often ironical quest for truth against the barriers of self-deception and hypocrisy which abound in her fictional world. 39</page><page sequence="2">40 ANEC, 5 (1980) Since the early perspective experiments of James, Conrad, and Faulkner, literary theorists have suggested a number of ways of looking at the first-person novel. Bertil Romberg de scribes several traditional categories, including the epic, the memoir, the letter, and a combination of these forms.3 Wayne Booth offers a series of concepts which proves to be helpful in underlining differences in perspective within first-person novels. He distinguishes between the observer-narrator and the narrator-agent, the reliable narrator and the unreliable one, and the self-conscious and the unself-conscious narrator.4 Scholes and Kellogg present other useful variations: The inward turning or outward-turning eyewitness narrator and the con cept of the histor.5 Since none of these terms truly overlaps or excludes the others, all will be considered in this discussion of Elena Quiroga's five first-person works: La sangre, La enferma, Pl?cida, la joven, Tristura, and Escribo tu nombre. As defined by Romberg, the epic novel is one in which a "narrator presents a story orally to a listening public."6 This clearly describes La sangre, for here a chestnut tree serves as the means through which the reader learns of the activities of five generations of humans living on a Galician pazo. As for the motivation for the casta?o's long soliloquy, the aged narrator is stirring his memory to entertain and instruct the younger trees, who know nothing of what happened in earlier years. In a leisurely fashion reminiscent of countless human narrators in real life and in fiction, this unlikely storyteller begins his tale: "Recuerdo, hace muchas lunas, cuando yo era un ?rbol mozo y engre?do" (p. 7). The casta?o's random recollections, infused throughout the chronological story, occasion the fluid nature of this novel, where today's events evoke memories of yesterday and speculations about tomorrow. A rigid unity of perspective is maintained throughout La sangre. Nothing is known but those incidents which the casta?o has seen or heard personally during his long life outside the Castelo. The time of the novel is thus limited to the life span of the narrator. His awareness of the human world surrounding him came only after he had lived for several years. Had this awareness come to him earlier, the narrative would have in cluded the ancestors of the novel's protagonists. As this was not the case, no effort is made to inform the reader of events which took place prior to the casta?o's earliest memories. Likewise, the narrative stops abruptly when the tree is chopped down.</page><page sequence="3">MARKS 41 This extremely limited point of view might be considered a drawback, since the chestnut tree obviously does not know what happens in areas of the Castelo into which he cannot see. Only certain rooms lie directly in his line of vision. Of what takes place in the rest of the building he frankly admits he knows nothing. Nor is the narrator free to come and go with the human characters when they leave the immediate grounds. The novel never departs from this restricted viewpoint. The only facts which the reader knows are those which the tree also knows, and those events which fall beyond the narrator's abil ity to see, hear, or surmise are logically excluded from the story. Despite this drawback, the casta?o is an effective outward turning eyewitness, for his perspicacity and his willingness to comment on the situations which he has observed more than compensate for the disadvantages of his limited perception.7 Yet he must also be recognized as the most unreliable of Quiroga's first-person narrators. It is not that his insights are faulty or that he is deliberately lying, for exactly the opposite is true. His unreliability is due merely to the fact that he cannot understand the ramifications of every act which he witnesses and thus is somewhat naive in his judgment. Instead of being hampered by these limitations, however, Quiroga puts them to good use to create a work rife with ironi cal undertones. In one basic respect, the author, the human characters, and the reader share information which is withheld from the narrator by virtue of his ignorance of human customs. Although the tree possesses remarkable sensitivity and insight into human affairs, there are times when the reader must draw his own conclusions as to what has happened, for the narrator is unable to comprehend the meaning of what he is reporting. Usually this is not difficult. When, for example, the bewildered casta?o states, "La puerta se cerr?. Y nada m?s supe ni nada m?s vi, aunque a las pocas horas o? el ruido de aserrar madera y el de martillazos" (p. 260), the reader assumes that one character has died and that another is making a coffin for him. A more subtle irony is the reader's growing awareness that the casta?o is probably more sensitive and caring in his love and in his attitude toward life in general than are the humans who inhabit the Castelo. He perceives more acutely, suffers more intensely, and loves more deeply than most of them. His love of the sea, parasitic ivy, and a nearby tower forms a deli cate, humorous leitmotif that contrasts with the violence with</page><page sequence="4">42 ANEC, 5 (1980) which the human protagonists seek to achieve and maintain dominance over each other. We are given, of course, only the casta?o's own interpretation of such feelings, yet the reader comes away convinced that they are sincere and that they reflect a fundamental difference between the anthropomorphic nar rator and the people whose story he is telling. A third ironical aspect of La sangre has to do with the very nature of the narrative itself. The casta?o is obviously unable to communicate directly with the human protagonists in this novel. He often refers to the fact that the language of men is different from the sounds with which, he says, trees communi cate. This leads occasionally to a situation in which the narrator would like to clarify an untruth or advise a character of danger but finds himself powerless to do so. At the moment when he realizes that Dolores is slowly poisoning her servant, his frus tration is clear: "Sent? fr?o hasta la ra?z. . . Y tuve v?rtigo en mis ramas. . . La voz subi? en m?. ?No poder gritar!No poder decir a aquel ser humano que aquella palabra tra?a un hondo significado de muerte" (p. 279). The narrator and the reader stand together at this moment, powerless to communicate the terrible information which they share. The dramatic irony inhe rent in such a situation would exist for the reader whether or not the narrator shared it, but the mutuality of their feelings of helplessness compounds that irony and perfects it. It is, in fact, this very powerlessness on the part of the nar rator to express what he knows to be true that Quiroga utilizes to develop her theme of the elusive nature of truth. The casta?o is by far her most forthright commentator on the tendency of human beings to hide behind a protective web of lies and half-truths. Acutely aware of the falsehoods with which men live out their lives, but unable to express himself in their lan guage and thus correct them directly, he intersperses through out his narration such comments as: "Se enga?aban unos a otros soslayando las situaciones reales con falsas palabras" (p. 21), and "As? van, enga??ndose y enga?ando, corriendo por sus vidas, sin pararse un momento para desentra?ar la verdad de los otros. A ninguno parece importarle m?s verdad que la suya, y a la suya ajustan cuantas las rodean" (p.129). The cas ta?o points out repeatedly this tendency of man to believe only what he wishes to believe, even though such behavior may lead him still further into self-deception. Furthermore, the narrator comprehends that the words of men do not necessarily serve to express their true feelings or what they know to be truth:</page><page sequence="5">MARKS 43 "Nosotros tenemos el sonido que Jehov? nos dio para expresar nos y holgamos, pero los hombres lo tienen para disimularse" (p. 13), "Supe que iba a disfrazar la verdad con palabras, porque su voz se hac?a felina" (p. 149), and "Deb?a de decir la verdad, al fin, pero sonaba lo mismo que la mentira" (p. 244). With all the drawbacks inherent in the casta?o's limited perception, Quiroga's use of this non-human narrator is sur prisingly effective. Despite the fact that the casta?o does not participate actively in the events he describes,8 cannot know everything that happens to the people he observes, and cannot be completely objective about what he sees, his naive-astute asides to his listeners?and to the reader?enhance the novel's theme in a way that would have been lost had a human charac ter been allowed to employ his greater sophistication in telling the story. By virtue of his exclusion from direct interaction with the human protagonists of La sangre, the casta?o becomes an ideal critic of the human tendency to deal deceptively with his fellows and even with himself. This 1952 novel is Quiroga's first presentation of a thematic thread which comes to dominate her subsequent works. Tristura and Escribo tu nombre are Quiroga's contributions to the memoir novel, which "seeks to reproduce a whole life expe rienced in recollection, and which begins as far back as the memory can reach?and, if possible, still earlier."9 Tristura spans a period of two years, during which Tadea lives with her grandmother, and it also encompasses the gray areas of her earliest memories of life with her father. Escribo tu nombre picks up where Tristura ends and carries the heroine through the next six years of her life in a convent school. These two works form part of an incomplete trilogy of au tobiographical novels10 which is loosely based on Quiroga's own childhood experiences. Phyllis Boring has pointed out the numerous parallels which can be drawn between the lives of Quiroga and her young heroine, Tadea.11 Although these are very interesting, the question of "real-life" autobiography or fiction hardly matters when discussing works of such insight and universal appeal. Tadea could be any child growing up under circumstances which trouble her. Her growing conflict with the restraints imposed on her by adult authorities and her own budding sense of right and wrong, honesty and hypocrisy, are at the heart of her story.12</page><page sequence="6">44 ANEC, 5 (1980) Neither of these novels is presented as the work of Tadea as a girl. Rather, the woman Tadea is remembering the events, both trivial and crucial, which shaped her life and personality. This proves to be a strategic narrative position, one which es tablishes the ironic/thematic impact of these works. Here, as in La sangre, Quiroga has created an ironic situation, although one of an entirely different nature. Referring to the irony inherent in autobiography, whether real or fictitious, Scholes and Kellogg explain: "But to the extent that the narrating character is differ entiated from the author one ironic gap opens up, and to the extent that the narrating character is differentiated from himself as participant in events another ironic gap appears."13 In Tris tura and Escribo tu nombre there is no ironic gap between the narrator and the author, because both are mature women view ing the distant events from the same perspective. In this re spect, the strong factual parallels which Boring describes are significant. Both Quiroga and the woman Tadea comprehend the reasons why the child Tadea acts as she acts, just as both understand the historical and social factors which influence the child's life. It is only in the relationship between the mature narrator and the immature girl she was at the time of the events being remembered that irony enters into the novels. The older Tadea is plainly aware of the innocence and naivete of the child Tadea. The reader realizes this, too. Knowing that the mature narrator is conscious of her own childishness as protagonist frees the reader to judge Tadea from a similar perspective. This "secret communion" ** of adults reminiscing about childhood builds a bond between the narrator and the reader which adds a new dimension to the reader's perception of events as they occur in the novels. This secret communion also facilitates an unusual treatment of the theme of reality and illusion. Early in Tristura, Tadea experiences emotional chaos as a result of the conflicting words and behavior of her elders, but she is too inexperienced to comprehend or analyze the problem. Like the casta?o, she is aware of human hypocrisy and, in her naivete, is confused by it: "Lo que importa es ser buena. No basta ser, hay que parecer. Lo que importa es ser buena. No basta ser. Parecer. Importa. Parecer" (Tristura, p. 101). As she grows, Tadea comes to see the adult world as one in which standards are juggled at will to suit the needs of the individual or the situation, a world in which truth is seldom found. She learns that a lie is often be</page><page sequence="7">MARKS 45 lieved when the truth would be doubted, and her life becomes a chain of evasions to avoid conflicts with her relatives and teachers. By the time she appears in Escribo tu nombre, hers has become a world of "peque?as mentiras, enormes verdades" (Escribo,p.484), and she seeks to find an escape from the web of hypocrisy in which she is trapped. Her confusion becomes a crisis when she realizes that respected adults have occasionally deceived her, even to the point of telling outright lies, and that she has hitherto gamely accepted their words as truth. Horrified at this discovery, she makes a resolution which marks a turning point in her emotional development: "Sab?a que no s?lo las casas tienen fachada, y que la vida trascurre detr?s de la fachada, en el interior; quer?a sacar a la luz ese interior: Saber" (Escribo, p. 427). At last, Tadea reaches a level of maturity which allows her to accept responsibility for her own behavior and to look critically at what she has been taught and what she has observed in others. At this point, the reader realizes that the little girl whose life has been traced through two novels is crossing the threshold into adulthood. Her emotional evolution has thus brought her into closer proximity to the reader and the narrator. The key to this maturation lies in her acceptance of the fact that her concept of truth has been shaped by the illusions of the adults around her. With this discovery, she feels herself set free from the hypocritical trap of her past and believes that she can now establish her own future reality based on her new sense of personal integrity. Yet here again, the reader and the narrator share an ironic awareness that the "truth" which Tadea believes she has dis covered at the conclusion of Escribo tu nombre will inevitably suffer from exposure to the demands of life in a harsh world. Her evolution is not yet complete, for we see her only on the brink of creating her own reality. What that reality will prove to be in time is not revealed. Tadea does not share this knowledge, for she retains her own idealistic certainty that absolute truth is hers for the taking. In this respect, there is still an enormous gap between the self-confident teenage protagonist on the one hand and the adult narrator and reader on the other. As youth gives way to maturity, so, too, goes one's certainty that he can find and recognize absolute truth. This gap lays the foundation for an intriguing, multifaceted thematic game which Quiroga plays here, using the pro</page><page sequence="8">46 ANEC, 5 (1980) tagonist, the narrator, and the reader as pawns. What each of these sees as "reality" in Tristura and Escribo tu nombre depends on that individual's position in the narrative hierarchy. ADULT Tadea-Narrator and the Reader -Adult's idealized view of childhood -Adult's recognition that the child's view of adult hypocrisy and deception (as presented by Tadea-Protagonista) is essentially true, albeit one-sided Adult's pragmatic view of necessities of life in a difficult world CHILD Tadea-Protagonist Child's critical view of adult hypocrisy and deception As the diagram shows, Tadea-Protagonist, the least-aware member of the trio, is conscious only of one point of view. She knows nothing of another, more pragmatic concept of reality, for her judgment is based solely on her own limited experience. Reality is neat and precise for her. Tadea-Narrator and the reader enjoy a different vantage point, from which their heightened awareness allows them a glimpse of multiple levels of reality: The child's world as remembered from personal expe rience, quite possibly idealized by time and memory; the child's critical interpretation of adult behavior, as reflected in Tadea's story, an interpretation which the adult may also re member from his own childhood; and the adult's understand ing of the probable reasons for much of the behavior which Tadea finds so repulsive in her elders. These three separate viewpoints overlap at times, as the narrator and the reader ex perience a rush of sensations, each a reflection of a genuine feeling or attitude remembered from childhood or maturity. Each of these is a perfectly valid viewpoint, yet in the very validity of the conflict between them, Quiroga illustrates her theme of the necessarily elusive nature of "reality."</page><page sequence="9">MARKS 47 Unlike Tristura and Escribo tu nombre, Pl?cida, la joven and La enferma are totally unrelated works, yet structurally and psychologically they share a number of important traits. Both are told from the perspective of an unnamed woman narrator, the histor of Scholes and Kellogg. Traditionally, "the histor as narrator is not a recorder or recounter but an investigator"15 into the truth behind an apparent set of "facts." The narrator investigator in each of these novels has traveled from Madrid to Galicia for a vacation. In the remote village where she stays, each woman encounters a situation which piques her interest and causes her to probe her mind and those of the villagers with whom she talks for answers to the questions which trouble her.16 Both are isolated in a double sense: Neither woman has a friend or a friendly omniscient narrator to intervene or support her conclusions. Although neither is an eyewitness to the events that she relates, both are thoroughly reliable as nar rators. Their judgments appear to be unbiased and trustworthy, and "so long as what the character thinks and feels can be taken directly as a reliable clue about the circumstances he faces, the reader can experience those circumstances with him even more strongly because of his moral isolation." 17 This is clearly at the heart of the similarities in tone and substance between these works. Although the two novels diverge in other aspects, the underlying foundation of each is the relationship of the histor to the stranger whose tragedy she uncovers, as well as her own quest for the meaning of that tragedy. There is no better example of the dramatized, self-conscious observer in Quiroga's novels than the narrator of Pl?cida, la joven. By self-conscious, I accept Booth's definition of one who is aware that he is composing a work for someone else to read.18 This novel is presented as a fragment of a letter from the nar rator to her husband describing what she has seen in the coastal village in Galicia. In addition to her own observations, the tes timony of several villagers is important for the development of the narrative, although this information is not given directly, as in La enferma. The narrator here merely repeats to her husband the facts which she has gathered about Pl?cida's life and death and her own intuitive feelings about the dead woman. The direct addresses which the narrator makes to her hus band are infrequent and not obtrusive. "Aun hoy, mientras te escribo. . . " (p. 11), she writes in the first paragraph, which begins in mid-sentence, indicating that irrelevant material has been eliminated by an editor. Periodically, the reader is re</page><page sequence="10">48 ANEC, 5 (1980) minded subtly that he is not reading a work of fiction but a J/rea[" event experienced by the narrator and subsequently re layed to her husband: "Estaba escribi?ndote esta carta? ?cu?nto tiempo llevo escribi?ndote? La dej? ayer hacia la mitad y he continuado ahora cuando el sol va alto" (p. 55), and "Creo que en el fondo he continuado esta carta ?nicamente para de c?rtelo" (p. 58). There are several levels of narration in Pl?cida, la joven, and the relationships between them can be described graphically: IMPLIED AUTHOR NARRATOR. VILLAGERS EDITOR. .HUSBAND (letter) (novel) READER Of these individuals, only the existence of the narrator and her husband is essential to the letter which forms the substance of the novel, for without one or the other there would be no letter. The contribution of information by the villagers is interesting, but it is not essential either to the letter or to the novel. The involvement of the editor, a necessary ingredient for the ulti mate form of the letter as it reaches the reader, may be surmised by the elimination of the first part of the letter. There remain only the implied author and the reader, both of whom exist solely in relation to the letter as a work of ficton. They are outside the existence of the letter as "fact." The presence of the implied author, the narrator, and the editor is necessary for the details of Pl?cida's tragedy to reach the reader. The husband lies outside the trajectory of essential involvement in the novel, except as he provides the reason for the letter's being written in the first place. Camouflaged in this complex of narrative levels runs the same thematic thread that we have already seen in La sangre, Tristura, and Escribo tu nombre. The reader's certainty that he can recognize what is reality and what is fiction is subtly chal lenged by the buildup of slightly dizzying questions: What is real here? Is this truly a novel, or did it actually begin as a letter?</page><page sequence="11">MARKS 49 If a letter, how has it come to the attention of the editor? Is the narrator Quiroga herself or merely a woman who resembles her? Is it possible that we are eavesdropping on a personal confession which we have no business hearing? Gradually, the reader may come to wonder about the very premise on which this short work is based, for an epistolary novel contains within itself the potential to transport its reader beyond the limits of "fiction" and into an obscure land of possibility and ver isimilitude. In this respect, it is the reader who is left out of the "secret communion" shared here by the author, the narrator, and the editor. The ironical joke is on us now, and no amount of sophisticated reasoning can shake the uncomfortable feeling that we may be the victims of the author's clever manipulation of our underlying insecurity as to what is "really" reality. Another intriguing aspect of Pl?cida, la joven is the way in which Quiroga emphasizes the narrator's personal quest for understanding of the meaning of Pl?cida's lonely life and death, thereby forcing herself to de-emphasize the story of the title character. Certainly, it is not the untimely end of a young peas ant woman which makes this work so appealing. Rather, the pathos lies in the narrator's remorseful confession of her own failure to fulfill her obligations to another human being suffer ing under conditions which she herself can only vaguely im agine. It is the narrator's struggle, not Pl?cida's, which is at the heart of this novel. Quiroga recognizes this, and her willing ness to subordinate the details of Pl?cida's pitiful life to the narrator's anxious battle with her own conscience raises Pl?cida, la joven from the shallows of melodrama to the level of excel lence in modern psychoanalytical fiction. In La enferma, Quiroga blends the memoir novel with vari ous monologues reminiscent of the epic novel to create the most varied of her first-person works. Like Pl?cida, la joven, it is told from the perspective of an unnamed forastera. Unlike Pl?cida, the narrator here is totally unself-conscious; she is not aware that her words will be read by others. There is no overt state ment in La enferma as to the purpose of her telling this story, nor is any indication given as to her intended audience. No t? or usted is ever used by the narrator, except as she speaks to the other characters in the novel. Thematic and perspective considerations are even more closely linked here than in Quiroga's other first-person works, for in La enferma very little of what is said by the various speak ers can be accepted without question. Everything is shaded</page><page sequence="12">50 ANEC, 5 (1980) with doubt, and neither the narrator, the other characters, nor the reader can ascertain what is real and what is not. Truth in this novel is intangible, difficult to grasp and to accept. Early in the work the narrator describes the fuzziness of a portrait which she sees and concludes that "alguien?dibujante o modelo? hab?a temido la implacable verdad" (p. 41). This line neatly encapsulates the problems found in La enferma and sets the tone for the entire novel. La enferma is divided into three distinct parts. The first consists of the narrator's personal observations about her trip to Galicia, flashbacks to the distant past and to moments im mediately preceding the novel's chronological beginning, con versations with the villagers, and occasional direct quotations from them, carefully set apart by such phrases as "dice Alida que le contaron" (p. 68). This first section is unilateral, the narrator's own perspective, and there is no deviation from her experiences, her conversations, and her thoughts. The second part is totally different, both in tone and in structure. It is subdivided into a series of six independent monologues by don Sim?n Pedro, the village priest; Lucia, a teenage girl; Alida, a middle-aged nurse; D?maso, Alida's hus band; Justa, the telephone operator; and Angustias, an embit tered, alienated woman. Each of them speaks iirectly in the first person. No quotation marks are used here, as in the first section, when a villager speaks directly, and neither the implied author nor the narrator injects a voice into these sections. They are clearly not dialogues, since the forastera never participates except as silent listener, whom the townspeople address as usted. Yet she is plainly there as they speak, listening impas sively as each villager tries to persuade her to see the "truth" as that individual sees it. These highly personal statements are expressed with conviction and emotion, and through them both the reader and the narrator come to know all the "facts" relating to the village tragedy, even as we begin to doubt our ability to recognize the truth when we hear it. Each speaker in this second section has his own distinct manner and motive for talking with the narrator, and each monologue carries the thematic schism a step further. Don Sim?n Pedro, the priest, presents the first monologue, an un biased account of the happenings of twenty years before. He offers a simple tale of two childhood sweethearts, Telmo and Liberata. Don Sim?n recounts Liberata's increasing jealousy and possessiveness toward her friend and the need which</page><page sequence="13">MARKS 51 Telmo felt to loosen himself from her. From the priest the nar rator first learns of Telmo's sudden marriage to another girl and of Liberata's emotional breakdown when she heard of it. The entire story appears simple: Pathetic and tragic, certainly, but altogether lacking in mystery. Don Simon's monologue gives the reader his first concept of "reality" concerning the facts of the story. Only in later monologues does the narrator?and the reader?come to suspect that the first impression received from the priest might have been mistaken. The suggestion is not that don Sim?n deliberately lies, but that he may not know all the facts and thus may not be as reliable as the narrator and the reader first consider him to be. There are subtle discrepancies which emerge as the novel progresses. One of these has to do with the true nature of the principal character. As might be expected in a small village which has been torn apart and polarized by a rift between members of its most prominent families, it is difficult to find agreement among the townspeople about the primary figures in the tragedy: Telmo, his sister Angustias, Liberata, and her nurse Alida. Telmo is variously described as sincere in his love for Liberata and as deceitful in his treatment of her; as the main cause of her madness and as the victim of her scheming; as a successful, wealthy poet living luxuriously in Buenos Aires and as an im poverished failure haunted by bitter memories and guilt. The ironically-named Liberata is the most important figure in La enferma, although she has not spoken for twenty years, and she is the subject of as much discussion and as many varying opin ions as is Telmo. Some of the villagers relate that she was highly esteemed in town from early childhood, attracting the praise and affection of all. Others insist that nobody had much sym pathy for her until after Telmo's marriage. Contrary to the opinion of some that she was willful and headstrong, Alida remembers Liberata as a timid, self-deprecating young girl. Angustias disagrees strongly with Alida, saying that Liberata was haughty and jealous and that she sought to deprive Telmo of his right to live his own life, Alida and don Sim?n agree that Liberata's madness had its origin in her shock upon discovering that Telmo had married another girl. According to them, Liberata's reaction was so se vere that she tried to strangle her mother and had to be tied to her bed. Upon returning home from a mental hospital, she went to bed, turned her face to the wall, and never rose or spoke again. Angustias has another interpretation of these events:</page><page sequence="14">52 ANEC, 5 (1980) That Liberata's original "madness" and her subsequent with drawal from life were deliberate attempts to win Telmo back or destroy him. Although Angustias is the only speaker to declare openly that Liberata's madness is of her own making, others insinuate that the girl may never have gone mad or that she may actually have been mad all along. Thus the most basic "fact" upon which La enferma is based, that Liberata passed from san ity into madness upon losing her lover, is questionable. This second part of La enferma offers a devastating assort ment of contradictory testimonies, and the reader and the nar rator are faced with the perplexing problem of deciding which of the possibilities contains the truth, if, indeed, the truth can be found in any one of them. It is not easy to solve, as the narrator states: "Comprend?a perfectamente a Alida, y, des graciadamente, hab?a comprendido a Angustias" (p. 222). The reader is forced to look between the lines to form a judgment as to what is correct and what is not. No direct answer is ever provided, and the judgment as to what is "real" can be expected to vary from reader to reader. After the second section ends, the third part resumes the narrator's own first-person account of her last day in Galicia and her return flight home. The effect of the uncertainties which she has uncovered in this small town is so powerful that the narrator leaves with the feeling that her entire experience there has itself been an illusion. The very framework of La en ferma ?its introductory passages dealing with her journey to Galicia and its final pages recounting her flight home? reinforces this sensation of a parenthesis in the narrator's life. The mysteries of Liberata, Telmo, Angustias, and Alida fade as the stranger who has come to know them returns to her every day routine. At the end she appears uncertain as to whether the things she has heard and seen were real or not. Her faith in appearances is completely gone, and she finds that she has much less confidence in what she once would have called "real ity." Several critics have discussed this technique of offering a plurality of perspectives toward a single incident. Benito Valera J?come defines it as the "enfoque narrativo m?ltiple," a style of combining viewpoints which he believes springs from the ex periments of the cubists.19 Andr?s Amor?s points out the debt which novelists working with this method owe to the tech niques of the cinema: "Los ejemplos m?s claros de perspec tivismo nos vienen, quiz?, del campo cinematogr?fico: En</page><page sequence="15">MARKS 53 filmes como Rashom?n o The Outrage contemplamos las di ferentes versiones que de un mismo acontecimiento (gene ralmente undelito) nos ofrecen cada uno de los actores o espec tadores."20 Scholes and Kellogg point out a related effect of having a multiplicity of narrators: "It tends to place the primary narrator in the position of histor, seeking to find out the truth from the versions he is told."21 In La enferma, this technique is used to provide a composite, although conflicting, picture of the events which led the central figures to madness, exile, and death. Although the histor here can never resolve the questions which arise as others talk to her, the juxtaposition of viewpoints is necessary for the development of the novel's central theme: The impossibility of settling forever the question of what is real and what is illusion. There are a number of general observations which can be made regarding the narrators which Quiroga uses to tell her tales. Three of these first-person voices are so closely similar to her own as to appear semi-autobiographical, and these novels are, in fact, based to some degree on her own experiences. Only La sangre offers a dramatized narrator who could not be mista ken for Quiroga herself. There is no reason why this should be surprising, for "the narrator is often radically different from the implied author who creates him,"22 yet the preponderance of Quiroga-like women narrators makes the casta?o notable for his variance from the norm. Since a non-human narrator enjoys the greatest ability to comment dispassionately on man's habit of self-delusion, Quiroga's creativity is of great thematic advan tage in this novel. Of the four narrators discussed here, the casta?o and the two unnamed women of Pl?cida, la joven and La enferma are merely observers. They have no influence at all on the events they are relating. The casta?o is powerless because he is incapable of communicating or participating in the lives of the human pro tagonists. The two women are forced into the position of obser vers because their status as guests in the villages removes them from the daily life of the townspeople. In the case of La enferma, there is the additional burden of narrating a story which oc curred two decades before; obviously the narrator cannot con trol in any way the events of the past. Only Tadea of Tristura and Escribo tu nombre is a true narrator-agent, for she is able to "produce some measurable effect on the course of events."23 Ironically, this also makes her the most pathetic of Quiroga's first-person narrators. She is</page><page sequence="16">54 ANEC, 5 (1980) capable of exerting her will in small ways, yet her youth in hibits her potential to change her life in a measurable way. This proves to be a constant source of frustration to her throughout both volumes, and only at the end of Escribo tu nombre does she achieve enough personal power to begin to alter her life. Quiroga's dramatized narrators appear to be searching for various things. Some must fight feelings of guilt and inadequa cy; others battle hostility and bewilderment at what befalls them; still others seek only love. Yet there is an underlying quest which dominates the lives of all these y o voices: A desire to understand the meaning of their own existence and to ferret out the truth about the world around them. Reality in Quiroga's novels is never a constant, attainable thing, but the quest for truth is seen everywhere. Even in Pl?cida, la joven, where there is little overt attention paid to the theme, the novelist manages to tease the reader with the multiple planes of reality which she has built into this short work. In the other novels, it is the first-person narrator who offers most of the thematic insights. Nevertheless, throughout all five works, the give-and-take re lationship between the author, the narrator, and the reader heightens this sense of mutual quest for an elusive reality in a world of illusions.

The casta?o does, of course, play an important role as a focal point for the lives of the characters, as well as a living symbol of the family beside whose ancestral home he stands. By his very position as dramatized narrator, the casta?o attains the status of "character" and even that of the novel's protagonist, yet he remains incapable of influencing the events which take place around him. 9. Romberg, p. 39. 10. The final volume, Grandes soledades, has not yet been released. When I visited Quiroga in Madrid in June, 1978, she indicated that the novel was nearing completion but that she was uncertain when it would be published. 11.

Sin embargo, ella misma no es un personaje totalmente individualizado. . . es decir, no se trata de un personaje con un car?cter peculiar?simo que se impone por la fuerza de lo extraordinario.

Booth, p. 304. 15. Scholes and Kellogg, p. 242. 16. The similarities between these two novels are more than coincidental, for they are both based on Quiroga's own experiences. It was while preparing La sangre, sequestered in a private home on the Atlantic coast of Galicia, that she encountered a woman who, like Liberata in La enferma, had lain silently in bed for years. Pl?cida, la joven is based on a similar incident. During another visit to Galicia, Quiroga heard of the death of a peasant woman whom she had often seen passing on the street but with whom she had never spoken. The novelist's remorse at not having offered assistance or encouragement to this obviously suffering woman parallels the guilt expressed by the narrator. In fact, the reactions of both these narrators to the pathetic creatures whose tragedies they discover are, by her own admission, those of Quiroga herself under similar circumstances. This accounts in large part for the extremely personal tone which dominates these works. 17. Booth, p. 274. 18. Ibid., p. 155. 19.
