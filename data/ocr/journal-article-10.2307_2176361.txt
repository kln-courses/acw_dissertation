Rev, Ph., XXIV, 9, pp. 263-270. The aim of this study is not to show that there can be something new in the conclusion of a syllogism, but to show, in opposition to the English real- istic school, that the new conclusion may be accepted as scientific truth. For instance, the validity of the classic syllogism : Man is mortal, I am a man, therefore, I am mortal, is disputed. One should say, it is held. The men of past times are dead, I am a man, therefore, it is probable that I shall die. But, says Naville, the Aristotelian idea of essence has been replaced by that of law. We should now say, rather: If a being lives by means of food, it will die; I live by means of food; therefore I shall die. The Hfis transferred from the conclusion to the major premise, and if the law is accepted the conclusion is true, even to science. But the rules of scholastic logic can be assented to; what constitutes the logical value of the assumption or inclusion is substitution, of the exclusion is the impossibility of substitution. Modern logic, by founding reasoning upon substitution and non-substitution, has made apparent both the novelty and the scientific char- acter of its conclusions. G. BENEDICT. Positivisme et rationabime. L. WEBER. Rev. de Met., VII, 4, pp. 426- 445- The ' positivism' which is so widely diffused in modern times is distinct from the system of Comte. Ordinary positivism is not systematic, does not give any account of itself, is not conscious of itself. Comte's positivism is systematic, but positivism as a system destroys itself. In his conceptions of humanity and progress, Comte goes beyond positivistic affirmation. Hu- manity is an idea of reason, and if reason is always a source of error, it is not easy to see why an exception is made in the case of this particular product of reason. Comte's system is, in fact, of necessity partially rationalistic.</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 89 Rationalism, however, cannot stop with partial views, and therefore cannot accept Comte's final category as final. DAVID IRONS. Necessity and Limitations of Anthrof5omorj5hism. GEORGE A. COE. New World, VIII, 3I, PP. 447-460. The religious view of God has always been anthropomorphic. Science thinks it has entirely excluded this feature from its views. The fact is, however, that all thought, scientific as well as religious, has been, and must necessarily be anthropomorphic. To primitive man, nature was alive, and all his explanations were but references to the actions of spirits. Science has tried to explain by natural forces, and to reduce all things to a mechanism in which there is no need of a resort to soul. Yet, notwithstanding, the root notions of science have not been so successful in escaping anthropomorphism. Physicists are coming to recognize that science rests upon a psychological basis of sensa- tions and perceptions, and is so far anthropomorphic. Energy, law, and matter are the chief concepts of science. But what is energy? The power of doing work. But this is merely a set of sensations of motion whose only intelligible meaning is derived by generalizations and analogy from our own active functions. Similarly, the concept of matter is also a transfer of states from the self to a not-self. But what are the laws of nature ? Either unity in multiplicity or necessity. The former means only an observed uniformity in the succession of phenomena. Necessity is either logical or dynamic, the former of which we experience in ourselves, while the latter has no clear content except by analogy to the former. Hence all these concepts can be interpreted only in consciousness. Thus our knowledge of nature consists of a set of analogies drawn from human nature and life. This is not merely a passing stage, but a necessary aspect of science, for thought is the only revelation of reality. Even the notion of objectivity has its source in the logical judgment. All knowledge then has its basis in thought, and is necessarily anthropomorphic. Religion and science, then, can neither of them hope to get rid of anthro- pomorphism, but only of such forms as spring from vulgar conceptions of man. Our conceptions, not only of God, but also of nature, vary with our consciousness of self. Hence we cannot hope to reach a complete and final view of God or nature until we reach absolute consciousness; we can give to reality only such traits as are manifested in our experience; we must posit a real ideal for our immanent ideals of the true, the beautiful, and the good. A. W. CRAWFORD. Leib und Seele. LUDWIG BUSSE. Z. f. Ph., CXIV, I, pp. I-26. Psycho-physical parallelism takes its origin historically in the conflict between materialism and immaterialism. After the stage of occasionalism</page><page sequence="3">90 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. had been passed, three courses were possible: (I) to reduce body to mind; (2) to reduce mind to body; (3) to treat both as manifestations of a reality lying beyond them. The first two cannot be defended on philosophical grounds, the third asserts a unity, but offers no explanation as to its nature. Opposed to parallelism is the theory which posits interaction. Either view is compatible with several different metaphysical theories, and these may, therefore, be left out of account. Parallelism to be rendered consistent must be made thoroughgoing, and, when this has been done, it not only leads to highly paradoxical results but ultimately comes upon facts which it is quite unable to explain. Against interaction it is urged that it conflicts with the law of the conservation of energy. In order to remove this ob- jection, some have assumed that conscious processes simply represent one of the forms into which the energy of the universe may be transformed. This supposition, however, is tenable only on the assumption that qualita- tive differences must be recognized among the different forms of energy-a point upon which scientists are not agreed. There is in mind, furthermore, an element of spontaneity to which it fails to do justice. We must con- clude, therefore, that the law of the conservation of energy has been given too wide a range of application. The law is simply a generalization from observations made in a narrow sphere; its necessity cannot be demonstrated. It is of real importance only when limited to interaction among material things. Since mind plays a part in relatively few instances of interaction, the physicist encounters no serious obstacle in this limitation. BOYD BODE. Noch ein Wort zur Theorie des Parallelismus. FRIEDRICH PAULSEN. Z. f. Ph., CXV, I, pp. I-9. In this article the author mentions two points in which the theory of paral- lelism is superior to the theory of reciprocal action as developed in L. Busse' s article " Lieb und Seele " in a previous number of the Zeitschrift. The first lies in the direction of scientific thought, the second in that of philosophical thought as far as it is idealistic. Busse denies validity to the law of the conservation of energy because slight differences in stimuli often produce very great differences in their reactions. Were our knowledge of the brain-processes complete, this would probably be explained, but even as it is, the physiologist is entitled to retort: Explain with your means, what is inexplicable with mine. Here an equal difficulty will be experi- enced. The hypothesis of psycho-physical parallelism is the most appropriate conception, both for the physicist who is compelled to regard phenomena in causal relations, and for the philosopher who is seeking a formula for the universal connection of things, and especially for the connection between the physical and psychical worlds. HARRY L. TAYLOR.</page><page sequence="4">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 91 Die Realit/d der Zeit. HEINRICH BR6MSE. Z. f. Ph., CXIV, i, pp. 27-63. The author first discusses and rejects erroneous conceptions regarding the nature of time. Time cannot be considered a substance, for it lacks the element of permanence. Nor is it an independent process, for it would then presuppose another time. Nor yet is it related to things as their attri- bute, for it has reference only to their existence, not to their essence. Time must, therefore, be the form of events. Our psychical activity is indissolu- bly connected with time. The succession of psychical events, taken in connection with its content, is no less real than the events themselves, For the external world the reality of time can be asserted only mediately. That there is an external world in distinction from the self, appears especially in the difference between our psychical activity when creating synthesis, and when merely cognizing synthesis. If we refuse to ascribe to the world of objects the possibility of development, we create an intolerable dualism between the self and the world. Besides, we render it impossible to explain how a subject can also be an object for other subjects. The difficulty can not be avoided by denying the applicability of the laws of thought to things in themselves, for then there is no meaning in speaking of a world of objects at all. Development, therefore, must be granted, and with it time. An event can happen only in a real time, and conversely time is possible only in con- nection with events. The a priori element in the perception of time is the fact that in the laws, through which a state of consciousness becomes possi- ble, this perception is a function that necessarily realizes itself. In the Kantian arguments regarding time, the chief defect is the failure to dis- tinguish between time as perception, and time as a form of perception. BOYD BODE. Biology and Meta5lhysics. C. LLOYD MORGAN. Monist, IX, 4, pp. 538- 562. The sphere of science is the universe of phenomena. It is not the business of the scientist to learn why a thing exists. It is merely the ante- cedent which he seeks, not the underlying ground. The metaphysician, on the other hand, uses the results of science merely as means to an end. He does not care, qua metaphysician, what was the antecedent of any par- ticular phenomenon, but he does wish to know why one thing leads to an- other, or, more fundamentally still, why a thing is. Science is prone to say that it is impossible to get farther back than it goes. But it is not farther back that the metaphysician wishes to go-it is deeper down. Science is complete in its field, but it should not assume that its field is co-extensive with human enquiry. In fact, scientists themselves, while decrying the pos- sibility of a metaphysic, make use of it. The chemist and physicist are not content with tracing sequence and antecedence, but make use of ' chemical affinity,' i molecules,' ' atoms,' I force,'-all of them metaphysical concep-</page><page sequence="5">92 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. tions. These scientists have a very considerable quantity of data, and hence have a staging from which to soar off into speculation. The biologist has not progressed so far. Consequently, when he makes the assumption of vital force, he is immediately censured by chemist and physicist. But the biologist really has as good a right to postulate a vital force, superadded to the subtle chemical and physical changes in an animal organism, as the physicist and chemist have to say that it is not such an additional force which explains life, but more refined and inscrutable chemical and physical changes than any we meet with in inorganic nature. Both are using meta- physical conceptions. Science and metaphysics are supplementary. After all sequences are explained-after science has done its work-still the human mind will not be satisfied. It demands the reason of it all. Whether the reason be an underlying force of which phenomena are products or manifes- tations, or whatever the assumption, we are dealing with metaphysics. And the biologist has as good a right here as the physicist or the chemist. R. V. NYE. PSYCHOLOGICAL. Psychology and the Ego. C. LLOYD MORGAN. Monist, X, i, pp. 62-84. The author himself has summarized the argument of this article in the following words " Starting with the polarization of experience into its ob- jective and subjective aspects, we have attempted to indicate how each as- pect may be dealt with and interpreted through the ideal constructions of science in terms of antecedence and sequence; how the two aspects may be correlated; how force and will should be excluded from any rigidly scientific treatment save as measures of rapidity or intensity of phenomenal change; and how metaphysics may take up the task of trying to explain the universe and human life therein where science, as here limited, ceases to be applicable, endeavoring to frame a synthesis of its own on a different plane and with other canons of interpretation." LENA M. ALDRICH. beber den Begri/f der Gemiuksbewegung. C. STUMPF. Z. f. Ps. u. Phys. d. Sinn., XXI, I and 2, PP. 47-99. Professor Stumpf uses the expressions emotion' and 'affection' synony- mously. An affective state differs from a sensory Gefuihl in that it is based upon a judgment, while the latter is immediately evoked by a sensory im- pression. Desire implies an end that ' should be' attained, while an affective state (emotion) carries with it no such implication. The larger part of Professor Stumpf's article is devoted to a criticism of the current sensational theories of emotion which have grown up in opposition to this older view. An unfortunate scientific tendency to reduce the number of specific differences as far as possible has led many psychologists to identify emotions and 'feelings.' Thus Ribot's position is quite untenable even</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 93 with regard to such an affective state as fear. In this connection also, the James-Lange theory is considered in some detail. This latter conception, Pro- fessor Stumpf maintains, involves the validity of the following propositions: (i) if all the accompanying (organic and peripheral) phenomena of the emotions are eliminated, the emotions themselves will disappear; (2) if an emotion is induced solely by physiological conditions, the ideational ele- ments do not need to enter into the problem. But (i) the pathological evi- dence which James adduces in support of the first proposition is inadequate, (a) because, in the cases cited, the total absence of affective elements was not demonstrated, and (b) because the pathological conditions were corre- lated, not only with a subdued intensity of the emotional tone, but also with a tendency to general intellectual disintegration. (2) Regarding the second proposition, Stumpf maintains that real affective states are introspectively shown to be induced by, and constantly related to, some one circumstance which is focal in consciousness. If concomitant physical expressions augment the emotional intensity, the fact may be rationally explained by the accepted laws of association. In general, the James-Lange theory stands or falls with the theory of dynamogenesis-itself not yet fully estab- lished. Even Fere' s plethysmograph tests, so strongly emphasized by James, are not at all conclusive. Finally, even admitting the possibility of ideo-motor reaction, it has not yet been shown that such reaction gives rise to new sensations which, singly or in toto, constitute the emotion. The sensualistic definition is logically untenable since it is inconvertible. It may be impossible to produce an affective state without the presence of organic sensations; all psychic life demands an organic basis. But this does not mean that the emotion is the organic sensation; if it were, it should coincide with this sensation in quality, duration, and intensity. But this introspection denies. Qualitatively similar affective states are not in- frequently correlated with qualitatively dissimilar physical changes. Again, the affective states may vary momentarily though the organic sensations persist. Often the organic sensations arise and vanish before the corre- lated affective state begins. The sensational theory requires a contem- poraneous course. Thus, both from the standpoint of fact, and from the standpoint of theory, the sensational conception is inadequate and unten- able, whereas the older view, which the author represents, can easily be adapted to the very conditions which the newer fails to meet.

The author of TonfisychoZogie gives in this article the record of some very careful introspection upon two important types of auditory phenomena. (i) For several years he heard in the right ear a tone which was constant in pitch but variable in intensity. Although this intensity could be</page><page sequence="7">94 THE PHJLOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. IX. varied at will and even given a considerable strength, it did not interfere seriously with normal hearing. The immediate cause of this tone is uncer- tain, but it is probably to be sought in the middle ear rather than in the labyrinth or the auditory centers. Besides this constant tone, Professor Stumpf also noticed 58o variable subjective tones, which ranged in pitch from c to a8. Most of these variable tones were found in that portion of the continuum which displays the greatest sensitivity to objective tones. Their I clang-color,' like that of the constant tone, was always pure and ex- tremely pleasant. Their intensity was at times so weak as to be barely noticeable, and at other times so strong as to make the tone evident even in the midst of considerable noise. Localization was never doubtful in tones above a'. The duration varied from one second to an hour. Where a constant tone appeared simultaneously with a variable, the judgment of its interval was very accurate, showing that the I interval-feel' is not de- pendent upon the presence of overtones. Though there was no trace of beats, dissonance was often prominent. The conditions which seemed to favor the appearance of such tones were anemia, catarrh, nervous strain and exhaustion, but their immediate cause is uncertain. (2) The author also gives a record of his own case of double hearing. Normally he hears i/i6 of a tone higher with his right ear, but after a serious attack of catarrh a difference of 3/4 of a tone was noticed. Though he offers no new theory as to the cause of either of these phenomena, Stumpf's detailed and careful introspections are important both factually and theoretically, and fill a long-felt want in the field of acoustics.

According to the hypothesis of Rabl-Rueckhard and Duval, the excita- tion of a ganglion-cell produces a prolongation of its neurodendrons, and by means of this prolongation the protoplasmic processes of cells which are contemporaneously excited approximate each other. If we may suppose that these connections, once made, are permanently retained, and that each cell may enter into numberless combinations, we have the basis of a possi- ble physiological explanation of memory. W. C. BAGLEY. La _feur el Ze mnbehanisme des emnotions. PAUL HARTENBURG. Rev. Ph., XXIV, 8, PP. II3-134. Fear is one of the most important of our primary emotions, and deserves attention both from psychology and from medicine. It is our initial mode of reaction, and in animals it is a means of defense; that is, there is a phys- iological reaction. Fear often degenerates into the pathological. The question of fear will lead up to a consideration of emotion. When fear was first studied, it was looked upon as a moral agent; but later (in the James-</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 95 Lange theory) it was held to be physiological. These dualistic relations Ribot would combine into one, making it merely the same event trans- lated into two languages. Emotion, the author says, is an interior move- ment, an organized manifestation of the affective life. Fear comprises four successive nervous phenomena: (I) cortical motor excitation; (2) bodily reaction; (3) sensitive centripetal excitation ; and (4) cortical re- ception of the sensitive excitation and epiphenomenon of consciousness. These points the writer discusses, bringing out especially the fact that cerebral activities precede motor reactions; a fact which the James-Lange theory does not deny, but which it leaves out of account. The James- Lange theory is psychologically right when it says emotions are expressed before they are felt. But organic variations are not the cause of the emo- tion, only the cause of the consciousness of the emotion. That is, an emotion is an internal movement which produces an internal sensation. F. M. WINGER. Sur ha memoire. E. CHARTIER. Rev. de Met., VII, 3. pp. 302-324. Part I of this article appeared in the January number of the Revue de MAfaj5hysique et de Morale. Part II is treated under the following heads: evocation, quantity, quality, relation, modality. Part III discusses the idea of time. (I) ' Evocation' is the act by which we become aware of a thought which has existed before, but of which we have not been conscious. An idea is preserved, not by being put aside and treasured as by a miser, but by being constantly used as a circulating medium, now appearing and now disappearing, but always in use. No idea can become explicit without having been previously implicit. (2) Quantity. Consciousness of parts is necessarily implied in consciousness of the whole, analysis being only a passage from the implicit to the explicit. From quantity M. Chartier draws the first, second, and third laws of I evocation': (a) the effort of thought, applied to the idea of a thing conceived as a totality, is certain to discover the ideas of the parts of that thing; (b) the effort of thought, applied to the idea of a thing in any way limited in magnitude, must discover there the idea of a magnitude which suppresses it and of which it is a part; (c) the effort of thought, applied to a thing conceived as a unity, necessarily dis- covers the ideas of other unities equal to it in magnitude. (3) Quality. The discussion of quality is summed up in the law: the effort of thought, applied to the idea of anything whatsoever, discovers the ideas of things which resemble the first, and of things which are contrasted with it. (4) Relation. Relation brings out also a three-fold law: the idea of quality 'evokes the idea of the being which possesses it; the idea of effect 'evokes the idea of cause and vice versa ; the idea of an event ' evokes' the idea of other events upon which it depends and which depend upon it. (5) Modality. Modality treats of the real and of the imaginary. Imagin- ary images are I evoked' in accordance with possible connections of position. Real images are I evoked' in accordance with their fixed con-</page><page sequence="9">96 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. IX. nections of position. Necessary ideas are 'evoked' in accordance with their order of rational dependence. The idea of tomb is ' evoked' by the idea of cradle. This is not the effect of association by contrast; the idea of tomb is in reality nothing new, but an integral part of the idea of cradle, because the idea of cradle implies the idea of a man who is born, who lives and who will die. (6) Time. Time is nothing but a manner of judging, a way of arranging "evoked images." The idea of the future comes before the idea of the past. Time is only a translation of our reflective preferen- ces. It is will which creates and which preserves time. It is by the dis- tinction between objective and real time that one can explain certain anomalies often cited. Time is not a form of existence but a form of thought. MARGARET E. SCHALLENBERGER. Du temints de croyance. Camille Bos. Rev. Ph., XXIV, 9, pp. 27I-275. The thesis is that the complex act of belief requires time for its realiza- tion. Wundt and others have proved that some time is necessary for the simple act of perception ; but there is no comparison between this time, almost instantaneous, and the time necessary for belief, which is often very long. We know that even different sensations require different times for their realization, and that preception does not immediately follow sensation. This is especially clear in the case of grief; for, as M. Ribot says, " pain comes gradually and results from a summation," The physiological may be called the first degree in the time of operation ; the time of summation or central transmission will be called the second; the total synthesis or time of belief may be called the third. Between comprehending and be- lieving there must be an act of will, and this acting as a sort of preventive against too great and sudden shocks to the nervous system, denotes a su- periority. The cause of the illusion that belief is immediate may be found in language. We say we have had such a loss, or such a grief, or such a joy, but we do not actually realize it until we begin to adjust all of our acts to the change. The truth must incorporate itself with the rest of our exist- ence, must penetrate into our lives by a gradual process, and only then have we true belief. F. M. WINGER. The Sj5a/ia? Harmony of Touch and Szght. G. M. STRATTON. Mind, No. 32, PP. 492-505. In an effort to find whether touch and sight would come into har- mony, as far as spatial reference is concerned, Dr. Stratton arranged mirrors over his head and before his eyes, so ,as to make the image of his body and the immediate surroundings appear projected horizontally in front of his face-the top of the head about two feet away, and the rest of the body farther on in the distance. By screens he cut off all direct vision of himself and surroundings. He submitted himself to these conditions</page><page sequence="10">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 97 for a part of each of three successive days-twenty-four hours in all. Concerning objects external to the body, at first the chief difficulty was not that movements were started in the wrong direction, but that there was an instinctive feeling that things really within reach were hopelessly dis- tant. But sight soon overcame the difficulty, and conquered touch to such an extent that things seemed tactually perceived, where they appeared visually. However, with reference to the body itself, this harmony was not gained so soon. The projection in front was for some time thought of as a displaced image of the real body. But with the passage of time the nor- mal representation lost its vividness and persistency, and the new one gained correspondingly; by the third day the latter was frequently ac- knowledged as the real body. Thus, says Dr. Stratton, the experiment suggests that "in the end we would feel a thing to be wherever we con- stantly saw it." Touch would put itself in harmony with sight, and if our bodies appeared ten feet away from us we should think of ourselves as be- ing outside of them and looking upon them, and yet as having our feelings in them. The explanation is that " a correspondence, point by point, be- tween touch and sight, is built up associationally. R. V. NYE. ETHICAL. Lafinalith dans l'ordre moral.: etude sur la thlkologze dans l'kthique et la politique d'Aristote et de Saint Thomas d'Acquin. N. KAUFMANN. Rev. Neo-Schol., VI, 3, pp. 280-299. This study is divided into two parts. In the first, the author undertakes to show that the notion of the rational nature of man is of fundamental importance in Aristotelian ethics and politics; since (a) the perfection of the rational nature of man is the immanent end of moral activity, (b) this nature is the rule and law of moral activity, and (c) is based on virtue-the principle of finality, since it tends toward its own perfection as its end. Three degrees of perfection in human nature, also, and three natural in- clinations are to be distinguished: (i) by right of his own nature the indi- vidual man possesses in himself a fundamental perfection which, through that nature, he loves; (2) the isolated man cannot fully realize the per- fection his nature requires, but must be completed by human society, more especially by the State; (3) the supreme good pursued by man, how- ever, is beatitude in his union with God. The system of Aristotle-left incomplete by its founder, who brought out the finality of nature but did not answer the question whence came her tendency toward an end, his source of law being found in the State-is completed by Saint Thomas Aquinas through the conception of a natural law, given by God the Creator and part of the eternal law. The question as to the different particular ends pursued by the moral activity is reserved for another article. G. BENEDICT.</page><page sequence="11">98 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. IX. The -Relation of Ethics to Sociology. H. SIDGWICK. Int. J. E., X, X, pp. 1-21I. At the outset, the writer proposes to examine the claim of sociology to dominate the older subject of ethics, and even to reduce it to a department of itself. After briefly sketching the aims and methods of the young sci- ence, he begins the discussion by assuming that sociology has become an established science. If we suppose this, we must also suppose its forecast of social consequences to exercise an important effect on the practical ap- plication of general ethical principles. Indeed, some effect of this kind has already been produced on current ethical notions by the branch of sociology known as political economy. But the more important and more disputa- ble element of the claim promises not merely to modify the practical ap- plication of ethical principles, but to determine these very principles themselves. Our author admits that the connection of sociology with the subject-matter of ethics must be so intimate that its claim to dominate and subordinate this science shall be natural, and, yet, he maintains that this claim is due to a confusion of popular thought. For it is impossible to suppose a conflict so long as both ethics and sociology keep within their own domains. The former is concerned only with what ought to be, while the latter, even when it deals with ethical judgments, is only con- cerned with what is, has been, and will be judged. Still, there is a possible coincidence between the two subjects in respect of general truths, so close as, if accepted, to justify the view that sociology is destined to absorb ethics. Two hypotheses will illustrate this: " Supposing a con- sensus of sociologists to declare that the preservation of the social organism is the one all-comprehensive end, and supposing a consensus of moralists to accept this sociological end as the ultimate good to the at- tainment of which all human action should be directed," then it would be broadly true to say that ethics was absorbed by sociology. But, as a matter of fact, neither of these hypotheses can be accepted as more than partially true. The conclusion is that, while our ethical and sociological thought should be brought into clear and consistent relation, the mutual influence and interpretation of ideas between the two studies should be carefully watched in order to avoid any source of confusion. LENA M. ALDRICH. HISTORICAL. beber Lotze's Begr7 der metaj5hysischen Einheit al/er Dzinge. W. LUTO- SLAWSKI. Z. f. Ph., CXIV, I, pp. 64-77. Lotze was led to his conception of the unity of things by the difficulty which the problem of interaction presented to his thought. Interaction between two independent beings seemed to him an inconceivable and con- tradictory notion. Hence, he argued, there can be no independent beings;</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 99 all things are immanent in, and parts of, one universal Being. But the diffi- culty in the notion of interaction is due to the fact that Lotze insists on thinking the matter in terms of space-images-and this even though he follows Kant in maintaining the subjectivity of space. Passages from the Meta1hhysik are cited in proof of this point. The difficulty disappears for the most part when we discard such spatial imagery. The source of our concept of action and interaction must be sought in the consciousness of our own activity, and this carries the problem over to the realm of spirit and involves no necessary reference to space. The writer discusses at some length the views of Maine de Biran, who found in self-consciousness the source of the concepts of being and of substance. When we find the source of our concept of interaction in experience of our own activity, the nature of interaction is no longer unintelligible. The writer discusses briefly the four possible forms of interaction. If we let a, b, c, represent a series of self-conscious beings, and a, P, y, represent a series of unconscious beings, commonly called 'things,' then four forms of interaction are possible, which may be represented thus : a :1b; a : A ; a a : P. Of these the first is the typical form. In the light of all that precedes, the Mof the Meta- physik, Lotze's universal Being, is seen to be an unnecessary assumption. In place of Lotze' s explanation of all actioR as action within the one sub- stance Minvolving a denial of individual beings, we must suppose a world of spiritual beings having a similarity (Q4hnlichkeit), which is a primary fact or principle, and the reason for which we can not investigate. This makes interaction not only possible, but readily conceivable, since the inter-coin- munication between self-conscious beings-of which we have direct experi- ence-is the type of all interaction. VIDA F. MooRtE. The Ethics of the Bhagabad Gita. BIPEN CH. PAL. New World, VIII, 31, PP- 52I-535- The Gita has perhaps had a greater influence than any other of the sa- cred books of the Hindus on the life and thought of the people. It tended to universalize the Hindu religion, to rid it of its forms and ceremonies, and to substitute love for law. It forms, with the earlier Vedas and Upanishads, three stages of development in Hindu theology. The Vedas represent the objective ceremonial stage; the Upanishads, somewhat neg- atively, the subjective, in which God is conceived as infinite subject ; and the Bhagabad-Gita the fulfilment of the protests and negations of the Upanishads in a higher synthesis. Like the Upanishads, whose object was to reveal Brahman, the one ideal author and ruler of the universe, the Gita also teaches Monism, the fundamental doctrine of the Hindu religion and transcendence, its most characteristic idea. The word ' Maya' plays an important part in the theology of the Hindus, like Logos in that of Christendom. It represents the thought and energy of God as revealed in the universe. The world is not a mere shadow, but</page><page sequence="13">JOG THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, a manifestation of God, who is both immanent and transcendent. God is present in all things which are not unlawful. Thus there are ethical dis- tinctions, although a consistent monism compels a reference of evil to God, But evil is only a lesser good, a following of a lower impulse in the presence of a higher, and as such is relative. God is not therefore responsible for good or evil, which are alike due to Maya, the creative energy of God, the process of evolution, that is, to nature. What then is the standard of right conduct ? It is found in each man's position in society as given by nature. Not conscience, but the customs of the caste in which Nature has placed him, determines his duty. But does this not destroy morality? No, for to live according to heredity and nature, not automatically, but intelligently, is the highest morality. To resist nature is to fail, while to follow nature is to be free, if one does it as a son of God, and not as a slave. Duty, however, was not final to the Gita; the end is spiritual. Our imperfections are due to our being subject to the sensuous. We must, therefore, master the senses and control the mind, and this can be done only by spiritualizing the sensuous and realizing God in all we see and hear. This spiritual climax, this ' God-vision' can be realized only through love, the love of God, which is the key to this high spiritual life, this living in God, which is the highest end of life. A. W.
