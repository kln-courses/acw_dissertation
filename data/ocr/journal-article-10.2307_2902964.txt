<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRIS WATERS Representations of Everyday Life: L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain IN LANDSCAPE FOR A GOOD WOMAN, Carolyn Steedman offers her readers the story of two lives, recounting her own childhood in South London in the 1950s and her mother's in a mill town in the north of England between the wars. More than mere autobiographical reminiscence, however, the book reflects on what historians have done and might do-with stories of ordinary lives. In so doing, it addresses a number of important themes, exploring the connection be- tween memory and desire and between the shifting practices of everyday life and the postwar politics of nostalgia. The 1950s and 1960s in Britain are especially fruitful years for the consideration of these themes. It was then that many of the so-called traditional working-class communities in which women like Steedman's mother were raised were bulldozed in the name of progress, disrupting stable pat- terns of social life and generating both a desire for the promises of the "newJerusa- lem" offered by postwar planners and new capacities for nostalgically remembering a vanishing world. This essay examines the desire to memorialize the working- class past that emerged in these years, the codification of the industrial North as a site for popular remembrance, and the role played in this process by the work of the foremost artist of northern industrial life, Lawrence Stephen Lowry (1887- 1976; fig. 1). There is a particularly moving scene in Landscape for a Good Woman in which Steedman recounts a visit she paid to her mother, two weeks before her mother's death. 'As I went out," she writes, "past the shrouded furniture in the front room ... I saw hanging over the mantelpiece a Lowry reproduction that hadn't been there on my last visit." Pondering this new acquisition, a print of one of Lowry's paintings of the industrial North, Steedman asks herself, "Why did she go out and buy that obvious representation of a landscape she wanted to escape, the figures moving noiselessly under the shadow of the mill?" Answering her own question, she quotesJohn Berger's analysis of the characters who stalk Lowry's world: "They know each other, recognise each other.... They are not, as is sometimes said, like lost souls in limbo; they are fellow travellers through a life which is impervious to most of their choices."' Steedman's mother might indeed have found in Lowry's REPRESENTATIONS 65 * Winter 1999 ?) THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 121</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1.

But does this adequately explain why she, and many thousands like her, purchased inexpensive reproductions of Lowry's indus- trial landscapes, consolidating his status as one of the most popular artists in post- war Britain? Relatively unknown outside his native Lancashire before the 1940s, Lowry now enjoys a central space in the national imaginary. His paintings have come to symbolize both "the North" and the traditional working-class community and its everyday life. They depict a world we have lost, although, as Philip Dodd reminds us, it is a world that has been rendered familiar by Lowry and frozen in the mold of a Lowry painting: "'The North,"' he writes, "is less a number of particular places with specific histories than a Lowryscape, a settled place with an agreed iconography."2 Since the 1950s, the representation of Britain's industrial heritage as a "Lowryscape" has become ubiquitous, and Lowry's paintings have come to adorn the covers of many works that explore that heritage.

The Uses of Literacy, has a Lowry on its cover, as does A Local Habitation, the first volume of Hoggart's autobiography, which is graced by Lowry's 1936 canvas, "The Doctor's Surgery." Trevor Lloyd's textbook on twentieth-century Britain is framed by a Lowry, as is John Benson's 1989 study, The Working Class in Britain, 1850- 1939. More recently, the cover of an issue of History Today devoted to Britain's industrial rise and decline includes Lowry's most famous work, "Coming from the Mill" (1930; fig. 2). Reproduced on numerous occasions since 1945, this particular painting accompanied a discussion in Britain's daily newspaper, the Guardian, of Manchester's bid for the 1996 Olympic Games, albeit with the factory in the back- ground replaced by an Olympic stadium. The article was entitled, "And will Olym- pia be builded here among the dark satanic mills?"3 Other examples abound; taken together they suggest that the circulation of a particular set of images of the indus- trial North has been extensive, shaping our very knowledge of the world they portray. Understanding the ways in which Lowry's paintings have come both to signify the North and to play a crucial role in fueling and giving shape to the nation's L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 123</page><page sequence="4">postwar nostalgia for its working-class past is a difficult task. Moreover, it is a task made all the more difficult by the enigmatic character of Lowry himself. It requires a brief history of Lowry's life and rise to fame, along with an analysis of the work undertaken by a number of art critics to establish that fame. However, because the critical response to Lowry can explain neither the popular appeal of his paintings nor the symbolic importance they have come to assume, understanding Lowry's significance also requires an elaboration of the entire Lowry industry in the broader context of an important period of social change in Britain. It demands, as Michel de Certeau puts it, that not only must we study the circulation of a given representa- tion (such as a Lowry print) in society but we must also "analyze its manipulation by users who are not its makers."4 A Life on the Margins L. S. Lowry was always what his admirers wanted him to be, orchestrat- ing a self for critical and popular consumption that rarely contradicted the stories told about the importance of his work. As one astute critic has noted, he manufac- tured a particular image of himself as a self-sustained artist, "selecting, inventing or refining an appropriate anecdote or statement of intent" and "politely agreeing with the theories which were advanced in the form of questions."' He was adept at manipulating his own image, just as others manipulated the images he painted. Lowry was born in 1887, the only son of Elizabeth and Robert Lowry. His mother was an accomplished pianist; his father was a clerk, fastidious and punctual, a man of regular habits. Financial troubles defeated their ambitions, and the couple, unable to maintain their pretenses to gentility in a modest house on the edge of Manchester's Victoria Park, moved to Pendlebury, an industrial suburb between Manchester and Bolton.6 In 1904 Lowry gained employment as a clerk and in 1910 joined the Pall Mall Property Company as a rent collector. His work took him to the poorer districts of the region, and he incorporated many of the scenes he visited in his subsequent canvases. Although he began to study art in his spare time, enrolling in the Salford School of Art in 1915, Lowry remained with the Pall Mall for forty-two years, a fact he concealed from those he feared would use his occupation to characterize him as a part-time, amateur painter. Put forward as a working-class artist, Lowry was a white-collar worker, a voyeur of working-class life who knew the local community but was not part of it.7 Familiar with, yet mostly excluded from, the world he painted, he usually positioned himself in his industrial scenes as an outsider looking in. By the 1 950s and 1 960s, as will be demonstrated, many of his admirers found themselves in a similar position; like Carolyn Steed- man's mother, they had been severed from those communities that were the subject of Lowry's canvases, and were now able to view them only from a distance. It was after joining the Pall Mall that Lowry was inspired to paint what he 124 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 3. The documentation of everyday life in the North. L. S. Lowry, An Accident, 1926. Oil, 36.3 X 61 cm. ? Manchester City Art Galleries. termed the "industrial scene an event on which his biographers have lavished much attention. At times he claimed a theatrical source for his inspiration: Stanley Houghton's Hindle Wakes, a work of social realism set against a backdrop of mill chimneys. He saw the play in 1912, later recalling that this was the first time he saw "beauty" in the industrial environment.8 At times Lowry told a different story, recounting an experience that followed missing the train from Pendlebury to Man- chester: "It would be about four o'clock and perhaps there was some peculiar condi- tion of the atmosphere.... But as I got up to the top of the steps I saw the Acme mill, a great square red block with little cottages running in rows right up to it- and suddenly I knew what I had to paint."9 Lowry made much of this story because his critics did, discovering the moment when one artist's revelation made industrial Britain a fit subject for Art. Lowry's discovery of "beauty in the smoke" of industrial Lancashire may have marked a seminal moment in his own life; it certainly assumed monumental pro- portions in the stories told about him by others. Nevertheless, most of those stories were circulated after Lowry had become famous and after widespread interest had already been generated in the built environment and social life he painted. During the early years of his career, by contrast, Lowry remained relatively unknown. Although he completed some of his most famous works in the 1920s, including 'An Accident" (1926; fig. 3), "Coming Out of School" (1927), and 'A Removal" (1928), L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 125</page><page sequence="6">and, although the Manchester Guardian heaped praise on his work throughout the decade, he failed to sell many paintings and did not enjoy a national reputation. In the 1930s, various towns in the Northwest began to acquire works by Lowry. The Salford Art Gallery collected them in earnest, a local newspaper claiming that they conveyed "with remarkable truthfulness of expression the everyday life which we are accustomed to seeing in the city."'1 Lowry's focus on the minutiae of the everyday was, as we shall see, responsible for much of his popular appeal in the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, his road to national celebrity only really began in 1939, after he had been "discovered" by Alex Reid, exhibited in a one-man show at the London gallery of Reid and Lefevre, praised by Eric Newton, art critic for the Sunday Times, and championed byJohn Rothenstein, director of the Tate Gal- lery from 1938 to 1964. Raised in Sheffield, Rothenstein, like many other northern- ers, did much to popularize Lowry in the metropole. He later recalled his first encounter with Lowry's work in 1939: "I stood in the gallery (Reid and Lefevre) marvelling at the accuracy of the mirror that this to me unknown painter had held up to the bleakness, the obsolete shabbiness, the grimy fogboundness of northern industrial England."11 In 1942 Lowry was approached by the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) "to undertake for the Ministry of Information a few paintings of Factory and Production subjects."'2 While the WAAC was disappointed by Lowry's work for them, the interest in the industrial North cultivated by organizations like the WAAC during the war was directly related to Lowry's popularity after the war. Despite the claims of those who "discovered" him, Lowry was only able to generate an extensive following once the world he painted had itself been discovered. The fascination with the ordinary, everyday life of the industrial North that had been evident in the work of Mass Observation, the organization established to observe and reflect on everyday life in Britain, and the documentary film movement in the 1930s, and that grew significantly during "the people's war," helped to fuel the popularity of Lowry's representations of that life. The war thus accelerated Lowry's rise to fame, and in 1945 he was awarded an honorary degree by Manchester University, where he was presented as an artist who "has set himself to put on canvas the essential truth about the Lancashire scene and Lancashire people" and whose work conferred "beauty on the seemingly unattractive. "13 By 1950 there were thirty-seven paintings by Lowry in public collections in Britain (and one in the Museum of Modern Art in New York), a figure that had tripled a decade later. 14 After thirty years of painting industrial scenes that generated little interest, Lowry was suddenly a celebrity. Despite the fact that by the 1950s the industrial world he portrayed was in decline, the demand for his studies of that world became incessant: "The blighters keep asking for more," he once complained. 15 Lowry obliged, com- pleting works all entitled "Industrial Landscape" in 1952, 1953, and 1955. In the 1960s and 1970s Lowry's fame continued unabated. Harold Wilson was a devoted fan, offering him a knighthood. In 1964, during his first term as Prime 126 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">Minister, Wilson chose "The Skaters" for his official Christmas card, selecting "The Pond" (1950) the following year; four years later, interviewed by David Frost for the BBC, Wilson was pictured at his desk with a Lowry on the wall behind him."6 In 1967 Lowry's "Coming Out of School" (1927) appeared on the highest denomination postage stamp in a series dedicated to "great British artists" (the others were Thomas Gainsborough,Joshua Reynolds, andJohn Constable), and in 1976, the year he died, Lowry was honored by a retrospective of his works at the Royal Academy that attracted a record 180,000 visitors. Twenty years after his death, his paintings continued to be in demand, the top auction price paid in the mid-1990s for a Lowry original reaching L152,000.17 Lowry and the Critics Art critics in Britain obviously contributed to Lowry's success, although it is not enough to suggest that he was simply "discovered" by the critics in 1939. This is the story told by Maurice Collis in The Discovery of L. S. Lowry (1951). As heroic as it is the story of unappreciated genius, of hidden talent found-it can neither account for Lowry's postwar popularity, outside the narrow realm of his critical admirers, nor explain how his works have come to symbolize the North, in the process becoming crucial tools in consolidating the postwar remembrance of the nation's industrial past. Nevertheless, the critical response to Lowry's work remains important. Not only is it extensive, but certain strands of it generated a particular image of the man and his work that can help explain why his canvases became central to the nostalgia for the working-class past that became ubiquitous after the war. By viewing his representations of the everyday life of the working class as a key moment in the evolution of the Englishness of English art, some critical interventions helped make Lowry available for those nostalgic appropria- tions of his work that were undertaken after the war. Given Lowry's own elusiveness, critics were able to tell several different stories about Lowry and his work. Between the 1930s and the 1960s, they offered three versions of the importance of that work; indeed, one might suggest that they in- vented three distinct Lowrys. First, there was the "political Lowry," committed artist of the dispossessed and their struggles for a more equitable order of things. Second, there was the "existential Lowry," lonely artist of the sad and solitary, adrift amidst the alien forces of modernity. Finally, there was the "English Lowry," inheritor of a great tradition of native art that repudiated continental influences. Each Lowry had his own agenda, but only the third contributed significantly to his widespread, postwar popularity. After the war, it was customary to think of Lowry as the artist who had discov- ered "beauty" amidst the grime of industrial Britain, who had made the North an object of aesthetic veneration. By no means "beautiful" when he started to paint L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 127</page><page sequence="8">it, the industrial landscape only came to acquire the attributes of beauty slowly. This makes it all the more striking that most of Lowry's early admirers praised him for depicting such an ugly world. Bernard Taylor, writing in 1921, suggested that Lowry "emphasises violently everything that industrialism has done to make ... Lancashire more forbidding than most other places."18 This sentiment was still common two decades later when another critic argued that Lowry's work offered "a grim commentary on industrialism" and served as a "reminder of what the popular conception of utilitarianism has done to England's 'green and pleasant land.' "19 The Left adopted this critical response as its own, the Daily Worker claim- ing as late as 1953 that Lowry made absolutely no concession to romanticizing the industrial landscape.20 Likewise, Howard Spring, born in the Cardiff slums in the 1 880s and a reporter for the Manchester Guardian in the early days of Lowry's career, praised him for depicting the effects of Britain's industrial revolution on the lives of ordinary people: "His pictures evoke for me the whole tragical sense of frustra- tion that the Industrial Revolution clamped upon the land."'21 For individuals like Spring, it was precisely the bleakness of the industrial land- scape, as captured by Lowry, that could fuel the call for change. In Fame is the Spur, Spring's wartime novel of the North, the main character, Hamer Shawcross, is a Labour MP and subsequent Cabinet member who was "particularly fond of an oil by L. S. Lowry" that depicted a steep, "unlovely street." Believing it was important to be reminded of the lives of those constituents he represented (as, no doubt, did Harold Wilson in the 1 960s), Shawcross made an explicit connection between aesthetics and politics in his veneration of Lowry.22 Francis Klingender, the marxist art critic, did likewise. He argued that Lowry was not "a romantic artist," looking "for picturesque views among the slums"; rather, he was an astute observer of the conditions of everyday life, an artist who charted the effects of material deprivation and, in so doing, helped inspire the struggle against the system responsible for them. Klingender claimed that many northerners disliked Lowry's works. But he also argued that "the time is not far distant when the people will face up squarely to their conditions and change them," in the process changing their minds about Lowry the one artist who was trying to open their eyes and make them think about the world in which they lived.23 Klingender was probably correct to assume that many workers disliked Lowry's paintings between the wars. Although we don't have too much evidence to confirm his assumptions, we do know that the workers who handled Lowry's canvases for his distributors certainly did not like them. BertJones, an apprentice framer, found them painfully reminiscent of his own, impoverished childhood, as did Fred Ball: 'A lot of us were poor and life was a struggle. Having been brought up to think of things in terms of beauty, I wanted something different in art I saw the sort of things that Lowry was painting every day at home . .. , outside our front door."24 Klingender was also correct in suggesting that many workers would change their minds about Lowry. But he was not correct in assuming that they would do so 128 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">when they faced up "squarely to their conditions" in order to change them. In fact, it was only after those conditions had been drastically altered by urban redevelop- ment and emerging forms of postwar affluence that Lowry would come to be widely appreciated and then shorn of any of the political messages that critics like Spring and Klingender were prone to read into his work. In the 1950s it was difficult to find the kind of radical readings of Lowry's work that had been prevalent earlier. Even Spring, writing in 1957, no longer seemed to view Lowry as apolitical, but rather as a romantic, artist. Lowry's paintings, he wrote at this later date, exhibit "the romance that is there when you open up the door any morning in an industrial town."25 This is not to suggest that earlier responses to Lowry's work disappeared entirely. In John Berger's appreciation of Lowry, for example cited by Carolyn Steedman in explaining her mother's purchase of a Lowry print such views still surfaced in the 1 960s. Like his predecessors on the Left, Berger continued to insist that Lowry's paintings made explicit a process of economic exploitation. His, however, was increasingly a voice in the wilderness, and he aptly noted that few critics discussed the "social or historical meaning" of Lowry's canvases.26 That his critics no longer seemed quite so interested in the "political Lowry" after the war was in part related to their invention of the "existen- tial Lowry" and the "English Lowry." The former was in large part the result of the work of Mervyn Levy, who developed the image of the artist as a lonely man, an image Lowry was eager to adopt, given his desire constantly to reinvent himself in order to please his critics. In shades of a 1950s Ingmar Bergman film, Levy suggested that Lowry has "the power to express the terrible isolation of the individ- ual soul, suspended irrevocably in the arctic loneliness that is the destiny of us all."27 Lowry's widespread postwar popularity owed little to this formulation of the artist's presumed existential angst. By contrast, it owed a great deal to those critical practices that rendered him a quintessential "English" artist. Many admirers championed his work as part of other projects, deploying his paintings in their own struggles against either formalist art criticism or continental influences on English painting. In the process, they deemed Lowry's work to be exemplary of certain British artistic traditions. Marxists like Klingender, for example, who advocated theories of realism in order to challenge the critical hegemony of Roger Fry's for- malism, praised painters like Lowry for advancing a native tradition of social real- ism.28 By contrast, critics like Levy, less interested in any political commitments to which artistic realism might give rise, also linked Lowry to a national aesthetic tradition. Levy argued that the "characteristically British vision of the native scene" was "irrevocably weakened by the stream of continental influences, many of them too exotic and sensuous for home consumption, that have played such havoc with British painters during the past fifty years."29 Such arguments were made again and again, especially in the 1 940s and 1 950s: Lowry's work was "untouched by the conventions of French impressionism"; "he is the first artist to create beauty from the English industrial scene, and he is the only major painter of our time who owes L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 129</page><page sequence="10">nothing to Continental influences."30 In the former decade the prevalence of such claims was related to the influence of the war on the need to define an "essential Englishness" on behalf of which citizens were asked to fight, in the latter to an entrenched resistance to international modernism. In 1943, Maurice Collis, art critic for Time and Tide, considered Lowry to be "essentially an English artist" who was transforming a "reality of back streets, ragamuffins, courtyards, football, tow- paths and tenements, into feeling and beauty." In 1951 he reiterated these points and praised Lowry for having represented "the dogged exertions of our factory people."'31 A decade later, Lowry's "essential Englishness" was commonplace:John Rothenstein, lamenting the fact that national characteristics were being under- mined by international developments in the art world, saw in Lowry a painter who remained "conspicuously English." Snrall wonder, then, that when the Robert Osbourne Gallery in New York mounted a show, "The Englishness of English Painting" (1964), Lowry's work enjoyed a prominent place.32 If for many critics Lowry came to occupy a space in the canon of English art, he did so in part because his work was linked to that of other English artists especiallyJohn Constable and to the artistic traditions they represented. In the 1930s, writers rediscovered Constable and his portrayal of the beauty of the "time- less" English landscape.33 Moreover, some of them compared Constable's affection for the countryside with Lowry's for the industrial landscape, Eric Newton writing in 1945 that "Lowry's Pendleton is as positive and convincing as Constable's East Bergholt."34 Through such analogies a complex transformation was enacted, re- sulting in the creation of what we might term a twentieth-century "urban pastoral." During the previous century, the unchanging countryside, rendered as the "pastoral," was proffered as the bedrock on which the strengths of the nation were based, an antidote to the city as a site of squalor and change, a psychic and real space that would revivify the nation's moral fiber. The interwar years in Britain witnessed a renewed infatuation with these themes and a concomitant deification of the pastoral in the face of the rapid development of arterial highways, ribbon development, and new out-of-town housing estates. E. 0. Hoppe's Picturesque Great Britain (1926) sanitized and sentimentalized rural England, as did H. V Morton's major best-seller, In Search of England, first published in 1927 and in its twenty-ninth edition by 1943.35 Despite the prevalence of rural nostalgia between the wars, however, this is also an era in which a corresponding urban pastoral was consoli- dated. Even Morton, most associated with the impulses of rural nostalgia, spoke in awe of the industrial landscape: "Mill towns look grandly impressive from a hill," he wrote, although he then promptly added that once one descended into their streets, "the stark ugliness of the long, barracky, prison-like houses . . . gives you an ache" an ache, of course, for which consolation was to be found in the "amazing greenness of England."36 If Morton stepped back from finding lasting beauty in the industrial landscape, others did not and instead began to aestheticize such landscapes. Edmund Vale, for example, in North Country, his contribution 130 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">to Batsford's highly successful series, "The Face of Britain," viewed factories as "engrossing," part of an environment "ennobled by a strange beauty of stal- wartness."37 "Beauty" in the industrial North in the 1930s was often discovered by middle- class observers journeying there and finding, much to their relief, that the workers they encountered were peaceful members of elaborate, richly-textured communi- ties. Such observers represented those communities and their inhabitants in senti- mental and romantic terms. Vale, for example, noted that workers had "contrived with great spirit to master the fiend of the Depression and live in a cheerful and orderly manner."38 Likewise, William Empson, literary theorist of the pastoral par excellence, offered an outline of an urban pastoral through the praise he lavished on documentary filmmakers like John Grierson, whose work, he argued, gave a "pastoral feeling" to the dignity of labor.39 The pastoralization of the industrial North in the 1930s was widespread, and one of its effects was to render the region devoid of threatening political agency. Moreover, Lowry's work was linked to this increasingly romanticized landscape. In 1939, for example, Eric Newton offered a reading of Lowry that countered the "political Lowry" put forward by Klingender and that would become ascendant after the war. One could, wrote Newton, view industrial conditions in the North with bitter hatred and become a social reformer, or one could view them "with a tender and rather compassionate love that goes even deeper than hatred." According to Newton, this is what Lowry did, a painter whose "love of the scene gives his anthropomorphic blackbeetles a quality of fairy- land and turns the sordidness into poetry"40 Throughout his wartime commentar- ies on art in the Sunday Times, Newton continued to praise the advent of the urban pastoral, viewing it as the beginning of a renaissance in English art. Lowry's vision was centrally inscribed in the new, urban pastoral, but in the process the "political Lowry" vanished and Lowryscapes became "fairylands" that the entire nation at war was invited to celebrate. Not only were Lowry's urban landscapes depoliticized and aestheticized in the hands of critics like Newton, they also came to be identified with a specific region of the nation, serving as visual signifiers of the North at precisely the time the region was being mapped by other social explorers and documentarists. By the 1 950s, the equation of Lowry and the North was complete: "Lowry is Lancashire to his finger tips," wrote G. B. Cotton, a Lancashire librarian; Lowry's work embod- ied the "northern spirit," wrote the critic T. G. Rosenthal, transmuting its land- scapes into "artistic gold"; Lowry projected "Lancashire onto the larger screen of national perception," noted Hugh Scrutton, director of Liverpool's Walker Gal- lery.4 The Lancashire these critics praised Lowry for projecting, however, was a world that had been highly sanitized, a Lancashire where industry was fast becom- ing industrial heritage and where, as Mervyn Levy put it, grime and squalor had become, in Lowry's hands, "something very clean and pure, even poetic."42 That this version of the "English Lowry," of the North as poetic fantasyland, became so L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 131</page><page sequence="12">widespread in the 1 950s owed much to the fact that the world Lowry painted was now in the process of being radically transformed. As one critic noted, Lowry "paradoxically became a national institution when many of the townscapes that inspired him have crashed before the demolition squads."43 Lowry's status in this decade also owed much to the intellectual ambivalence about the postwar welfare state that was eradicating the world of poverty that Lowry had painted between the wars. Rothenstein, for example, was grateful that Lowry did not paint the "drab uniformity" that, for him, characterized the postwar world and that he believed resulted from the egalitarian ideals and rational planning brought about by the welfare state. Instead, Lowry's focus remained on the "squalid disorder" of the past, a world for which, in the 1 950s, Rothenstein and many other critics developed an intense, nostalgic, and sentimental attachment.44 In the next section of this essay I will begin to chart the ways in which Lowry's popularity after the war depended on an appreciation of the nostalgic currency of his images, a currency that had first been minted by critics like these. Suffice it to say here that this particular Lowry the Lowry whose paintings had come to symbolize the North and had been cast in the mode of the urban pastoral while born in the 1930s and cultivated in the 1940s, only reached maturity in the 1950s. During that decade, when so many Lowry reproductions came to adorn the walls of so many homes, their meaning was hard to extricate from an entire critical apparatus that had concocted the "English Lowry." Furthermore, during that de- cade, Lowry's representations of the North became so ubiquitous that they were now "indistinguishable from the reality" they depicted, "accepted as the Author- ised Version of life in the north."45 Once this had occurred, it became possible for the North to be enacted through Lowry, to find its voice by imitating Lowry's work. Thus, whenJohn Read produced the first BBC television documentary about Lowry in 1958, he juxtaposed photographs of the northern industrial landscape with Lowry's paintings of that landscape because, for him, the former were reminis- cent of the latter. Two million viewers watched Read's program; they were offered a lesson in seeing the world Lowry painted as "extraordinarily beautiful" and taught to interpret documentary evidence of "the real" through the aesthetics of Lowry as framed by Read and other critics who understood him through the prism of the urban pastoral.46 By the time Read made his program for the BBC, the North had indeed been recast in the contemporary imagination as a Lowryscape. Two decades later, an- other documentary film also assumed that Lowry had captured the truth of the North and offered his paintings as evidence of "the real" rather than as highly mediated representations of it.47 At the same time, Manchester's touring theater group, the Shuttle Company, brought Lowry's paintings to life in its production, "Lowry Street." In that play, the practices of everyday working-class life, as re- corded by Lowry, were reenacted on stage, contributing still further to the process of authenticating Lowry's version of life in the North.48 The transformation was 132 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">complete: first Lowry painted the North; then the critics both romanticized his canvases and said that he had painted the North as it really was; finally, the North was presented on the national stage as a giant Lowry canvas. Lowry, the Public, and Postwar Urban Renewal The popular appeal of Lowry in the 1950s and after owed little to the "existential Lowry" or the "political Lowry" of the critics. It owed much, however, to their "English Lowry," and to its aestheticized, fairyland version of the North. It was this particular construct of Lowry's importance, disseminated through many radio chats and television documentaries, that framed popular readings of the mil- lions of prints of his industrial scenes that rolled off the presses after the war. By 1961, as the Lancashire writer Shelagh Delaney noted, reproductions of Lowry's works were hung in schools throughout Salford (in hers it was "Coming from the Mill"); every child in the city grew up, Delaney wrote, "as I grew up, with this artist's vision of their own particular world before them."49 The circulation of Low- ryscapes that made her experience possible owes much to advances in color print technology; it also owes a great deal to Lowry's recognition that money could be made by capitalizing on the desire for copies of his work. The first inexpensive print of a Lowry canvas was probably his "Punch and Judy," released in large numbers in 1947 and reissued in a signed, numbered, and limited edition by the Sunday Observer in 1972. By the time the Observer entered the fray, many organiza- tions were offering limited editions of Lowry's works, including the Heritage Club, the Adam Collection, Ganymed Original Editions, and even the Royal Academy.50 The limited edition prints need not detain us here. But it is important to note that cheap reproductions of Lowry's paintings, of the sort encountered by Delaney in her school or purchased by Carolyn Steedman's mother, also proliferated after the war. The Medici Society entered the Lowry business early on and still trades heavily in postcards and small prints of his industrial landscapes; Boots, the chem- ists, successfully sold Lowry prints in the 1960s, and, more recently, art galleries in possession of Lowry originals have capitalized on the market for them. The shop and lobby of the Salford Art Gallery and Museum, for example, is littered with hundreds of copies of inexpensive framed and unframed Lowrys, mostly printed by the Medici Society or Mainstone Publications. According to a mid-1970s poll to determine the best-selling prints in Britain, Lowry's "The Mill, Early Morning" came in seventh, and John Mainstone has stressed the enormous success of his company's prints of Lowry's industrial landscapes, especially "V E. Day" (1945). While less in demand than they were in the 1960s and 1970s, Lowryscapes are still ordered in runs of five thousand from Mainstone by framing concerns in the Manchester area.5' Lowry's most popular print with visitors to the Salford Gallery L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 133</page><page sequence="14">is "Coming from the Mill," which is often bought because it reminds its purchasers of the locale in which they once lived or worked or because it is intended as a gift for friends and relatives who are about to move (or who have moved) away from the area, a souvenir of a world already lost.52 One retired Bolton millworker argued in the 1970s that Lowry was popular because he "saw what many of the old generation saw and experienced."53 We might add that Lowry saw what many of these individuals were increasingly unable to see quite so readily once the world he painted began to be torn apart. And this brings us to the need to relate Lowry's immense postwar popularity to the context in which his prints were received that of the massive reconstruction of the built environment in postwar Britain. The need to repair houses bombed in the war and to reinstate policies of "slum clearance" halted by the war occupied Labour and Conservative governments after 1945. While 245,000 houses had been demolished in Britain between the wars, 1.3 million more were razed between 1955 and 1975, an era of urban redevelop- ment that displaced some three million people.54 Some regions of the nation were more prone to the wrecker's ball than others, Manchester and Salford being subject to some of the most systematic redevelopment. The bulldozing of Manchester's Hulme-Moss Side districts was one of the most ambitious "slum clearance" projects in Europe, rehousing some thirty thousand people. In Salford, across the river, entire districts were transformed, the result of the comprehensive redevelopment plan of 1951. Some 1,000 new houses had been built by the end of 1954, two years before the first high-rise block of flats, Clement Attlee House, was opened. Another 22,000 were cleared between 1955 and 1975, and by the end of the 1970s it was reported that 44.3 percent of all homes in Salford had been built since 1944. Per capita, more dwellings were demolished in Salford between 1955 and 1965 than in any other city in the nation, leading one observer to note that "there can be few places in Britain which have been so comprehensively altered in such a short time."55 Critics of postwar urban redevelopment have been keen to point out that it was not only buildings that were destroyed in the process of reconstruction but also the very fabric of the traditional working-class community. Nevertheless, throughout the 1950s many residents of the "slums" were eager to move to new homes. In one survey of 250 families rehoused on an estate in Worsley, eight miles from the center of Salford, it was found that 90 percent of them wanted to leave their old homes but only 54 percent wished to move so far from the city center. Although residents on the new estate often missed established neighborhood ties in Salford, only 17 percent desired to return. The others simply began to relinquish the "intimate social life of the slums" for the "more reserved, home-centred life of the typical middle-class suburb."56 While it is thus abundantly clear that there was consider- able support for the new housing programs, it is also clear that those programs gave rise to a wholly new urban landscape that disrupted traditional patterns of 134 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">social life and, as one analyst noted, imposed "an alien palimpsest of streets and buildings" on an older environment without wholly eradicating all traces of the world it replaced.57 This was certainly true in Salford, where, in 1980, the official city guide noted triumphantly that another 15,000 houses had been cleared in the 1970s and that the dark, smoky world that had been recorded by Walter Green- wood, Robert Roberts, and L. S. Lowry "is now a memory."58 It was a memory- linked to nostalgia for a fast-disappearing world that was, however, both cher- ished and actively cultivated. It was, moreover, a memory that Lowry's works played a crucial role in sustaining. As the critic Mervyn Levy has suggested, just as Marcel Proust and his madeleines helped in remembering childhoods lost, so Lowry and his industrial landscapes contributed to the process of remembering working-class pasts lost.59 Nostalgia for the world of mills and cobbled streets, and for the communities and community spirit that sustained them, is not merely a product of the recent heritage industry and its own appropriations of Lowry. Richard Hoggart's classic study of that world, The Uses of Literacy (1957), is certainly the best known of the many laments for the traditional working-class community that appeared after the war, offering a nostalgic affirmation of the values and strengths of a way of life that was in rapid decline. Other writers, however, shared Hoggart's sentiments; Charles Taylor suggested that the most urgent job of the day was "to rescue the old commu- nities" in the face of creeping alienation brought about by the advent of a new, "mass society."60 The communal spirit that activated those "old communities" was a highly sought-after commodity, at least by intellectuals of the day. But according to the contemporary sociologist Norman Dennis, that spirit could not be reactivated on the new housing estates because the rapid and brutal transformation of the built environment disrupted the vital flow of memories required to sustain it. Commu- nity spirit, Dennis claimed, emerged from the sharing of common experiences, which was rare on the new estates. Moreover making a point germane to my argument here he also noted that the "possibility of the accretion of a fund of shared memories is further lowered in housing estates by the fact that each genera- tion is dispersed. People on the new estates do not share a history."' Redevelop- ment had, in short, led to detachment from the past and a subsequent crisis of memory. Dennis noted what few others did, namely that in destroying the old working- class neighborhoods redevelopment also destroyed the basis for those forms of collective memory that were necessary for community spirit to flourish. Postwar housing programs, symbols of Britain's moment of modernity, often demanded the bulldozing of vast urban areas, the likes of which Lowry had once painted, resulting in the experience of cultural dislocation. Many people found themselves severed from those former structures of community life that had generated stable forms of collective memory necessary for the flourishing of community spirit; they expe- rienced a breakage of ties to the past, a wiping out of what came before, and a L.

But in Britain in the 1950s, the pressure to forget was paralleled by a desire to remember, and it is no accident that urban renewal was accompanied by an intense interest in collecting those objects that could serve, in part, both to resurrect a lost past and to reconnect people to it.Just as the arrival of artistic modernism in Britain generated many attempts to recuperate a native tradition of "English" art (to which, as we have seen, Lowry was attached), so the modernization of the built environment generated an interest in preserving and celebrating the remnants of a vanishing landscape. Lowry's urban pastoral became popular after the war because, in an age dominated by both a breakage with the past and a corresponding desire to deny that breakage, his images both fuelled and shaped the desire for the past. In short, reproductions of his industrial landscapes became landscapes of memory, serving an important mnemonic function amidst the cultural dislocations of the postwar world. Shirley Baker's Street Photographs can help make some of these points more readily apparent. Between 1960 and 1973, Baker documented the demise of the traditional working-class community in the Northwest. In his introduction to her book, Stephen Constantine wrote that her photographs preserved a particular mo- L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 137</page><page sequence="18">ment, one immortalized by Lowry, and thus stimulated "the memory of those who knew these times."62 Baker made a similar point. Wandering through half- demolished streets, she wrote, was "like standing on an empty stage; the actors had gone and there was nothing to show who they were or what the play had been about. Memories linger, but without some hint or trace of reality, they too die out and come to nothing."63 Attempting to give substance to those memories, Baker offered a series of images intended to reconnect individuals to a fast-disappearing world. Her book opens by documenting street life in the traditional working-class community (fig. 4); it then moves to record the demolition of those communities; and it concludes with images of the new tower blocks under construction. The new structures, however, are always depicted in the distance: while in the first part of the book Baker literally places herself in the very heart of the community she is documenting, here she positions herself at a distance, portraying the new as an alien and ominous presence on the horizon (fig. 5). It is a presence, however, that never completely eradicates the reminders of an older world: cobbled streets, some leading nowhere, still remain, shorn of the terraced houses that once adorned them and gave them life. The old landscape has not vanished entirely, and it is through the surviving traces of that landscape that connection to the past can be sought. In her final photographs, we find people appearing as if they are searching for a resurrection of traces that would once again make the vanished world come alive, that would make it whole. Since the 1950s, the appetite for those traces has been voracious. That appetite has, in part, contributed to Lowry's popularity, because his paintings can be seen to populate those desolate streets afresh, connecting indi- viduals to a world that is increasingly difficult to find (fig. 6). Art, Memory, and Everyday Life If modernity entails both dislocation and a rupture in historical con- sciousness, then one of its by-products is nostalgia for older, presumably more set- tled, ways of life and for the places in which past lives were lived. As the phenome- nologist Edward Casey has noted, it "is the stabilizing persistence of place as a container of experiences that contributes so powerfully to its intrinsic memorabil- ity."64 Moreover, while any given place can situate one's memorial life, artifacts evocative of that place can serve a similar mnemonic function when the place that gave rise to them no longer exists as it once did. The keenest observer of this process is Walter Benjamin, who once lamented, "I have to make do with what is resurrected only today, isolated pieces of interior that have broken away and yet contain the whole within them, while the whole . .. has lost its details without trace."65 For Benjamin, memory is only possible when we have a stock of powerful talismans to remind us of how things used to be, or, to borrow again from Casey, "things congeal the places we remember, just as places congeal remembered 138 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="19">worlds."66 The souvenir such as a Lowry print-is one such object that can func- tion to authenticate the past and stimulate the memory of it; as Susan Stewart argues, such objects are both samples of lost experience and artifacts evocative of that experience.67 In recent years, a number of writers have begun to explore how works of art can engender recollection by visually evoking lost worlds.68 Anticipating these de- velopments, two psychologists, writing in 1951, offered their own study of memory and pictorial imagery, focusing on the work of Lowry. They suggested that memory entailed a process of dissociation, and they attributed Lowry's popularity to the fact that the processes of dissociation they discovered in their patients were similar to those they noted in Lowry's paintings. Lowry, they wrote, "reveals himself as a spectator," assuming a position "of looking down on this world from a height."69 It is certainly the case, as many critics have pointed out, that Lowry viewed the scenes he depicted from a distance and as an outsider. As we know, Lowry was a rent collector, a voyeur of working-class life who rarely focused upon domestic or factory interiors; the life of the street was for the most part all he had available to him. But in his paintings the life of the street, and indeed of the entire industrial landscape, was usually viewed from above, or cut off by a horizontal line, accentuat- ing its separateness from the observer (fig. 7).7 In this respect his works engaged in a key representational practice that I would argue is central to the urban pastoral, that of rendering the industrial landscape as "beauty" by visualizing it from afar. Just as Morton claimed that mill towns looked "grandly impressive" from a hill, so Vale's North Country often portrayed them from such a vantage point as early as 1937 (fig. 8), contributing to a mode of visual representation that has enjoyed a long history. As Terry Lovell has noted, British realism continued to emphasize the long shot of the working-class community in the 1960s, both in the opening se- quence of the popular television serial Coronation Street, which establishes a visual point of reference "outside and above" the street, and in the film of Shelagh Dela- ney's A Taste of Honey, in which the viewer is inscribed as an outsider, looking down on the industrial town from a surrounding hill.71 The crucial point here is that just as Lowry was a voyeur of the traditional working-class community between the wars, many people who had once lived in those communities were positioned as voyeurs of them after the war. Often living on the new housing estates, they had been detached from the older world Lowry painted. Even if they desired to be part of that world again-to be on the inside, as was Shirley Baker in her studies of the old communities before their destruction- this was increasingly difficult. But there were images available to them of their own past way of life that could help engender memories of it. This was an important function of Lowry's prints, because, as one critic noted, echoing Casey, "nothing conjures up nostalgia like a sense of place, and Lowry certainly had that."72 None- theless, while Lowry's distance from the world he painted was spatial, that of many of his postwar admirers was temporal. Their own particular sense of dislocation, L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 139</page><page sequence="20">FIGURE 7. The industrial landscape from a hill, Lowry style. L. S.

One critic has noted that Lowry's paintings are imaginative visual documentaries that function on the level of storytelling.73 By examining the actual stories told about the working-class past by many worker- writers after the war, and by studying the homologous structures of those stories and Lowry's industrial landscapes, we can develop further ways of accounting for his postwar appeal. Oral history projects often "encourage people to recover their memory and contribute to constructing a sense of collective identity at the very moment when the groups they represent are dying or dead."714 Creating a "topology of commu- nity," asJoanna Bornat terms it, such projects often began in Britain after postwar reconstruction work had significantly altered the spatial environment familiar to many older people.75 Severed from the old communities, people were encouraged to remember those communities and to reconstruct their everyday lives within them through the practice of autobiography. In Salford, beginning in the 1970s, 140 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="21">FIGURE 8. The industrial landscape from a hill, 1930s documentary style.

Reproduced by permission of The British Library; shelfmark WP1 1741. several oral history projects were established, resulting in the publication oftestimo- nies to the lost world with which Lowry was increasingly associated.76 The first point to be noted about these works is the ways in which their temporal structure differs significantly from that of the classic autobiography penned by Victorian autodidacts. The latter mapped selves in motion, progressing through time from pit to Parliament, from workhouse to Westminster. Whereas classic auto- didact narratives recounted a story of progress in which past and present were linked, the Salford autobiographies of the 1980s sever past and present, constituting a "before" and an "after" and focusing almost exclusively on the former; they posit a breakage with the past, with a world they attempt to recuperate through writing. Moreover, there is no sense of closure in these works; they merely dredge up vast chunks of lost experience, ending abruptly, usually at some point in the 1940s or 1950s. Whereas the past in autodidact narratives constituted the soil in which the present was nurtured, in these works the past is viewed as wholly discontinuous with the present, disrupted by the present, desirable and yet difficult to retrieve. Instead of celebrating the moment of arrival in the present, as did Victorian autodi- dacts, Salford autobiographers lament the loss of the past. As such, they are all L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 141</page><page sequence="22">exercises in nostalgia: "There are now no small communities with local churches but soul-less high rise flats and plastic shopping centres"; "We should've never pulled them houses down"; "Salford then was a place of character"; "I will always look upon those times with a great feeling of nostalgia" these are some of the laments."7 Second, these Salford studies are also Geertzian exercises in thick description of a vanished past, a slice of everyday life severed from the present. Their focus is entirely on the mundane and the ordinary family and kinship ties, the corner shop, street life, local entertainments, laundry day, shopping, and the like. Even events like Sunday School outings are mapped as an aberration from the important taxonomy of "everyday happenings."78 Archaeologies of the particular and excava- tions of the densities of everyday life, these works also focus on the difficulty of memory, on its fragility, and on the need to codify its products: "Now that the bulldozers destroy the rows of terraced houses," asserts one study, "I feel this story must be told, otherwise memory will go into oblivion."79 Like Walter Benjamin, these writers experience the difficulty of memory and yet persist in their reconstruc- tion work, making use of the traces, vaguely remembered incidents, and representa- tions that remain. As one of them notes, "Childhood is a period that vanishes in a flash, although in more leisurely moments a single incident may kindle a whole phase of half-forgotten memories."80 The point is this: Like Lowry, these autobiographers in Salford were outsiders, cut off from those scenes they could only represent from a distance as "a solitary outpost from a vanishing past," to quote one of Lowry's critics.8' Their works are to cite Berger's assessment of Lowry's work imbued by an "essential change- lessness," because, like Lowry, they were happiest between the wars, and that is the world they desired to reconstitute.82 As many critics have noted, Lowry attempted to deep-freeze the world of his youth: the clothes, factories, and street furniture in his canvases remained in the style of the interwar years, even in his postwar works. Each day he would return home after work and contribute to his visual diary, "which increasingly became a memory of things as they were,"83 resulting, as one observer has noted, in paintings that were little more than an "ambitious exercise in social cryogenics."84 So, too, are most of the autobiographies discussed earlier, works that also freeze the world between the wars and in so doing contribute to our own topographies of the traditional working-class community. Finally, and also like Lowry's paintings, these autobiographical narratives are composites, consisting of virtually interchangeable parts. It has been noted that Lowry seldom painted any specific scene, but rather constructed each of his paintings out of the miscellaneous sketches in his notebooks in order to create what became a generic industrial land- scape; he selected some elements of the scene around him, reduced them to basic forms, and recombined them in new ways again and again.85 This resulted in a repetition of a familiar stock of images, just as in the Salford reminiscences there 142 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="23">is also repetition across them, a constant rearrangement of a common stock of stories about the industrial past. In short, like Lowry's industrial landscapes, these reminiscences consolidate a particular series of images of the traditional working-class community. In addition, they constitute particular memories, and not others, and delineate the boundaries of memory through what they include and exclude. Moreover, we know that at least in one instance these two modes of representing the North, the visual and the autobiographical, overlapped in significant ways. In 1957 Lowry painted his "Old Road, Failsworth." He did so not from his memory, nor from the sketches in his notebooks, nor from actually having recorded the place as it once had been. In- stead, RuthJohnson, who wrote her own autobiographical reminiscence of life in Failsworth, told her story to Lowry, who subsequently represented the world she described in a painting that appeared as the frontispiece to her book. Johnson's editor wrote that, despite fifty years of change in Failsworth, memories of its inter- war past remained "untarnished and intact."86 ButJohnson's memories were artic- ulated at a specific historical moment, one in which a number of other memories, traces, and images including those painted by Lowry-informed her own story. That story shaped one of Lowry's industrial landscapes, which, in turn, served as yet one more memory trace in the repertoire of images that consolidated the working-class past. Representations Without Pity After the war Lowry came to share with his admirers a sense of loss and a concomitant longing for the world as it had been. He always admitted he was happiest in the 1920s and claimed he got a "bit wistful" for the "old Salford." In the 1950s and 1960s, he found it difficult to return to scenes he had once painted, only to find them in a state of flux. In an interview he gave in 1965, he claimed that despite the need for progress he did not approve of the changes and wished the old slums had not been pulled down.87 Like many of those who were purchasing his prints, Lowry came to believe that once upon a time in the past life had been much richer. Artist and audience were both severed from a whole way of life that, while being eroded, was still highly desired; they discovered a mutual affinity in their dislocation, the representations of the former serving in part to give form to the nostalgia of the latter. In short, Lowry's industrial landscapes evoked a world that was increasingly lost and this is why they appealed to those who suffered that loss, despite the fact that the world for which they pined was in part a fabrication of the art of its demise. In his preface to Shelley Rohde's biography of Lowry,John Rothenstein, always eager to champion an "English Lowry" as a foil to the "political Lowry" of the L. S. Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 143</page><page sequence="24">Left, claimed that Lowry offered his viewers "representations without pity." Ac- cording to Rothenstein, those representations neither satirized nor idealized the world they portrayed, and neither did they offer any social commentary.88 While pity for the lives of those he painted might indeed not be a notable feature of Lowry's paintings, many of those who admired him after the war shared his sense of loss, perhaps pitied their own sense of dislocation, certainly romanticized the world Lowry portrayed, and often viewed Lowry as doing the same. Despite Ro- thenstein's claim that Lowry did not idealize the North, others have argued that he did, that his paintings assert "an Elysian fabrication of the north as he wanted it to be."89 Moreover, Lowry became popular at the moment when many others began to share a desire for that fabrication. As Peter Fuller has so eloquently stated, Lowry posited a return to Eden and found a land "flowing with milk and honey not in some estranged vision of utopia, but in the smoky heart of the city itself."90 It was a land to which, on some level, many others wished to return. If Lowry came to symbolize both the North and the "genius of English paint- ing," he is now being rewarded for his efforts (and the efforts made on his behalf) by the construction of a Lowry Center in Salford. "The Lowry," one of Britain's Millennium Projects, funded in part by the National Lottery, will include two theaters, exhibition space, and the Lowry galleries when completed in 2000. It is expected to attract some 2.5 million visitors a year, many of whom will hear "the Lowry Story" in the Lowry Study Center.9' Lowry will be reconstituted again, this time by the burgeoning heritage industry. But that is another story. It is, perhaps, also an unlikely story, given the recent attempts to challenge his continuing influ- ence. Long before Lowry was popular with the general public, he was, as we have seen, actively championed by the critics. But when his images were widely circu- lated, when he became admired by the lumpen populace, when, God forbid, the Queen bought one of his paintings, and when, as WaldemarJanuszczak put it, he was cast "as a kind of Mr Pastry in sparkling clogs," many members of the art establishment turned their backs on him.92 In a late 1980s Royal Academy survey of British art in the twentieth century, Lowry's name was conspicuous by its ab- sence. The initial "discovery" of Lowry owed much to the effects of the Depression and the war, both of which turned the nation's attention to the North and the lives of its inhabitants. Lowry's popularity, by contrast, was related in complex ways to a series of dislocations experienced in the early postwar years. But these two historical moments have both passed, and with them, perhaps, so has Lowry's representa- tional significance in the post-postwar world. Even the cities of the North are now tired of being rendered a Lowryscape: "It's time someone painted a new picture of the North West," claims one advertisement for a forum to promote new business opportunities in the region. Full of irony, whether intended or not, it uses Lowry's painting, 'An Accident," in its attempt to remap that part of the nation that Lowry once put on the map in a very particular way (fig. 9). 144 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="25">| ~IT'S TIME SOMEONEl PAINTED A NEW PICTURE OF TH E NO RTH W ES T It this is how you visualise the North West. business personalities and the heads of leading you re certainly behind the times.

The study is flawed in its conclusions, however, insofar as it did not consider the significant number of people who actually returned to Salford.

Lowry and the Landscape of Memory in Postwar Britain 149</page><page sequence="30">oral history projects demanded this focus on the past, resulting in works that differ structurally from the classic autodidact narrative. While this is indeed the case, I would argue that it is not only theform of reminiscence that is responsible for the temporal rupture on which I focus here, but also the context in which these reminiscences were collected, namely the massive social dislocation that resulted from postwar devel- opment. 78.
