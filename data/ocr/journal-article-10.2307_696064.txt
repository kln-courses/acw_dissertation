<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE. The Religious Experience of the Roman People, from the Earliest Times to the Age of Augustus. The Gifford Lectures for 19o9-1o delivered in Edinburgh University by W. WARDE FOWLER, M.A. Pp. xviii + 504. London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd. 1911. Price 12s. net. THE publication of Mr. Warde Fowler's Gifford Lectures is an occasion of con- siderable importance. Not only is this the first comprehensive study in English of the development of Roman religion-- Dr. J. B. Carter's Religion of Numa was a series of brilliant essays rather than a connected history-but, what is more important, it stands by itself as an attempt to get behind cult and custom to the ideas and feelings which prompted them, and were in fact the religious experience of the Roman people. Mr. Fowler's qualification for this task is in one respect obvious: no English scholar (and very few elsewhere) is better acquainted with the evidence, literary, epigraphical, and archaeological on which the study must be based, or with the mass of modern writing which has grown up around it. But he possesses also the rarer and higher qualification of a genuine and pene- trating sympathy: for him the evidence is not merely an antiquarian record of dead practices and formulae, but the living effort of a growing people to understand the workings of the Power manifest in the world and to put them- selves in right relation to it. In other words, Mr. Fowler knows himself to be studying a living religion and can put himself in the place of those to whom it was real and vital. But the adoption of this sympathetic</page><page sequence="2">224 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW attitude involves in the case of Roman religion more than ordinary difficulties; for its very possibility has become a matter of controversy. The tendency of modern criticism has been to regard the genuine religion of ancient Rome as a mass of stereotyped formalism, based on a cold and calculating attitude to- wards 'the powers,' and uninspired by any really religious emotion. This con- clusion is no doubt very largely due to the nature of the extant evidence: though, as De Marchi has shown, something can be done by careful research to piece together details of the private cults, in which a much more genuine spirit of religious feeling sur- vived, the mass of our evidence is con- cerned with the organised state-cult, whose very creation implied, as Mr. Fowler has shown, the shifting of the burden of responsibility from the indi- vidual-or rather from the household-- to state officials, and the consequent decay of vital religious experience. Almost more is it due to the chance that the earliest modern critics of Roman religion-especially Mommsen -approached it from the legal point of view, and concentrating their attention on the ius divinum and the 'contract- notion' hardly paused to inquire what lay behind them. Against these diffi- culties Mr. Fowler has had, in the earlier part of his book, to contend con- tinuously, and though the ease of his style and the saneness of his judgment may often disguise the extent of this struggle, no student of the subject can read these lectures without perceiving how much sifting of accepted opinions and re-consideration of authoritative judgments underlie the apparent facility of his conclusions. Typical of his work on these lines are the Lectures on Ritual (viii. and ix.). There the ac- cepted theory was the legal conception of the contrast: the worshipper with scrupulous exactness presented the gods with their due, and they in their turn were under an obligation to make a return in the shape of temporal bless- ings and advantages. Mr. Fowler meets this theory in two ways: he shows, in the first place, that it was largely based on the examination of the votum, and that although the votapublica did in their stereotyped form approach to an almost commercial pattern, yet evenr in them the notion of the human conditional promise is much more prominent than that of a divine obliga- tion. In other forms of prayer, such as that of the lustratio, the latter idea is completely absent : the worshipper makes his offering and presents his prayer in the hope indeed of fulfilment, but with no sense of an exercise of con- straint over the Powers. Secondly, in a section of peculiar interest (pp. 185- 191), Mr. Fowler shows that there was indeed an interacting relation between worshipper and numen in the ritual of sacrifice, but that the underlying notion is one of mutual help rather than mutual obligation. The key to the right under- standing of Roman ritual is the very primitive notion, expressed in the re- current formula, macte esto, that the worshipper by his sacrifice communi- cates new strength to the deity, and prays that that strength may be used for his benefit. The demonstration of this idea is in itself a great advance in the sympathetic interpretation of Roman ritual: its acceptance might mark a real change in critical attitude. It represents in fact just what Mr. Fowler wishes to establish in the narrower as well as the wider sense-a new understanding of the word religio (pp. 21, 37, etc.). Not less sane, but perhaps more subtly sympathetic, is Mr. Fowler's treatment of more recent criticism of Roman religion. This has been made chiefly from the point of view of anthropology: writers eager to find support for general theories of primitive belief and custom have discovered in Roman ritual traces of 'taboo,' magic, the magician-king, the dominating worship of the oak, and so on. Mr. Fowler does not deny the existence of such traces, fossilised here and there in rites and customs, but on many points he checks the excessive zeal of these 'discoverers' (e.g. pp. 51, 141 n. I), and above all he claims for the Roman belief, even in its earliest stage of the animistic worship of the numina, the dignity of a true religion, the recognition by man of superior powers on whom he is himself depen- dent, as opposed to a claim to constrain</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 225 such powers by his own magic authority. To one recent theory Mr. Fowler now inclines, the idea that we have enshrined in Roman cult traces of the superposi- tion of one form of religion on another, possibly that of the worship of a con- quering race on the lower beliefs of less civilised aborigines. This notion, which has been so prominent of late years in the study of Greek religion, may be destined to bear considerable fruit in the explanation of Roman cults as well: Mr. Fowler has shown how it might be used in his own most illuminating com- parison of the two attitudes towards the dead attested in the Lemuria and the Parentalia (pp. 393-395), and it is foreshadowed again in Dr. Deubner's theory of the Lupercalia (Appendix II. pp. 478-480). In these earlier lectures the author has in this way done much to clear the ground for future study by setting in their true proportion the anthropological contributions to the interpretation of Roman religion, and suggesting the lines on which we may hope to arrive at an understanding of what the multiform cult of the early Roman meant to the worshipper and how far it was an influence in his life. In the second half of his lectures Mr. Fowler is on less controversial ground, but his work is none the less important and interesting. As is in- evitable from his main theory, he is bound to begin tracing decay at a much earlier period than that in which it has been seen by most previous critics: if the reality of the Roman religion lay in the simple worship of the agricultural household, then the state-organisation, which the Roman regarded with pride as the great religious work of the nation, was in itself the first step in degenera- tion, for its formalities excluded true religious experience. Mr. Fowler traces the further process of decay due to the introduction of the di novensiles, cults without religious significance (p. 236), and the materialisation of conceptions of the divine under the influence of Greek anthropomorphism (c. xi.). Of special interest are the lectures on that difficult subject, the work of the pontifices (xii.),-though here one would have liked a rather more detailed treatment of the vexed question of the indigitamenta-and the necess'arily tentative exposition (xiii.) of the underlying intention of the art of augury (shall we not ultimately have to work back to a period when the bird and the lightning were not mere signals, but were themselves divine ?). The strange revival of religio in the Hannibalic War, with its resulting innovations, is admir- ably dealt with; there is a most pene- trating chapter on Epicurism and Stoicism (xvi.), followed by two illumi- nating lectures on Virgil and Augustus' attempted revival, in which the contrast, not always clearly enough realised, be- tween the motives and intentions of the poet and the statesman is effectively brought out. Finally, we have a sugges- tive but perhaps inevitably disappointing chapter on the contributions of the old Roman religion towards the building up of Christianity. Throughout the central idea of religious experience is kept in view and treated in immediate relation to the history of the people. It is not easy in a work whose main theme carries so much conviction, when it is written, too, with the caution and accuracy which we have all learnt to expect from its author, to find much material for adverse criticism except in minutiae; but there are perhaps certain things one misses in these lectures to which attention may be called. Would it not, for instance, have been worth while, in spite of the obscurity of the subject and the scantiness of evidence, to have made some reference to the worship of the gentes as a possible link between the household and the state ? De Marchi has shown that there is material enough for some general con- clusions. Or, again, in the treatment of the VIth Aeneid (c. xviii. pp. 420 ff.), the whole purpose of the lectures would have been well served by an ampler demonstration of the way in which Virgil has harmonised so many of the ideas of earlier religion and philosophy. In the account of Epicurism, too (xvi.), Mr. Fowler has hardly allowed enough for the really religious conception of the gods as the realised ideal of Epicurean morality: if modern critics are right in supposing that Lucretius intended to conclude his poem with a fuller account of the gods, this would have been clear: but there is evidence enough NO. CCXXI. VOL. XXV. P</page><page sequence="4">226 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW even without it. These howvever are small blemishes, and on the other hand one might quote many incidental sug- gestions which throw light on dark places, szuh, for instance, as the theory of Mars in his double character of IaroTpo6ratoq in peace and war (p. 134), or the explanation of the mysterious Moles Martis and Virites Quirini, etc., in opposition to Dr. Frazer's theory of the 'married pairs' (pp. 154 ff). For such details as these, no less than for its main attitude of sympathetic insight, Mr. Fowler's book is likely to remain for long not merely the most attractive account of the Roman religion for the general reader, but a storehouse of sug- gestive material for the specialist and the student.
