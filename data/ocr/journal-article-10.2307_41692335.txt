Crescent Publishing House, Ghaziabad ; pp. xxi + 238; 16 plates ; Price Rs. 75/- One is indeed happy to receive this new publication from Ghaziabad which originally was a dissertation submitted to the A. M. University eight years ago. The present reviewer takes this opportunity to congratulate Prof. Khan of the M. M. H. College for the success in publishing his doctoral work. Through the pages, one comes across the marks of the able guidance and supervision of Dr. Mantini Prasad and Dr. Tripathi. In the foreword Dr. Suryakant informs us that it was he who asked the author to undertake the study of Sarasvatï for Ph. D. The present reviewer, elsewhere, has al- ready referred to a couple of articles on the Puranic epithets of Sarasvatî, written by Dr. Khan. An attempt has been made, in the book under review, to deal broadly with the various aspects of Sarasvatî : as a river ( ch. I. ), river-goddess or goddess of speech ( ch. II-V ) and an anthropomorphic entity in the Purãnas ( ch. VI ). The various allusions made to her by some important classical writers have been brought out briefly in eh. VII. Appendix I includes a study of Sarasvatî with regard to the corresponding deities in Roman and Greek mythologies. Appendix II is the study to include some graphical Sanskrit texts to throw light on the personality of Sarasvatï. There are also plates that are of interest and value from the point of view of art and iconography. The author claims that in this book he has traced the origin and develop- ment of Sarasvatî through Sanskrit literature in historical sequence from the Vedic down to the classical period in an interpretative perspective. It is remarkable that the author has taken pains to consult the libraries in Pune, Varanasi, Delhi, Aligarh, etc. As an introduction to the book, Dr. B. N. Sharma has written a short essay which is important in view of mythology and iconography. The book has also a transliteration table, an index and an attractive wrapper. One may agree with Prof. D. N. Shukla's remark, quoted on the cover, that a thesis means a critical examination with documentary evidences along with a new approach. Equally significant is the fact that the scholars expect something more from the thesis published in a book-form. To quote Dr. Patyal ( BDCRI 38; p. 186 ) : ' Recently Khan has made a detailed study on this topic, but his approach is basically descriptive and does not offer much to many vexed problems'. Sarasvatï is the same legendary river which at one time is supposed to have flowed through Punjab and the south Rajas- tan ( p. 20 ). This debatable issue, in view of the scholars like Patyal, needs çtjll further investigation. So far as the confluence of the three rivers.</page><page sequence="2">280 Annals BORI, IX ( 1979 ) OaãgS, Yamunã and Sarasvatî at Prayag is concerned, it appears to be simply a craving on the part of the religious-minded people to revive the popular notion that the Vedic Sarasvati is still flowing and meets the other two rivers at Prayag ( p. 26 ). But Dr. S. K. Lai ( CASS Studies 5 ) has remarked that there is a grain of truth in this popular belief. The meaning of sarasvat as ' having water ' or ' watery ' is prominent ( p. 68 ). Which- ever connotation we choose for Sarasvãn, he comes in all the cases as the husband of Sarasvati ( p. 70 ). Reference may be made to Lai's view that Sarasvat is conceived as a creator god. It seems to him more likely that when Sarasvati, the river, was given a celestial status and when she was brought on par with the goddesses of fertility, a male consort for her was conceived. Sarasvat, according to him, has been conceived with a definite purpose. The volume is well got-up and the printing is nice. Considering the close relation between a centre of learning and the goddess of learning one may recommend without hesitation that a library connected with thé study of Sanskrit, Indian culture, iconography or Hinduism, should possess and display Sarasvatî in Sanskrit Literature.
