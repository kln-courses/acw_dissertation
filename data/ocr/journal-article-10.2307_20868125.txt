<plain_text><page sequence="1">44 French Studies EARLY MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By Brian J. Levy, University of Hull i. General Litterature. Textes et documents: Moyen Age ? XVIe siecle, ed. Henri Mitterand et at., Nathan, 511 pp., offers many illustrated extracts covering all major fields, with commentary-notes, Franse literatuur van de Middeleeuwen, ed. Rene Stuip, Muiderberg, Coutinho, 240 pp., is an extended essay on OF genres and texts. RR, 79, no. 1, is devoted to 'The legitimacy of the Middle Ages': papers from a 1987 Penn State conference. The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe, ed. George Holmes, OUP, xvi + 398 pp., gives an excellent view of secular and religious lit. and culture, as well as of sociopolitical and artistic matters. Georges Duby assembles previously published essays into two useful volumes under the overall title of Hommes et structures du moyen age: la societe chevaleresque, Flammarion, 224 pp., and Seigneurs et paysans, Flammarion, 288 pp. Bradford B. Broughton, Dictionary of Medieval Knighthood and Chivalry: People, Places and Events, NY, Greenwood, xxii + 774 pp., includes many entries of OF lit. interest, and is a fine companion to B.'s earlier vol. on Concepts and Terms (seeYWMLS, 48:54). A similarly welcome companion vol. is Harper-Bill and Harvey, Ideals, 11, a second selection of Strawberry Hill conference papers (for vol. 1, see YWMLS, 48). I. G. Pierce, 'Arms, armour and warfare in the eleventh century', Anglo-Norman Studies, 10: 237?57, casts new light on epic and romance descriptions with much authoritative detail on the degree of protection afforded by chainmail. J. Flori, 'Encore l'usage de la lance ... La technique du combat chevaleresque vers l'an 1100', CCMe, 31:213-40, cites lit. and documentary sources to argue an early appearance of the couched-lance technique. Michel Stanesco, Jeux d'errance du chevalier medieval. Aspects ludiques de la fonction guerriere dans la litterature du moyen age flamboyant, Leiden, Brill, ix + 248 pp., gathers some very interesting material on dubbing ceremonial, tournament lit., chess, and festivities. C. W. Hollister, 'Courtly culture and courtly style in the Anglo-Norman world', Albion, 20:1-17, paints a picture of a post-Conquest court moving from tough upward mobility to soft longhaired degeneracy, before Henry I establishes a more literate court. R. Rohr, 'Die Schonheit des Menschen in der mittelalterlichen Dichtung Frankreichs', Stemmler, Schbne, pp. 89?107, points to the (rather obvious) links between Beauty/Good and Ugliness/Evil, and notes some standard description conventions. S. G. Nichols, 'Rewriting marriage in the Middle Ages', RR, 79:42-60, explains the paradox of woman's role, at once profane and religious. Darker</page><page sequence="2">Early Medieval Literature 45 ground is covered by D. Rieger, 'Le motif du viol dans la litterature de la France medievale entre norme courtoise et realite courtoise', CCMe, 31:241-67 (cf. K. Varty, YWMLS, 48:83): the idealized epic/romance picture of the damsel saved from ravishment is in conflict with the medieval anti-feminism reflected in other texts. The Writings of Medieval Women, ed./transl. Marcelle Thiebaux (GLML, B, 14), xviii + 250 pp., assembles a well-known company that includes Marie de France (as well as the trobairitz and Christine de Pizan). Margaret Hallissy, * Venomous Women. Fear of the Female in Literature, London, Greenwood, 192 pp., includes medieval examples of women as poisoners/givers of potions. D. Lett, 'L'enfance: aetas infirma, aetas infima\ Medievales, no. 15*85-95, sheds more light on the negative medieval view of the child: small and ugly, lacking the communicat ing power of speech. (See also Campbell and Taylor below, under Epics.) Felix Lecoy, Melanges de philologie et de litterature romanes, PRF, 81, 640 pp., is a variorum collection (companion to the 1984 Critique et Philologie), containing among many other pieces all L.'s revs of books on the Chanson de Roland, and including a 1971-84 updated 'Comple ment a la Bibliographie des Travaux de Felix Lecoy'. D. A. Trotter, Medieval French Literature and the Crusades (1100-1300) (HICL, 256), 280 pp., combines a timely analysis of the actual vocabulary of crusading with a detailed survey of the tradition of crusade lit. (epic, romance, lyric, didactic and satirical texts, drama), concluding that this tradition is largely independent of historical developments, and is not as ubiquitous as hitherto assumed. Two general introductions to the medieval use of myths are provided by L. Harf-Lancner, 'Le moyen age et la mythologie antique', Harf-Lancner, Mythologie, pp. 3-9, and by D. Boutet, 'Mythe, litterature et societe', ib., pp. 89?97. More specifically, J.-M. Boivin, 'Le mythe irlandais dans la litterature du moyen age', ib., pp. 137-54, shows a fostering of stereotypes of strange beasts, marvels, and skinclad natives: Ireland is seen as a borderland between Christendom and Barbary. J. Tattersall, 'Expedition, exploration and odyssey. Extended voyage themes and their treatment in some early French texts', Woledge Vol., pp. 191-214, notes a clinging to established beliefs and to an imagined world, with auctoritas more important than observation (only in the Roman d'Alexandre will some realistic description occur). J. Rychner, 'Messages et discours double', ib., pp. 145-61, analyses the pattern in both epic and romance of the staged transfer of vital messages: a shift from direct to indirect speech has the effect of involving both character and narrator. P. Haidu, 'Temps, histoire, subjectivite aux Xle et XIle siecles', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 105-22: in early OF texts key iconic figures assure the linking of past to present, often to the latter's detriment, until Chretien reworks the motif into the concept of</page><page sequence="3">46 French Studies 'new time', with new codes. P. Zumthor offers three more pieces in the field he has made so much his own: 'Les masques du chant. Le point de vue du philologue', Revue Musicate, 73, 1987:7-18, notes the stressing of vocality in medieval documents referring to the sung nature of a given text, reinforcing a similar stress given in romance narrative wherever a lyric insert is introduced; 'The vocalization of the text: the medieval "poetic effect"', Viator, 19:273-82, makes the further point that diction transforms all verse into chant, and that a text's structure may well reflect performance, not necessarily in strict formulaic terms, but rather as the poet judges his scenes for presentational effect; and 'Les masques du poeme. Questions de poetique medievale', Oilier, Masques, pp. 9-21, notes first how a disguised hero employs speech as well as appearance to conceal his identity, and then how on the wider poetic level a new genre will manipulate and transform an older language. A. Renoir, 'Oral formulaic rhetoric: an approach to image and message in medieval poetry', Finke and Shichtman, Texts, pp. 234-53, agrees that medi eval style depends upon a poet steeped in tradition: much non-epic verse inherits structures from the earlier form. M. Riffaterre, 'The mind's eye: memory and textuality', RR, 79:7-21, concentrates upon the similarity between oral and written, observing as a vital feature of a text's patterning those elements remembered by the reader, just as oral motifs echo in the ear. D. Maddox, 'Vers un modele de la communaute textuelle au moyen age', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, pp. 480? 90, follows Zumthor and Stock in analysing a text's production, dissemination and reception. Anne-Marie Genevois, Jean-Francois Genest and Anne Chalandon, Bibliotheques de manuscrits medievaux en France: releve des inventaires du VIHe au XVIHe siecle, CNRS, 1987, xx + 388 pp., most admirably show the practical nature of such disse mination, in an alphabetical original-owner listing, complete with classification-indexes providing further details of individual or insti tutional owners. Le Livre au moyen age, ed. Jean Glenisson, CNRS, 248 pp., is a superbly illustrated vol. of essays on all aspects of MSS and texts. Francois Gamier, L'Ane a la lyre. Sottisier dHconographie medievale, Le Leopard d'or, 204 pp., is an expert (and salutary) guide to the pitfalls of false or misleading interpretation, citing many examples involving 'classical' illus. to OF texts. D. F. Hult, 'Reading it right: the ideology of text editing', RR, 79:74-88, picks up the critical threads of'manuscript studies', restates the Lachmannian/ Bedierist approaches, appreciates Zumthorian mouvance-theory, and recommends variorum eds, with a base working MS faithfully surrounded by all other scribal 'performances'. 2. Epics Bulletin bibliographique de la Societe Rencesvals, Nizet, 201 pp., offers its usual prompt survey for 1987-88. L'Epopee, ed. Juan Victorio and</page><page sequence="4">Early Medieval Literature 47 Jean-Charles Payen, Turnhout, Brepols, 254 pp., is a compact analytical survey with sections of particular OF relevance by J.-M. Paquette, 'Definition de genre' (13-35), ?y F. Suard and J. Flori, 'La chanson de geste en France' (53-119) and by M. Tyssens, 'La tradition manuscrite et ses problemes' (229-50)^. S. Miletich notes analogous formulaic devices in 'Muslim oral epic and medieval epic', MLR, 83:911-24, Genevieve Madika, * Epopee et saintete. La religion dans les chansons de geste du XIHe siecle, Lille, Centre d'Etudes Medievales et Dialectales, Lille III. J.-P. Martin, 'Les offres de presents dans les chansons de geste: structures rhetoriques et conditions d'enonciation', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 183-207, ana lyses a remarkably stable formulaic unit, full of set rhythmical motifs. H. Legros, 'Les automates. Attirance, repulsion de l'etrange', Etrange, pp. 297-314: the (fairly rare) epic appearance of automata evokes the Eastern world, and to an extent reflects the realities of Byzantine mechanical tradition and Islamic technology; but essentially they are condemned symbols of an alien and idolatrous world. K. A. Campbell, 'Beware of biting child: childhood recaptured in the medieval legend of Boon and Olive", Olifant, 13:165-75, counters the commonplace assertion that the Middle Ages see children as 'miniature adults' by noting a few epic details of childhood reality: baby food, temper-tantrums, sibling rivalry, battered babies . . . S. M. Taylor, 'Comic incongruity in Medieval French Enfances", RoQ, 35:3_I05 sees the comic escapades of youthful characters as conscious 'previews' of the subsequent mighty deeds of mature heroism. roland and gharlemagne. Classical and Medieval Literature Criti cism, 1, ed. Dennis Poupard and Jelena O. Krstovic, Detroit, Gale Research Co., xii + 607 pp., includes a long section (160-267) on the Roland consisting of copious extracts from critical essays (but very few French, and little on basic structure or on orality). Michael Hecht, La Chanson de Turold: essai de dechiffrement de la Chanson de Roland, Bailly, 206 pp., is a cipher expert's ingenious study centred on numerology and rhythmical patterning, setting out from Rychnerian formulaic principles to show laisses existing in symmetrical blocks ranged before and after a number of keystone central laisses, around which all essential action moves. H. is confident that the Baligant episode is integral to the grand design of a text possessing a Romanesque architectonic pattern. S. Farrier, 'A linguistic dating of the Oxford Chanson de Roland and stylistic analysis of the resultant strata', Olifant, 13:3-27, puts forward a daring but well constructed hypothesis based on the distinguishable presence of three textual layers: an earliest fragment (10th c), a 'middle text' of the nth c, and a I2th-c. addition which builds up character psychology and the religious themes. All major figures and events appear in all the strata, again</page><page sequence="5">48 French Studies pointing to Baligant's incorporation at a very early date. R. G. Arthur, 'The Baligant episode in the Chanson de Roland and the Historia of Peter Tudebode', ib., pp. 177-80, notes that the Latin chronicle of the First Crusade contains a fictionalized episode very similar in structure to the Baligant scenes, and that the latter is at the very least no alien interpolation. L. Lofstedt, 'Sur la loi, la litterature et la culture de l'ancienne France', Neophilologica Fennica, 1987:256-65, cites legal documents to elucidate some of the most celebrated of epic scenes: defeated champions losing their right hands; glove-offering performed by family head dying without heir; lord's legal duty, where both intended husband and male kin-guardian are dead, to provide a lady with instant replacement . . . E. Ulrich, ' "Kollektive Aggres sion" in der Chanson de Roland und im Rolandslied des Pfaffen Konrad. Die Idee des Gottesfriedens als Legitimationsmodell fur Reconquista und welfische Expansionspolitik', Euphorion, 82:211-25: the zealous crusading spirit of the OF text is carried forward to colour the more secular political matter of later I2th-c. Germanic expansion Eastward. L. Peeters, 'Syntax and rhythm in the Song of Roland: evidence of a changing vision of the world', Proceedings . . . (Durban), pp. 35-43, hears the poet's voice moving the story towards eternal truths and divine symbols, in a transformation that has nothing to do with any shift from orality. H. Doerry, 'The technique of laisses similaires in the Ganelon?Marsile exchange of the Chanson de Roland', Chimeres, 19:7-26: drama conveyed as dialogue, with the language of the two protagonists being at once similar and yet contrasting. E. J. Mickel, 'Ganelon after Oxford', Olifant, 13:73-82, observes in the Chateauroux MS a more blatantly guilty and deceiving villain: but the Oxford text (more subtle, certainly) is no less condemnatory of Ganelon. J.-M. Paquette, 'Le temps dans la mbuvance du texte: analyse differentielle de la premiere laisse de la Chanson de Roland, d'apres les diverses versions', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 219-24: where Oxford gives an admirably taut and essential binary opposition, the later versions show varying degrees of entropy, with extraneous elements and lost balance. Id., 'Masque, songe et metaphore: le cas de la Chanson de Roland', Oilier, Masques, pp. 233-42, provides a basic analysis of the dream sequences that serve as epic substitutes for more rhetorical lit. devices. M. Houdeville studies 'Une arme etrange dans la Chanson de Roland?, Etrange, pp. 245-53: the Saracens are masters of disinformation, keeping the enemy confused, recruiting agents and concealing deception behind seeming reason. D. D. R. Owen surveys the dramatic use of gesture symbolism in 'Beards in the Chanson de Roland', FMLS, 24:175-79 (centring around Charlemagne and his emotions). Similar material is used by S. Vatteroni, Tl gesto del dolore e il gesto dell'offesa nella Chanson de Roland?, SMV, 31, 1985</page><page sequence="6">Early Medieval Literature 49 (1987): 191-203. P. Merci, 'Segnatura di due manoscritti rolandiani: una rettifica', MedRom, 13:181-82, corrects items of false codicologi cal information perpetrated by Bedier and perpetuated by all subsequent scholarship. M.-F. Notz, 'Le bestiaire fabuleux et l'imaginaire de la conquete dans la Chanson d'Aspremont", Etrange, pp. 315-27, cites various creatures of the devil opposing the knights' ascent of the mountain. P. Bancourt, 'Le visage de l'Autre: etude sur le sens de la Chanson d'Aspremonf, ib., pp. 45-56: the work is geared to boosting Western self-esteem for the Third Crusade (via admiring Saracen reactions). A. Brasseur, 'La part de Jehan Bodel dans la Chanson de Saisnes, ou quatre redactions en quete d'auteur?', Olifant, 13:83-95, sees tne hand of the poet up to v. 3307 (after then, the Arras flavour is lost, and the language is more i3th-c). R. Colliot, 'L'etrange et les belles etrangeres dans le Siege de Barbastre", Etrange, pp. 89-107, studies the dragon-figures that swarm through the text in dream or reality, and the magic exoticism of the various belles sarrasines. The Pilgrimage of Charlemagne (Le Pelerinage de Charlemagne), ed./transl. Glyn S. Burgess, with an introd. by Anne Elizabeth Cobby (GLML, A, 47), ix + 183 pp. (this text is found pp. 1-89, and is followed by Aucassin et Nicolette, see below), offers a very sensible parallel transl., and makes out an equally sensible case for the retention of the work's older traditional title. E. Vance, 'Semiotics and power: relics, icons and the Voyage de Charlemagne a Jerusalem et a Constantinople", RR, 79:164-83, concentrates upon historico-political events that colour the text (and are comically reduced by it); rivalry between Louis VII and Manuel Comnenus, Suger's authority, disastrous consequences of the Second Crusade, the division between the Eastern and Western Church over icons. guillaume d'orange and garin cycle. David P. Schenk, The Myth of Guillaume: poetic consciousness in the Guillaume d} Orange Cycle, Birming ham, AL, Summa, 144 pp., asserts the presence in the core texts of a clear message of the hero as civilizer, testifying to the different poets' shared consciousness. Guillaume's mission is underpinned by polar oppositions of maintenance and destruction conveyed by the mythic elements of nature, water, fire, and food; and his archetypal heroic activity goes beyond feudal/religious politics. J.-C. Aubailly, 'Guill aume d'Orange ou la quete de l'autre monde', Etrange, pp. 33-43, also sees the hero as Jungian archetype moving through his cycle towards individuation, confronting instruments of the Shadow in the persons of the Saracens. R. Lafont, 'Le mystere de l'Archamp', MedRom., 13:161-80, concentrates on more topographical matters, arguing that Archamp-sur-Mer is near Narbonne: subsequent epic and onomastic development shifts the site to Aries and to the Nimes/ Orange setting for the Chanson de Guillaume, in time for full epic deployment in the new political axis of the North.</page><page sequence="7">5? French Studies other epics. S. Roblin, 'L'enchanteur et le roi: d'un antagonisme politique a une rivalite mythique?', Harf-Lancner, Mythologie, pp. 117-36, takes another look at the ambivalent magic-making character (Auberon, Maugis, etc.) who stands in for the rebel-vassal in subversive confrontation with the king, and who may be traced back to Indo-European concepts of the 'disturber of the set order'. R. G. Koss, 'Raoul de Cambrai and inheritance disputes in feudal society', Olifant, 13:97-110, explains the delay in attempting to rectify Louis's unjust act of disseizin: under customary feudal law only the victim may proceed against a malefactor, and as a minor Raoul cannot yet present his own case. A. Leupin, 'Raoul de Cambrai: la batardise de l'ecriture', RR, 79:89-104, notes the textualization of chivalry into a rhetorical combat, and the echoing of the perpetuated feud by the continued poem (with the taking-over of one hand from the other carrying the matter into a new generation of poetic form). M. de Combarieu du Gres, 'De l'etrange au merveilleux ou le recours aux forets dans Renaut de Montauban\ Etrange, pp. 127-55, studies the potential for mystery in the text's three 'character' levels: beast (Bayard), man (Maugis) and place (the Ardennes). S. H. Cavanaugh, 'The identification of a lost English analogue of the "Death of Begun" episode from the Old French epic Garin le Loherain\ MAe, 57:64?67, argues convincingly that a hitherto unrecognized title in a ME library inventory represents a version of the bloody episode in Garin that advances the feud between Loherains and Fromonts. Gerbert: chanson de geste du XIHe siecle, transl. Bernard Guidot, Nancy U.P., 283 pp., contains a scholarly postface giving background details to Gerbert de Metz, a Loherain Cycle continuation that portrays many aspects of a society in crisis. Id. offers more material in 'Continuite et rupture: l'univers epique de Garin le Lorrain et Gerberf, Olifant, 13:123?40: although the clan-feud continues redoubled, the Gerbert poet allows a certain derision to creep in, as the younger heroes take over in a society where the old warriors are no longer blindly idolized. C. M.Jones, 'Dispersed parallelism in Hervis de Mes\ ib., pp. 29-40, observes an epic regeneration at work in this belated 'prologue' to the Loherains Cycle, with traditional parallel scenes now being dispersed through several laisses and hundreds of lines, in an increasingly complex pattern. P. Walter studies 'Geogra phic et geopolitique dans la legende oV Hervis de Metz\ ib., pp. 141-63, seeing in the precise refs to the rich and well defended city the suggestion of a Utopia partly reflecting Metz's own early i3th-c. emancipation from episcopal power. I. Weill, 'Outremer et outre monde dans Auberi le Bourgoing\ Etrange, pp. 481-93, studies attitudes towards the pagan enemy, here more clearly Germanic (interestingly, a later MS version proceeds to 'Saracenize' the text). H. Legros, 'Ami</page><page sequence="8">Early Medieval Literature 51 et Amile: compagnonnage epique et/ou amitie spirituelle', BDBA, 6:113-29, investigates the extent to which the friendship themes may be seen as cognate with the more classic epic motif of the fellow warrior, and suggests that the poet has employed convention to present a far more subtle and recondite theme (with its accent on exemplary suffering and sacrifice). F. Suard also considers the blend of genres, in 'Le merveilleux et le religieux dans Ami etAmile\ Etrange, pp. 449-62: here the poet is very conscious of the limits of compati bility between folkloric source-material and the Christian message. M.-R.Jung gives the text (27 vv.) of 'Un nouveau fragment de Gui de NanteuiV, VR, 46, 1987 (1988): 63-66, from MS Bale N16, Nr. 62. J. Subrenat, 'D'etranges machines etrangeres dans le cycle de Huon de Bordeaux: les automates, gardiens de Dunostre', Etrange, pp. 463-80, notes how an initial appearance in Huon calls for subsequent details of the origins of the striking automata to be provided in the additional texts. J. Baroin, 'Le fruit merveilleux d'Esclarmonde\ ib., pp. 57-70, also studies a Huon continuation, and the reconciliation motif of the gift of rejuvenating apples. Dominique Boutet, Jehan de Lanson. Technique et esthetique de la chanson de geste au XIHe siecle, Presses de l'Ecole Normale Superieure, 274 pp., studies the use of traditional epic features in a work of c. 1240 that does not move into Romance, but that does become more and more narrative, with far longer laisses, with a conscious polishing of the old form, and with greater ironic wit. The poet succeeds in producing something new from something old. 3. Romances Encomia, 10: 14-145, offers an 'International bibliography for 1966'. Georges Duby, Male Moyen Age. De Vamour et autres essais, Flammarion, 276 pp., collects important previously published pieces on love and marriage, 'courtly love' and its public, aristocratic family structures and medieval cultural values. L. Lofstedt, 'Hommage', NMi, 89:4-17, studies a key concept that is as courtly as it is feudal. An heiress had to be married before she could enter into her landed rights: her husband would pay the lord homage for her and her lands. 'Courtly homage' represents a neat cross-over adaptation into the world of Romance. Joan Ferrante, Self-Imprisonment of Man and Society in Courtly Codes, New Orleans, Tulane U. Graduate School, 1984, 26 pp., sees in courtly and chivalric conduct a lack of liberation: there is strong prison imagery in love and quest lit., and for all the man is the idealized captive of the woman, in reality the opposite is the case. Only self-awareness can break the chains. F. VVolfzettel, 'Wahrheit der Geschichte und Wahrheit der Frau: Honor de feme und</page><page sequence="9">52 French Studies weibliche aventure im altfranzosischen Roman', ZRF, 104:197-217, sets woman's role in varying socio-historical contexts, bound up with the revised attitudes towards marriage and the shift in perception of the status of the wife that took place inside and outside the Church in the years up to 1200. C. Marchello-Nizia, 'L'invention du dialogue amoureux: le masque d'une difference', Oilier, Masques, pp. 223-31, notes the very high proportion of direct speech in OF romances and its importance in building up the courtly symbol of the bonding of body and heart (even though the dialogue is often oblique). C. Segre, 'Perspectives des voix et perspectives de la vision dans les recherches sur le roman medieval'. Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 462-69, surveys modern critical approaches, with particular homage paid to Bakhtin; and a more specific review (on discourse-theory and on the authorial function) is offered by V. Bertolucci-Pizzorusso, ib., pp. 470-79. R. W. Hanning, "T shal finde it in a maner glose": versions of textual harassment in medieval literature', Finke and Shichtman, Texts, pp. 27-50, prefaces Chaucerian material with some i2th-c. OF examples (Marie de France, Hue de Rotelande, Gautier d'Arras, Chretien de Troyes) of authors reinterpreting their source-material for their own public's benefit. M. Stanesco, 'Nigromance et univer site: scolastique du merveilleux dans le roman francais du moyen age', Poirion, Milieux, pp. 129-44, points out refs in romances to scholars versed in the magical as well as the liberal arts: from being a pagan preserve, nigromance comes to be accepted as an apanage of superior clergie (indicating that the Church never totally succeeded in suppressing public approval of such practices). E. Baumgartner reviews 'Le temps des automates', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 15-21: in the Romans d'Antiquite such machines appear essentially as devices perpetuating in time the memory of a given character; only later do they take on negative connotations as diabolical obstacles to the hero's progress. D. Guerrero-Richard, 'Ou est done passee Blanche Neige?", Couleurs, pp. 119-40, traces elements of this classical folk legend into OF lit., particularly in the tale's potential for colour symbolism and repressed sexuality. matiere de bretagne. BBSIA, 38, 383 pp., and 39, 407 pp., give 1986 and 1987 listings respectively. Quondam etFuturus, 8, ed. Mildred Leake Day, continues to provide its regular and swift coverage of the latest material in the field. Norris J. Lacy and Geoffrey Ashe, The Arthurian Handbook, NY, Garland, xxxii + 456 pp., offers excellent critical survey-chapters on all aspects of the legend (origins, medieval and modern lit., artistic representation) together with a sizeable glossary and bibliography. An Arthurian Reader. Selections from Arthurian Legend, Scholarship and Story, ed. John Matthews, Wellingborough, Aquarian Press, 352 pp., although in places an entertaining ragbag,</page><page sequence="10">Early Medieval Literature 53 does concentrate on clear fields of interest (Celtic sources, Grail quest, Arthurian imagination), combining OF material with 19th/ 20th-c. critical and cultural reactions. The Romance of Arthur, 111, ed. James J. Wilhelm, NY, Garland, viii + 268 pp., does not desert the OF domain, but widens the anthological boundaries to include some lesser-known Arthurian texts from other European traditions (cf. YWMLS, 46:57, and 48:65). G. Ashe, 'The convergence of Arthurian studies', Braswell and Bugge, Tradition, pp. 10-28, urges a sensible blending of the lit., folkloric, topographical, historical, archaeologi cal, and social, not so much to provide answers as to reveal the disparate nature of a legend born in a Latin Roman Britain that was the only self-governing Western province before the Barbarian invasions (and the only place where dramatic defence against these invasions was actually offered). J. Janssens, 'Koning Arthur en de Tafelronde. Didactische inleidung', ML, ser. 1, 16, 1987, pp. 1-102, gives a comprehensive Matiere de Bretagne survey, from Celtic to Anglo-Norman and so into wider courtly contexts. W. Van Hoecke, 'La litterature francaise d'inspiration arthurienne dans les anciens Pays-Bas', ib., pp. 189-260, analyses to excellent effect the role of patronage (with notable ref. to the Counts of Flanders and the Dukes of Brabant), providing a MS listing of OF and MF texts benefiting from this patronage. Linda M. Gowans, Cei and the Arthurian Legend (Arthurian Studies, 18), Cambridge, D. S. Brewer, x + 214 pp., affords us a fascinating study of degeneration and beyond: the Celtic epic war-hero Cei, witty but quick to take offence at mockery, becomes the Kes of OF romance ? at first noble enough, but then (his role contaminated by the 'bad senechal' motif, and his very name by low 'scullion' associations) he becomes increasingly unattractive, even abusive and criminal. Tadahiro Ikegami, *Gawain and the Arthurian Legend (in Japanese), Tokyo, Shuban International, 285 pp. R. Morris, 'Aspects of time and place in the French Arthurian verse romances', FS, 42:257-77, emphasizes the limitation of Arthur's realm: not merely geographically (Wales and the Scottish Borders), but in narrative terms of a select band of knights moving in closely interlocking quest-and-adventure circles. Claude Lecouteux, Les Nains et les elfes au moyen age, Imago, 216 pp., surveys (rather insubstantially) the medieval lit. traditions, the older myth-legends, and the later evolution and survival of associated motifs. E. Bozoky, 'Les masques de 1' "ennemi" et les faux chemins du GraaP, Oilier, Masques, pp. 85-95, reveals the presence of the 'masked Devil' in i3th-c. Grail Romance, either in tempting or seductive guise, or ? at the other extreme ? in a foul or menacing shape inspiring terror or horror. D. Trotter, 'La mythologie arthurienne et la predication de la croisade', Harf-Lancner, Mythologie, pp. 155-77, notes that Humbert</page><page sequence="11">54 French Studies de Romans's mid-13th-c. treatise De predicatione makes frequent ref. to lit. works such as the Pseudo-Turpin, the first Perceval Continuation, and above all the Vengeance Raguidel (an episode of which is duly given in resume, in the appropriate context of a call to arms). A similar case is studied by A. Moisan, 'Aubri de Trois-Fontaines et la "matiere de Bretagne'", CCMe, 31:37-42: as well as incorporating epic themes into his chronicle the Cistercian monk also, if more spasmodically, brings in Arthurian material (particularly items genealogical and prophetic). M. V. Guerin, 'The king's sin: the origins of the David-Arthur parallel', Baswell and Sharpe, Arthur, pp. 15-30, shows that, although explicit comparison is not made in OF texts, the episode of Arthur's incest with his sister is clearly analogous to that of David's adultery; and the two kings are duly included in the later Neuf Preux pantheon (as Charlemagne was called 'the new David', a similar association with Arthur would not be unexpected). Chretien de troyes. L. Rossi, 'Chretien de Troyes e i trovatori: Tristan, Linhaura, Carestia', VR, 46, 1987 (1988): 26-62, analyses the interdependence of Chretien, Raimbaut d'Orange, and Bernart de Ventadorn in a three-way debate on love and its symbols, each poet responding and riposting to the other. H. C. R. Laurie, 'The Letters of Abelard and Heloise: a source for Chretien de Troyes?', SM, 27, 1986 (1987): 123-46, suggests that the poet may have had access to a copy of the correspondence (which would thus have been in circulation much earlier than hitherto assumed), and that he echoes the letters in D Amors qui m'a tolu a moi, in Erec and in Cliges. J. D. Janssens, 'The influence of Chretien de Troyes on Middle Dutch Arthurian Romances: a new approach', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 285-306, advances the Prose Cycle as mediating agent. W. R. J. Barron, 'Chretien and the Gawain-poet: master and pupil, or twin temperaments?', ib., pp. 255-84, perceives striking similarities, rooted in a common concept of romance celebrating the ideal and yet acknowledging the restraints of reality and of human frailties. The poet's rhetorical technique is studied by Katalin Halasz, *A pdrviadal: elbeszeles is szerkezet Chretien de Troyes regenyeiben, Budapest, Akademiai Kiado, 145 pp. A. Eskenazi, 'Eglise et mostier dans les romans de Chretien de Troyes (BN. 794)', RLiR, 52:121-38, notes the poet's subtle ability to distinguish in his narrative between holy office celebrated by the clergy, and scenes of practical ceremonial attended by the laity. In an important article, E. Schulze-Busacker, 'Philomena. Une revision de l'attribution de l'ceuvre', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988) '.459-85, points out that this short text contains many proverbial expressions also found in Chretien's romances: stylis tically, the grounds seem firm for a positive attribution oiPhilomena as the poet's earliest extant work (c. 1165-70). N. Thomas, 'Gereint and</page><page sequence="12">Early Medieval Literature 55 Erec ? a Welsh heroic text and its Continental successors', Trivium, 22, 1987:37-48, puts forward the case that Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia, a terminus a quo for Chretien's romance, is also the terminus ante quern for the original Gereint (a basic story of primitive passion, transformed by the OF poem). J. A. Nelson offers 'A Jungian interpretation of sexually ambiguous imagery in Chretien's Erec et Enide", Braswell and Bugge, Tradition, pp. 75-89, concentrating on the four animals (two from the world of the hunt: white stag and sparrowhawk; two from Bestiary tradition: goat and leopard) that express the characters' emotional states, while combining male/ female and active/passive aspects which increase the chiasmic nature of the work. A larger beast-count is studied by D. Nelson, 'The role of animals in Erec et Enide', RoQ, 35:31-38: the various creatures (45 in all) add comparative humour, stress luxury and status, and deter mine the atmosphere and senefiance of a given episode. J. Brumlik, 'Chretien's Enide: wife, mistress and metaphor', ib., 401-14, posits a gulf between hero and heroine: far from testing Enide, Erec is less worthily trying to destroy woman-as-wife in his attempt to restore his concept of the amie ... A. Dees, 'Analyse par l'ordinateur de la tradition manuscrite de Cliges de Chretien de Troyes', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 62-75, argues for a widening of the traditional view of vertical stemmata. Y. Ferroul, 'Propedeutique a une lecture du prologue de Cliges', BDBA, 5, 1987: 57-71, analyses Chretien's use of four rhetorical motifs drawn from the Classical prologue-tradition: the captatio benevolentiae, the summary, the assurance of a worthwhile subject, the citing of worthwhile characters (he wishes to make his text an acceptable repository of the auctoritas that he has uncovered and is reworking). C. J. Chase, 'Double bound: secret sharers in Cliges and the Lancelot-Grail', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 169-85, comments on character mirror-images, with their attendant mythic associations of twinhood and pairing. H. Bayer,' "Vita cum Phoenice complice". Gottfried von Strassburg's "gotinne" Isolde, Chretien's Fenice and neo-Platonic mysticism in Alsace and Troyes', OL, 43:20-31, advances the theory that Chretien was involved in the persecution of a local mystical heresy, and that in Cliges, his 'Anti-Tristan', honour and constancy confront neo-Platonism's demon sexuality and false regeneration-concepts (on the other side, Gottfried may have been inclined towards these heretical beliefs, and been expelled for his pains). D. McGrady, 'The hunter loses his falcon: notes on a motif from Cliges to La Celestina and Lope de Vega', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 145-82, discusses the hawk as male erotic symbol, and Chretien's influence on later medieval Hispanic lit. R. L. Krueger, 'Desire, meaning and the female reader: the problem in Chretien's Charrete", Baswell and Sharpe, Arthur, pp. 31-51, laments</page><page sequence="13">56 French Studies the practical powerlessness of women: Guenievre's seeming imposi tion of authority over Lancelot is in fact turned against her, serving but to advance masculine desire; while there are other links between woman's power and sexual peril, feeding male fears and fantasies. P. Raabe, 'Chretien's Lancelot and the sublimity of adultery', UTQ, 57:259-69, studies the case of the 'praised sinner', the hero whose love actually uplifts him because it enables him to keep faith on multiple levels (as opposed to Meleagant, symbol of bad faith). D. F. Hult analyses 'Lancelot's shame', RPh, 42:30-50, noting the fre quency in the Charrete of the word honte: it is still an objectivized social attribution, with connotations of disgrace or physical dishonour that must be redeemed vigorously (but the variants in later MSS may show a desire to convey the more modern concept). M.-H. Moya examines 'Les couleurs dans la structure narrative du Lancelot', Couleurs, pp. 273-83, seeing red as notably ambivalent. S. Botterill, 'Re-reading Lancelot: Dante, Chaucer and Le Chevalier de la Charrette', PQ, 67:279-89, establishes links between the gruesome fate of Ugolino, the Monk's Tale and Lancelot's incarceration by Meleagant. Le Chevalier au lion de Chretien de Troyes: approches d'un chef-d'oeuvre, ed. Jean Dufournet, Champion, 220 pp., contains a number of pieces (distributed below under the abbrev.: Dufournet, Lion). Chretien de Troyes, Yvain, le chevalier au lion, transl. Claude-Alain Chevallier, LGF 286 pp., includes a useful preface and a substantial commentary on the text. On a far higher level is Brian Woledge, Commentaire sur Yvain (Le Chevalier au Lion) de Chretien de Troyes, 1.11: vv. 3412-6808 (PRF, 186), xiv + 182 pp., who here completes his work begun in 1986 (see YWMLS, 48:68), with unfailing precision and erudition: his notes combine textual observations on the Guiot MS with linguistic points and wider cultural and lit. refs to Chretien's work and to OF and medieval Romance in general. Joan Tasker Grimbert, 'Yvain' dans le miroir: une poetique de la reflexion dans le cChevalier au lion' de Chretien de Troyes (PUMRL, 25), xii + 226 pp., argues that the poet is constantly putting into question the work's key images, without proposing any resolution since ambiguity is the text's crucial element. Thus the plot's linear progression is jolted by confrontations and uncertainties; perpetual binary opposition of motifs and correspondences estab lishes a strong polarization (particularly between joie and duel); and language too is ambivalent, with oxymorons and maxims repeated in the text with extra sense-layers, adding to Yvain's task of comprehen sion as (with growing perspicacity) he tackles all the ambiguities confronting him. B. N. Sargent-Baur, 'With catlike tread: the beginning of Chretien's Chevalier au Lion', Woledge Vol., pp. 163-73, notes the tentative, seemingly directionless opening section, with the true protagonists emerging only later: the whole reflecting the theme</page><page sequence="14">Early Medieval Literature 57 of the loss and regaining of role/identity. Z. P. Zaddy, 'Yvain as the ideal courtly lover', ib., pp. 253-75, insists that the hero is an exemplary figure in moral and social terms, free of the vices that have been ascribed to him (his main defect proves to be his impulsiveness). Philippe Walter, Canicule: essai de mythologie sur 'Yvain' de Chretien de Troyes, SEDES, 348 pp., adopts an intriguing 'Golden Bough' approach, in a comprehensive analysis of the work's Indo-European folk-myth content: patterns and punctuations of time; legends of the Holy Magician and of the Wild Man; Neptunian myths of oracular fountains and storm-making or healing waters; and above all the Lion-figure, associated zodiacally with Sirian madness, with Summer festivals, with Herculean feats, and with royal emblems. Id. abstracts the first portion of this study in 'Temps romanesque et temps mythique: elements pour une recherche', Dufournet, Lion, pp. 195 217. H. C. R. Laurie, 'Beasts and saints: a key to the lion in Chretien's Yvain", BBSIA, 39, 1987 (1988): 297-306, focuses upon the beast's Christological significance in the context of the message of regene ration, and upon the influence on the poet of the legends of Saints Jerome and Paul and of the Bestiary tradition. M. Stanesco, 'Le lion du chevalier: de la strategie romanesque a l'embleme poetique', Litteratures, no. 19:13-35, also enters the field of leonine iconography, tracing the narrative theme of the Grateful Beast from Androcles to Chretien's key concept of compagnonnage, a man/beast relationship raised to a super-spirituality that the medieval mind will work out in emblems of chivalry (the essay will be concluded in no. 20, 1989). A similar article is offered by J. Dufournet, 'Le lion d'Yvain', Dufour net, Lion, pp. 77?104, tracing the network binding the hero's beast to the worlds of art, heraldry, symbolism, and allegory. P. Menard, 'Rires et sourires dans le Chevalier au Lion', ib., pp. 7-29, sees the comic element deftly bound into the love-theme by a detached narrator very aware of paradoxes and comportments. E. Baumgartner notes that 'La fontaine au pin', ib., pp. 31-46, does not really attract the attention of the hero, who is destined to win the actual lady whom the glittering fountain but symbolizes. F. Dubost, 'Merveilleux et fantastique dans le Chevalier au lion', ib., pp. 47-76, agrees that Chretien is moving on, from the taste for the merveilleux for its own sake, into realms of irony and echoes of reality. D. Kelly, 'Lejeu de la verite', ib., pp. 105-17: the art of extracting and imposing truth calls for logic and rhetoric, and Lunete's skills come straight from the Trivium (while Laudine, her fellow-player, provides the necessary contrasting emotion). B. Marache, 'Le mot et la notion d'adventure dans la "conjointure" et le "sen" du Chevalier au lion', ib., pp. 119-38, observes each test as a mirror on the past and a model for the future, making Yvain Chretien's ideal Arthurian hero (prior to the creation</page><page sequence="15">58 French Studies of the initiatory figure of Perceval that shows the limitations of such an ideal). M. Santucci, 'La folie dans le Chevalier au lion', ib., pp. 153-72: an omnipresent state occasioned either by love or by tragic grief, representing a lack of essential sagesse, and operating expertly on the three social, symbolic, and literary levels of marginali zation, death-substitute, and structural metaphor. J. Ribard, 'Yvain et Gauvain dans le Chevalier au lion. Essai d'interpretation symbo lique', ib., pp. 139-52, sees behind the two knights the essential New Law/Old Law message, with Yvain taking on more and more the attributes of a miles Christi (his mission to the Chateau de Pesme Aventure being a new Harrowing of Hell). This last point is contradicted by J. Subrenat, 'Pourquoi Yvain et son lion ont-ils affronte les fils du netun?', ib., pp. 173-93: the castle cannot be hell, since there is a chapel there ... It has rather been possessed by demonic powers, and the true relevance of the episode is to mark the moment when Yvain regains his full status as a knight-champion. T. Hunt, '"Texte" and "pretexte": Jaufre and Yvain', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 125-41, agrees that Chretien's romance seems to be used by the Occitan author, but admits it possible that the two works are concurrent, and even just feasible that Chretien is delivering a tautly economical ripost to the prolixity of the Southern romance. The first fasc. of Pris-MA, 3, Poitiers, ERLIMA, 1987 (1988), 78 pp., is given over to research papers on Yvain, including J.-C. Aubailly on Jungian myth analysis (3?13), R. Colliot on prison imagery (23?31), P. Gallais on the structural application of the logical hexagon (33-46), J.-C. Lozac'hmeur on Arthurian archetypes (61-66), and P. Walter on ogre legends (67?78). Chretien, Guillaume d'Angleterre, ed. A. J. Holden (TLF, 360), 240 pp., is an impeccably neat and restrained ed. (from the C-text) that cuts the Gordian Knot of attribution by admitting the impossibility of establishing beyond reasonable doubt whether the great Champagne poet is in fact the author: hence the recourse to the 'Christian name' that remains the one onomastic certainty ... Id., 'La geographie de Guillaume d'Angleterre', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 124-29, also speedily flushes the Anglo-Norman hare of suggested Lovel patronage: there are no dedicatory verses, and the text is no Ancestral Romance but a Continental work, composed for a Continental public and containing clearly banal and conventional insular topography. K. Busby, 'The illustrated manuscripts of Chretien's Perceval', ZFSL, 98:41-52, sees in the paucity of illustrations to the poet's works an implication that these poems were read out aloud to family groups, while the often lavishly-illustrated prose texts had a wider visual deployment and appeal. But at least the illustrations to the Conte du graal do indicate the key episodes in the public's mind. H. C. R. Laurie, 'Chretien at</page><page sequence="16">Early Medieval Literature 59 work on the Conte du graal', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 38-54, analyses areas of the poet's debt to Classical sources (notably to Virgil and Lucan), which he reworks as skilfully as he does Celtic motifs. H. Lange, 'Symbolisme, exegese, litterature profane: intertextualite et intratextualite dans le Conte dugraal de Chretien de Troyes', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 289-307, concentrates on the Prologue's celebrated extended image of the Parable of the Sower: the text's opening sequence contains in germination all the narrative elements which will go to make up the whole romance. D. Kelly, 'Le lieu du temps, le temps du lieu', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 123-26, describes how Chretien uses the standard topical conventions of hie et nunc to form a narrative grid, in which his characters' chronology stands in relation to the Canonical Hours and to the great Christian feastdays. M. Vauthier, 'Le paradoxe des fenetres colorees dans le Conte du graal, une introduction possible a la lecture des couleurs chez Chretien de Troyes', Couleurs, pp. 423-48, studies symbols of the Divine Temple, and the possible influence of Hildegard of Bingen's visions of the Heavenly Jerusalem. E. J. Burns, 'Quest and questioning in the Conte du graal\ RPh, 41:251-66, brings out the full paradox of Perceval's dilemma: while the adept knight must know how to make deft use of speech, silence is an essential feature of spiritual development. The tension between chivalry and religiosity has no resolution (any more than does the romance itself). A. Groos, 'Perceval and Parzival discover knighthood', Kaske Vol., pp. 117-37, raises a i2th-c. beha vioural question: what happens when a noble youth raised away from all courtly society finally comes into contact with that society? For Chretien it is all a representation of norreture, of social development (while Wolfram will look more at his hero's inborn ability). S. Kinoshita, 'Les echecs de Gauvain ou l'utopie manquee', Litterature, no. 71:108-19, applies binary-composition analysis to the 'Gauvain' section of the Conte du graal: the hero's hitherto applauded and successful individuality is now seen in negative terms, as a tension between him and the community. All is unstable, achievements in the first part of the romance will be put in question in the second, as Chretien shows up the impossibility of the courtly world. other Arthurian romanges. K. Busby, 'William Roach's Contin uations of Perceval', RPh, 41:298-309, looks back at the now complete run of eds, and reviews critical attitudes towards the texts (regretting the lack of response). As if in answer comes Pierre Gallais, LLmagi naire d'un romancier franqais de la fin du XHe siecle. Description de la 'Continuation Gauvain \ Amsterdam, Rodopi, 3 vols, lxxviii + 1974 pp. (a fourth and final vol. will appear in 1989). This is less a critical study than something resembling a vast medieval Speculum, with layer upon layer of gloss and improving commentary upon the</page><page sequence="17">6o French Studies First Perceval Continuation. G. first analyses each episode, comparing short and long versions and other variants, before moving to an analysis of the work of the various copyists (MS-filiation; 'jongleu resque', lit. and learned redactions; interpolations and repetitions). There then follows a section on versification, followed in turn by a study of the poet: authorial interventions and personality, sources, relationship between work and intended public. The text is now ready for detailed evaluation (on Jungian and other principles): the vocabulary of action and situation; concepts of brightness, greatness, beauty; numbers and number-symbolism; substances, creatures, and characters (with particular attention to the key elemental nouns del, air, soldi, jour I nuit, feu). Realistic, symbolic, metaphysical and illumin ist descriptions are exhaustively catalogued. J. L. Grigsby, 'Rem nants of Chretien's aesthetics in the early Perceval Continuations, and the incipient triumph of writing', RPh, 41:379-93? describes an evolution towards a chirographic concept of romance, with disci plined unity being sought in place of the tension and suspense that belong to oral tradition; although textual length will increase to meet the requirements of clients able to afford a costly MS. Id. also looks at 'Heroes and their destinies in the Continuations of Chretien's Perceval', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 41-53: the Continuators fail to match Chretien's psychological subtlety and vision, but each makes some progress in certain areas (with Manessier at least achieving a conclusion). M. Zink, 'Vieillesse de Perceval: l'ombre du temps', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 285-94, traces the hero's fate after the Grail Quest: he is doomed to age and decline in all the texts save the Perlesvaus, where he remains eternally young (while, ironically, all around him age). M. L. Meneghetti, 'Signification et fonction receptionnelle de YElucidation du Perceval', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 55-69, argues that this enigmatic pseudoprologue aims to reaffirm the prestige of King Arthur's Court, and reflects (prudently) the status of the mature Philippe-Auguste; in its dogmatic response it is also tinged with the new scholasticism. J.-C. Huchet, 'Le nom et l'image. De Chretien de Troyes a Robert de Boron', ib., pp. 1-16, comments on a process of translatio: the Estoire du Graal 'accomplishes' the task of the older Perceval, returning to source, giving full explanations and citing names. R. T. Pickens, 'Histoire et commen taire chez Chretien de Troyes et Robert de Boron: Robert de Boron et le livre de Philippe de Flandre', ib., pp. 17-39: as Chretien refers to the Latin text that Philippe has charged him to translate, so Robert, while gradually increasing his own personal voice and the sacred content of his story, also reveals his source (Merlin's book dictated to Blaise) in a possible oblique homage to Chretien de Troyes himself. G. Eckard, 'Le Graal discriminant, le Cor et le Revelateur des Nartes', Actes . . .</page><page sequence="18">Early Medieval Literature 61 (Trier), vi, 395-404, sees in Robert de Boron's Estoire traces of Scythian rites (designation of heroes worthy of drinking from a precious cup). E. J. Burns, '"La Voie de la Voix": the aesthetics of indirection in the Vulgate Cycle', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 151-67, notes the multiplicity of voices: the intertwining narrative itself, the various knights recounting their adventures (sometimes the same tale will be told by li contes and by a knight), the damsels serving as oral guides along the snaking path of the action. E. Baumgartner, 'Masques de l'ecrivain et masques de l'ecriture dans les proses du GraaP, Oilier, Masques, pp. 167-75, urges us to recognize as a trap a prose author's anonymity or pseudonymity: dominating all the simulacra of claimed sources is his own real composition. M. de Combarieu du Gres, 'Les couleurs dans le cycle du Lancelot-Graal', Couleurs, pp. 451-588, is an exhaustive itemization of categories: nature, faces, everyday life, names, heraldry, weapons, the Other world, heroes, and structural patterns (the white/black/red dominance here revealing the works' archaic style, at variance with the novelty of the prose format). A. Micha, 'Note sur le temps romanesque dans le Lancelot', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 195-99, com ments on temporal flexibility, with linear progression combining with lateraljumps and with stasis. Id.,' "Senifiance" de quelques epreuves dans le Lancelot', Woledge Vol., pp. 103-10, stresses the text's spiritual hierarchy (a similar chivalric ranking as in the Queste). E. Kennedy, 'The quest for identity and the importance of lineage in thirteenth century French prose romances', Harper-Bill and Harvey, Ideals, 11, 70?86, points out that the social message of the Lancelot is more that of highclass solidarity than of the advancement of poor aspirants. L. C. Brook, 'Some Old French nose-bleeds', FSB, no. 27:3-4, notes signs of distress in the Prose Cycle. E. Vance, 'Le temps sans nombre: futurite et predestination dans la Queste del saint graal', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 273-83: the text's Cistercian spirituality has St Bernard's three categories of human powers embodied in the characters of Boort, Perceval, and Galaad. C. Mela, 'Life in La Mort le roi Artu', Baswell and Sharpe, Arthur, pp. 5-14, insists on the paradoxical presence in this text of much vital imagery and symbolism. F. Bogdanow, 'La chute du royaume d'Arthur. Evolution du theme', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 504-19, is an expanded revision of an 1984 English piece on the Mort Artu (see YWMLS, 46:57). M. A. Stones, 'Aspects of Arthur's death in medieval illumination', Baswell and Sharpe, Arthur, pp. 52-101, gives a MS-listing and an iconographical analysis of the portrayal of the Mort Artu's key motifs (Gauvain's warning, the battle against Mordret, the Sword and the Lake; the Tomb, sign of finality, is almost never illustrated). M. L. Meneghetti, 'Palazzi sotterranei, amori proibiti', MedRom, 12, 1987:443-58,</page><page sequence="19">62 French Studies assembles round the Huth Merlin episode of the wizard's underground entrapment a thematic grouping of other texts (notably, Thomas's Tristan, and Guiron le Courtois). L. Harf-Lancner and M.-N. Polino, 'Le gouffre de Satalie: survivances medievales du my the de Meduse', MA, 94:73-101, trace a necrophiliac tale into Western legend and so into the Livre d'Artus completion of the Prose Cycle. H. F. Williams raises 'The authorship of two Arthurian romances', FR, 61:163-69, agreeing with most scholars that the name of the author of the Mule sans frein is indeed 'Paien', and that the Chevalier a Vepee is an anonymous work. R. Blumenfeld-Kosinski, 'Arthurian heroes and convention: Meraugis de Portlesguez and Durmart le Gallois', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 79-92, shows later poets commenting on Chretien's world (and subtly subverting it) through the behaviour of their characters. M. Perret, 'Atemporalites et effet de fiction dans Le Bel Inconnu*, Hommage Zumthor, pp. 225-35, notes subtext and the distortion set up by the narrator's own appearance in his romance. V. Guerin, 'Les masques du desir et la hantise du passe dans Le Bel Inconnu', Oilier, Masques, pp. 55-63, concentrates on the incognito theme, seeing in it much ambiguous sexual imagery and identifica tion. N. J. Lacy denotes in 'The character of Gauvain in Hunbauf, BBSIA, 38, 1986 (1988): 298-305, not the essentially static personal ity found in almost all other Arthurian texts, but a growing upholder of virtue and honesty. F. Dubost describes 'Les couleurs heraldiques dans le Perlesvaus', Couleurs, pp. 71-85: the author shows a clear awareness of established rules. D. Chasse, 'Le deplacement du masque de l'autorite dans le Perlesvaus: le role de Josephe', Oilier, Masques, pp. 177-84, shows the author hiding behind a pseudo composer and scribe whose name echoes those of some of the text's characters (and who is actually cited by one of them as the author). A. Adams, 'The Roman d'Yder: the individual and society', Lacy, Kelly and Busby, Legacy, 11, 71-77: the hero's decision to quit the Round Table to rejoin his family serves as the final highlight to the work's extraordinary treatment of Arthur as rogue and villain. tristan. W. A. Trindade completes her study of 'The Celtic connections of the Tristan story', RMS, 13, 1987 (1988): 71-82 (see YWMLS, 49:554), by noting how OF and Anglo-Norman poets could have had early access to the Irish lit. tradition. A. de Mandach, 'Midas et Marc: le my the de deux souverains aux oreilles inavoua bles', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 104-26, explains the surfacing in Beroul of the Asses' Ears legend transferred from Asia Minor. A. Cazenave, 'Yseut et Heloise, ou la passion et Pamour', ib., pp. 87-96, draws a close analogy, valid whether the celebrated Letters be genuine or fabricated. J.-G. Gouttebroze, 'Tristan ou l'inceste impose', ib., pp. 127-38, points to medieval kinship prohibitions: the</page><page sequence="20">Early Medieval Literature 63 later texts treat the incest theme less indulgently than does Beroul, echoing a change in aristocratic attitudes. A. Adams looks again at the thematic tensions inherent in the anti/neo-Tristan spirit, in 'The Old French Tristan poems and the tradition of verse romance', Tristania, 12, 1986-87 (1988): 60-68. D. Kelly, 'La verite tristanienne: quelques points de repere dans les romans', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 168?80, sees the legacy of Tristan as a storehouse of themes and ideas ripe for renewal and re-evaluation. C. Martineau-Genieys, 'De Lancelot a Tristan, ou plutot d'lseut aux Blanches Mains a la demoiselle entreprenante: la preuve par la chair', ib., pp. 252-61, analyses Chretien's reworking (in the Charrete) of the chaste-marriage motif. M. R. Blakeslee collates 'Les allusions aux romans de Tristan dans l'oeuvre de Jean Renart: etude des sources', ib., pp. 42-58, concluding that the later poet draws all his refs from the extant canon. A. Ponti, T Tristani di Thomas e Beroul: prospettivismo monologico e prospettivismo dialogico', MedRom, 13:183-202, suggests that Beroul offers a more polyphonic combination of author, narrator, and characters than does the more smoothly tonal Thomas. E. Ruhe notes the medievalism of a modern text, 'Tristan et Iseut dans l'espace: a propos d'un poeme de Pierre Gamier', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 352 77; and J.-M. Paquette adds cinematographic evidence as 'La derniere metamorphose de Tristan: Yvan Lagrange (1972)', ib., pp. 319-25. Beroul, Tristan et Iseut, ed. Herman Braet and Guy Raynaud de Lage, Leuven, Peeters, 2 vols, 263 + 208 pp.: the first vol. contains the text with modern transl., the second notes and critical commentaries. S. Gregory too provides 'Further notes on the text of Beroul's Tristan', FS, 42:1-20, 129-49 (see ^so YWMLS, 43:63); more helpful readings are offered by A. Henry, 'Pour le commentaire du Tristan de Beroul', Woledge Vol., pp. 59-65; and M. R. Blakeslee and G. S. Burgess concentrate on 'Dagres, d'Acre, degiez: note sur le vers 3849 du Tristran de Beroul', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 536-40, reinforcing objections to a reading that would suggest a ref. to the Third Crusade. Two pieces from B. N. Sargent-Baur: in 'La dimension morale dans le Roman de Tristan de Beroul', CCMe, 31:49-56, she argues that nothing in an essentially amoral text supports a Christian or otherwise ethical message; and in 'Beroul's Tristran and the praise ofFolie', BBSIA, 38, 1986 (1988): 289-97, she declares the lovers to be conscious subversives, the vital 'madness' being an all-for-love emotional state that threatens the very tenets of society. J. Chocheyras, 'Sur le mariage d'lseut dans Beroul', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 97-103, sees the dramatic essence to be the clash between pagan magic and i2th-c. marriage ritual. J.

M.-L. Oilier, 'Le statut de la verite et du mensonge dans le Tristan de BerouP, ib., pp. 298-318: a medieval preoccupation is rendered opaque in the text, with the true and the false shifting according to a given standpoint. A. Kellogg notes that 'Comic scriptural allusions in BerouPs Tristran", Kaske Vol., pp. 85-99, serve to illuminate a character, deflate a melodramatic scene or subtly denounce institutions. J.-C. Huchet, 'Le mythe du Tristan primitif et les Folies Tristan', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 139-50, speaks out firmly against Urtext-theory. J. Kjaer, 'Le deguisement dans les Folies Tristan et la mort chez Thomas d'Angleterre', Oilier, Masques, pp. 65-73, detects coded refs to Jonah, and to the hero as scapegoat or sacrificial victim. A. Berthelot, 'L'inflation rhetorique dans le Tristan en prose', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 32-41: messages and lyrical compo sitions take the place of love observed in action. R. L. Curtis, 'A romance within a romance: the place of the "Roman du Vallet a la Cote Maltaillee" in the Prose Tristan', Woledge Vol., pp. 17-35, queries the effectiveness of this long and enigmatic interpolation (underlined by important MSS variations that seek ways of integrating it into the whole). However, J. P. Traxler, 'An analysis of Brunor in the Prose Tristan', Tristania, 12, 1986-87 (1988): 1-13, takes an opposing view of this episode, seeing in it a coherent insert, and in its hero not a failure but a wholly admirable knight showing up Tristan's own superfici ality. E. Baumgartner, 'Rois et chevaliers: du Lancelot en prose au Tristan en prose', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 19-31: the later text intro duces the political theme of the weak king, enemy to his knights. F. Bogdanow, 'Un nouveau temoin de la Queste Post-Vulgate: version du Tristan en prose (Bibliotheque Bodmer, MS 147)', ib., pp. 59-74, compares a fragmentary text with other MSS and declares it to represent an earlier stage of the Post-Vulgate than material preserved elsewhere. K. Gravdal, 'Fragmentation and imagination in the Old French Tristan: Marie de France's Lai du ChievrefoW, Tristania, 12, 1986-87 (1988): 69-78, speaks plausibly against the charge of fragmentation: Marie demands that her audience create a coherent design from her deliberately scattered shards, just as does Beroul in his mixed introd., and as Thomas may well have done by skimming over the early episodes which are usually taken to be lost from his text. D. Rocher, 'Marie de France et Pamour tristanesque', Buschinger, Tristan, pp. 341-51, traces further echoes in other lais besides Chevrefeuille. lais. Marie de France, (Euvres completes, ed.

Paupert-Bouchez, 'Blanc, rouge, or et vert: les couleurs de la merveille dans les Lais', Couleurs, pp. 301-28, collates all refs, noting that Marie's use of colours may be restricted, but that the symbolism is clear and standard. E. J. Benkov, 'The naked beast: clothing and humanity in Bisclavret', Chimeres, 19:27-43: Marie uses dress and undressing as metaphors for the various layers of her text (action is cloaked in secrecy, identity is uncovered). S. B. North studies 'The role of advice in Marie de France's Eliduc', Woledge Vol., pp. 111-33, noting the key medieval message that there is good and bad counsel: Eliduc will vainly seek advice until he realizes the true disinterested counsellor in the person of his wife Guildeluec, Marie's selfless heroine. J. Brumlik, 'Thematic irony in Marie de France's Guigemaf', FrF, 13:5-16, sees Marie playing social games with us, by offering us motifs which we recognize as leading normally to a 'happy marriage': but no marriage ever actually materializes. More ludic irony in R. H. Bloch, 'The medieval text ? Guigemar ? as a provocation to the discipline of medieval studies', RR, 79:63-73: by creating her text, which informs us via layers of keywords, Marie is effectively transmitting and destroying her lovers' secrets. D. Billy, 'Pour une structure semasiologique de "lai". Fondements et consequences', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 161-75, studies formulae, establishing groupings around main sememes of melody, song, and narrative. R. Middleton, 'Ten kings in the Lai du Cor', FSB, no. 29:15-18, picks up a scribal error and restores a detail of textual continuity. other courtly narrative. Aime Petit, L'Anachronisme dans les romans antiques du XIIe siecle, Lille, Centre d'Etudes Medievales et Dialectales de Lille III, 1985, 374 pp., is an excellently ordered thesis turned into a wide-ranging book that covers the anachronisms of warfare, feudal structures, religion, science and culture, social realism, and historico-political background, while also indicating those areas of Antiquity that the texts do consciously preserve (if duly translated). F. Mora-Lebrun, 'Gautier de Chatillon, Bernard Syl vestre et le Roman d'Eneas: trois tentatives d'appropriation de la mythologie antique au XIIe siecle', Harf-Lancner, Mythologie, pp. 11-26, compares three Virgilians: a conservative renewing of the original, a neo-Platonic mythological re-evaluation, and a poetic reduction of mythology to serve the novel love-theme. L Kasten, 'Herrschaft und Liebe: zur Rolle und Darstellung des "Helden" im Roman d'Eneas und in Veldekes Eneasroman', DVLG, 62:227-45, notes contradictions in the portrait of the hero as bearer of an ancient ethos of nobility, the very validity of which is called into question by love.

R. J. Cormier, 'La blessure d'Enee et la purification initiatique du heros', BDBA, 5, 1987:47-55, compares the effect of an arrow-wound in Latin and in OF: the medieval text invests the healing with magic, and also opens up the symbolic love-wound that is such a ritual for romance and beyond. RZLG, 12 :197-226, contains a number of abstract-articles based on papers read at a 1987 Gottingen Colloquium on the Roman de Thebes, and a full study (226-41) by M. Heintze on 'La reception des plus anciens troubadours dans le Roman de Thebes'. D. Rieger, ' "Aufgehobene" Genera: Gattungszitate und Gattungsinstrate im altfranzosischen Thebenroman', VR, 46, 1987 (1988) 167-86, warns against the tempta tion to see too many courtly elements in this early text. A. Petit, '"Mieus vaut lor ris et lor baisiers/que ne fait Londres ne Poitiers." Tradition manuscrit et critique litteraire: notes sur le Roman de Thebes et Cliges', BDBA, 5, 1987:123-28, suggests a pre-1153 dating for Thebes. F. Dubost studies radically different concepts of the Centaur in 'L'autre guerrier: l'archer-cheval. Du sagittaire du Roman de Troie aux sagittaires de la Mort Aymeri de Narbonne", Etrange, pp. 171-88. BDBA, 6, is mainly devoted to the Roman d'Alexandre, with pieces by E. Baumgartner on Eastern colour (7-15), R. Berger on MSS fragments (17-24), M. Gosman on the text's evolution (25-44) and A. Petit on the description of Alexander's tent (77-96); Id. also provides a good bibliographical supplement (97-110). M. Gosman turns also to 'Le Roman de Toute Chevalerie et le public vise: la legende au service de la royaute', Neophilologus, 72:335-43, pointing out Thomas of Kent's task: to make his disparate material relevant to Anglo-Norman society, setting at the apex Henry II, his Alexander . . .

Gicquel, 'Chronolo gic et composition de Balaham et Josaphas de Gui de Cambrai', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 113-23, posits a very early dating (to the 1190s), as well as a moralizing intent. F. Carmona Fernandez, 'El motivo del "don contraignant" en la narrativa en verso de los siglos XII y XIII', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 427-36, hails Jehan Renart as its most skilled later exponent. B. Van den Abeele, 'L'escoufle: portrait litteraire d'un oiseau', Reinardus, 1:5-15, compares many lit. refs (notably Jehan Renart) with the negative Bestiary portrait of the kite. W. C.

On the current dating-debate of Philippe's works she reserves judgement. C. deploys some of her material in collaboration with J. Dufournet, 'Temps liturgique et temps folkorique dans la Manekine de Philippe de Beaumanoir', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 63-72. W. W.

Mason, 'Fact and fiction in the English crusading tradition: the earls of Warwick in the twelfth century', JMH, 14:81-95, adduces historical evidence to go some way back to supporting the old Ancestral Romance definition of Gui de Warewic: some episodes seem based on real-life crusading exploits. Joufroi de Poitiers, transl. Roger Noel, NY, Lang, 1987, 211 pp., includes notes and essays on current critical attitudes. P.-M.

G. B. de Fernandez Pereiro, 'El origen de la tirada del infierno y el paraiso en Aucassin et Nicolette', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 418?26, sets the celebrated monologue alongside two pieces by Gautier de Coinci, suggesting skilful lampooning. 4. Lyric Poetry and Allied Genres Nigel Wilkins, The Lyric Art of Medieval France, Fulbourne (Cambs), New Press, 440 pp., is a most comprehensive and very readable survey. C. Lee, 'La solitudine del cuore: caratteri della lirica cortese in Francia', Bruni, Capitoli, pp. 49-78, studies the 'cceur et corps' motif. Doris Earnshaw, The Female Voice in Medieval Romance Lyric, NY, Lang, 180 pp., includes OF examples of the 'chanson de femme' in a (sometimes pretentious) essay on the emergence of the female persona. Ria Lemaire, Passions et positions. Contribution a une semiotique du sujet dans la poesie lyrique medievale en langues romanes, Amsterdam, Rodopi, 350 pp., also covers the OF field and feminism, stressing Fin'Amor as a male preoccupation, full of male-orientated language: at the most, women are offered an idealized cushion against their role in reality. D.

R. Dragonetti, 'Le Nombre sans egal', Hommage Zumthor, pp. 49-61, relates the lyric to Augustinian concepts of divine harmonies. Similarly, F. Ferrand, 'Les nombres dans Pespace-temps poetique des trouveres', ib., pp. 73-85, makes lyrical connections with the Trivium and Quadrivium, and notably with architectural patterning. Y. G. Lepage, 'L'edition des textes lyriques: le cas de Blond el de Nesle', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 88-99, urges the preservation of all variant readings. Gillebert de Berneville, Les Poesies, ed. Karen Fresco (TLF, 357), 312 pp., assembles all 35 pieces attributable to this mid-i3th-c. Arrageois; there is a good section on poetic technique. The Lyrics of Thibaut de Champagne, ed./transl.

Pensom, 'Thibaut de Champagne and the art of the trouvere', MAe, 57:1-26, tackles the rhythmic interpretation of OF lyric verse, and proposes the transfer of a model based on epic accent-stress. L. Lazzerini, 'A propos de YAube bilingue de Fleury', Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 552-53, reiterates her view of the poem as mystical allegory of the Passion. Medieval Debate Poetry, Vernacular Works, ed./transl. Michel-Andre Bossy (GLML, A. 52), 1987 (1988), xxxi 4- 191 pp., assembles 20 interesting texts from all quarters.

U. Malizia, Tntorno al lessico tecnico-musicale ne Les Miracles de Nostre Dame di Gautier de Coinci', Actes . . . (Trier), vi, 405-17: Gautier often refers to music, stressing that the only valid song is in praise of Mary, not of love. Annette Gamier, Mutation temporelle et cheminement spirituel: analyse et commentaire du Miracle de VEmpeeris de Gautier de Coinci, Champion, 131 pp., brings out the fine dramatic balance in Gautier's longest piece, with its conflicting themes of chastity and sexuality, innocence and guilt, and mysticism and realism. G. studies other poems in 'Autour de la mort. Temps de la dilation et purgatoire dans les Miracles de Nostre Dame de Gautier de Coinci', MA, 94:183-202, showing Gautier already working (c. 1218) on the idea of a dead soul still in need of protection. *La Litterature d'inspiration religieuse: theatre^ et vies de saints, ed.

La Legende de saint Brendan, decouvreur de VAmerique, ed. Jean-Pierre Bayard, La Maisnie Tredaniel, 220 pp., gives a modern Fr. version, with notes on historicity and symbolism. A. Guerreau-Jalabert, Tnceste et saintete: la Vie de Saint Gregoire en francais (Xlle siecle)', AESC, 43:1291-319, picks up a neglected socio-historical dimension, noting clear tensions between chivalric and monastic social structures (with the aristoc racy standing condemned). I. Short gives the text of'The Bodleian fragment of the Anglo-Norman Vision of St Paul by Adam de Ross', Woledge Vol., pp. 175-89: only 126 vv., but in fact the poem's oldest MS.

Raybin, 'The court and the tavern: bourgeois discourse in Li Jeus de Saint Nicola?, Viator, 19:177-92, argues against the charge of incongruity: Bodel is constructing two deliberate parallel worlds. A.

C. F. Barnes and L. R.

Carnes, Proverbia, contains a number of pieces of general relevance. M. Zink, 'Revelations de la memoire et masques du sens dans la poetique medievale', Oilier, Masques, pp. 251-60, starts from Richard de Fournival and notes how memory decodes allegory and unveils the sens. J. M. Beer comments on 'The new naturalism of Le Bestiaire dAmour', Reinardus, 1:16-21, and in so doing advances new reasons for a later dating of Richard's work (post-1255). M.

A. Tavera, 'Heritage semantique, heritage moral: a propos des allegories du Roman de la Rose deG.de Lorris', Actes . . .

Richards, 'The tradition of "otium litteratum" and Oiseuse in Le Roman de la Rose', SFr, 32 :271?73, observes that the Ovidian link between otium and luxuria only became common with Vincent de Beauvais: Guillaume's source is more likely to have been Seneca. Z. Marcinkowska, 'La prison amoureuse de Guillaume de Lorris', Medievales, no. 14:103-12, stresses the importance of the decor, as increasingly restricting the lover's space, and leading him from gaiety to melancholy.

E. Hicks, 'Fabliau et sous-litterature: regards sur le Prestre taint", ib., pp. 79-85, detects behind Gautier le Leu5s outrageousness the broad sexuality of the Male God. Richeut, ed. Philippe Vernay (RHel, 103), 149 pp., is tne first modern ed. to return to the actual MS. V. agrees that the text (datable to the later 12th c.) is not a true fabliau, although obviously possessing fabliau elements, and makes the case for the existence of an autonomous little Cycle de Richeut, with links with Renart as well as the fabliaux. D. Billotte stresses the importance of repetition in 'L'unite de Trubert: le sens d5une serie', Reinardus, 1:22-29. Batany, 'Trubert: progres et bousculade des masques5, Oilier, Masques, pp. 25-34, sees the plot's effect depending on tension between stable surroundings and a highly-mobile 'trickster5 reverting to atavistic shapes. J. Mann, 'The Roman de Renart and the Ysengrimus', Varty, Renart, 1, 135-62, accepts the profound influence of the Latin text (but comments on the Latin beast-fable5s Jack of influence). N. Fukumoto, N. Harano, and</page><page sequence="30">Early Medieval Literature 73 S. Suzuki contribute two notes on a recently discovered MS: 'Sur un nouveau fragment du Roman de Renart", Romania, 107, 1986 (1988): 397-400, and 'Sur le manuscrit t du Roman de Renart", Reinardus, 1:156-62. Three pieces by K. Varty, in Varty, Renart, 1: 'De l'appellation des branches et des contes du Roman de Renart" (7-12) returns to extant rubrics in order to break away from the numerals that deprive the texts of their lit. autonomy; 'L'economie des Romans de Renart" (13-49) collates an original initial Branch, around which MS tradition expands to form subsequently detached sequel anthologies; and 'Les anthologies dans le Roman de Renart le role de l'anthologiste-conteur dans la "Matiere de Renart'" (51-77) detects a skilled hand behind the use of minor anecdotes that bind together the substantial episodes. Another 'Branch' of three articles, by E. Suomela-Harma: 'Pour une typologie des Branches du Roman de Renart", ib., pp. 107-33, studies clear narrative sequences based on search-themes; 'Le Roman de Renart et le conte populaire francais', Reinardus, 1:142-55, observes the rich folk tradition coexisting with the Renart (itself notably more clerical in nature); and 'Des roux et des couleurs', Couleurs, pp. 401-21, sees natural description turned into a pejorative foxy epithet (before giving way to Renart's later chameleon skills). Similar ground is covered by R. Bellon, 'Renart li rous: remarques sur un point de l'onomastique renardienne', ib., pp. 15-28. P. Wackers, '"Mutorum animalium conloquium" or, Why do animals speak?', Reinardus. 1:163-74, insists on the precise use in the Reynard corpus of language as a weapon. M. de Combarieu du Gres, 'Les rapports entre les animaux et les hommes dans le Roman de Renart: langage de la force et force du langage', Varty, Renart, 1, 163-215, takes a rather general look at the beast/human relationship, and at the Renart's innovation in its scenes of animal triumph. B. Schmolke Hasselmann analyses 'L'art du comique dans le Roman de Renart: Renart teinturier et jongleur", ib., pp. 217?27, with particular emphasis on the Tristan-parody (and on the Renart's influence on later texts). L. Wright, 'Disguise as a minstrel. The literary backcloth to Renart jongleur", ib., pp. 229-38, looks more at the two traditions of the noble singer and the lowly performer. J. Dufournet, 'La reecriture dans la Confession de Renart (Branche vn du Roman de Renart). Jeux et enjeux', ib., pp. 95-106, deals with the transition into satire, with action reduced and anthropomorphism accentuated. J. Subrenat detects 'Symetries et dissymerries dans la branche ix du Roman de Renart", Reinardus, 1:130-41, again concerning human and animal couples. R. Bellon, 'Renart et Drouin: un recit original?', Varty, Renart, 1, 79-94: a lively popular story has become embedded in the long Renart Empereur Branch xi.</page></plain_text>
