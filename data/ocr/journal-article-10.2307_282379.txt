<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLATEAU INTERACTION SPHERE AND LATE PREHISTORIC CULTURAL COMPLEXITY Brian Hayden and Rick Schulting The Plateau culture area of northwestern North America fits the criteria of an interaction sphere. Understanding the general cultural dynamics responsible for the creation of interaction spheres has been poorly developed in archaeological and eth- nological theory. Data from the Plateau Interaction Sphere are used to argue that the main factor responsible for the emer- gence of interaction spheres in transegalitarian societies is the development of an elite class. Elites who seek to maximize their power and wealth at the tribal level do so in part by establishing trading, marriage, ideological, military, and other ties to elites in other communities and regions. They use these ties to monopolize access to desirable regional prestige goods and to enhance their own socioeconomic positions. In conformity with expectations derived from this model, the data from the Plateau demonstrate that interaction sphere goods are predominantly prestige items and that these concentrate in communi- ties that have the greatest potential to produce surplus and to develop socioeconomic inequalities. These same features also seem to characterize well-known interaction spheres elsewhere in the world. El area cultural del altiplano del noroeste de Norteamerica cumple con los criterios de una zona de interacci6n. Generalmente, la comprensi6n de lasfuerzas que crean las zonas de interacci6n no ha sido suficientemente desarrollada en la teoria arqueol6gica y etnol6gica. Los datos de la Zona de Interacci6n del Altiplano se utilizan para mostrar que elfactor principal responsable por el surgimiento de estas zonas en las sociedades "trans-igualitarias " es el desarrollo de las elites. Las elites que desean aumentar sus poderes y sus riquezas, cumplen sus deseos, en parte, por medio del intercambio, del ma- trimonio, asi como a traves de alianzas ideol6gicas, militares y de otro tipo con elites de otras comunidades y regiones. Las elites utilizan estas relaciones para monopolizar el acceso a los objetos de valor de estas regiones y para asegurar sus propias posiciones socioecon6micas. De acuerdo con las expectativas de este modelo, los datos del Altiplano muestran que los productos dentro del sistema de interacci6n son pricipalmente objetos de valor; ademds estos datos muestran que esos productos son mis abundantes en las comunidades con mayor potencial para producir excedentes y para establecer desigual- dades socioecon6micas. Al mismo tiempo, estos aspectos parecen caracterizar otras zonas de interacci6n muy conocidas en otras partes del mundo. T he northwestern Plateau of North America has long been recognized as a coherent and relatively homogeneous culture area with a distinctive hunting and salmon-based economy including significant food-storage capabilities, logistical residential patterning, and many com- mon social and cultural traits (Kroeber 1939; Ray 1939; Sanger 1968a; Swanson 1962; Willey 1966; Wood 1980:105-106). The cultural similarities between groups on the Plateau may be due to a number of factors. Common historical origins may have played a role since the area is domi- nated by Interior Salish speakers. However, the southern part of the Plateau was inhabited by Sahaptian speakers with different origins, while outlying groups such as Athapaskan, Shoshonean, Chinook, and the possibly Algonkian-related Kutenai speakers provide still more historical diversity. Thus, other factors besides common historical origins must be invoked to explain similarities among Plateau groups. The homogeneity of the Plateau communities may also be viewed as a product of similar subsistence adaptations by dif- ferent groups to the same basic Plateau type of environment. While this ecological perspective certainly can account for a significant amount of similarity in basic subsistence technology, it pro- Brian Hayden * Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6 Canada Rick Schulting * Department of Archaeology, University of Reading, Reading RG6 2AA England American Antiquity, 62(1), 1997, pp. 51-85.

Moreover, nei- ther the culture historical nor the subsistence eco- logical perspective adequately accounts for the variability that does exist in the area: the similar- ities among some widely separated centers and the differing natures of intervening groups. In order to better understand the nature of the similarities and differences among Plateau com- munities, we propose to examine the Plateau as a distinctive interaction sphere during Late Prehistoric times, particularly during what Richards and Rousseau (1987) have termed the Plateau and Kamloops horizons in British Columbia (2400-200 B.P.). For heuristic pur- poses, the complex of relatively similar Plateau cultures will be referred to as the "Plateau Interaction Sphere." We will refrain from using acronyms. Caldwell (1964) defines an interaction sphere as involving several distinctive cultures that may retain their distinctiveness at the level of subsistence technology and local crafts, but which share a common set of supralocal values, rituals, behavior, styles, and materials. These supralocal cultural aspects are maintained by interactions and exchanges between communities. Much later, Dalton (1975) suggested that interaction spheres were also characterized by pre-state politics and population levels, lineages or clan organizations, the use of primitive valuables for the establish- ment of alliances, and by endemic conflict. High levels of conflict were reported ethnographically for many Plateau groups (Bouchard and Kennedy 1985:58-61; Cannon 1992; Dawson 1891:25; Kent 1980; Teit 1909:540, 550, 1928); there were fortified settlements (Lamb 1960:80-82; Teit 1906:235-236, 239); and archaeologists have found substantial evidence for violent conflict (Chatters 1989; Lynch 1978; Rice 1978; Schulting and Oliver 1997; Smith 1977). Although J. Caldwell (1964) does not empha- size the role of elites, it is clear from the examples that he, Dalton, and others provide that interaction Site Identifications for Figures (Numbers represent those used on maps; black polygons indicate the presence of an artifact type.) 1 Wildcat Canyon, 35GM9 3 Wahluke, 45GR306 5 Okanagan area 6 Lytton 7 Chase, EeQwl 8 Dalles 9 Bell, EeRk4 10 Keatley, EeR17 11 Wells Reservoir 12 Priest Rapids 13 Vantage 16 Chief Joseph 18 Herzog 20 Wakemap, 45KL26 22 Lochnore-Nesikep locality 23 Willamette Valley and Pleasant Hill 24 Bonneville 26 McMinnville 27 Arlington 29 Crab Creek 30 Potholes, 45GR131 31 Roaring Springs Cave 32 Basket Maker II 33 Humboldt Cave 34 Dalles Cremation 35 Colowesh Bottom/ Leachman 36 Congdon II, 45KL41 37 Atlatl Valley 38 Fish Hook Island. 45FR42 39 North Yakima 40 Sntl'exwenewixwtn, 450K355 41 Hayes Island 43 Moha Mile 8 44 Large 45 Nicoamen, EbRi7 46 Nicola Lake 47 Lower Nicola 48 Government 49 Grand Forks 51 Snehumption Creek 52 Whitestone Creek, 45FE24 54 Palouse River 55 Captain John Creek 56 Kouse Creek 58 Berrian's Island, 45BN3 59 Bead Patch 60 Maybe 61 Indian Well, 45KL42 64 Oliver, DhQv26 66 Deschutes area 67 Big Leap 72 B.

Earle 1990 and McGuire 1992). Thus, the existence of significant socioeconomic inequality is implied for interaction spheres. For conve- nience we refer to people at the top of these hier- archies as "elites" (see Blau 1977 for definition and discussion). The existence of these elites within Plateau communities is amply documented ethnographically and has been demonstrated archaeologically for the Late Prehistoric period of the Plateau by Schulting (1995) and Hayden (1996; Hayden and Spafford 1993). Following Dalton, it can be argued that because interaction between communities primarily involves elites, the supralocal similarities between communities involve elite goods and rituals more than common utilitarian items.</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2. The presence/absence distribution of nephrite on the Plateau (see Table 1). Despite sources largely restricted to the northern Plateau, note the concentrations on the Middle Columbia River. In order to examine Plateau communities as a possible example of an interaction sphere in the above sense, it is necessary to identify items that can be reasonably viewed as elite, or prestige, goods. It is also necessary to identify basic sub- sistence items and styles and to determine the rel- ative development of wealth and socioeconomic inequality within various communities. At the regional and culture-area levels, it is also neces- sary to identify factors that can explain differ- ences and similarities between communities in interaction patterns and exchanged goods. Our approach assumes that wealthier communities with more powerful and richer elites should be more similar to each other in terms of prestige goods and styles, even at considerable distances, than to poorer communities lacking the ability to support strong or wealthy elites. In taking this perspective, we view the emergence of elites, as well as the interaction and exchange between 54 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="5">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU them, as the product of relatively abundant but spatially restricted resources that are not suscepti- ble to overexploitation (Hayden 1990, 1992). Regional Subsistence Item Traditions Because of the general homogeneity of the Plateau environment, the basic subsistence adap- tations do not differ as dramatically as they do in interaction spheres with more heterogeneous environments. Nevertheless, there are some strik- ing regional differences in subsistence technolo- gies and their associated styles. For instance, the very long pestles and associated mortars found in the southwestern and central part of the Plateau are generally absent from the Canadian Plateau. Styles of shorter pestles also vary regionally. Similarly, although fish is an important staple everywhere, several styles of net weights com- monly occur in varying relative frequencies in the southern region, including perforated, notched, and girdled varieties. Most of these varieties appear to be absent from the Canadian Plateau, although Smith (1910:144) remarks casually that notched sinkers are found in the Thompson area. The use of harpoons, leisters, and multi- pronged fish spears is similarly variable, with a number of regional stylistic variants of each type (harpoons can have composite valved heads or single-piece heads that occur in a number of basic styles). Fish-processing technologies also display stylistic differences by region, with ground-slate fish knives reported for the Lytton, Thompson, and Shuswap areas (Sanger 1968a:107; Smith 1899:140, 1900:414), but not elsewhere. Finally, atlatl weights are found in the Middle Columbia region (Butler and Osborne 1959; Schulting 1995:45) but are lacking on the Canadian Plateau, while basic projectile point styles differ consider- ably from region to region. Shiner (1961:246), for example, notes few similarities between the point types of Lytton and the Lower Snake River. In explaining such differences, Sanger (1969) points out the very different cultural origins of groups occupying the Fraser vs. the Columbia drainages. Distinctive linguistic and technological vari- ability existed on the Plateau, indicating that a number of local traditions maintained some of their original cultural heritage despite the need to adapt to similar environments. These distinctive cultural origins probably also account for the slight degree of regional stylistic variation that occurs in virtually all artifact types. Given the varying cultural origins of the Plateau groups, however, when attention is turned from subsis- tence artifacts to those related to ideology, pres- tige, and art, similarities can no longer be explained in terms of the environment. Other fac- tors must be invoked to explain the similarities in the domain of nonsubsistence ideological materi- als. We will first document the similarities within this class of materials on the Plateau, and then elaborate on explanations as to why we believe there are such strong similarities in these objects on the Plateau. Sampling Unfortunately, the quality of the archaeological data that can be used for examining distribution patterning across the Plateau is extremely vari- able. Some reported occurrences are not even associated with sites, but only localities or regions. Some excavations were conducted by amateurs and lack contextual or temporal associ- ations; some excavations constitute small tests or opportunistic discoveries; some excavations are of very large magnitude or are part of regional salvage surveys; some sites are residential, while others are burial sites (ranging from single graves to entire cemeteries). Given this much variability in the limited database available, no meaningful sampling design seemed possible. On the other hand, in terms of the broad distributional perspec- tive that we were adopting in this heuristic exer- cise, it seemed that the broad presence/absence distributions of various cultural items at these dif- ferent types of sites were meaningful. Clearly, substantial areas might lack observations, but the broad range and spectrum of activities of both amateurs and professionals along the length of the Columbia and Fraser river drainages over the past 50 to 100 years leads us to expect that the pres- ence/absence data we have gathered is generally reflective of real distributions.

In either case, it is generally difficult for lower ranking members of communities to obtain prestige items. Context must also be considered if the arguments presented for the recognition of the following prestige items are to be accepted. Unfortunately, there has been considerable loot- ing of many Plateau burial sites, particularly in what we suspect to be the richest regions-The Dalles region (at the confluences of the Deschutes River with the Columbia River) and the Lytton- Lillooet region (at and immediately north of the confluence of the Thompson River with the Fraser 57</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY River). Thus, for many specimens little contextual information is available. Still, in general, it seems fairly clear that items within the majority of the artifact classes discussed below tend to be found in burial contexts (Schulting 1995; see also Tables 1 and 2). When these items are found in housepit or midden contexts, they are often broken. A wide range of prestige materials circulated on the Plateau, including copper, dentalia and other marine shells, whalebone, nephrite, graphite, galena, and fine silicious lithics. It seems likely that certain bird feathers were also widely exchanged. Table 1 presents an initial appraisal of the distribution of these materials from sites in the core area of the Plateau. Some of the items, such as dentalia shells, and to a lesser degree nephrite, (Figures 1 and 2) are very wide- spread, although both materials are quite restricted in terms of their origins: dentalia from restricted locations in California and on the west coast of Vancouver Island; nephrite from the Fraser and Thompson rivers and also from the Rogue River in Oregon (Strong 1959; Smith [1900:406] also recorded some "float" nephrite boulders along the Nooksack River in Washington). Other materials such as copper, graphite, and galena are distinctive enough to indicate special and similar cultural values associated with these materials, but occur much more sporadically. Because of the low frequencies of these objects, it is difficult to determine whether their occurrence is governed by accidental finds, regional differ- ences in values, varying access of communities by reason of wealth differentials, or simply sampling biases and sizes. No source is indicated for graphite, while the only sources of galena of which we are aware occur on the western slopes of the Cascades (Butler and Osborne 1959:216) and in the Kamloops area (Cole and Lockner 1989). Native copper is reported by Smith (1899:113) to occur in the mountains around Lytton and by Dawson (cited in Sanger 1968a:125) as occurring at Copper Creek at the west end of Kamloops Lake. Boas (1890:85) writes: "Copper was obtained, partly by trade, but some was dug by the natives themselves. There was a digging at Kamloops Lake, which was worked up to the last generation, when a man was killed by a fall of rocks which buried the mine. Since that time it has never been worked." Teit (1912b:343-4) reports another source at Green Lake between Lillooet and Squamish. Native cop- per nuggets also occur as placer deposits in the Bridge River near Lillooet, and another source may be present at Copper Creek in southwestern Washington. Whatever its origins, materials from these sources must have been traded over consid- erable distances (Figure 3). The alacrity with which groups all over the Northwest sought out copper from the first European traders is testi- mony to the prestige and value that this material must have conferred in pre-contact times (see Stapp 1984). Obsidian was available from a number of sources (the best in central Oregon), was widely traded (Carlson 1994; Nelson et al. 1975), and also may have been a material with considerable prestige attached to it, at least in some parts of the Plateau. While obsidian surely had a more practi- cal role in early prehistoric periods when more egalitarian hunter-gatherers foraged over very large ranges, it seems to have acquired more of a status role in Late Prehistoric times when band ranges were much more restricted, and many raw materials such as obsidian had to be obtained by exchange. In Late Prehistoric times, large obsid- ian blades and large finely made points are par- ticularly associated with high status (Butler 1959; Crabtree 1957; Krieger 1928a; Seaman 1946). Crafted Prestige Items There is a wide array of distinctively crafted pres- tige items that display remarkable similarities across the Plateau, or at least between communi- ties with similar population and wealth profiles. These items include bone and antler combs, incised tooth and bone gaming pieces, antler dig- ging-stick handles, bone tubes, L-shaped awls, fine tubular pipes, zoomorphic and nipple top mauls, zoomorphic bowls, bone and stone clubs, eccentric chipped-stone pieces and pendants, shaped slate pendants, rock art motifs, thinned incised decorative bone, incised dentalia shells, bird and predator claws, and perforated elk canines. And we would add nephrite celts/adzes, dogs, and slaves as prestige items. We will not deal at length with all of these categories since the 58 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="9">59 Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU Figure 3.

However, we will briefly draw on the major archaeological and ethnographic works of the area in order to comment on some of these categories since it may not be evident why all of them should be considered prestige items. The major occurrences of the crafted prestige items are presented in Table 2. The carefully crafted ground-stone and sculp- tured bone prestige objects are the most distinct in the area. In general, they exhibit shapes other than those that are created for use, shapes that are time consuming to make and cumbersome or delicate to handle.

Moreover, virtually all these items could be much more easily crafted of softer materials such as wood. In fact, there appears to be a largely unrecognized bias in most ethnographies and archaeological analysis that predisposes readers to view illustrated and described objects as "nor- mal" equipment for all families in communities. Careful reading of the British Columbian ethno- graphies reveals that early ethnographers focused almost entirely on the more spectacular objects in study communities, that is, objects owned by the wealthiest and most prestigious members of the community. Teit (1900:186ff; 1906:218-220) makes this very clear in his discussion of cloth- ing. Rich families had buckskin clothes of very high quality, and these are the ones that are illus- trated (see Tepper 1987). But such clothing was far from the norm. In fact, very few families had buckskin clothes; most families had bark capes and garments. Significantly, Teit includes no illustrations of these poorer Plateau garments. Similarly, Kennedy and Bouchard (1992:288, 290) report that leisters and fish hooks were typi- cally made of hard wood. A few bone examples are known from the archaeological record but the numbers recovered are far from what one would expect of fishing-adapted cultures. Why did some people use wood and others use bone, and why are there so few examples of bone leisters? We sug- gest that bone was much more difficult to work than hard woods, and only those individuals who wanted to enhance the prestige of their tools took the trouble of making ordinary implements out of bone. The vast majority of leisters, as well as har- poons, combs, mortars, pipes, digging-stick han- dles, awls, needles (e.g., Cressman 1960:34), and perhaps even wedges, may all have been made of hard woods that simply have not been preserved, if, in fact, average families even took the trouble to make combs, pipes, and digging-stick handles. Results from excavations of wet sites, such as Ozette, on the Washington coast, certainly demonstrate that the vast majority of most objects such as arrow points and wedges were made of wood, with only a small proportion made of bone or stone (Friedman 1975). Thus, we argue that to a large extent, the very fact that bone or ground stone was used at all for 62 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="13">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU Figure 4. A decorated antler digging-stick handle from Lytton, British Columbia (Smith 1899:137). some artifacts can be a good reason for consider- ing these artifacts as prestige items. A few artifact types may have required harder materials, such as stone adzes and grinding stones, but these appear to be the exception rather than the rule on the Plateau. We now turn to consider individual artifact types. Digging-Stick Handles Antler digging-stick handles (Figures 4 and 5) are one of the most widespread and distinctive items of the Plateau, although a very few examples have also been reported from the Washington and Oregon coasts (Connolly 1992:98; Roderick Sprague and Ken Ames, personal communication 1995). They are also highly unusual and perhaps unique features of digging sticks. We know of nothing quite comparable to them anywhere else in the world. Cressman (1960:70) indicates that they had a special status, being made for specific young female members of a community and given to them as personal possessions for life. Such behavior seems far more appropriate for high- ranking families than it does for more ordinary families. The central shaft holes must have been fairly time consuming to make given stone tech- nology. The white, polished, and often engraved handle of a digging stick would be highly visible in any task group and in any encampment. As Wobst (1977) argues, highly visible objects are the most effective for communicating social mes- sages, such as relative rank, to others. Roots were a very important staple resource on the Plateau. Women dug roots in task groups that worked in close proximity, and thus the tools being used could be displayed to advantage. The ability to dig many roots was seen as an indication of strong guardian spirit power and made the successful woman desirable as a wife (Marshall 1991). Thus antler digging-stick handles are good potential candidates for prestige items, especially if ordi- nary digging sticks had handles made of wood (Nancy Turner, personal communication 1993; Cole and Lockner 1989:417; Smith 1910:35; Teit 1909:514) or lacked handles altogether, which is the usual case elsewhere in the world. Desmond Peters, Sr., a senior member of the Pavilion Band, near Lillooet, British Columbia, told us in 1991 that digging-stick handles made of antler or ocean-spray wood (Holodiscus discolor) were harder to make than handles made of other woods and would be traded. He thought that only traders and hunters' families probably had antler handles. Moreover, while antler handles are widely distrib- uted archaeologically, they are also relatively rare-much rarer, we would argue, than one would expect if they had been used by every female throughout the Plateau for every genera- tion over a period of several thousand years. Combs Combs (Figure 6) are also obvious display items indicative of prestige, particularly striking given the contrast of white bone on dark hair and the elaborate carving involved in many specimens. These items are considerably more labor intensive to produce than digging-stick handles and are much rarer in the area. Yet the similarities between examples from opposite ends of the Plateau demonstrate strong interactive connec- tions between families using them, as well as sim- ilar aesthetics and values involved in their manufacture and use. Cross-culturally, hair is often associated with power and status. A distinc- tive group of antler and stone human figure carv- 63</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 5. The presence/absence distribution of antler digging-stick handles on the Plateau (see Table 2).

On the Columbia Plateau, many of these carvings also show obvi- ous connections to Tsagiglalal-a highly distinc- tive and elaborate rock art image overlooking the Long Narrows near The Dalles (Butler 1957; Keyser 1992; Ostapkowicz 1994). Bone Tubes The use of elaborately carved bone drinking tubes during female puberty and menstrual rituals is another widespread phenomenon. However, given the lengthy time that women were supposed to 64 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="15">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU stay secluded for these rituals (2-4 years for first menses [Teit 1906:265]), it is difficult to imagine that all women religiously adhered to such ideals. Rather, as in the case of bone artifacts, the elabo- rate descriptions of training and rituals seem far more appropriate to the highest ranking and wealthiest families of a community who could use such events to display their wealth, leisure, and superior spirituality. Teit (1900, 1906), Nastich (1954) and Romanoff (1992b) all repeatedly stress the importance of proper training and upbringing for elite families. It is proper training and conduct that largely distinguished the elites from other families in the communities. And we suggest that it is predominantly the idealized elite view of how things should be done that has been recorded in most Plateau ethnographies. As with other prestige classes, bone drinking tubes tend to be rare archaeologically and, we suspect, were not even used by most families prehistorically. Incised Dentalia and Other Marine Shells Geometrically incised dentalia shells are found in widely dispersed places (Figures 1 and 7) and seem well established as a prestige item. While no examples have been reported archaeologically from The Dalles, Spier and Sapir (1930) note that for the Wishram (the group occupying The Dalles in the ethnographic period) the addition of fine incised designs considerably enhanced the value of the shells. The designs would often be rubbed with red ochre to bring them out (Weld 1963). And unlike plain dentalia shells, incised speci- mens are relatively rare, although they are wide- spread (Erickson 1990). The incising simply strengthens the inference that similar aesthetics and values accompanied the use of these shells within the Plateau, making it distinctive from the neighboring Northwest Coast interaction sphere. Many species of marine shell-including Olivella, Haliotis, Glycymeris, Aletes, and Pecten-were used as beads and pendants on the Plateau. Large shell rings are much rarer; exam- ples are known from the Upper Columbia (Collier et al. 1942:97, 155) and from Skwaam Bay on the shores of Adams Lake in the Shuswap (Hills 1971). At Keatley Creek we recovered fragments of a shell bracelet, and there may be other exam- ples of these in Washington (James Chatters, per- Figure 6. Bone combs from the Bell site (left) near Lillooet and Neah Bay (right) (Stryd 1981a; Bergen 1960). sonal communication 1989). These too, are undoubtedly part of the Plateau elite complex. Teeth and Claws The use of raptor and predator claws, as well as the use of pierced teeth (most presumably as dis- play items), is also widespread. However, we have not documented archaeological occurrences because we wanted to concentrate on more dis- tinctive artifact types. It is interesting to note that, with very few exceptions, only the canine teeth of elk were perforated for use as pendants-only two such teeth are present per animal, and thus a neck- lace of 20 or more teeth (not at all uncommon) would seem to indicate and advertise considerable hunting success (Schulting 1995:37). Sprague (1959) even reported a child burial with 230 elk teeth. Occasionally incised designs would be added to the teeth (Collier et al. 1942:89; Pokotylo et al. 1987:5). 65</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 7. Examples of incised dentalium shells from Kamloops, British Columbia (Smith 1900:431). L-Shaped Awls Bone awls are not usually considered prestige items, and indeed, the more typical ulna awls are easy enough to make and effective in basket mak- ing and other piercing functions. However, the elbow, or L-shaped shoulder blade awl is some- what different (Figure 8). Not only are these awls made from scapulae, which must be greatly reduced in size and carefully worked, but they also have a distinctive thin lateral protrusion at the proximal end for which few functional purposes can be suggested. It appears to be more a distinc- tive iconological motif meant to convey informa- tion. One other attribute of these awls is noteworthy: their generally needlelike points. Despite their widespread distribution on the Plateau and some parts of the Great Basin, they are comparatively rare archaeologically. Because of the unusual amount of bone reduction required for their manufacture, and because of their rarity, their unusual stylistic features, and the sharpness of their points, we suggest that these awls may have been primarily used by elite families in ways that would enhance their visibility within commu- nities. The most probable activities include tattoo- ing and/or the piercing of ears or nasal septa. Nastich (1954:64) records that sharply pointed pieces of bone were in fact used for piercing nasal septa. It would be logical to expect elites to use more elaborate implements than others for such operations, if in fact ordinary families even pierced their noses or used tattooing. Ethnographically, piercing of the ears and/or nose can be linked with high status for a number of Plateau groups (Cline et al. 1938:49; Curtis 1911:93; Spier and Sapir 1930:261; Teit 1900:321, 1930:236). In many ranked cultures, these displayed privileges are reserved for the highest ranking families (e.g., Handy 1924; Keddie 1981:60; Krause 1956:166; Murdoch 1892:139; Olson 1967:49; Paine 1979). Gaming Pieces Another extremely widespread artifact type that might be expected to be used differentially by the Figure 8.

Examples of lahal gaming pieces from The Dalles (three at right), the Thompson River (three at left) and Keatley Creek (center) (Smith 1900:428; Strong 1959:201). wealthy is the decorated gaming piece (Figures 9 and 10). These were short sections of bone about 5 cm in length, some of which were decorated with incised geometric lines (generally zigzags), and some of which were plain. Decorated and undeco- rated beaver or woodchuck teeth appear to have been stylistic variants. Gambling was a popular activity on the Plateau, and The Dalles in particu- lar was known as ". .. a gambling mecca second to none" (Butler 1957:160). The object of the lahal contests in which these bones were used was to guess which hand the decorated piece was in. Because playing often entailed substantial wagers, the game in its more elaborate forms must be viewed as one played by and between elites who probably used relatively impressive display pieces. Commoners might also play, but the stakes as well as the gaming pieces were likely much less sub- stantial. Among the Wishram, Spier and Sapir (1930:267) note that "Not all women had nicely marked dice." We suggest that, prehistorically, ordinary gaming pieces, similar to those we have seen used in informal lahal games in the Lillooet area, were probably made of wood. Almost identi- cal bone specimens from the farthest comers of the Plateau (Figure 9) indicate strong interactions between elites from these regions in which gam- bling and playing lahal for substantial stakes was undoubtedly a hallmark of elite behavior. It was an ostentatious display of elite rank, much as high- stakes gambling is a display of status among some elites of our own era. Decorated Thinned Bone Minor pieces of bone also showed many similari- ties among Plateau communities, especially thinned bone sheets decorated with incised geo- metric patterns (James Chatters, personal com- munication 1991). These are somewhat generic and certainly seem to fit into elite decoration; however, more work is required to adequately describe the context and variation of these objects within Plateau society and archaeology. We will not deal with them in detail here. Sculpted Clubs Carefully carved and sculptured bone and stone clubs can be reasonably assigned to elite contexts (Figure 11). In fact, it is a relatively common trait in cultural evolution throughout the world for emerging elites to express their position, wealth, and power by means of elaborate clubs or maces. The first elites of Egypt, the Near East, Neolithic England, and Oceania come readily to mind, and there are undoubtedly many more examples. The generally high quality of sculptured clubs on the Plateau (see Boas 1907; Smith 1907; Wingert 1952) clearly indicates their elite context, as does their rarity, and the high cost of producing them and acquiring most of the materials (including whalebone in the Willamette, The Dalles, Upper Columbia, Lillooet, and Kamloops/Chase areas). Stylistic similarities between the Lytton and The Dalles examples can leave little doubt that elites in 67 II I., 1(, t"? Ii\Y3</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 10. The presence/absence distribution of lahal gaming pieces on the Plateau (see Table 2). Note the strongly clus- tered occurrences in the region around the Snake and Columbia river confluence and in the Lillooet-Lytton region around the Thompson and Fraser river confluence, as well as a few secondary centers. both areas shared very similar aesthetics and values and were using clubs in comparable social contexts to convey similar messages to their respective com- munities. A striking example involves two nearly identical copper clubs with incised human faces on their blades: one was found near The Dalles (Bergen 1959) and the other at Spuzzum on the Fraser River below Lytton (Smith 1899:150). Both were in burial contexts. While these specimens undoubtedly date to the protohistoric period, their form and the added designs are paralleled in pre- historic stone and whalebone clubs from the same regions (Boas 1907). Stone Bowls Another artifact type that seems to occur fre- 68 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="19">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU quently in the context of emerging and early elites is carved and sculptured stone bowls (e.g., Gero 1989:104; Schmandt-Besserat 1977). These, too, make good objects for displaying special status and rank on formal occasions when others are attending. Both plain and sculptured stone bowls are extremely characteristic of the Plateau, and in some areas grade into zoomorphic or anthropo- morphic sculptures without any apparent utilitar- ian function. Because of the great variability in the bowls' forms, and indeed in other stone sculp- ture as well, further documentation and analysis of similarities and differences in style and mean- ing-an effort beyond the scope of this paper-is required. Nevertheless, the general similarities of numerous examples from throughout the area are evident and, in conjunction with the geometric incising of bone, constitute a distinctive Plateau artistic style. Strong et al. (1930:114) remark on the consid- erable similarities between the ground stone of The Dalles and the Lytton area, as opposed to that of central Washington. These two areas exhibit a large and elaborate stone-carving industry, one which is not expressed to nearly the same degree over the intervening area (cf. Duff 1956:111). An excellent example of a strong stylistic similarity is seen in two anthropomorphic stone-head bowls, one from the vicinity of The Dalles (Maryhill Museum, Catalog No. 101-15) and the other from near Yale, British Columbia (Smith 1907:428, Figure 192b). The highly distinctive seated human figure complex of British Columbia (Duff 1956, 1975) has strong parallels at The Dalles (Figure 12). Buehler (1956) describes a seated human steatite figure (the majority of the bowls found on the Fraser River, possibly the center of the style, are of steatite). While the figure in Buehler's accompanying photograph does not cradle a bowl, it does assume the familiar posture of a seated human figure, arms folded on drawn-up knees, the head tilted back, and the prominent eyes star- ing upward. Skeletal imagery, another common element in the style, is present in the form of incised ribs. Stylistically, this sculpture is nearly identical to those of the Fraser River. Although less readily recognizable, there is another stone figure from The Dalles area that also exhibits cer- tain features reminiscent of the seated human fig- *f Washington, Seattle). ure complex. Some bird-headed (owl?) mauls are also stylistically identical in the two regions (Figure 12). Pipes Other ground-stone artifacts that might be associ- ated with elites include finely shaped nipple-top and sculptured zoomorphic mauls, nephrite celts/adzes, and steatite tubular pipes. Of these, the finer examples of tubular pipes (Figure 13) were clearly prized possessions. Many specimens are finely incised with geometric designs (Butler 1957; Sanger 1968a; Strong 1959), and some are fully sculptural (Crabtree 1957); one particularly fine example, the Moses Coulee Pipe (Strong 1959:137-139), was found near Wenatchee, fir ef tb iig Figure 11.

The presence/absence distribution of tubular stone pipes on the Plateau (see Table 2). Note the strong clus- tering of pipes around the confluence of the Deschutes and Snake rivers with the Columbia River and in the Lillooet- Lytton region (around the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser rivers) as well as a few secondary centers. There is some question over the prehistoric pres- ence of native tobacco on the Plateau. Recent attempts to identify nicotine or its byproducts in pipe residues from the Keatley Creek site have thus far yielded negative results, and today many Lillooet or Thompson men still smoke a wide range of native plant materials without tobacco (Turner et al. 1990:24; Hayden, personal observa- tion). But whatever the substance used, there is lit- tle doubt that smoking using prestigious-looking and costly pipes was an elite-associated ceremony and confirmed that participants shared the same set of cultural values and were of approximately equal status, capable of performing as elites should. Men of lower status also may have smoked tobacco or other herbs on occasion, but more likely</page><page sequence="22">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY they would have used cruder versions of steatite pipes, or perhaps wooden pipes (documented for the Lower Columbia [Strong 1959:139]), or per- haps not even smoked at all but snuffed (Strong 1959) or chewed various botanicals. Nephrite Celts/Adzes As mentioned earlier, sources of nephrite (Figure 2) are relatively restricted on the Plateau, the most important source being centered along the Middle Fraser River. Nephrite artifacts almost invariably occur in the form of ground- and polished-stone adzes or celts. As has long been recognized (Smith 1910:63; Mackie 1995), whereas nephrite celts/adzes on the coast tend to be found in mid- den contexts and only when near the end of their use lives, those in the interior are more often found in burial contexts and are often very large and polished over their entire surfaces (Darwent 1996; Schulting 1995). The manufacture of nephrite adzes with traditional technology is so labor intensive that it may be one of the best archaeological indicators that we have for slavery. At a cutting rate of only one or two millimeters per hour (Darwent 1996; Johnson 1975), it is dif- ficult to imagine anyone making one of these adzes unless they were generously compensated for their efforts or unless they were forced to. Nevertheless, nephrite adzes are widespread, although rather low in frequency. Moreover, on the Plateau, adzes included in burials are often so long that they do not appear to be made for use. A similar development occurred in Neolithic Europe and in ethnographic New Guinea. Ethnographic accounts of long nephrite "bars" used exclusively as wealth items on the Plateau support the inference that nephrite adzes, espe- cially the long ones, were important wealth items (Emmons 1923). Even today, nephrite adzes recovered archaeologically from the lower Snake River are viewed by Nez Perce informants as hav- ing strong power (Roderick Sprague, personal communication 1995). At Keatley Creek and else- where on the Plateau, antler chisels with ham- mers, chipped-stone adzes, or ground-stone adzes made of softer igneous rocks constituted alter- nate, lower-cost technological strategies for cut- ting wood (Darwent 1996; Teit 1900:183, 1909:644). Unfortunately, it is difficult to document the presence of slaves in the archaeological record (although see Schulting 1995 for possible examples in the burial record of the Plateau) other than by inferences such as these. However, early ethnogra- phies demonstrate that slaves were integral parts of elite displays of power in some Plateau communi- ties, particularly the wealthiest such as the Wishram of The Dalles and the Fraser Riverr Lillooet. Pendants Pendants are prominent display items with little pretension for any other function. Distinctive Plateau pendants that plausibly fit into the elite complex include the raptor and predator claws and pierced teeth already mentioned, as well as several very distinctive and widespread chipped-stone varieties. The chipped-stone pendants are serrated and grade into point styles with extreme curvilin- ear edges that were clearly never meant to be func- tional (Figure 14). In fact, their positions in excavations have indicated they were used as "bangles" rather than as arrowheads (Strong 1959:132). Another possibility suggested by a number of researchers is that these items func- tioned as nose ornaments, to be inserted through a pierced septum (Dumond and Minor 1983; Strong 1959:160-161). This may be supported by the smoothed edges found on many specimens. Rather unique bone variants of the serrated pendants, also with smooth edges, occur at the two extremes: Wildcat Canyon (Dumond and Minor 1983: Plate 3Fi) and the Lochnore-Nesikep locality near Lytton (Sanger 1970:94). Ground-stone pendants also occur at least at one site (Keatley Creek). Multinotch points appear to form a typological continuum with these clearly nonfunctional pieces, and it is worthwhile considering the possi- bility that multinotches were not primarily func- tional parts of projectile points as much as iconological stylistic elements meant to convey social information. These pendant and point styles are so unique and distinctive that they clearly represent strong interactions on the part of their makers and users; and they likely had simi- lar meanings in their respective societies. They again occur at the extremes of the Plateau area: Lytton and The Dalles.

Such objects require 73</page><page sequence="24">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY considerable skill to make, they are delicate, and they have no obvious technological function. Moreover, they are so unique that they clearly attest to intimate interactions on the parts of their users and makers. An interesting note by Atkinson (1937) may refer to an eccentric: he observed that an "unusually shaped chipped agate piece belonged to an Okanagan chief and was sacred." Domestic Dogs Before turning to the broader implications of this interaction sphere model, we would like to men- tion one other type of archaeological occurrence not generally associated with hunter/gatherer elites but which may prove important in this con- text: domesticated dogs. Although we cannot as yet determine the exact role of dogs in Plateau society, there is now abun- dant evidence that domesticated dogs did play an important role in the rituals of some Plateau com- munities and that they were strongly associated with elites. In at least some respects, dogs func- tioned like slaves to display individual power and wealth through sacrifice. Both dogs and slaves, for example, could be killed on the death of their owner (Curtis 1911:99; Ray 1939:32; Spier and Sapir 1930:212, 271; Teit 1900:328, 1906:270, 1909:592), and both were used to perform drudge work (Crellin [1994] documents the use of dogs for packing heavy loads prehistorically). Similarly, on a cross-cultural basis, domesticated dogs and slaves only appear ethnographically (and archaeologically where determinations can be made) in complex vs. generalized hunter-gath- erers. For example, elaborate dog burials are known from the complex hunter-gatherers of Mesolithic southern Scandinavia (Larsson 1989, 1990). Complex hunter/gatherers are character- ized by socioeconomic inequality and prestige display technologies (Hayden 1990, 1995). The association of dog breeding with elites continues to occur even after domestication, as in the Celtic elite breeding of prime hunting dogs as prestige items, and even the breeding of dogs by pre- Industrial and Industrial elites. On the Northwest Coast, a special breed of dog was developed, probably by the elites, for the use of their wool in the manufacture of blankets (Schulting 1993). Plateau hunting dogs, too, were bred, and desir- able studs were loaned out (Post 1938:33). On the other hand, dogs deemed useless for these elite purposes were probably left to scavenge wastes and constituted a separate class of vagrant "garbage" dogs. Dog remains are sometimes found with human burials (Collier et al. 1942:43; Sanger 1968b; Smith 1900:438-439, 1910:154); these, however, may simply represent the killing of dogs on the deaths of their owners. A wider ritual importance is indicated for dogs by the curation of their skulls and by what appears to be ritual deposition of dog remains. At Keatley Creek, near Lillooet, we uncovered a total of eight separate skulls in the bottom of two large internal storage pits adjacent to each other, as well as the cranial and postcra- nial remains of one whole dog in each pit (Crellin 1994). In addition to this, a single dog skull was left in the middle of the living floor at the time of final abandonment of this structure. In another pithouse, the articulated postcranial remains of an immature dog were left in the middle of the floor at the time of final abandonment. Far to the south, at Wildcat Canyon, six dogs were buried in a sin- gle pit (Dumond and Minor 1983:104, 130) in what was clearly a ritual context: projectile point fragments were found embedded in the thoracic regions of two dogs, at least one had been decap- itated, and the backs of all the dogs had been bro- ken. Three of the bodies had been carefully placed in a circular arrangement around the perimeter of the pit, with another dog in the center. (This is, in fact, somewhat reminiscent of the treatment given to a group of six human burials at Rabbit Island on the Middle Columbia [Crabtree 1957; Schulting 1995:110-111]). Other dogs were placed singly in pits, and one skull was found in a pit (Dumond and Minor 1983:116). In other parts of the Plateau, Collier et al. (1942:43) and Smith (1900:439) report the inclusion of dog skulls with human burials. Clearly something quite unusual was occurring on the Plateau in relation to dogs. Why would eight dog skulls be kept and then ultimately buried? Why kill six dogs and then elaborately bury them? Why leave dogs or dog skulls in the center of house floors upon abandonment? A sim- ilar role for dogs appears to have existed on the Northwest Coast as well (Cybulski 1992:83; 74 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="25">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU Arnoud Stryd, personal communication 1994). Whatever the answer, we feel that there is a good chance that dogs were closely associated with elites-if only because relatively wealthy people would be the ones who could afford to feed dogs and maintain them in their households and sacri- fice them in prestige displays. In general, it is estimated that families in the Northwest had to supply at least a kilogram of salmon to each dog on a daily basis (Hewes 1973:140). Dogs might have acted to protect their owners or their prop- erty and certainly seemed to aid in hunting-a benefit but also an extravagance. On occasion, they may have been killed and eaten at special feasts (some evidence for eating dogs is found at sites on the Canadian Plateau [e.g., Antiquus 1994:130]). Dogs also would be very obvious objects of public display and seem to have been an integral part of the elite complex of accou- trements at certain echelons. Plateau Ideology: Guardian Spirit Power, Myth, and Death The Plateau as a whole shared similar beliefs in guardian spirit power (Anastasio 1972; Ray 1939). Considerable ethnographic evidence shows that attempts were made to maintain spe- cific guardian spirit powers within certain high- status families (see summary in Schulting 1995). The arrangement of marriages between elites of different communities would ensure that a shared set of ideas and possibly even specific spirit pow- ers were promulgated among high-status families throughout the region. Plateau ideology is also united by a body of myth centered around the culture hero Coyote who would not allow coastal transformer spirits to operate in the interior (Teit 1912a:295, 1912b:288). Similar oral traditions existed over much of the Plateau. For example, nearly identi- cal myths involving cannibal ogresses with vagina dentata vanquished by Coyote are found in Shoshone (Pavesic and Studebaker 1993:53), Wishram (Strong 1959:50), Shuswap (Teit 1909:650), Thompson (Teit 1912a:366), and Nicola (Teit 1917:17) oral traditions. Recall that these myths occur in at least three quite different language families. Other Coyote stories in The Dalles vicinity are the same as those of the Thompson and other Plateau groups (Boas 1898:13, 15). While the guardian spirit quest and certain oral traditions were widely disseminated throughout the Plateau, possibly regardless of the status of the communities, it is argued here that the highest levels of understanding were more restricted, specifically to high-status families (cf. York et al. 1993:227; see also Earle 1990). Thus the elite of widely separated communities may have shared in esoteric knowledge denied to the more common members of their respective communities. Moreover, this knowledge could have been at least partially communicated nonverbally through meaningful designs incorporated onto elite arti- facts. Specific designs relating to guardian spirit power were known to have been placed onto important tools, such as digging-stick handles and weapons (Sanger 1968a; Teit 1900). Similarities have also been noted between the rock art of The Dalles area and that of south-central British Columbia (for example, the "rayed arc" human figure) (Keyser 1992:57-87). Mortuary behavior, since it is often associated with elite status display, is another area that can be profitably examined for evidence of interac- tion. The burial practices of the Plateau peoples are highly varied (Schulting 1995; Sprague 1967) and are largely distinct from those of the sur- rounding regions. The variation that exists within the Plateau, however, seems to be related less to regional differences than to temporal change and to socioeconomic status distinctions (Schulting 1995). Cremation was a dominant form of burial near The Dalles during the Late Prehistoric period and extended for some distance upriver (Garth 1952; Strong 1959; Strong et al. 1930); while rare, cremation also occurs in south-central British Columbia (Richards and Rousseau 1987; Smith 1900). Talus burials are common through- out the Plateau where suitable slopes exist. More striking is the occurrence of wooden plank cist burials. This distinctive burial form is found along the lower reaches of the Middle Columbia, including The Dalles (Crabtree 1957; Osborne et al. 1961; Strong et al. 1930), on the Upper Columbia (Collier et al. 1942), in the Okanagan (Caldwell 1954), and along the Fraser River (Pokotylo et al. 1987; Sanger 1961). Moreover, 75</page><page sequence="26">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY very similar funerary ceremonies seem to be involved, including the burning of the portion of the planks left above ground, possibly in conjunc- tion with the burning of grave offerings. Synthesis All elites need to distance themselves from more ordinary community members. They purposefully undertake actions that will place themselves in special positions emphasizing their abilities to acquire items and accomplish things that ordinary people cannot. Elites seek to control resources for their own benefit and to reduce access by others to those resources. They seek to obtain exotic items through trade, travel, and privileged con- tacts (e.g., the "trading partnerships" of the Plateau). Elites seek to produce highly crafted, labor-intensive prestige objects that ordinary indi- viduals would have great difficulty in acquiring. Elites seek out other elites-through trade and intermarriage-who have similar attitudes and goals, and they establish symbiotic relationships whereby each supplies others in the group with exotic materials and esoteric knowledge that can be used to impress or engage people in their respective communities through contractual reci- procal feasting or other means (Hayden 1995). On the regional scale, elites form fraternities in which the ability to acquire and properly use certain symbols and rituals is a prerequisite for member- ship (Brumfiel and Earle 1987). Because of this broad regional integration, there develops a need for comparable measures of prestige for exchange (Earle 1990:74). The elite of various communities form ties outside their kin groups as a means of expanding their influence and power beyond that of the kin-based unit (McGuire 1992; Schortman and Urban 1988). We would argue that this is the real underlying force behind the formation of the Plateau Interaction Sphere and other similar transegalitarian interaction spheres in the world such as the Northwest European Neolithic inter- action sphere. Sherratt (1990) and Lewis- Williams and Dowson (1993:59-62) have discussed some of the dynamics involved in the generation of these interaction sphere ideologies and art styles, and their interpretatoins are gener- ally similar to ours. Given this model, the richest, most powerful communities on the Plateau should have the greatest similarities in prestige goods and styles. On the other hand, communities at the poor end of the spectrum should exhibit a much smaller range of these items and many of the stylistic traits might be aberrant. If we turn to the ethnographic record, there is ample evidence for considerable inequalities between communities in terms of wealth and power and socioeconomic standing. It is apparent that marked differences in inequality existed on the Plateau ranging from the extreme stratification associated with the richest fishing and trading groups, such as the Wishram, Umatilla, Canyon Shuswap, and Lillooet, to extreme egalitarian communities lacking slavery, such as the Sanpoil, Spokane, Kalispel, and the eastern Shuswap (Curtis 1911; Ray 1932, 1939; Spier and Sapir 1930; Spinden 1964; Teit 1900, 1906:254, 1909:576). Similarly, in the richer communities, important resource locations such as fishing sites were owned by corporate groups, and private property was a strong cultural value (Cressman 1960:35; Romanoff 1992a; Spier and Sapir 1930; Teit 1900:293-294, 1906:255-256), while among the more egalitarian communities a sharing ethic prevailed (Ray 1939:25). At The Dalles, ownership of fishing sites was hereditary and six to 10 men usually held the rights jointly (Curtis 1911:95; Spier and Sapir 1930:175). At Keatley Creek, we interpret the unusually large prehistoric housepits as expressions of residential corporate groups, which probably held rights to the most productive fishing locations that were administered by household lineage heads or "chiefs." In the richest Plateau localities, elite sta- tus was hereditary and slavery was prominent. These localities also had the highest population concentrations on the Plateau (Kroeber 1939:138), a variable that has been strongly correlated with sociocultural complexity. Given these factors and the general model of interaction spheres, it should come as no surprise that the distribution of the prestige items (Figures 1-3, 5, 10, 13) suggested to have been part of the Plateau Interaction Sphere clearly demonstrates that most of these items were more concentrated in the two richest fishing and trading localities of the Plateau: The Dalles locality on the Columbia River and the Lillooet-Lytton locality on the 76 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="27">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU Fraser River. Some occurrences also arise at sec- ondary centers of surplus salmon production, such as the Snake River confluence with the Columbia River, Kettle Falls, the Adams River at Shuswap Lake, and the Chilcotin River conflu- ence with the Fraser River; however, the pattern that is most salient in all of these distributions is the clustering of occurrences separated by signif- icant large blank zones. It might be argued that for some items origi- nating on the coast, such as shells (Figure 1) and whalebone, or that have sources mainly in the coastal mountain ranges such as copper (Figure 3), the concentrations at The Dalles and Lillooet- Lytton are due simply to their greater proximity to these sources and that the overall distributions on the Plateau represent nothing more than distance- decay from the sources along the major prehis- toric routes of access to the coast (the Columbia Valley and the Anderson-Seton-Lillooet Lake sys- tem). While this factor undoubtedly played some role in creating the distributions of these materi- als, examination of other materials not related to coastal origins shows essentially the same type of distribution. There are no known sources of nephrite near the Columbia River; most nephrite sources are in the Lillooet region. Yet nephrite artifacts cluster at The Dalles and other important Middle Columbia River centers. This distribution exhibits a "polar" characteristic consistent with the use of nephrite in communities with relatively powerful elites, but not in intervening areas with elites of less wealth and power (Figure 2). In a recent study, Darwent (1996) documents this polar distributional characteristic in greater detail for the Canadian Plateau, where it is clear that major concentrations of nephrite occur at 0-50, 100-150, 200-250, and 500-550 km from the nephrite sources with little in intervening areas. Moreover, while a wide range of nephrite adze sizes occurs at sites within 50 km of the nephrite sources, the longer size adzes predominate at many of the more distant sites, emphasizing their role as trade and status items. Digging-stick handles, tubular stone pipes, and bone gaming pieces (Figures 5, 10, and 13) all were made from materials widely available on the Plateau. Yet their distributions display as pro- nounced a polar clustering as dentalia and nephrite artifacts, especially around the Lillooet- Lytton and The Dalles localities as well as a few secondary centers. Although not illustrated here, the distribution of obsidian artifacts, whalebone clubs, L-shaped awls, serrated points or curvilin- ear pendants, and chipped-stone eccentrics dis- play similar clustering. In all of these unillustrated cases (as well as marine shell arti- facts), the clustering of occurrences is even more highly concentrated around the Lillooet-Lytton and The Dalles localities than the materials shown in Figures 2, 5, 10, and 13 (nephrite, digging-stick handles, gaming pieces, and pipes). While we have not quantified the elaborate use of dogs, styles of stone sculpture, or carved grave markers, we feel that there is a strong case to be made for these, and possibly many more traits, as also con- forming to this same polar distributional pattern (Dawson 1891:10; Strong et al. 1930:121; Teit 1906). This pattern is pronounced enough and duplicated in so many different types of prestige goods that it constitutes very strong support for the elite-based model of the Plateau Interaction Sphere that we have proposed. In fact, the most important Plateau centers might even be por- trayed in terms resembling Polyani's (1963) Ports of Trade (cf. Cannon 1992 and Cressman 1960) or Jackson's (1991) trade fair sites. To some degree, elite artifacts from the broader Plateau tradition should be found wherever salmon permitted com- munities to acquire, store, and exchange sur- pluses, even on an occasional basis. However, the major centers for wealth should be much more closely connected to each other in terms of elite styles and artifacts than they are to intervening poorer communities. The ethnographic literature further supports the general model outlined above. While we do not suggest that there was an "elite merchant class" (as one reviewer had supposed), the rich and powerful elites do appear to have been far more heavily involved in the long-distance exchange of prestige goods than poor or non-elite individuals, and rich elites did try to concentrate access to prestige goods in their own hands. There is little doubt about the widespread movement of elite and possibly other wealthy traders on the Plateau. Simon Fraser saw Yakima Indians near Lillooet in 1808 (Smith 1910:144), and Teit 77</page><page sequence="28">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (1930:121) notes that "large, well-armed and well-equipped" parties of Wenatchi and Columbia Indians traveled annually to The Dalles. Spier and Sapir (1930:225) add that Nespelem and Spokan would also travel to The Dalles. Unfortunately, most ethnographers do not provide profiles of precisely who carried out such trade. Still, there is some information available. Teit (1909:576) observed that the upper classes of some groups on the Canadian Plateau had special trading privi- leges. These privileges may have been held on behalf of supporting corporate groups, but they were clearly aspects that elites tried to control as well. Spier and Sapir (1930:225) note that it was only chiefs and shamans who came from Lower Columbia groups to trade at The Dalles. Cline et al. (1938:74) state that a Sinkaietk chief con- ducted frequent trading expeditions across the Cascades to obtain highly valued marine shells. Cressman (1960:40), Cline et al. (1938), and Romanoff(1992a:253) note that intervillage trade was carried out by "trading friends," who estab- lished special relationships with each other. A special trade language, derived from a mod- ified version of Wishram Chinook, was in use throughout much of the Plateau in the early his- toric period, and it makes sense that knowledge of this "trade jargon" would have been largely restricted to the elites who were so heavily involved in the long-distance trade of prestige items (Teit 1906:202, 231-232). The "high" lan- guages of the Lillooet and the Okanagan were only used by high-ranking individuals (Desmond Peters, Sr., personal communication 1994; Hudson 1994) and appear to have functioned on the Canadian Plateau in a fashion similar to Chinook on the Columbia Plateau. These "high" languages may even have contained a strong admixture of Chinook words. Significantly, Chinook was spoken better by the Lillooet than any other Interior group (Teit 1906:202). Presumably, it was the elites that knew this lan- guage. The emphasis on speaking Chinook in Lillooet communities highlights their central role in trade and parallels the bipolar similarity of elite material items between The Dalles and the Lytton-Lillooet regions previously documented. Plateau ethnographers have also noted the strong tendency for high-ranking families to inter- marry between communities and with trading partners (Wood 1980:105). A similar pattern has also been documented for the Coast (Rosman and Rubel 1971:72, 144; Sproat 1987:72) and is possi- bly a general characteristic of all complex transe- galitarian societies (Hayden 1995). In many Plateau groups, conscious efforts were made by elite families to arrange marriages so as to main- tain and increase their wealth and social standing (Curtis 1911:89; Nastich 1954; Ray 1932:137-139; Spier and Sapir 1930:217; Teit 1900:325, 1909:591-592). And even where an effort to arrange marriages between social equals was not explicitly made (or recognized as such by informants), the common practice of reciprocal gift exchange certainly acted to encourage the marriage of socioeconomic equals (Curtis 1911:50; Spier and Sapir 1930:217-218). Related to this, the elite were also far more likely to seek marriage alliances outside their communities (Spier and Sapir 1930:217). These features again emphasize the mutual regional involvement and exclusive frateralistic tendencies of elite families. Finally, to return to our point of departure, the Plateau Interaction Sphere, it may well be asked to what extent this was really a distinctive phenome- non, especially since many artifacts like dentalia and other marine shell beads, dogs, and ground- stone artifacts were shared with coastal groups. Indeed, manifestation of the Plateau Interaction Sphere could be expected to be far stronger were it not for the great distance separating the two most highly developed areas-The Dalles and Lytton-Lillooet-particularly since the interven- ing region can be characterized as largely lacking in communities displaying equivalent levels of socioeconomic complexity. This in conjunction with the relative proximity and ease of access to the materially wealthy groups of the lower Columbia and Fraser rivers, and through them the groups of the Northwest Coast proper, meant that much of the focus of the Plateau elite on these two rivers was directed downstream. This provides another level of interaction, one involving both the Plateau and the Northwest Coast. This is not sur- prising-one might well expect elites to seek con- federates appropriate to their own degree of development no matter what environmental zone they happened to live in (cf. Flannery's [1968] 78 [Vol. 62, No. 1, 1997</page><page sequence="29">Hayden and Schulting] CULTURAL INTERACTION ON THE LATE PREHISTORIC PLATEAU ideas on Olmec-Oaxacan interaction). However, it also seems that the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges created enough of an impediment to travel (or that basic adaptations to different environments created distinctive enough backgrounds) leading to somewhat separate inter- action spheres on the Northwest Coast and on the Plateau. Some artifact types on the Plateau are extremely rare or do not occur at all in most Northwest Coast regions, and vice versa. These include chipped eccentrics, serrated and curvilin- ear pendants, digging-stick handles, L-shaped awls, incised dentalia, incised bear bacula pen- dants (Sanger 1968a:121), tubular stone pipes (very rare on the coast), and, in the protohistoric period, a distinctive regalia utilizing tubular cop- per beads and dentalia beads (see Chance and Chance 1985), as well as an elite trade language. Geometric and naturalistic sculptural and rock art styles on the Plateau (vs. form-line and Raven motifs on the Northwest Coast) are also very dif- ferent and distinctive, as are differences in mythic characters (Coyote vs. Raven) and language. As Anastasio (1985) and Wood (1980:105) argue, the Plateau formed a single social network that Ames (1991:940) views as much more culturally unified than the more balkanized coastal groups. Thus, not only is it possible to speak of a Plateau Interaction Sphere, but it is also reason- able to search for its origins in the development of socioeconomic inequality and elites on the Plateau and their need for exotic goods and con- federates in their attempts to attain and consoli- date their positions of influence and power. It is recognized that the emergent interaction sphere described here was developed only to a moderate degree. But it is precisely this type of situation that allows for study of the means by which more elaborate-and hence easily recognized-sys- tems develop. One of the important questions that remains to be addressed is that of the timing of the emergence of the Plateau Interaction Sphere. It should be possible to develop an index of the intensity of interaction and apply it in a diachronic study. The identification and tabula- tion of prestige materials and crafted items across the Plateau is the first step in any such analysis, and we hope that the present contribution will facilitate investigations along these lines.
