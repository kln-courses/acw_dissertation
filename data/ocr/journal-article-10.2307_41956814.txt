<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Gray and Robert Adamson - A Dialectical Study of Late Australian Romanticism ANGUS NICHOLLS Robert Gray and Robert Adamson are two of the most prolific and honored poets writing in Aus- tralia today. But from where does their poetry come and to where is it leading? I would argue that both Gray and Adamson are, in different ways, exponents of a late Australian Romanti- cism. In developing this view I will also respond to and develop some of the arguments outlined by Paul Kane in his book, Australian Poetry: Roman- ticism and Negativity (1996). The Question of Australian Romanticism. The debate as to whether Romanticism has existed in Australian poetry has tended to be couched in linear or chronological terms. The chronological argument is ostensibly a simple one; that is, Australia was settled during the height of European Romanticism, which is usually seen as roughly encompassing the period between 1789 and the early 1830s. Colonial Australians, it is argued, were in no position to reflect upon the values of the Enlightenment, which so trou* bled European Romantics, nor were they able to con- template a fusion between the self and nature, consid- ering that the Australian habitat was so foreign to white European sensibilities. Andrew Taylor in Read- ing Australian Poetry , says that by the time Australian poetry began to establish itself through poets like Charles Harpur, the influence of Romantics like Wordsworth was waning in the face of a rising Victo- rianism exemplified by Tennyson and Arnold, among others (30). I wish to work in opposition to this model by construing Romanticism as a trans-historical sensi- bility or mode of perception, which need not be Standing Figure (crayon) Drawing by Robert Gray, from Lineations ANTIPODES • 103</page><page sequence="2">confined to a specific historical period or set of socio- political causes. Paul Kane's Australian Poetry: Romant- icism and Negativity expands upon this view by following an essentially Hegelian dialectical argument with regard to the possibility of Romanticism in Australia. Kane argues that the apparent absence of Romanti- cism in the Australian literary tradition paradoxically generated a "preoccupation with the forms of Roman- ticism" and a situation in which "poets sought to recompense this loss or lack by creating a belated romanticism grounded in absence or negativity" (4*5). In outlining such an argument, Kane employs the Hegelian notion of Aufhebung , or sublation, in which the existence of a certain state of affairs (in this case an absence of Romanticism in Australia) can be seen to posit the existence of its "other" (that is, the pres- ence of Romanticism) by way of a negative movement. Kane points to Australian poets like Charles Harpur, Christopher Brennan, Kenneth Slessor, A. D. Hope, and Gwen Harwood, among others, to support his argument. Whether or not one agrees with his analy- sis of these figures, the chief importance of his book lies first in its positing of a late Australian Romanti- cism outside of the usual time-frame of its European counterpart, and second - and more importantly - in its recognition of the central role of dialectics in Romantic theory. The central dialectic in Romanticism is that of Romantic perception, which operates, within the rubric of Kantianism, as an interchange between the self and nature, or subject and object. The notion of Romanticism as a relation between the self and nature is particularly apposite with respect to Australia. In the late twentieth century, Europe (the original site of Romanticism) has become a mere garden, and often a polluted one at that, while Australia remains an example of relatively unkempt and untainted nature. The crucial issue within this dialectic is the question of whether the natural world can be said to exist as an objective sphere independently of human subjectivity, or to what extent natural phenomena are supple- mented by, or, in a more extreme version, created by, human consciousness. Most theorists of Romanticism would still agree with M. H. Abrams that the content of Romantic perception is comprised of "a bilateral transaction, a give-and-take, between mind and external object" (61). Abrams's notion would appear to be a version of Coleridge's "coalesecence of subject and object," which is essentially an Anglicized form of Kantian idealism, the central point being that there is some form of supplementation, or subjective participation in the processes of perception, and that this subjective element is also present in poetic language. Leaving aside the subject/object dialectic, we may also find another dualism at play in post-war Australian Poetry, which could also lead us in the direction of uncovering a late Australian Romanti- cism. I refer here to the apparent and oft-noted "split" in Australian poetry, which took place during the late 1960s and still holds some kind of sway. By this I mean the division between the group of poets who followed 104 • DECEMBER 1997 the poetic sensibilities of the American New School (that is, Ashbery, O'Hara, Berrigan, and so on) and those who followed more traditional and perhaps nature-oriented poetics of American Romantics like Whitman and later imagists like Williams and Pound, the Black Mountain School, and the Vitalist or Materialist tradition in Australian poetry, seen most obviously in Kenneth Slessor and Judith Wright. In the first group one might include poets like John Tranter, John Forbes, and Gig Ryan, in the latter, Robert Gray and Les Murray. Robert Adamson is difficult to place in either group, and may in some way represent a fusion of the two. My interest lies in placing Robert Gray and Robert Adamson within the dialectical frame of Romanticism. Both are eminently concerned with depicting the natural world and both are examples of a late Australian Romanticism; however, their poetic approaches to the natural world are quite distinct. Gray's ostensible project is to record nature in the most objective form possible within the realm of poetic language, while Adamson's project is to depict nature through an eminently subjective lens, in keeping with a more radical Romanticism. Gray and Adamson may also be seen to occupy the two disparate "poles" of post-war Australian poetry. Gray has quite explicitly aligned himself against "New School" poets like Forbes and Tranter, while Adamson has shown an increasing willingness to deal with the forces of post- modernism and poststructuralism, which found expres- sion in New School poets like John Ashbery. These differing approaches to nature and to poetry - made by two poets who are contemporaries of one another - may also be seen to comprise a dialectical relation crucial to an understanding of Late Australian Romanticism. Robert Gray and " Repressed Romanticism" Robert Gray is a poet who has shown a surprising willingness to discuss the meaning of his work and its philosophical background. Without delving too deeply into the issue of psychoanalysis and its various appli- cations to literature, it should at the outset be said that most statements made by an artist on his or her work ought to be viewed with at least a healthy skepticism, if not downright suspicion. Having said this, Gray's stated poetic philosophy can roughly be seen as a fusion of Materialism and areas of Zen Buddhism sympathetic to the materialist cause, along with a ten- dency toward immanentist or anti-Platonic elements in German philosophy, seen most clearly in the work of Martin Heidegger. In an interview in Southerly , Gray outlines his philosophical position, which amounts to a rigid anti-Platonism, by arguing that all existence is flux and that consequently . . . there can be no Essence, in anything, or anywhere. There is no self, no soul, no God. Nature is a self existent system, in which things transform themselves through interaction. There is no Centre to it, there is no Higher Reality</page><page sequence="3">Robert Gray beyond, because things can only exist in the way that they actually do exist - in space and time, and plurally. (30) Aligned with this philosophical perspective is Gray's professed allegiance to a poetic heritage also con- cerned with notions of natural immanence and a pref- erence for objectivity. In an essay on American poetry, Gray professes his admiration for Whitman, but - more importantly - for Objectivist poets like William Carlos Williams and Charles Remikoff (Kirkby 117). Another influence on Gray is the pre- dominantly American school of Imagism, a poetics associated with Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, Williams, and H.D., among others. The significance of Gray's Imagist tendencies for this discussion lies in the fact that Imagism was a modernist movement, which pitted itself explicitly against Romanticism and all its Platonist and Neo-Platonist trappings. Imagism grew chiefly out of the Vitalist philoso- phy of Henri Bergson. In his book, Matter and Mem- ory, Bergson opposed the Kantian dualism (essential to Romanticism) of Sense and Understanding by propos- Robert Adamson ing a new form of direct perception of natural objects based on intuition, which, he argued, could operate independently of the intellect and Kant's categorical imperative. In Bergson's schema, the mind is like an organism, a predominantly passive receiver of stimuli from the surrounding environment. For Gray, such a philosophy also resembles Buddhist notions of discard- ing the self or ego in order to experience the full immanence of being: an immanence in which the unity between inner and outer, between man and nature, is restored. This position comprises a crucial departure from Coleridge's "coalescence of subject and object" derived from Kant and adopted by the Roman- tic tradition, in which the natural world is supple- mented by human consciousness. This departure is most fully realized in Pound's famous Imagist state- ment, "No ideas but in things," and in his idea that "the natural object is always the adequate symbol"; that is, the notion that the driving poetic force is the objective outside, and that poetry should be comprised of a precise, although intuitive, rendering of empirical objects without the attendant subjectivity associated with Romanticism. ANTIPODES • 105</page><page sequence="4">Gray in "Curriculum Vitae" concurs with this approach by describing how his mind first opened, like a bubble from a glass- blower's tube, and shone, reflecting things as they are - (New and Selected Poems 155) For Gray the mind is like a passive receiver of natural phenomena, the mind as mirror and not as lamp. In an earlier and highly aphoristic poem titled "At the Inlet," Gray also insists, in keeping with his professed materialism, that "nature maintains itself without my concurrence; before / it all my subjectivity has no standing and is dissolved. In taking / it to myself, I find an incomparable satisfaction (New and Selected Poems 144). Here Gray is at his didactic worst; there is a decided lack of subtlety in such statements, a poetic dogmatism that is perhaps indicative of something contradictory operating deeper in his sensibility. Initially, we can see in Gray's poetry that desire for "the ontological status of the object" outlined by de Man as the central characteristic of the Romantic image ("The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" 7). For de Man, the Romantic mode excels in the use of symbols - the projection of subjective cate- gories on to the objective world, which attempts to create "an intimate unity between the image that rises up before the senses and the supersensory (or tran- scendent) totality that the image suggests" ("The Rhetoric of Temporality" 189). Ostensibly working against de Man's romantic model, Gray's preferred mode is that of likenesses, achieved by the use of similes. Dennis Haskell has observed that "Gray's poems characteristically use simile rather than metaphor, in order to allow the objects employed their own nature" (261). This pref- erence may be seen to work in harmony with Gray's program of poetic objectivity, in that similes do not apparently change the objects perceived; rather they point to likenesses with something else, whereas the romantic mode of the symbol arises out of a fusion between perce i ver and object. One can point to any number of such similes in Gray's work: the forest - "like a cupboard, in some deserted room, with its door ajar" (18); a dark line of bush - "a crowd of emigrants at the rail" (65); the sky - "pale, like a butcher's clean shirt" (134) New and Selected Poems. All of this may remind us of Pound's "In the Station of a Metro": "The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet black bough," which is perhaps the most famous Imagist poem. The point here is that Gray tries to reveal nature to us by way of disjunctions or juxtapositions, similes that at first appear to be completely incongruous, but then proceed to give us a flash of recognition and a supposed identi- fication with the immanent object in itself. This would all be fine if Gray's depiction of nature was not so deeply grounded in his own subjectivity. Through Gray's use of simile, we are not given "objective 106 • DECEMBER 1997 nature"; rather, we see nature as it appears to Gray subjectively. Gray seems to forget the fact that liken- ing a certain object to something else is also a way of changing it, and of stamping upon it the poet's subjec- tivity. Indeed, at times Gray's subjectivity verges on surrealism. Not surprisingly, another of Gray's apho- risms in "At the Inlet" runs: "the surrealists, who sought the Marvellous, that is hidden somewhere within us, have produced / only the grotesque. How detestable, their facile sacrifice of the beauty which things have - (New and Selected Poems 144). If we return here to Kane's idea of negativity, we may conclude that, in many cases, Gray's denials may tell us more about him than do his affirmations. In his attempts at Buddhist lack of ego, Gray appears to find only his ego in magnified form. Although he professes to adhere to Heidegger's notion of "Being," a mode of existence that requires no process of reflection, or separation of "Essences" from phenomena, his poetics are, by contrast, decidedly Kantian. Gray requires categories, metaphors, similes in which to reflect the natural world and these inevitably come from his own mind, and, like Kant's categorical imperative, operate by fusing the subjective with the objective. His poetry is perhaps less like that of objec- tivists such as Williams and Reznikoff, and more like that of Whitman's high Romanticism, a poetry in which everything in nature says something about the self. Gray is quite comfortable with "being himself' in his autobiographical poems like "Poem to my Father" and "Diptych," but his best work lies in his nature poetry - a poetry that deals with his attempt to tran- scend the self and rests upon the tension between the ego and nature, a tension that is the hallmark of his late Romanticism. In his latest volume, Lineations , Gray appears to have come to terms with this previously internalized Romanticism. The poetry in Lineations is accompanied by Gray's drawings, which are far from the kind of realism we might expect, in light of his preference for objectivity. Although spare, Gray's drawings are highly expressionist, as is the poetry in Lineations. In previous volumes, it was common for Gray to give precise and involved descriptions of natural phenom- ena without relating those images back to the feelings of a consciousness or speaker in a way similar to Keats or Wordsworth; rather, the anthropomorphic element was either hidden or muted, but nevertheless present. In an article on Gray's Objectivist stance, Alan Urquart noted an apparent "rebellion against the technique of impersonal observation," which he saw as registering a "realisation by the poet that such objectivity can never be objectively 'objective' but simply another mask or pose" (45). An example of this new tendency in Gray appears in "A Pine Forest" from Lineations : In Autumn windows, evening's land of ebony and fire. Out there stand the pines, shingled on the valley; and cold rises off them early, exhales across the axe-carved hills.</page><page sequence="5">Bare Trees (pencil) Drawing by Robert Gray, from Lineations Above this now a liquor swirls in the clear glass of dusk, that's lit already with a small starlight for highlights - the fiery water is brandished, reflects a grandeur beyond here, or a roaring wassail, mostly likely, chaotic, brutal. These pines I gaze on arouse disquiet in me. In early hours, while staying here, I walk among them, every day in a damp chasm, a gloom. Insurgent in this country, they're alien. "The Ghost of a Flea," Blake's drawing of his monstrous vision, comes to mind. On television One saw the origin of that trope - they showed within the microscope demonic fleas and other mites. The quiet trees recall such parasites for me. (31) This poem bears all the marks of high Romanticism. The poet is gloomy for a particular reason; the pines, in comparison with native Eucalypts, represent a de- natured nature, an aberration in nature's self-depen- dent immanence. This brings to mind Blake's etching "The Ghost of a Flea," an otherworldly vision that is supplemented by the poet's memories of microscopic images of such parasites seen on television. The fleas themselves are "demonic"; the demonic - or daemonic (dämonische) - is a commonplace of Romanticism and represents the hidden principle of causation or fate; it is also often seen as semi-divine, although irrational, and was commonly pointed to as the cause of evil in nature, or tragedy in human lives. In light of the demonic, nature is no longer a harmonious system of immanent Being; rather it is subject to a higher, though unknown, cause. The demonic is also similar to the Freudian unheimlich , or uncanny, which Freud defines as some- thing both familiar and yet strangely frightening, and which usually corresponds with the resurfacing of hitherto repressed images or thoughts (219). Just as Blake's uncanny "Ghost of a Flea" resurfaces in Gray's poem, so too does Blake's presence in "A Pine Forest" point to Gray's latent (and often repressed) Romanti- cism. Gray's ostensible project is usually a kind of studied materialism, but here he indulges in a kind of naturalist mysticism, and the effect that these aberrant natural images have on the poet recalls Coleridge's Dejection: An Ode, as an example of Romantic melancholia. Gray's reference to Blake, perhaps the most radical and otherworldly of all English Romantics, would also appear to be some kind of recognition of his own late Romanticism. ANTIPODES • 107</page><page sequence="6">Robert Adamson and Explicit Romanticism It is useful to begin a discussion of Adamson and his relation to Gray by referring to a review written by Adamson, which appeared in New Poetry, of Gray's volume Grass Script. Adamson's complaint with the earlier Gray is essentially the same as my own. Adamson asks: "... where's Gray ... I kept waiting for Gray to jump down from his high horse and throw himself into the mud. Plunge his hands into the rot, to come up with some of the earth from his North Coast, fecund, in a clump and clinging to his flesh with blood worms oozing through" (67). Adamson, himself an explicitly Romantic and strongly subjective poet, argues that there is an essen- tial emptiness to Gray's work and its aesthetic of detached description. Adamson wants to see "the indi- vidual's mark, the original vision"; that is, he wants to see nature depicted subjectively, in terms of a dialectic cal relation between the self and the landscape, a relation that has its heart in Romanticism. Adamson argues that the key line in Gray's work is one that appears in the long poem "Dharma Vehicle": "I do not want to be what I am" ( New and Selected Poems 75). This is indicative of Gray's earlier attempts to over- come his own consciousness. Adamson, by contrast, wants to be nothing other than himself. This tendency is apparent especially in his early work, which is largely autobiographical, and concerns the time he spent in and out of the New South Wales prison system, and his various dabbling into petty crime and drug experimentation. As a result of these preoccu- pations, Adamson has tended to align himself, especially in his early work, with like-minded "decadent" romantics like Arthur Rimbaud, and, more recently, the twentieth-century American poet Hart Crane. This strain of Romanticism is not so much con- cerned with objective nature, as with a thematic concern with the self and, especially in the case of Crane, a return to mythic consciousness. Unlike Gray, Adamson has also shown a willingness to embrace the sensibilities of modernism and postmodernism; this was evidenced in his involvement with New Poetry magazine throughout the 1970s, a magazine that more or less embraced the poetics of the American New School and the Black Mountain poetics of Charles Olson and Robert Creeley, among others. I am interested in looking at Adamson's poetry as being indicative of where Romanticism might be likely to go in light of postmodernism and the age of multimedia. Adamson grapples with this question most directly in his latest volume, Waving to Hart Crane . Before turning to Adamson's poetry, I would like to consider briefly Hart Crane and the ideas that informed his large group of poems, published in 1930, titled The Bridge. Many saw, and still see, The Bridge as an attempt made by Crane to re-mythologize twentieth-century poetry in the wake of T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland. Although its significance has been exaggerated, this view of Crane is, in part, correct; Crane did attempt 108 • DECEMBER 1997 to achieve a new American mythology by making thematic the modernist architecture of New York (especially that of the Brooklyn Bridge) and by fusing images of modern America with the older, organic mythologies of the Americas, ancient Greece, and high Romanticism. Crane's mode is essentially Orphic; that is, he sees the poetic act as a thematic representation of Orpheus' s descent into the underworld, a descent made, with the assistance of verse and music, in order to recover life (and presence) in the form of Euridyce. Orpheus is also related to Satan, and particularly to Milton's version of Satan in Paradise Lost , as the poet who descends into the abyss in order to find a new ground on which to base his existence. In this respect Crane's bridge, with its many stays and strings, resembles both the lyre of Orpheus, and the attempt made by poetry to bridge or fuse the contrary elements of Romanticism: the subjective and the objective. For Crane, the role of the Bridge, and by analogy the role of poetry, was to "lend a myth to God," to operate as a mode of divination grounded in subjectivity. The ability of poetry to "lend a myth to God" paradoxically requires God's negation, so that creative space can be opened up for the poet to propose a new mythology. In Waving to Hart Crane , Adamson touches on this idea in two "experimental" poems, "Lozenge for Brennan" and "Lozenge for Mondrian." In "Lozenge for Brennan," Adamson asserts that "THE BLANK SPACES SPEAK ACROSS / SPACE" and that the "POET OF LIFE LIVES IN GOD'S DEATH" (6), while in "Lozenge for Mondrian" he argues that "WORDS BECOME TRUTHS / WHILE POETRY IS GOD OF THE HEAD" (7). In philosophical terms, such ideas can be seen as approaching Nietzschean notions that the absence created by the death of God may operate as a form of creative space in which art may propose itself as a form of subjectively mediated ontological truth. Significantly, to negate God is also to remove the notion that the natural world is God's creation. Accordingly, we get the sense that Adamson's natural world is his own, a subjective landscape in the tradi- tions of Wordsworth and Whitman. This tendency is seen more strongly in the volume that precedes Waving to Hart Crane , titled The Clean Dark. Adamson's muse is the Hawkesbury River, and The Clean Dark maps the Hawkesbury as a repre- sentation of the poet's soul, in a world where inner and outer have become indistinguishable. In the poem "The Speaking Page" the river is like: a blank page you enter it differently: shape it as you would a new thought first vaguely with phrases then sentences until finally it's language (37)</page><page sequence="7">of course it's imagination weaving the river song, your mind's invention is playing you as the tide begins to ebb (38) Landscape is, for Adamson, a form of writing, and writing a form of landscape. This is the kind of fusion between the mind and nature indicative of Coleridge's "coalesecence of subject and object" - a fusion in which, according to de Man, "it becomes difficult to distinguish between object and image, between imagi' nation and perception" in what amounts to an "amai' gamation of perception and reverie" ("The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" 7). Such a fusion is something like what Crane attempted in The Bridge, which carries with it the notion that poetry can be a kind of divination or theology, albeit a negative one. Adamson hits directly upon this idea in the poem "Lady Faith" in which he asserts: What makes poetry for me these days of fear is the faith a well made sentence brings about in the song of our being; poetry in these post-modern days of crazes that take philosophers of language like brainstorms, where they mistake language for mathematics; critics gesturing as politicians in some revolutionary state of self delusion, squandering the stakes; what makes a poem tick these days of serious fads, where the muse gets deconstructed like a toy - these days in the names of theory's slaves - again, is the faith that pure song must employ. (59). We hear, behind Adamson's voice, Crane's line "One Song, one Bridge of Fire" in which he praises poetry as being prophetic and resembling a "White" Deity, a religion grounded in negativity. Adamson concurs with Crane at the conclusion of "Lady Faith" by claiming that "formlessness ... in the hands / of a poet, is faith in our own mystery." If this comprises a late Australian Romanticism, then the forces against which such a movement labors are the rationalizing modes of literary theory and their tendency to deaden literature by treating it like a science. If the rise of theory is literature's "Enlightenment," then, it seems, Adamson is aligning himself with the forces of mystery and unreason, and in such a move he harks back to an older Romanticism. The Enlightenment, it appears, has never left us, and so neither has its other, the force of Romanticism. This idea is foregrounded in the title poem of Waving to Hart Crane in which Adamson sees poetry as being pitted against technology. The poem begins: Farewell to the wire, the voices on the line. Goodbye switchboard rider, my American friend. We enter the new century through glass, black oceans and black winds, thin fibre tunnelling poetry out of existence. (27) In this section the "wire" of the first stanza takes on a threefold significance, representing at furthest remove the strings of the Orphic Harp or Lyre, then in turn the wires of Crane's Bridge and its unifying qualities, and finally the wire that, in the postmodern world, is burdened with carrying our many voices. In the third stanza this wire becomes the newer "thin fibre" that carries telephone, television, and internet services, which Adamson sees as "tunnelling poetry out of exis' tence." Just as Crane wrote against T. S. Eliot's pessimism in The Wasteland by attempting to revive Romanticism in The Bridge , so Adamson takes on a similar task in the postmodern age, and what better metaphor is there for the internet than T. S. Eliot's "heap of broken images"? Adamson asserts that "No sonnet will survive / the fax on fire," but his voice in both The Clean Dark and Waving to Hart Crane, is one of defiant Romanticism - a Romanticism all the more virulent in the face of modern technology and the literary rationalizations of Deconstruction and Post' Structuralism. Conclusion I have suggested that Gray and Adamson may be seen to manifest a Late Australian Romanticism, but if such a phenomenon exists, then how would it be defined? Romanticism, in its original form was, among other things, a movement of protest against the Enlighten* ment; Gray and Adamson, belonging as they do to the twentieth century, both work in different ways against an updated and less optimistic form of the Enlighten' ment: namely, Modernism. Gray's anti'modernist strain is largely uncon' scious in that he actually adopted some of the forms of modernism (Imagism, Bergsonism, Heideggerean philosophy) only subsequently to subvert them by depicting an eminently anthropomorphic view of nature. Gray's Romanticism is all the more virulent because of its self'denial, and also because of his project against the postmodernist strain in Australian poetry. By contrast, Adamson works explicitly against modernism by being selfconsciously Romantic; this is seen in his early "cult of personality" autobiographical work, and later in his attempt to further Hart Crane's ANTIPODES • 109</page><page sequence="8">poetic project, a project that essentially manifested itself as a response to (and denial of) the forces of Modernism, embodied for Crane in the work of T.S. Eliot. Adamson's bogeymen are updated forms of the Eliot sensibility: the rise of literary theory, the death of the author (which corresponds roughly with Eliot's High Modernist "Objective Correlative"), and the in' exorable, dehumanizing march of modern technology. If we continue to proceed on the basis that Romanticism is dialectical, it may also be suggested that Gray and Adamson have worked against one another precisely because of their contemporaneity. With this idea in mind, the following facts should be noted: Gray was born in 1945, Adamson in 1943; both have written extensively about Sydney and rural New South Wales. Gray has shunned postmodernism and the New School, while Adamson has, at times, adopted them. Gray's work revolves, at least ostensi- bly, around the delineation of nature by way of a repression of the self; Adamson's around a celebration of the self and poetry through their interaction with nature. Gray's Romanticism is muted, or even repressed, while Adamson's is self-conscious and explicit. What this seems to suggest is that poets often work, whether consciously or not, by responding to the forces of literary history and to their contemporaries, and that some poets may fill the gaps left by others. If, as Paul Kane and Andrew Taylor have suggested, Australia missed the first Romantic boat, then Gray 110 • DECEMBER 1997 and Adamson represent a kind of delayed literary reaction, which is due, in large part, to the fact that much of the Australian bush is still wild enough, still "other" enough, to be romanticized. Gray and Adam- son both take as their subject the dialectic between the self and nature, often working at opposite ends of the scale. In this respect their relation to one another is also a dialectical one: the dialectic of Late Australian Romanticism. WORKS CITED Abrams, M.H. The Mirror and the Lamp.
