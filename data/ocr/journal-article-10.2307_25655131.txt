<plain_text><page sequence="1">'THE FIRE OF HIS EYE': THOMAS, 3RD LORD FAIRFAX'S 'A TREATISE TOUCHING THE BREEDING OF HORSES' His place in the pantheon of illustrious early modern military leaders secure, Thomas, 3rd Lord Fairfax, Commander-in-Chief (1645-50) of parliamentary forces during the English Civil Wars, has by extension long been closely asso ciated with the horse. The abiding visual image of Fairfax is the impressively martial, equestrian portrait engraved by William Marshall after the painting by Edward Bower (1647).1 Unlike Oliver Cromwell, his successor as Supreme Commander, Fairfax was born into a family immersed in the culture and duty of military service.2 The first Lord served as a soldier in the Low Countries dur ing Queen Elizabeth's reign; the second, Ferdinando, Thomas's father, com manded the parliamentary forces in Yorkshire in the latter part of 1642; and Thomas's great uncle, Charles Fairfax, was killed at the Siege of Ostend in 1604. Army service in the early modern period, at least for officers, centred on the cavalry, thus on the horse, and, through the horse, adherence to shared chival ric codes of honour.3 There are further notable equine links with Fairfax. His grandfather, the first Lord, who largely brought him up, expertly bred horses; at the age of seventy six, in 1636, racked with pain from gout and the stone, he still made 'shift in his slippers to walk to ye stable'.4 Thomas Fairfax himself first came to national prominence when on He worth Moor in June 1642 he was almost trampled by Charles I's steed in delivering a petition to the King listing the grievances of the Yorkshire gentry. The following year, after Parliament's capture of Leeds, parliamentarian propagandists conferred on Fairfax the evocative sobriquet of 'the rider of the white horse'. For the pious Fairfax this was a fittingly mil lenarian image drawing on the Book of Revelation, in which the rider sym bolizes Christ's vanquishing power. The epithet reverberates, moreover, with Andrew Marvell's famous contemporary poem 'Upon Appleton House, to my Lord Fairfax' (1651), in which Fairfax, 'as long since prophesied, | His horse through conquered Britain [will] ride'.5 And, in an ironic twist to the Restora tion, with echoes of Roan Barbary in Shakespeare's Richard II6 Charles II was 1 An image reproduced in several modern publications on the Fairfax family.

There is, however, a fur ther, hitherto virtually ignored equine link with Fairfax, one which in turn helps to point up an equally neglected facet of his life: his literary accomplish ments. Fighting and writing, as for many of his peers, were inseparable endea vours in Fairfax's notion of honour. Family expectation is again evident here; successive generations and branches of Fairfaxes had been possessed of the ca coethes scribendi. Thomas's great-uncle Edward had in 1660 translated Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata, and also written, as well as several no longer extant pas toral eclogues, A Discourse of Witchcraft (1621-23).8 His father and grand father had both undertaken metrical Psalm translations. In spite of his own strikingly wide-ranging and diverting literary corpus, however, Thomas Fair fax remains an auctor ignotus. His writings include translations of the Psalms and devotional and secular poetry, as well as translations of an Indian romance and part of the Hermetic corpus; yet few if any of these literary accomplish ments have attracted sustained literary criticism.9 One of the most overlooked of Fairfax's various literary endeavours is a short prose work in his own hand entitled 'A treatise touching the breeding of horses', penned in retirement at his Nun Appleton seat: that is, at some point after June 1650. It was and remains unpublished, and is held at York Minster Library.10 In examining Fairfax's treatise, this essay sits within a much broader re cent academic discourse in which flora and, especially, fauna are being res cued from the margins of Renaissance texts: for example by Karen Edwards's illuminating work on animals in Milton's Paradise Lost.11 More specifically, it considers how this treatise deepens our understanding of Fairfax; how it casts horse that thou so often hast bestrid', was ridden by the usurping Henry Bullingbrook during the lat ter's coronation, (v. 77-81, in William Shakespeare's Complete Works, ed. by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2007), p. 888). 7 An event commemorated by Fairfax in a poem entitled 'Upon the horse which his Majesty rode upon att his coronation 1660' (Bodleian Library, MS Fairfax 40, fol. 612). 8 Index of Early English Literary Manuscripts, ed. by Peter Beal, 2 vols (London and New York: Mansell, 1987), 1, 71. 9 The bulk of Fairfax's literary output can be found in Bodleian Library, MS Fairfax 40, which contains devotional and secular pieces, respectively entitled 'The Imployement of my Solitude' and 'The Recreation of my Solitude'. Edward Bliss Reed published a comparatively small selection of these a century ago, while Fairfax's four biographers provide essentially tokenistic examples of his verse.

I place the treatise within the context of the role and status of the horse in early modern England and in the Renaissance more generally, a topic which has yielded an increasing measure of scholarship in recent years, but which, given the huge influence of the horse in this period, none the less remains understudied,12 almost as though the very pervasiveness of the horse in English Renaissance culture has rendered it curiously undetectable. This ubiquity has recently been delineated by Karen Raber and Treva J. Tucker: Historians have long agreed that early modern life was saturated with horses and horse culture. [Horses] functioned both as a kind of technology in and of themselves, in such spheres as agriculture and the military, and as objects of some important technological developments, in areas extending from bits to breeding. Horses served man at all levels of society: they pulled both carts and carriages; they carried farmers to the market and noblemen into battle; they plodded across poor fields and pranced in equestrian ballets. Images and literary representations of horses and riders promoted and defined what it meant to be human, to be individual, to be of a certain class, to have a certain national identity, to hold to a certain set of values.13 Given the manifestly influential role of and concomitant demand for horses in England,14 in writing a treatise on horse-breeding Fairfax was engaging with an issue of wider national as well as local significance. National, in part be cause the original impulse behind horse-breeding in the early modern period had been the state's need for a ready supply of warhorses, a supply which Henry VIII's military adventures had exposed as worryingly elusive. Horse breeding conventions had been established by tried and tested techniques, but in print theorists rather than practised horse-breeders had flourished: works (October 2005), 121-31; ibid., 39.4 (December 2005), 183-292; ibid., 40.2 (May 2006), 99-187; ibid., 40.4 (December 2006), 263-91; ibid., 41.2 (May 2007), 79-147. 12 Modern monographs in English on the subject of horses in the early modern period remain com paratively few in number. They include, notably, Joan Thirsk, Horses in Early Modern England: For Service, for Pleasure, for Power (Reading: University of Reading Press, 1978); Anthony Dent, Horses in Shakespeare's England (London: Allen, 1987); Peter Edwards, The Horse Trade of Tudor and Stu art England (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988); Kevin de Ornellas, 'Troping the Horse in Early Modern English Literature and Culture' (unpublished doctoral thesis, Queen's University Belfast, 2003); The Culture of the Horse: Status, Discipline and Identity in the Early Modern World, ed. by Karen Raber and Treva J. Tucker (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2005); and Peter Edwards, Horse and Man in Early Modern England (London: Continuum, 2007). 13 'Introduction', in The Culture of the Horse, pp. 1-44 (pp. 1-2). 14 A demand which between 1500 and 1700 increased fourfold.</page><page sequence="4">PHILIP MAJOR 23 such as Nicholas Morgan's Perfection of Horsemanship (1609) and The Horse mans Honour; or, The Beautie of Horsemanshippe (1620), Michael Barrat's The Vineyard of Horsemanship (1619), and translations from Italian, such as Thomas Blunderville's Four Chiefest Offices Belonging to Horsemanship (1566), were reprinted numerous times. This body of literature, it should be noted, nourished some dubious ideas conspicuously absent in Fairfax's treatise, such as the belief in sex determination, whereby if a mare were to conceive under a female sign of the zodiac she would, it was averred, produce mare colts.15 Fairfax, by contrast, reflects and contributes to a more refined, proto-empiricist approach towards horse-breeding. Across the country this development was informed and char acterized by a growing awareness of horse commodification and the wider range of horses in the market-place. It was also aided by the liberalization of export rules and other interventionist government policies adopted by the Protectorate regime of 1657 under Cromwell, himself a keen horse-breeder. In many ways this trend parallels the greater awareness of functional differ ences between the various breeds as the [early modern] period progressed[, which is] reflected in the growing sophistication of the market and wide range of animals on offer there.'16 Though relatively concise, Fairfax's treatise is comprehensive, specific, and practical, subdivided as it is into the following chapters: Of Horses and Mares for breed in general From whence we shall have the Kinds of our Horses and which the best Whether a Horse or Mare of Perfection be more necessary in Breeding What Grounds be most fit to breed in and how ordered When and at What Times the Stallions are to be put to the Mares Why April is the fittest Time to begin to put your Horse to your Mares How to put your Horses and Mares together and how to diet them What to do when your Mares be near their foaling and how to be certain of the Time How long Colts should suck of their Dams How to know which Foal is worthy the reserving of his Dam to feed him all the Year At what Time to take your Colt into the House [barn] Of pertinence here is the impressive depth of scrutiny the author brings to bear, evidenced in the plethora of questions he poses: whence, whether, what, when, why, how. As a further illustration of Fairfax's attention to detail, we may adduce the cumulative specificity of the following section of narrative under 'How to put your horses and mares together and how to diet them', a 15 See Dent, Horses in Shakespeare's England, p. 20. 16 Edwards, The Horse Trade in Tudor and Stuart England, p. 15.</page><page sequence="5">24 Lord Fairfax's A treatise touching the breeding of horses' meticulousness which gestures towards the alchemical interests he enthusias tically pursued:17 You must be regardful that the Horse be in great Lust, yet if he be not too fat it is the better; he should be fed in that Time of covering with good coarse Bread, or with store of Beans amongst his Oats; we do use to have him at Soil and give him Grass with a little Provender [animal fodder]; but I do wish him to be above all Times to be well provendred, because your Grass gives a waterish Nature and maketh the Seed thin and cold and unapt for generation, for it is most fitt when it is thick and hot, and for this Cause also I would give little Water at once but often; if he was fed with Hay it were better; And when he is put to a Mare be careful that they both be empty and these Times should be early or late, and not in the Heat of the Day, and twice in the Morning and as often in the Evening shall suffice for that Time. (p. 4)18 There remains room for lighter moments, however; even for untypical flashes of humour, exemplified in a passage on which breeds mix best: The natural fault of the Courser [race horse] is long legs, which the Dutch will help; the natural fault of the Jennet &amp; Barbary is slenderness and a loose Trot which the Dutch will help. The natural fault of the Dutch is heaviness, which all these three will help. (p. 2). Nor, it should be said, does Fairfax's proto-empiricism preclude more subjec tive and speculative observations: for example, a horse's 'Spirit', the reader is assured, 'may be conjectured in the greatness of the Fire of his Eye' (p. 7). The tone of Fairfax's treatise is less didactic and prescriptive than homely and avuncular. This is significant, since it betrays one of the author's signal purposes. For while on one level this is simply an eminently modest, unas suming work on horse-breeding, on another it is undeniably a display of effortless aristocratic privilege. Fairfax does not need to persuade or convince his readers of the efficacy of his breeding methods; his experience, his privi leged status as a wealthy landowner and as a peer of the realm speak for him. He can afford to insert studiedly modest, polite qualifying clauses, such as 'if you take my opinion' (p. 5); relatedly we note from its affectedly self-effacing title that the treatise is merely 'touching' the breeding of horse. Here, form complements register; in remaining an unpublished autograph manuscript, the treatise, like all of Fairfax's writings, pointedly avoids the 'stigma of print'. Fairfax's confidence in and assertion of his elite social status operate on a number of layers. In excavating them, our starting-point needs to be a clear comprehension that to keep horses in this period was in and of itself a mark of social distinction. Possessing horses, never mind breeding them, 17 Philip Major, 'Exile in the English Revolution and its Aftermath, 1640-1680' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of London, Birkbeck College, 2007), pp. 224-26. 18 For the benefits rendered by its more modern spelling, all quotations from Fairfax's treatise are from the transcript of the original autograph manuscript copied in the eighteenth century by John Hardy and also held at York Minster Library.</page><page sequence="6">PHILIP MAJOR 25 earned respect and conferred power; it was a sine qua non for economic independence. The subtext, or one of them, to a treatise on horse-breeding is that the author enjoys the leisure time to indulge in and write about his chosen topic, demonstrating that ownership of horses at the very highest end of the spectrum [. . .] required not only a substantial amount of surplus wealth but also, in many cases, a substantial amount of surplus time'.19 Fair fax advertises the associated wealth he enjoys that enables him to afford the land, the estate, the buildings, and the staff referred to in the text: peppered throughout the treatise are strategically casual references to the important role played by your Freeman or Groom' in the horse-breeding process. Un questionably Fairfax is writing for a privileged, landed audience; indeed, he pervasively addresses his readers as gentlemen'. The assertion of noble birth, the intertwining of horses with the culture of the nobility, cuts across the main political divide of the mid-century. Elite one-time parliamentarians, even those, like Fairfax, who otherwise adopt an image of self-effacement, reveal themselves, not least through their equine interests, to be just as self consciously haut monde as royalists. The horse, that is, remains a prime vehicle for any wealthy family's political ambitions and dynastic obligations. And the notion of good breeding' which hovers over the treatise, signifying the im portance of descent in the animal but also human world, dovetails neatly with the concept of the honnete homme. Correspondingly, the horse in this period is a key leitmotif in the culture and narrative of rule, strongly symbolic of political power and command, of the naturalized synthesis of reining and reigning. It has been accurately observed that elite-specific mounted activi ties [...] could foster a sense of group superiority to and differentiation from those of less exalted status, who did not participate in or even have access to such activities'.20 Horse-breeding was not the least significant of these activities. None the less, the relationship between control, discipline, and horseman ship underwent a palpable change in the seventeenth century. A new dynamic of sympathetic co-operation between horse and trainer or breeder, the notion of a more benign human agency, gradually replaced the traditional emphasis on control and forceful domination, though whether this plausibly mirrors contemporary political changes is a moot point.21 Fairfax accommodates this shift: in places his treatise is noticeably caring, even loving, in its attitude towards horses. Nowhere is this evidenced more clearly than in the following passage, where the author advises any reader whose cmares be likely to [foal] early' to 19 Raber and Tucker, 'Introduction', p. 7. 20 Ibid., p. 2. 21 See ibid., p. 19.</page><page sequence="7">26 Lord Fairfax's 'A treatise touching the breeding of horses' take them into your House and lay them in some great Barn spaciously from one another, &amp; litter them plentifully. Then let your Freeman or Groom lay in the same Room and when he shall hear them begin to labour of foaling let him quickly attend them; and if there be danger he may help them by holding the Nostrils of the Mare which will give her a more easy Delivery, or easy drawing her foal from her; but this must be tenderly &amp; discreetly done. (p. 5). There is a local dimension to such paternalism, to Fairfax's profession of power and prestige. Fairfax was, inter alia, a proud Yorkshireman; his power base was in Yorkshire, a county traditionally regarded, along with Durham, as the home of the best horses and horse-breeders in England.22 Having ex ited the national stage in 1650, when he stunningly resigned his position as Commander-in-Chief rather than lead Parliament's pre-emptive invasion of Scotland, Fairfax retired to his Nun Appleton estate in the vale of York. The literature he produced in retirement, including this treatise, can be seen as a means of reintegrating and reasserting himself within elite Yorkshire society, and thereby as a compensation for his (albeit voluntary) forfeiture of enor mous national power. It demonstrates that he is still an important player on the local stage, and hence represents in one respect a pre-emptive rebuttal of any insinuated declasse status. If read at all?and regrettably we have no firm knowledge of its circulation?the treatise on horse-breeding would have been read by landowners he knew in the Yorkshire area, whose admiration and respect, even fear, he could still count on. At this local level the esteem in which a prominent family was held by its peers could be enhanced [. . .] if that family were known as a breeder of horses'.23 In this regard, it was felici tously enabling of Fairfax's literary strategy that in the early modern period, notwithstanding the nascent empiricism he himself espoused, it remained the case that the practice of horse-breeding [...] was governed by traditional lore and the accumulated experience of past generations'.24 Another significant national dimension, though, is also discernible?and more problematic. It is important to remember that the gentry had tradition ally played a key role in promoting good horse-breeding, in raising standards across the country. They had been encouraged to do so partly by legislation and partly by persuasion. Horsemanship and its corollary, horse-breeding, helped to create a sense of group identity and superiority, so that treatises such as Fairfax's reinforced expressions of burgeoning national identity in the seventeenth century, and provided a means of affirming cultural differentia tion among states. 22 Pre-eminent Yorkshire breeders of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries included Ninian Stavely, Henry Broughton, Sir George Reresby, and Sir Richard Cholmondeley. See Edwards, The Horse Trade in Tudor and Stuart England, p. 73. 23 Raber and Tucker, 'Introduction', p. 12. 24 Dent, Horses in Shakespeare's England, p. 18.</page><page sequence="8">PHILIP MAJOR 27 This national and patriotic component of the treatise can be detected in certain phrases Fairfax deploys, such as amongst the best breed of our nation' (p. 2), burs be more phlegmatic' (p. 2), bur horses in England' (p. 2), ?by the help of our Houses we may breed as well as any Nation in Christendom' (p. 7). Here we witness the construction of an oppositional identity for the English Protestant horse-breeder and equestrian. Yet there is a significant measure of ambivalence too, since this treatise is by no means a myopic account and promulgation of the virtues of English horses and methods. On the contrary, Fairfax is eager, like the majority of his contemporaries,25 to emphasize his high regard for foreign, exotic breeds; and, paradoxically, much of the patriotic element in the treatise derives from English familiarity with those very breeds. In both regards Fairfax mirrors contemporaries such as William Cavendish, the royalist commander who wrote a book on horsemanship in exile on the Continent in the 1650s, La Methode et invention nouvelle de dresser les chevaux (Antwerp: Jaques van Meurs, 1658), and another in the 1660s, New Method and Extraordinary Invention of Dressing Horses (London: Thomas Milbourn, 1667). In the latter, English horses are compared unfavourably with those of other regions, especially Spain and North Africa, yet the national cause will, it is argued, be well served by the book, since 'England will thus have an origi nal, practical training manual, based on rational and empirical inquiry about techniques, breeds, and so on'.26 Furthermore, Cavendish's explicit locating of exotic breeds, most memorably by means of sumptuously produced, impres sionistic illustrations, within the milieu of the English aristocratic country estate is a device which speaks, like Fairfax's treatise, to an imperative of benign appropriation and taming of the alien other'. Hence, to the end of enhancing national self-identity, both works seek an efficacious extension of English elite knowledge by accommodating the finest breeds and methods that other nations have to offer. An additional common link between Fairfax and Cavendish which influ ences their respective compositions is exile, respectively internal and external. It may at first seem a redundant exercise to find meaningful comparisons between the two men's experiences of retreat, not least since Fairfax played a major role in the decimation of Newcastle's northern forces, culminating in their defeat at Marston Moor in 1644, as a direct result of which Cavendish took flight for the Continent from Scarborough. Yet for both ex-commanders the recreational consolation of horses is tangible. Fairfax was always a keen horseman, his father, as mentioned above, had bred horses, and early into his 25 Morgan's Perfection of Horsemanship provides a table of the most popular breeds in England. Significantly, no English breed is found in the top thirteen entries. See Dent, Horses in Shakespeare's England, p. 78. 26 Karen Raber, 'A Horse of a Different Color: Nation and Race in Early Modern Horsemanship Treatises', in Raber and Tucker, pp. 225-43 (p- 233).</page><page sequence="9">28 Lord Fairfax's A treatise touching the breeding of horses' retirement, in 1651, his horse-breeding capacity was further improved when he was presented with the stud at Helmsley by the Commonwealth, as a salve for a bad wound received at the siege of the castle there in 1644, when it fell into his hands'.27 Cavendish, meanwhile, had in his own words resolved 'for his own recreation and divertissement in his banished condition, to exercise the art of manage'.28 In both cases, what is evident in their writing, over and above the mani festation of a genuine passion for horses, is an assertion of control over the animal kingdom which had been lost in the military and political arena, a symbolic reaffirmation of the lasting authority of the 'natural aristocrat' who has withdrawn from public life. Though relatively short, Fairfax's work is, as we have witnessed, divertingly detailed. An unspoken intention and effect of this is the provision of a guide for every aspect of benevolent human involvement in the custodianship of horses in general and the practice of horse-breeding in particular. As with Cavendish, though his direct influence in national affairs has suddenly and dramatically terminated, the reader is to infer that Fairfax's knowledge of and command over horses remains emi nently unimpaired. Cavendish's New Method is, in its own field, even more comprehensive, but perhaps most arrestingly its magnificent, numerous illus trations portray the author as not only implementing the training techniques of his book?significantly in the grounds of his various stately homes, no tably Welbeck?but also surrounded by adoring horses in allegorical scenes, showing his complete and effortless mastery over them. It is an expression of supremacy and domination which stands athwart, and hence brings atone ment for, his ignominious flight, particularly as Clarendon saw it,29 from England, and his own subsequent loss of military and political status. Like his opposite number Prince Rupert, Fairfax rode a Barbary in the Civil Wars, a horse from North Africa. If these are bred with English horses, he argues in his treatise, this will produce 'the most useful Horses in the world, for then will Spirit, Beauty and Strength be met' (p. 2). Fairfax is not afraid to concede that 'we have scarce a Horse that we may properly say is wholly descended from the English, but hath had some mixture with the Strangers' (p. 2). Such intermixing, he continues, 'we have reason to do to reduce [Eng lish horses] to more Spirit and Beauty' (p. 2). Regarding horses from hotter 27 C. M.

Lee, 21 vols (London: Smith, 1885-1900; repr. 1908). 29 According to an astringent Clarendon, Cavendish 'hoped his past meritorious actions might outweigh his present abandoning the thought of future action; and so without further consideration as hath been said, he transported himself out of the kingdom' (Clarendon: Selections from 'The History of the Rebellion'; and, the 'Life' by Himself, ed. by G. Huehns with a new introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978), p. 259).</page><page sequence="10">PHILIP MAJOR 29 climates, he writes, 'there be not any that may justly be compared with the horses of Naples for Beauty, Puissance and Obedience' (p. 2). Ubiquitously he recommends that English breeds be mixed with the Turk, with the Nillane and Jennet of Spain, and with breeds from Friesland and, as we have seen, Hol land. Present-day familiarity with such breeds as the Barbary and the Turk has desensitized us to their exoticism,30 yet at the time they were highly prized, difficult to acquire, and for all but the wealthy prohibitively expensive.31 In Fairfax's evident awareness and appreciation of rare breeds of horses can be identified an interesting parallel with his predilection for literature of an exotic flavour, exemplified in his translation of the Christianized Indian romance Barlaam and Josephat32 As with Barlaam, the exotic subject-matter in Fairfax's treatise is to some extent in tension with the sedulously cultivated, self-fashioning emphasis on humility and integrity characteristic of Fairfax's writings. The same can be said for qualities such as 'beauty' invoked in the treatise, which by contrast in his poetry, and in particular his devotional treatise 'The Thoughts of Eternity',33 Fairfax is quick to dismiss in humans as a short-lived, temporal distraction from pious thoughts of the afterlife: sic transit gloria mundi. By no means, however, is a religious impulse, and the textual authority it affords, absent from his treatise; witness these opening, clearly biblically inspired lines from the first chapter, 'Of Horses and Mares for breed in general': He that would build well must lay a good foundation. He that would reap good Fruits must plant good Trees; for no man can gather Grapes from Thorns, or Figs from Thistles. So he that would breed good Horses must look that his Stallion and Mares of which he doth breed be perfect; otherwise his Colts will be imperfect, like those from which they do come. (p. 1) These are sentiments closely allied to the New Testament warning on reaping and sowing, and as such are applicable to but also indubitably reach beyond the ambit of horse-breeding. Again we see evidence in examples such as this of the rightful assertion of aristocratic privilege and paternalism suffusing a work apparently confined to one specific, elitist activity. Metaphorical significance can be inferred from the next section also, in which we learn from the author that In his [the horse-breeder's] Store six things are requisite: Youth, Strength, Courage, Temper, Shape and Colour. Youth for their aptness to engender and conceive, because 30 Raber and Tucker, 'Introduction', p. 11. 31 It is noteworthy that as Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell is known to have been keen to import Arabian horses.

Strength to perform much Labour. Courage to bear themselves gracefully and not to faint upon light causes. Shape and Colour to grace their outward parts: For observe that without the Proportion be good, the house cannot be good. (p. 1) Some of the anthropomorphic words and phrases Fairfax uses here could almost have sprung from an old advertising campaign for godly New Model Army recruits: youth', strength', courage', 'temper', and 'shape'; the con tention, articulated further on, that a horse will be 'slothful if he do not labour for his bellyful'. More subtly, and significantly, there is stress placed on the idea of proportionality which chimes in harmony with a perennial preoccu pation of Fairfax's writing: modesty. In particular, this section resonates with the 'short but admirable lines' which oppose the 'unproportioned dwellings', as depicted by Marvell in his poem on Fairfax and his Nun Appleton estate, a powerfully suggestive trope reinforced by the piquant brevity of Fairfax's own poem on Nun Appleton: Think not, o Man that dwells herein, This House's a Stay, but as an Inne Which for convenience fitly stands In way to one nott made with hands. But if a time here thou take Rest, Yett think Eternity's the Best.34 In conclusion, Thomas Fairfax's ostensibly innocuous treatise on horse breeding proves on closer inspection to be a revealing confluence of com plementary and competing concerns: familial tradition and aptitude in both horse-breeding and writing; the endorsement of more empirical, though still less than fully scientific, horse-breeding methods; the assertion of landed wealth and residual local power and status still enjoyed by a once national but now retired figure; the symbolism of naturalized rule and command; patriotism and yet a strong affinity with foreign horses; and a curious confi guration of exoticism, proportionality, and humility. More widely, it provokes further consideration of the horse's considerable value in early modern life and elite culture, and the ways in which the genuinely pragmatic purposes of horse-writing could profitably be harnessed to the personal and emblematic.
