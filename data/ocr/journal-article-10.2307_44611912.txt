ABSTRACT In 1988, United States and European airworthiness authorities adopted amendments to regulations for improved occupant protection, included in the amendments are requirements for improved head strike protection for passengers seated behind interior structures. The Bulkhead Air Bag System has been developed to provide head strike protection in accordance with these requirements and to meet the airworthiness and installation requirements for transport- category aircraft. A fully functional developmental system has been demonstrated by means of dynamic impact tests using drop tower and deceleration sled dynamic impact test facilities. The system was also demonstrated on a full-scale eight-passenger aircraft crash test. In each test, the Bulkhead Air Bag System successfully demonstrated Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)-compliant head strike protection, and is now in development for specific aircraft applications. INTRODUCTION United States and European airworthiness regulations were revised in 1988 to improve occupant safety during a survivable crash. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 25 (Reference 1) and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) 25 (Reference 2) were amended to adopt dynamic performance standards for defined emergency landing conditions. These regulations include a requirement for protecting the occupant from serious head strike injury due to contact with interior structures during a crash. The head strike protection requirement has been particularly difficult to meet for the front-row seat positions located behind interior cabin structures such as bulkheads, class partitions, galleys, and wardrobes. Various methods of compliance have been investigated without much success. The certification authorities continue to grant temporary regulatory exemptions from the head strike requirement. The Bulkhead Air Bag System is designed to provide a means of passive supplemental restraint for front-row seated passengers on transport-category aircraft. Additionally, the system has been developed to meet the unique requirements for use in aircraft. Design features and the system's configuration have been driven by FAR/ JAR-specified crash conditions, injury mechanisms, and airworthiness certification requirements of transport- category aircraft. During the crash event, sensors within the Bulkhead Air Bag System detect the crash pulse and initiate system deployment. Occupant head strike protection is provided by a rapidly inflating air bag that deploys from a module mounted on the structure in front of the occupant. The air bag acts as a cushion between the occupant and the strike hazard. Occupant interaction with the bag attenuates the occupant's energy and provides head injury protection. The bag is also designed to allow rapid passenger egress from the aircraft. BACKGROUND Transport-category aircraft airworthiness regulations first introduced requirements that included assessment of the potential for human impact injury in 1988. Amendment 25-64 to FAR 25, and Change 13 to JAR 25, included requirements for improved occupant protection for the defined emergency landing conditions. The requirement to prevent serious head strike injury is contained in paragraph 25.562 of the regulations. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 25.562-1 (Reference 3) provides suggested compliance methodology for this requirement. Introduction of requirements governing the potential for human impact injury were made possible from the development of dynamic performance standards. Dynamic standards, as opposed to existing static standards, created a means to quantitatively measure the potential for human impact injury through the use of an instrumented Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD). Dynamic performance requirements for civil aircraft were developed from programs that began in the 1970's to improve the crashworthiness of aircraft. Cooperative efforts by the FAA, NASA, major aircraft manufacturers, 157</page><page sequence="2">and others in the aviation industry were the key to obtaining and integrating the needed information (Reference 4). Accident data analysis, analysis of crash dynamics, full-scale impact testing, and aircraft seat tests were used to develop the standards. The dynamic performance standards established the dynamic crash pulse and the human impact requirements adopted into the regulations. The crash pulse (shown in Figure 1) is intended to represent the limit of human crash survivability based on the structurai limits of the aircraft floor.

An ATD instrumented for head acceleration is used for test cases that involve aircraft structure within the head strike envelope. The HIC value is calculated from the resultant head acceleration of the ATD and is defined by the equation shown in Figure 2. The maximum HIC value is limited to 1,000, which has been established as the threshold of serious head impact injury (Reference 5). For repeatability and standardization of the test results, the regulations require the use of an occupant simulated by a 170-lb ATD, as defined by Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Subpart B. This occupant is represented by Hybrid II, 50th-percentile male ATD (Reference 6).

Figure 2: HIC Definition HIC values below 1,000 have been particularly difficult to achieve for the front-row seat positions located behind cabin structures such as bulkheads, class partitions, galleys, and wardrobes. To date, there have been no protection systems fully certificated that meet the front- row HIC requirement. As a result, United States and European airworthiness certification authorities have granted temporary exemptions to the head strike protection requirement while industry continues to investigate potential solutions. HEAD INJURY PROTECTIVE METHODS FOR FRONT- ROW PASSENGERS Various means of providing head strike protection for the front-row occupants have been researched and tested by industry. Potentially simple solutions to meet the HIC compliance requirement have not materialized. The addition of shoulder harnesses has been considered, but this creates extensive design issues for the seats, floor, and aircraft structure. Shoulder harnesses alter the transmission of occupant loads to the seat during a crash. Seatback pivoting must be essentially eliminated to limit the forward motion of the occupant. Design changes would then be required to increase seat stiffness and strength. This, in turn, results in changes to the loading of the aircraft floor structure by the seats. The shoulder harness approach also suffers from low customer acceptance. Padding and energy-absoibing materials or energy- absorbing structure have also been investigated as a means to meet the HIC compliance requirement. Efforts to certify aircraft using this technology have failed due, in part, to unrepeatable test results. The large distance between the occupant and the cabin structure allows high impact velocities to develop compared to the seat positions located behind the front-row seats. Achieving a design that has acceptable pad thickness while maintaining the properties necessary to effectively absorb the occupant's crash energy is difficult. Aft-facing seats are an alternative that eliminates the problem for one row of passengers, but creates problems for the next row. Passengers seated facing the aft-facing row risk striking the knees or the seat structure of the occupants or seats in the aft-facing row. Alternatively, all of the seat rows could be aft-facing; however, this causes extensive design issues. Each seat backrest must be redesigned to carry the load of the occupant's weight during the crash. This causes load transmission issues for the seat and aircraft floor structure that are similar to those that exist for shoulder harnesses. Various types of inflatable restraint systems have been investigated for use in aircraft, (References 7 and 8). Experiments have been conducted at the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI). Very large bags (as compared to those used in the Bulkhead Air Bag System) as well as automotive air bag systems were used. These research programs showed promise for the use of air bag systems to enhance passenger protection in aircraft, but raised concerns regarding issues such as injury due to air bag deployment, occupant egress, system noise, weight, and size. These concerns were studied and addressed in the development of the Bulkhead Air Bag System. Simula's efforts included parametric studies, analytical models, and full-scale impact tests to establish functional and physical features of the system to mitigate these concerns. 158</page><page sequence="3">SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The three primary components of the Bulkhead Air Bag System, as shown in Figure 3, are the air bag module, the gas generator, and the crash sensor/ diagnostics module. The air bag module consists of: 1 ) a cover, which seals and protects the internal components, 2) a housing, which serves as the interface attachment for both the gas generator and the aircraft; and 3) an air bag, which is inflated to protect the occupant. The gas generator, as depicted in Figure 4, is comprised of a housing for the pyrotechnic igniter with an initiator, a gas-producing propellant, filtering screens, and a case which contains the combustion and filter chambers. The gas generator produces gas after receiving an electric signal from the crash sensor/ diagnostics module. A pyrotechnic initiator within the gas generator converts an electric signal to heat, which causes a primer charge to bum, which, in turn, ignites the igniter charge and the propellant. High-temperature gas is produced which is filtered, cooled, and directed into the air bag for inflation. The crash sensor/diagnostics module, as shown in Figure 5, consists of crash-sensing elements, diagnostics electronics, a firing circuit, and a systems-readiness test switch and indicator. The diagnostic electronics monitor system health, and detect and report system failures. The firing circuit is actuated by the sensors and provides the electrical signal to initiate air bag deployment. Power can be supplied by the aircraft's electrical system or by internal batteries. The crash-sensing elements respond to aircraft accelerations and velocity changes. Determination of a crash event occurs when the velocity change and peak acceleration exceed preset thresholds. Thresholds are established that prevent inadvertent deployment during normal flight conditions, but still deploy the system in crash conditions that would cause serious injury. When the aircraft experiences a longitudinal velocity change and acceleration of sufficient magnitude to indicate a crash impact, the crash sensor/diagnostics module senses the crash and delivers an electrical pulse to the gas generator initiator. The gas generator then inflates the bag which is stored in the module mounted on the cabin structure in front of the occupant. Once inflated, the air bag acts as a cushion to decelerate the occupant's head and upper torso and reduce the relative Figure 3: Bulkhead Air Bag Module 159</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4: Gas Generator Figure 5: Crash Sensor/Diagnostics Module velocity between the aircraft structure and the occupant. The impact energy is attenuated by the deformation and venting (through a controlled orifice) of the bag during occupant loading. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT The Bulkhead Air Bag System was developed specifically for front-row head injury protection. Analytical models were used to evaluate the occupant motion and system timing constraints for proper system operation. Engineering parametric studies were conducted to determine the effects of various bag shapes, sizes, and deployment characteristics on occupant protection using typical transport-category aircraft interior configurations. Seat setback distances ranging from the shortest to the longest commonly used in the industry were tested. Various adult occupant sizes were evaluated, including a simulated 5th-percentile male, a 50th-percentile male, and a 95th-percentile male. This evaluation was accomplished through over 60 dynamic crash tests using the Simula drop tower, as shown in Figure 6. The system's configuration has evolved into a design that allows controlled movement of the occupant and interacts with the occupant's upper torso and head. The approach of allowing controlled movement, rather than trying to severely limit the occupant's movement, enabled the use of a much smaller bag. The smaller air bag greatly reduces the risk of injury due to the deploying bag, allows rapid egress from the aircraft, and reduces the noise and weight of the system. Designing the system to decelerate both the upper torso and head limits the relative motion between the two, thereby reducing the risk of neck injury. Ensuring that the system was designed without transferring the injury mechanism from head impact to neck extension or flexion was emphasized during the development effort. Neck loads were evaluated during many of the development tests. Although the airworthiness regulations do not address injury protection for the neck, the potential for this type of the injury has been raised during evaluation of front-row occupant motion (References 9 and 10). Figure 6: Simula Drop Tower 160</page><page sequence="5">DEMONSTRATION TESTING AT CAMI In December of 1993, Simula successfully completed concept demonstration testing at the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The photographs shown in Figure 7 were taken during dynamic sled tests performed during Bulkhead Air Bag System demonstration testing. The first photo shows the sled just prior to air bag deployment. In the second photo, the occupant is shown loading into the deployed air bag as the sled decelerates. Figure 7: Deployment Sequence These tests were performed using a typical transport- category aircraft interior configuration and the forward impact conditions defined in the FAA AC 25.562-1 . Both 0-degree and 10-degree yaw orientations were included in the testing. These tests showed that the Bulkhead Air Bag System performed properly for the impact conditions which are considered to be at the limit of survivability. Tests were also performed using the lower impact conditions shown in Figure 8. Lower impact condition tests were conducted to evaluate crash sensor timing and the ability of the system to provide adequate protection at off-requirement impact conditions. These crash conditions, with lower peak accelerations and longer onset rates, indicated that the system deploys the air bag at the proper time and for crash conditions well below the requirement. In each test, the system successfully demonstrated FAR-compliant head strike protection. The test results are summarized in Table 1 .

The test's primary objective 161</page><page sequence="6">was to evaluate the floor structure of the composite aircraft. A secondary objective was to evaluate crashworthy technology. Various experiments, including the Bulkhead Air Bag System, were installed on the aircraft. The test was conducted on September 9, 1995, at the NASA Langley Impact Dynamics Test Facility in Hampton, Virginia (Reference 11). Two-side-by-side seat positions in the rear of the aircraft were made available to Simula for the Bulkhead Air Bag System demonstration. The demonstration used two 50th-percentile male Hybrid II ATD's seated next to each other in front of an interior bulkhead (non- structural). The interior was configured to represent a common transport-category aircraft. Both ATD's were fitted with lap belts that were attached to typical 9-G aircraft seats. To assess the effectiveness of the air bag, the port bulkhead was not equipped with an air bag in order to serve as a baseline. The starboard bulkhead was fitted with the Bulkhead Air Bag System. Seat tracks were fabricated and firmly attached to the primary aircraft structure. These tracks served as the mounting surface for the crash sensor/diagnostics module to ensure proper transmission of the airframe's accelerations near the occupants. Batteries mounted within the crash sensor and diagnostics module provided system power. The objective of the experiment was to gain general knowledge of the Bulkhead Air Bag System's functional characteristics in a full-scale crash. The chosen impact conditions (Table 2) were established by NASA for floor structure evaluation and resulted in much higher vertical acceleration compared to the longitudinal accelerations. The resulting longitudinal accelerations were severe enough to trigger the air bag system, but not severe enough to cause serious head injury for either the air- bag-protected or the non-air-bag-protected occupant. The resulting vertical accelerations, however, caused occupant lumbar loading (for which the air bag system is not designed to protect), above the injury thresholds. Table 2. Crash Test Impact Conditions. Resultant velocity: 88 ft/sec Vertical component: 30 ft/sec Horizontal component: 80 ft/sec Flight path: -20.6 deg Pitch: +20.6 deg (flat impact) Roll: 0 deg Yaw: 0 deg The Bulkhead Air Bag System deployed properly during the crash. The head accelerations and HIC values were of similar magnitude for each of the ATD's. The results for both seat positions were well within the head injury requirements of the regulations. CURRENT STATUS OF THE BULKHEAD AIR BAG SYSTEM After completing the development and demonstration of the Bulkhead Air Bag System in conceptual form, testing continued using specific aircraft interior configurations. Certification requirements for the application of an air bag system into transport-category aircraft have also been defined. Recently, Simula entered into an agreement with Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. to develop the Bulkhead Air Bag System for use on the Jetstream 41 model aircraft. Work on the system's design and certification for that aircraft is currently in progress. SUMMARY The Bulkhead Air Bag System has successfully demonstrated that the FAR 25.562 head strike protection requirements can be met with inflatable restraint technology. The Bulkhead Air Bag System has shown that the technology can provide protection over a wide range of crash conditions, and for a wide range of adult occupant sizes. Inflatable restraint systems can be designed for application into transport-category aircraft and can perform properly with regard to issues such as egress and noise. Based on this, the application of inflatable restraint technology can enhance transport aircraft passenger safety. REFERENCES 1 .
