If your work is accepted, please keep the manag ing editor (mmalgrande@pace.edu) and the copy editor (pdoliner@twcny.rr.com) informed of changes of address and long absences. Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@univ.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of your title page. Abstract. An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes placed on their respective pages. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Phrase it in the present tense. Give it a distinct number (Hypothesis 1) or number letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMffs wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 823 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-kM\(Xtri ?i(Yt = ytxt) =-y?T~' (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AM/to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables. Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than . . . are significant at. . . . Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: +p &lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables.</page><page sequence="3">2008 Style Guide for Authors 825 Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation? (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs {Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Tifie (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.) Examples: Granovetter, M. S. 1965. Getting a job: A study of contracts and careers. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Kahn, R. L., &amp; Boulding, E. (Eds.). 1964.

National Center for Education Statistics. 1992. Digest of ed ucation statistics. Washington DC: National Center for Education Statistics. Periodicals. Follow this form: Authors' last names, initials. Year. Title (regular type; same sin gle-capital rule as for books). Name of Periodical (boldface italic, title-style capitalization), volume number (issue number, if needed?see below): page numbers. Examples: Shrivastava, P. 1995. The role of corporations in achieving ecological sustainability. Academy of Management Re view, 20: 936-960. Nonaka, I. 1991. The knowledge-creating company. Harvard Business Review, 69(6): 96-104. Include an issue number only if every issue of the referenced periodical begins with a page numbered 1. (Look at more than one issue to check.) If an article has no author, the periodical is ref erenced. Examples: BusinessWeek. 1998. The best B-schools. October 19: 86-94. Harvard Business Review. 2003. How are we doing? 81(4): 3.
