La vel le General Motors Corporation Copyright Â© 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT This paper examines the effect that test barriers currently used for frontal and side impact tests have had on collision compatibility between different-sized vehicles. The peak force levels generated by the vehicles' front structures are one of the significant factors in determining vehicle compatibility. It is shown from principles of mechanics that the use of fixed barriers as a test device may lead to higher force levels for front ends of larger vehicles and thus increase the incompatibility between large and small vehicles. Review of data from various sources supports this conclusion that the peak force levels of vehicles' front ends have increased in proportion to their test mass. Available crash data is also examined for a relationship between NCAP ratings of vehicles and the likelihood of serious and fatal injuries to occupants of those vehicles. These data do not show any relationship between the frontal NCAP ratings of vehicles and their rate of serious or fatal injuries. The side impact (or LINCAP) rating, however, shows relationship of decreasing fatalities and serious injuries with higher test ratings. INTRODUCTION The increasing numbers of larger vehicles, specially light truck-based vehicles (LTVs) such as sports utilities and pick-up trucks being used as passenger vehicles, have led to concerns about the collision compatibility between different-sized vehicles on the roads today. Several studies have been published on different aspects of this issue. In a recent publication (1), Summers et al analyzed crash statistics from 1980 to 1999 and concluded that while the fatalities in collisions between passenger cars have declined, there has been an increase in fatalities in LTV-to-car collisions. Several other studies (2-5) have attempted to define the factors that influence the collision compatibility between vehicles of different sizes. These studies have generally used crash tests or computer simulation of crashes to evaluate the relative importance of factors such as height and mass differences, impact angles, impact locations and different front-end stiffness of vehicles on the likelihood of injuries to the occupants of the smaller vehicle. Other publications have been aimed at trying to define the test criteria for judging the compatibility between vehicles. Mizuno et al (6) discussed three different test barrier concepts - an offset deformable barrier test, an overload barrier test and a moving deformable barrier test - as possible means to judge the compatibility of passenger vehicles in frontal crashes. In another study, Delannoy and Diboine (7) suggested a progressively deformable barrier (PDB) as a possible evaluation method for collision compatibility between two cars in frontal crashes. In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been conducting research into developing a laboratory test procedure to evaluate compatibility with focus on collisions between LTVs and cars and has published (8) data on "average" measurements of several vehicle parameters such as vehicle weight, dimensions, force-deflection properties, average height of force etc. This research effort and the gathered data are intended to represent the US vehicle population and it is possible that all or some of these parameters may form the basis for a new test procedure for vehicle compatibility. It is interesting to note that in general, U.S. efforts in vehicle compatibility have been aimed at LTV-to-car compatibility whereas in other countries, the collisions between large cars and smaller cars seems to be the area of primary interest. While the above-mentioned and several other studies have tried to identify the vehicle parameters that may affect compatibility, not much attention has been paid to the existing vehicle safety requirements that directly or indirectly influence collision compatibility by influencing the same parameters that are important for vehicle compatibility. In one such study, Park et al (9) examined statistical data from 1983-1998 for LTVs. Their measure of the change in vehicles' structural properties was based on observation of test data from several NCAP tests. While the authors presented data to support their conclusion that 'the maximum dynamic crush... have increased over' the time period under study (1983- 920</page><page sequence="2">1998), the attribution of this effect to improving NCAP ratings is not clearly established by their work. It should be noted that several other factors were influencing LTV designs during the period under study and these are not identified or investigated in the paper. For example, the application of regulatory requirements for frontal crash protection (FMVSS 208) was implemented for LTVs (GVWR &lt;8500 lbs, unloaded vehicle mass &lt;5500 lbs) in stages from September 1991 through September 1994. This passive protection requirement governs the front- end structural design and requires provisions of adequate space for crush and of more efficient (energy absorbing) structural designs in order to meet the regulatory requirements. The implementation of this requirement and the associated introduction of airbags in LTVs were the dominant factors in determining the front-end force levels for LTVs and this is not accounted for by the authors (9). To separate the effects of this from NCAP-driven changes, it is necessary to further refine the data and to compare the vehicle design changes that are solely or predominantly attributable to the improvement in NCAP performance. The study presented in this paper shows that crash test requirements which use fixed barriers as a test device have caused heavier vehicles to have stronger front ends than the lighter vehicles. Thus, the front-end strengths of different sized vehicles have become more incompatible due to the use of fixed barriers as test devices. Since this is a consequence of the mechanics of the event and of the test device, it will be necessary to change the test device in order to change this effect. TEST BARRIER INFLUENCE ON FRONT STIFFNESS The term 'stiffness' is used here to indicate the peak forces that are generated and it is therefore different from the definition of linear definition of stiffness (force per unit deflection). There are several regulations and consumer metrics that govern the design of automobiles used as passenger vehicles. For protection in frontal crashes, FMVSS 208 is the primary regulation governing the design and requires that a set of criteria be met by the vehicle and by anthropomorphic test devices in the vehicles when the vehicle is crashed into a fixed rigid barrier. These criteria determine the design of the vehicle structure as well as of the interior and the restraint systems. The consumer metrics currently in use in the U.S. are primarily the NCAP tests conducted by the NHTSA and the offset deformable barrier (ODB) tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The NCAP testing is divided between the frontal and the lateral (LINCAP) testing. In the frontal NCAP test, the vehicle is crashed into a fixed rigid barrier at 35 mph and the performance of the vehicle is rated by number of 'stars' on a scale of one to five stars. In the ODB testing, as conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the vehicle is offset by forty percent and crashed at 40 mph into a fixed barrier with a deformable face. The performance of the vehicle and the structure is rated on a scale 'poor' - 'marginal' - 'acceptable' -'good'. While the consumer metrics results are not legally mandated, they have wide publication and visibility, leading to significant efforts by all the major automobile manufacturers to improve the performance of their vehicles in these tests. When a vehicle is crashed into a fixed barrier, Fig. 1 shows the general dynamic equations governing this. The kinetic energy prior to the impact equals 1/2 mass of the vehicle multiplied by the square of its impact velocity. During the impact, this energy is translated into crush of vehicle and the displacements of the vehicle and its occupants (ignoring the small amounts of energy that may be converted into heat and sound). If the force exerted by the vehicle on the barrier were plotted as a function of the displacement of the vehicle's center of gravity, the area under this curve must equal the kinetic energy prior to impact. Thus, the area under this force- displacement curve will be larger for a heavier vehicle than for a lighter one due to its higher initial energy. Figure 1 : Vehicle crash into fixed barrier It is important to note here that the available crush distance tends to be similar for most vehicles regardless of their size. This available crush distance is dependent on several factors that determine length of the vehicle's front end as well as on the front-end packaging and is generally independent of the vehicle mass. It then follows that the larger area under the force-displacement curve for the heavier vehicle will translate into higher force levels for the heavier vehicle (of mass mLTV) than for the lighter vehicle (of mass mCAR). Thus the front end force of the LTV (of mass mLTV) will be higher than the front end force of the car (of mass mCAR where mLTV &gt; mCAR). The same conclusions apply to a 921</page><page sequence="3">large car since its mass is higher than that of a smaller car. However, if the test condition were to be a moving barrier impacting a stationary vehicle, the results will be different as shown in Fig 2. In this case, the kinetic energy prior to the crash is that of the moving barrier (of mass mbarr) and is the same for any vehicle regardless of the vehicle mass. Thus, the frontal force generated by each vehicle in this test will be the same under the assumption of equal crush space Figure 2: Moving barrier crash into vehicles These conclusions apply to the case of full frontal impact (as in NCAP) as well as to offset frontal (such as in ODB) tests. In either case, the use of 'fixed barrier + moving vehicle' test configuration will lead to the front structure of heavier vehicles being designed to withstand and thus generate, higher force levels than will be the case for lighter vehicles, other factors being the same. As stated previously, this assumption of 'other factors being the same' is generally valid since the available crush space is dependent on the front-end packaging of the vehicle and not on its mass. It should be noted that one of the criteria used in rating vehicles in the ODB (40 mph, 40% offset) test is the deformation of the passenger compartment as measured by the toe pan movement during the test. Thus, reducing the toe pan displacement is one of the means of achieving higher rating for the vehicle structure. This effectively means lower values of crush distance available, raising further the force levels that the front structures have to be designed for. The effect is that improving scores in the ODB test will likely lead to higher front-end force levels for the same vehicle. This should be considered as a compounding factor to the previously mentioned effect of fixed barrier test procedures driving front-end force levels to be higher for heavier vehicles. To test the validity of the above logic, we examined the available data for possible relationships between the current front impact criteria and the peak force levels. Shown in Fig. 3 are the force-displacement curves obtained in front NCAP tests of two mid-size sports utility vehicles. As compared to the vehicle marked as 'previous', the force levels for the vehicle marked as 'current' (which has a higher mass and improved performance in the ODB test) are found to be higher. Figure 3: Force versus crush distance comparisons Other data available in literature and through NHTSA's web site lead to similar conclusions for various vehicles. In their paper, Meyerson et al (2) compared the force levels generated by two versions of their test vehicle - the later version of the vehicle incorporated several modifications that improved the vehicle's performance in the ODB test. The data cited in their paper show that the improved vehicle has peak accelerations 30-40% higher than that for the older version of the same vehicle. With a linear relationship between vehicle acceleration and the peak force levels, this translates into higher force levels for the improved vehicle and agrees with the conclusion that this test procedure leads to front ends having higher force levels with improving performance. Figure 4 is shown to establish a relationship between the force data obtained in fixed, rigid barrier tests (NCAP tests) and those obtained in fixed ODB tests (as conducted by IIHS). The plot here is of the acceleration at the vehicle e.g. which can be translated into force levels by multiplying these values by the vehicle mass. As seen here, the current ODB test procedure generates lower force levels during early part of the impact. It should be noted that this is due to the significant amount of deformable, hexcel material which comprises the front 922</page><page sequence="4">part of the ODB test barrier and which crushes at relatively low force levels. The peak forces occur later in the ODB crash tests than in the rigid barrier NCAP tests. This should be taken into account in examining the data cited in reference (2) and the comparisons should be based on the peak forces generated in each test and not just on the earlier part of the force-time plot. Shown in figure 5 are ODB test data for another set of vehicles. The acceleration levels at the vehicle eg were converted to estimated force levels by multiplying by the appropriate fraction of the vehicle's mass. Figure 4: Acceleration vs Time plot - NCAP and ODB Figure 5: Comparison of force versus deflection data for vehicle The trend of higher front-end forces for heavier vehicles is also observed when the velocity-versus-time plots ('velocity pulse') of the two versions of this vehicle are examined as in figure 6 below. The new vehicle with improved ratings in ODB test has a 'stiffer' pulse and shorter crush distance. As mentioned earlier, the term 'stiffer' is used here to denote a structure which is capable of higher levels of force. Figure 6: Comparison of Velocity pulse Both the cases cited above are for medium sized sports utility vehicles (in the US market segment). Similar data exists for other vehicles. Figure 7 shows the comparison of the force data for two version of a small car. 923</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7 : Comparison of force levels for a small car Figure 8 is the comparison of the 'velocity pulse' for the small car in the same two tests. Both these figures lead to the same conclusion as stated previously - vehicles that have improved performance in ODB tests have become significantly stiffer in the front end and generate higher force levels overall. Figure 8: Comparison of velocity pulse for a small car Shown in Fig. 9 is data from NCAP tests for several vehicles of model years 1998 to 2002. During this period, all major automobile manufacturers have used NCAP Figure 9: Vehicle mass versus force levels performance targets in designing their vehicles. The results shown here are from tests conducted by NHTSA. The force values are obtained by a linear fit of the peak values in the crash data and represent an averaged peak rather than any one point in the result. The data show the relationship of the 'average' peak force values to the vehicle mass. A 'linear fit' is also shown on this plot and it is evident that a strong relationship exists between the vehicle mass and the peak forces that it generates in frontal crash. RELATIONSHIP OF NCAP RATING TO CRASH STATISTICS The New Car Assessment Program was initiated to encourage automobile manufacturers to improve safety beyond what is achieved by regulatory standards. Based on results obtained in crash tests conducted at 35 mph against a fixed, rigid barrier, vehicles are rated from one star (least safe) to five stars (most safe). Kahane et al (10) analyzed crash data for car-to-car crashes for 1978- 1991 from Fatal Accident Reporting System. One of the key points in the above-mentioned paper is that the authors' comparison of observed driver fatalities in 924</page><page sequence="6">'good' and 'poor' cars, adjusting for the age and sex of the drivers and the weights of their vehicles. The authors divided the cars into 'good' and 'poor' categories in three different ways based on HIC and chest Gs. The study came to the conclusion that in these cases, a difference could be shown to exist between the two categories of cars. However, using the equations presented by the authors, it is possible to find either a relatively large difference (no adjustment), a more modest difference (authors' full model) or virtually no difference (adjusting for car mass only) between cars with 'good' or 'poor' NCAP performance depending on how one chooses to adjust the data for real differences in vehicle/driver characteristics. For example, consider Case I ('good' is HIC &lt; 1000 and Chest Gs &lt; 60), which yielded the largest number of crashes (170). Using the Case I definitions, the observed number of driver fatalities in 'good' cars was 19.8% lower than in 'poor' cars (89 versus 111). Simply plugging the average car weights into the authors' formulae (other things being equal), the risk for the 'good' cars is 18.3% lower than for 'poor' cars. In other words, there is virtually no difference between the 'good' and 'poor' cars that couldn't be attributed to car weight alone. But apparently the drivers of the 'good' cars were older and/or more likely to be female than the drivers of the 'poor' cars, because the reported difference in expected risk is only 7.3% (96.2 expected driver fatalities for 'good' versus 103.8 for 'poor'). It should be also remarked that during this period, most manufacturers introduced airbags into passenger cars and this may be a large contributing factor in the improvements seen in the crash statistics for "good" vehicles. It is necessary to separate this effect in order to conclusively identify the improvements in safety that may be attributable to improved NCAP rating alone. More recent (1995-1999) data from the Fatal Accident Reporting System are examined below for several different vehicle segments. These are for reported fatalities of the driver when the direction of the crash was frontal and the driver was wearing seatbelts. Shown below are data for small cars (Fig 10), mid-size cars (Fig. 11), large cars (Fig. 12), mid-size utility vehicles (Fig. 13), mid-size vans (Fig. 14) and large pick-up vehicles (Fig. 15). Figure 10: Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; SMALL CARS Figure 11 : Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MID SIZE CARS Similar data exist for front seat passengers in these vehicles. Each figure shows the rate of fatality per ten thousand registered vehicle years for a specific make of vehicle with the star rating as published by NHTSA. Also shown in each figure is the mean value for the particular star rating. Figure 12: Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; LARGE CARS 925</page><page sequence="7">Figure 13: Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MID SIZE UTILITIES Figure 14: Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MEDIUM VANS Figure 15: Fatality Rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; LARGE PICK UPS The above data do not show any clear relationship between the frontal NCAP performance of a vehicle and its fatality statistics. Since these data are for the period when all the major manufacturers had already introduced airbags in their cars, they are not confounded by some of the other factors mentioned above in discussing the work by Kahane et al (10). To further explore the existence of any possible relationship, crash statistics for fatal as well as incapacitating injuries available from six states (AL 1994-1999; FL 1994-1999; ID 1994-1999; MD 1994- 1999; MO 1994-1998; NC 1994-1999; NY 1994-1999) were examined. These results are shown below for the same vehicle segments as before. In each case, the plots show the rate of fatal (called "K") or incapacitating (called "A") injuries for the vehicle makes along with the NCAP star rating of the vehicles. Also shown are the mean values for each category. In this case, it was possible to study the rate of these injuries per 100 occupants that were involved in these crashes. Figure 16: Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; SMALL CARS Figure 17: Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MID SIZE CARS 926</page><page sequence="8">Figure 18: Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; LARGE CARS Figure 19: Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MIDSIZE UTILITIES Figure 20: Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; MEDIUM VANS Figure 21 : Injury rate for belted drivers; frontal crashes; LARGE PICK UPS There is no observed correlation here as well between the rate of fatal/disabling injuries and the frontal NCAP rating of the vehicles. These results are significant since they are not confounded by the absence of airbags in some of the vehicles and also because they examine the broad spectrum of front-end collisions rather than a subset chosen to closely match the NCAP test conditions (10). Also, the present study includes LTVs, as contrasted to the previous studies. No overall benefit in terms of fatalities and/or major injuries is observed from having a higher NCAP rating. As an example of improvements that are attributable to a consumer metrics test, similar data for new car assessment program in lateral impacts (LINCAP) is presented in figure 22. Since this test uses a moving deformable barrier impacting into the side of the vehicle, the performance is independent of the mass of the test vehicle and it is possible to look at the data congregated to represent all vehicles. Results show that the vehicles that have higher LINCAP ratings show reduced likelihood of occupant injuries. 927</page><page sequence="9">Figure 22: LINCAP Ratings vs Major/Fatal Injuries DISCUSSION The issue of collision compatibility between large and small vehicles is a multifaceted one and will require evaluation of steps for the both the striking vehicle and the struck vehicles to assess improved safety. One of the aspects that needs to be examined for this is the effect of existing regulatory and non-regulatory requirements on collision compatibility. The existing crashworthiness regulations as well as the consumer information tests for automobiles were developed several years ago to enhance the self- protection of vehicles and they did not consider the issue of any possible effect on the collision compatibility between vehicles of different sizes. As the vehicle population becomes more diverse in size and mass and includes growing numbers of LTVs, this issue of compatibility will assume relatively larger significance and needs to be taken into account in establishing measures to reduce the total number of serious and fatal injuries. This may necessitate re-evaluation of the existing test procedures and their possible modifications to ensure that the changes in the fleet composition are accounted for.
