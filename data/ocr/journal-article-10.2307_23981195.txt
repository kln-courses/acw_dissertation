<plain_text><page sequence="1">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz ARND BÖHM Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada Klopstock and J.M.R. Lenz? At first glance, the connection might seem tenu ous. Yet Brecht, with the acuity of poetic insight, gave considerable emphasis to Klopstock in the revision of Lenz's Der Hofmeister. He substantially al tered and expanded the bedroom scene with Fritz and Gustchen by replacing the allusions to Romeo and Juliet in Lenz's original with quotations from one of Klopstock's odes. Apprehensive lest they be found in a compromising situa tion, Fritz and Gustchen linger in reading some particularly vivid passages: Fritz: Nein, nein der Papa ist vorbeigegangen! Lies! Gustchen liest: &lt;Ruh' hier, daß ich den Schweiß der Stirn abtrockne Und der Wange das Blut! Wie glüht die Wange! Hermann, Hermann, so hat dich Niemals Thusnelda geliebtb Ach Fritz! &lt;Selbst nicht, da du zuerst im Eichenschatten Mit dem bräunlichen Arm mich wilder faßtest! Fliehend blieb ich und sah dir Schon die Unsterblichkeit an&gt; Fritz: Gustchen ..., The shared reading stirs their emotions and here propels them into swearing an oath of loyalty. The revision offers not only a more cogent account of the psychology of reception than the brief mention by Lenz of Shakespearean themes, but also one that is more historically accurate. This was the sort of in fluence that Klopstock had upon readers of the eighteenth century. Beyond giving a more intense portrayal within the drama, Brecht has gestured to the problem of Lenz's own reception of Klopstock. The furtive reading shared by Fritz and Gustchen is inscribed as a moment of rebellion against one father figure - the one who might be listening in the corridor - at the price of sub mission to the authority of Klopstock's, representing the blatant pa triarchalism of the «Nordism» admired and imitated by the Sturm und Drang authors and reflected in Klopstock's «Hermann» dramas.2 The use Brecht makes of the Klopstock quotations is entirely apt, so much so that it raises the question for us of why Lenz had not done likewise. Brecht has cleverly</page><page sequence="2">212 Arnd Böhm pointed to the absence of Klopstock, one made all the more troubling by the subtle autobiographical undertones of Der Hofmeister. While one cannot push Brecht's revision too hard as evidence of Lenz's relationship to Klop stock, he has performed a valuable service in prompting a closer examination of the question. Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock was born in 1724 and outlived Lenz by eleven years, dying only in 1803. Klopstock was without doubt the most im portant German poet of his age, in the eyes of eighteenth-century contem poraries, despite the impressions created by the subsequent decline of his rep utation in the nineteenth century.3 The question of Lenz's relationship to Klopstock is something one could expect to play a major role in Lenz's bio graphy, and indeed has occasionally been discussed.4 Oddly enough, the lit erature focused on Klopstock is largely silent on this matter, unlike in the case of Goethe or Hölderlin.5 The general impact of Klopstock on the younger generation, presumably including Lenz, has been noted.6 Lenz is also men tioned by Richard Quabius in a list of some who read Klopstock at a rather early age.7 Such evidence as there is, including Goethe's well-known report from Dichtung und Wahrheit, suggests that reading Der Messias made a pro found and lasting impression on an entire generation.8 But what can be said about Lenz's particular relationship to Klopstock? The thesis here will be that Klopstock was extremely important as a factor in Lenz's development as a poet. Or rather, that Klopstock's presence prevented Lenz from becoming an autonomous, authoritative literary figure in his own lifetime. When advancing such a claim, one is immediately met with several possible rejoinders. First, there is the matter of Lenz's relationship to Goethe, long a stable topic in the history of Lenz reception.9 It is important to distin guish Goethe's condescending view of Lenz, especially as coloured by the «Eseley,»10 from Lenz's own understanding of their relationship. In the com petiton for literary prestige, Lenz accepted Goethe to be more or less his equal, as in the poem «Über die deutsche Dichtkunst.»11 A second issue arises from Lenz's shift to drama, where indeed he was to make his major impres sion on German literature, and where he was deeply influenced by Shakespeare.12 Here it is important to marshall the facts in sequence. Lenz's enduring fame as a dramatist was only established long after his death.13 On the other hand, drama was not the basis for Klopstock's fame. Thus the re spective merits of Klopstock and Lenz as dramatists are not in contention. Also to the point is that in the eighteenth century playwrights still ranked below poets in the literary pantheon. This was reinforced for the Germans by the lack of a national theater, so that the best chance of becoming a famous German author was still via epic poems (later supplanted by epic prose).</page><page sequence="3">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 213 Finally, there is the question of evidence. If positive influence is hard to pin down, negative influence is more difficult to detect and to demonstrate, for it often leaves only elusive traces. Nevertheless, the few but strategic mentions by Lenz of Klopstock leave little doubt that over the course of an unhappy literary career Lenz was aware of and measuring himself against Klopstock. To begin in the middle: it is around 1774 that Lenz's references to him become more frequent, to judge by the extant documents. This is not surprising, for in 1774 considerable excitement had been caused by the publication of Klop stock's Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik.14 In a letter of November 18,1775 to his father, Lenz appears to be in the company of those, like Goethe, who felt that they were insiders when it came to understanding Klopstock's intentions: Klopstocks Republik ist eine verborgene Geschichte u. Gesetzbuch der deutschen Dichter u. der deutschen Kritick. Alle diese Dunkelheiten waren nothwendig, nur niemand öffentl. zu beleidigen. {WuB 3: 352) This is not the only indication that Lenz had read and absorbed the lessons of Klopstocks's important theoretical work. An epigram by Lenz specifically defended the Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik-. Klopstocks Gelehrten Republik Ein Götterhaft Gerüst Der Menschen Tun zu adeln Wer darf, wer mag da tadeln? Antwort: Wems unersteiglich ist. {WuB 3: 307)15 Because it is in the nature of epigrams to be concentrated comments, this one requires some unpacking in order for its contextual meaning to become clearer. Among other things, Klopstock's Gelehrtenrepublik was a chart of the distribution of fame and the construction of hierarchy in the world of let ters. The epigram takes aim at critics who, whether because of disinterest or incompetence, are unable to master the literary game. (Lenz's father would be reckoned among them). Those who criticized Klopstock's text were therefore announcing themselves as unworthy to participate in literary affairs. Lenz is careful to dissociate himself from such critics, yet without subscribing fully to Klopstock's position. Somewhat more equivocation may be detected in another epigram, written at about the same time: Uber die Dunkelheiten im Klopstock und andern Der Schmecker Ich bitte gebt mir Licht Herr ich versteh euch nicht Antwort:</page><page sequence="4">214 Arnd Böhm Sobald Ihr mich versteht Herr, bin ich ein schlechter Poet. (WuB 3: 307) The epigram seems to sympathize with Klopstock's aesthetics, especially his theory of the sublime and of the poet's privileged role in transmitting the sub lime to readers. The punchline suggests that incomprehensibility is a measure of the poet's greatness, but the wit could easily be reversed. For, once the sub lime poet has become domesticated and no longer poses challenges for read ers, he too would join the inferior poets. Since Lenz already presumed to have an understanding of Klopstock, the possibility arises that the epigram has some aspects of an epitaph upon a formerly great poet. Further signs of tension in the depiction of Klopstock appear in the Pandd monium Germanicum, written in 1775 but withheld by Lenz from publica tion during his lifetime. The gestures of this work are part of a complex re sponse to the analysis of literary discourse and its space as found in Klop stock's Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik. Against the abstracted utopianism in Klopstock's account, Lenz retold the story as a satire in the immediacy of lan guage and vividness of imagery typical to him. The use of real names allowed Lenz to work in some interesting twists. Who else but Goethe should be heard declaring Klopstock's supremacy on the Parnassian heights? Goethe sich umsehend: Lenz! Lenz! daß er da wäre - Welch herrliche Aussicht! - Da - o da steht Klopstock. Wie daß ich ihn von unten nicht wahrnahm? Ich will zu ihm. Er deucht mich auszuruhen auf dem Ellbogen gestützt. Edler Mann! wie wird's dich freuen jemand Lebendiges hier zu sehn. (WuB 1:248-249) It is Goethe who is clambering up to join Klopstock, who could not «see» him from below, could not fully appreciate his position. Conversely, who else but Lenz receives Klopstock's benediction? This occurs during the scene which reviews the history of the modernization of the theater. Lessing, Her der and Klopstock have been assembled. First Weiße is dismissed along with imitations of the French, then Shakespeare arrives and throws an arm around Klopstock. Having symbolically passed through the historical development of German dramatic theory in the eighteenth century, the action turns to Lenz. In response to Lessing's «Und unser heutiges Trauerspiel?» Lenz, launches into a précis of his theory and a defence of his plays: Die Leiden griechischer Helden sind für uns bürgerlich, die Leiden unserer sollten sich einer verkannten und duldenden Gottheit nähern. Oder führtet ihr Leiden der Alten auf, so wären es biblische, wie dieser tat (Klopstock ansehend), Leiden wie der Götter, wenn eine höhere Macht ihnen entgegenwirkt. (WuB 1: 269) Klopstock responds by pronouncing «Gott segne dich.» However, Lenz considers himself unworthy and withdraws, at which point Klopstock, Her</page><page sequence="5">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 215 der and Lessing declare in unison «Der brave Junge. Leistet er nichts, so hat er doch groß geahndet» (WuB 1: 269). Shielded by the conventions of satire, Lenz has awarded himself the laurels of the future from the hands of Klop stock. Goethe appears as an interloper, stepping in to share some of the good words being spoken about Lenz, but the sequence makes it clear that the pan theon had chosen Lenz, not Goethe, to be the legitimate successor for su premacy in the literary realm. Not incidentally, Klopstock has been depicted as presuming his own anachronicity: only the younger Lenz will be able to complete the program of providing exemplary heros for the modern world, for he alone has glimpsed them in theory. On the other hand, we also notice the fact that Lenz withdraws from the precinct in which his self-appropria tion of fame took place. The swerve away from the very figure who has awarded him the laurels - Klopstock - is motivated by more than decorous modesty, for it reflects the structural contradiction in Lenz's relationship to a literary father. The observation about Lenz's displacement of Klopstock as already passé, if only in the world of satire, is borne out by a passage in the «Anmerkungen über das Theater.» Lenz claimed there: Die Italiener hatten einen Dante, die Engelländer Shakespearen, die Deutschen Klopstock, welche das Theater schon aus ihrem eigenen Gesichtspunkt ansahen, nicht durch Aristoteles' Prisma [...]. Was Shakespeare und Klopstock in seinem Bar diet getan, wissen wir alle [...]. (WuB 2:658-659) Even while acknowledging Klopstock's contribution, Lenz does so as if Klopstock were already in the past tense. Both Dante and Shakespeare are classical representatives of their literatures and could be assessed historically - but when Lenz wrote these words Klopstock was still alive, still active. Re markable is how the past tense verbal forms «hatten» and «getan» deny Klop stock's ongoing role in the German literary scene. Respect is mingled with in solence, for who could presume in 1776 that Klopstock would not go on to produce other decisive transformations in literary practice, comparable to the impact of Der Messias? Further evidence of Lenz's exclusion of Klopstock from the canon of famous national poets is provided in the poem «Über die deutsche Dichtkunst,» written in 1774 or 1775. Lamenting the death of «er habne Gedanken» in «Deutschland,» Lenz invokes the expected list minus Klopstock: O Homer, o Ossian, o Shakespear, O Dante, o Ariosto, o Petrarca, O Sophokles, o Milton, o ihr untern Geister - O Ihr Pope, ihr Horaz, ihr Polizian, ihr Prior, ihr Waller, Gebt mir tausend Zungen für die tausend Namen,</page><page sequence="6">216 Arnd Böhm Und jeder Name ist ein kühner Gedanke - Ein Gedanke - tausend Gedanken Unsrer heutigen Dichter wert. (WuB 3:115) The poem goes on to suggest Lenz and Goethe as the only two geniuses left in the land; Klopstock is not mentioned. But occluding Klopstock does not lead to Lenz's ultimate triumph, for by the conclusion of the poem he is found not worthy of fame. The anxiety of influence is vividly reflected in the image of the burning gaze of the father-poets: Schütze mein einsames Grab Daß kein Blick aus dem Reiche der Seligen Von Shakespears brennendem Aug Oder dem düsterleuchtenden Auge Ossians Oder dem rotblitzenden Auge Homers Sich auf dasselbe verirre. (WuB 3: 117) Conspicuous by its absence is the name contemporaries might have associ ated immediately with «Ossian»: Klopstock. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it is consistent in revealing a Lenz who was torn in his attitude towards the poet whom he also referred to in one letter as «Vater Klop stock.»17 Evidence of Lenz's relationship to Klopstock may also be seen in two other areas, in the founding of the «Deutsche Gesellschaft» in Strasbourg and in his attacks on Wieland. Some years ago, Allan G. Blunden questioned the import of Lenz's efforts to set up the «Deutsche Gesellschaft.» We should not, he ar gued, place too much emphasis on the political ramifications of the project: «Certainly, Lenz's works and correspondence contain scarcely anything that could be called an explicit political opinion or judgment.»18 The difficulty with this is that there was in the German territories of the eighteenth century no discourse which could be considered «political» by the standards of the Anglo-American sphere. But the founding of the «Deutsche Gesellschaft» was rife, as Blunden goes on to discuss, with «patriotic» implications. Not least, the inclusion of Strasbourg, with its combination of German and French communities, in the network of «Deutsche Gesellschaften» was pro vocative, as was the debate initiated by Lenz on the priority of the German language. Both the society and the plans for language reform were immediate consequences of Klopstock's activities. A signal for the revival of Gottsched's network of «Deutsche Gesellschaften» had come from Klopstock himself. In 1775, he had been invited to Karlsruhe by Karl Friedrich of Baden and had been instrumental in getting a learned society underway in Mannheim.19 The «Deutsche Gesellschaften» had moved beyond Gottsched's aims of the Früh aufklärung and were now construed as part of Klopstock's attempts to inter</page><page sequence="7">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 217 vene in the affairs of the Holy Roman Empire via the promulgation of the «German Republic of Letters.» The most radical proposition was the claim that through language reform and literary academies a new unified «Deutsch land» would overcome the constitutional crises, marked by extreme fragmen tation, of the late Holy Roman Empire. Precisely such an exorbitant intention was articulated by Lenz in his talk of November 2, 1775 to the Strasbourg society, where he aligned himself with the practical program of Klopstock's Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik: Wenn also diejenigen Provinzen Deutschlands, in denen sich noch die meisten Überreste der gotischen Sprache und Denkart erhalten haben, mit denen zusammen träten [his emphasis], die von unsem Nachbaren schon das Gepräge angenommen, wenn jede berühmte Stadt Deutschlandes Beiträge zu einem Idiotikon gäbe, das mehr auf die urältesten Wörter und deren Bedeutungen als auf die heutigüblichen sähe, und sodann auf einem Klopstockischen Landtage der ältesten und einsichts vollsten Gelehrten jedes Orts auf ein Vereinigungsmittel, auf einen nicht einseitigen despotischen, sondern republikanischen Sprachgebrauch gedacht würde - unsere Sprache wie ein Baum der seine Wurzeln im ganzen Vaterlande ausgebreitet hat, und von allen Orten her gleichmäßigen Zufluß der Säfte empfängt, würde von den Winden der Mode und des Leichtsinns nichts zu befürchten haben. (WuB 2: 774 775) Despite the rhetoric of republicanism and anti-despotism, Lenz had followed Klopstock too closely in the distribution of power according to nationalist interests. As is evident from the records of the group's meetings, the Franco phone contingent was rather uneasy with the insistence upon the supremacy of German.20 Well they might be, for in extending the domain of German lit erature into a contested bilingual zone, Lenz had gone beyond patriotism and language purism on the path to imperialism.21 On the western frontier where French and German dialects overlapped with each other, Lenz was respond ing with the anxieties of a German from the eastern frontier, where the instal lation of language had for centuries been concomitant with expansion of do minion. In doing so, he was also demonstrating that he could contribute to the realization of the sweeping social and political changes that Klopstock had proposed but not yet been able to implement.22 Lenz's attacks on Wieland were further signals of a desire to be allied with Klopstock in the mid-1770's. Members of the Göttingen Hainbund had burned Wieland's writings;23 Lenz erased him from the canon, leaving him out of the Parnassus of Pandämonium Germanicum. The principle underly ing Lenz's antipathy may be read in the «Verteidungung des Herrn W gegen die Wolken» (1776), which again analyzes literature in the language of Klop stock's Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik. Whereas Klopstock was supposed to be</page><page sequence="8">218 Arnd Böhm an advocate of «republicanism» in literature, Wieland is presented as a mo nopolizer who harms the economy of discourse: Sobald einer allein das Geheimnis besitzt, durch gewisse Reize, die sich andere oft nicht erlauben können, öfter aber nicht erlauben wollen, den großen Haufen Lacher auf seine Seite zu ziehen, und sodann nur das Geschmack nennt, was in seinen Kram gehört, das heißt, was seine anderweitigen eigennützigen Absichten beför dert, so ist dieses Monopolium gerade der Untergang alles wahren Geschmacks und ein gräßlicher Rabe, der dem nahen Winter entgegen kräht. Mag er alsdenn für seine Person ein noch so trefflicher Mensch sein, er ist der Republik gefährlich [...]. (WuB 2: 716) Further on in the text, Klopstock's authority is invoked directly when Lenz opens the attack on the self-legitimation of critics as representatives of public opinion: Wenn nun diese mit den allergrößten Anmaßungen von der Welt, und immer, wie Herr Klopstock unbezahlbar erinnert hat, anstatt ihre einseitige [his emphasis] Stimme zu geben, mit einem Egoismus, der alle Grenzen der Schamhaftigkeit über steigt, und eben deswegen ungerügt bleibt, als Repräsentanten der ganzen Nation sprechen [...]. (WuB 2: 722) It is not surprising that Lenz could fully expect Wieland to receive such an outspoken adherent of the Klopstock camp rather coldly in Weimar. But in an about-face, Lenz now accepted Wieland as an ally. Wieland's tolerant attitude made the accommodation easier. Although Lenz had been worried about what sort of welcome he would receive in Weimar, he was able to report to Friedrich Leopold von Stolberg that Wieland's reaction was an unexpected warmth: Sie werden begierig seyn zu wissen, wie Wieland mich empfangen hat, Wieland der einzige unter allen Menschen, den ich vorsätzlich und öffentlich beleidigt habe. Se hen Sie da, ob sein Benehmen gegen mich nicht des menschenfreundlichsten Philo sophen würdig ist. Als ich ihn das erstemal sähe, machte die zutrauenvolle vergnüg te Bewegung, mit der er mich grüßte, mich schon wirre; es war, als ob's ihm jemand gesagt hätte, ich sey um seinetwillen gekommen, obschon wir uns nur auf der Straße antrafen.24 Aside from Lenz's frank admission of his earlier partisan role in the Klop stock-Wieland opposition, the passage is interesting for the light it sheds on Lenz's mercurial ability to shift allegiances. This suggests that it was not a specific content of literary authority that drew him but the authority as such. There could be no fundamental contradiction for Lenz in switching loyalty to Wieland from Klopstock, since it kept the principle of hierarchy intact. In the event, Lenz had little choice but to accept one or another mentor. Wieland</page><page sequence="9">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 219 was influential, had not been the target for Lenz s first adulation, and could be counterpoised against Klopstock. That a turn to Wieland still meant subordi nation seems to have been a price he was willing to accept. Having traced the indications of how Lenz identified and sided with Klop stock, it is possible to notice something strange in the relationship. This emerges from a consideration of Lenz's letter to Lavater on April 8, 1775, where he reported: Klopstock ist auch wieder nach Hause gekehrt zu seinen alten Freunden, ich hatt' ihn so nahe und sah ihn nicht. So waltet ein uns unbekantes Schiksal über unsre liebsten heiligen Wünsche und Neigungen und leitet sie nach seinen Absichten. (WuB 3: 309) One might simply take him at face value and sigh with Lenz / Hamlet about the misfortune that kept him from meeting the famous man. Or one might wonder why Lenz did not make more of an effort to seek out Klopstock, whether in Karlsruhe, in Weimar or in Göttingen? Why, if it was a consum mation he devoutly wished, did Lenz not visit Klopstock anywhere? Espe cially after both Lenz and Klopstock had been banned from the little world of Weimar in 1776, the younger man might have joined the poet whom he had once emulated. In order to explain why Lenz could not have done so, why in fact he ulti mately veered away from Klopstock, going east to Moscow rather than north to Hamburg, it is necessary to re-consider one of Lenz's earliest writings, the «Versöhnungstod Jesu Christi.» Rosanow listed some of the signs of Klop stock's influence upon the poem: in the vocabulary, style, rhetorical colour ing, imagery and metre. In sum, «Der Einfluß Klopstocks war die erste Tat sache von entscheidender Bedeutung für die literarische Entwicklung Len zens» (40). Left unstated is the assumption that this imitation was a normal phase in the literary development of a young poet. But since the publication of Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence (1973), we are alerted to the troubles of influence and to the extraordinary ramifications of Lenz's adop tion of Klopstock as a precursor.25 The decisive insight of Bloom's theory is that poetic imitation can never be a unidirectional flow of influence, but always contains a moment of reversal, a moment of rebellion against the genealogy of canonical forebears. Strong poets are, according to Bloom, «... major figures with the persistence to wrestle with their strong precursors, even to the death. Weaker talents ideal ize; figures of capable imagination appropriate for themselves» (5). Tradition ally, European poets had constructed their literary roles by inserting them selves into the sequence of great poets. Orpheus-Homer-Virgil were shared by everyone; after that national literatures branched off at various points,</page><page sequence="10">220 Arnd Böhm • such as Dante, Chaucer or Cervantes. Until the eighteenth century, the Ger mans were quite self-conscious about the fact that they had produced no great modern poet. This was the accomplishment of Klopstock (who was of course supplanted soon after by Goethe). By measuring himself against Klop stock, the young Lenz - he was only fifteen - was confronting the precursor who had only recently been enthroned as the supreme German poet. Follow ing Bloom's reading, this would reveal in Lenz at least the desire to be a strong poet in his own right, for he was audacious enough to compare himself with the best. But Bloom also points to the source of Lenz's ultimate defeat. What holds for the English is also true for the German literature of the eighteenth cen tury: «If one examines the dozen or so major poetic influencers before this century, one discovers quickly who among them ranks as the great Inhibitor, the Sphinx who strangles even the strongest imaginations in their cradles: Milton» (32). No less than for Wordsworth or Coleridge,26 Milton was the archetype to be both imitated and overcome by German poets, at least if they were Protestants. Milton had succeeded in fulfilling the requirements of both poetry and theology, producing an exemplary modernization of Christian epic. Klopstock, in writing Der Messias, had self-consciously undertaken to imitate Milton and also to go beyond him, by versifying the New Testament and thereby bringing German poetry to the forefront among European national literatures.27 Certainly in the eyes of his German audience, Klop stock was eminently successful.28 This success imposed constraints on Lenz, both by what it required of and by what it prohibited for a young poet. Required was a demonstration that the successor could also wrestle with Milton and win, for that was the positive sign of poetic greatness reconfirmed by Klopstock's work. Another Christian epic was needed. But at the same time, the new poem had to transcend Klop stock's example so definitively that it would be more than just another ver sion. As it turned out, Lenz did not manage to differentiate himself suffi ciently from the model. Theodor Oldekop, who was responsible for the pub lication of the poem, tellingly defended Lenz against the obvious comparison: Kenner werden bald bemerken, daß die Klopstockische [his emphasis] Muse ihn be geistert habe. Es ist wahr, er hat mit Empfindung gelesen, aber nicht ausgeschrieben. Ein solches seltenes Genie verdient alle Aufmunterung. (WuB 3: 777) Lenz's dependence was all too obvious, and subsequent readers have stressed it as a flaw.29 Why did Lenz make such a poor decision as to imitate Klopstock on ter rain so solidly occupied? For one thing, there was little freedom of choice in</page><page sequence="11">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 221 the subjects left after Milton and Klopstock had done with Scripture. The classical epics were contaminated by romance; nordic mythology, which would later serve Richard Wagner, was only beginning to be re-invented. We know who did manage to find a suitable material in the Faust story. But Lenz tried valiantly to return to the Biblical material, even though Klopstock held the copyright at the time, so to speak. Another major factor was Lenz's im mersion in the intensely religious environment dominated by his father Christian David Lenz. It is reported that the father would tolerate no poetry except that of Klopstock: Der Vater verachtete alle profane Poesie und trug selbst eine heilige Scheu vor dem Gebrauch derselben zu religiösen Zwecken, wenn sie sich nicht als entschieden fromm bewährte. Als ein wahrer Dichter war ihm Klopstock erschienen, dessen ho hen Geist er unbedingt verehrte; er war ihm ein Auserwählter, und nur wenige Menschen konnten berufen seyn, einen ähnlichen Weg zu betreten. Er dachte sich den Dichter als einen großen Gelehrten, einen heiligen Menschen, der seine von hö heren Berufsgeschäften freien Stunden wohl zu poetischen Produktionen verwen den darf, dem diese aber immer Nebensache bleiben müssen.30 It is highly probable that Christian David Lenz would have communicated his opinions about Klopstock, which were also a theory of the role poetry could play in a Christian life, most forcefully to his son. The opening was given: by assuming the stance and voice of «Klopstock,» Lenz could take advantage of one of the few opportunities for self-expression permitted in his father s household. The imitation of Klopstock was thus implicated in Lenz's relationship to two figures of authority, out of whose dissonance slipped the possibility for autonomy. But Christian David Lenz did not want the son to dedicate his life to poetry or similar frivolous pursuits. Nevertheless, J.M.R. Lenz assumed the risk and let his effort be published. Had the «Ver söhnungstod Jesu Christi» at one stroke made him famous, he could have been vindicated in his gesture of rebellion against both the biological and the spiritual fathers. It was not to be. Whether even the strongest poet could have accomplished what Lenz had set out to do seems doubtful. Klopstock was not about to withdraw from lit erary activity; Christian David Lenz never relented in his forbidding patri archalism. Linking and complicating the problem in the ill-fated effort is the fact that the «Versöhnungstod Jesu Christi» had to be about the very topic of stern fathers and rebellious sons. Given the episode Lenz had chosen to turn into verse, it was unavoidable that the frustration and desires of the son inter mingled with those of the depicted Son. An incredible knot of emotions came together to produce the following lines:</page><page sequence="12">222 Arndt Böhm Wie wenn der blühende Knabe voll Unschuld, auf seinem Lager An der Seite des besten Vaters von Träumen geschreckt wird. Und auf dem stürmenden Meere von brausenden Wellen geschleudert, Seinen Retter und Vater, der ihm die Hand reicht, verlieret: Oder, wenn er im Traume, vom Gipfel des höchsten Gebirges Mit dem rollenden Sande schnell weggerissen, herabstürzt, Und vergeblich den Vater, der ihn nicht helfen kann, anschreit, Dann plötzlich erwacht, und zitternd den Vater erblicket, Dann mit zärtlichen Tränen ihn kindlich umhalset und küsset, Und halb Wehmut halb Freude: Wo warst du, Vater? ihn anred't So erwachte jetzt Jesus aus den betäubenden Qualen, Rang seine Klagen zum Vater, die Täler hallten sie wieder: Gott mein Gott, warum hattest du mich in der Hölle verlassen! (WuB 3:14-15) The congruent meanings are all too obvious. The extended analogy does not come from Scripture, but has been concocted by Lenz's imagination and ex perience. The suffering of Christ is amplified by a psychology whose origins lie in the repressive household of Christian David Lenz and the anxiety dreams of the adolescent. Yet an overt psychoanalytical interpretation, while called for here, should not obscure the poetological moments in the poem. Concomitant with the outcry for and against the stern patriarchy there is a renunciation of Klop stock, announced by Lenz in the opening lines: Zeit, sei mir heilig, den Sohn im Leiden des Todes zu singen, Tränen fließt in die Lieder, die ich dem Blutigen weihe. Triebe, die David den Sänger und Gottes Herzen beseelten, Wenn er einsame Nächte mit heiligen Lobliedern fei'rte: Die den erleuchteten Geist der Gottes-Propheten entzückten, Sahn sie den Mann unsers Heils in dämmernder Zukunft am Kreuze: Triebe, die durchs klopfende Herz Maria erbebten, Da sie den sterbenden Sohn mit einer Gebärerin Schmerz sah: Seid mir Begleiter wenn ich zum Hügel des Bundes hineile, Den Unsterblichen tot, den Schöpfer gekreuzigt zu sehen. (WuB 3: 8) The parallels with the beginning of Der Messias are less startling than the differences: Sing, unsterbliche Seele, der sündigen Menschen Erlösung, Die der Messias auf Erden in seiner Menschheit vollendet, Und durch die er Adams Geschlechte die Liebe der Gottheit Mit dem Blute des heiligen Bundes von neuem geschenkt hat. Also geschah des Ewigen Wille.31 Klopstock would fill the gaps in the Biblical narrative with material generated according to the precepts of aesthetic and theological traditions. Lenz, how</page><page sequence="13">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R. Lenz 223 ever, has announced a radically different source of inspiration: personal emo tion out of personal experience.32 The «Tränen» and «Triebe» mark the narra tive, in keeping with pietist autobiography, as the poet's own contribution. The authenticating supplement to Scripture is felt experience. The apostrophe to «Zeit» underscores the historicist re-interpretation out of which the in dividual experience outweighs the transcendent gospel. Where Klopstock could still perceive the poet's role as one of mediation between tradition and the audience, Lenz had interposed an autobiographical awareness. Publica tion was now tantamount to confession. Lenz's commitment to the text via personal emotions meant that he had much more of his own self at stake than traditional poetics had required. In replacing literary tradition with personal feelings as the source for poetry, Lenz had anticipated the tactic that would ultimately prevail in the aesthetics of Romanticism. Yet he would fail to establish himself as the legiti mate heir of Klopstock. Or, to drive at the irony, Lenz could never inherit be cause neither Christian David Lenz nor Klopstock cooperated by passing away and leaving the field clear for the son. The dilemma of Lenz was written into the passage quoted above, where Christ pleads with God and vicariously with all authority figures. The power that could help the son is also the agent of repression and the instigator of anxiety. As long as the fathers remained in charge, Lenz would be caught between submission and rebellion. On the bio graphical plane, this was how Lenz and his biological father organized their relationship, with sad consequences. On the literary plane, Lenz yearned for Klopstock's adulation and hoped to displace him, both vain wishes. The benediction pronounced in the Pandämonium Germanicum remained, when all was said and done, only a bitter satirical acceptance that such a signal of re spect could never be realized. Hence the fictional Lenz immediately hurries off, foreshadowing the departure of the actual Lenz away from the centers of German literature to another periphery. It was an effort at autonomy, for the closer Lenz came to mimicking Klopstock in order to replace him, the more he would have been confirming, in the flattery of imitation and the submis sive acceptance of praise, that patriarchal authority from whence his anguish flowed.34 Notes Bertolt Brecht, Gesammelte Werke 6: Stücke, ed.

Kitching also notes the possibility of an allu sion to the well-known moment in Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, when the exclamation «Klopstock!» establishes a meeting of the minds for Werther and Charlotte. Meredith Lee has discussed this scene, and the eighteenth-century reception of Klopstock odes, in ««Klop stock!): Werther, Lotte and the Reception of Klopstock's Odes,» in The Age of Goethe Today: Critical Reexamination and Literary Reflection, ed. Gertrud Bauer Pickar and Sabine Cramer (München: Fink, 1990), 1-11. 2 There is a considerable older literature on «Nordism» and the reception of Ossian in Ger many; see Rudolf Tombo, Ossian in Germany: Bibliography, General Survey, Ossian's In fluence upon Klopstock and the Bards (New York: Columbia UP, 1901). Fiona J. Stafford's The Sublime Savage: A Study of James Macpherson and The Poems of Ossian (Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 1988) discusses the Ossian texts from the perspective of their production, with a brief discussion of reception, pp. 163-180. A re-reading of the phenomenon under the aegis of feminist or new historicist approaches remains to be undertaken. A harsh criticism of the ideological implications of the «Hermann» theme that raises questions relevant to Klopstock's use of the materials, although dealing with Heinrich von Kleist, is Sigurd Burck hardt's, «Kleist's Hermannsschlacht: The Lock and the Key,» in his The Drama of Language: Es says on Goethe and Kleist (Baltimore / London: Johns Hopkins Press, 1970), 116-62; 168-72. 1 On Klopstock's reception after his death, see Harro Zimmermann, Freiheit und Geschichte: F.

The significance for German literary-political discourse at the end of the eighteenth century of Hermann und die Fürsten (1784) and Hermanns Tod (1787) has been reassessed by Zimmer mann, Freiheit und Geschichte 234-68. 17 In a letter to Boie from St. Petersburg on April 5, 1780, he inquired «Was macht also zuför derst Vater Klopstock den ich durch ein Mißgeschick, wie soviele Edle auf meiner Reise habe verfehlen müssen» ( WuB 3: 597). 18 Allan Blunden, «Language and Politics: the Patriotic Endeavours of J.M.R.

[...] Und ist es unstreitig, daß eine Sprache gewählt und folglich auch bearbeitet werden muß, um uns einander vertändlich zu machen, so frage ich jetzt um, welche von allen jetztlebenden Sprachen, meine Herren für tüchtiger zu unsern gemeinsamen Absichten finden als die deutsche» ( WuB 2: 785). No less than in the German-speaking territories, the evaluation of the utility of one language or dialect versus another for purposes of learned discourse or administration was fraught with political over tones, ones that would be articulated forcefully a generation later during the Revolution. For some indications of the French view of the importance of language for power, see the survey by Martyn Lyons, «Regionalism and linguistic conformity in the French Revolution,» in Re shaping France: Town, country and region during the French Revolution, ed. Alan Forrest and Peter Jones (Manchester / New York: Manchester UP, 1991), 179-92. 21 This sentence and the next one depend heavily upon the analyses of Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1983). 22 The problems of the new society are chronicled by Joh. Froitzheim, Zu Strassburgs Sturm und Drangperiode 1770-1776: Urkundliche Forschungen (Strassburg: Heitz, 1888) 18-54. Writing less than twenty years after the Franco-Prussian War, which had fateful con sequences for Alsace, Froitzheim approved of Lenz's German plans in unequivocal terms,</page><page sequence="16">226 Arnd Böhm p. 32: «Wie recht hatte daher Lenz, als er seine elsässische Freunde aufforderte, sich gegenüber der ins Land eindringenden französischen Sprache mit der oberflächlichen Er lernung der deutschen Muttersprache in ihrer Jugendzeit zu begnügen [...].» But the minutes suggest that on several occasions presentations were made in French, so a pragmatic bilingu alism may in fact have operated. 23 On the Göttinger Hainbund and Wieland, see Irmtraut Sahmland, Christoph Martin Wie land und die deutsche Nation: Zwischen Patriotismus, Kosmopolitismus und Griechentum (Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1990) 140-47. 24 Thomas C. Starnes, Christoph Martin Wieland, Leben und Werk, Band 1: «Vom Seraph zum Sittenverderb er,» 1733-1783 (Sigmaringen: Thorbecke, 1987), 579. Lenz's version contrasts nicely with Wieland's, cited ibid. 578: «Bei der ersten Begegnung mit Lenz, rief der junge Dichter aus: &lt;Sind Sie Wieland? - Ich dachte Sie mir mit Hörnern, Krallen, dem Pferdefuß.'» 25 Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (London / New York: Oxford UP, 1973).

Wil loughby (Oxford: Blackwell, 1962) 120-32, here p. 121: «We can pass over his juvenilia.

' Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Der Messias, Gesang I-III: Text des Erstdrucks von 1748, ed. Elisabeth Höpker-Herberg (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1986), 7. Heinz Kindermann,J.M.R. Lenz und die Deutsche Romantik: Ein Kapitel aus der Entwick lungsgeschichte romantischen Wesens und Schaffens (Wien / Leipzig: Braumüller, 1925), was one of the first to stress the impact of pietist psychology upon this poem. «Trotzdem spricht aus dem Gedichte bei allen jugendlichen Schwächen und Übertreibungen ein Ton tiefer re ligiöser Ergriffenheit: der &lt;Versöhnungstod Jesu Christi&gt; ist der poetische Niederschlag einer ausgesprochen pietistischen Uberzeugung; und eben deshalb haben von all dem Passions geschehen nur jene Teile Aufnahme gefunden, die dem Pietisten in seiner anthropomorph gerichteten, religiösen Auffassung, in semer persönlichen Demütigung vor den psychischen und physischen Leiden Christi ganz besonders nahe gehen» (7). 33 The shift was already implicit in the positive reception accorded Klopstock by Pietist read ers. As Heinz Kindermann comments in J.M.R. Lenz und die deutsche Romantik, 5: «Be sonders die pietistischen Kreise haben die bis dahin erschienen Gesänge des &lt;Messias&gt; mit großer Begeisterung aufgenommen. Im Unterbewußtsein mag wohl die damalige Genera tion schon gefühlt haben, daß es sich bei Klopstock und dem Pietismus um eine Grund strömung handle...» An earlier, briefer version of this paper was presented at the International Lenz-Symposium,</page><page sequence="17">Klopstock's Influence on J.M.R.
