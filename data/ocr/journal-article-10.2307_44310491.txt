[Language System and Reality]. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest 1971. In the book Jánoš Zsilka sums up the studies he has been carrying on for a decade and the synthesis he thus achieves yields further results. The important place of these studies in the development of modern linguistics is ensured by two related aspects: it is here that we see, on the one hand, the first critical survey actually going beyond the standpoint of the American and French descriptive schools, the two representative tendencies of modern linguistic structural- ism; on the other, simultaneously with and as a condition of the above, a positive attempt to establish the system of the language, and to determine the real nature of the language system. Seeing the results we can say that the author's work has opened a new way and offers new possibil- ities for the development of linguistics. The subject of the book is the system of sentence patterns; to be more exact, the system of structures containing object cases (accusatives) . The material is supplied by Hungarian, Latin and Greek. Surpris- ingly it was only modern linguistics that first placed the sentence as a total sum of grammatical relations into the centre of its investigations. (Apart from the 17th- century attempt of the Grammaire Géné- rale.) One of the outstanding results of these investigations came with the discov- ery of the sentence pattern. The notion of sentence pattern, which expresses the structural uniformity of sentences differ- ent in their content will, however, undergo a change in Zsilka's conception. Modern grammar, which deals with the rules the speaker applies in order to produce sen- tences, cannot interpret the sentence pat- tern but as the mechanical summation of the isolated rules of traditional grammar, and thus only appears to surpass the iso- lating syntagmatic character of this latter; for Zsilķa the sentence is the complex unity of rules organically presupposing one another. To concentrate on the accusative struc- tures in the investigations of the language system and regard them as a kind of pivot to the system was, beyond being a lucky idea, a judicious step to take. We can say with Adorno that in scientific development it is more promising to concentrate on the particular, to break up its seemingly mon- adological character and discover in the core of the matter the essential, than to urge pluralistic syntheses under the pre- text of integrating the different spheres of knowledge. The fact that the verb occupies a distinguished position in the sentence is a discovery of old standing (see the Gram- maire Générale, and recently Tesnières). It has also been realized that among the verbs the transitive verbs play a distin- guished rôle. The historical significance of transitivity was pointed out by Ben veniste and Bréal, for instance. Now what is partic- ularly remarkable in Zsilka's conception is that in it the objects (accusati ve^) are not of uniform value: we can establish Acta Linguistica Academiae Scientiarum Huvgaricae 23, 1973</page><page sequence="2">402 CRITICA historical-genetical relations between them. No grammar has so far managed to solve the problem of classifying the objects sa- tisfactorily; consequently the classification of transitive verbs was also lacking, and if an attempt was made to produce such a classification, it was done from totally superficial aspects (Delbrück). This natu- rally does not mean that the theory of the object has no preliminaries at all. The book makes use of certain ideas from the last century, too, such as the hypothesis of the primary object, touched upon in Monro's Homeric Grammar. What however in Monro remains an episodic remark will follow in Zsilka's conception from the inner necessities of the language. The investigation of sentence patterns containing object cases is significant, beyond the narrower linguistic interest, from the aspect of the history of con- sciousness. Object is what the activity is directed at. It can be assumed - which assumption is fully justified by the exam- ples of the book - that the relations of the objects indicate and reflect the rela- tionship between man and reality, or respectively the development of this rela- tionship. Marx discovered the secret of this developing relationship in the objec- tive (productive) activity of man, in the course of which man changes not only the "outside nature" but "his own nature" as well. Zsilka's investigations not only dem- onstrate that the various stages in the development of the object (accusative) show the extension of the reality content they reflect, and so presuppose the widen- ing of the scope of human activity; they also prove that the appearance of a new linguistic dimension (indirect object/dative, modality), which serves for expressing a personal element, must have been pre- ceded by a considerable extension of the reflected reality content, i.e. the develop- ment of the objective accusative. This points to the conclusion that the increase in the significance of the subjective sphere is in connection with the appearance of certain objective conditions. Thus, one (pragmatic) aspect of the system of sentence patterns is that it follows the structure of reality of human practice. The structure of patterns and that of the actual facts correspond to each other. It is to meet the demands of this correspondence that language develops into a reality-reflecting system of relative independence and with specific possi- bilities. All this means that language involves a definite content of consciousness, fixes a certain level of the intellectual articula- tion of the world and that it reveals the segments of a determined period of the development of consciousness. In Zsilka's view the words, sentence patterns etc., automatically determine the content of the message, more precisely the extent of its content. From this point of view it is worth-while to read the profound remarks made by Nicolai Hartmann, one of the most significant bourgeois think- ers of the 20th century, about the "intel- lectual content" of the language ( Problem des geistigen Seins , Chap. 20. d.). According to him language is far from being a merely external, conventional means of communication. If it were such, the learning of the language would have no internal effect on the thoughts of the learner. This However is not true. Language shapes the diversity it expresses. "The word, the sentence structure ... all have a particular force of shaping the content." They have a selective influence not only in the message itself, but also in its per- ception. Language proves to be a vehicle of intellectual contents, a rich arsenal of the categories of perception, thought and comprehension. It is very important that besides the cognitive content of the lan- guage Hartmann also draws attention to the evaluating component of the linguistic expression. In the language one finds in an objective, pre-shaped form such eval- uating elements which also have a selec- tive, determining effect on the way of per- ceiving human relationships, situations, requirements, on the internal attitudes and Acta Linguistica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 23, 1973</page><page sequence="3">CRITICA 403 evaluations, and which thus influence man's entire behaviour. When studying the different forms of teleologisms Hartmann discovered the anthropomorphic character of the lan- guage and the rôle played by the linguistic anthropomorphisms in everyday conscious- ness as well as their only too problematic influence on the categorial structure of philosophic cognition. Thus it was from the contrast of the verbal predicate forms that the category -pair of "acting" and "suffering' ' got into Aristotle's category chart, only to determine through centuries all ideas as to the nature of the influence (cf. Teleological Thought, chap, l.a.; chap. 13.C.). In Zsilka's work some good exam- ples showing the anthropomorphic nature of the language are his comments on anthropomorphic transformation and on the use of the Dative. Naturally the "conceptual" content of the language, which is of determining char- acter from the point of view of the mes- sage, has developed historically on the level of a primitive practice. The survival of the corresponding linguistic structures in the language system is due to the fact that the elementary facts of life which these structures and patterns express are repro- duced historically in everyday human prac- tice on the higher levels of social practice as well. I.e. the synchronic reproduction of the historical development of the lin- guistic structure is based on the pragmatic structure of the linguistic structure. The relevance of the individual lin- guistic facts from the point of view of the history of consciousness has beyond doubt been recognized already earlier, moreover, the neo-Humboldtian ethnolinguists see in the whole of the language the expression of such a determined "world concept" which to a large extent determines man's general view of life according to this aspect. Anyhow, Zsilka is the first to try to recon- struct, starting from the given stage of development of the language system , the historical way of development of that system itself and to throw light on the modified functioning of the different phases and results of that development under the conditions of the given stage of develop- ment. Thus, language as a system of pat- terns is for the first time examined here from the aspect of the development of consciousness and different linguistic mate- rial is brought up to prove methodically the justness of the conception according to which language is a system of the anal- ysis and Synthesis, of the differentiation and generalization of the phenomena, sta- bilized in the course of the people's his- torical development (S. L. Rubinstein). Zsilka, who thinks of language as the "practical consciousness" of the people (Marx), surpasses that - practically arbitrary - conception of the language which has held itself since the beginning of the century and which, though recogniz- ing the existence of a system within the language, considers the relation of this system to reality to be a separate problem (pragmatics) and thus restricts that rela- tion to the problem of the application of the given system. Let us now briefly examine the system of the object-case sentence patterns. Within the system each pattern is an entity; in each pattern the specific movements of the system are summed up, viz.: a) the historic-type "organic" movement; b) the implicative movement; c) the logical-type homosyntactic movement. On the homo- syntactic level the differences of the organic system cease to exist - this is the most general level. Any pattern can at the same time be conceived as part of the organic or of the homosyntactic level. The patterns can be derived from one another. By de- riving the patterns from one another we also determine the system of the elements forming the patterns as a system of ele- ments. The system of elements is the most profound and the longest-range system of rules. More light can be thrown upon the nature of the organic system by confronting it with generative grammar. Generative grammar is one-sidedly deductive, while 9 Acta Linguistica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 23, 1973</page><page sequence="4">404 CRITICA in th© organic system it is also clear how those more general patterns develop - lin- guistically - from which the more con- crete patterns (and sentences) can be deduced. The organic system interprets any pattern as a determined line of the organic system and at the same time as a homosyntactic pattern (generative gram- mar, however, moves only in the dimension represented in Zsilka's conception by the homosyntactic plane). In the organic system any pattern as part of the organic system leads toward the general homo- syntactic level and can at the same time be deduced from it. The mechanism of the organic system interprets correctly the relation between the concrete and the general and grasps the dialectics of the language system. In the organic system the syntactic lines and the relationships expressed in them internally presuppose one another. Generative grammar does not go beyond the traditional definition of syntagms, in the organic system, however, the nature of syntagms is revealed by the understanding of the nature of the lines they form. Zsilka succeeds in proving, in contrast to the standpoint of modern descriptive linguistics (and especially of Tesnières) that neither the system of pat- terns, nor the relations between the syn- tactic level and the meaning or the seman- tic level are merely additive; the semantic and syntactic structure of the sentences are internally related. One of the most significant results of the investigations is the fact that they throw light upon certain aspects of the categorial structure - in the philosophic sense - of language and upon their dialec- tic nature. We are referring here not only to the results achieved in elucidating the relation between the concrete and the general, but also the relation of movement and state, of the part and the whole. Another significant result is the distinction between the subjective and objective forms of the language system. The dialectic nature of the organic system is also proved by the fact that it distinguishes between different qualitative levels, while genera- tive grammar renounces it. A question may arise: What are the possibilities offered by the new conception of the language system to other sciences? It seems that e.g. the results of evolution- psychology and of linguistic studies may be harmonized to a greater extent on the basis of Zsilka's investigations: the devel- opment of the activity of speaking can perhaps be better understood on the basis of the relation between the concrete and and the general within the language system. In view of Zsilka's statement according to which "by learning a language, man repeats - reduced to a few short months - the process of the historical development of the language. And the functioning language is generally a reproduction of the historic process of the development of the lan- guage", it would be of particular interest to compare his investigations of the case- system with, say, the linguistic-psychologic studies made by A. N. Gvozdiev on chil- dren concerning the process of learning the grammatical structure of the [Russian] language (cf. P. B. Elkonin: Children's Psychology. Budapest, 1964. pp. 100 - 106). However, relations can also be established - on the basis of the objective system of the language - when interpret- ing the language of poetry. A decisive basic principle of Zsilka's investigations of the language system is the fact that he consequently thinks of language as a socially objective system of rules, in contrast to generative grammar whose investigations are concerned more and more with individual psychology.
