<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE PROBLEM: THE ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE Harvey B. Sarles 0. The occasion. The New York Academy of Sciences has decided to sponsor(in September of 1975) an extensive discussion on the origin of language. One wonders whether this issue, which arises seriously about once every century, will provide any news this time through. Will it be an exercise, a convention of the high priests demarcating the arena of the "problem?" Will it be a disputation; or is there a singular point of view which has been subdivided into corporate areas, all with different titles, all selling the same product, all colluding to limit competition? This is a serious wonderment, not becuause the language ori gin problem is de facto so interesting, but because of what it seems to represent and to entail. While it appears in many senses a straight forward issue, it is, in my experience, an epigram for a view of human nature: Language is that which makes man unique. The view implied by raising the issue of language origin has increasingly been in flux on a number of grounds, for a variety of reasons. One suspects that such a conference at this time is an attempt to stave off change and to restate in a very public way that the human nature "business" is in the same location and peddling the same wares, stylized to fit the tastes of the 1970's. I have tried, in the following paper, to state what is wrong with the "problem" of the origin of language, to offer some alterna tive ways of conceptualizing the underlying issues, and to show why they might be interesting. In my view, the "origin of language" problem is a pseudo-problem. As it is conceptualized and treated, it will not, nor can it, yield any new knowledge about language or about human nature. In the history of ideas, its elaboration already presumes a particular definition of human nature. Discussion of the "origin" of language only defends this definition—and embroiders itwith a network of entailments which follow directly from its assumptions. It is virtually a system of thought about human nature, and consequently it does not leave itself open to attack, or even to discussion. It presumes that language and reason are essentially the same, a unity, in correctly describing the human condition; any attempt to re-orient the problem is considered to be against "reason" and therefore irrational.1 149</page><page sequence="2">150 Sign Language Studies 11 Any set of ideas whose ultimate defense rests upon such grounds seems to me to be very suspect. Nor can I find any grounds on which such a problem is open to the possibility of proof or disproof. It is no more than a particular descriptive system; one which is probably as consistent and accurate as, say, any particular geometry. This is not to say that the pre vailing view about language is uninteresting or non-useful. It is to claim that it is not necessaryily an exhaustive or accurate system. There are different ways to think about language than the issue called "the origin of language" would suggest. What does the notion of language origin presume: Why is it interesting to question the very raising of this issue, particu larly at this time? Logically, the issue presumes a type of human uniqueness which is progressive; we are similar to ani mals only in some respects. In the realm of "language" humans aie ow umci cul aixia ow auvauucu ucyuuu uliicx annua xù aü lu uc non-comparable with them. The issue thus presumes an essential discontinuity between (other) animals and humans. 2 In such a situation, the presumption is that there was a (historical) jump between human predecessors and human beings. The reason for the problem "the origin of language" is simply to account for the differences between humans and non-humans. The logical problem is that there is no way within this con ceptual system to find out what non-humans are like. Non-humans are conceptualized as particular forms of deficient humans; not in their "own terms. " We have decided that they do not possess lan miano' hhû nmKlûm i c +r\ onnT ri nr-o Anrcûltmc V»/~mat a "F ûta? thoco have-nots could have come upon what we consider to be language. Reading the history of this issue, it seems that different theories have appeared reasonable and convincing in different eras (Salus 1969). Since logically, on prior grounds of non-comparability, there is no possibility of a knowledge base for such theories, what appears reasonable or convincing must have to do with issues extrinsic to the so-called problem. Either there is no issue, or there is no possible solution. It thus behooves us to investi gate the presumptions which lie behind this pseudo-problem, and to ask why it appears to be reasonable, even to otherwise reasonable people. Part 1 of what follows will be devoted to unraveling the under lying presumptions. I offer an alternative view about the nature of animals and men. In light of the continuing observations that our ancestors were already social creatures, language did not make</page><page sequence="3">Sarles 151 o us social. I attempt to develop the implications of this dif ferent conceptualization of animal sociality, how it might affect our view of human nature and of language. Along the way I will also point out that some animal behaviorists have taken the prevailing (pseudo) beliefs about human language and have tried to promote their views about human nature, while appear ing to derive these views solely from observations of non-hu mans. Overall, I will attempt to show that we principally use the form of animals and man to tell one species from another. This fact of the existence of bodies has been by-passed and neglected within the prevailing conceptual construction of the problem "the origin of language. 1. Individuals and minds. The .primary urge which has pushed the development of our views of human nature has been theo logical, metaphysical, and political. ^ What is the nature of human life; especially of death? This construction of the prob lem of human life postulates that the "soul" or "mind" of man is the uniquely essential aspect of human nature. It not only differentiates us from (other) animals but endures also beyond the "life" of the body. With just one more assumptive piece, this accounting of the problem of human nature seems to have predetermined almost all of our thinking about huçnans, about language, about other animals, and so on. The remaining as sumption is that the primary locus of being of both sould and mind is the individual human being. This is sufficient to ac count for the language origin problem. An alteration in any one of these pieces will change the way in which we conceptualize human or (other) animal nature. ^ It follows quite easily and directly from the notion that human beings are unique because of our souls and minds that we alone possess other unique facets of our being. For any number of reasons, but mostly on theological grounds, the perfectly obvious idea that our bodies are also distinctly human has been rejected as a focal area for accounting for 7 human nature. How are souls and minds of human beings unique ? In several ways; and it is important to note that the ancient so lutions to these questions still seem appealing and common sensical. Once this question seems reasonable, its potential solutions follow. If no man has a soul which endures forever, then the conceptualization of human nature already has taken on a particular viewpoint of the nature of time "must be" made an</page><page sequence="4">152 Sign Language Studies 11 attribute of being rather than, say, a relationship among persons and the external world. If the soul is forever, tempting is the thought that any particular moment is a mere step on the stair way to heaven.® If we view any moment from the perspect of forever-after, it is likely to appear infinitesimally small. It is one more small step to think of it as illusory, because an entire life is but a moment in the greater expanse of time. Who is to know but that all we observe is a shadow of some deeper reality? God only knows. It also follows from this concept of soul and time that animals, not having souls, also do not have time. How else can we account for claims that (other) animals exist only in the "here and now?"® The other element in this thinking is that minds are what give us the time sense; thus it must be that bodies do not possess such abilities. Bodies only exist in the "here and now;" sensation is in the body; we have bodies essentially like those of other animals. Bodies are natural, biological; the mind is what is unique to man. The want to find out what is really natural about human beings, we must observe other animals. ^ These ideas follow easily from the notion of time, which the postulation of human uniqueness and "soul" seems to force upon us. In a complicated way, most of the elaborations of human nature have also derived from this postulate. If we believe that animals live only in the moment, we believe that we do not. This then sets up a difference, an opposition, be tween mind and body, between "concrete" and "abstract", between "subject" and "object", and leads to a theory of knowledge in which the most important aspects of human nature are precisely those features by which we presume ourselves to differ from (other) animals. It is not at all necessary to know anything about other animals—we have been able to in vent their capabilities fully without the necessity of consul ting "them." Almost all our methodologies for studying other animals' "language" already presume that which they set out to discover. Later I attempt to show how our methodologies for investigating their communication systems have been set up in such a way that our theories about them cannot possibly be refuted. (1975)</page><page sequence="5">Sarles 153 The roadway connecting language with mind is also quite direct, following from the primary locus of being in the individ ual and from uniqueness: What is the mind? What is in the mind? Obviously bits of being which make us unique: ideas, thought, memories, i.e. time and all it implies. Non-body. We are the only animals who have language. That seems clear enough, al though I suspect it was derived from assumptions not from obser vation. It simply is not difficult to note that many animals make complicated noises. Why do we assume and believe they do not have language? Not from any evidence, but because we believe that we alone have language, ideas, thoughts. And this is what makes us unique. Each step of the journey appears logical, but it is nontheless circular. The individual contains the ideas or thought which language represents. The mind or soul is that which is the essence of men, but, especially, of each individual man. One suspects, as Nietzsche points out (1967), that Plato was attempting to make time stop, in order to ward off the fear of impending per sonal, bodily death, and to ensure (a theory of) immortality.^ Thus the notion of human nature as located in each individual was motivated not by a consideration or understanding of life as living processes but by the attempt to manage and conquer the fear of death. This view has led to a virtual impasse in the development of theories of mind, and so of human nature. (1973a). ^ In the history of ideas, the notion of (other) animals' under standing the world and one another seems not to have arisen seriously until relatively recently. Bestiality implied a sense ot non-rationality, intemperance, and a lacK ot seit-controi, forethought, and controlled impulses. No wonder that the pre sumed road from non-human to human nature is strewn with so-called "primitives", who are assigned increasing doses of rationality yet retain certain "deficits. " In "origin of language" theory it is simply not possible for animals to communicate deeply; the theory implies a notion of the (other) animal world which makes only human beings capable of understanding the universe and one another. Language and the "gaining" of language enabled us to understand the objec tive or external world and one another. The ontogeny of the in dividual recapitulates the development of the human species. From non-language to language, understanding, rationality, communication. Language enables communication, society, cul ture. Human beings develop consciousness through understan ding others and how others understand them; consciousness of the "I" enables the "thou."^</page><page sequence="6">154 Sign Language Studies 11 In broad outline, this is how the origin of language problem has been and continues to be conceptualized. Its "soulution" should show how non-thinking beasts could have begun to be rational, logical, and conscious of self. It seems that certain stories which gradually extend what we believe to be "animal" or bodily abilities have been and continue to be the most plausible. Physical or emotional ges tures seem like reasonably intermediary steps from animal to human nature. Before we engage in offering such "solutions" however, we must require that we know, in some deep sense accurately, about tne Denavior ot otner animals, we ao not possess such knowledge. I do not believe that we can obtain this knowledge, because this conceptualization of the language origin problem strongly suggests a particular view of other animals which is based on their not being human—which has meant their not having language. It remains unclear what goes on in (other) animals' "minds. " What is clear is that our conceptualization of human nature and language forces us to believe a particular story about animals which is derived not from animals themselves but from our own uniqueness theories about human beings. 2. Objections to the "problem. " My objections to the problem are of several sorts: a. Our predecessors were already social. What we call lan guage is a (possibly) new form of communication, but it is not necessarily that which makes us unique. (1969, 1974a, 1974b) b. Current formulation of the problem blocks the possibility of learning much new about human beingness. It presents a view of language which focuses on "differences" and obscures possibly valid comparisons. It is my experience that compara tive work must proceed from similarities, not from differences or it will tend only to confirm, describe, and account for the observed or presumed differences. (It can only confirm, or en large, human/non-human differences; it cannot possibly cast new light on the human condition.) One wonders why peo ple engage in this supposedly comparative problem, when they already presume strong human uniqueness. (1972, 1975)^ c. The problem calls attention away from a series of poten tially interesting ways of thinking about human nature; e.g. the notion that human beings intstantiate others as faces. (1972, 1973, 1974a)</page><page sequence="7">Sarles 155 d. It makes Man appear to have stopped evolving when he "got" language and urges a static view of the human experience. e. It enables the ideas of the view of mankind which seem plausible at any historical moment to appear as exhaustively true. (1975) f. By setting Man up as unique because of his mind, this view of the problem idealizes the normal use of language and sets up a group of defective (or animal-like) human beings; e.g. retarded persons, deaf persons, persons who speak dif ferently from the majority. The problem is implicitly, perhaps necessarily, racist. (1972ms, 1974d) g. By setting up human creatures as more complex than ani mals, it has oversimplified most animals. It has also tended to permit us to oversimplify our species, since we were by it unique only because we had language. It has been tempting for what, in my life at least, is a very complicated and ever changing being-and-experiencing. h. The mere announcement of the problem suggests that we already know, in some deep sense, what language is. Thus it obfuscates the fact that our theories about human language remain relatively simple and minimal. Language, the "target" of the process by which animal becomes man, tends also to be static, an entity rither than the behavioral, muscular pro cesses which language undoubtedly includes. (1974e) The exciting thing about comparing animals and man is that we J.11UJT yuiu UCVV VVU/ Ö LiXJ.liJS.JLliy UUUUL UXU-Ii, lULllCl LliUlI JJClliy forever locked into our ancient humanly derived ideas about ourselves. (1972) i. It blames "the victims "--animals are made not merely dif ferent but also "defective" human beings. (1971ms) j. By making human beings appear to be especially unique, it forces us to lump all (other) species into a single, non-lan guage-possessing universe. It is more likely that there are greater differences in the animal universe than the speaking propensities of human animals would suggest, k. It implies or includes a theological and political view of man which is claimed to be wholly intellectual. Particular theologies and particular politics are borne on the wings of its proclaimed scientism. (Any position about human nature which claims a purely scientific base is either very naive or its proponents are attempting to wrap their prior views in new cloth—perhaps both. ) (1975a)</page><page sequence="8">156 Sign Language Studies 11 1. It calls attention to the individual in ways which obscure the social aspects of human existence or make them seem to detract from the possibilities of individual freedom. (1973) On the contrary, 3. Language is a social process. The major notion derived from ethology which has impressed me (with respect to the language issue and its emergence at this time) is that it now appears clear that pre-humans were already social creatures. We did not become social on becoming human and through the use of language—human beings were always social, are always social,. .. What this implies for language origin is very deep and far-reaching, because our origin theories rest in large meas ure on a story which makes language the primary functor or en abler in human society and culture (Cassirer 1955). Many ethologists still entertain this vision: In the view of Lorenz, language is a quality which virtually removes man from nature— "The greatest gifts of man, the unique faculties of conceptual thought and verbal speech which have raised him to a level high above all other creatures" (On Aggression, p. 230). Lorenz sees the unique features of man as so great that man is not directly comparable to other creatures. To even find out anout man's "natural, moiogicai, instinctual" state one must and can only infer from other creatures to man, because lan guage obfuscates man's inner, deep, true nature. Those par ticular features of man (e.g. aggression, morality, territori ality) for which Lorenz and other scholars claim primacy guide the research and interpretation of their work and their scholarly traditions. One must be wary of the so-called biologist who has man as more unique than other species because of a certain attribute such as language, because he can use this story to characterize human nature pretty much as he wants to--yet it remains inobvious that many aspects of man's animal nature remain unnoticed, unnoted. We must be wary, because the non observers among us tend to trust the observations of a brilliant biologist like Lorenz. We are less aware that his story which claims to be biological is so similar to the theo-political meta phors which have guided traditional thought that his behavioral biology may simply be a new form of the same old story (cf Waddington 1975). Thus many ethologists-behavioral biologists continue to believe man to be an especially peculiar form of demi-animal, because of his "possession" of language and all that language</page><page sequence="9">Sarles 157 has entailed in the history of Western thought about language. But it seems clear to me that man—as are all species by definition if the biology of "species" has any real meaning—is unique. In attempting to understand the problem of the origin of our species we must wonder what it might mean to be already social and to have eveolved as social creatures. The question of language origin assums that language came first, then enabled communi cation, understanding,... then society. Being social seems to imply that creatures engaging in social processes already possess some sense of knowledge of one another, of who is and who is not a "member", or of who can be or might be a member, etc. Sociality involves com munication, understanding, politics, law, morality. It implies a sense of being, a way of being, with respect to others, a member of one's significant grouping."''® As one begins to think through some of the implications of sociality, a number of questions arise about what human language might "mean". If all social creatures have some sort of knowing (an "epistemology"), then human language may simply represent another form of knowing--one among many. All species "know" their universe; survival means, to me, senses of knowing. How can non-languaging creatures communicate? What might they communicate about? What does the notion of communication ultimately mean? Is language used to communi cate? If we are (also) social creatures, then could we have communicated before we had/could language? What is language anyway? Expressing the problem this way might lead one in a number of different directions: a. If communication in human beings exists "pre-language" (e.g. between mothers and infarcts), what are the forms and nature of such communication? b. How does language develop and change and/or enrich the nature of communication ? c. How do deaf people understand one another (and the world) ? d. What is animal "noise" about? Is it speech as opposed to human language (in a sign/symbol dialectic sense)? 18 Are its form and nature that different from language; or have our ideas about animal noise ("calls") been guided by our assumptions about human uniqueness, leading us to believe that (other) ani mals are so un-rich, stupid, non-abstract, un-thinking crea tures? (If the latter, then most of the current work in animal communication "calls" must be anthropomorphic. ) 19</page><page sequence="10">158 Sign Language Studies 11 e. What do other animals hear and "think"? Does this have anything to do with their "limited" mental capacities? Is it any less anthropomorphic to say that other animals "think" than to say that they don't "think" ? f. If animal being and animal communication have something to do with animal form, do human being and communication have much to do with human bodily form?20 g. What is the human body as a communicative instrument; e.g. how do infants "understand" their mothers'(bodies) ? h. How do adult bodies influence their communication, being, understanding ? i. How do people get to look like they do? j. What is the nature of "gesture" ? k. And what the'innateness"of communication?. . . In thinking about the nature of sociality with reference to human and other animals, several features become apparent. (1972ms, 1973a, 1974a) We are not merely "minds and bodies" in an individual sense; we are "socially expressive" creatures whose presence and movements are available to, and actually noted and monitored by, others. "Even" in the human condition, most of our behavior is nonverbal and is constantly "read" by other people. Social adults have in mind the product they desire in their children, a model of future being delimited by the way they see their young. If the concept of misbehaving is avail able to social animals (and sociality implies such behavioral limits), then each animal who punishes must enjoy a sense of being which is well defined. Social adults do not merely see and interact with larger or smaller bodies; they have some notion of other beings as proper or improper. This notion of human beings as already social and communi cating beings points toward redefinitions and reconceptuali zations of language. Our ancient, yet current, ideas about language and linguistics are clearly asocial, probably anti social, in their entailments. Definitions of language (all of which must be reconsidered in light of human-as-social-crea tures) include the very idea of grammar as the set of all(pos sible)sentences and of the words which compose them. But grammar has never led to the study of the body or of communi cation. 21 In the real-social world, the sounds which emerge from our mouths and faces are merely a form of communication; they do not enable it to occur. Language (now emphasized because</page><page sequence="11">Sarles 159 its very existence is open to question) enables the forms of communication to expand and change. It helps us to manipu late space and time, gives a sense of permanance to one's being and to the world of others and of objects, and makes sensible one's existence in others' terms.22 I question, however, whether language enables us to be conscious, human, rational, intentional, logical, creative, or any of the other mind-related terms which the exclusive definitions of language as distinctly human have forced us to believe. In Western thought, language and reason are coterminous and tautological. They can tell us nothing new about human being ness J In the real-social world, individuals emerge; they do not pre-exist, bounded by their souls or by their skins. Current grammars imply that each individual is the (sole) repository of the rules for generating all possible sentences. Though in many senses a truth, this implication is a limited and mis leading one. It makes, for example, the existence of human bodies become essentially inconsequential to human being. Current language theories are seductive. By making human uniaueness aoDear to be most clearlv due to the uniaueness of the human mind, they lead us away from the fact that the human form is quite special. Consequently we have been led to study facial expression as if it represents merely the exter nal workings-out of one's inner being, rather than having a complex nature which may in some senses be causal and not nancoH fl Q79mc 1 Perhaps the first move in understanding the nature of language as part(s) of a social interactional process is to postulate a different form of grammar, a grammar not of sen tences merely but of guestions and responses. (1970) In sentence grammar (i.e. "mind grammar") questions are only another form of sentence. In the real-social world of inter action, questions get answered! I suggest that the Human Grammar, at least of early child development, is composed of parents playing a game of ques tion and response with children about their relationships and the external world. They use the existing communicative body relationship and extend it to the external universe (Wittengen stein 1958). It is interesting to notice that certain aspects of the lan guaging process have been almost totally overlooked—just simply</page><page sequence="12">160 Sign Language Studies 11 missed or dismissed—because of our preconceptions about language as words and sentences, surface representations of a deeper mind. These "surface" representations have a lot to do with what an infant is about. Consider: The infant watches very carefully the mouth and other facial movements of its parents. We have missed the fact that languaging is itself a set of facial expressions. "Baa, baa, black sheep" is explos ively, contrastively facial, especially as we say it to an infant. It is engagement (practice in moth moving and shaping) not merely words. How has it been missed in our descriptions of language ? In the quest for the origin of human language it may well be that what is most important is not the mere size or complex itv of the brain or the nresenne of suitable tvnes of vocal cords. but the fact of having human faces with facial muscles. Why has this obvious fact of human existence been omitted from our theories about being? Consider the human propensity to personal ize, e.g. to remember, people essentially as their faces. (One can only speculate about which bodily aspect dogs would choose to preserve in a "Doggie Hall of Fame! ")24 As in any enterprise, one must be clear about what he thinks is important or primary about the nature of his subject matter. I am confident that the Origin of Language problem would look quite different than it seems today25 if the (apparent) fact that human beings do most of their thinking about other human beings in very complicated, dynamic terms of their facial expression were to be elevated to a central notion of human be havioral theories (and why not?). Linguistic descriptions of phonetic articulations discuss the how and where of sound formation but neglect to point out clearly that languaging is like other muscular movements. Talk is a muscular process, not to be relegated to "pre-linguistics" but to be seen as how human beings are. The body "feels good" to move and exercise, and talk is a form of exercise (particular ly satisfying to the lecturer one would guess, the lecturer as marathon runner. (1974a) Our mind-theories of language have been so attractive that the fact that human bodies like their speech "straight-on", full face, has never entered into acoustical theory. Somehow we have been deceived into believing that sound strikes only ears and so auditory nerves, and that the shape of the human face is inconsequential to the shape of the message it hears, and feels.</page><page sequence="13">Sarles 161 Human beings also tend to get their speech "full body front"; many other animals' hearing appratus are located essentially "in front of" their bodies. The very form of our faces, as we come to "look like" we do, may have a lot to do with the sound we hear or like to hear. Bodies are absorptive and reflective and shaping surfaces, as well as male or pretty or non-animaloid. The single largest tissue change in the human body in the first few days after birth takes place in the saliva glands. How is it that our descriptions of human language seem to overlook this fact, that muscular control of saliva is crucial, if not de fining, of human talking and possibly human mentation? Both our talk and our listening occur only via a layer of saliva. Dry ness and languaging are not compatible.^6 The (mere) fact that these processes work so well for most of us, that they go unnoticed, unresearched, and un-thought about, does not mean that they are unimportant. The muscular device called the human tongue is quite meticulous in touching to talk, and also in spreading saliva. (Language as a sub-topic in the study of saliva ? Better that the origin of language pro blem focussed here!) The tongue "knows" its domain so well that only changes in the domain will remind us that the tongue is the major shaper of the mouth and face; the tongue is con stantly tensioned. It is visually available to infants to see to feel and to explore their own tongue. The "oral" stage of de velopment may not only be "mental" as well but also the major mode of exploration of the world for the first years of life; i.e. most of one's external contacts take place through the mouth. What are other animals' tongues doing while they wander in the forest primeval? What about their saliva? No one seems to know much about tongues or saliva, beyond a first, super ficial attempt to characterize the proteins which may be found in the average bit of spit. The "origin" of language may have principally to do with human tongues, and saliva. The major point of this section is that all of this occurs not merely in one's mouth or mind or body, but also in the presence of other creatures in whom we show interest. Human babies spend a great deal of time and energy watching others' faces—not simply in "psyching" others' minds but in study ing others' faces. How is it that they sense that their "face" is "like" their mother's? If we want to understand the origin and development of language, is it not sensible to study its original students, our infants?</page><page sequence="14">162 Sign Language Studies 11 4. Knowing as a social process. Granted, that children are in volved with others' faces and bodies; how is it that they get to know about "the external world"? How do they come to know objects, to name concepts, to become the sorts of conscious, abstracting, creative, reasoning creatures that we like to think of as uniquely humanoid? Are they? In order to probe this issue more deeply, we have to con sider what we imagine language to be and again to point out that heretofore its characterizations have been partial and particular. They follow from and justify the beliefs about human uniqueness for which they were constructed. Language, for example, appears to be infinite in sentence grammar, "because" we are creative and can expand our ideas way beyond our ex perience. For Thomas Aquinas, we are creative because God is infinite (Pegis 1948), and other animals without souls can not be creative. It seems to me that this one aspect of lan guage has been raised to primacy because it assisted in the human uniqueness, the having-a-soul, argument and not be cause it was clearly correct. How can we possibly know whether other animals are creative, abstract whatever? Almost all of our methods for studying them have precluded this very possibility—with the exception of the Gardners' and some other current work with chimpanzees (Gardner 1971). The arguments about human language have implicitly (occasionally explicitly) carried with them a description of how animals think--rather do not think. I suggest that such arguments derive not from animals but directly from human characterizations of animals as sub-human. The idea that animals have "calls" which are more or less instinctual is not necessarily to characterize animals in their own terms but to set off human animals as especially special. "Callists" are auiltv of this sort of anthronomorohic reasoning, which they often accuse others of employing. That they can turn around and use descriptions based on a view of animals as defective human beings to characterize human beings is un derstandable only if we believe that they came to the study of animals already having axes to grind about human behavior. About the appearance of language as infinite,^® I suggest that infants already relating and communicating with parents begin somehow to be in a question-response relation with them. (1970) Given several dozen "question words", each yielding a distinct "response set", language would indeed</page><page sequence="15">Sarles 163 appear to be infinite. The set of all answers to the single question "Where?" is itself infinite. It generates as many answers (sentences) as there are "places" in the imaginable universe. If anything, there are quite a few infinitudes in language, but that fact does not make language any more mysterious or mystical or special than the facts of the exis tence of anything else (nor any less). The primacy of the assumption of language-as-infinite has given a particular twist to the "great" problems in Western thought. However, it has not yielded, and cannot possibly yield, any solutions. It has provided very little if any insight into the human condition beyond what it already presumes. In this sense language is merely a powerful metaphor which en capsulates a particular view of human nature. Its "analysis" will not tell us more than the metaphor already contains. Why is anything sensible? This problem sentence grammar (S-grammar) cannot handle; it can only impute making sense to each (normal) human individual as innate or its propensity innate. In a social-interactional view, sensibility is a state ment about what society (e.g. a mother treating her infant as a representative of how a "normal" human person constructs the universe) means sensibility to be. Sensibility subsumes "logic" or "rationality," because it shifts these notions to the way in which one's society thinks, and because it is a notion which permits change. Rationality is not then uniquely human, but it is a statement about how one's significant others think about the world. The adult members of each community tend (within some limits) literally to see the world in approximately the same ways. The idea of a language as a set of words referring to objects already extant implies that speakers of any language see ob jects in essentially the same way. Their minds might in some concoc Ho unrw Hifforont Knf tKo aloi Utir -t-o «"«all "taKlo 11 onn sistently by that term implies sameness of its properties and agreement on what it looks like. In this sense of language there is essentially no arbitrariness or disagreement about what is seen in a visually "busy" universe. In effect, each infant who will come to be called "normal" must come to see and to say in the same way as do the adults whom he will join. Sensibility is not some organismic propensity but a statement about sociality: Each child will come to see the world and understand it in about the same way as others; any failure to do so will result in exclusion from society, or the label defective, retarded, autistic, etc.^</page><page sequence="16">164 Sign Language Studies 11 Whether any non-normal person is not willing to become sensible or is not able to become sensible is one of the points on which S-grammar and an interactional, question-response (Q-R) grammar will disagree. If one's view of language im putes sensibility and knowing to the individual, then becoming sensible is strictly the problem of the abnormal person. He was "born defective", with poor genes, "tired eggs", his mother got frightened by a goblin—the victim is blamed for his inca pacity. On the other hand, even a physically unusual individual (and each of is anomalous in some sense or other as I learned in anatomy) can become a pretty normal sort of person. It has seemed to me that becoming and staying normal is «a jJiuocoû VVIIX^U J.Ö paiL Llit: buuiai ûUfcîIlU . IL wuuiu De Uli — ficult to know in a definite way whether abortion, autism, retardation... are organismic or interactional, and whether their therapies ought to be directed to the individual qua-in dividual or to the individual in terms of some social reality (or to both). But our theories direct us to one or the other direction almost exclusively. If sensibility, rationality, and normality are essential properties of the individual, then a lact of them or peculiar sorts of them are the "fault" of the individual. In this view, it becomes clear that the outside world and other persons in one's world are nothing more than stimuli which nurture one's being. But there are no other "minds". Time tends to be fixed; once is forever. An abnormal life is the payoff for a "genetic accident. " Instead, I propose that life-as-interaction is a very fragile, procès suai mode of being. We ought to be "surprised" at how well it usually works. If an infant "looks funny" (as say in Down's Syndrome), parents are highly likely, in my observa tion, to spend less time and energy interacting with that child. As I have suggested elsewhere (1972ms), it is impos sible to know whether a child has a defective or retarded mind, or whether his treatment and subsequent "internal" view are very different from what most of us call normal. (As someone who grew up as a partially handicapped person, I can give ample testimony that being physically "unusual" is a small feature of being, which tends at all moments to grow and pervade one's total existence.)</page><page sequence="17">Sarles 165 S-grammar (or mind-grammar) leads us to postulate normality as an inherent/innate attribute of individuals; Q-R grammar sug gests that so-called normality (including intelligence, rational ity and other traits we have believed to be uniquely human) is a statement about a very complicated and fragile interactional process. Which theory is chosen makes a great deal of dif ference in how the behavioral scientist will regard the world to be observed. The same choice in ways of thinking about lan guage has very clear and definite implications for how all of us regard all people who "look different" or think differently from the majority. S-grammar, in my view, inevitably lends itself to a form of racism, because it imputes those distinctly humanoid qualities of intelligence and reason to each (perfect) organism rather than to the form and quality of social processes. In my view, S-grammar is a theological notion, which may now be retired in the context of human beings as intrinisically social, evolving, as we have, from other social beings.^0 So also in my view, are individuality, self, personhood emergent processes, growing over time. 5. Toward an existential biology. Where, then, are we in considering the "origin of language"? The issue of the "origin" of a putative entity called "lan guage" seems to have two senses: (1) a temporal, simple, causal sense; and (2) a much broader, conceptual sense. Was there a singular event, such as the enlargement of the human brain, which enabled us to have language? Or was there a com plicated nexus of processes, which gradually changed the nature of human nature—language being but one of the resultant features of being? The "origin" problem tend to suggest the former, a singular clear course, akin, say, to the origin of a glacier. Attention to the dynamics of languaging, however, to its devel ompent and the dimensions of the interacting bodies, suggests that language is one small part of a set of gradually accretive processes toward being human. There may have been many points of "origin". It is in this latter sense that the isolation ui ûuiiic ciiLity uiiat vvc uqu lanyuayc 10 iiiiüicauiny . uui z,eai to "account" for human nature has tempted us to capture ari essence and believe that it is exhaustively the essence of man. On the contrary, the view of man as unique because of language seems to have exhausted its power of accounting and explaining. These theories of language have no place to go that they have not already been.</page><page sequence="18">166 Sign Language Studies 11 The dilemmas of life, in terms of our social being, have to do with the nature of our sociality. If we are always and al ready communicating creatures, the development of body, lan guaging, thought, and self are variations on the nature of such processes. It is not that our minds "take over" from our bodies; it is that we grow and develop as unitary sorts of beings. There is no question that the processes of communication change and develop through life. It is the nature of these pro cesses, the form and changes in them, which ought to be the subject matter worth probing—not a limited aspect of our devel opment called "language". The lilemma of life, as encapsulated by the "origin" prob lem, is that it seems to tell us that only the "mind" parts of our being represent the true person. Our bodies are either in consequential to our being or less important in our lives. The nrnhlom T coo it î c Vioiat tn ropnnpîlo ^ tVioorw of hoinrr human with our life experience. In effect, what we need to do is to admit our conceptual beings "back into our bodies. " We exist as biological beings and will continue to. But our mind theories of being seem to have denied this. The antidote has been to deny the "mind" and talk only about "behavior", but this has not jibed with our existence either. We are not one or another, mind or body, but "all of these". We are, in my view, much more complicated creatures than our theories have been leading us to admit, or to realize. In order to gain the sorts of insights and knowledge about being human which the "origin of language" problem has not permitted, observations about us and (other) animals must remain "open". It is not possible to compare with ourselves creatures whom we have already decided are different in essential features of their being. Yet, to further our own ob jectivity about ourselves, it is necessary to observe other species and attempt to understand their "terms", their space, their bodies. If the "sound" one hears differs ac cording to one's sort of body, then an instrumental compari son of sound is pseudc-comparison. We need first to under stand the relation of sound and body form. Current ideas seem to presume that a particular analysis of human sounds grants insight into other species' significant sounds. This sort of thinking is not true comparison but points to and highlights differences instead of similarities. All of us believe that we are different from (other) animals; the question that remains is: How are we different?</page><page sequence="19">Sarles 167 As Allen Gardner and I concluded together in a debate on this issue a few years ago with Peter Marler and Norman Geschwind, the discontinuity between (other) animals and human beings has not been in language or thought but in the conceptualizations we have brought to the problem. The origin of language problem remains a pseudo problem. I have tried to clarify why this is so, and to suggest other ways of considering the issues involved. In my view, we are on the threshold of a fascinating era of discoveries about the nature of human nature, which an open comparative science may yield. What has, in effect, stopped us has been a firm belief in the uniqueness of man as the only creature with language. How could we know that? NOTES 1. This statement is taken from several years of personal ex perience in defending my position concerning the possible com parison between human and non-human verbal utterances. The response, particularly from academic philosophers and linguists, is that they are a priori non-comparable, as different as one can imagine. I merely ask, perhaps too insistently, how they knew that, how could they possibly know that? Having been a field linguist, having done a fair amount of homework, having lis tened to animal behaviorists discussing their work on animals, I have been suspicious that the certitude about human languages' uniqueness rests on grounds not intellectual but part of popular views about the human condition. Who is so uncertain about human uniqueness that he must rule out such comparative efforts as doomed to failure? (1969) Who must defend the sanctity of human language by accusing its questioners of being non-serious or simply irrational? 2. The use of parentheses surrounding other before animals is to remind us, throughout the paper, that the status of man-as-animal is what must remain open to question and debate. From a modern biologist's viewpoint all species are unique, by definition. But who can say that man is more unique or extra-natural than any other species? Why, by "language"? (Simpson 1970). Attempts to specify degrees of uniqueness are beset with definitional and perspectival arguments. What I am attempting to do is to remind</page><page sequence="20">168 Sign Language Studies 11 us that human beings are unique but that we cannot discover the areas of uniqueness by defending a particular historical view about the species. The methods for becoming more ob jective about our behavior must remain broadly comparative and open. The "origin of language" problem is neither open nor comparative, as will be shown in the rest of this paper. 3. Ernst Cassirer spells out the history of this issue with great care, pointing out that a great number of issues reflect themselves in the context of being human and having language (1955). In general, it has been assumed that man was both non-languaging and non-social prior to has "possessing" lan guage. It was language which he obtained first: This in turn enabled man to communicate with and to understand others of his own kind. In this sense, the history of the "origin of language" problem is the attempt to account for how non-lan guaging, non-social creatures might have "discovered" language. The view that human creatures were likely to have evolved as already social creatures suggests that "language" is quite pos sibly a very different thing than what we have believed it to be. Much of my own work has been an attempt to point out some of the aspects of human languaging which have been overlooked within the current construction of the nature of language. 4. Beginning most clearly with Spinoza, in the gradual develop ment of existential, as opposed to essentialist, thought, the human body has indeed "reappeared" as an aspect of human nature, despite Plato's once successful attempts to suppress or "hide" it. My position is that social beings are in constant contact with the forms, particularly the faces, of others. The very formulation of one's being (how one "looks") depends on how significant others imagine one looks and treat one within that particular dynamic vision. I have attempted to extend G.H. Mead's (1934) ideas to include the presence of what Mead took to be an arena of symbolic interaction. (1972ms, 1973a, 1974a) [ Dates in parentheses and separated from the sentences, here in the notes and in the text, refer to papers by the author listed in the References which follow the notes.]</page><page sequence="21">Sarles 169 5. Again it was Plato who set the issues in the form in which they presently appear common-sensically to us. The mental uniqueness of man is constructed in the Phaedo: "In this present life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible intercourse or communion with the body, and are not surfeited with the bodily nature, but keep ourselves pure until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us" (112). The underlying politics are portrayed in the Republic, where the famous philosopher-kings idea is drawn out (431). The argument is developed by an extensive definition of what ought to be: "Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natives who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are com pelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils, --no, nor the human race as I believe,—and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day" (431). The reason "language" plays a prominent part in politics is that language is what has been assumed to make man "rational. " In Plato's view, the philosopher is man at his most rational. And man must be rational to know, understand, and follow rules, a sine qua non for the governance of a proper Republic. One's body and feelings can only muck up a clear, cool mind. Perhaps what we are really discussing is:Whose views of human nature should we believe? on what grounds? 6. The history of ideas, given these assumptions, is a develop ment of what happened. As particular problems arose, certain solutions were considered to be inadequate, others were proposed, became common-sensical, and so on. The sociology of knowledge in this arena has to do with the tension and dialectic between prevailing opinion, new solutions to old problems, who agreed or disagreed with whom, and why particular solutions no longer (in any era) "sold" in the intellectual or public opinion market place. In fact, this polemic arises presently because there is now a great deal of flux in the ideas of those (all of us) concerned with human nature; quite possibly there is more uneasiness at present about the human condition than in any other period. 7. "And when real philosophers consider all these things, will they not be led to make a reflection which they will express in words something like the following? 'Have we not found,' they will say, 'a path of thought which seems to bring us and our</page><page sequence="22">170 Sign Language Studies 11 argument to the conclusion, that which we are in the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the body, our desire will not be staisfied, and our desire is of the truth? For the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere re quirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and end less foolery, and, in fact, as men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all. Whence come wars, and fightings, and factions: Whence but from the body and the lusts of the body?... The body is always breaking in upon us, causing turmoil and con fusion in our enquires, and so amazing us that we are prevented from seeing the truth" (Phaedo 12Of). In the Cartesian form of this argument: "Thought is an attribute that belongs to me, it alone is inseparable from my nature" (Meditations 26). Descartes claimed that our bodies are like the bodies of (other) animals; he set up the possibility, reified currently by Chomsky (1966) of "language" as the locus or entry into the essential, unique as pect of human nature, the human mind. 8. Whitehead (1929) has attempted to make time an ongoing process rather than a mere attribute of being. I agree with his position on the nature of being-as-process. However, he does not deal with the sociality of man and its implications, as his is "A Philosophy of the Organism." 9. "Phonetic animal expressions convey, almost without exception, subjective situations and aspirations. They are affective sounds which seldom tend to become objective designations or denomin ations. They express the idea of immediate time only, of a present situation or one which will occur in the immediate future. They cannot express abstract ideas which are unconnected with organic behaviour" (Busnel 1963: 69). These statements do not neces sarily have anything to do with (other) animals. They merely follow from the uniqueness assumptions about human nature. The (other) animals and (human) bodies are assigned the "leftovers" in a mere embellishment of Aristotle: "The animals other than man live by appearances and memories, and have but little of con nected experience; but the human race lives also by art and reasonings" (Metaphysics 980b, 25). 10.

If human reason-language raises us to a point where we are extra-natural in some sense, then an area of enquiry appears, in which the fundamental or "real" nature of man seems open to dis pute. As I point out below, Lorenz and others have entered this apparent arena of study with strong cliams of knowing the true and underlying nature of man. The argument is forceful, but is accompanied and/or motivated by an ideology which, one sus pects, is theo-political and not purely scientific (Lorenz 1966). 11. "For the body which is moved from without is soulless; but that which is moved from within has a soul, for such is the nature of the soul. But if this be true, must not the soul be self-moving, and therefore of necessity unbegotten and immortal? (Phaedrus 286; see also Phaedo, especially the introductory comments on the philosopher's proper concerns with death). Is the "origin of language" problem a theory of life? 12. If Descartes' cogito ergo sum is considered carefully, it claims that each individual exists via thinking and language. But the problem of possibly understanding others remains a di lemma in this construction of the "problem. " In the tradition of Plato-Descartes, the "problem of communication" does not even arise, and language has a purely autonomous existence. (Chomsky 1968). For others (e.g. Cassirer), language enables communication, but how it does so remains unclear and will continue unclear, in my view. Scholars engaged in the "origin of language" problem represent both of these views, and they talk "past" one another, because their underlying assumptions about the nature of language and consequently of man are dif ferent with respect to the nature and the locus of "mind". 13. While the notion of (human) consciousness seems intu itively correct, and self-evident, claims that (other) animals do not possess it, or are not conscious or self-conscious, might direct one to rethink its sources. Just as language as the nature of consciousness is arguable, even though psychol ogy claims to be studying IT (Miller 1962), so it may be a useful exercise to consider consciousness as: "The ability and willingness of an individual to cue-in on a shared, multi-person picture of the world when it is situationally appropriate" Sarles 1973: 37).</page><page sequence="24">172 Sign Language Studies 11 14. My objections include a number of ideas which are developed in this paper; however, some of them have been argued only in other papers and will be left as simple statements here. Reference is made to other papers where each issue has been considered. 15. For a journalist's review of the 1962 debate at the Animal Behavior Society's symposium, see E. Linden, Apes, Men, and Language (1976; 240ff). 16. There will always remain, I suppose, a question of whether non-human animals have any socially meaningful idea of what "significant" might mean; but, as we will see, most people who engage in the boundary disputes about human nature constantly are working for ways to preserve human uniqueness and will use any available method. Anyone who is so confused about human uniqueness as to have to defend its boundaries is hardly in a position to be objective about the language origin problem—for this is often merely a inetaphor about exactly the human-animal boundaries. Most of those who wish to protect the uniqueness of man with the concept of language are responding to an inner urge which has to do with politics, theology, or both (cf Adler 1967; Bronowski 1965). 17. The Psychology of Development continues to be concerned with mind/body dualism in a way which parallels and virtually caricatures the "origin of language" issue. The question which is generated by Piaget is how a "biological-reflex" creature comes to be rational. I suggest that there is a potential Anthro pology of Development, in which it is obvious that children turn out to be mostly like their parents and families and communi ties. (1970, 1970ms) "Rationality" is, in my view, some sort of statement about adultocentric views of themselves and the world. It is what the "normal" community agrees is rational. The con fusion is between the nature of growing up to be "rational" vs. becoming "adult". Since "rationality" as a social process is not a priori delimited, the proposed Anthropology of Development is potentially a comparative discipline; while the Psychology of Development is not and connot be comrarative, except within the confines of a particular definition of rationality. In a deep sense, the "problem" is exactly about such a definition, and "language" is merely a cover term for it.</page><page sequence="25">Sarles 173 18. The use of that term "speech" to designate what (other) animals utter verbally is opposed to "language", i.e. what human beings supposedly do. The term "speech", used in this way, is merely an icon for the "origin of language" prob lem. It has no basis in fact, and is used, in my experience, to stifle discussion. 19. Those who claim to study animal "calls" have fallen into the thinking mode that makes animals deficient human beings, without any clear acknowledgement of it. Marier's elegant ex position of the nature of (other) animals' "calls" is a human thought constructed about other animals and so irrefutable in its own terms: "In animals the tendency is ... to pack as much information as possible into single, indivisible signals. Thus a bird alarm call is at once a symbol for a predator and a direc tive to escape. The "roughgrunting" of chimpanzees announces the discovery of food and also invites others to come and share. This incorporation of noun and verb function in the same indivis ible signal greatly limits the possibilities of syntactical rearrange ment of signals to create new messages" (Marler, quoted in Stokoe 1975). The "callists" seem already to have decided that (other) animals do not have "language. " Marier's definition of calls is merely an irrefutable way to defend this earlier deicsion. Once he has dedided "calls" are "indivisible" (on what possible grounds?), he is free to go ahead and do what he wants with them. My diagnosis of callists' thinking is that they have already assumed a simpler-than-human basis for (other) animals. They have made a jump to thinking, suggesting that these calls are unitary and are about behavior which tends to be innate (part of the notion that other animals are "simple"). Calls are thus semantic, but in the sense of the very limited "intelligence" which these callists are willing to impute to (other) animals. In fact, on inspection of an oscilloscopic display of human and non-human "utterances", human sentences and animal "calls do not appear very different. (1967) How have Marler and others decided that the latter are indivisible? How did Marler conclude that animals' "incorpor ation of noun and verb function in the same indivisible signal greatly limits the possibilities ... to create new messages" ? I believe this had to have been decided in advance. It may or may not characterize (other) animals' verbal output—who knows? (For an earlier version of the same story: Plato's Protagoras.)</page><page sequence="26">174 Sign Language Studies 11 19 (cont'd). I have attempted to parody this bent of callists to simplify the nature of (other) animals in a paper ("Could a Non-H?" 1974a) speculating on whether an "outside" observer of the human species could possibly discover whether human kind have language. If the observer used the same assumptions and techniques which human beings use in "studying" the "calls" of (other) animals, he could not, I concluded—unless he were already willing to believe that we might have language. One suspects that the "callists" are not even aware that their "data base" is so heavily loaded with assumptions. My ultimate objection to the callists' thinking is that by tending to oversimplify (other) animals it has a parallel tendency to affect how we imagine human beings to be. The "human nature enterprise" or "border defense" is never far from the characterization of (other) animals. Statements such as Marier's above must be examined very carefully, not only for their basis in fact but also for their implications and entailments. (1975a) 20. One of the most fascinating aspects of studying (other) ani mals in their natural settings is that it is usually clear that we watch moving bodies. The fact that most behavioral scientists in the laboratory miss or dismiss the fact of bodies' moving is astounding to me. Of course the idea that human language provides a direct route into the human mind assists us in this most current annotation to Plato's banishment of time, the body, and (I suspect) the possibility of new knowledge about the human condition, (cf Chomsky 1968) 21. The "origin of language" problem tends to urge a sense of human language which is autonomous, language per se. Thence it is an easy jump to the study of "language" by whatever defin ition is "selling" as if it represents totally that which is uniquely and distinctly human. 22. A great deal of the discussion around this issue has to do with the issues of change and continuity; thus the earlier discussion of time and language. I suggest as an overarching strategy that we ought to assume change and attempt, at all moments, to account for (apparent) stability. This strategy has several advantages: (1) It will force us to examine what we mean by ideal or normal essential ist modes of behavior; (2) it provides an existential antidote to the Platonic propensity to "fix" time; (3) it will force us to take certain aspects of the human condition (e.g. aging) and examine whether they are attributes of being or consequences cf being social.</page><page sequence="27">Sarles 175 23. If one looks beneath the surface of the theories of many ethologists, one may begin to note how heavily animal commun ication work is influenced by a "mentalist" orientation, par ticularly when it comes to interpreting (other) animals' behavior. The intellectual shift which they (e.g. Lorenz) are attempting is to take intellective functions and show that some or most are non-plastic, not susceptible to learning or other forms of change, thus innate, genetic, in some seep sense. It must be admitted that Darwin's Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals sets up this possibility by assuming that "emotions" are inborn. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the "calls" of the modern animal behaviorist are akin to Darwin's "emotions", (cf Ekman 1975) It is not, however, sufficient to assume that the "emotions" are inbuilt, or even that we have direct access to knowledge about them. In the history of ideas, these emotions have been left in a kind of no-man's-land between "body" (animal) and "mind" (human), to be used as a convenient residuum whatever dualist mind-body theories are seen to be at impasse. In fact, many ethologists "describe" (other) animal movement with very little sense for how animals move from a kiniesiological perspec tive. Most could not, for example, distinguish a "balance maintaining" movement from a "gesture". Even "careful" descrip tivists, operating from a mentalist-dualist conceptual framework, can "disembody" the body while claiming to describe it. (1973a) 24. Human facial expression is part and parcel of the "origin of language" problem. If one assumes, as does Ekman (1975), following Darwin's Expression of Emotions. . ., that the face merely expresses a set (2 ,5 , 8, ... 1 ,000, 000 ?) of inborn emotions, the problem of understanding facial expression is but to separate the observed expressions into their "components". It seems to me, however, that this view is a consequence of the "origin of Language" issue: By oversimplifying (other) animals, we tend to see man as intrinsically simple. Man and (other) ani mals must be assumed to be complex—else we will not even see what there is to see. The observer who is prepared (in his mind's eye) to see or to sort, say, eight categories of behavior, will not continue to grow in his observational capacities. Most behavioral scientists claim, in defense of simple-mindedness, that one can not handle the enormous complexity; they want to simplify all for the sake of "management" and "control". In order for observers to get better at their trade, they must be prepared to see more at</page><page sequence="28">176 Sign Language Studies 11 24 (cont'd), all moments. This is true of any complicated skill in which mere practice is not sufficient to increase the skill (Here I speak as an amateur violinist). The human face remains poorly described, both in terms of its surface and of its underlying tissue! (cf Oyen 1974). 25. The visual aspects of human behavior—and for that matter, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, kinaesthetic—have also not appeared very prominently in theories of human lan guage. Vision is recognized as a sort of enabler, in the knowing of space and the external objective world. But vision tends to have been overlooked in thinking about language. Interestingly, the other senses seem not even to be thought of when it comes to ideas about language: Who has studied sentences as smell, touch, and the other adjectives? 26. Personal communication: Burton Shapiro, D.M.D., Ph.D., Chairman, Department of Oral Biology, University of Minnesota. 27. It may be stretching the point to suggest that mentation does not occur, as far as I can tell, with an untensioned tongue. At this very moment, the reader or hearer may note that the incredu lity he may feel about this argument is as surely fn his tongue as in his mind. It is also worth pointing out that people with pecu liar tongues and/or peculiarly shaped internal mouths are likely to appear "retarded" to most of us! 28. The claims that man's "mind" is "creative and infinite" are part and parcel also of the "origin of language" problem. It is, in one sense, merely another way of proclaiming man's uniqueness. Its theological relationships are clear: One has only to glance at the development of Aquinas' thought to see the mind become the soul, via the argument of the presumed "infinitude" of language. If man is infinite because he was constructed in the image of God, it follows directly that (other) animals must be "finite", at least for the dualist. The creativity argument is similar, and claims that man (alone) is not tied down by his instincts. But this follows also from the notion of unboundedness, which infinity presumes. (Other) animals are bounded, unfree in their "thought". It should be noted in these particular forms of the "problem", that theology and politics tend to merge with great ease and little notice--subtle and slippery.</page><page sequence="29">Sarles 177 29. In my view, so-called "retarded" persons are not neces sarily intellectually inferior to us "normals". In fact, it is the thinking which pervades the origin of language problem that leads us to think of them as deficient, more animaloid, thus stupider. We tend to apply this thinking to all the "less-civil ized" peoples of the world, the "primitives" , who have appeared to be intermediate between man and beast. Having observed mothers interacting with infant mongoloids (children with Down's Syndrome), I have reflected much about the nature of "retardation". This is a case where the perception of different faces leads us to believe that the minds behind these faces are different (and de fective) as well. But if one is treated as if he is stupid or crazy by other persons, it would be difficult to determine whether the differences (in appearance and behavior) are due to inherent stupidity (e.g. "brain damage") or to how we tend to interact with persons whose appearance is "strange". How do people get to look the way they do? (1972ms, 1973a, 1974a) 30. Many modern linguists have been moving to the study of "semantics", away from "syntax". Their error remains that they consider language to have some sort of autonomous existence. In the swinging intellectual pendulum--language and thought— we are moving rapidly toward the primacy of thought, language being how thoughts are expressed. A detailed analysis of lan guage, as it is presently conceptualized, cannot possibly yield more than a set of directions on where and when to observe social interaction. Language is a process, not an entity. (1967) But our techniques of linguistic analysis have been attempts to fix time, not to account for how we might understand one another in the ongoingness of life. The "body" of language has been as effectively banished from the study of verbal communication as the body of man and woman from the study of human nature. Since thought construction obviously determines what we see to an amazing extent (if the "origin of language" problem is any example), more observation is not the answer. (1974e) In my view, the conceptualization of language (human or other) has been afflicted by the need to probe those aspects of speech which we believed to be uniquely human. This has always led to mini mal theories about human language, and tends toward an over simplification of the human condition, especially in plitically pessimistic eras such as the present. The dignity and unique ness of man do not require defense; they demand understanding. The "origin of language" problem cannot lead us to an increase of understanding but will always tend to push us into the political-theological framework which underlies the formulations of "The Problem".</page><page sequence="30">178 Sign Language Studies 11 REFERENCES Adler, M.J. 1967 The Difference in Man and the Difference It Makes (New York, Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston).

Sarles of the Department of Anthropology at the Univer sity of Minnesota is an Anthropological Linguist and Human Ethol ogist. He took degrees at Buffalo and the University of Chicago. After doing language-and-culture fieldwork in Southern Mexico, he worked on problems in non-verbal communication processes at the Western Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Pittsburgh. For the past several years he has been trying to rethink problems of language and communication from a comparative perspective, writing diverse papers on the Question-Response Grammar in Language, the Problem of Intelligibility, etc. His interests in clude the study of cross-cultural communication, especially the problem of communicating across the various disciplines involved in the area of human nature and human communication.</page></plain_text>
