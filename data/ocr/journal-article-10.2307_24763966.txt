<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WORSHIP AND ICONOGRAPHY OF THE HINDU FOLK GODDESSES IN NATAL Alleyn Diesel Hinduism is unique among the world religions in its rich tradition of Goddess worship, both past and present. This situation is reflected in the Natal context where the veneration of the village or folk Goddesses is particularly prevalent among Hindus, and can be traced back to its practice in South India which the early Tamil settlers brought with them to South Africa from 1860 onwards. This article concentrates on the worship of these folk Goddesses, as this has been preserved and grown into a flourishing cult, in both rural and urban areas of Natal, and is no longer confined to Tamil circles. Introduction In India, worship of the Goddess goes back to pre-Aryan times, namely before 1500 BCE. The sites of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, part of the pre-Vedic Indus Valley civilization, have yielded hundreds of little terra-cotta female figures dating as far back as the third millennium BCE. These are almost certainly Goddess figures (Mookerjee 1988: 11-13). However, Goddess figures feature minimally in early Vedic/Aryan literature. Usas, the Goddess of the dawn, has twenty hymns in the Rig Veda, and although she is one of the most important Goddesses, she is not on a par with the most important Gods, for example, Agni, Indra and Soma. Other Goddesses in Vedic literature are Prithivi, Goddess of the earth; Aditi, mentioned frequently in connection with motherhood; Sarasvati, assocated with the river of the same name; and Vac, the Goddess of speech and truth. The Goddess Sri, mentioned once in the Rig Veda and more frequently in the Atharva Veda, later became linked with Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and good fortune. But none of the Goddesses who later became very important in Brahmanical Hinduism, such as Parvati, Durga, Kali, Radha and Sita are mentioned in the Vedas. By Classical times (500 BCE - 500 CE) both the great Gods Vishnu and Shiva are believed to have had female consorts, Lakshmi being the consort of Vishnu, and Uma/Parvati being the consort of Shiva.1 But from approximately the coming of the Aryans (c. 1500 BCE) until about the third or fourth century 3</page><page sequence="2">4 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 CE, nearly two thousand years, there is not much evidence for the worship of the Goddess. Then the evidence resumes, so that from the fifth and sixth centuries CE (some claim the third and fourth) the religion of the Goddess became as much a part of the written record as that of the male deities. During the sixth to eighth centuries (early Medieval times) some Hindus within the Shiva tradition elevated the divine female as consort into the divine female as great Goddess, so that the Goddess now enjoyed the position of Supreme Being in her own right. It is therefore possible to worship the Goddess as the Supreme Being who is herself Creator, Preserver and Destroyer (Devi Mahatmyam 1: 75).2 Since the reappearance of the Goddess in India, she has grown in strength and popularity, and is worshipped by many names, in many places today. India is unique in this reappearance of the Goddess. In Mediterranean and European culture the Goddess disappeared soon after the advent of Christianity, and, later, Islam imposed an even more severely patriarchal monotheism on the societies under its jurisdiction. Daniel Ingalls (Foreword to Brown 1974: xv) believes the Indian situation differs from that of other cultures because, firstly, India has always been more tolerant of religious diversity than Europe or the Middle East, so that different groups and villages were free to develop and follow their own beliefs. Secondly, Ingalls believes that the worship of the Goddess never really ceased in India. He says: The two-thousand-year silence of the record may be explained by the fact that all our texts from that period are either in Sanskrit or closely related languages, and there is no doubt that the Aryan-Sanskrit culture was strongly oriented toward masculine goals . . . The men and women who worshipped the Goddess are not likely in that period to have written at all; almost surely they did not write in Sanskrit. Our earliest Sanskrit hymns to the Goddess, according to this view, are the continuation of an old religion, not an innovation. The Goddess/Mother worship cult which has grown in India over the past several centuries is predominantly centred round Parvati, the consort of Shiva. The worship of the Goddess finds a natural home within Shaivism, where she is seen as the personification of the female energy (Shakti) of the more passive, contemplative Shiva. Shakti (Devi) is the generic name for Goddesses, particularly of the Shiva tradition, and means 'power', 'energy' or 'force'. Shiva himself is ambiguous -</page><page sequence="3">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 5 the Destroyer, and an ascetic, unkempt, outside of everyday society, but worshipped by millions as the only God. Yet, he is also regarded as saviour and protector. Sharing something of the complex character of Shiva, the Goddess has two sides to her nature, one mild and benevolent, the other fierce and at times malevolent. Her milder forms are Uma ('light'), Gauri ('golden' or 'brilliant'), Parvati ('mountaineer'), and Haimavati from her parents, the Himalayas; whereas some of her terrible forms are Durga ('the inaccessible'), Kali ('black'), Syama ('black'), Chandi and Chandika ('the fierce'), and Bharavi ('the terrible'). In this fierce form she needs to be placated, often with blood sacrifices. Her various names reflect the many-sided, complex nature and functions of the Goddess, for example, Kanya Kumari ('the youthful virgin'), Ambika ('the mother'), Vijaya ('the victorious'), Sati ('virtuous'), Sinha-vahani ('riding on a lion'), Jaganmata ('mother of the world'). Thus in India the Goddess can appear in many forms: as mother, as nature (earth), as life, as the beloved, and as the absolute. It is particularly in her fierce, darker forms or manifestations, such as Durga and Kali, that the Goddess is worshipped as an independent deity, which is why far more temples are dedicated to the dark Goddesses than to the light. The main text of Devi worshippers, which is read daily in her temples in India, is the Devi Mahatmya (c. 400 CE), the Glorification of Devi, a poem of 700 verses, and part of the Markandeya Purana. This text contains one of the most famous Goddess myths, that of the victory of the Goddess Durga over the Buffalo Demon, Mahisa. Of the worship of the Goddess in India today David Kinsley says: In contemporary Hinduism the number and popularity of goddesses are remarkable. No other living religious tradition displays such an ancient, continuous, and diverse history of goddess worship. The Hindu tradition provides the richest source of mythology, theology, and worship available to students interested in goddesses. (1986: 1) The popularity and widespread nature of Goddess worship is almost certainly attributable to the powerful and clearly observable role of the human mother who bears new offspring from her body, and nourishes and nurtures these; and to the transference of this imagery to the fertile earth (Mother) who also produces and nourishes life, and finally, at death, takes it back into her dark womb. Thus the Mother Goddess represents both the life-giving, nurturing processes, and the related processes of disintegration, death and decay. Life and</page><page sequence="4">6 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 death are inextricably linked, and both are essential for the continuation of existence. Margaret Stutley explains this: Sakti is the overflowing cosmic energy through which gods, worlds and all creatures come into being. In fact, she is indistinguishable from Nature (prakrti). Yet even in her fierce aspect, she protects those of her children who can overcome their fears and terrors of the inevitable process of continuous change and decay she represents, to see also her transcendent beauty and the eternal bliss that ultimately she bestows on her worshippers. (1985: 47) The Village Goddess Tradition in India The village or folk tradition in India, which involves the worship of predominantly female deities, almost certainly has roots stretching back to pre-Aryan times (Whitehead 1988: 11, 17). Although in many ways it is discontinuous with the Brahmanical or 'great' tradition of Goddess worship, in other ways it is continuous. Unlike the Brahmanical Goddesses which are pan-Indian in their appeal, the village or guardian Goddesses (also known as gramadevata) are particularly identified with a specific village and are worshipped by its inhabitants. There may be more than one in a village, but some of them are completely unknown outside their own village. Some, however, have a wider, more regional, recognition, such as Mariyamman in South India, and Manasa in North India. With regard to their function, Brubaker says: . . . some village deities preside over marriage, conception, or childbirth; some aid in agricultural fertility; some protect herds, fields, wells, granaries, or the village boundaries; some have powers to exorcise ghosts or demons; some guard against or heal snakebite or a specific illness . . . (1983: 148) And Whitehead says: Siva and Vishnu may be more dignified beings, but the village deity is regarded as a more present help in trouble, and is more intimately concerned with the happiness and prosperity of the villagers. (1988: 16)</page><page sequence="5">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 7 Their names often indicate their character and function. Whitehead records such names as Pandilamma, the Goddess from Pandil; Mamillamma, the Goddess who sits under a mango tree; Kokkalamma, Goddess of coughs; Poleramma and Ellamma, both boundary Goddesses. 'Amma' or 'Amman' simply means 'mother' or 'respected woman' (cf. Amba, Ambika, Ma, Mata). There are also Goddesses from the 'great' tradition who have been added to the folk (or 'little') tradition, such as Kaliamma (Kali), and Gengamma (Ganga), the water Goddess of the Ganges. In turn, there has been some annexing of these folk Goddesses onto the Shiva tradition, so that, in a sense, they are all regarded as forms of Shiva's consort, Parvati. Perhaps this attempt to establish a link with the Brahmanical tradition was in order to gain greater status for the folk divinities. Although these folk Goddesses abound throughout India, they are especially prevalent in the south, possibly because the patriarchal Aryan influence was not felt so strongly here among the ancient Dravidian groups who had long venerated the female principle. Kinsley points out that despite their great numbers and variety of functions, these folk deities share a considerable number of characteristics in common. Firstly, unlike the Brahmanical Goddesses, these folk Goddesses are often not represented by anthropomorphic images, but by natural features such as trees, unhewn stones, or even anthills, an indication of their close associations with the natural world. Secondly, they are concerned with local interests, particularly the well-being of the village and its inhabitants. As protector of the village the Goddess is also Mother (Amman) of the village; she gives birth to it, as its Creator, and, in a sense, they live on her body, the earth. She is therefore worshipped to ensure fertility of earth, animals and humans; prosperity in the form of rain and good crops; and protection from famine, disease, demons and early death. She is considered as 'married' to the village. She and the village are dependent on one another, and her fate and theirs are inextricably bound together. Thus, an outbreak of disease among the villagers is an indication that the Mother, too, is afflicted, and her cure will be their cure, and vice-versa. Thirdly, like some of the darker Goddesses of the Shiva tradition, these deities are frequently seen as violent, even punishing, Mothers, directly associated with disasters, diseases and death. This is evidence of their complex and ambivalent natures. Of this Kinsley writes: When the village is threatened by disaster, particularly epidemics, the local goddess is usually said to be manifesting herself. She erupts onto the</page><page sequence="6">8 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 village scene along with disasters that threaten the stability, and even the survival of the village. Furthermore, her role vis-a-vis such epidemics or disasters is ambivalent. She is perceived both as inflicting these disasters and as protecting the village from them. (1986: 198) Thus these Goddesses are not primarily associated with calm and peacefulness, but with the darker, fierce, untamable sides of human life and the natural world. Their characteristics are independence, arousal, anger, ferocity, destruction and a general lack of predictability, perhaps reflecting the sometimes terrifying and unpredictable Indian climate. They are reminders that those same forces of nature that uphold the stability of life and the social order, also ultimately threaten its existence. Thus most of their ceremonies and festivals involve a considerable number of propitiatory rituals. Fourthly, another characteristic of these village Goddesses, where they differ from most of the Brahmanical Goddesses, is that they usually do not have male consorts. This independence from male control sometimes results in their being described as 'virgin', although this does not necessarily mean sexually inexperienced or inactive, but undominated, 'her own person'. Thus her status as virgin and mother is not as paradoxical as it at first seems, and is not without parallels in other religious traditions, e.g. ancient Greek religion and Catholic Christianity. This sexual independence also reflects the potentially dangerous nature of the Goddesses, as in a sense they are not answerable to any external authority. By contrast, the Brahmanical Goddesses with male partners, such as Lakshmi, Sarasvati and Parvati, are usually gentle and mild, free of the uncontrolled wildness often manifested by the sexually independent God desses. This ambivalent sexuality of the folk Goddesses is also reflected in their mythology which often involves stories of a faithful and virtuous woman, unjustly and violently treated by men, sometimes through sexual assault. The woman expresses her outrage in destructive anger and revenge, and is then transformed into a Goddess.3 (This applies in the myths associated with the Goddesses Draupadi, Mariamman, and Angalamman, all of whom are worshipped in Natal.) This is reminiscent of the virgin Goddess Durga, of the 'great' tradition, who rejects the sexual advances of all male suitors, and is victorious in battle over a male demon. These myths are often recounted or acted as dramas at the festivals of the folk Goddesses. Linked to this is the tradition that many village Goddesses demand blood sacrifices of male animals, who are often seen as representing either her 'husband' or some other opponent.4 Kinsley comments: 'The goddesses still</page><page sequence="7">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 9 need males to invigorate them, but they ensure that the males will not dominate them or threaten their powers' (1986: 202). Blood sacrifice has long been associated with Kali and Durga, of the Brahmanical tradition, both of whom are depicted as thirsty for the blood of their male opponents. So, too, many folk Goddesses thirst particularly for the blood of buffaloes, which is reminiscent of the buffalo demon, symbol of chaos and destruction, slain by Durga. The blood of the victims is seen as placating and cooling the Goddess's anger, and/or as revitalizing her by offering her the life of these creatures. What Kinsley says of such sacrifices to Durga, seems appropriate for all Goddesses: 'To replenish her powers, to reinvigorate her, she is given back life in the form of animal sacrifices. The blood in effect resupplies her so that she may continue to give life in return' (1986: 113). And Erich Neumann points to the universality of this practice: ... the Great Goddess everywhere demands sacrifices . . . Because the decisive moments of life of the female - menstruation, deflowering, conception, and childbearing - are intimately bound up with a sacrifice of blood, the goddess perpetuates life by exacting bloody sacrifices that will assure the fertility of game, women, and fields, the rising of the sun, and success in warfare. (1963: 279) Much of this behaviour on the part of the folk Goddesses is a reversal of the usually expected male and female roles in Indian society. And the Goddess's power is directly linked to her independence and sexual abstinence. Conserving sexual energy is believed to constitute the kind of austerity that generates 'tapas', great spiritual heat, which can be expressed either positively or negatively. Brubaker believes that an understanding of the role of the 'untamed' village Goddesses can be found in the male fear of the female, especially the power of her sexuality. He points out that in India, in particular, there is the belief 'that women have stronger sexual drives than men - drives which if properly controlled and sublimated, can produce a saintliness beyond the capacity of the male, but which, if allowed to run rampant, can be very threatening to men' (1983: 159). So, women should be married and under the supervision of males, so that their powerful and potentially dangerous sexuality can be expressed in safely controlled ways. But, Kinsley points out that village Goddess myths often show that it is males who are violent and disruptive in society, so that the Goddess is then needed to protect and preserve the stability of life. This is her role as fiercely protective Mother.</page><page sequence="8">10 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 In Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the Goddess frequently has male guardians, who are her subor dinates. They are also sometimes her erstwhile enemies who have been converted to devotees and are now the protectors of her shrines. Of this whole interesting phenomonon of the Amman Goddesses, Kinsley says, 'The ultimate mystery and potency of these village/disease goddesses may well lie precisely in the fact that their ambivalent natures are not capable of being comprehended rationally' (1986: 208). The Folk Goddesses in Natal In Natal the four folk Goddesses Mariamman, Draupadi, Angalamman, and Genga (Gengaiamman) appear to hold the most prominent and influential positions in the tradition of Goddess veneration, all of them having shrines dedicated to their worship. There are other folk Goddesses venerated in Natal, such as Poongavana Amman and the rather mysterious Seven Sisters, but they do not stand out to the same extent. Although these Goddesses in their Natal context display most of the characteristics of their Indian counterparts, certain modifications in their worship have crept in during the one hundred and thirty years in South Africa. This is partly because in South Africa these Goddesses have been adapted to urban conditions, with a much wider, all-Natal consistency, so that they can no longer be regarded as purely 'village', rural deities, where each little community imposes its local idiosyncrasies on its particular Goddess, as tends to happen in India. For example, all rituals pertaining to boundaries appear to have been abandoned. In India a clear distinction is made between the Goddesses of the Brahmanical Shakti tradition, and those of the folk tradition and Amman cults of South India. Brahman priests will usually not take part in the rituals of the latter. However, South African Hindus appear not to be as aware of this distinction. Related to this, another difference is that, whereas in India Goddess temples stand alone on their sites, in South Africa, because Hindus are a minority community with limited space and funds, most Goddess temples share the same grounds as temples from the classical tradition; most usually Shiva temples, but occasionally Vishnu temples. And pictures of Kali, Durga and other Goddesses of the great tradition are usually displayed in the temples of the folk Goddesses. This close association of traditions means, further, that priests from the Shiva or Vishnu temples also usually officiate at the Goddess shrines. (Most of these priests are not Brahmans, mainly because there is a</page><page sequence="9">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 11 shortage of such people in Natal.) In general, Natal Hindus appear to have carefully preserved the ritual of Amman worship, but, during the years of separation from the Motherland, have tended to lose much of the mythology associated with the various deities. Mariamman Mariamman is without doubt the most widely worshipped of the village Goddesses in Natal. She is the South Indian Tamil counterpart of Sitala, the North Indian Goddess of smallpox and other infectious diseases. As indicated above, Mariamman is widely venerated in a number of South Indian states, and Brubaker reports that'. . . in some places Mariyamman has acquired sizable temples, Brahmin priests, and other marks of a more-than-folk status (1983: 146). In keeping with her complex nature, the Goddess is believed to cause the disease, she is the disease, which she too suffers, and eventually she cures the disease. For many Hindus, all foods and many pther substances are considered to be either heating or cooling, and individuals should endeavour to keep an even balance in their lives, verging somewhat on the cool side. Infectious diseases are thus manifestations of the overheating of the body (Beck 1969: 563). The cause of an epidemic is believed to be the Goddess's anger, which might be aroused as a result of her neglect by her devotees, or by her being attacked by evil demons from outside the village. This results in her becoming overheated, so that she then chooses to possess certain individuals, thus inflicting on them the disease, with its accompanying fever. However, contrary to this always being seen as an evil, it is sometimes spoken of as her 'grace'. The cure, therefore, involves various rituals which will cool both the Goddess and her human sufferers, such as offering cooling foods, fanning, and placing pots of cool water in strategic positions (Kuper 1960: 251-253). (Note: the name Sitala means 'the cool one'.) Such an epidemic would, in the past, be the occasion of a festival in honour of the Goddess as an attempt to appease and cool her. Of this Kinsley says: Like the disease itself, the village goddess seems to erupt on the scene, to wake up from a state of quiescence to a state of frenzied activity. During an epidemic, or during her festival, which often coincides with an epidemic, the village goddess forces herself on the awareness of the villagers. (1986: 204) And Brubaker explains:</page><page sequence="10">12 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 ... in the ensuing festival the people are caught up in a contagion of intense and dramatic ritual action - action as overheating, perhaps as delirious, and at least as defiling as the disease itself. In its festival the community behaves in many ways like the human body struggling to expel a virulent infection. (1983: 153) The practice in present day Natal (and apparently in some contemporary Indian communities), where smallpox and other such diseases are no longer so rampant, is to hold a regular annual festival to the Goddess. This frequently takes place during the Tamil month of Adi (July/August) which both in India and in South Africa is the time of the year when such diseases have been prevalent. (The month of Adi is especially dedicated to the Goddess, and is regarded as a particularly inauspicious month, when one should not embark on events such as marriage or new business. Even children conceived or born during this time are sometimes considered to be unlucky [Kuper 1960: 207]). The name 'Mari-amman' reflects something of her ambiguous death bestowing and life-giving nature, as 'mari' can mean both 'death' (in Sanskrit) and 'rain' (in Tamil), a reminder of her apparent control over the fertilizing rains (Beck 1969: 571). Beck also records that Mariamman is sometimes known as Paccaiyamman, the 'green goddess', green being associated with rain (1969: 561). Mariamman temples are popular and numerous in Natal, and observe her festival annually, usually in July/August (Adi). There are at least sixteen such temples spread throughout Natal (cf. list of Goddess temples), the best known being the Isipingo Rail Mariamman Temple, where for ten days every Easter an extremely popular and well attended festival is held. Thousands of devotees from all over the country arrive to offer devotions to the Goddess, often in fulfilment of vows taken in order to ensure her blessing. The Goddess's ability to heal is emphasised at this festival, and vendors sell small aluminium representations of various parts of the body, such as a hand, foot or an eye, which are offered as part of the petition for healing of a particular organ or limb, or even for the birth of a child. The Mariamman Festival is also known as the Porridge Festival/Prayer, and Amman Prayer. The main festival day usually involves a procession with garagams (karagams: decorated pots which are symbols of the Goddess), trances (possession by the Goddess), and the offering of 'cooling' foodstuffs such as special porridge, fruits, rice, dhal and milk to the Goddess. The porridge, known as 'kulu', is made from fermented maize, sour milk and</page><page sequence="11">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 13 onions. It is prepared and placed in buckets with syringa leaves tied around them. Both the porridge (which is fed to patients who have the fever), and the syringa leaves (which are placed in the sick room) are believed to have a cooling effect on the overheated state of the patient and the Goddess. Blood sacrifice is a traditional part of local Mariamman festivals, in order, as mentioned above, to placate, cool and reinvigorate her. Although it is not as commonly practised today as it was in the past, it still plays a part at the Isipingo Temple, as well as at the Shree Poongavana Amman Temple, and the Shri Angalamman Temple, both in Cato Manor. Interestingly, all these temples are privately owned. In Natal the victims are usually goats and chickens, the latter of which are offered in their thousands during the festival period at the Isipingo Temple. These sacrifices are offered by individuals in fulfilment of vows made to the Goddess. Because there has been some disapproval of this expressed by many Hindus, it is also possible to offer live fowls to the Goddess, and these are received by the officials and then thrown up into a pen on the roof of the temple, presumably to be resold or killed later. A number of private Mariamman festivals are held at homes throughout Natal, and at some of these, blood offerings are also performed. One that I attended in a back garden in Raisethorpe in Pietermaritzburg in August 1990, included a crowd of about eighty invited guests. A small shrine to Mariamman had been constructed from bamboo covered with material, and decorated with syringa leaves, with her picture placed inside. Outside, facing her, was a picture of Madurai Veeran, her guardian. After a number of preliminary prayers, during which an elderly woman went into a trance and blessed participants, three goats were marked with turmeric, and then swiftly beheaded with a large scythe-like knife. I was told that it was essential for all sacrificial animals to be male, which is in line with practice in India. The goats' heads, together with those of about twenty chickens, were placed in front of the Goddess, after which everyone busied themselves preparing a meal of curry from the sacrificed animals, as well as serving the sour porridge which had been prepared beforehand. Elmore suggests that these meals, prepared from the flesh of sacrificed animals, should be seen specifically as sacrificial meals, shared with the Goddess, and serving to cement a new bond of peace and friendship with her (1984: 151; Whitehead 1988: 144). With regard to the iconography of Mariamman, one of her main symbols is her vehicle the lion, which is linked to the lion/tiger that Durga rides in her victorious battle over Mahisa. (The fierce cats - powerful mothers and hunters - have been the companions of Goddesses from very early times, in</page><page sequence="12">14 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 many cultures, e.g. Innana in Sumer, and Isis in Egypt.) The Pietermaritzburg 'Marriamen' Temple has Mariamman seated on her lion mount on the outside pediment. Mariamman's temples often have fairly anthropomorphic images in the form of a female figure, usually dressed in red, as can be found in the Pietermaritz burg and Jacobs Road temples. However, the Illovo Temple has her represented only by a head with large, staring eyes, while in her Sezela Temple, also on the south coast, there is simply a triangular-shaped, clay head which looks as though it is growing out of the earth. Quite often unhewn stones are present at her temples, sometimes dotted with pink kum-kum, reminders of her connections with the pox. Swords are often placed next to her image. These are associated with her ferocity and also probably with the weapons of Shiva. In front of the image of Mariamman at her festivals, a trident is stuck into the ground, with a rope whip entwined round it, and a sword, often with pink dots, leaning against it. Syringa leaves are placed next to this. Snakes are also associated with Mariamman, the Isipingo Temple being built over a sacred cobra hole, and the Pietermaritzburg 'Marriamen' Temple having a snake shrine just outside. Offerings of milk and eggs are placed at these spots daily. Commenting on the worship of cobras in South India, Whitehead says, 'In many towns and villages large slabs of stone with figures of cobras, often two cobras intertwined, carved in bas-relief are seen on a platform under a large tree. They are worshipped by women who want children' (1988: 22). There is such a stone with two intertwined snakes near the rear of the Draupadiamman Temple in Cato Manor. (See below for comment on the connection of cobras with anthills.) Draupadi Draupadi is the Goddess of firewalking and is another very popular folk Goddess in Natal. In the South African context her worship appears to be confined to Natal, as Hindus in the other provinces of this country do not observe the firewalking festival. Firewalking is practised at four traditional temples in Natal: the 'Marriamen' Temple in Pietermaritzburg; the Umbilo Shree Draupadiamman Alayam in the grounds of the Umbilo 'Second River' Temple in Cato Manor, Durban; the Mariamman Temple in the grounds of the Shree Murugar Alayam, Jacobs Road, Clairwood, Durban; and the Glencoe Hindu Temple, in Northern Natal. Recently three newer temples in Chatsworth, Durban, have started observing this festival (Diesel: 1990 &amp; 1991).</page><page sequence="13">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 15 The process by which Draupadi, the heroine of the great epic the Mahabharata, became the South Indian Goddess of the firewalking cult is very complex, and is dealt with in detail by Alf Hiltebeitel (1988). In the Mahabharata there are a number of references linking Draupadi with fire; for example, she was born from the sacrificial fire prepared by her father, Drupada; her brother, Dhrstadyumna, is an incarnation of Agni the God of fire; she narrowly escaped being burnt on the funeral pyre of Kicaka; as well as surviving the great forest fire she and her husbands were caught in during their years in exile. But there are no references in the classical Sanskrit Mahabharata to her walking through fire, nor is she there regarded as a Goddess. Hiltebeitel points to the existence of a Tamil version of the Mahabharata compiled by Villiputtur Alvar, probably dating from c. 1400 CE, containing various additions favourable to the themes of the South Indian Draupadi cult, which are absent from the Sanskrit epic. This, and a number of popular street dramas (Terukkuttu), which are folk modifications of the classical tradition, weave stories that emphasise and heighten such themes as the imagery of fire; the various trials, humiliations and defilements endured by Draupadi, leading to her vows of violent, bloody revenge; and her 'untouchability' and 'virginity'. These finally culminate in her identity as the fierce, potentially destructive, village Goddess, or Mother, of fire. Thus Hiltebeitel maintains '. . . the Draupadi cult intertwines the mytholo gies of local "village goddesses" . . . and the Mahabharata' (1988: 135). He goes on: Indeed, the recurrent imagery of the goddess's sufferings - her marital humiliations, sexual violations, and encounters with defilement and impurity - find countless variations in the myths of village, caste, and lineage goddesses and point to some of the most fundamental and determinative themes of their cults. (1988: 265) He quotes from songs from South Indian Draupadi festivals which reflect this belief in Draupadi as Goddess (1988: 9): You are the Primal Sakti, Mother Draupadi, Who came and rose from fire, O Mother . . . Not touchable, my mother, you are the fire, mother Who cannot be controlled by anyone else, my mother Draupadi. You are the great fire, my mother, not touchable . . .</page><page sequence="14">16 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 Thus South Indians have come to accept several stories which tell of Draupadi walking through the fire, either to confirm her chastity, or to purify herself from a number of attempts to defile her (particularly by Duhsasana, who at the command of Duryodhana, dragged Draupadi by her hair and attempted to disrobe her;5 and by Kicaka, brother-in-law of the king of Virata, who insulted her and tried to seduce her). Stories of her firewalk place this incident either before the great battle of Kurukshetra, claiming that Draupadi walked through the fire in order to confirm her purity and chastity after each of her marriages, or to confirm her chastity after Kicaka's attempt at defilement; or, after the battle, as a final demonstration of her sexual purity. This explains why most Natal Tamil people I have spoken to about Draupadi walking through fire have been adamant that the account is contained in the Mahabharata, and yet I was unable to trace this when I searched the classical version. I have been told both the pre-battle version of her firewalking between each of her marriages, and the post-war incident. Most of my informants certainly did not have access to any version of the Mahabharata, but were almost certainly relying on orally relayed accounts, obviously from South Indian Tamil sources. Although Hiltebeitel maintains that it is impossible accurately to date the beginning of the South Indian Draupadi cult, he thinks it was probably consolidated during the 14th century (1988: 17). The centre of this, he maintains, was the town of Gingee in Tamilnadu, which even today appears to be the centre of the Draupadi firewalking cult. There are a total of 408 Draupadi temples in Tamilnadu and the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In the various dramas performed as part of the Draupadi festivals, Hiltebeitel detects images identifying Draupadi with the Goddesses Kali and Durga. For example, in what he calls the 'forest Draupadi' with her hair dishevelled, thirsting for revenge and the blood of Duryodhana, he sees a clear form of Kali, and again, later, after the battle and the death of Duryodhana, when Draupadi stands victorious on his body, she assumes a stance characteristic of Kali standing on the body of Shiva. Reminiscent of the mythology of the village Goddesses, it is the attempted violation of Draupadi's chastity that has stirred up her violent female nature with its potential for revenge and the bringing of affliction. However, the vindicated Draupadi is also finally referred to as 'Vijaya' ('Victorious'), which is an epithet of the victorious Durga after her slaying of the demon. She also becomes connected with the lion, the vehicle of Durga, and of other South Indian village Goddesses like Mariamman.</page><page sequence="15">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 17 Hiltebeitel thus claims that the dramas leading up to, and including, the eighteen day war 'can mark the completion of a festival - often in nine or ten days - that recapitulates the Navaratra and Vijaydasami to Durga' (1988: 434). The Draupadi festival finally reaches its climax in the firewalking ritual. The attempted sexual violation of the Goddess produced in her a heated state, which was finally cooled with her vindication, and the ritual worship of her devotees, so that in her newly acquired cool state she precedes them across the fire pit, cooling the coals for them, so that those with faith will emerge unscathed, and the new healthy, cool state will pervade the entire community (Beck 1969: 564). Beck also points out that in Hindu mythology 'rebirth from fire is a common theme' (1969: 557). The Draupadi cult is therefore rather different from the usual pattern of Indian village worship in that it comes originally from the Brahmanical (Mahabharata) tradition, and was later modified and integrated into the South Indian folk Goddess tradition. In South Africa, as far as I am aware, there is only one temple specifically dedicated to Draupadi: the Umbilo Shree Draupadiamman Alayam, in Cato Manor. In this country Draupadi is usually housed in Mariamman temples, which is very appropriate, as she shares many of her characteristics. (Biardeau reports that in India firewalking is also occasionally practised in honour of Mariamman (Hiltebeitel 1990: 23).) This Draupadiamman Temple is apparently the only temple which still performs the Terukkuttu drama 'Eighteen Day Battle' during the night preceding the firewalking, locally known as Six Foot Dance. Kuper records that this was regularly performed at all temples which held firewalking ceremonies, but this seems to have been stopped at most places, probably largely because it involves too much expense (1960: 218). This is a clear instance of the loss of mythology by the South African community. I am told that there are only about six or seven very elderly men who are still able to perform this drama, and nobody has been primed to take over from them when they are no longer able to continue. Hiltebeitel records a number of ritual implements associated with Draupadi. Those which have featured most prominently at Natal festivals recently are the whip and the garagam. The whip usually consists of plaited rope, and is carried by various people who go into trances. It is sometimes used in a somewhat threatening way to strike at people who are regarded as being too close to the possessed person, or it is held stretched taut above their heads as people dance in their trances. There are always many garagams at firewalking festivals,</page><page sequence="16">18 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 carefully constructed before the procession leaves for the temple. Some are very tall and elaborate, a few having clay faces just above the brass pots, often with long Kali-like tongues protruding from their mouths. A special devotee is usually chosen to be the first to walk across the fire carrying one of the large garagams, which represents the Goddess herself crossing the fire ahead of her devotees.6 The trident of Shiva is also very much in evidence, as is the sword, both often carried by devotees, reminders that these fierce Goddesses belong within the Shaivite tradition. The trident, whip and a pot are often to be seen next to the lion-decorated kodi pole outside the Draupadiamman Temple in Cato Manor. Some of these ritual implements are reminders of Durga's weapons with which she slew the demon, and according to Hiltebeitel can thus be seen as the weapons by which the Goddess (Durga/Draupadi) overcomes various evils that threaten the world. Possession is often a feature of this festival in India, and Hiltebeitel points out that this tends mostly to be part of lower caste folk ritual, and often affects women more than men. 'The trance', as already mentioned, plays a very prominent part at local festivals, and is particularly prevalent among women, many of whom get very fierce, somewhat alarming, Goddess trances, which cause them to act in a wild and apparently uncontrolled fashion. Angalamman The worship of the folk Goddess Ankalamman (Angalamman) is preserved in Natal at the privately owned Shree Angalamman Temple in Dromore Road, Cato Manor, Durban. Sometimes the name Kali is also included in the name of this temple, reflecting the belief that, like her sister Goddess Draupadi, Angalamman is regarded as a form of the fierce Goddess Kali. She is also sometimes seen as a form of Parvati. Her image in anthropomorphic form is also featured in the Jacobs Road Mariamman Temple, where she is in the company of Mariamman and Draupadi, and was referred to as Angalasperi. Her close links with Draupadi are confirmed by the fact that in South India the Ankalamman cult shares the same basic region as that of Draupadi, and Hiltebeitel believes that its existence, like that of the Draupadi cult, can also probably be traced back to the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries (1988: 101). Whitehead describes 'Angalamma' as having a violent temper, and says, 'The people worship her to avoid falling victims to her unquenchable anger,</page><page sequence="17">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 19 since her main object is believed to be to devour and consume everything that comes in her way. She is said especially to have a great relish for bones!' (1988: 30,31). Apparently there is in India a crematorium ceremony associated with this Goddess where she is known as the Goddess who pulls out the intestines and wears them as a garland (Hiltebeitel 1988: 101). This is reminiscent of Kali, inhabitor of graveyards, fearless of blood, death and destruction. Possession is also a part of the worship of Angalamman. Elmore reports that she is often represented simply by an unhewn stone or a pot (1984: 18). The Angalamman festival, which is held annually in March at the Cato Manor Temple, is similar to those of other village Goddesses, and still involves the sacrifice of goats and chickens. Gengaiamman In South Africa, as in India, the Goddess Ganga, the personification of the sacred river Ganges, has been annexed to the folk tradition. In the classical Hindu tradition Ganga is seen as the daughter of Himavat and Mena, and the sister of the Goddess Uma, who is one of the consorts of Shiva. Thus she is associated with the Shaivice Goddesses. However, Elmore believes that the village Goddess 'Gangamma' does not have any Brahmanic origins, but that she was the chief Goddess of a shepherd caste, possessing 'all the characteristics of the other Dravidian deities (1984: 107). Whitehead records her veneration in South India as 'Gangamma, the water goddess . . (1988: 23). I am aware of three temples in Natal specifically dedicated to Genga: the best known is the Shri Gengaiammen Shrine in Bellair Road, Cato Manor, built in 1909 over a large anthill; the Gengaiamman Temple on the banks of the Umkumbaan river near the Cato Manor Hindu Temple; and the small Genga Tempte in Mount Edgecombe. They are all old wood and iron structures. The Bellair Road Temple has a small triangular shaped unhewn stone at the foot of its kodi pole, which on festival days is carefully decorated with a marigold garland and a yellow ribbon. But the main focus of veneration here is the anthill, which, as a manifestation of the Goddess, is washed, decorated and worshipped daily. Anthills (more accurately termite mounds) are regarded by many traditional Hindus not as the homes of ants, but as mysterious outcrops emanating from Mother Earth, and therefore as manifestations of the Goddess herself. They are also often believed to be inhabited by snakes, the guardians of the treasures of the earth, and also thus associated with the Goddess. Srinivas, and others,</page><page sequence="18">20 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 confirm this belief in the Indian context: 'Among Hindus all over India, cobras and the anthills in which they live are worshipped on certain occasions' (1952: 160 &amp; 179; O'Malley 1935: 166; Irwin 1982). Other sacred anthills in Natal include that in the Mariamman Temple at Mount Edgecombe, one in the grounds of the 'Second River' Temple in Cato Manor, and one next to the Poongavana Amman Temple, also in Cato Manor. The Bellair Road Gengaiammen Temple celebrates an annual ten day Gengaiammen Garagam (Porridge) Festival in May, which in the last few years has been planned to coincide with national Mothers' Day. The festival on Sunday 12th May 1991 was claimed as the 82nd such occasion. The flag marking the beginning of the festival is raised on the Friday ten days before the main festival day which is on the Sunday. Gengaiamman's flag bears the lion, marking her relationship to the other fierce Goddesses. Interestingly, recent handbills advertising the festival have clearly stated 'No sacrifice'. This festival consists mainly of a procession which starts from a spot across the road from the temple, where the preparations take place, and which circumambulates the temple and kodi pole three times. Finally all those carrying offerings and garagams enter the temple to place these before the Mother. The festival is particularly characterised by the carrying of garagams (as the name suggests), and by trance, as well as the feature that all participants in the procession walk the entire distance on sarees which are continually spread out in front as the procession approaches. One informant suggested that as Genga is particularly the Goddess of water, the sarees represent the flowing river, but it would also appear to be related to the belief that the possessed are considered sacred, so that they should walk on clean, purified ground. The vast majority of the participants are women, and at the lunch afterwards it is customary for the men to serve the women, in order, I was told, to honour motherhood. Sour porridge is cooked in large pots over open fires, and sweet rice is served to people before the lunch. Some other symbols associated with the Goddesses in Natal In addition to those already mentioned, namely, the lion, the trident, the whip, unhewn stones, anthills, snakes, and garagams, there are a number of other symbols frequently found in connection with Goddess worship in Natal. Pots or vessels: In both India and South Africa, pots, either empty or filled</page><page sequence="19">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 21 with water or milk, are very frequently seen at Goddess shrines, and as part of festivals, particularly in the form of the colourfully decorated garagam. Mariamman and Draupadi are also frequently depicted holding 'fire pots', known as 'Kambalam'. This vessel symbolism is not confined to the Hindu Goddesses, but appears to have been part of Goddess worship from very ancient times, and in many different parts of the world. Many pots have actually been designed in the shape of women, or with women's faces, or even with nipples on them (e.g. the 'nipple jars' from Minoan Thera). Earthenware pots with women's faces modelled in relief on the sides are often apparent at the firewalking festivals in Natal. Erich Neumann claims that the vessel is the central symbol of the female, the 'life vessel', in which life forms and is nurtured, and which 'provides the unborn as well as the born with food and drink' (1963: 42). He says, 'At the centre of the feminine elementary character in which the woman contains and protects, nourishes and gives birth, stands the vessel, which is both attribute and symbol of the feminine nature' (1963: 120). He goes on to point out that the belly and the breasts are obvious parts of vessel symbolism.7 But just as the belly/womb symbolism can also suggest cave/tomb/ underworld/hell, so the vessel of life can also become the funerary urn, drawing all life back into itself at death. So Neumann sees the vessel symbolism itself reflecting the ambiguous nature of the Great Mother: 'Just as the Great Mother can be terrible as well as good, so the Archetypal Feminine is not only a giver and protector of life but, as container, also holds fast and takes back; she is the goddess of life and death at once' (1963: 45). Quoting G. E. Smith, Neumann continues: 'The Mother Pot is really a fundamental conception in all religions, and is almost world-wide in its distribution. The pot's identity with the Great Mother is deeply rooted in ancient belief through the greater part of the world.' He also reports that Briffault called attention to 'the presence of the Mother Goddess as a pot in southern India' (1963: 132).8 The yoni: Representations of the yoni, the female reproductive organ, are found in some Goddess temples, both in India and South Africa. This is often combined with the lingam, and Mookerjee points out that in these models it is the yoni which supports the lingam, which emerges from it. He says: 'This fundamental relationship of linga and yoni has been obscured by patriarchal interpretation, yet the emphasis on linga-worship could not suppress the widespread rituals surrounding the ever-creative yoni' (1988: 47). I have observed models of yonis moulded from mealie meal, which were among the</page><page sequence="20">22 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 offerings at the Pietermaritzburg Mariamman festival. Cowrie shells are also found at some Goddess temples because their shape suggests that of the yoni. Cow-dung: Cow-dung, and all the four other products of the cow (urine, milk, curds, and ghee) are regarded by virtually all Hindus as powerfully purifying and auspicious, as well as being useful. As a symbol of fertility, cow-dung is sometimes to be seen placed on the bali pitham below the kodi pole at Natal temples. The Goddess Lakshmi (Sri), associated with good fortune and prosperity, is often referred to as 'Karisin', meaning 'abounding in dung' (Stutley 1985: 49). The colour red: The images of many Hindu Goddesses are often clothed in red or painted red. This appears to represent blood, and serves as a reminder of both the life-giving and destructive powers of the Goddess. It is also thus a fertility symbol, calling to mind menstrual blood, and the blood associated with birth and death (cf. Neumann's statement above about sacrificial blood being a reminder of 'the decisive moments of life of the female') (1963: 279).9 As with much of the symbolism of religious ritual, the people involved in the performance of this Goddess worship might not understand much of its meaning, but they preserve it faithfully from generation to generation, with some instinctive feeling that it connects deeply with many fundamental human needs. Guardians of the Goddesses As stated above, traditionally South Indian village Goddesses frequently have male guardian deities whose images are placed outside their shrines and who are believed to play a protective, gatekeeping role. Whitehead observed, 'In the Tamil country . . . most of them have male attendants, who are supposed to guard their shrines and carry out the commands of the goddesses; but their place is distinctly subordinate and almost servile' (1988: 18). Hiltebeitel refers to these guardian deities as 'demon devotees', and points to their association with 'Criminal gods', both of whom 'violate the sacred codes and boundaries by which other gods, and humans, would seek to live' (1990: 1). In Natal, Draupadi and Mariamman, who usually share the same temple, also share the same guardians, Madurai Veeran and Kattavarayan, the former being the more prominent and better known of the two. In India Draupadi's guardians are Muttal Ravuttan and Pottu Raja. I have spoken to a few people in Natal who have heard of Pottu Raja (or Potraj), but none who know of Muttal Ravuttan. However, Hiltebeitel records that at a temple near Madurai, outside the 'core area' of Draupadi temples in South India, one of Draupadi's bodyguards is 'Maturaiviran, the Hero of Madurai'.</page><page sequence="21">natal hindu folk goddesses 23 As his name indicates, Maturaiviran is particularly associated with the South Indian city of Madurai, where he is the guardian at the famous temple of the Goddess Minakshi. Shulman says, 'Maturaiviran is worshipped today in shrines throughout the Tamil area, often as an attendant or gatekeeper of the village goddess . . (1985: 355). Born the son of a prince, abandoned in a forest, and raised as an Untouchable, Maturaiviran seduced and married a princess. After becoming the gatekeeper of a king, he became the plundering bandit-like hero against the king's enemies. Various adventures led him to the city of Madurai where he was punished for seducing a dancing girl, who became his second wife. Recognising his guilt, he finally cut his throat and died a sacrificial death before the shrine of the Goddess Minakshi, and the king ordered the worship of Maturaiviran at the Goddess's shrine (Shulman 1985: 355-366). Images of Madurai Veeran are frequently to be found outside Mariamman temples all over Natal. At the private Mariamman festival I attended, the picture of Madurai Veeran, placed facing the Goddess, was offered cigarettes and a glass of some alcoholic drink, because, I was told, he likes them. Whitehead refers to this custom in India, and Hiltebeitel notes that Muttal Ravuttan has similar tastes (Whitehead 1988: 143, Hiltebeitel 1990: 363). Kattavarayan is also well known at South Indian folk Goddess shrines, including those of Mariamman. His name literally means 'guardian king', from the word 'Ka', 'to preserve, shelter, guard, watch' (Shulman 1990: 38). In one of the myths about him, his mother, Parvati, asked his father, Shiva, for someone to guard the beautiful garden she had created on the banks of the Ganges near Kasi (Varanasi). Through a series of complicated incidents in which he was punished by Shiva and condemned to various rebirths as an Untouchable, he embarked on a round of lawlessness and tricks, as well as exploits with women. After his violent and sacrificial death and revival, he resumed his position as gatekeeper to his Goddess mother and became the guardian of village Goddesses, especially Mariamman (and sometimes Ankalamman). Shulman's comment on the myth of Maturaiviran is equally applicable to Kattavarayan: 'Violence, freedom of action, a contempt for risks and dangerous consequences, a certain hardness of character, the abrogation of boundaries (including, in particular, sexual restrictions) - all these are part of the hero's nature' (1985: 359). The myths surrounding the folk Goddesses and their guardians abound with the theme of the violation of caste boundaries: Untouchables marrying</page><page sequence="22">24 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 Brahman women, royal princes being brought up as Untouchables. Perhaps this further reflects a need felt by many of the lower class devotees of the folk cults to become acceptable in the eyes of those of the Brahmanical tradition. Shulman points out that Kattavarayan is sometimes depicted on horseback, accompanied by his two wives, one on each side. At times, for some obscure reason, he is identified with Murukan (Muruga, Soobramonya), who is also often depicted standing between his two wives. The 'Marriamen' Temple in Pietermaritzburg has shrines to both these guardians at the gate to the temple, but here it is Madurai Veeran (Mathurave ran) who is on horseback, flanked by two wives; and I have seen this depiction of him at other Natal temples, which leads me to speculate that these two guardian figures might occasionally be confused with each other. Few people appear to know any stories associated with either figure. The Draupadiamman Temple in Cato Manor makes a very unusual departure fron this tradition by having Arjuna's son, Arava(n) (Iravan), as the guardian of Draupadi. He is a deified hero, prominent in the South Indian Draupadi cult mythology, and is represented at this temple by a painted clay head, a reminder of his severed head which apparently watched the entire eighteen day battle (Hiltebeitel 1988: 317 f.). Conclusion At present in Natal, folk worship appears to be flourishing, with larger and larger crowds attending the Goddess festivals each year. I have suggested elsewhere (Diesel 1991: 39) that ironically the isolation imposed on the Hindu Indian communities in South Africa by apartheid legislation has possibly helped in the careful preservation of these traditional ritualistic ceremonies. And, in turn, these ceremonies themselves, with their excitement, religious fervour and somewhat esoteric flavour, appear to have helped bring a strong sense of identity, stability and vitality to these minority communities. Certainly Hilda Kuper, writing in 1960, believed this to be so then. She said The persistence of Hinduism in South Africa stems partly from the local milieu itself, in which Indians are discriminated against and excluded from many of the privileges of the dominant Whites. Religion is one field in which there has been no positive interference by Whites and Hinduism provides its adherents with an identity and a security denied them in other spheres. In their religion they are not only free but equal, and not only equal but can claim superiority. (1960: 215)</page><page sequence="23">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 25 The religion of the relatively poor is particularly concerned with the provision of the very practical needs of everyday living, especially success in various enterprises, healing, and a general empowerment. People look for clear evidence of the divine in their midst. The Mother, in particular, is enormously and awesomely powerful (Sakti = power). Worship of the Mother, who controls the rains, fertility, sickness and health, and can 'possess', and protect her devotees even from burning by fire, can result in a great sense of power, and even 'superiority', in the relatively powerless (Hiltebeitel 1982: 93). One can only speculate whether the abolition of separate living areas, and the emergence of a more egalitarian society, will see the diminishing of some of these ancient practices in South Africa. This would, paradoxically, mean some real loss to the Hindu community. It is further worth noting that women obviously play a prominent and important part in the worship of these folk Goddesses in Natal, so that the question can be raised as to whether the status of women is correspondingly improved in these communities. Most commentators on the practice of Goddess worship, both past and present (e.g. Preston 198210 and Kinsley 1986) maintain that there is no positive correlation between it and the status of women, and this certainly would seem to be true of the local situation. There is, however, a possibility that the veneration of the Goddess in a culture does help women to have a somewhat higher profile in that society. Mookerjee believes that the worship of the Goddess, which has helped to glorify the female principle, has also created a greater awareness of women's power and independence (1988: 91, 92). An elderly, illiterate woman, at a firewalking festival, who volunteered what the Goddess means to her certainly expressed an extremely positive view of the role of women: 'Why are mothers more important than fathers?' she asked. 'Because they are with the children all the time; and they have good hearts. If there are troubles in the family, it's the mother's good heart that sorts these out, not the father. The fathers only give the seed, but the mothers have the children and stay with them. So you don't really need the fathers; once the children are born the mother doesn't need the father any more.' Pointing to the earth, she said, 'That is our mother - she is the ground - we get what we need from the ground, and the father has nothing to do with it. He is just up there in the sky.' (Rather dismissively.) 'Mothers are far more important than fathers.' Asked if she had children, she said, 'No, but I am still a mother, because I have a good heart. I am not married; I have given myself to the Mother (Goddess).' There is also some evidence that Goddess veneration allows a more</page><page sequence="24">26 JSR 5:2 SEPTEMBER 1992 egalitarian form of worship where class and sex differences are less emphasised. Bhardwaj points to a mingling of upper and lower caste pilgrims at Goddess shrines in India, saying, 'The cult of the goddess thus helps to link the folk and the elite . . (1973: 152), and this would appear to some extent to be happening in Natal as well. Kinsley comments on the potentially challenging aspects of the worship of Durga: . . . this beautiful young woman who slays demons seeking to be her lovers and who exists independent from male protection or guidance represents a vision of the feminine that challenges the stereotyped view of women found in traditional Hindu law books. Such a characterisation perhaps suggests the extraordinary power that is repressed in women who are forced into submissive and socially demeaning roles. In her role reversal Durga exists outside normal structures and provides a vision of reality that potentially, at least, may be refreshing and socially invigorat ing. (1986: 99) Indeed, all the folk Goddesses, with their seemingly paradoxical and indepen dent natures, break the usually accepted norms of religious experience familiar to most westerners, but it would seem that the challenge and actual confrontation of the dark, chaotic, destructive sides of life, reminders of the fragility of existence, can result in a greater ability to deal with tragedy, and so bring new strength and vitality to both individuals and the communities where they are venerated (Kinsley 1986: 211). NOTES 1. Although Brahma, one of the members of the Trimurti, has attracted hardly any worship and has almost no temples dedicated to him, his consort Sarasvati became a popular object of worship over the centu ries. 2. 'By you this universe is borne, by you this world is created. By you it is protected, O Devi and you always consume it at the end.' 3. Shulman points out that there is a widespread idea 'in South Indian village cults, that injustice - especially an unjust or premature death - can create the conditions for the worship of the now divinely powerful victim' (Shulman 1985: 361). This is also evident in the myths of the Goddess's guardians.</page><page sequence="25">NATAL HINDU FOLK GODDESSES 27 4. The sacrificing of male animals, exclusively, was also required in the Shakti worship of the Brahmanical tradition, as recorded in the Kalika Purana, c. 14th century CE - 'Let not the female, whether quadruped, or bird or woman be ever sacrificed . . (Payne 1979: 9, 10). 5. In this connection, it is interesting that the Pietermaritzburg Marriamen Temple has a picture on the wall depicting the disrobing of Draupadi. 6. Hiltebeitel also mentions a small hourglass shaped drum which is played at Draupadi festivals (called the utukkai), and this is present at local festivals. Murtis of Mariamman and Draupadi are often depicted holding one of these little drums. 7. It is interesting that 'Garbhargriha', the sanctuary in a temple which houses the main deity, literally means 'womb house'. 8. Note, too, Whitehead: 'Very often, too, the goddess is represented in processions by a brass pot filled with water and decorated with margosa leaves' (1988: 37). And Kinsley: 'Durga, then, in the form of a pot, is invoked both as the power promoting the growth of the agricultural grains and as the source of the power of life with which the gods achieved immortality' (1986: 112). 9. cf. The dot (Tilakam, Bottu) placed on the foreheads of married women to signify their potential for childbearing; and red is also the colour of wedding sarees. See Beck (1969) for further comment on the complexity of the colour red in Hindu ritual. 10. cf. Preston quoting Marina Warner: 'There is no logical equivalent in any society between exalted female objects of worship and a high position for women' (1982: 327).
