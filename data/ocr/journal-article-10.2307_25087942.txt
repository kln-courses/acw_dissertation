<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward Dabiberg St. Pragma "O Metaphysics] We are now just as advanced as in the time of the first druids." ?Voltaire A beggarly odysseus, with no Penelope or dog to greet or recognize me, I sat on the stone bench, my baccalaureate and my university learning packed in a scrip that lay at my feet. I had left one knowledge factory in northern California and come to New York. How could I foresee that St. Pragma would be a boreal text book priory? It was June 1925, no more of that can I say except I don't think such a year ever existed. Again I had sinned against my Holy Ghost. But had I, for is not one error a Jacob's Ladder to another? To the rear of me was the Augean Stable of Pragmatic Thought, as well as a statue of St. Pragma holding a polypus close to his chest. There was this inscription chiselled into the sculpture: The Seer is he who adapts himself to his age? Cicero John Dewey. Over against the Augean Stable was the School of Pecula tion, Barter, Cavil, Cheat and Cabal, where thousands of stu dents were enrolled for the study of commerce and jurispru dence. This was an august colossus deified by a statue of a huge and noble cormorant. Hard by was the Institute of Laick Copyright, 1970, by Edward Dahlberg. "St. Pragma" is from The Con fessions of Edward Dahlberg to be published in the fall of 1970 by George Braziller. 11</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review Ologies for pupils preparing for their doctorates in human association, syllogism, enthymeme, and the Aristotelian gram mar of political economy. I had studied with the venerable Anathon Aall, the eminent scholar of the doctrine of the Logos. A visiting professor from the University of Oslo, Norway, he was a sunken, damp man with the complexion of brown porridge, and a few steamy, penguid hairs on his head. He had a triangular nose which would have commanded a hecatomb to Zeus from Pythagoras. The class began at 8 o'clock of the morning y the students, wild asses, chewed the thistles of knowledge. All lubbers, they slouched in their seats, their filthy trousers rolled up to their thighs, so that Anathon Aall was ashamed to lift his eyes. While he spoke about the origin of Logos, going back to Hera clitus, the Nous of Anaxagoras, St. John, St. Paul, Clement of Alexandria, and Tatian, they snored, belched and ate cracknels. The Logos was as much of an enigma as the sphinx of Gizeh. Besides, I suffered from an obscure academic disease, gargantuism, for like Rabelais' heroic pupil, Gargantua, the more I studied the more stupid I became. Worse than that, I was always madding after a slice of onion, a shoal of black, wrinkled olives, and dried figs. Whatever I heard or studied I ate y I sucked my teeth and gums, chewed my lips, and all I had was a snack of Nous and assorted hors d'oeuvres of brute abstractions not even dressed with oil and a few lettuce leaves. Nous had to be gotten rid of. If he turned out to be a timber god I intended to chop him up, as Diagoras did the wooden Hercules, which he used for kindling to boil his turnips. One morning I made my speech: "Sir, Pm sore gravelled. Tell me, once for all, who's Nous? Is he Father-Mind seated in his vasty, gaseous pleroma excogitating innumerable planets? Who's Logos the Word? Is he the issue of the Father who enjoined Him to be the Carnal Bread and associate with a troop of bestial, warring dolts called mortals? But if God told his son, Logos, to go ahead and beget the World, why didn't he do it Himself instead of palming off the job on Demiurgus and forcing him to make Day and Night? 12</page><page sequence="3">St. Pragma "The Gnostics claim the Word never became social, spermal Bread, leaving Aether to mingle with shameless men, and that there was no embodied Messiah the people were looking for when the vernal equinox enters the sign of Aquarius. "Puzzled, but not irreverent, I don't believe Logos has the bowels of a spider, or the pericranium of a flea. And what about those felting clouds, shaped by God, the hat-maker? Are they first causes, too? "I'll never find out who framed the Universe. That's too much for the wayward mind of man. Besides, I'm starved 5 I've been chewing the Logos for two semesters. It's useless. Couldn't you relent a little just as Theophrastus who alleges that man was originally filet of sole, hake or flounder? What an appetite that gives me! O, I have an Orcus of confusions in my belly for a cucumber. Couldn't you steep fossil Nous and Logos in a barrel of brine? How can I moisten my soul? Explain how dropsical Heraclitus says a dry soul is the wisest, though he wrapped himself tip in cow-dung and was so parched he died of thirst. When a man is dying of thirst is it meta physics to say it's best to be dry. "What do I do for food? I hear that Sophia, that Primordial Chit, said to be She-Wisdom, has replaced the good-for-noth ing male gods, and that she's sensible, too, refusing to be wise unless she was furnished with that dark, velvety chink which all deities and men covet. How is it nobody knew that a plain, tiny crevice could take care of every mortal complexity? Nor did any metaphysical clod catch on to her libertine nature ; there's none so lascivious as she. There was Isis going about crazily in a wicker boat on the river Nile searching for Osiris' shameful part which she couldn't find because a scambling fish, the sea bream, got there first and devoured it. Who needs Nous when he's got Sophia and Isis? "I simply can't afford to subsist on stale clumps of episte mology and scraps of aetiology, even Pythagoras wasn't for ever bolting down theorems, cubes and triangles. He was either munching a sucking pig, a tender kid, or bent over a plate of lima beans. Let's have done with it. Allow me to sit with 13</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review Xenophanes and eat chick peas and drink sweet wine while I nibble on a peel of Isis' peplum." The students were restless, the color of Aall's nose was puce, it was 8:25. The pupils could ascertain the pigment of his nose to the minute as the Chinese were able to tell time by looking into a cat's eyes. When the damp flanks of his nose were of an emerald hue it was 9:10. Close to the hour of dismissal the wings of his nostrils were the shade of saffron. On another occasion I could not repress this query: "Pro fessor Aall, can you separate will from intellect and mind from feeling? Is venery seated near the inflammatory liver, whilst velleity can be located in the coward feet? How many metres of skin does ignorance require?" Anathon Aall gave me a pained, wry face. Then he provided me with his remote, ontological smile. "You're a naive primi tive," he said, "and you are looking for anthropomorphic gods. Do you wish the deities to have human jowls and necks?" "Why not, sir?" I replied. "Plato said the world was a great animal, and Pythagoras, of like mind, claimed it had legs, arms and feet." Aall was hardly to be the victim of a juvenile Socratic elenchus. He had furnished us with a course in divine indiffer ence, for he had locked up in his brave, dialectical heart that honeycomb, his holy Logos. A graduate course in Jamesian Platonic epistemology, with a Deweyan exegesis, was offered by Professor Montague. A classroom metaphysician, he had a three-cornered face, and parted his snowy hair clean down the middle with a laboratory knife. He had a malady described as St. Pragma dryness, and his lecture notes had long since been parched by the Dog star. I was forced to trifle out my time with the theory of Ness, that is the study of the universals deskness, tableness, chairness, houseness. As with Anathon Aall I had to fuddle my brain with Nous, Logos j now I had Ness as well. Professor Montague went to the blackboard and with a pedagogic piece of chalk listed the profane things?chair, table, 14</page><page sequence="5">St. Pragma footstool?on one side, and the holy Platonic universals? chairness, tableness, footstoolness?on the other. After sitting on my hunkers as a hare on its scut for a month I objected: "Sir, my mind is a gravid mullet though I can only bring forth Ness. Tell me, please, why is chair less angelic than chairness? Why can't we be content with earthen particulars." "We must rise above the particular to the universal," said Professor Montague, "in order to apprentice ourselves to the meditative life." "But can't you wrap Ness with summer grass, a lettuce leaf, or colewort?" I protested. "These universals give me pains in my two ears. My ankle rings, and my mouth chimes j my head's been tolling for seven hours. I just haven't the strength to raise my twinging arm and reach for chandelierness. Matter is such a grief. We live with it and die of it; it's hard, but that's our portion. It is impossible to avoid dying things. Cor rupt, we cannot perceive unless we partake of original sin. According to St. Augustine (and one of his pagan preceptors, Marcus Terentius Varro) carcass derives from the word cado, to fall. Man thinks, because he is a fallen angel. Does not Augustine imply the vanity of all philosophy when he declares that whereas Plato's flesh putrefies, the peacock's doesn't?" "A pretty whim, but scarce scientific," said Professor Monta gue. "It would be courteous to the students would you permit us to return to Ness." "Sir, please, I make full conscience of the predicament, and am not entirely confuting you." Montague arranged a philosophic smile for the benefit of the class. "Are you setting up the boundaries beyond which the Mind cannot pass?" "I've grown old and wrinkled as the cockle thinking of the Mind," I said. "Isn't it the feeblest part of the body?" Montague was about to reply when I interrupted. "I can't even get the small beer of pleasure from Ness. If I may say so, you demand we atone for villainous things by taking a cowardly flight to Ness. I adore the furniture of the Cosmos, and believe that table is more heroic than your spado, table 15</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review ness. All knowledge is corporeal, and when it deteriorates into terminology it is a pedantical dunce. Lucian tells us that pots, kettles, saucepans, ladles, were originally called Prometheus, who was the first philosopher. Anaxagoras held that man was the wisest of animals, not because he has a better sort of Nous but simply because he had hands." "Well, my boy, you've trapped yourself," crowed Monta gue. "You, too, lean on Nous." "Sir, please allow me the oil and grace of error. I was citing Anaxagoras, employing a word. Anyway, I'll cross myself before Ness if you'll provide him with hands, legs, feet and arms." "Are you serious? You insist that a chair should have a . . ." he paused, blushing. "Yes, sir, a seat and legs and the sacrum of Osiris. A study lamp has the lissom neck of Pallas and a woman the figure of an Etruscan vase." "Just to cocker your extravagant whims," Montague said, "are you claiming doors, ceilings and houses are simply differ ent sorts of animals, some male, others female? In your fro ward head I suppose a couch is a woman?" "Wasn't she made for a man to lie on? Who except a simple ton will do no more than cover her with a blanket?" "Then I suppose things?a footstool, a pebble, a marsh plant?have joys and pains." "Yea," I avowed, "all things suffer. Matter itself grieves until it is form." "Fine, excellent. Doubtless a chair is a sanguine breathing brute." "Indeed. How often when I'm tired do I need a reposeful chair. And if I'm put out with the world, and sit on that chair, it won't reproach me. When I'm forsaken, it won't let me down or borrow money from me, for it will always stand on its own legs. May I say that since Alcibiades cut off the phalloi of the gods man has not produced a single table with generative properties." "No, you may not say it." Montague set his foot down 16</page><page sequence="7">St. Pragma hard on the pedantic floor. "This is no course in the lechery of objects. Never have I heard such arrant nonsense." "Sir," I protested, "is there any other kind of sense?" I left Montague's class and attended two lectures on peda gogy, and then I cast this menstruous cloth of education down the lavatory bowl. Following this I took a semester of Behav iorism described in the catalogue as the Golden Mean of Grammar, with asides on Aristotle's Rhetoric. Sitting on the stone bench now, I recalled, best I could, scraps of eloquent orations on the rhetoric of behavior and political economy grounded on the Aristotelian Golden Mean, offered by Dr. However Pointless. Dr. Pointless was an albino. He had a nose thin as a needle and his general expression was worse than my outlook. His acute intellect was not so close a companion to him as his umbrella which he always carried into the classroom. Sometimes he used the metal edge for writing on the blackboard, forgetting it was not a piece of chalk. Again, when he was absorbed in his penetrating analysis of our glowing social organism, he would chew the cotton cloth of the umbrella and scatter the ribs on the academic floor. When the windows were open, and there was a northwesterly wind, the pieces looked like black swallows flying everywhere about the room. His lecture commenced thus: "Gentlemen, we are not con cerned with the ideal but the real, with what is, with the more or less, the less always exceeding the more. To prove it, let us example the Stagirite who says 'less evil compared with the greater becomes the good.' In short, our interest is in the preser vation of a cash society and its paying citizens. Settlements were originally planned for the quick rather than the dead. "To achieve this, men must dwell in the closest association with one another. Those who decline to associate with others are morbid dissidents, and are sub specie aeternitas, a losing proposition to the corporate nation. Let me instance the fol lowing: each commoner has his distinct social and economic position, as the rules of grammar provide ; the verb should 17</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review nuzzle the noun, the adverb (the how of the distribution of wealth) come near the dagger verb, and the adjective (the what of the results of the national resources) should take its vigilant place before the substantive. Grammatical disorder of the economy cannot be tolerated lest there be strife, riot, discord y each word, or citizen, is a logician, otherwise the words in disarray may be said to be living illegally together within the social framework of the sentence. "Money is the ineluctable consequence of social adjustment. As the Spanish poet, Quevedo, so rightly remarks, he who is out of pocket is out of this world. The pauper as well as the prodigal is the economic foe of more or less. Dismiss at the outset indolent Utopian vagaries, for we must concentrate upon the possibilities of man as a radiant, usurious animal who must perforce enjoy his fellowmen to the fullest extent. As Aristotle reminds us in the Ethicsy the lion does not take pleasure in hearing the ox, but in eating him." Dr. However Pointless now took his umbrella and pointing with it explained: "Here on one side we have excess, the wealth of the state, and on the other the deficit, the lower classes. Let it be clearly understood, those who pay lose y we shall take this up apace. Therefore only the rich man can afford to buy y whilst he is making his purchases Nature refects him, for as he spends, his interest is growing in both his pockets. The poor man can only rid himself of his character. He has nothing else to spend since it is his sole property. Obviously, the lower classes are conspicuous spendthrifts, easily tempted by witless goods, and stupid baubles, radios, automobiles, or a gloomy gallimaufry of new furniture. The easy prey of gross and specious advertisements, he is always a bankrupt. He is a giddy, ambulatory paralogism. However, whatever he buys is a loan which he receives from the rich as a token of confidence. Once he betrays this trust resulting from unemployment, a national economic panic, or stupid indigence, he then can be said to have wholly consumed himself. At this point he is like the Locrians described by an ancient as the cigalas who so devastated them selves that they had not a branch to sit upon. In all periods of 18</page><page sequence="9">St. Pragma the glowing social adventure is the amphibology of the loser, his whining shibboleths, justice, benevolence, charity, compas sion, but only the milksop believes in these dreggy words. "Everything is based upon the more or less of what was, which is what is, that is, more or less. The cause of seeming disharmony in a polity of sociable and agreeable emotions is the gluttony of the wage-earner. He ceaselessly covets his wealthy neighbor's wife, house, garden and money. He is the economic adulterer who is found in bed with the rich man's wife, and like a hungry ass who, when beaten, will not leave the pasture. "We have sufficiently proven that to be poor is to err 3 it is a moral defect in character. Therefore to pity the poor wretches in the nation is a stigma of weak-mindedness. Let us not over look the fact that the loser is an asset to the cash corporate commonality. This is Hegelian dialectics, but allow me to cite the greatest economic philosopher since Aristotle, Dr. Pangloss, who rightly observes: 'Private misfortunes are public benefits so that the more private misfortunes there are, the greater is the general good.' "Point two: There is enough condescension in the ephors of the public weal to inculcate good feelings among those who offend against the laws. As one among multifarious examples: a senseless man, starving to death, steals a loaf of bread and is arraigned in our noble areopagus. The magistrate, though austere, is not morose; instead of mentioning bread, milk, cheese, anchovies and cakes, and whetting the appetite of the hungry culprit, he nicely states that the prisoner has violated ordinance 764538. This is the majesty of the law, and the cash grace of the nation. "Once more let me emphasize that those idealistic theorists who prate of justice, and the equitable distribution of goods are economic diviners who are basting a bawd in a chancel. At the risk of being repetitious I must needs assert that those who purchase what they cannot afford are no better than a parcel of cuckolds. Let me illustrate further: The grubby pleb can not wait until he has received his Saturday night's wages. The 19</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review money, not yet in his hand, teases and tickles his skin, itches and burns like a raw scab that he deliriously wishes to remove when he espies in a cheap showcase a washing machine his slut of a wife can well do without. He gapes until he is wounded with joy; his pain becrazes him and he's furious and intractable as if he were having carnal commerce with a round, delicious tart. This excruciating throb is at the same time an intolerable pleasure. See how Euripides expresses the ecstasy of pain: the wound of Telephus, he says, was 'Soothed by the filings ground from the same spear.' The rabble will stick at nothing to get a parasitic toy; to quote Sallust, it is 'the Commons' . . . inherent disposition to novelties.' "To spend is the main recreation of the petit-bourgeois workman; as Aristotle holds, the worker's mind is 'cheated into a persuasion.' Only the rich are frugal, content as Diogenes with a dilapidated leek, a sprat, some antique greens, the relic of a potato in the shape of one of St. Francis' ankles deposited at Tours. The Cato of the Commonweal, the rich man abides by Cicero's exhortation: 'Unguents with an earthly taste are better than the flavor of saffron.' "To conclude our dissertation for the day: The basis of society is sacred robbery, or the subtlest craft of the imperial transaction. Likewise, guile and plunder are the holy writ of the nation. Truth, under all conditions, is a scourge, an economic anachronism. Were there no hypocrites everybody would be worn out before they were eighteen years of age." Needless to say, I was so entranced with the Professor's style of delivery I never interrupted him. Nor did I ever for get the political economy of more or less, or his golden maxim, that the worse is the better because it isn't really that bad. Still sitting in St. Pragma's quadrangle, I bent over to caress my scrip bulging with Nous, Ness and More or Less. My mind, weakened by so many strange reveries, was hard to bring to a stop. In a little while I saw the image of Father Cornelius Clifford, a Jesuit priest who gave a weekly seminar on the primitive church fathers. Father Clifford had a thin, 20</page><page sequence="11">St. Pragma humble parish at Whippany, New Jersey. A most eminent scholar of St. Augustine, he once opened his heart to me, confiding that there was no advancement in the church for a learned man. He was the familiar of Lord Balfour, the states man who had written the most pessimistic book on philosophy I had read, Henri Bergson, and a whole galaxy of metaphysi cians now extinct. He had Celtic eyes, the hue of an Iberian sky, his head was covered with heavy, albic down and his rosy cheeks were washed in the blood of the Paschal Lamb. Under Father Clifford's tutelage I misread bits of Origen, Sts. Anselm, Boniface, Thomas Aquinas and Augustine. How ever, it is better to misunderstand profound works than to comprehend trash. Little do I recall of his easy, informal divagations. A military Jesuit, he inveighed against the mea cock pacifism of Bertrand Russell. I would wait to accompany him at the close of the class and as the elevator rose to our floor, before stepping into it, it was his wont to say: "May it please God that we avoid foul Styx as we descend." That I recollect well nigh nothing is not to be scorned; it may be that if we study, what we forget is what we remember. Then, our bodies seldom fail us; no one should do what his anatomy forbids him to try. We are automatic, or far more so than otherwise, declared Pascal. In the twenty-fourth year of my rugged and barren life, I rummaged in the annals of Clement of Alexandria, Tatian, St. Jerome, and Eusebius. I lipped with psalmodie awe Clem ent's The Stromata and Augustine's The City of God. To repeat, this was a mumble to me, but character rules the morning, twilight and the dusk, and no man may deprive himself of his portion. To misunderstand what one is doing is also to learn, and as it had to be I could only cry, "My cup runneth over with self-delusion." One afternoon Father Clifford gave a lecture on Augustine's Confessions at the mansion of Clarence Mackay, the president of Postal Telegraph. The priest, my sole companion of those blighted days, informed me that were Mackay to know that a Jew was under his roof, he would scarce deem it a venial sin 21</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review on his part. Chance is a wily god, for his daughter was to elope with Irving Berlin, the Jewish Tin Pan Alley composer of "Alexander's Ragtime Band." With the exception of Rabbi Martin of San Francisco and Father Clifford, I never had much palate for the deceit of the clerical cloth. When I was thirty, and on my way to visit Al fred Stieglitz at An American Place, an aged man shambled along Madison Avenue and I thought he paused. His footsteps were flaccid, his eyes dim, parched violets, his cheeks lapt in their final sunset. It was Father Clifford. "My son," he said, "are you successful?" I lowered my eyes. "Father," I replied, "I have published a book, and have drunk the water of gall, Marah" In a small while I heard that Father Clifford had died. He was the one warm mammal, the Lord's Elect, the Thinking Lamb of St. Pragma. 1 attended one of John Dewey's mums and nasal mono tones, and quit. I endured a year of Middle English with Professor Krapp. Betimes I discovered I could "kembe and karde" the glossary of The Canterbury Tales and that stum bling in the Wyf of Bath afforded me the flesh and charity not in this pedagogue. I took a frowsy course with John Erskine in Shakespeare; he was the campus voice, and had received his doctorate in pre-Elizabethan literature in order afterwards to scamp a cogging, The Private Life of Helen of Troy. Erskine demanded that the student throw down his craw a Shakespearean play a day. Soon I absented myself from class for nearly the entire semester. At the close of it, I came to him, and looking woeful and sick?no hardship for me?said the doctor had prescribed as many pellets for me as there were colors in the coat of Joseph. Professor Erskine cared not for my figure of speech and beshrewed me, refusing to let me take the final examination. So I left Hamlet, the sonnets, Lear, and Timon of Athens, lest I fail them. In Paris in 1929 I was strolling along the rue de l'op?ra when I saw a forlorn figure endeavoring to catch my notice. It was John Erskine. Both our books, Bottom Dogs and The 22</page><page sequence="13">St. Pragma Private Life of Helen of Troy} not yet published, were on G. P. Putnam's list. Seldom have I scorned a man's need of me and given him my wrathful back. I suppose my back then had as many angry eyes as Argus. Randolph Bourne, the iconoclastic hunchback from Plain field, New Jersey, has painted Erskine as the "pale Gideon" in The History of a Literary Radical. Bourne had been the disciple of Dewey, had accompanied the pragmatist to Italy and later attacked him because he was an advocate of the first world war. Bourne's portrait of Dewey's caitiff conceptions are in "Twilight of the Idols," included in the volume, Untimely Papers. "War is the health of the state," said Bourne. Who will gainsay him? Randolph Bourne is still cemeteried. How many even know his name? The literary merchants are hawking that pocky farce of six foot five, Thomas Wolfe, or the shallow pate, Fitzgerald. They give the dead spurious succor, while silence is the pusil lanimous epitaph of that gallant hero, Randolph Bourne. Meanwhile I studied Theodor Gomperz' Greek Think ersy the fragments of Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Par menides, Heraclitus and Empedocles. I did not ever presume to waylay an epical author, or battle Lucretius, Horace, Lucian as though I were Hannibal ravaging Italy. Ignatius Loyola says that a pupil should be a corpse in the hands of a teacher. No rabble pedant can comprehend this sort of imperial passivity. He who goes to an Homeric book to annihilate it is a pack of shames, and this is so-called demo cratic education. As for me, give me an onion of Propertius, a bunch of watercress of Euripides, and the English of Dekker's Plague PamphletSy and I am ready for the hectoring battle. Read as if the casket were ever near, and then you may under stand the Iliads. Bear in mind, one is always an experienced reader. Dryden averred that he studied the scholiast, Macro bius, in order to discover miraculous lines in one ancient author or another, which he had slubbered over or not seen. The motive of the book-slayer is the fear of being less than 23</page><page sequence="14">The Massachusetts Review the author. I never shunned the influence of a thinker. My constellation is Sagittarius, Contemplation, as Giordano Bruno said; for I am the bones and dust of Ovid, Horace, Plotinus and Thucydides. My viaticum was always the bookey and I studied until my face was a pallid winding-sheet. Oftentimes I resembled a meatless day or weeks, or Chrysippus, of whom John Lily relates: "What scholar is he that is so zealous of his book as Chrysippus, who had not his maid Melissa thrust meat into his mouth, had perished with famine, being always study ing?" Still, I bedded the wisest books and profited nothing. We do not know what we gain, and no man ever loses one experi ence or emotion. How Ovid's The Metamorphosis has grown and ripened since I've aged. "Good things never appear in their full beauty till they turn their backs and be going away," says Francis Bacon. The students at St. Pragma were no less aloof and spectral than the pedagogue. Nobody pestered me, which was a great nuisance. What companions had Prometheus save the elements? Then and now I could envisage no other course except to be trimmed, shaved, polled, and divided as if I were Christ's gar ment* Was the alternative, assuming one had any, to be a man of genius or to be average? The mediocre squanders his brief eructations beneath the stars. I walked alone. Go then to Parnassus, ye who long for nothing. Had st. pragma undone me? I sat alone on the stone bench, wasting and limbecking my brain. When I pushed my foot against my gulligut scrip filled with Nous, Logos, Ness, and More or Less, I fainted with nausea and rushed to the closest pharmacy. "What's wrong?" said the chemist in dismay. My complex ion was corrupt as gangrene. "Sir, I just gave up Ness, and I think Sophia too. What do you think I've got. Will I die of it?" "Don't worry," he reassured me. "You've been dying all your life." 24</page><page sequence="15">St. Pragma "But what can one take for such a mortal sickness as life?" I asked. "Swallow eight grams of liquid nitre, with calcined charcoal, and lixivium," he advised. "I forgot to tell you a bed bug sucked up a pint of my blood a week ago, when my mind was on More or Less." "You're suffering from college anemia. Cook a pot of len tils, with cathantic said to have been used by the ancient Egyptians for embalming." "Then, too," I said, "I sit too much. It's very hard on virtue." "Three scruples of the powdered pounce of a nightingale, with eleven drams of hellebore, and a tablespoon of lyssol should relieve you of that complaint. Be sure to avoid all sly lecherous conceptions that might involuntarily creep into your head." "Then I had a fit of vanity," I confessed. "My real name is Absalom." "That's bad," said the chemist. "Not even humility will cure you." "What do I do for bedlam miseries, long uninterrupted aches of insanity?" "I would advise you to avoid anybody who considers him self sensible." "But why is it," I persisted, "I don't have my mind on any thing." "You think too much." "Hmm. I never thought of that. Is there a remedy for stiff ness of the brain? The other night my wit took ill." And with this, I groaned. "For God's sake, man, what is the matter?" said the sym pathetic chemist. "My bowels." "What's the trouble with your bowels?" "Though I stand still, they move. Then there's my in somnia." "Sleep will fix you up. It never fails." 25</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review After paying the chemist all my gramercies for his goodness I stood outside his shop for a while. An old man loaded with something very heavy came by. Minded to help him, as I drew closer I saw he was carrying himself. "That's a heavy load," I grieved. He had a long, slack paunch that he held in his hands. Noticing my pitying glance, he spoke: "Gentleman, any old bottles, newspapers? A suit hanging in the closet is worse than a sorrow or debt hanging around one's neck." When I did not reply, for I was collecting a pile of unfinished medita tions, he persisted: "Do you have a dozen or so of used shoes, or years of gone socks with not too many holes, rusty under wear? I pay spot cash." Younger than I supposed, he was fingering the lapel of my jacket. I was already obliged to him; bowing, I requested that he come upstairs to my monastic kennel in the St. Pragma dor mitory, and promised him he could take whatever was in my wardrobe I was not using. "Good boy," he said. "I can see you're highly educated. One doesn't come across such politeness in these rude times. It is an honor to meet you. My name is Samuel Kindly. Really a privi lege to meet a diploma man." Overcome, he wiped his eyes, and more gingerly rubbed the palm of his hand against the wool of my coat. His color changed a little; still, he accompanied me, although he was not so overflowing and I missed his compliments sorely. With rectitude he bent down and examined the frayed cuffs of my trousers. "Who beat your pants?" he moaned. He put the best face on this he could, and laughing unnaturally con tinued: "I guess your trousers are like a well-read book, hun gry and worn to the thread. But I could sell the pants for a quarter. Throw in the jacket and I'll make it thirty-five cents." Reaching my room I opened the door to the clothes closet. "Here's a pillow-case full of two left-over sour summers," I said. "I nearly forgot; there's a brand new month of June I hardly wore?too wet and changeable. June makes me quite nervous; by the time it's gone, I never needed it." I crawled under the bed and tossed out some shirt tails and 26</page><page sequence="17">St. Pragma several unlaundered collars of heavy disappointing hours that had had a bad effect on my health. Then catching a glimpse of the ragpicker, who looked bewildered and slightly hostile, I took his hand in mine. He stepped back showing contempt. Not minded to be offended, for I had so much desire to do something for this good man, I said: "I see last autumn. Rather frowsy, but it's yours. Unless I'm mistaken there ought to be two hundred pounds of indifference beneath my mattress. My back's been troubling me of late and I like to sleep on some thing hard." I lifted the mattress, and the ragpicker scrutinized it and me. "I may have left the metal with the dormitory porter," I explained. "Do you see cruelty and hardness of heart there with my stickpin and cuff buttons?" The ragpicker was standing cold and erect. "Mister," he said, "my time isn't exactly yours. I'm in a hurry." Not hearing, as one always grasps what one has not listened to, I remarked: "One afternoon, I couldn't find myself. I re peated my name, stopped every passer-by and requested, 'Please, sir, do you happen to know where Mr. Anybody's Miserable Chagrin lives?' What a relief it is to be lost when I'm particularly weary of myself, for who can endure speaking to the same person every livelong day, getting the usual trite replies. I'm just tidying up an unfinished incident I didn't know how to handle two years ago. When I don't know what to do with myself I suck buttons; that helps me out of some heavy ill; sucking buttons is far better than licking spittle. On occasion when the ghost of an evil deed is closely hovering over me, I reverently tiptoe to the bureau drawer where I keep my treasures, my mother's letters, and all my anguishes, espe cially my regrets, and I pick up each one and fondle it. I hard ly have a pain, a conscience for a bad act I once committed that is not as old as I am. No matter how long ago I had a remorse it still hurts and stings and is so feverish. Odd, one cannot hold on to pleasure but pain stays with you until it has given up its last breath. Then, too, one never loses a single emotion. What ever I am saying at this moment happened long ago." 27</page><page sequence="18">The Massachusetts Review I looked up and around me. The ragpicker was gone. I sat down in a chair, my eyes bleary, and muttered: "Why is it that nothing has ever happened to me?" I was certain he had never been there. 1HAD no vocation and I was not likely ever to doze over the crocuses and hyacinths of lucre. So I taught high school for a year, and tutored a few pupils in French when I was free. Under my direction girls and boys of twelve and thirteen read Gorki's Creatures Who Once Were Meny Gogol's The Cloaky Chekhov's Tales, Turgenev's The Diary of a Sportsman, George Gissing's The Private Papers of Henry Roycrofty and Abbe Prevost's Manon Lescaut. One of these April darlings I saw years afterwards; she had become a news logician for a New York newspaper. She was all money and no Helen. Ovid says the olives and white pop lars and willows turn round their leaves at the solstice. Could I have been a wise olive I too would have waited to be turned around as the seasons listeth. Instead I went to Paris. 28</page></plain_text>
