<plain_text><page sequence="1">Form Follows Nature: The Origins of American Organic Architecture Mark Mumford is an assistant profes- sor of architecture at Iowa State Univer- sity. For nineteenth-century American architects and theorists who sought a modern aes- thetic, nature provided the only sound philosophy. Ask the fact for te form, Emerson wrote, confident that nature would instruct and inspire the artist to create. In making the work of art, Emerson insisted that the artist proceed like nature in her productions. But the work of art could not imitate nature directly. The artist had to formulate a method of composition paral- leling nature's, translating the process of life, growth and development in abstract form. Frank Furness and Louis Sullivan ap- plied the organic principle to artistic com- position. They were founders of the or- ganic tradition in American Architecture, part of a larger intellectual and artistic movement which originated in the philoso- phy of Emerson, and developed in the writing of Thoreau, Whitman, Hawthorne and Melville, and in the painting of the Hudson River School. Although the tran- scendental philosophy of nature was the intellectual basis for American organic architecture, the artistic concept was de- rived from European sources. This paper explores the influence of European aes- thetic theory, particularly the theories of the French "Romantiques," in the develop- ment of American organic architecture. It analyzes the work of Fumess and Sullivan to find their methods of design and how they applied American and French ideas to architectural composition. Frank Furness, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright were founders of the Ameri- can organic tradition in architecture.1 Furness, Sullivan and Wright are linked chronologically -Sullivan was an ap- prentice in Furness' office and Wright was Sullivan's greatest disciple -but histori- ans have not been able to define their work in terms of the organic tradition. In general, the organic principle remains relatively undeveloped in the scholarship of architecture. This paper analyzes and compares the work of Frank Furness and Louis Sullivan, in order to develop a defi- nition of American organic architecture which is not dependent on stylistic criteria. Although Furness, Sullivan and Wright produced buildings over a span of more than one hundred years, the chronologi- cal distance and stylistic differences of their architecture should not obscure the fact that their work was based on essen- tially the same principle. The organic theories which these men formulated were complex and this complexity must be taken into account. In fact, Sullivan's and Wright's writing and architecture present contradic- tions which might seem to undermine the integrity of their own organic theories. However, before these complexities can be understood and resolved, a common ground must be established as a starting point for further study. My argument as- serts that an organic tradition exists in the work of Furness, Sullivan and Wright, and that this architecture is based on a funda- mental aesthetic theory. Frank Furness 11 839-1912) was born into a prominent Philadelphia family.2 His fa- ther, the Rev. William Henry Furness, Sr., a Unitarian minister, was a respected intellectual and a theological scholar. A student of William Ellery Channing and an intimate friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson, William Furness was one of the principal formulators of American transcendental philosophy. Taught by his father, Frank Furness' mind and character were formed by the transcendental idea. His thinking about architecture was also fundamentally influenced by Emerson's organic concept. Louis Sullivan's (1856-1924) philosophy of architecture was also based on tran- scendental thinking.3 He read Emerson deeply. Like Emerson, he believed that nature was the elemental source of artistic inspiration.4 Emerson's great disciple, Walt Whitman, was Sullivan's spiritual teacher. Whitman was an ideal creator who com- bined nature and humanity into a subtle unison, Sullivan wrote admiringly. He blended the soul harmoniously with mate- rials. He mastered nature's methods, and developed his ideas organically. Whitman's literary style grew spontane- ously, Sullivan believed, in a manner simi- lar to nature's process of creation. Sullivan saw himself as Whitman's counterpart, "one of the gifted ones whose souls are finely attuned to the touching beauty of nature and humanity."5 Emerson and the transcendentalists urged American artists and writers to renovate culture, to invent a new art, new literature and new philosophy which expressed the American character. He advised the artist to seek inspiration in nature. If the artist were sufficiently receptive, nature would speak to the sensitive ear. For one who possessed a quick imagination and a natural sympathy, nature offered a system of forms and a method of creation directly applicable to art. Motivated by Emerson, Horatio Greenough proposed an aesthetic theory based on the close study of nature. He observed plant and animal structures in order to define the "great principles of construction." Greenough wrote: "If, as the first step in our search after the great principles of construction, we but observe the skeletons and skins of ani- mals, ... are we not as forcibly struck by their variety as by their beauty? There is no arbitrary law of proportion, no unbending model of form. There is scarce a partof the animal organization which we do not find elongate or shortened, increased, dimin- ished, or suppressed, as the wants of the genus or species dictate, as their exposure or their work may require.... "The law of adaptation is the fundamental law of nature in all structures. So unflinch- ingly does she modify a type in accor- dance with a new position, ... so entirely does she limit the modification to the demands of necessity, . . ."6 To be organic, Greenough concluded, architecture must also conform to this law. Impressed by Greenough's idea, Emerson directed the artist to seek the relationship between form and function in nature and apply the principle to art. He wrote in his essay on "Beauty": "Arising out of eternal Reason, one and perfect, whatever is beautiful rests on the foundation of the necessary. Nothing is ar- bitrary, nothing is insulated in beauty. It depends forever on the necessary and the useful. Fitness is so inseparable an accom- paniment of beauty that it has been taken for it.'7 Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="2">U The transcendental concept of organic form was based on English and German aesthetic theory.8 Among English writers, Samuel Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle were most influential in shaping transcen- dentalist thinking. Coleridge wrote in a manner similar to Greenough and Emer- son: "The organic form...is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form. Such is the life, such the form. Na- ture, the prime genial artist inexhaustible in diverse powers, is equally inexhaustible in forms."9 German theorists also proposed an or- ganic concept which closely paralleled the ideas of Coleridge, Carlyle, Emerson and Greenough. The German architect Gottfried Semper formulated a concept of architecture which echoed Greenough's. Semper wrote: "The theory of building will lead to the reali- zation that in the same way that nature, for all her abundance, is thrifty in her motifs, in the same way that she modifies the few basic forms or principles a thousandfold according to the evolutionary stage reached by living beings...according to their var- ied living conditions...architecture too is based on a few standard forms and prin- ciples, which through constant reappear- ance make possible infinite variations that are conditioned by the particular need of each case...."0 Emerson read the works of the German Romantics, as did William Henry Furness, who was a prolific translator of German literature and philosophy.1 Through Emerson and the elder Furness, it is likely that Frank Furness also knew the German Romantic theories. Emerson's philosophy of Nature was fun- damental in forming American literature, art and architecture. However, the tran- scendentalists did not produce a coherent aesthetic theory which was directly appli- cable to architecture. Artistic composition did not come spontaneously from nature, as Emerson insisted it must. The imagina- tion may conceive a new reality, but the artist has to somehow convert thought into form by molding the materials of art. The transcendentalists failed to provide a means for converting aesthetic theory to artistic form. German theory was more influen- tial. During the 1880s the writings of Schinkel and Semper were translated by a number of Americans including John Wellborn Root, Sullivan's contemporary in Chicago.12 However, even more impor- tant in the development of American or- ganic architecture were the theories of the rench 'Romantiques" at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Frank Furness studied architecture between 1859 and 1861 in the atelier of Richard Morris Hunt (1828-1895). Hunt, the first American architect trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, studied in the atelier of Hector-Martin Lefuel between 1846 and 1854.13 In 1855 he returned to America, and established himself among the lead- ing architects in New York. In 1857 Hunt formed an atelier based on the French school. Two years later Furness entered Hunt's studio. He joined fellow students Henry Van Brunt, Charles Dexter Gam- brill, Edmund Quincy, George Post and William Ware. While Hunt was at the Ecole, a great ideo- logical ferment revolutionized the school. The group of 'Romantique" theorists chal- lenged the academic system and the prin- ciples of classicism which the Ecole held as immutable and universal. They found the classical forms and philosophy had become indurate and unadaptable to the progress of history. The "Romantiques' sought essential principles of composition on the basis of which to found a new architecture. They sought an architecture which was unconstrained by arbitrary sty- listic conventions; an architecture based on science and rational principles.14 To discover these principles, the "Roman- tiques" studied scientifically and analyzed rationally Greek, Gothic, Byzantine, Ro- manesque and other historical models. In their studies of history, the French theorists differentiated architectural styles accord- ing to structural properties. Eugene-Em- manuel Viollet-le-Duc admired the logic of Greek architecture. He found that "the Orders of architecture invented by the Greeks are the very structure itself...." Viollet-le-Duc also conducted extensive studies of Gothic architecture, and found that similar to the Greek, the Gothic was based absolutely on "reasoning." The medieval builders had a thoroughly ra- tional predisposition of mind. Their work is beautiful because, Viollet-le-Duc wrote, "...real beauty can only be obtained when developed in accordance with laws based upon reason. Every absolutely beautiful work must be the development of a rigor- ously logical principle."'5 The "Romantiques" proposed a theory of architecture based on organic principles. They were influenced by revolutionary con- cepts emerging from the natural sciences. Similar to the way biologists classified the various species of living organisms on the basis of structural resemblances and differ- ences, French architects differentiated build- ings by type. Each type was considered a distinct organism which evolved through a series of phyla throughout history. In na- ture, every organism evolved according to the law of functional adaptations, and building types developed similarly. Using scientific analyses, French theorists sought to define the essential relationship be- tween function and structure in architec- ture.16 The form-function relationship was funda- mental in French theory. The "Romantiques" maintained, as Leonce Reynaud wrote: "In everything that has resulted from God's hand there exists an intimate relationship between form and function; the exterior is the result of the internal composition... similarly, architecture demands that its forms be the result, the product of its destination ... admitting nothing that is not founded on real necessity."17 Viollet-le-Duc urged the architect to apply "the natural principles of creation," similar to medieval sculptors who studied plants and animals in order to understand how their forms 'always express a function or submit themselves to the necessities of the organism." In the same way, medieval Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="3">masons "sought to bring out in the struc- tures of their 6uildinqs those qualities they found in vegetation. '8 Viollet-le-Duc main- tained that the relationship between func- tion and structure was fundamental in medieval architecture, and should be the guiding principle for the modern artist. Influenced by Emersonian philosophy, Hunt and his students combined French "Ro- mantique" theory with American transcen- dental thinking. In 1861, while a student in Hunt's atelier, Henry Van Brunt wrote a series of articles for The Atlantic Monthly, titled "Greek Lines," which provide an invaluable insight into how Hunt and his students interpreted the French theory.'9 like a follower of Emerson, Van Brunt opened his essay with a panegyric of Art and Nature. The first lesson which the artist must learn is that which Nature taught, Van Brunt declared. Similar to the tran- scendentalists, he maintained that prin- ciples of beauty could only be derived from nature. "...out of flowers and trees, earth and sky, ...creeps into our spirits ... the principle of Beauty, ... [which] pervades all material objects, all motions and sounds in Nature, "...we do not suspect how these manifesta- tions of material Beauty are received by the mysterious alembic of the soul, - how they are worked up there by exquisite and subtle processes of moral chemistry, hu- manized, spiritualized, ...Wedo not know how [nature]...enter[s] into the heart, become[s] ideal, mingle[s] with human emotions, ..."20 This was the most difficult question which confronted the artist: how can the forms and principles of nature be applied to painting, poetry, music and architecture? Influenced by the French 'Romantiques," Van Brunt turned to Greek art as the ideal model. The Greeks produced an organic art, but not by copying nature directly. "Nature poured out at the feet of the Greek artist a most plenteous offering, and the lap of Flora overflowed for him with tempt- ing garlands of Beauty; but he did not gather these up with any greedy and indiscriminate hand....he considered se- renely what were his needs for decora- tion, took lovingly a few of the most ordi- nary forms, and, studying the creative sentiment of them, ...applied them to the work of illustrating his grand Ideal. These leaves and flowers were selected not for their own sake, though he felt them to be beautiful, but for the decorative motive they suggested, the humanity that was in them, and the harmony they had with the emergencies of his design. The design was not bent to accommodate them, but they were translated and lifted up into the sphere of art.' The Greek artist converted nature to ab- stract form. 'Abstract lines are the most concentrated expressions of human ideas.... Distinct from the common language of Art, which contents itself with conveying merely local and individual ideas, abstract lines are recognized as the grand hieroglyphic symbolism of the aggregate of human thought.... The natural world, passing through the mind of man, is immediately interpreted and humanized by this crea- tive power, and assumes the colors, forms, and harmonies of Painting, Sculpture, and Music. But abstract lines, as we find them in Architecture...are the independent de- velopments of this creative power, coming directly from humanity itself..... Thus it is an inevitable deduction that Architecture is the most human of all arts, and its lines the most human of all lines."21 Van Brunt claimed that abstract lines were "the immediate source of the emotion, ... presenting it palpably to the senses...by an instinctive and universal symbolism... Hence came those lines which aesthetic writers term 'lines of beauty,' ...animated with life and thought and musical motion ... These lines "are understood to be exponential of certain phases of our own existence....' These symbolic expressions are based upon the 'vast organic harmo- nies of Nature." Such abstract lines are the "symbol[s] of the productive power in Nature ...that great life-giving principle..."22 A number of English theorists, closely asso- ciated with the French 'Romantiques," also contributed to the development of the organic concept. Perhaps the most influen- tial of the English theorists was Christo- pher Dresser. Dresser's books, The Art of Decorative Design (1862) and Principles of Decorative Design (1873), and essays were widely read by American architects. In 1876 Dresser was invited to lecture at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. These lectures on "Art Industries," "Art Museums," and "Art Schools" were pub- lished in Philadelphia's Penn Monthly in 1877.23 Dresser maintained that architectural and decorative compositions must be based on geometric principles derived from na- ture. By observing plants, Dresser wrote, the artist can "deduce from their habits and mode of growth laws which shall govern the production and arrangement of forms." Dresser observed that plants and animals grow and move, and thus express their life in their forms. He showed how growth and movement are expressed by a "line of life," which was essential in all artistic forms, enlivened by a property which Dresser defined as vital tension. Energy counters resistance, Dresser noted. As plants grow and as animals move, they must resist the forces of gravity, wind, water and soil. Resistance and counter- force create a deformity, which, Dresser pointed out, is the visible result of forces acting on the body. Density, weight, resis- tance, flexibility, plasticity, and rigidity can all be abstractly expressed geometri- cally. The effects of pressures on bodies ... should be most carefully and constantly considered," Dresser wrote. "The influence of matter in motion ... is at all times worthy of study, for by observing the aspects of matter when acted upon by various influences, and diligently inquir- ing into the nature of the mental concep- tion of facts and occurrences, it will be found possible to express feelings and ideas by ornaments without the use of symbolic forms. 'Plants not only manifest certain forms and combinations of lines and colors, but they set forth a principle of life and energy, Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="4">U9 Dresser also wrote. By abstracting these qualities of life and energetic movement, the artist can design ornamental forms which express feelings and ideas. 'I have sought to embody chiefly the one idea of power, energy, force and vigour, as a dominant idea, and in order to do this, I have employed such lines as we see in the bursting buds of spring, when the energy of growth is at its maximum... and I have also availed myself of those forms which we see in certain bones of birds which are associated with the organs of flight, and which give us an impression of great power.'24 Dresser's organic theory was in many ways similar to that of C6sar Daly. Both defined expression in art based on the perception of motion in organic forms. A similar concept was developed by the French theorist Victor Marie Charles Rup- rich-Robert. He dissected plants and ana- lyzed animal structures to find the essential principles of their construction and the basis for organic expression. To define the vital geometries of natural forms, Rup- rich-Robert treated organic structures ab- stractly. "The genius of man [is to] simplify, or amplify, in a word modify, those elements which he has under his eyes, and giving to each . . . new expressions corresponding to the ideas that he wishes to express."2 Among Americans, the most important to develop an organic aesthetic theory was Leopold Eidlitz (1823-1908).26 Eidlitz was closely associated with Hunt. Both men were instrumental in the founding of the American Institute of Architects. With Hunt, Eidlitz was a central figure in New York's artistic and intellectual society. While in Hunt's atelier, Frank Furness and the other apprentices also took part in this group. In the 1 850s and early 1 860s, Eidlitz pub- lished a number of articles in The Crayon in which he explored the connections between French, German, English and American aesthetic thinking. These articles became the basis for Eidlitz's book, pub- lished in 1881, The Nature and Function of Art More Specifically of Architecture.27 Born in Prague in 1823, and educated at the Vienna Polytechnic, Eidlitz was very familiar with the writings of the German Romantic theorists. He was interested in transcendental philosophy, and he read Ruskin and the English theorists. Eidlitz's aesthetic thinking developed out of the broad syncretism of German, American, English and French theory. In the manner of Emerson and the transcen- dentalists, Eidlitz suggested that the archi- tect study nature. He must imitate the prin- ciples of natural structures. By studying the constructional forms' of organic structures, Eidlitz explored how natural organisms 'express functions fully and directly in obe- dience to natural laws." Similar to the French theorists, he defined artistic expres- sion in terms of forces acting through the structure of a composition.2 Expression in architecture, Eidlitz reasoned, is based on the conflict between gravity and rigidity. Such expression depends on the resolution of physical pressures acting within the architectural body. Eidlitz illus- trated this principle by citing similar effects in organic forms: "The exact nature of the... [experience] of works of nature or of fine art may be described as follows: Natural organisms, ... are alive with growth or motion; they visibly express the functions performed by them.... 'In this way they convey to the mind an expression of these functions, and thus they tell the story of their being. The archi- tect, in imitation of this natural condition of matter, so models his forms that they also tell the story of their functions . . . Eidlitz used the human body as an anal- ogy for architecture. He pointed out that emotions are expressed physically 'by modifications of the human form.' 'We find in nature that the human frame does mechanical work, sometimes with the labor of the carrier of burdens, and then again with the ease of an athlete. It is these gradations of ease, grace, direct- ness, and expression with which labor is performed, or with which mechanical work is done by the human frame, which fur- nishes to the architect the elements of art expression in his structure.'29 Eidlitz's definition of expression in art was similar to Dresser's concept. His thinking also followed closely the French theorists such as C6sar Daly who sought a relation- ship between artistic forms and what he ca led 'the aesthetic sensibilities of man.' Daly believed that "at the base of human instincts exists the conscience of a permanent symbolic rela- tion between, on the one hand, certain considerations of lines, and, on the other hand, the static and dynamic conditions of bodies.' 'Plastic art is nothing but a language by which men express their ideas and their sentiments.... [architecture, painting and sculpture] are symbols... of the soul.... The plastic arts constitute a language analo- gous to mimicry; ... [they] address them- selves to the sense of sight and the only elements which they employ are form and color. '30 In human beings, gestures spontaneously express the psychological condition of the person making them. The artist abstracts these gestures from the momentary situ- ation and the mind which engenders them. Abstracted from the emotion or event, in a work of art, gesture becomes a symbolic form. Eidlitz explained: 'Plastic art deals with the human figure, and depicts it in a state of animation at the moment when it expresses the emotion by which the artist illustrates an idea.'31 There are 'structural" relationships between the configuration of architectural composi- tion and its expressive content, Eidlitz wrote, which are realized intuitively, empathically. When viewing a work of architecture, we realize the forces and pressures which act in the structure directly in terms of our own bodily experience. The forces exerted within the column are felt as though they were acting within us. We feel the compressive pressures which bear on a column or the springing force as it lifts its load. The column becomes a living form Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="5">Ub and its life becomes a metaphor for our own. Fundamentally, the organic concept was an extension of the ancient associations between architectural and human forms. Since Vitruvius, theorists had connected the Classical Orders with human qualities and based the classical systems of propor- tions on human measure. However, the "Romantique' concept surpassed the clas- sical idea of proportional correspondence in which the ratios of human proportions were used in the structure of architectural composition. Nineteenth-century theorists conceived the relationship between archi- tectural and human form not in terms of model, but of metaphor. "A metaphor," Geoffrey Scott has explained, "is by definition, the transcription of one thing into terms of another, and this in fact is what the theory [of classicism] ... claims. It claims that architectural art is the tran- scription of the body's state into forms of building. In his book The Architecture of Humanism (1914), Scott defined the fundamental principle of nineteenth-century classicism: "Architecture, simply and immediately per- ceived, is a combination, ... of spaces, of masses and of lines. These few elements make the core of architectural experi- erice.... 'And these appearances are related to hu- man functions. Through these spaces we can conceive ourselves to move; these masses are capable, like ourselves, of pressure and resistance; these lines, should we follow or describe them, might be our path and our gesture.... 'This is the humanism of architecture. The tendency to project the image of our func- tions into concrete forms is the basis, for architecture.... 'Weight, pressure and resistance are part of our habitual body experience, and our unconscious mimetic instinct impels us to identify ourselves with apparent weight, pressure, and resistance exhibited in the forms we see.... 32 The 'Romantiques' conceived of building as an organic unity. Architectural volumes were likened to the organs which form the animal body. Just as the living creature is composed of organs fitted compactly and adjusted to function together, the building's spatial volumes were fitted closely together, compressed and interlocked in a compact geometric physiognomy. The structure which contains the building volumes was likened to a skeletal frame which supports the organs of the living organisms. Finally, the building structure was sheathed in a skin of masonry which reveals the inner form of the structural organism.33 The structural frame not only holds the building physically, it is the source of organic expression. The 'Romantiques' proposed a revolutionary concept of artis- tic expression which was independent of stylistic association. Architectural expres- sion is based on direct experience. Mean- ing is derived from the structure, not ap- plied to it. Through expressive inflections and distortions of the building body and frame, architecture expresses meaning in form. The 'Romantiques' conceived build- ing volumes as dynamic bodies. The skele- tal frame which structures the building becomes a diagram of forces active in the architectural body. The masonry skin, treated sculpturally and three-dimension- ally, further enlivens the architectural con- figuration. Describing the "Romantique' process of design, employed by Eugene Millet, L. Radoux wrote: 'He undertook a new construction with the ease of a sculptor modeling in clay or of a painter roughing out a sketch.... He would proceed always from the simple to the complex.... He would turn his attention first to the skeleton and when he had weighed and balanced all its parts, he dressed his building as needs and function would dictate and according to resources at hand, but always allowing, under the folds of the attire, the means to divine a healthy and vigorous form.'34 Hunt provided his students with examples of the French method of design. In 1 854, he worked in the drafting office of Hector- Martin Lefuel's New Louvre where he designed the Pavilion de la Biblioth6que. (Figure 2) lefuel contributed significantly to the development of nineteenth-century French classicism. Directed by his teacher, Hunt produced a complex composition. The Pavilion consists of a large vertical block flanked by shorter wings on either side. Hunt divided the building block with a grid of sharply projected stone moldings and bands which organizes a configura- tion of masonry panels. The panels were recessed and projected from the surface of the block to produce a sense of massive volume. Hunt sculpted the block. Forms and details were treated three-dimension- ally, layered and molded. Hunt's Pavilion composition was influenced by Lefuel who developed a peculiarly expressive style which David Van Zanten has described in terms of Scott's concept of 'Classical Humanism.' Looking at Lefuel's Louvre, Van Zanten points out: 'You sense the thrust and counterthrust [of architectural parts]; you feel your way into Lefuel's architecture, empathizing with it.' The sculpted masses of Lefuel's compositions suggest thickness and weight and even the possibility of movement. The forms seem active, 'gesticulating like human bodies.'35 In 1865-66 Hunt designed a museum for the New York Historical Society, which developed the Pavilion de la Bibliotheque composition further. (Figure 3) The Histori- cal Society Museum is more abstractly geometrical, a configuration of lines, planes, masses and voids composed in a rigid proportional system. The block is divided by broad pilasters and flat mold- ings which producesharply defined rhythms of layered forms. These broad surfaces and massive volumes are comparable to Hunt's Lenox Library, designed in 1870. (Figure 4) The Lenox represents the French idea fully developed in Hunt's architec- ture. The Pavilion de la Bibliotheque served as a direct model for Furness' Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1 871-1876). (Figure 1) Similar to Hunt's Pavilion, Furness conceived the Academy as a block with flanking wings. He divided the composition with a grid which became the proportional structure for the design.

Brick, limestone and granite parts fit pre- cisely together, compressed and inter- locked. Influenced by Hunt, and following closely Lefuel's method, Furness produced a composition characterized by a sculp- tural three-dimensionality. The parts are not applied as surface treatment, butappear as thick shapes formed from the body of the building. Similar to Hunt's banded columns which support the entrance por- tico of the Pavilion, Furness' colonnettes flanking the Gothic window of the Acad- emy mold light and shadow, thus modulat- ing the transition between mass and void. At the entrance, two thick columns are sharply incised into thick flat limestone balks. Silhouetted within the tight confines of their niches, the cylindrical columns contrast sharply with the angularity of cut stone; together they produce a sense of plastic form. Similarly, Furness' thickly molded entablatures, friezes and frames catch light in brilliant highlights and cast dark shadows to produce a composition of plasticity and volume. The composition, rich with discord and dissonance, is charged with an energy and tension. The parts seem capable of movement, as lines and surfaces, masses and voids compress and expand, abut and overlap. Forms seem to disappear behind others as vertical and horizontal elements intersect. In the process, some elements are abruptly cut off as they weave in and out. Surfaces are broken, patterns and rhythms stop and start, textures and colors vibrate and collide in a vigorous interaction. Furness closely calculated the massive movements and violent collisions of parts. Furness' approach to architecture radi- cally departed from traditional ideas. Organic theorists pointed out that all natu- ral forms are dynamic. The forces and pressures which interact in the structure of an animal, the tensions of muscles and joints as the organism moves, the patterns of growth and development visible in the forms of plants or shells, present the image of living form. If a work of art is to be expressive, it must be organically con- structed. Its elements cannot be composed as independent parts but interrelated in a dynamic, plastic system. Expression in architecture is based on the resolution of physical forces acting within the organic body. By thinking of buildings as organ- isms, Furness changed the concept of architecture from a static system to a dy- namic construction. He transformed the building block from an inert structure to a vital body. Elements formerly assembled as architectonic bits and pieces are in Furness' composition bound together in an architectural anatomy. The composition illustrates the actions and reactions of struc- tural forces acting within the building body. These forces suggest an immediate identi- fication of our own physical functions with those of the building. Furness fully developed the idea of or- ganic form in the Provident Life and Trust Building in Philadelphia (1879). (Figure 5) The Provident was also conceived as a massive block, divided by a proportional grid which formed a system of panels. Furness reduced the Academy's intricately woven fabric of overlapping parts to flat surfaces of granite. The restless movements which animate the Academy were elimi- nated. In the Provident the forms fit pre- cisely together, compressed and inter- locked. The Provident is a great granite block bal- anced on four great columns at ground level. Like giant muscles the column shafts compress and thicken. The capitals peel and splinter. They seem to explode under their load, rolling and twisting with a violent motion. The pressure flattens and rolls the column bases which flow out in great convolutions as though they were molten rock. Supporting the columns, thick granite blocks brace to receive the load. Furness chamfered these blocks so that they seem to bulge as the weight moves down upon them. The masses seem to swell and contract as if in response to the effort of support. The downward press of stone is countered by an upward pressure exerted within the voids which rise through the center of the composition. At ground level the void containing the entrance swells with a powerful vertical energy as the columns on either side compress. the upward move- ment pushes a massive granite arch which seems to dislodge from its bearing. It moves up and breaks through the line of the darker granite mass, pushing and frac- turing the sill of the window above. Under the window, great plates of granite splin- ter and peel as the volume expands up ward. It rises between compressed col- umns which hold a massive canopy above. Propelled by the upward energy, the void under the canopy exerts a powerful pres- sure which expands under a sharply pointed arch. The arch moves vigorously up. The plastic stone extends from its base, thick- ening with energy as it curves toward its apex. The momentum of upward move- ments telescopes, builds, and with a surge propels the canopy above the cornice line. The upward motion is finally stopped by a great stone cap. Furness' forms are dynamic and plastic. Imbued with the tensions of flexure the columns compress and expand as they struggle to support enormous weight. Arches thicken as they compress, or elongate as they spring from their bases. Voids expand and compress as they interact with the building mass. The parts receive and exert forces in a dialectic between weight and rigidity. Physical pressures seem to oper- ate in the body of stone as though it had come to life. Like a great living organism, the building structure distributes the pres- sure of masses within the block which rises with a monumental effort. When looking at Furness' composition, we realize the forces and pressures which act in the structure directly in terms of our own body experience. The forces exerted within the column are felt as though they were acting within us. The analogy be- tween the form and our own experience of gravity, weight, balance and tension is more than a casual comparison. We participate in the drama. The column becomes a living form and its life becomes a metaphor for our own. The forces we feel within our bodies such as the tension of muscles and joints as we initiate move- ment, maintain momentum and balance are replaced in the artistic composition by visual forces. Architecture is experienced physically, empathically. This empathic response is the basis for Furness' organic architecture. Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="9">US In 1873 Louis Sullivan joined the office of Frank Furness as an apprentice. He had studied architecture at MIT between 1872 and 1873. The school of architecture at MIT was established by William Ware, Furness' atelier-mate in Hunt's studio. Influ- enced by Hunt, Ware based the MIT curriculum on that of the Ecole des Beaux- Arts. Ware's young assistant, Eugene Letang, had recently completed studies at the Ecole in the atelier of one of the 'Romantique" group, Emile Vaudremere. Instructed by Ware and L6tang, Sullivan learned the principles of the 'Romantiques." Furness furthered Sullivan's French train- ing. In 1874, Sullivan left Furness' employ to attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he studied in the atelier Vaudremere.36 Sullivan's method of architectural compo- sition was derived from "Romantique' theory. He later acknowledged the influ- ence of the French theorists, in a letter to Claude Bragdon in 1904, wherein Sulli- van recalled: 'because of the teaching of the [French] school ... there entered my mind ... the germ of that law which later, after much observation of nature's process, I formu- lated in the phrase, 'Form follows Func- tion.'"37 Form is related to function, Sullivan rea- soned, in architecture and in nature: "All things in nature have a shape, that is to say, a form, an outward semblance, that tells us what they are, that distinguishes them from ourselves and from each other... 'These shapes express the inner life ... the beauty, the exquisite spontaneity, with which life seeks and takes on its form in an accord perfectly responsive to its needs. It seems ever as though the life and the form were absolutely one and inseparable, so adequate is the sense of fulfillment.... "... form ever follows function, and this is the law.'38 In accord with the French method of de- sign, Sullivan's process began with an idea. He conceived of building as the material embodiment of an idea, "an ex- pansive and rhythmic growth, in a build- ing, of a single, germinal impulse or idea, which shall permeate the mass and its every detail with the same spirit. 39Just as every living thing expresses its function in its form, abuilding must express its life in its structure. Function was an abstract idea, a concept distilled from life. In this sense, Sullivan began the design of the Wainwright Building (1891) (Figure 7) by defining the single idea which character- izes the life of the building. He wrote: 'We must now heed the imperative voice of emotion. Its demands of us, what is the chief characteristic of the tall office build- ing? And at once we answer, it is lofty. It must be tall, every inch of it tall. The force and power of altitude must be in it, the glory and pride of exaltation must be in it. It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exaltation.'40 Having established the idea, Sullivan turned his attention to structure. The tall office building was differentiated from other types of architecture by its structure: the steel frame. The structure evolved from specific functional demands. Unlike bearing-wall construction, the steel frame is light so that it can carry several stories of building with a minimum of structural mass and weight. It is open, allowing for maximum window surface so that light and ventilation can penetrate to the interior of the block. The steel frame is capable of withstanding building and wind loads which are pecu- liar to tall buildings. Within the structural skeleton, Sullivan fit- ted the spatial organs which form the building body. The Wainwright block is composed of three sections which corre- spond to the three functions of the tall building: a base which contains entrance lobbies and commercial spaces, a mid- section composed of office cells, and a cap which contains mechanical equip- ment.41 The three sections are differenti- ated because each performs a distinct function, and each function demands a form appropriate to it. Sullivan composed the Wainwright based on the building's structural frame, but as critics have pointed out, the relationship between form and structure is not absolute. Expression of structure was not the end of the architec- ture. Having fitted the spatial organs within the structural frame, Sullivan ad- justed the configuration to create a dy- namic form. Influenced by "Romantique" theory, he sought to animate structure, to produce a vital organic form through ex- pressive inflections and distortions of the building body and architectural frame. The first example of "Romantique' theory applied to building came from Furness, in whose office SulDvan worked while the Pennsylvania Academy was being de- signed. The Academy was the first work in which Furness developed his idea of organic expression, based on French theory. Another more immediate model came from Henry Hobson Richardson's Marshall Field Store (1885-1887). (Fig- ure 6) Richardson (1838-1885) studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the atelier of Louis-Jules Andr6 (1819-1890), a student of Jean-Nicolas Huyot and Hip- polyte Lebas. Andre was Inspector of the Biblioth6que National under Henri Labrouste, whom he succeeded as head of the independent atelier which Labrouste founded in opposition to traditional Ecole teaching. Like Labrouste, Andr6 was a principal in the "Romantique" movement and instructed his students in the theories and methods of the French revolutionar- ies.42 Richardson conceived the Marshall Field building as a massive block set on a thick battered foundation. The foundation seems to compress under the load of the block. Within the base Richardson exca- vated deep openings set under com- pressed arches which seem to deform as though in response to the powerful verti- cal movements above. Over each of the openings in the base springs a tall arch containing three stories of double win- dows. Above, two narrower arches rise vertically, each two stories tall. Finally a set of four rectangular windows termi- nates each vertica[bay. The multiplying rhythms of windows produce powerful vertical movements. Balancing these movements are horizontal rhythms which tightly bind the block. Linked arches produce a series of horizontal rhythms. Inset spandrels weave behind piers in Spring 1989 JAE 42/3</page><page sequence="10">continuous horizontal bands. Moldings, sills and the broad cornice further define the horizontal, as do the bands of stone blocks set in alternating horizontal courses.43 Similar to Furness, Richardson molded mass three-dimensionally, sculpt- ing the form out of a single masonry block. He conceived the composition as a dy- namic system of masses and voids which seem to move and deform in response to forces which emerge from deep within the building body. Sullivan understood Richardson's compo- sition as an organic form, charged with visual energies which pulsated throughout the block as though the configuration was alive. In Kindergarten Chats, Sullivan recalled his impression of the structure: "... here is a man for you to look at... a real man, a manly man: a virile force-broad, vigorous and with a whelm of energy- an entire male. I mean that stone and mortar, here, spring into life ...44 Sullivan's understanding of Richardson's design, described in anthropomorphic terms, was not a spontaneous insight. His thinking was prepared by studies with Ware and Letang at MIT and most signifi- cantly he was influenced by Furness whose buildings were for Sullivan vivid examples of organic architecture. In his Autobiogra- phy of an Idea, Sullivan recalled seeing Furness' Moore House: "Here was something fresh and fair to him, a human note, as though someone were talking ... [Sullivan] had an instinctive sense of physiognomy, and all buildings thus made their direct appeal to him."45 At the Ecole, these lessons were further re- inforced by Vaudremere. Sullivan also read Leopold Eidlitz's writings which influ- enced the formation of his organic archi- tecture.46 Sullivan applied the lessons learned from the Marshall Field composition to his own work, including the Auditorium Building (1886-1889), the Walker Warehouse (1890-1891), the Dooly Block (1890- 1891 and other buildings. Richardson's design eventually became the basis for the Wainwright Building. Similar to the Marshall Field, Sullivan conceived the Wainwright as a block set on a massive base.47 (Figure 7) The bottom two stories form a platform' out of which Sullivan excavated broad, nearly-square windows and deepset doorways. Above each of these, tall, narrow paired windows initiate the vertical movements of the upper sto- ries. At the same time, the equal rhythm of these windows emphasizes the horizontal dimension which is reiterated by the square molding which terminates the base, much the same way the cornice terminates the block. Above the base, slender piers rise continu- ously through seven stories. (Figure 8) The piers are set at the face of the block, in front of inset spandrels and windows. As the piers rise, their ascent is reinforced by the vertical rhythm of alternating spandrels and windows. The vertical movements of piers are balanced by horizontal lines formed by spandrels. The continuity of the horizontal lines is enhanced by the rich textures of ornament which fill each panel. Sullivan repeated the ornament horizon- tally, directing the eye to see the panels not as independent units but as continuous bands stretching behind the piers. Hori- zontal continuity is further enhanced by the long dimension of each panel, and the moldings at the sill and above the head of each window. In the vertical direction the ornament differs from panel to panel. Each panel is seen as an independent unit alternating with window panels rising with a regular vertical rhythm. Sullivan sculpted the parts of his composi- tion deep into the block. Piers alternate with inset spandrels and windows divid- ing the block into positive and negative vertical layers. As the sun moves across the facade, the flat piers remain bright in light while the deeply recessed windows and inset spandrel panels catch deep shadows. Light and dark, mass and void alternate abruptly. Sullivan molded the block so that the forms seem to emerge out of the masonry body. The sculpturalmass is as essential in Sullivan's composition as it was in Furness' and Richardson's de- signs. Similar to the Provident Life and Trust and the Marshall Field Store, Sullivan's Wainwright is a configuration of tightly interwoven forms which thrust and counterthrust, compress and expand. The Wainwright Building does not stand passively. The piers seem to receive and exert pressures, flexing and spring- ing with a dynamic force. The building seems to rise from its foundation as the piers, like legs, push the body vertically, countering the force of gravity with a muscular vigor. The piers physically il- lustrate the essential conflict which de- fines architecture; the opposition of weight and support, gravity and rigid- ity. Within the piers, Sullivan wrote, ... are balanced the two great forces, the simplest essential rhythms of Nature ...the rhythm of growth, of aspiration, and the counter-rhythm ... that which would crush to the earth...."48 The conflict between gravity and rigid- ity is made comprehensible empathi- cally. The dynamic composition creates forms of human feeling. It is a Gestaltof living experience. We perceive weight, pressure and resistance as bod- ily forces acting within the piers similar to our own bodily experience. Thus, the piers do not express the structure, but the life, the force which operates within it. The great block of the Wainwright Build- ing terminates in a massive cornice and roof slab'. The ornament in the cornice produces a climactic termination for the building. By its sheer mass, the pro- jected roof slab terminates the vertical energy initiated from below. When Frank Lloyd Wright saw Sullivan's sketch for the Wainwright, he recalled, "I was perfectly aware of what had happened.... This was Louis Sullivan's greatest moment -his greatest effort. The 'skyscraper' as a new thing under the sun, an entity with ... beauty all its own, was born."49 Wright was Sullivan's chief assistant when he designed the Wainwright Build- ing. He imbibed Sullivan's idea and Spring 1989 JAE 42/3 U</page><page sequence="11">U9 applied it to his work. Taught by Sullivan, Wright defined organic composition struc- turally. This idea was most clearly stated in an analysis of Japanese prints, published in 1912: "Japanese art is a thoroughly structural art; fundamentally so .... The realization of the primary importance of this element of 'struc- ture' is also at the very beginning of any real knowledge of design.... "The word structure is here used to desig- nate an organic form, ... a vital whole. So, in design, that element which we call its structure is primarily the pure form ... arranged or fashioned and grouped to 'build' the Idea .... Geometry is the gram- mar, so to speak, of the form. It is its architectural principle. A Japanese artist grasps form always by reaching under- neath for its geometry....He recognizes and acknowledges geometry as its aes- thetic skeleton ... not its structural skeleton alone, but ... the suggestive soul of his work... .50 Influenced by Sullivan, Wright realized that "there is a psychic correlation be- tween the geometry of form and our asso- ciated ideas which constitutes its symbolic value ... "This, he wrote, "is the suggestive soul" of nature-made and man-made forms.5 Wright elaborated upon his idea by using the example of a flower structure: "A flower is beautiful, we say -but why? Because in its geometry and in its sensuous qualities it is an embodiment and signifi- cant expression of that precious something in ourselves which we instinctively know to be Life, ... Intuitively we grasp something of it .... the quality in us which is our very life recognizes itself there .... So there vibrates in us a sympathetic chord struck mystically by the flower. Now, as it is with the flower, so is it with any work of art ... because a work of fine art is a blossom of the human soul .... In it we find the line- aments of man's thought and the exciting traces of man's feeling .... 52 Organic composition is structural, but not in the sense that form expresses the con- struction of a building directly. Such an interpretation of Sullivan's dictum -Form Follows Function -is superficial, which Wright disparaged as mere functionalism. Like Furness and Sullivan, Wright's work was based on a visual geometry, a dy- namic compositional structure which he recognized as the essential element of organic form. Organic forms are alive, and the sense of life is experienced empa- thically as forces and tensions present and active in visible shape. Notes 1 In 1951 Wlliam Campbell wrote, 'twas hewho ploughed the ground and prepared the soil that produced the architectural renaissance that followed.... Those who truly rejoice in a complete freedom finally conquered In the course of long struggle should not forget that to reach Wnght, Sullivan was necessary, and to reach Sullivan perhaps Fumess.' In 1957 Richard P. Adams suggested a relationship between Emerson, Greenough, Fumess and Sullivan. Adams disputed the tradi- tional argument that Richardson transmitted the organic idea to Sullivan. Rather, he wrote, 'he organic tradition moyhave been more directly tronsmitted through Frank Furess.'See Campbell, 'Frank Fumess an American Pioneer,' Architectural Review, Vol. 60 (19511), pp. 310-315, and Adams, 'Architecture and the Romantic Tradiion.

The Transcendentalst Idea of Louis Sullvan, University of Wisconsin (Madison, 1981). 4 The poet was the interpreter of nature, Sullivan believed. He wrote: 'So have I taken you to Nature, and shall again take you to Nature, to showyou how our moods parallel her moods; how her problems parallel our problems; and to bring you directly to the one unfailing source, the visible effect of creative energy, that you may find there, now and evermore, the keyto soluhons, to make plain to you what man may read In Nature's book, to the end that her processes may be our processes' that we may absorb somewhat of her fertility of resource, her admirable logic, her progression from function into form - her poetic finalites.'

Greenough was significantly influ- enced by the Germans. In 1839 he wrote to Charles Sumner.

Emotions are accompanied by visual modifications of the human form, which may be termed the physical function of an emotion. These are capable of being represented in matter by fine art, and this is the method by which fine art represents an idea in matter. ... the architect must evolve his forms from the Idea ... and impress these emotions upon matter....'

Tracing the development of this idea of expression, David Van Zanten writes that since the first decade of the nineteenth century, French theorists have formulated theories of artistic expression based on forms of aesthetic psychology. During the 1850s In France, Germany and England, such an aesthetic psychology became the basis for art theory until the twentieth century with writers such as Geoffrey Scott.

Sullivan's concept of 'idea' was derived from French theory. Lawrence Harvey, an English student at the Ecole, noted that 'French building s ... the organic outgrowth of one idea. Every portion, every ornament in the building ... subserves that idea or purpose.' Viollet-leOuc defined art as 'the form given to an idea, and the artist the one who, in creating the form succeeds in getting that very idea across to his fellow men.'

William Le Baron Jenney used Richardson's Marshall Field Building as a model for his Second Leiter Store (1889-91); however he did not understand Richardson's idea of composition. Jenney's composition Is structural in the sense that the form is based on the metal-frame construction of the building, rather than structural in the French sense. Lacking in Jenney's design is the sense of dynamic force which character- ized Richardson's composition. 46 Narciso Menocal has suggested a connection between Eidlitz and Sullivan in Architecture as Nature, op. cit., pp.64-66.
