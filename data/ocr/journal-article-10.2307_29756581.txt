<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kalai - Kafirnigan Problems in the Religion and Art of Early Mediaeval Tokharistan by B. A. Litvinskij The ancient town site of Kalai-Kafirnigan is situated on the left bank of the Kafirnigan river, 80 km. southwest of Dusanbe and 0.8 km. north of the village of Esanbaj. In this area the valley floor on the left bank is very narrow, whereas on the opposite side it is up to a kilometre wide. Just opposite the site the river forms a loop and flows past the hillside where the site is at a distance of only 200 m. About 5-6 km. east of the site the main mountain range runs in a north south direction. Parallel to it, chains of hills reach down to the river in gently rolling slopes that are completely treeless and waterless and covered with a semi desert vegetation. In and near the mountains there are occasional springs and brushwood of juniper shrubs. On the edge of one of these flat-topped hills that slope down to the river, a solitary south-facing outlier, stands the site of Kalai-Kafirnigan (fig. 1). Ac? tually this slope is the edge of a second alluvial terrace of the Kafirnigan and, in the area of the site, rises 8-13 m. above the adjacent part of the first terrace. The site consists of two parts, the southeastern corner where the citadel is being cut off from the rest by a moat. The settlement proper is in the shape of a long, tapering rectangle that runs north-south, with the northern end di? verging slightly eastwards. The overall surface measurements are: north-south 275 m., east-west 150 m. and 100 m. (in the south, exluding the citadel). The citadel has a five-sided ground-plan measuring 55 x 30 m. The area of the site is approximately 3.5 hectares. On the northern side the site of Kalai-Kafirnigan is bounded by a gully with a stream flowing through it. In some parts the gully has sheer sides that reach a height of 20 m. in the area of the site. A survey of the exploration trenches showed that the bottom consists of alluvial conglomerates, the upper level of which rises sharply on the southern side in an east-west direction, i.e. 35</page><page sequence="2">towards the river, from 5 to 15 m. above the level of the stream. Here and there in the surviving thickness there are pebbly lenses. Above the conglome? rates are variegated sedimentary clays. Still higher is the occupation layer, the height of which drops from 3.5 m. in the east to 1 m. in the west. Beyond the gully to the north, abutting upon the side of it, on the conti? nuation of the hill and on the edge of the terrace as well, there is a trapezoidal outlier that consists of two parts, with an overall length of 110 m. and 15-35 m. wide. It extends north-south with the broad side facing south towards the gully. It is now occupied by an ancient cemetery. On the edge of the western part there is masonry and scattered pottery of the Kushan period. Judging by the relief, this is a second town site, separate from Kalai-Ka firnigan: the gully already existed in the Kushan period. It was gradually eroded and widened by the stream and by precipitation. In the process the site of Kalai-Kafirnigan was partially undermined on the northern side, causing most of the north wall of the town to cave in. The town site of Kalai-Kafirnigan was bounded on the eastern side by a wall that has now collapsed. Along the wall there are the mounds of twelve towers, placed at fairly regular intervals (22-27.5 m. between their tops). Ge? nerally the line of the wall and the vestiges of the towers follow the drop in level of the town site, going from north to south, and the southeast corner is particularly low. The height of the towers above the level of the site differs only slightly from that of the wall between them (within 1-1.5 m. from the level of the towers). The dip between the northernmost tower and the one preceding it is an exception: here the wall is 3.5 m. lower than the towers abutting on to it. Even taking into account the "exploitation" of this dip (the modern road passes here), it was still lower than the others in earlier times. A ramp that runs parallel to the wall, rising in a south-north direction, leads to this point, and it quite possible that the main gate was here. We cannot exclude that there was another, secondary entrance as well. A ramp runs along the short southern wall, where there is only one tower not count? ing the corner one, and it comes to an end at the "moat" along the eastern side of the citadel; furthermore, the western street leads here too (see below). There is no trace of fortifications along the western side, towards the river. In all likelihood they have been carried off by erosion. As regards the period of construction of the fortifications, the only evidence we have to go by for the time being is that, in the surviving parts brought to light in the gully on the northern side there are square mud bricks measuring from 37 to 40 cm. Subsequent excavation of one tower on the eastern side showed that the fortification was built in pre-Kushan (Graeco-Bactrian?) times and functioned, with rebuilding, till early mediaeval times. The site was also formed in pre-Kushan times. 36</page><page sequence="3">The surface of the sahristan is uneven. The mounds rise in an extremely regular fashion, giving a good idea of the former layout. In the north, along the edge of the terrace, there is a built-up zone 35 m. wide, with a mound extending east-west on the southeast corner. A street, 5-7 m. wide, which is clearly visible in relief, begins at a point 30-35 m. west of the gate in the eastern wall and runs southwards parallel to the wall. After 115 m. it makes a sharp, almost right-angled turn westwards and continues for another 55 m. before forming a junction with another street run? ning south, parallel to the western boundary of the site. The length of this ap? parently narrow street is 135-140 m. The main excavation took place in 1974-1980 in the area of the sahristan (*). It was carried out by the South Tajikistan Archaeological Expedition (under the leadership of B. A. Litvinskij) of the Tajik Academy of Sciences, the Insti? tute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the Hermi? tage. As it is not possible for us to deal with the whole course of the work here, we shall dwell briefly upon only two of the ten sectors (obnekt) into which the area was divided and where excavation took place. Objekt I. The archaeological team was led by V. S. Solov'ev. A large complex of monumental buildings was brought to light in the southern part of the sahristan (fig. 3). The nucleus of the complex was a subquadrangular or, more precisely, diamond-shaped hall whose sides vary little in length (7.35-7.55 m.) but whose diagonals differ considerably (10.9 and 9.85 m.). It has an arched entrance facing north. The walls are built of pakhsa (beaten clay) blocks and are preserved to a height of 2-2.1 m. In the excavation of the outside wall, when a cut had been made in the southern additional wall, the main wall was found to consist of blocks of pakhsa with incised grooves along the sides. The horizontal layers of pakhsa walling are separated by a one-row band of brickwork. Inside the room the wall still had a fine coating of plaster, applied in two layers totalling a thickness of 5 cm. The 2 cm. thick daub surface layer is burnt throughout its thickness. Along the walls is a two-tiered bench. The upper bench is 1.1-1.5 m. wide and 0.4 m. high. Opposite the entrance the bench widens so as to form a right-angled "dais" on the same level as the bench, that juts out 0.4 m. and measures 1.95 m. across the front. Behind the dais, at a height of 0.3 m., there is a shallow niche in the wall, 0.3 m. deep and 3.6 m. wide, that is, wider than the front of the dais. The lower bench, 1.2-1.35 m. wide, is built up against (*) B.A. Litvinskij, ?Kalai Kafirnigan. Raskopki 1974 goda?, Arheologiceskie raboty v Tadzikistane, XIV, (1974) 1979, pp. 156-187; Id., Nastennaja zivopis Kalai-Kafirnigana, in Kavkaz i Srednjaja Azia v drevnosti i srednevekov'e, Moskva, 1981. 37</page><page sequence="4">the upper one. It is only slightly raised above the floor level, 0.1-0.15 m. in all. The floor proper in the centre of the room forms a square with sides 2.1 m. long. A considerable part of it is taken up by a rectangular pedestal measuring 1.4 X 1.25 m. with slightly rounded corners, that is off centre towards the dais. Its present height is 0.15-0.2 m. above floor level, but as its original upper surface is now missing it may have been somewhat higher. The present top sur? face of the pedestal and its sides are badly burnt. The entrance to the room was in the middle of the northern side. It was 1.4 m. wide and was covered by the usual arch with voussoirs of mud bricks placed as headers, while the first bricks were laid on the pier as stretchers. The arch has sunk, particularly the top and quite a lot of the archivolt. In the room the foundations of four columns were discovered. They were placed so as to form a 2.5 m. square. The foundations were set in the lower bench. As we were able to establish, a pit had been dug 0.45-0.5 m. deep and 0.7-0.75 m. per side, which was then filled in with a mixture of gravel and clay. This clay-gravel bed rose 4.5 cm. above the surface and was coated with clay on the outside, forming a pyramid-shaped pedestal (0.1 m. above floor level and 0.50 0.55 m. per side). Underneath the floor in the northwestern corner the founda? tion of the column is in the form of two roundish stone slabs laid flat (these mea? sure 0.9 X 0.5 X 0.05 m. and 0.52 X 0.37 X 0.05 m.). The stratigraphy was largely formed by a fire, in which the room was de? stroyed. Even before the fire the space between the central pedestal and the lower bench was filled in. It was literally crammed full of hardened ashes and charcoal. There were also tiny fragments of a large stone artefact with a polished edge and sherds of a coarse pot. The floor was also thoroughly burnt. All this makes it likely that the pedestal was the base of a fire altar. On the upper and lower benches, directly on the surface, there was a thick layer of decomposed burnt matting, and on top of this a layer of charred por? tions of the wooden roofing, and particularly of the columns (fig. 6). The most complete, southeastern one was lying along the eastern wall with its northern end nearer to the wall (at a distance of 1.41 and 1.13 m.). Lying across the column base there was a rectangular wooden grating. It was made of round wooden poles, up to 0.13 m. in diameter, intersecting at right angles so as to form equal-sized "cells" measuring 0.4 X 0.6 m. Near the wall, one of the poles of this grating is covered by a large flat block (0.2 X 0.08 m. in section) that was lying parallel to the eastern wall, 0.3 m. from it. Under the column, at an angle to it, lay another column that had fallen from the northeastern base, in a much worse state of preservation (for a descrip? tion of it, see below). There was also a badly worn stone door-socket, lying out of place. The other two columns lay scattered in small pieces. 38</page><page sequence="5">The space circumscribed by the upper bench was chock-full of charred wooden pieces of all sizes, some of them carved, including a fragment of wooden beam support, carved panels, etc. (for the description, see below). Higher up, about 0.8-1.0 m. above floor level, the layer is characterized by a large quantity of burnt soil, ash, and pieces of charred wood of all sizes, these being distributed unevenly in heaps. In the northwestern part of the room the heap against the western wall occupies an area measuring 0.6 m. (east-west) by 3.70 m. (north-south), in the northeastern part there was a heap measuring 2.60 m. (north-south) by 2.30 m. (east-west), and between them a metre-wide space in which there are practically no charred pieces of any importance. The northeastern heap consists of poles with a diameter of 0.14-0.16 m. and a maxi? mum preserved length of 1.8 m. intersecting on the same or on different levels. Together with these there are fragments of much larger ones (up to 0.2 m. in diameter). They all lay mostly at an angle to the walls. The poles only some? times intersect at right angles, and at other times obliquely. The southwestern heap has an even more amorphous nature. Along the footing of the southern wall there was a squared wooden beam (0.10 X 0.15 m. in section), about 1.5 m. long. Above this layer of burnt wood there is a filling layer of brick and pakhsa building material. The layer contains a smallish amount of pottery. There are no traces of a prolonged second settlement. A corridor ran along three sides of the hall (south, west, and north), each of these three sections originally being complete in itself, but subsequently the west and south sections were made to communicate by means of an arched doorway (see below). The northern section of the corridor, which no longer runs along the whole length of the room, was 9.7 m. long and 2.7 m. wide. It was into this northern corridor that the arched doorway of the hall opened. At the eastern end of this section of the corridor there are two short parallel walls, a metre apart. The later one was built against the eastern wall of the arched doorway, and the ear? lier one is situated still further east, limiting the original length of the corridor. On this easternmost wall there are two coats of plaster, the outer, extremely thick one being annealed by the fire. The wall was demolished in the middle ? evidently the access to the corner room was here. However, this short wall is not part of the original construction either. It appears that its brickwork was bonded with the brickwork of the later "casing" wall, that in this section was built against the main wall of the building. This makes us think that the original corridor continued quite a lot further eastwards. Subsequently, in the building of the northeast corner room (which is 4.9 m. square, with a metre-wide bench along the walls), the part of the corridor that occupied the side of this room was demolished. The end wall of the cor 39</page><page sequence="6">ridor formed the southern part of the western wall of the room, with which it communicated through a door in the wall. After the fire the new, blank wall was built, one brick wide in heading bond. Access to the room was gained through a newly opened doorway in the northern wall of the corridor, in the pier between the two short partition walls. We must remark that the reflex angle at the meeting point of the north and west sections of the corridor is rounded, and a subrectangular cavity, 0.36-0.40 m. long, is cut into the wall to a depth of 0.1-0.15 m. Inside it is filled with charcoal. A wooden column, partly sunken in the wall, was situated here. The entrance to the complex was in the south end of the western corridor, where there was a doorway 1.15 m. wide. It was formed by a pillar in the western wall and the continuation of the western wall of the corridor. At this original stage the length of the western corridor equalled 16 m., with a width of 2.8-3.1 m. At a later stage the meeting point between the western and southern cor? ridors was narrowed to 1.1 m. by brickwork, and the arched doorway was built. The arch is well preserved (fig. 4 above). The bricks outlining the archivolt are stretchers on edge, facing into the corridor as headers. The arch is formed of four courses, of which the lowermost one has sunk. The lowermost course rests directly on the edge of the pier; the abutments of the three upper curves have a stepped appearance, each one receding 0.2 m. from the edge of the pier and rising 0.25 m. Still later, the doorway was partly walled up by the construction in the western corridor of two brick pillars, which thus reduced the length of the corridor from 16 to 13.5 m. A peculiar feature in the layout of the northern and western sections of the corridor is the low, wide bench along the outer wall and the high, narrow plinth along the inner wall of the corridor. The corridor floor rises from the outer entrance (opening off the street) in the direction of the entrance into the central hall. The whole surface area of these sections of the corridor is co? vered to a thickness of four layers with charred portions of the roofing and de? corative panels. The southern corridor was excavated throughout the whole depth, but the eastern boundary has not yet been brought to light. The length of the excavated part of the corridor is 9.5 m., and the original width was 2.85 m. Along the walls ran two benches (0.25-0.30 m. in height) and between them was a fairly narrow space, not so wide as the benches (1.0-1.1 m.). Originally this area was covered by a barrel vault built without centering, with vertically inclined semi-circular courses, reaching as far as the western end of the corridor. To? wards this end the abutment of the vault rises in steps, and the slope of the bricks becomes almost vertical. A brick, or bricks (up to four) placed horizon? tally as headers served as the abutment to part of the vault. In order to con 40</page><page sequence="7">struct the vault a step was made in the outer half of the southern wall of the hall. Subsequently the vault collapsed (fig. 4 below) and in the process of the repair work its foundation was replaced by bricks laid horizontally. Then tho? rough rebuilding was undertaken. A low repair wall was built of single rows of stretchers against the northern wall of the corridor (measuring 0.35 m. counting the tiny space between it and the main wall. Then in the southwest corner of the area a pillar was erected (1.95 X 1.00 m.) so as to form the entrance to the western part of the corridor. This entrance was in the form of an arched doorway (see above). The base of a column was partly, though poorly, preserved on the north? eastern pyramid-shaped clay-gravel foundation. On the lower surface of the square wooden base (0.61 X 0.61 m.) a hollow was made all round (0.57 X 0.57 m.), so as to form raised edges 6-7 cm. high that fitted on to the pyramid-shaped foun? dation. The present height of the base (0.20 m.) cannot be taken as complete as its upper surface is missing. The sides were shaped so as to form a plinth with two sloping steps (3 and 2 cm.) that merged into a plain, slightly sloping surface with the upper half slightly rounded. In clearing the base, we gained the impression that it was a composite one consisting of five small boards, two of which were shaped along the sides and at the ends, and three at the ends only. Taking into account the poor state of preservation, we cannot rule out the possibility that these boards (strictly speaking, only two of them survive) are the result of cracking. However, it is not at all inconceivable that the base was not all in one piece, but a composite one. At Pendzikent a base was found shaped like a four-cornered pyramid with 80 cm. sides which ? was composed of closely fitting boards stacked together. Since a composite base of this type could not support a shaft, a wooden footing was placed on it, to which the shaft was fixed by means of a tenon ? (2). Composite bases were also discovered at Tashkent (3). The actual column that can be reconstructed on this foundation (fig. 5) is like the one that fell from the southeastern pedestal. Unfortunately the foot of the shaft and the topmost part are missing. The surviving part was about 3.30 m. long, and the original length was not less that 3.75 m. In the lower part there is an excellently preserved half of a spherical element, a k?zagi cjug5. The maximum preserved diameter of this element is 0.355-0.365 m., its probable dia? meter was 0.44 m. The hemispherical element merges smoothly into a narrower (2) V.L. Voronina, ?Arhitekturnyj ornament drevnego Pendzikenta?, in Zivopis' i skul'ptura Drevnego Pendzikenta, Moskva, 1959, p. 109; Id., ?

The join between the neck and the foot of the shaft is more distinct. The lowermost part of the shaft bulges slightly. The shaft has a marked entasis and tapers slightly downwards (1 cm. over a distance of 0.75 m.), after which it inclines sharply. The upper half of the neck and the foot of the shaft are carved with ver? tical grooves that become narrower towards the bottom, giving the foot a five lobed effect (height of lobes, 0.22 m.; depth of grooves, 0.04-0.045 m.). On the column there were two ornamental bands. The lower one, near the foot of the shaft, was c. 0.15 m. wide. In its lower part there was a wide strip of an intricate tendril design, and in the upper part, between borders of small squares and plain mouldings, there was a row of beads in relief. The upper or? namental band (at a distance of 0.67 m. from the other) is narrower (no more than 0.055 m.) and simpler: between double and single plain borders there is a line of three-cornered zig-zag. A distorted wooden beam, 0.48 m. long, 0.12-0.14 m. high and 0.175 m. wide, may possibly be counted as a beam support. The beam has been broken off so that only one end of it is left, and it is buckled. The top and bottom are plain. On the long sides the upper half bulges somewhat in a not-very-pro? nounced roll moulding which is covered with an incised pattern of small diamond shaped meshes. Lower down towards the edge, under the roll moulding, there is a cable that is split in two, with one strand extending down on to the bottom. On the short side, under the roll moulding (which here takes up a little more than a third of the height), there is a five-petalled half-palmette in the centre. The vertical ridge between the short and long sides is flattened somewhat in the lower half, and a large five-petalled rosette in relief is placed here - at an angle of 45? to the sides. Let us now examine the evidence for early mediaeval columns in Central Asia. The flat roofs of rooms and ivans, and the canopies of thrones had wooden columns; wooden and clay columns reinforced the inside corners of walls; clay columns were placed in the corners of niches, particularly of ritual hearths. An idea of the character of these columns was gained from the representa? tions of them in the Biya-Naiman ossuaries and other iconographical evidence (4), and this was subsequently added to as a result of archaeological finds. The wooden bases of columns (5) were of several types. (4) V.L. Voronina, ?

Above this again is a piriform element with an elongated "neck" above and below it, and at the top a double roll moulding. The base rests on a foun? dation made of boards (9). The bases of type 5 are very much like those of type 3, and if we assume that the latter had an upper element, namely the piriform one, then they are variants of the same type. The bases of the clay columns at Pendzikent were either of a block-like pyramid shape, or else they were a repetition of the shape that is seen in the wooden bases of type 4, except that the piriform element was separated at the top and bottom by roll mouldings (10). At Kafyr-Kala a simpler base occurs, like the lower part of these, i.e. without the piriform element (1X). In Northern Tokharistan, however, there were column bases that were similar or identical to the ones at Pendzikent. There is a column like this at Kafyr-Kala too, but in a different building (12). We can also get an idea from the three-quarter columns and pilasters on clay and alabaster miniature st?pas. There are several versions of them.

One of its sides (right at the corner) is almost vertical, and the other (towards the inside) has a sharp curving incline. On this block? like foundation there is a scotia, then a broad roll moulding, then another scotia. After this there is a narrow roll moulding (not present in all cases), then a bulge that merges into the shaft (13). A column on the alabaster facing of a miniature st?pa has a pyramid-shaped, block-like base, with a segmented, elongated sphere on it, separated above and below by a flat moulding. The bases of the pilasters were sometimes in the form of two-stepped pedestals (14). There were also clay pilasters whose bases, likewise of clay, were hexagonal in plan with concave sides in both plan and profile. Pendzikent (15). Stone bases continued to be discovered, though rarely, including some of the same shape as the wooden ones of type 3 (16). Capitals belonging to wooden bases are well known at Pendzikent. The capital from Room 81 in ob"ekt III at Pendzikent is separated from the shaft by a wave moulding. It is truncate-conical in shape, 45 cm. high, and its surface is covered with two rows of carved leaves. In Room 55 of ob"ekt III at Pendzikent a similarly shaped capital, though plain, without carving, is topped by an octagonal abacus adorned with a plant motif. An impost block was used for the crossing of the purlins, and sometimes became one with the purlin. The impost was decorated with volute-like scrolls (17). On the capital of the clay corner column at Adzina-Tepa, each face is shaped like an irregular rhomboid that broadens towards the top (18). The niche co? lumns from Kafyr-Kala have a slightly concave necking, above which a bell ca? pital widens sharply towards the top (19). The columns on the miniature st?pas from Adzina-Tepa have two-stepped capitals with the sides slanting upwards and outwards (20). In other cases the lower part of the capital is spherical or (13) Id., ibid. (14) Finds from the excavations of B.A. Litvinskij and T.I. ZejmaP: B.A. Litvinskij, T.I.

At Adzina -Tepa columns of this type were without bases, and the shaft stood directly on the floor (23). The shaft of the column was obviously, mostly round in section, tapering towards the top and bulging at the foot. At the same time the pilasters had a rectangular, faceted form. On the ossuaries from Biya-Naiman (24) and in the paintings at Varahsa (25) and Pendzikent, there are representations of caryatids. That this was not merely a subject of paintings but something that really existed is shown by the wooden sculptures representing female figures (height 1.20-1.25 m.) that supported a canopy, from Pendzikent (26). On the aforementioned ossuaries from Biya-Naiman and in several works of painting (27) and toreutics, there are representations of arcades. In actual fact these have come to light only at Varahsa, where they have three spans. The arches are supported by massive round brick columns with a span of 7.75 m. in the centre and of 3.25 m. between the columns and the engaged columns in the walls. The central span was higher than the lateral ones (28). Sometimes the arches are supported by wooden posts. At Pendzikent one room was divided into two parts by means of an arch that was supported by two wooden co? lumns standing against the longitudinal walls (29). It would be premature as yet to draw conclusions about the proportions of the Central Asian early mediaeval order. But the existing evidence, as V. L. Vo? ronina, B. A. NiPsen and G. P. Pugacenkova have pointed out, allows us to put forward a fairly well-founded hypothesis that, for all the difference between the Central Asian early mediaeval order and the ancient one, its origin clearly lies in Central Asian antiquity. Thus there can be no doubt about the influence of (21) Litvinskij, ZeimaP, Adzina-Tepa, cit., p. 49. (22) Voronina, ?Arhitektura... ?, cit., p. 213. (23) Litvinskij, Zejmar, Adzina-Tepa, cit., p. 49.

On the other hand, the Attic profile, in a very modi? fied form, affected the bases of type 3 and partly those of types 4 and 5. As for the capitals, it is evident that elements of Corinthian capitals con? tinued to survive in early mediaeval capitals: as can be seen from paintings and from actual finds, rows of acanthus leaves and volutes continued to be used in a modified version. We may say that, in the early Middle Ages, the Helle? nistic tradition was completely assimilated by the local one, that imparted to it a distinctive colouring. It was precisely in the Middle Ages that there came into being a completely new type of local column with the characteristic spherical element (k?zagi) be? tween the base and the shaft, as well as the system of richly ornamented beam supports etc. (fig. 10). It is possible to give a reconstruction of this column (using archaeological and ethnographic parallels) (30) like that of the sufficiently similar Pendzikent ones. A wooden footing, made in one piece, was set on a base made of boards. On top of this, the spherical element of the column shaft was fixed by means of a tenon. The shaft, unlike the ones from Pendzikent, was, although sparingly, decorated with carving. There must have been a capital on the shaft, separated from it by a raised band. We can reconstruct it as having two parts, the bottom part increasing in width and the top part cylindrical. If our reconstruction is correct, the height of the column must have been of the order of 4.5 m. In southern Tajikistan, wooden columns in the folk-architecture of public buildings reached a height of 5.87 m. In the mosques at Samarkand in the rooms with four columns, the height was usually 1.5 and sometimes 1.75 times more than the span between the columns (31). By applying these proportions, the height of the room could reach 4.4 m. In ancient Pendzikent the rooms reached a height of 5 m. Consequently, a height of the order of 4.5 m. for the columns is quite conceivable. On the capital there was a carved beam-support, to some extent resembling the column from Oburd?n (32). The whole appearance of the column at Kalai-Kafirnigan relates it to the one (30) por ethnographic parallels, see in particular L.I.

At the same time there are evidently features that connect this column with the columns in mediaeval and folk architecture, especially the latter (33). As far as the ceiling is concerned, considering the abundance of carved wood, it must have been of the same kind as the kushkabzi at Samarkand and Bukhara. Kushkabzi means '"small double planks5 in Tajik. Another name for this ceiling is takhti-norbonay ""ceiling resembling a staircase5 (34) ? that is, a kind of coffered ceiling, where the underside of the beams was carved, and the interior was decorated with carved wooden panels. The largest panel of those discovered in the hall consisted of two narrow boards that originally formed a single whole; both of them have considerable parts missing, especially the lower one. One of the boards measures 2.24 X 0.20-0.24 m. and the other 1.74 X 0.24 m., and they are 4 cm. thick. The edge was cut on a slant inwards. The whole surface was covered with a large ornamental design consisting of two birds facing each other (figs. 8, 9). The centre of the pattern is taken up by a six-petalled rosette in the upper half, with its short stem standing on a semicircle (width of its border 1.5-1.7 cm., height 1.3-1.5 cm.). The bird's head is drawn realistically. The sharply curved beak is bifurcate, and the round bulging eye is outlined by a circle. The crest consists of two adjoining lobes within a narrow checkered border in which the checks grow smaller towards the top (0.7 X 0.7, 0.5 X 0.5, 0.2 X 0.2 cm.), and inside the lobes there are four or five thin vertical lines. The head is held level, forming a sharp bend with the massive neck in which five narrow grooves are cut lengthwise. At the base of the neck a cross-band passes around it and upwards to join a toothed comb reaching back down from the crest. The continuation of the cross-band takes the shape of two ribbons tied in a knot that flutter out from the crest. The upper part of the bird's body is charred and the details have been obli? terated. In the lower half we can make out an incised mesh pattern covering the forepart, while the hind part is marked all over with short, wide, overlapping feathers. The large luxuriant tail looks like a bunch of narrow ribbons which divide in the centre so as to form an oval with pointed ends. Inside the oval, a "tre? foil" stems horizontally from its foremost end, while in the hind part there are two vertical trefoils joined by their curved stems. Above and below the oval the tail consists of three narrow, sharply curved leaf-like feathers. (M) Particularly characteristic is the resemblance between the lobed appearance of the bottom of the column shaft and the fluting on the shaft of the columns in folk architecture from southern Tajikistan. (34) Pisarcik, op. cit., p. 80. 47</page><page sequence="14">In its beak the bird is holding a tendril with one end trailing backwards to where there are two rosettes under the bird's body, and the other end hang? ing down in front where, presumably, there was another rosette. Of the bird on the right only part of the head survives and a few small portions of the tail. According to the observations of the present writer and the restorer Ju. I. Til'man, the carving of the panel was executed in the following manner. After the surface of the board had been smoothed the design was traced in outline. Using the outline as a guide, the design was then cut out at right angles to the surface, and the parts that were intended as the background were cut away with a flat chisel to an equal depth (of the order of 1 cm.) over the whole surface. In this, as in the subsequent stages of the work, only flat right-angled and oblique-angled chisels were used. Next the actual figures of the birds and the other elements of the design were executed, with the bird's body and crest being worked in particularly fine detail. The side edges were either cut vertically or slanted. The artist paid heed to any particular features in the texture of the panel: for instance, the crest is worked so as to avoid a knot in the wood. The relief was apparently not polished after the chisel-work had been completed, and it is due to this that traces of the tool have survived. A characteristic feature of the representation is the absolute predominance of the tail, which is equal to two-thirds of the total length of the figure. Ano? ther feature is the sharp contrast between the fairly realistic rendering of the head and body on the one hand, and the entirely conventional treatment of the tail. As far as style is concerned, the Kalai-Kafirnigan peacocks are quite unique. Another work will be devoted to an artistic-stylistic and semantic study of the representation (35). It is not possible to give here a description of the scores of ornamental wooden panels and beams from the corridor around the hall. We shall merely point out that in the decoration of the panels two motifs are prevalent: twisting vine-shoots with leaves, bunches of grapes and tendrils, and a design with ar? ches (figs. 11-14). Kalai-Kafirnigan is the second site where carved wood has been found in Tokharistan, after Dzumalak-Tepe (Surhandar District of the Uzbek SSR) (36). (35) We shall merely remark here that in Tajik-Persian verse, the peacock appears as the symbol of the universe: in appearance the world was like a peacock (Daqiqi): M.-N. O. Osmanov, StiV persidskotadzikskoj poesii IX-X vv.} Moskva, 1974, pp. 25-26. C36) NiTsen, op. cit.t pp. 140-53, 303-308. There are also important finds of carved wood in Southern Sogdiana, in the Kaska-darja region: see B.D. Kocnev, R.D. Ruzanov, ?Rannesrednevekovoe reznoe derevo iz Tallisortepa?, Obscestvennye nauki v Ubzekistane, 4, 1973. 48</page><page sequence="15">The finds from Kalai-Kafirnigan give us a much wider view of carved wood in Tokharistan (3T), and of how the interiors of the buildings were decorated. At Kalai-Kafirnigan the wooden panels were apparently arranged in much the same position as at Dzumalak-Tepe (38). Together with the splendid works of art from Sogdiana (Pendzikent, Talli-Sortepe, Gardoni-Hisor) and Ustrusana (Sahri stan), these finds form part of the vast cycle of architectural decorative art of Central Asia in the early Middle Ages. In its layout the hall in complex I (fig. 7) closely resembles the main rooms in the residential quarters at Pendzikent. However, the presence of the altar base in the middle of the hall and the corridor round the outside, as well as the "elevated tone" of the place, lay open to doubt the opportuneness of defining the complex at Kalai-Kafirnigan merely as a residential one (reception-room). We cannot rule out the possibility that this complex, originally at any rate, had a cultic function, or else that it fulfilled both cultic and residential purposes at once. In 1975 the excavation of ob)}ekt V, under the direction of A. V. Sedov, was begun (fig. 2). This area is adjacent to the foregoing one, from which it is separated only by an ancient street running between them. Before excavation this part of the site was occupied by a roundish hillock that covered an area of 30x30 m. The general layout of the building that came to light ? a Buddhist temple ? is as follows. The central room was a square sanctuary with two entrances aligned on the same axis, and with a II-shaped corridor running along three sides and a four-columned portico on the fourth side, in front of one of the entrances. From the section of the corridor on the side opposite the portico there was a doorway leading into a small square room that was situated almost in alignment with the two doors of the sanctuary, and another doorway leading into the rooms of the outer zone (two rooms joined by a long, narrow passage). Adjacent to the portico was a closed court, of which only a small area of the western part has been excavated. The ground^plan of the sanctuary was an almost perfect square (sides 4.65 X 4.95, diagonals 6.80 and 6.68 m.). In the middle of two of the walls, directly opposite each other, there is an arched doorway (the one leading into the inner part of the building is 1.87 m. wide, and the one opening on to the portico 1.68 m.). The doorways are aligned on a NEE-SWW axis. The corners of the room are taken up by pedestals whose shape is that of (37) Its proximity to the carved wood from the mountainous region of Sogdiana is evi? dent: see V.L. Voronina, ? Zamok Gardani-Hisor i ego reznoi ornament?, Problemy istorii arhitektury. Sbornik naucnyh trudov, Moskva, 1974. (38) Nil'sen, op. cit., pp. 303-308. 49</page><page sequence="16">an irregular pentagon. The one in the northwestern corner measures 0.58 m. along the front, 0.50 m. in depth, 0.20-0.22 m. at the sides and 0.40 m. in height. Like the other pedestals it has preserved on its top surface traces of the feet of a standing statue, now missing (39). In the middle of the southern wall there is a large, deep, arched niche that measures 1.66 m. across the front and 0.8 m. in depth. Inside the niche there is a lowish ?-shaped pedestal with its "cross piece", which is higher than the sides, towards the back wall of the niche. On the pedestal was a seated image of the Buddha, of which the bottom part and the head survive. In the left side of the niche there was a recess in which thirty seven clay lamps had been sealed (40). In the centre of the room stands a large, two-stepped, star-shaped structure. The lower element has a rectangular ground-plan (1.90 X 1.70 m., height 0.37 0.40 m.). In the middle of its northern, southern and western sides there is a short projection of the same height, that juts out 0.30 m. and measures 0.55 0.60 m. across the front. The upper element is smaller than the lower one: it measures 1.65 X 1.65 m. and 0.45 m. in height, but the top is missing. There are recesses on three sides that correspond with the three projections in the lower element: these measure 0.52-0.57 m. across the front and 0.35-0.38 m. in depth. The eastern side, which faces towards the doorway opening on to the por? tico, is formed of a block-like base joined on to the main part, with quarter-dome niches in the front corners. This part juts out 0.29 m. from the main structure, is 1.26 m. wide, and is preserved to a height of 0.75 m. It was joined on to the main part at a later stage. Considering the existing analogies, we may sup? pose that this base with quarter-dome niches in the front corners was destined to hold a seated image of the Buddha. (39) A similar arrangement of pedestals which had standing statues on them can be seen in the corners of the square room 36 at Tapa Sard?r: see ? IsMEO Activities ?, EW, 19, 1969, p. 545, fig. 9. (40) According to the testimony of Fa-Hsien, in the region of Taxila, the king, the ministers and the people vied in the strewing of flowers and the lighting of lamps before the st?pas (he gives similar information about other places in India as well). The pilgrim recounts an extremely interesting particular about one of the temples: at its gates sat vendors of flowers and censers, which were bought by whoever wished to make an offering (Fa Hsien, The Record of the Buddhist Countries, Peking, 1957, pp. 27, 30-31 etc.). In the paintings of Eastern Turkestan there are representations of worshippers, each with five lamps (sometimes lighted) on the head, shoulders and arms (A. Gr?nwedel, Altbuddhisti? sche Kultst?tten aus Chinesisch-Turkistan, Berlin, 1912, pp. 74, 93, 183-84. At Adzina-Tepa, in cells VII and VIII, hundreds of lamps were found piled up on the floor (Litvinskij, ZejmaT, Adzina-Tepa, cit., p. 22). Buddhist religious texts contain instructions concerning the presentation of lamps to Buddhist holy places: L.A. Bareau, ? La construction et le culte des stupa d'apres les Vinayapitaka ?, BEFEO, L 2, 1962, p. 244. 50</page><page sequence="17">Originally the base was cross-shaped (41). On each of its projections there was a standing cult statue (of which only the feet are still in situ). The base may be taken as being of a st?pa or caitya. In the sanctuary there were at least nine large statues (four on the corner pedestals, four on the central base, and one in the niche) and, as is shown by the fragments, several small ones. In this respect room 2 may be compared with the patim?geha, the chouse of the sacred image5 in the Buddhist temples of Cey? lon (42'). The sanctuary walls are 1.2-1.25 m. thick, and their outside perimeter forms a rectangle measuring 7.0 X 7.4 m. The outer face of the walls is not vertical but has a marked batter. The corridor running along three sides of the sanctuary is 2.12-2.20 m. wide. In its southern section a niche, 0.3 m. deep, was made in the sanctuary wall, its sides corresponding with those of the niche inside the sanctuary. In the niche was a seated image of the Buddha (for a description of it, see below). The entire surface of the corridor walls was covered with paintings (see below). The corridor had a vaulted roof. The square room (room 3) to which access was gained from the western section of the corridor, was situated more or less in alignment with the axis of the sanctuary. It was quite small (2.55 x2.60 m.) and its floor level was consi? derably higher than the floors of the other rooms. Unlike all the aforemen? tioned rooms, which have pakhsa walls, room 3 has walls built of mud bricks. There are squinches in the corners of the room, at a height of 0.7 m. above floor level. These squinches have a "core" consisting of four bricks laid as headers in the very corner, on either side of which bricks are placed slantwise. The gra? dually projecting arches were built around this "core", thus forming the squinches. A deep, arched niche was made in the centre of three of the four walls (excepting the wall with the door) at a height of 0.4-0.6 m. above floor level. These measured 0.75-0.80 m. across the front and 0.52 m. in depth, and all the arches had a stilted profile. Judging by the best preserved, southeastern corner, the vertical walls (together with the squinches) reached a height of 1.30 m., above which the radial brickwork of the dome began (fig. 17). The four-columned portico is situated 1.4-1.5 m. east of the eastern wall of the sanctuary. Three stone bases survive, and the hollow left by the fourth (41) This has an analogy in Eastern Turkestan: see A. Gr?nwedel, Bericht ?ber arch?olo? gische Arbeiten in Idikutschari und Umgebung Winter 1902-1903, (Abhandlungen der K. Bayer. Akademie der Wissenschaften, I KL, XXIV. Bd., I. Abt.), M?nchen, 1905, figs. 10, 25, 41a; S.F. OFdenburg, ? Russkaja Turkestanskaja ekspedicija 1909-1910 goda ?, St. Peters? burg, 1914, figs. 26, 27, pp. 25-27. C42) W. Geiger, Culture of Ceylon in Mediaeval Times, Wiesbaden, 1960, p. 191. 51</page><page sequence="18">one. Two of the bases are blocks of stone, and one consists of a torus on a two stepped plinth. The sanctuary had a complicated history which is still not quite clear to us. We can, however, at the present stage of research make some remarks, although they are not, of course, to be taken as definitive. 1. Different parts of the complex belong to different periods. The very appearance of the complex underwent radical changes in the course of its history (fig. 19). 2. The sanctuary walls batter instead of being vertical and the marked lack of precise alignment between the sanctuary and room 3, as well as other observations, are evidence that the sanctuary originally existed as a separate building (Period I). It had a central plan with four entrances, the main entrance being the western one (it is wider and more important). 3. At a later date the small brick cella was built, possibly for auxiliary purposes (a cell? a repository?). The complex was now composed of two build? ings (Period II). 4. Then the corridor was built around the sanctuary, in such a way as to include the cella in the arrangement. The rooms for habitation on the western side were also built, with their layout partly following the line of the steep slope of the hill on which the sahristan stands. On the eastern side the portico was erected (Period III). The orientation of the sanctuary was changed, with the eastern entrance becoming the main one. In connection with these altera? tions, the central base was also made to face eastwards by the addition of the pedestal with the seated Buddha. Then in the southern entrance, on both the sanctuary and the corridor side, were placed bases with seated statues, back to back. The dating of the last period can be established on the grounds of coin finds and other evidence to the beginning of the 7th ? middle of the 8th century. Periods I and II should, in all likelihood, be dated from the end of the 5th to the beginning of the 7th century. In the last period the complex was undoubtedly a Buddhist temple, a vih? ra, a fact of vital importance for the history of Buddhism in Tokharistan. If we are to go by the historical sources, Buddhism was widespread in Tokharistan in the early Middle Ages (5th-8th centuries), just before the Arab conquest (43). Until a short time ago the only concrete evidence available to science concerning the territory of South Tajikistan was the extremely laconic reports of the Buddhist pilgrims. Hs?an Tsang mentions that at Chagh?ni?n there were five monasteries with a fair number of monks; at Sh?m?n there were (43) B.A. Litvinsky, Outline History of Buddhism in Central Asia, Moscow, 1968, pp. 55-58. 52</page><page sequence="19">two monasteries and a small number of monks; at Kabadian there were three monasteries and about a hundred monks (44). He names another two districts, Wakhsh and Khuttal, but in his extremely laconic notes on these districts he says nothing at all about Buddhism (45). On the contrary, Huei-ch'ao tells us about Khuttal: ? The king, the nobles and the people believe in the triratna, there are monasteries and monks, they profess the doctrine of Hinayana ? (46). Systematic archaeological work in Tajikistan (47) has introduced a lot of new evidence into the discussion of this matter. Near Kurgan-T'ube, T. I. ZejmaP and the present writer discovered and completely excavated in 1960-1975 an entire Buddhist monastery of the 7th-8th centuries ? Adzina-Tepa (48). Over an area of 100 X 50 m. a whole complex of rooms was brought to light: the sanctuary, the congregational hall, the cells, the main st?pa and other st?pas, the store-rooms and rooms for other economic purposes. These excava? tions provided abundant evidence on the Buddhist architecture of early mediaeval Tokharistan, and brought to light a whole gallery of works of art. The clay images included tiny Buddhist "icons" and a colossal Buddha in parinirv?na. There were also various wall paintings. In 1968-1970, in the southeast corner of the palace buildings on the citadel of Kafyr-Kala (district centre Kolkhozabad), which was excavated by the present writer, a small Buddhist chapel was discovered. It consisted of a square sanctuary (3.4 X 3.4 m.) with a corridor round all four sides (length of each section 9 m.). In the sanctuary there were paintings of Buddhist subjects (49). (44) S.

Vorob'eva-Desjatovska has identified as being written in Brahml script, and probably Buddhist in content. (Buddhist birch bark manuscripts of the early mediaeval period have also been found in Surkhan Darya District at the site of Zang-Tepe.) Now Kalai-Kafirnigan gives us still another example of a Buddhist monu? ment. And so, in the last period, the building at Kalai-Kafirnigan was undoubtedly a Buddhist temple (vih?ra). For the early period we have no evidence concern? ing the functions of the building. From the point of view of its layout the room with a central plan and four entrances is perfectly analogous to the Iranian fire sanctuaries ? Cah?r T?q (50). This identity cannot, of course, be taken as proof that the building at Kalai-Kafirnigan was also a fire temple. As early as Achaemenian times, judging by the temple at Susa, there were buildings in which the central room of the sanctuary had a narrow corridor all round it, and a portico on the side where the entrance was (51). At Kuh-i Hw?ga, in the topmost layer, E. Herzfeld discovered a square room covered by a dome resting on four corner arches, with a narrow vaulted gallery all around it (a krypta in Greek terminology), and a monumental entrance. ? Those are the three constituent parts of a fire-temple. The entrance may as? sume various shapes. The cupola was the sanctissimum. At the K?h i Khw?ja, in its centre, the pedestal of a fire-altar was excavated, and the altar itself was found, overturned, near by ... The krypta at the same time separated the sanc? tuary from the profane outer world, and served for the ceremony of circumam bulation ? (52). Kuh-i Hw?ga is interesting in so far as, in the first two phases of the existing sanctuary, as well as the corridor all round it, there was also a four columned portico (53). The same architectural idea is reflected in the central part of the temple of Oxos at the site of Takhti Sangin, which was built in the 3rd-2nd centuries B.C. (54). I have already had occasion to state my point of view that the type of sanctuary surrounded by a corridor in Buddhist cultic architecture developed out (50) K. Schippmann, Die iranischen Feuerheiligt?mer, Berlin-New York, 1971. (51) Id., ibid., pp. 266-74, fig. 38. E. Herzfeld, Iran in the Ancient East, London-New York, 1941, pp. 301-302.

This layout was reflected in Central Asian architecture where two variants are found, with and without the portico. Kara-tepe, Surkh Kotal, Kafyr-Kala and the second temple at Ak-Besim belong to the first group, and Kalai-Kafirnigan, Pendzikent and the first temple at Ak-Besim belong to the second. Particularly similar solutions can be seen in the layout of the temple at Kalai-Kafirnigan and the first temple at Ak-Besim (56). The temple at Kalai Kafirnigan occupies an important place in the typology of buildings of this kind and in their evolution both in Central Asia and in Eastern Turkestan (57). In the last period, when the building at Kalai-Kafirnigan was undoubtedly a Buddhist one (we cannot exclude that it was Buddhist in the first two periods as well, though this cannot be proved), the walls of the corridor around the sanctuary were entirely covered with paintings. All that survives in situ is a portion of the painting 1.90 m. long and 1.30 m. high on the western wall of the western section of the corridor (fig. 20). It is the central and upper part of a two-tiered composition, of which the upper register is preserved to one third of its original height and the lower register is complete. The upper register of the composition is entirely taken up by the central, seated image of the Bud? dha with two personages standing at his sides. In the lower register a proces? sion advances to the right. Let us dwell for a moment on some particulars. The central figure of the upper register is seated on a complicated throne. Below it two plants diverge at the centre, their ends rising upwards and outwards. The plant consists of two stylized lotus blossoms, placed one on top of the other and facing in opposite directions. They are coloured pink with a dark-brown outline. The curved ends of the plants rise steeply, as though they were bordering the throne on either side. Above the plants is a cream-coloured band that is split into two lengthwise, with hatching in the lower part. Above this again is a yellow cu (55) Litvinsky, Outline History of Buddhism..., cit., pp. 106-108. This type had a remote genetic connection with much earlier Indo-European ritual ideas: see G.R.H.

Gr?nwedel wrote prophetically about Eastern Turkestan: ? About the buildings, which are situated throughout the territory, we may note that their layout follows the pattern of the Sassanian palaces, but they were adapted for public worship or, more precisely, for the legend of Buddhism ? - A.

The Buddha is seated on the cushion in padmas?n?. The legs and the left hand are preserved. The complicated folds of the garment have a definite arrangement by which the artist skilfully gave volume to his work. The cloth is painted yellow with a decoration of plant motifs. The free end of the sangh?ti hangs down as a triple, fan-shaped element, while the central part is formed of deeply curved folds. The distance between the knees is about 1.0 m., so that the height of the figure must have been of the order of 1.10-1.20 m. On either side of the Bud? dha there were two standing figures. The upper and lower registers were separated from each other by a black border with white ovals. In the lower register a composition of many figures is strung out on a red background: there are large figures about 0.70 m. high, between which appear smaller ones about two-thirds their size. On the left of the composition there are two standing female figures facing right. The one on the extreme left has both head and body in three-quarter view. She has a broad oval face with a heavy, massive jaw. The left eye is preserved: it is a narrow, horizontal oval, almost a slit, which widens towards the nose and comes to a point at the opposite end. The arched eyebrows are set high. The face and the short neck are cream-coloured. The black hair is drawn back in a knot, leaving a wedge-shaped lock in front of the ear. The forehead is bound by a broad fillet, on which brown lines indicating stripes are drawn lengthwise on a yellow ground. In her ears she wears elaborate yellow coloured ear-rings. The raised left hand is stretched out in front, with the thumb and index finger pressed together and the other fingers clenched. The fingers grip the tip of the curved stem of a flower which the personage is holding in front of her. The pointed petals of the flower are painted white, like the stem, and outlined in black. In her lowered right hand the woman is holding a yellow bowl, on whose surface faint, upward curving lines can be made out, perhaps rendering fluting. In the upper part of the bowl are six semicircles that may represent fruit. The woman is wearing a long gown and an ankle-length cloak that is thrown open. The dress has a high, straight neckline with a wide dark-blue collar adorned with white circles. The bodice of the dress is pink with two circles at the bosom, possibly to render the swellings of the body. The wide, loose sleeves that hang down without folds are dark blue with a pattern of white circles on them. The arms are adorned at the wrists with wide, flat yellow bracelets. From the hips down the dress is dark blue. From underneath the straight hem the out-turned feet, wearing pointed shoes, protrude. The cloak is flung wide open and the flaps turned back to show the yellow lining with a scalloped edge, filled in with black circles. The cloak is also yellow on the outside, but of a darker shade. 56</page><page sequence="23">As a whole the figure is bell-shaped, slightly wider at the bottom, with very narrow, sloping shoulders. The next female figure (fig. 26) is very like the one just described in pos? ture, but there are many differences in the details. The head is larger with a somewhat longer face, the lips are prominent with the corners drawn into a line. The nose is straight with the hint of a slight bump and the nostrils are rendered with an energetic cut. The eyes are wider than in the foregoing figure; they are almond-shaped and encircled with a thick black line. A thin red line is drawn from the corners of the eyes to depict the eyelid. There are even short eyelashes shown on the left eye. The eyebrows are slightly arched, with the left brow beginning immediately where the vertical line of the nose ends. On the bridge of the nose there is a small black ring. The hair style and the fillet are practically identical to those of the pre? vious figure. The neck is long, with a horizontal line depicting a fold in the skin. On the left, outstretched hand the affectedly curved fingers are held to? gether in almost the same way as in the previous figure. Between the thumb, which is held apart, and the other fingers there is a vertical cone-shaped rod, of which the bottom part is yellow and the top third painted black (probably a sandalwood torch). In her right hand, which is clenched, the woman holds the stem of a nine-petalled flower. There are also some differences in the clothing. The cut of the collar is rounded. The collar, sleeves and hem are black instead of dark blue, and the rest of the dress is yellowish-brown instead of pink. The cloak is pink on the outside, with a pattern of concentric circles and ovals inscribed in large oval figures. The lapel is yellow with the same design on it. The head of this personage is disproportionately large, and on the whole the figure is larger than the foregoing one. Next comes a seated male figure (fig. 28), drawn on a smaller scale. He is turned three-quarters right. The head is characterized by its pointed chin. The relatively wide eyes are almond-shaped. The upper edge of the upper eyelid is rendered by a peculiar line. The personage is bare-headed, with his black hair done in a peculiar style. A pointed sideburn comes down in front of the ear, while at the temple two broad triangular pieces fall on to the middle of the brow. The lobe of the ear is pierced by an ear-ring. The personage is dressed in a yellow garment, over which is a smooth, closely fitting caftan with a triangular lapel on the left side. The caftan itself is cream-coloured and the lapel black (the lining was black generally), and the sleeves were black below the elbow. The figure was girded at the waist with a composite belt from which, ap? parently, a scarcely visible sword was hanging. His hands were stretched out in front of him. On his right wrist he wore a yellow bracelet, and in the right 57</page><page sequence="24">hand he holds the stem of a flower of the same kind as the one described above. In his outstretched left hand he is holding in his outspread fingers a round object that looks like a yellow ring. His legs are bent at the knees and he is squatting with his buttocks resting on his heels, and his feet drawn under him. Both feet are shown; the sole and the welt of the shoes are black and the upper part yellow. They look very much like galoshes, but it could be the trimming on the bottom of the soft itchigs. In front of this squatting figure there is a standing male figure, a monk (fig. 27). He has a longish oval face and a smallish mouth with the lips parted. The nose is slightly aquiline, with curved lines drawn outwards and downwards from the sides of it to represent the fullness of the cheeks. He has elongated almond-shaped eyes that come to a point at the outer corners. His hair style is the same as that of the previously described male figure. He has a long neck with two short curved lines at the base marking folds in the skin. The figure is slender with a pronounced waist-line. The arms are thin, without the bulging of the muscles. The right arm and shoulder are bare. A dupatt? falls from the left shoulder, and from below it a corner of the greyish-blue undergarment pro? trudes. The dupatt? is pink, with the folds slanting across the torso, and the roundness of the figure is represented by the curved lines. At the hip the folds form an arc following the line of the hip. Here and there on the folds there is a rectangular, honeycomb-like ornament. The dupatt? is rounded at the bottom and is marked by two concentric lines (58). Below it can be seen the straight hem of the undergarment, which is yellow here. The fact that the undergarment is different-coloured at the top and bottom may indicate that it actually con? sists of the uttar?sanga (at the top) and the antarav?saka (59). In his right hand the monk holds the curved stem of a flower to his breast. The feet, which are more in proportion than those of the other standing figures, have the toes out-turned. The figure is wearing black boots with turned-down tops. In front of the monk is a pair of small male figures who sit facing each other; they are even smaller than the previously described seated figure. The one nearest the monk is facing right, and the other one left. Their garments and hair styles are very much like those of the first seated figure. The one on the right is holding a large, shallow, yellow bowl. In the centre of the dish there is a rose-coloured fruit of some sort, and another fruit in the left part of the bowl. (58) ?phis was a late modification of the dupatt?: see G.S. Ghyrya, Indian Costume, Bombay, 1951, pp. 119-20, 137-38. (59) On the use of this type of garment in the Kushan period, see H. Ch. Ackermann, Narrative Stone Reliefs from Gandhara in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, (IsmeoRepMem, XVII), Rome, 1975, pp. 92, 139. 58</page><page sequence="25">Following upon this group comes a large standing male figure. Part of the right arm is preserved and the bottom of the garment. The figure was ap? parently facing right. On the chest and belly and in its lower part the upper garment was yellow with an irregular checked pattern, and the sleeves were white. Below there are visible traces of a pink undergarment. Above and to the left of the figure flames can be seen. Judging from their position, they may come from a torch or a lamp, but it is not clear whether this object was held by the figure in question. Still further to the right of this personage can be seen traces of the body and legs of a seated figure of approximately the same size as the previously described ones. The kneeling figures in the painting at Kalai-Kafirnigan closely resemble the ones from Adzina-Tepa. As is known, Adzina-Tepa yielded a small fragment of a painting showing two kneeling figures holding gold and silver vessels filled with flowers (60). A study of this representation was made at the time by T. I. ZejmaP, and I proposed some alternatives to the interpretation, one of them being that the fragment belonged to a pranidhi scene (61). Scenes with a representation of pranidhi were extremely popular in Bud? dhist art. They are especially typical of the art of Turf an (62). To quote A. Gr?nwedel, at Turfan ? in the narrow passages surrounding the central cellae of the temples and caves, on the sides and at the back, the walls were always painted with representations of legends which tell of the offerings made by some Bodhisattva to a Buddha of the Past. The Buddha, perhaps the K?syapa or Dl pankara, graciously takes the gifts ? flowers or lamps, a garment or an ornament, and at the same time replies to the Bodhisattva, prophesying when he will become a Buddha ?. This is exactly the iconographical solution used for the pra? nidhi scene (63), of which a characteristic feature is the seated figure of the Buddha (64). In Eastern Turkestan pranidhi scenes are complicated compositions made up of many parts, and one of the elements that is most often represented is that of kneeling figures offering gifts, including vessels (65).

The scene at Kalai-Kafirnigan recalls the Eastern Turkestan Stifterbild, a representation of the ceremony during which the founders of the monastery (or temple) bring gifts to the holy place. It goes without saying that this scene was common in the Buddhist monuments of Eastern Turkestan (66). Usually the founders of the religious institutions are represented in half to full natural size and they take up the lower register of the wall painting. They march along one after the other at the head of the monks who hold lamps (calling to mind the pradaksina ceremony), or else they stand still. There are representations of this scene in the corridor, but more often they are on the inside or outside surfaces of the wall where the entrance to the cella was. In the early versions of this scene three large, distinguished personages are shown, with a lady in their midst, and a servant bearing a dish with sacrificial gifts. In the cave in ob)yekt 2 at Kyzyl, on either side of a door, in one case is the king of Kuca with two attendants bearing flowers, and in the other a pro? cession led by monks, where the governor is shown with his wife (the king, the governor and his wife have aureolas). The accompanying inscription tells us that the founder was Anantavarm?, mah?r?jena of Kuca. The custom of rep? resenting the distinguished patrons, the founders of the monasteries, with their entire family survived until later, in Uigurian times (67). Iconographically the two chronological groups of these scenes differ greatly from one another. The earlier ones present a monotonous repetition of like figures with very similar faces; they differ only in the way the arms are drawn and in the details of their clothing. Typical of the later ones is the free com? position and the individual '"portrait" rendering of their faces (68). It is not hard to see that in this respect the painting from Kalai-Kafirnigan occupies an intermediate position, nearer to the later Eastern Turkestan paintings (69). Other parallels to the Eastern Turkestan paintings are also apparent. For instance, the three-quarters position of the personage in the Kalai-Ka (66) Id., ibid., pp. 167-171. Sometimes servants and other personages taking part in the procession are kneeling: see G. Gropp, Arch?ologische Funde aus Chotan, Chinesisch Turkestan, Bremen, 1974, pp. 167-171. (67) A. Gr?nwedel, Alt-Kutscha, Berlin, 1920, pp. 20, 27-29; Gabain, Das Leben..., cit., p. 197. (68) Gr?nwedel, Alt-Kutscha, cit., pp. 28-29. (69) Scenes of the same type showing the offering of gifts to a Bodhisattva or Buddha in the paintings from Ajant? (G. Yazdani, Ajanta. Pt. II. Text, Oxford, 1933, pp. 31-34; Plates, Oxford, 1933, pi. XXXII-XXXIII) show quite different solutions of composition from the painting at Kalai-Kafirnigan. 60</page><page sequence="27">firnigan scene of the gift-bearers may be compared with a similar feature in paintings from Bezeklik: ? A noticeable peculiarity of the Bezeklik paintings is that almost every figure is drawn three-quarter face. Very occasionally a back view is given or a three-quarter back; never a true profile ? (70). In Eastern Turkestan painting many of the personages in the Stifterbild, men and women alike, often hold the stem of a flower in one hand with the flower itself reaching above the shoulder (71), and in the same way as the monk holds a flower in the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting, so too do the monks in the representations showing the founders of the Buddhist sanctuaries from Eastern Turkestan (72). The throne of the Buddha and, to all appearances, the whole "triad" in the upper register of the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting resembles a scene in a wall painting from Khotan (73). The type of male hair-style in the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting finds a close analogy in Eastern Turkestan (74) and at times the likeness comes near to iden? tity (75). Exactly the same type of hair style is found, though very seldom, in sculp? ture (at Tumsuq) (76). In Eastern Turkestan this type of hair style also exists at Miran (77). In Tokharistan, however, it apparently has local origins (78). As far as the female hair styles are concerned, some likeness may be re? marked to a painting at Bamiyan (79), though the resemblance is remote, as is (70) F.H.

Carl, Nouvelles recherches archeologiques ? B?miy?n (MDAFA, III), Paris, 1933, pl. XXVIII) and, rarely, at Ajant? (caves IX, XVII: see G. Yazdani, Ajanta, II. Plates, Oxford, 1946, pl.

In paintings at Kyzyl, turbans are seen on the heads of male figures (81), and usually it is the male figures who wear turbans in the Ajant? paintings (82), although there are, ex? ceptionally, also female head-dresses of this type (83). It is highly likely that in the corridor at Kalai-Kafirnigan the local ruler and his family, the patrons (or founders?) of this temple are shown. We may point to a number of facts which show that at that time the local ruler played such a role. Previously we mentioned Eastern Turkestan, and the same may be said for India (84). In any case, there can be no doubt that the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting shows local ethnic types of inhabitants of Tokharistan, their clothing and ac? cessories. In this regard, the importance of the newly discovered painting as a source can scarcely be over-estimated. It is no less important that the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting with its striking range of colours distinguishes itself for its high artistic merits. Stylistically it is very close to the well known cycle of paintings from Balalyk-Tepe (85), the likeness being notable as a whole and in a number of important details. The lack of strict identity, however, probably depends to a considerable extent on the much later date of the Kalai-Kafirnigan painting, which occupies a position mid? way between the art of Balalyk-Tepe and Adzina-Tepa (86). The building was adorned, as I have already mentioned, not only with paintings, but with clay sculptures as well. One of the large sculptures was found in the southern section of the corridor. Its base was partly contained in the niche in the outer wall of the sanctuary. The block-like base is shaped like an irregular parallelepiped, in plan 1.50 X 0.75 m., height 0.71-0.72 m. Along the front of the top and sides there is a low, plain cornice. In the front corners small quarter-dome niches have been cut out (8T). The surface of the base was coloured. On top of it there was a large seated figure, of which only (80) Le Coq, Buddhistische Sp?tantike.., cit., I, 1922, pi. 18b. (81) A. Le Coq, E.

The Buddha is sitting in padm?s?na, his tightly crossed legs placed one under the other with the bare feet turned upwards. The limbs are modelled with regard for the anatomy, and are covered with a garment whose folds follow the line of the leg, leaving only the feet bare. A gathered part of the garment, with folds that look like concentric rings, pro? trudes from under the legs in the centre. The body of the statue is set back 30 cm. from the front of the pedestal, and the folds, rendered by wide, straight cylinders, fall slantwise on to this space. The left elbow presses against the body and, as far as we can see, the arm is raised upwards. The sangh?ti is red and the feet pink. It is no doubt a large-scale image of the Buddha in dharma cakra-mudr?. The distance between the outermost points of the two knees, cal? culating the missing parts as well, totals 1.55 m. (88). There was another image of a seated Buddha (fig. 22) in the sanctuary, like? wise in the niche, so that the two statues were placed "back to back". This image was considerably smaller than the first one and not so well preserved. Beside it was found the head of a statue, slightly larger than natural size, with a long, narrow face. The large, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes have prominent, swollen upper and lower eyelids that are rendered by narrow rolls. The regular oval of the face narrows towards the short, rounded chin. The nose is high and short and the ends of the upper lip protrude over the lower one. The front edges of the eyelids were drawn in black and the face was coloured white. The head is finely modelled, executed with amazing skill. We have an idealized image of the Buddha, with a half smile hovering on his lips and somewhat downcast eyes. Amongst the other works of sculpture in the sanctuary we shall make men? tion of a head with large eyes and a half-open mouth, and some torsos, including one belonging to a large standing image of a Lokap?la {c. 1.80-2.00 m. in height), with the right leg forward, polychrome colouring, etc. (fig. 24). In addition, the figure of a bird was found in the western section of the corridor. The sculpture from Kalai-Kafirnigan includes some real masterpieces that can be placed on the same artistic level as the finest examples of workmanship from Adzina-Tepa (figs. 30-32). But there is a definite difference: at Kalai-Kafirnigan the images are not simply coloured in a conventional manner. In several cases we observe a much more organic connection between colour and form, and the polychromy renders ornaments, clothing, and so on. In this respect the Kalai-Kafirnigan sculpture resembles not so much the sculpture from Adzina-Tepa (89) as that from Fun (88) At Adzina-Tepa the seated images were smaller: in the image of the Buddha in dharmacakra-mudr? in room 22, the corresponding measurement equalled 110 cm. (Litvin? skij, ZejmaF, op. cit., p. 80). (89) Litvinskij, ZejmaF, op. cit., p. 108. 63</page><page sequence="30">dukistan (90). M. Bussagli has already emphasized the enormous influence that Central Asian art, namely the painting and sculpture from Pendzikent and the painting from Balalyk-Tepe, had on the art of Fundukistan. In his view a "com? plete fusion" of Indian and Central Asian elements is seen in Fundukistan (91). Now Adzina-Tepa and Kalai-Kafirnigan must be added to the '"contributors" to the art of Fundukistan. An extremely interesting comparison can be made with another monument from Afghanistan ? Tapa Sard?r at Ghazni (92). Analogies and links must also be pointed out in Eastern Turkestan. In its general shape the large polychrome torso rather recalls the torsos of Bodhisattvas or devat?s from Sorcuk (93) and Subasi (94), whereas in its polychro my and details it resembles the sculpture from Kumtura (95) and Sorcuk (96). The aforementioned head with large eyes and parted lips finds a comparison in the statues of "genii" from Tumsuq (97) and elsewhere. Almost forty years ago E. Herzfeld, in his study of Sassanian reliefs, called the Eastern Turkestan paintings of scenes with the founders of monasteries ? a replica of the Sasanian sculpture ?. True, he specified straight away: ? There was hardly a direct contact between Iran and Turfan; besides, the Sasanian sculptures are several hundred years older than the Buddhist paintings. The connection is that of a common descent from an older, eastern-Iranian art ? (98). Now this theory of Herzfeld's about the origin of Sassanian art stands in need of some basis amendments (99) as regards the art of Eastern Turkestan, as its Central Asian origins now appear in the foreground, though, of course, it was not only these that determined its genesis. The description of Kalai-Kafirnigan would be incomplete if we did not men? tion the significance of this complex for the genesis of the forms of Central Asian architecture of the high Middle Ages, the so-called "Islamic" architecture.

Now this argument of G. A. Pugacenkova's no longer holds good: such an architectural solution is seen in the Buddhist sanctuary at Kalai-Kafirni? gan, a building that originally stood on its own. A rudimentary "cross-shaped" ground-plan already exists in the square rooms at Kuh-i Hw?ga and this layout must have developed further side by side with the development of the design with four Ivans (102). An elaborate cross-shaped ground plan can be seen in the central room of the 8th-century Christian church at Ak-Besim (103). It is no less important that, in one of the rooms of the temple at Kalai Kafirnigan, we have, in a fully developed form, a system of interpolation be? tween the square ground-plan and the dome, namely squinch arches in the cor? ners with niches between them. This is a very important discovery, for it is the first time that we have been able to establish the pre-Islamic origin of this system. Since we stressed the significance of Buddhist architecture for the formation of the architecture of Central Asian mausoleums (fig. 33) (104), Kalai-Kafirnigan has given new arguments in favour of this thesis. O. Grabar maintained that, generally speaking, the most characteristic fea? ture of "Islamic" art was its "flexibility" in the sense that a rib?t and a caravan? serai have the same layout and the same decorative elements and technique were used for completely different purposes. ? In these cases differences in purpose and use were not established by the monuments but by the activities taking place in them. This primacy of human life and social needs also explains why, from the mosques to stuccoes or to ornament, almost all groups of Islamic monuments were flexible, adaptable to a variety of purposes ? (105). This "flexibility" was undoubtedly a characteristic feature of "Islamic" archi? tecture in its formation too, in Central Asia as well as elsewhere. I have already mentioned the free-standing form and construction of the mediaeval Central Asian mausoleums. However, these features of a genetic like (10?) G.A.

Grabar showed by evidence from the whole "Islamic world" are on ? the simplest levels of techniques and of ^phonetic5 form ? showing that ? practi? cally every decorative motif considered in isolation, every unit of planning, every detail of construction, and every kind of object has a direct prototype in the earlier artistic traditions of the Near East and the Mediterranean ? (106). The situation changes, however, if instead of isolated monuments we take the whole complex of features of early Islamic architecture ? it possesses a highly specific character (107). This thesis must be extended to such types of public buildings as madra? sahs, mausoleums, mosques and caravanserais. There are many who link them with pre-Islamic times ? it is possible to trace the genesis of the decoration, the construction, and the layout (1?8). However, each of the aforesaid types of build? ing, taken in the unity of its architectural, social and ideological aspects, was undoubtedly an essentially new phenomenon, owing its origin to the Middle Ages and typical of that very period (109). And so the discovery of a Buddhist temple at Kalai-Kafirnigan revealed a new, hitherto unknown page in the history of Buddhism in early mediaeval Cen? tral Asia, showing clearly the organic connection between Buddhist and non-Bud? dhist art and architecture. Not only Buddhism as an ideology, but also the cultic buildings and the art connected with this ideology were an important in? tegral part of the culture of the peoples of Central Asia before the advent of Islam, and had a considerable influence on the development of Central Asian ci? vilization of the Islamic period (110).
