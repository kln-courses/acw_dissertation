Boyd-MacMillan 0 School of Psychology, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK b&gt; Psychology and Religion Research Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK Received: 21 May 2007; accepted: 8 December 2007 Abstract To understand better the religious person and religious people, psychology alone is insufficient. Multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approaches are needed too. Encour aged by recent efforts which bring psychology and theology into fuller relationality, we examine further interactions between the two intellectual traditions, and exemplify how each can act hospitably as a critical friend of the other. For example, Lindbeck (1984) theological anthropol ogy can be qualified and expanded through fuller interaction with the psychology of religion and cognitive anthropology. Concurrently, the psychology of religion as a field can be helped to examine its ontological assumptions through fuller engagement with theological accounts of human existence. The psychological understanding of Christian transformation as ego strengthening can be informed, corrected, and expanded to accommodate inescapable ontologi cal claims through theological engagement with object relations theory. While potentially stressful to both disciplines, such collaboration facilitates disciplinary enrichment with benefits beyond the boundaries of either.

Hence, we applaud Reich and others who encourage the psychology of religion to dialogue not simply with the neurosciences but especially with theology and religious studies. Our purpose is to advance this debate. We first consider © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2008 DOI: 10.1163/157361208X316971</page><page sequence="2">94 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 general issues raised by the fiduciary and intellectual position of the investiga tor, and progress made in bringing the two disciplines into conversation. Next, we ask whether psychology and theology can be viewed as potentially com mensurable and mutually hospitable disciplines. Finally, we exemplify how theology and psychology can assist each other, through psychology acting as theology's critical friend, or by theology clarifying the basis of key psychologi cal constructs and offering a higher order treatment of one of these, the ego. Beginning the Dialogue: Engagement and Understanding Academic disciplines are not abstract de-personalised endeavours; they are tra ditions with distinctive rationalities, virtues and practices, which co-implicate their practitioners. In psychology of religion and theology, academic investiga tors seek explanation and understanding as either insiders or outsiders. The psychology of religion can be pursued from a more internalised, engaged per spective, whose goal is understanding (Verstehen), or as a third-person, objec tive enterprise, whose goal is explanation (Erklären) (Reich, 2000). Similarly, atheists and agnostics can and have become as skilled in handling theological concepts as religious believers. In both disciplines, 'investigators' sometimes begin as insiders (believers) and end as outsiders (non-believers), or vice versa (e.g. Cupitt, 1980, 1985). Some believer-theologians maintain that theology can be carried out dispassionately or 'objectively' in a third-person way, rather like psychologists of religion operating 'from the outside' (Pannenberg, 1985). Others claim that a full engagement with theology is possible only from within a belief system or confessional context; they argue that theological thinking and creativity is itself shaped by its subject matter. Prayerful engagement with the primary object of study, God, enables theologians to achieve greater insight (see D'Costa, 2005 for an informed and informative discussion of this whole issue). Understandably, there can be suspicions of lack of objectivity toward those investigating as 'insiders' or 'believers'. Similarly, those who investigate as non-believers may find themselves accused of failing to appreciate the "lived experience." Complex though they both are, psychology and theology nevertheless over lap in their mutual interest in the person. They also share many philosophical ancestors. But here the simplicity of their relationship ends. Not only do psy chology and theology differentially implicate issues of personal engagement, and begin with different ontological assumptions, but the space where they conduct their relationship might aptly be described as Timinal.' It is a space</page><page sequence="3">P. J. Hampson et al. /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 95 akin to an airport transit area, airside, or a ship on the ocean, where cultures, laws, customs and practices of the lands on each side of the journey do not apply unequivocally. Travellers through liminal places frequently feel dislo cated, alienated, vulnerable, if not completely "at sea." Such spaces can yield tremendous therapeutic insight and wisdom, but often with accompanying stress and pain (Turner, 1969). Similar stressful yet productive experiences of liminality seem to occur with interacting disciplines which raise not merely epistemic questions but issues of personal commitment, affect, social interaction and intellectual citizenship too. Unsurprisingly, therefore, researchers in psychology of religion often first acknowledge, then distance themselves from the religious commitments explored, noting, for example, that a "neuropsychological analysis of theology or mysticism" does not alter "their true spiritual and possibly transcendent nature" (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg, 1999, p. 176), or that "(s)ocial scientific meth ods cannot determine the ontological origin of the sacred... but can help us understand how people perceive the sacred or sacralize their lives and contexts" (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, p. 156). Volumes by psychologists and theologians (sometimes the same person) respectfully relate the disciplines and increase our understanding of forgiveness, spiritual transformation, faith development, and so on (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2003). Noting historical hostili ties between psychology and religion/theology, they then acknowledge recent productive rapprochement (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, pp. 16-17, 162). They identify conceptual and linguistic differences between, say, spirituality and self-consciousness (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, p. 61, n. 58), sometimes ventur ing cross-referenced compatible interpretations while maintaining explanatory distinctiveness. But, despite challenges, recent collaborative efforts are yielding powerful integrations of psychological and spiritual measures of well-being and matu rity, with mystical spirituality classics, empirical psychological research on religion, and theological reflection (Benner, 1998; Shults &amp; Sandage, 2003, 2006). Both present authors have called for more such collaboration, even though such broad integration involves intellectual risk (Boyd-MacMillan, 2004, 2006; Hampson, 2005a, b; see also Dueck &amp; Lee, 2005; Watts, 2002). Through such collaborative efforts we now have greater insight into the human dynamics of spiritual formation, well-being and maturity, into various virtues, and into the physiological correlates of various types of religious commitment (e.g., Kramer, 2000; Paloutzian &amp; Ellison, 1982; Park, Peterson, &amp; Seligman, 2004; Sandage, 1999; Schipani, 2003; Sloan &amp; Bagiella, 2002; Tix &amp; Frazier, 2005). We also understand better the complexity of religious commitments,</page><page sequence="4">96 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 and the limits of some empirical methodologies are also clearer; for example, self-reported and observer reports of holiness do not always correspond (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, p. 188). So, theology and psychology co-operate already. As Shults and Sandage indicate: "The relation between our disciplines is important because they already influence each other, whether we like it or not!" (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, p. 23, italics original). Despite this, some may remain unaware or suspicious of such collaboration. With this group chiefly in mind, we explore in more detail the possibilities for reciprocal interactions between psychology and theology. To do so we use key insights of the moral philosopher Alasdair Maclntyre (see Murphy, 2005a for a complementary use of Maclntyre's ideas). We illustrate how psychology act ing as theology's critical friend can assist in critiquing and re-constructing theology's unique understanding of the person, its theological anthropologies. We focus particularly on the theological anthropology underpinning a recent, influential, account of doctrine (Lindbeck, 1984). Finally, perhaps even more controversial for psychology, we examine how theology can inform and enhance the psychology of religion. We consider how theology can help psy chology identify and potentially resolve some of its epistemic crises, especially psychology's ontological blind-spots. We show how theology has direct impli cations for the concept of ego-strengthening, and develop the idea that the ego undergoing spiritual maturation functions analogously to a transitional object. One important working assumption is that there are no a priori grounds (in advance of mature engagement and interdisciplinary discussion) which legiti mate a given discipline merely to assert its rational superiority over another and expect to be heeded by it. We accept the possibility in principle of explana tions and understandings transcending the local particularities of disciplines, and toward which, we maintain, trans-disciplinary enquiry should aim (Hampson, 2006). We agree again with Reich (this volume) that a relational and contextual logic (RCR), which permits complementary explanations, is preferable to one which applies standard, two-valued logic, in a simple, "knock-out" way when dealing with interdisciplinary issues (see also Loder &amp; Neidhart, 1992). But we also believe, as should be clear from the above, that interdisciplinary relationships between psychology and theology can move beyond compatibilism to a hospitably mutual engagement, critique and syn ergy (Boyd-MacMillan, 2004, 2006; Hampson, 2005a, b; 2006; see also Hill, 1999; Jones, 1994). Intellectual traditions, like theology or psychology, provide the nurturing intellectual and interpersonal environments where the personal dynamics of</page><page sequence="5">P. J. Hampson et al. ! Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 97 knowing are formed and function (Hart, 2005; see also Grene, 1972; Polanyi, 1958). Traditions therefore permit as well as restrict possibilities for disciplin ary and interdisciplinary understanding. Our last assumption, then, is that interdisciplinary debate across traditions is best accomplished by those who understand the language of their rival tradition, and who have indwelt both sufficiently to have become acceptably 'proficient' if not completely 'fluent' in their languages and comfortable in both cultures. Speaking French does not automatically guarantee full access to and comprehension of French culture, cuisine or communal life, whereas visiting and living in France and meeting the people helps considerably. Theology and Psychology as Rival but Commensurable Traditions Where two disciplines overlap in their concerns, bringing them into dialogue might be thought straightforward. In practice they are unlikely to coincide in a) their presuppositions, b) their concepts and content, c) their methods and d) their ethical and moral implications. In other words, their overall practices and standards may not be coincident regarding what they deem to be ratio nally open to assertion. Each proclaims its findings as true from within its frame of reference, thereby vindicating its approach; yet neither can attain any tradition-independent vantage from which to view or critique the other. There are, then, two opposing, common dangers here. One is to assume that a given discipline is de facto privileged in its truth claims over against another, that it and it alone has access to some universal, observer-independent rationality. The other is to acknowledge that only what can be claimed from within a tradition of enquiry has any validity, leaving no alternative but to embrace the relativism of all such truth claims. Maclntyre (1984, 1988, 1992) has considered this issue in depth. Rather than bringing this or that particular discipline into dialogue with another, he has analysed the rationalities of intellectual traditions and the problem of inter-tradition dialogue in general. Bretherton (2006) puts it well: Maclntyre develops a first order account of how... thought and action is constituted by a tradition and how such a tradition is incommensurable with other traditions... He (then) sets out a second order meta-theory for how different traditions can, over time, resolve disputes. His meta-theory seeks to steer between the Scylla of relativism and the Charybdis of positing some universally human and culturally neutral grounds for adjudicating between incommensurable tradition (2006, p. 3, parenthetical mate rial added).</page><page sequence="6">98 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 30 (2008) 93-113 Different standards of rationality do not, in Maclntyre's view, inevitably cut off traditions one from another. Although intellectual traditions may lapse into incommensurability, as did, say, theology and psychology during the behaviourist period, traditions can successfully achieve mutual comprehen sion. For Maclntyre, therefore, the possibility of translatability across two or more traditions does arise. Such translation raises familiar problems of seman tic and syntactic mismatches across languages, and the colouring effects of language on perception and thought, but it can be accomplished, at least by those schooled in the relevant traditions, skilled in their relevant languages, and suffused with fiduciary commitments in and to them. Where pre-conditions of commensurability and translatability obtain, Maclntyre suggests that traditions are most open to critical influence from their rivals when they suffer epistemic crises which they cannot resolve unaided. Acknowledging such crises affords them the best opportunities to develop and restructure; crises are points of potential growth not weakness. A tradition can successfully critique a rival if, when its rival fails, it supplies explanations for its rival's failure and proffers alternatives meeting the rival traditions internal standards. Somewhat combatively, the rival tradition is then said to have been "defeated." It can then begin to accept and potentially incorporate the wider claims of its defeater (cf. Maclntyre, 1992). While strongly endorsing Maclntyre's overall approach we wish to qualify it somewhat. The affective, social and, we also suggest, ethical issues involved in interdisciplinary collaboration temper our use of the term rival traditions. All too easily "rival" connotes conflict, contest or power struggle. That is not, we think, what we should be about. We prefer to adopt Bretherton's (2006) rec ommendation that talk and practices of rivalry, grudging tolerance, and intel lectual "superiority," be replaced with the older notion of "hospitality." Hospitality entails opening one's household to the guest, feasting with them as equals, and being concerned with their flourishing, even when disagreeing radically with their ideas. This, we suggest, is how psychology and theology should best behave toward each other: by opening their doors, whether for reasons derived from good, humanist, psychological ethics or from a more theistically grounded morality. Thus, psychology can hospitably critique and help re-construct the psycho logical aspects of the anthropologies deployed by theology. In turn, psychol ogy can be critiqued and contextualised by theology, but a word of caution is in order. Although theology's primary concern is the Divine it also considers the person and the human condition. So does this common emphasis on the</page><page sequence="7">P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 99 human legitimate psychology to assume its primacy in the ensuing conversa tion as critical friend? In fact the situation is not so straightforward. Theology is concerned largely with the ontology of personhood, what people are, and what they are for, whereas psychology is typically interested in how people function. This results in two curiously complementary biases: psychology is frequently blind to ontological accounts, or implicitly accepting of them with out careful examination, especially when they do not challenge its functional specifications; theology, by contrast, can make unfounded functional assump tions, especially where these cohere with its ontologies, or embed unacknowl edged or culturally derived views of psychological systems or processes. So, when maintaining that psychology can act as theology's critical friend, or that theology can critique psychology, we must remain alert to both the scope and limits of engagement in each direction, and to problems arising when extrapo lating from limited theologies and psychologies. Psychology as the Critical Friend of Theology How can psychology help theology review the validity of its anthropologies? One example is theology's concern with the self. A common theological assumption is that the so called "divided" self is psychopathological since it is a consequence of sin or the fallen state, in contrast the "integrated" or "unified" self is assumed to characterise the holy or sinless state and psychological whole ness. Turner (2004) has challenged this supposition. While negative language about the divided self can be biblical (e.g., Mt 12.26, 1 Cor. 7.34), it need not imply that the multiple self is necessarily psycho-pathological. Considering sociological and psychological accounts of the self, Turner argues that some forms of self multiplicity are inevitable, indeed perhaps helpful, and not psy chopathological. Distinguishing between the experience of self and the repre sented or conceptualised self, he suggests that representational multiplicity is natural and to some extent desirable, whether synchronic or diachronic. After all, I think differently about myself now than I did ten years ago, and my cur rent concept as self-as-a-parent, or spouse, is different from my concept of self-as-a-psychologist. Similarly there is little or nothing untoward in the fact that diachronically the self may be experienced as multiple. I do not feel as I did ten years ago. Whereas, the synchronic experience of self is normally unified, setting aside such cases as multiple personality disorder. This careful analysis of the logic and dynamics of selfhood does not challenge the concepts</page><page sequence="8">100 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 of sin or holiness as such, nor the unity of personhood (see Turner, 2007), but it does challenge accounts which too readily assert the formal equivalence of psychological wholeness and holiness. More generally, it vindicates a transdis ciplinary approach which rejects any premature reduction of concepts across disciplines despite the seductive quality of shared terminology. Elsewhere, psychology's critical stance has deeper implications for theology, as when challenging a theological anthropology from which further claims have been made, for instance about religious language and doctrine. Consider Lindbeck (1984) influential, theological monograph The Nature of Doctrine where he distinguishes his own cultural linguistic view of doctrine from so called cognitive-propositional and experiential-expressive approaches. The prepositional approach is the realist, common sense position where doctrinal statements (propositions) are assumed to correspond to and make truth claims about some putative religious reality. The experiential-expressive approach, by contrast, treats religious statements as more expressive of affect or attitude, more like the denotation of a deeply felt religious feeling, than the articulation of a set of verbal beliefs. According to Lindbeck, "the 'experiential-expressive' dimension... interprets doctrines as noninformative and nondiscursive symbols of inner feelings, attitudes, or existential orienta tions" (Lindbeck, 1984, p. 16). Instead, he suggests, religions "... resemble languages together with their correlative forms of life and are thus similar to cultures (insofar as these are understood semiotically as reality and value systems, that is, as idioms for the constructing of reality and the living of life)" (1984, p. 18). Lindbeck views the person as a product of a cultural-linguistic system, who effectively is using religious language (in a quasi-Wittgensteinian way) within certain forms of life. He lays more stress on the narrative consistency of religious language, rather than emphasising its role in picking out any abiding religious reality. Lindbeck further distinguishes religion, as a first-order activity, from second order reflections on that activity, such as doctrine. He defines doctrine in terms of a second order regulative account of religious language; doctrine functions as a type of "grammar" governing the admissibility or otherwise of religious statements. Some straightforward psychological challenges to Lindbeck's (1984) under lying theological anthropology have immediate consequences for his theory of doctrine (Hampson, 2006). In general, he over-asserts the primacy of lan guage, or more accurately of cultural signs, but, arguably, underplays the importance of embodiment, mimesis, development, history and symbolic cul ture, as well as the subtleties of cognition and its links with affect. Thus, work</page><page sequence="9">P. J. Hampson et al. /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 101 in cultural psychology, cognitive anthropology and the cognitive psychology of religion easily qualifies Lindbeck's anthropology. Take for instance Donalds claims that consciousness involves episodic, mimetic, narrative and symbolic levels (Donald, 2001). The symbolic and nar rative levels of consciousness depend, for Donald, ontogenetically and phylo genetically, on psychologically more "basic" narrative, mimetic and episodic abilities. So, the metaphoric structures of mimesis is recapitulated at the nar rative level, grounding language, of whatever sort, closer to our embodiment and emplacement in a real, spatio-temporal nexus than Lindbeck acknowl edges (see also Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1999). Likewise, cultural symbolic products and distilled meanings accumulate across time and generations, such as the Jewish celebration of Passover with its call to remembrance, or the compila tion of the canon of Scripture. Donald acknowledges this diachronic or his torical aspect of being human, which shapes our consciousness in general, unlike Lindbeck, who studiously ignores it. Or consider how imagistic and doctrinal religious modes can be distin guished and linked with episodic and semantic memory systems respectively (Whitehouse, 2004 [(Copy Editor's query: I cannot find reference to this author in Bibliography: please insert)]). Together with Donalds work, White house's can be used to construct a richer, more inclusive theological anthropol ogy than Lindbeck's, one wide enough to encompass the representational flexibility of the religious thinker, thereby enriching our diachronic under standing of religious cognition. Finally, Lindbeck has already been criticized within theology for adopting too restricted a view of the "cognitive" in his discussion of the cognitive-prop ositional approach by treating cognitive as explicit, conscious and verbal (e.g. McGrath, 2002, p. 44, fn 92). Cognitive psychology supports and extends this criticism and reveals two clearly distinguishable types of information processing: one "hot" cognition, fast, affect-laden, inferential and probably non-conscious, the other, slower, more propositional and possibly conscious. Recently, Gib son (2005) has shown both types to be implicated in judgments about God by adapting a self-reference paradigm to investigate the accessibility of God schémas and self schémas in various groups including evangelical and non evangelical Christians and atheists. Although evangelical and non-evangelical explicit accounts of God did not differ markedly, reaction time patterns of evangelicals suggested that their underlying, non-conscious, God schémas were "better elaborated, more efficient and more affect laden" (p. vi) than non evangelicals. Atheists, by contrast, appeared to use two different concepts of God but had underlying God schémas which were "poorly elaborated,</page><page sequence="10">102 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 inefficient and affect free" (p. vi). Gibson himself acknowledges that his data can be variously interpreted, but they do make clear the multi-faceted quality of religious knowing, in particular the existence of both a slow conscious, prepositional and a faster, more affect-based mode. Together, these examples show that any simple account of religious cognition based solely on the cognitive-prepositional, or on the experiential-expressive, or the cultural linguistic and then used to underpin theories of doctrine looks increasingly implausible (cf. Watts, in press). Theology on Psychology: Epistemic Crises and Ego-Transitions But can theology influence psychology? To begin, psychology is largely opaque as to its embedded ontologies (though see Harré, 2002). Psychology's sub scription to methodological naturalism, materialist or relational, frequently coincides with an implicit, philosophical naturalism (although this is neither necessary nor inevitable). Generally this need not matter; it probably does not and certainly should not affect psychology's methods. But psychology's tacit philosophical atheism may prevent it from deeper engagement with theology's truth claims, leaving psychology philosophically exposed. This is the case par ticularly, but not exclusively, for the psychology of religion, With its longer vantage, theology easily diagnoses psychology's ontological limitations as resulting from psychology's later emergence from post Enlight enment philosophy. Theology's "cure" invites psychology to consider a longer, shared, philosophical history and to make aware (and reconsider) psychology's ontologies. Sympathetic reading of works such as Daviess Theology of Compas sion with its discussion of the doctrine of the Imago Dei, for example, invites psychology to consider how compassion affects the self-in-relation, and the person's ultimate ontological grounding (Davies, 2001). Or consider James Loders suggestion that the person is situated not only in relation to the world, themselves and other persons, but also to the nothingness of the void (the threat of death or non-existence, the absence of being) and the Holy. Yet these latter two dimensions of personhood, he maintained, are frequently ignored by the human sciences and repressed by secular culture at large (Loder, 1989, pp. 80-85). But suppose psychology were more routinely to consider awareness of the void and mortality (let alone the Holy) as important constituents of human psychology. What might follow? Issues of our mutual vulnerability and inter dependence as rational yet dependent animals would arise, and the virtues of acknowledged dependence needed to counterbalance the virtues of independent</page><page sequence="11">P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 103 rational agency would come into focus (cf. Maclntyre, 1999). This critique, only recently impinging on moral philosophy, has yet to impact on psychol ogy, but its influence could be considerable, as an alternative to the more typical, "rule-based," psychological theories of moral behaviour. We now turn to our final example: how theology might influence psychol ogy in its understanding of the role of ego-strengthening in spiritual transfor mation. We consider Christian spiritual growth and maturation specifically, thereby sidestepping debates in religious studies and the psychology of reli gion on the similarities and dissimilarities of personal transformation among various religions. Our discussion has thus been a journey of intensification, moving from outside the disciplines to standing within psychology, to looking finally at one of psychology's constructs (the ego) from within theol ogy as believers who affirm the existence of God and key Christian theologi cal ideas. Overall, our theological stance coincides with, rather than replaces, our stance as psychological "believers," as should be evident from what has preceded. Psychological examination of Christian transformation as a whole-person reorientation that is both episodic, with defining moments or events, and pro cess, with underlying, slow and continuous changes (seeTable 1), can take the form of exploring the intersection of psychological and spiritual well-being and maturity. Usually such exploration highlights the role of ego strengthening. Research finds strong correlations among ego-strength, differentiation, and socio cognitive maturity (e.g. Bauer, MacAdams, &amp; Sakaeda, 2005). Spiritual matu rity can be understood as "a relational spirituality of differentiated attachment" (Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, p. 269, italics original) in which ego strength facili tates inter-personal relationships and manages personal fears of absorption or abandonment. However, operating as a critical friend in the shared pursuit of truth, theology questions ego strengthening as an adequate concept for Chris tian transformation and suggests instead the construct of ego as a transitional object in human-divine relationship. The suggestion that there is such a thing as human-divine relationship invites an analogy with human relationships (see Reich, 2003). Human rela tionships are both similar to and different from human-divine relationship. In theology, this is taken for granted: human beings are creatures and creaturely relationships cannot help but differ from the relationship between creature and Creator. Moreover, theology acknowledges that our statements about God are always limited since language inherently limits what is infinite, speaking about what is ultimately ineffable (see comparisons of metaphor and analogy in scientific and theological discourse in Soskice, 1985).</page><page sequence="12">104 P.

The disciplinary bias of psychology may still suggest that human-divine relationship is illusory, however benign. Be that as it may, it is reasonable to start with the familiar (human-human rela tionships), and the centre of Christian transformation is a Being who is under stood as fully human as well as fully divine. In this way, psychological inquiry has stayed safely within the human realm. Yet the danger in not expanding our horizons to include the divinity of Christ as well as Christ's humanity, that is the divine partner in the relationship as well as the human, is that the psycho logical hermeneutic may remain unnecessarily partial even in the purely func tional realm. While some have tried to construct a theoretical approach that allows for divine reality (Swinton, pp. 84-86, citing Levin, 1996, and Larson, Swyers, &amp; McCullough, 1997), thereby expanding a purely functional approach, it remains more or less unexplored territory. Whether as researchers or participants, we often extrapolate from human development and from purely human relation ships, as if human-divine relationship and its effects, insofar as they are benign, are simply more of a good thing, and even theologically sophisticated partici pants, in certain experimental settings, continue to make anthropomorphic projections and comparisons (e.g. Barrett, 2004). While this is fine, it misses crucial aspects of human-divine relationship and its effects as described by those who claim to know personally about such things. In Christian transformation, the divine Other sets the relationship on analogous yet completely different ground (Loder, 1998).</page><page sequence="14">106 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 In the liminal space that is home to inter-disciplinary inquiry, then, we need to risk the stressful topic of God—stressful, that is, for the naturalism of psychology—and to consider what difference it makes that the Other in Chris tian transformation is God and not another human being. Christian theology offers vital information to psychology in this endeavour. Theologically, God is understood as the Source of all that is, even of the human being who is the other part of the relationship in the process we call Christian transformation. This dependency sets apart this relationship from any other, not in empirical type or degree but in ontological kind. The closest we can come to understanding such a relationship humanly speaking might be a mother pregnant with a child for nine months who then gives birth to a sepa rate human being. From a theological perspective, all human beings at all times and everywhere remain dependent on God for their existence. Human beings are highly complex and mysterious, yet the complexity and mystery of God is again a difference in kind not type. For purely human relationships our ego is an adequate psychological con struct for talking about the "I," the part of ourselves that negotiates our inner and outer worlds, and that navigates our relationships. The term conveys this sense of ourselves, while we bear in mind cross-cultural (and other) concerns that alert us to its limitations. In the human-divine relationship, however, the limitations of the human ego are revealed, literally and conceptually. In human relationships, the ego operates through spatial and temporal con straints and boundaries, and exercises some control, whereas human-divine relationship draws and invites the ego into a realm that transcends space-time boundaries, and involves surrender. The result is neither a major increase in ego strength, nor the supervenient layering of one set of empirical properties on another (cf. Haldane, 2004, p. 88), but a bridging of finitude and infinity. The person now lives intentionally in a liminal space of constraints and transcendence (indicating the appropriateness of inter- and trans-disciplinary inquiry). The traditional phrasing of being "conformed to Christ" (Romans 8.29) refers to the Christian understanding that these realms are brought together in their personhood. At this juncture the reader may protest that there are no externally measur able or qualitatively discernable psychological consequences of this process. We disagree. In the pursuit of even purely psychological truth in the matter of Christian transformation, investigators need to include these three "variables": 1) the nature of the relationship as described, whether human-human or human-divine; 2) whether the participant in the study is a believer or non believer; and 3) the existence or non-existence of God. Even purely psycho</page><page sequence="15">P. J. Hampson et al. /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 107 logical research will be affected if these variables are operative, interactive (with any discernable psychological effects), and involve further theological claims. Psychology may find it easier to countenance the role of the first two, the rela tionship (real or imagined) and the participant's fiduciary commitments, while remaining agnostic as to the last, the role of God. Yet this is precisely where we suspect a rich and hospitable dialogue with theology can help psychology in not only establishing the limits but also the full extent of its explanatory pos sibilities, without any attendant threat to its (psychology's) basic methodolog ical autonomy. At the very least, however, and to make progress, we suggest that psychology needs to appreciate that, prima facie, Christian self-reported effects differ markedly and qualitatively from the usual self-reported effects of ego strength ening. As philosopher John Haldane puts it when discussing religious lan guage in general, "such ways of talking... are value sensitive. They express a range of views of how things are that is only available to one who can adopt a certain evaluative-cum-spiritual perspective on the world" (Haldane, 2004, p. 106). This bridging of the spiritual and temporal realms is crucial to Chris tian identity: living in the world while not being of it (John 17). Thus, for research on Christian transformation to have any credibility among Christian believers, a "thick" description is needed that is recognizable among believers themselves, and which includes not only this bridging element, but denotes and permits the possibility of a paradoxical transformation of the ego (a strength through vulnerability, Coakley, 2002, pp. 3-39) that is not the same as the ego-strengthening of usual human development. How might we express this? In Christian transformation, the ego is the same ego, even more deeply itself, but also deeply changed. It is more deeply itself in terms of self-knowledge (of its meaning and purpose). It is deeply changed though its acceptance of limita tions, awareness of freedoms through human-divine relationship, and embrace of deep connection with the world in which it lives. The ego-strengthening of human development also involves greater self-knowledge and enhanced com petencies, but the fundamental functioning of the ego remains the same in classic ego psychology. It is what neo-Jungian psychologist James Hillman calls "heroic," to convey the dominating, controlling, conquering nature of the strong ego (Hillman, 1973). In the ego, the strengthening, preparatory, and relativising life-long pro cesses can intertwine. Psychologically, the ideal is an ego that strengthens throughout life. Theologically, this ego, as transitional object, persistently primes the human psyche for human-divine relationship; God is infinite and</page><page sequence="16">108 P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 always offering more. As someone responds to God's offer, their ego is relativ ised continually. Human-divine relationship effects a power in vulnerability, exemplified by Jesus Christ (theologically termed kenosis or self-emptying, cf. Davies, 2001), and the ego is uniquely strengthened in a way that includes a transcendent or divine aspect (see also Murphy, 2005b). To avoid confusion, encourage fuller investigation, and produce a "thicker" description, a term other than "ego strengthening" is required. While the chal lenge facing psychology here as it investigates Christian transformation is for midable, as a critical friend theology offers help from centuries of wrestling with the difficulties of speaking about a process that is both natural and not natural. Natural, biological, cognitive and emotional processes are involved and yet our whole personhood is re-orientated (cf. Balswick, King, &amp; Reimer, 2005, p. 273). Rather than appropriating the language of ego strengthening, then, the language of object relations might take us closer to the truth. The psychoanalytic school of Object Relations with its theory of transi tional objects focuses on humans' relational drive. A transitional object (Win nicott, 1953) is both discovered and created; the child discovers the raw materials in her environment and imagination and creates the object that helps her through an anxious, fearful time, to the next developmental level. Usually children discard the transitional object as they internalize the safety and reas surance that the object represents. In Christian transformation, the ego enables a person to enter into relationship with God and then assumes a similar role, but with an ontological difference: the ego still negotiates our inner and outer worlds, but from a dialectical relationship with God. Perhaps, therefore, we should think of the ego as a transitional object, one that heroically takes us into uncharted territories, and then is itself transformed by virtue of being in that unfamiliar terrain. Transitional objects represent safety and reassurance through their familiar ity and manageability. We are never, however, totally safe to ourselves; we can be unfathomable, unpredictable, and even unfamiliar. Managing our egos may be a full-time occupation, but never completely achievable. One cannot choose not to carry one's ego into a particular situation, as the Peanuts cartoon character Linus can choose to leave his blanket (a common transitional object). We can merely choose to show different parts of ourselves in varying situa tions. Similarly and yet differently, we can choose to embrace human-divine relationality, no longer hiding under the ego blanket. There may be engage ment with God without intention, but Christian transformation that is conscious and explicit involves intentional ego-engagement from the human participant.</page><page sequence="17">P. J. Hampson et al. / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 93-113 109 While a strong competent ego supports psychological well-being and indi cates psychological maturity, its absence does not prevent relationality with God. Wholeness and holiness can and do overlap (cf. Savage &amp; Boyd-MacMillan, 2007, ch. 9), yet Christian transformation does not depend on wholeness. One may distinguish mental health problems from an overall mental health continuum that includes a persons ability to access spiritual resources; this ability, a mark of holiness, does not require the absence of mental health prob lems, or, the presence of "wholeness" (Swinton, 2001, pp. 59-60). Further more, people with mental health problems can impress and instruct their long-term carers with their holiness even while their lack of wholeness renders them unable to cope without substantial assistance (Balswick, King, &amp; Reimer, 2005, p. 260; Reimer &amp; Walker, 2004). In the dialectical process that yields personal knowledge (see Shults &amp; Sandage, 2006, pp. 108-111), Christian transformation restructures one's dialectical identity (self and self, self and other). The "other" now includes the nothingness of the void and the Holy. Tacit or background awareness of the void and Holy becomes explicit knowledge of a fundamental dependency that yields a transforming personal 'power in vulnerability'. Theologically, two thousand years of qualitative data testify to this radical restructuring or shift in identity (St. Paul e.g., Galatians 3.23, Colossians 1.21-23; Augustine in his Confessions; see also the writings of Hildegard von Bingen, William of St. Thierry, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Meister Eckhart; and see Loder, 1998, e.g., p. 58). Each discipline needs the other to do justice to these data. Conclusion We propose that theology and psychology can be hospitable to one another as critical friends. We acknowledge and applaud such work to date and invite further and ever more challenging collaboration. As disciplines seeking to understand as much as to explain, they can inform, correct, and expand one another. In the study of doctrine, inadequate anthropologies are easily unmasked. In the area of Christian transformation, theology not only offers resources but works with psychological concepts to deepen understanding of a process with inescapable ontological claims. These offerings facilitate mutual disciplinary growth, rather than signify weakness. Such hospitality can stress either discipline, but can also produce research significant to those inside and outside either discipline.</page><page sequence="18">110 P. J.
