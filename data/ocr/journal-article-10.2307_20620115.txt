There is little agreement about where, indeed, even if, we should draw a firm line demarcating conscious awareness (that is, phenomenal awareness, subjectivity, what-it-is-like-ness) from nonconscious zombiehood (what Ned Block calls "access" consciousness).1 I will assume that the solu tion to what Michael Tye calls the "problem of simple minds" and what Peter Carruthers calls the "distribution problem," does not re quire us to conceive of consciousness as a graded or "penumbral" phenomenon.2 Tye is on the right track when he writes that "[some where down the phylogenetic scale phenomenal consciousness ceases. But where?" (op. cit, p. 171). That is a tough question, though per haps not intractable. I want to sketch an empirically driven proposal for removing some puzzlement about the distribution of conscious ness in the animal world. Perhaps we can make progress on Tye's question by exploiting analogues between the residual abilities found in the dissociative condition known as "blindsight," and the visual and other sensory functions in certain animals. I want to develop the idea that we can distinguish conscious from nonconscious awareness * Ancestors of this paper benefited from the insight and criticism of Bill Scager, Ronald de Sousa, Peter W.

I will structure my discussion around the "representationalist" the ory of consciousness. This is the view that the subjective character of an experience is completely exhausted by its representational con tent.4 Representationalism maintains that for any given pair of sub jective experiences there can be no qualitative difference without a difference in representational content; in other words, representional identities imply qualia identities. Representationalism is far from assured in the minds of many philosophers. One need only witness Tye's responses to many putative counterexamples to appreciate the breadth of skepticism about the central representationalist thesis.5 I shall leave this controversy aside and assume that qualia states can (at least) be tracked by way of their representational contents.6 The next question is: What does representationalism have to say about the problem of simple minds? Representationalism comes in two main varieties, known as the "first order thought" (FOT) and the "higher-order thought" (HOT) theories of phenomenal consciousness. These share the assumption that con scious representations (especially "analog" or "rough-grained" sensory representations) are those that make a direct impact on an organism's cognitive system: typically by leading to the construction of first-order belief (for example, representations about features of the environ ment), or higher-order belief (in which another mental state, such as 3 The claim here is that certain animals might possess phenomenally "blind" ana logues of other modes of sensory consciousness, including touch, smell, and hearing (see footnote 70). 4 See Fred Dretske, Naturalizing the Mind (Cambridge: MIT, 1995); Robert Kirk, Raw Feeling: A Philosophical Account of the Essence of Consciousness (New York: Oxford, 1994); Tye, Ten Problems of Consciousness: A Representational Theory of the Phenomenal Mind (Cam bridge: MIT, 1995). 0 See Tye, "Visual Qualia and Visual Content Revisited," in David Chalmers, ed., Phi losophy of Mind: Classic and Contemporary Readings (New York: Oxford, 2002), pp. 447-56. Tye considers counterexamples offered by Block in his review of Daniel Dennett's Con sciousness Explained (see Block, this journal, xc, 4 (April 1993): 181-93), and still more counterexamples in "Blurry Images, Double Vision, and Other Oddities: New Problems for Representationalism?" in Quentin Smith and Aleksandar Jokic, eds., Consciousness: New Philosophical Perspectives (New York: Oxford, 2003), pp. 7-32. 6 One challenge for the representationalist comes in the form of qualia-inversion/ absence thought experiments. Those who find such thought experiments plausible, and who also agree that qualia supervene "locally" on a subject's brain states will be natural enemies of representationalism. In short, if it is possible that there can be qualia differences in the absence of differences in the local causal role of sensory representa tions, then representationalism is false, unless perhaps one abandons the idea that qua lia are intrinsic (as does Tye). I prefer to accept that qualia are intrinsic, and so deny the real possibility of absent and inverted qualia.</page><page sequence="3">SIMPLE MINDS 391 a first-order belief, is taken as the representational content). It is highly implausible that nonmammals and invertebrates possess higher-order representational abilities, so higher-order theories seem to imply straightforwardly that there is nothing that it is like to be a fish, am phibian, lizard, insect, and the like.7 The FOT theory, however, re quires a more subtle assessment. Several explications of the FOT theory claim that many animals, even insects, have states of conscious awareness. However, I will argue that this version of representationalism, especially as conceived by Dretske (op. cit.) and Tye8 faces a dilemma. The dilemma turns on the following question: Are organisms such as insects, and "lower" ver tebrates first-order thinkers; that is, can they entertain first-order be liefs and desires? This is a controversial question, however, I will argue that it makes no difference whether or not we decide to call their cog nizing "thought." For if they cannot entertain first-order thoughts, then of course the FOT theory entails they are not conscious, and we end up with a skeptical answer to the simple minds problem. How ever, even if they do possess first-order thought, it is still very unlikely that they are conscious. The reason is because the cognitive "style" of these organisms is so strikingly similar to cognition in blindsight sub jects. In short, if cognition in these simple-minded organisms counts as first-order thought, then cognition in blindsight plausibly might as well. But since we know that blindsight is not a form of conscious per ception, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the same must be said of organisms with simple minds?they only have "zombievision" (and, perhaps, likewise for other forms of sensation). The second horn of this dilemma suggests that the FOT theory needs to be fine-tuned. If blindsight subjects really are first-order cognizers, of a sort, then the FOT theory needs to be able to distinguish between varieties of first order thought that are and are not associated with phenomenal aware ness. I will say more about this issue further on. I will also take up the example of the honey bee as a test case for the argument that simple minds are not conscious. To this end, we might turn to techniques widely thought to establish blindsight in monkeys, and ask whether they can be adapted for use in behavioral experi ments with other animals. I suspect that there is nothing it is like to be a bee, and that simple minds are naturally blindsighted. This leads me to propose that the place to draw the line between phenomenal consciousness and blind reactivity lies somewhere near the realm of 7 Peter Carruthers, "Brute Experience," this journal, lxxxvi, 5 (May 1989): 258-69. 8 Ten Problems of Consciousness.</page><page sequence="4">392 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY invertebrates.9 Despite what others have argued, especially Dretske and Tye, there are grounds for thinking that many nonmammals are not phenomenally aware. I. A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE FOT THEORY I begin with a quick sketch of the FOT theory of consciousness. Ac cording to the FOT-theory states of phenomenal awareness depend on the tokening of first-order thoughts or judgments (where second order judgments are thoughts about thoughts). FOT theorists, such as Dretske (op. cit.), Tye,10 and Kirk (op. cit.) are united in maintaining that states of sensory consciousness are "analog" (nonconceptualized) representational states that stand ready to make a direct impact on the contents of first-order thought and judgment. Tye neatly expresses the basic idea: raw sensory contents "supply the inputs for certain cog nitive processes whose job it is to produce beliefs (or desires) directly from the appropriate nonconceptual representations, if attention is properly focused and the appropriate concepts are possessed."11 The FOT explanation of consciousness is motivated in several ways. I have already mentioned the representationalist assumption that all conscious awareness has an intentional character (hence the claim that consciousness is always of-something as-something).12 States of consciousness exhibit classic "marks" of intentionality, including "inten tional inexistence" (you can be conscious of things that do not exist) and "aspectuality" (consciously perceiving someone as Peter Parker does not imply that one is consciously perceiving someone as Spider man, even if Parker is identical to Spiderman). Second, there is the coherence between the structure of phenomenal experience and first order belief.13 There is a sense in which seeing is indeed believing, most obviously for veridical perception, but the same is true even for recollected experiences, hallucinations, and mere imaginings. These last are cases where seeing leads to judgments about what one did believe, mistakenly believes, or would believe under the appropriate circumstances. There is a case for thinking that representational con 91 cannot take up the issue here, but cephalopods (squids and cuttlefish) are a pos sible exception. Perhaps also many vertebrates are restricted to the zombie mode of perception. One concern about my thesis as applied to insects is the disparity between insect and mammalian neuroanatomy. This paper assumes that the implementing mechanisms for consciousness and blindsight are multiply realizable in a deep sense. 10 Ten Problems of Consciousness. 11 Ten Problems of Consciousness, p. 138. 12 For discussion see William Seager, Theories of Consciousness (New York: Routledge, 1999). 13 David Chalmers, The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory (New York: Oxford, 1996).</page><page sequence="5">SIMPLE MINDS 393 tents of conscious perceptions are always mirrored in the attitudes (though, of course, not vice versa).14 FOT is attractive in various other ways, such as its account of non conscious biological representations. While representation in the crude sense of information flow is comparatively ubiquitous (as in the nervous system's homeostatic mechanisms, including those impli cated in the "representations" of internal temperature, oxygen levels, or blood sugar concentration), conscious representations are presum ably rarer. FOT theory accounts for the intuition that only a subset of nervous system representations are conscious?specifically, it is those that "make a cognitive difference." The precise sense in which con scious representations are cognitively efficacious is disputed, but speaking generally, Dretske and Tye maintain that conscious repre sentations "directly" lead to the construction of first-order beliefs.15 FOT theory is also well equipped to explain certain key features of consciousness. The ineffability of consciousness, for example, results from conceptualization, in which the content of analog sensory repre sentations is not wholly preserved (for example, as where one's capac ity to experience color far exceeds one's color vocabulary).16 Another feature explained by FOT (and representationalism generally) is the "diaphanous" character of introspection?this is the idea that intro spected conscious contents never seem to represent "intrinsic" prop erties of experience, but rather properties of what the experience is about: as I introspect my conscious experience of a glass of wine, my self-reflective thought only incorporates content about the wine (argu ably, there are no conscious contents which seem to fail to be part of the wine; more obviously, introspection also fails to reveal properties of the experience as a representational vehicle?this is unusual consider ing that the intrinsic properties of such vehicles are typically observ able, such as shape and color of a book).17 14 Do not examples like the M?ller-Lyer illusion show that there can be conscious perceptual contents that are not mirrored in belief contents? After all, the lines con tinue to look different, even though you believe that they are the same length. I prefer to treat these cases in the manner of "imaginings," that is cases of what you would be lieve, if not for collateral information. Were it not for knowing that they are really the same length, you would believe that they are different. 15 Representationalists disagree over whether nonconceptual sensory representations must actually, or, need only dispositionally, feed into the concept-exercising system. I will assume the latter?though either way leads to the conclusion that insects and perhaps many "lower" vertebrates are not conscious. Certainly, much can be said about what it means for a representation to lead "directly" to the construction of propositional attitudes. 16Tye, Ten Problems of Consciousness, p. 139. 17 Cf. "The moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see what, distinctly, it is, it seems to vanish: it seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness.</page><page sequence="6">394 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Both FOT and its main representationalist rival, the HOT theory18 are versions of "broadcast" or "Global Workspace" models where con scious states are identified as ones widely available for many different kinds of processing, especially those responsible for flexibility in plan ning, action, and verbal report.19 The debate between FOT and HOT theorists is complex, and not resolvable here. However, while many objections to the HOT theory are tailored with specific versions in mind, an important general complaint is that it specifies conditions for consciousness that are implausibly stringent?it seems doubtful that the HOT theory can acknowledge consciousness in animals and infant humans.20 On the other hand, it is generally considered a virtue of the FOT theory that it makes room for the strong possibility of consciousness in nonhumans. However, I will argue that this claim is not plausible when it comes to simple-minded organisms such as in sects, and perhaps also fish, amphibians, and other "lower" vertebrates, whether or not we characterize their cognitive states in terms of beliefs and other attitudes. The reason turns on the cognitive similarity be tween these simple-minded organisms and blindsight subjects: If simple minds are believers, then blindsight subjects probably are as well, but then neither are conscious, and FOT is in need of revision. On the other hand, if blindsight subjects are not believers, then nei ther are the simple minds, but then, once again, neither are phenom enally conscious (and here FOT requires no changes). Either way the FOT theorist should be led to conclude that simple minds are not phenomenally conscious. This is an interesting result, since, of course, the HOT theorist also accepts this. It appears that leading versions of representationalism deliver skepticism about consciousness in many distant relatives of primates and mammals. For the sake of exegetical ease, I will borrow several of Tye's assump tions about the FOT theory as it applies to simple minds, especially his When we try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue; the other element is as if it were diaphanous. Yet it can be distinguished if we look attentively enough, and know that there is something to look for"?George E.

I turn now to examine Tye's an swer to the demarcation problem. In "The Problem of Simple Minds," Tye is interested in what the FOT theory has to say about the emergence of consciousness, phylo genetically speaking. Tye argues that bees (op. cit., p. 172), though not plants, paramecia, or caterpillars (op. cit., p. 173), are phenomenally conscious. His assessment is worth quoting at length: creatures that are incapable of reasoning, of changing their behavior in light of assessments they make, based upon information provided to them by sensory stimulation of one sort or another, are not phenome nally conscious. Tropistic organisms, on this view, feel and experience nothing. They are full-fledged unconscious automata or zombies, rather as blindsight subjects are restricted unconscious automata or partial zombies with respect to a range of visual stimuli (op. cit, p. 172). I agree that there are explanatory rewards to be gained from the com parison of blindsight subjects to natural zombies (or, perhaps, "zomb animals"). Here Tye seems to be assuming that a capacity for learning (at least as contrasted with tropism) is a mark of first-order thought, and thus consciousness. Tye qualifies this claim insofar as learning must be carefully distinguished from mere behavioral sensitivity to ex perience, for otherwise this would not rule out such sources of change as bodily injury. The kind of learning at stake here also goes beyond mere operant conditioning. For there to be consciousness the crea ture must be capable of possessing an "inner representation.. .the con tent of which explains the behavior produced by such changes" (op. cit., p. 184 note 8). This is an important caveat. As I will explain below, blindsight is almost certainly compatible with training and condition ing. It is clearly not just tropism. Indeed, it is probably mediated by inner representations, of at least a rudimentary sort. On the other hand, although there is evidence that insect behavior is mediated by inner representations, of some kind, it is not clear that there is a need to posit the sort of globally integrated representations as de manded by the FOT theory. For example, it is not obvious that it is appropriate to describe simple minds as applying concepts to their sensory representations. In the end, whether or not we call cognition in animals or blindsight subjects "believing" in a strong sense may be of less significance. More telling would be the demonstration that there is a similarity in the kinds of processing that allow learning to take place. In the next section I will explore how this point puts pres sure on the FOT theory. If blindsight is mediated by first-order belief, then there will have to be a better explanation of the connection be tween cognition and consciousness.</page><page sequence="8">396 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Tye contrasts simple believers from nonbelievers by emphasizing that the latter "do not learn from experience," nor "acquire beliefs and change them in light of things that happen to them" (op. cit., p. 173). Stimuli elicit only "automatic responses, with no flexibility" as with caterpillars which "have a very limited range of behaviors avail able...each of which is automatically triggered...by the appropriate stimulus" (op. cit., p. 173). These are on an intellectual par with Daniel Dennett's21 and Douglas Hofstadter's22 "sphexish" wasp. But, he adds, not all insects are rigid automatons: honey bees, for instance. In short, Tye suggests that first-order thought consists in having a cognitive sys tem that produces nonsphexish, flexible, adaptive, responses to novel circumstances. Rudimentary forms of stimulus-response conditioning do not count as belief-apt.23 Tye means to exclude forms of condition ing that do not involve the tokening of behavior-guiding inner repre sentations. Tye also adds that in claiming these humble beings are phenomenally conscious, he is not saying that the bees are aware of their own states of consciousness. For that they would need to "bring their own experiences under concepts"24 using something like a folk theory of mind.25 Tye then turns to examine cognition in the honey bee. Bees learn to use odors in order to recognize conspecifics, they search out new hive sites, they rely on landmarks, perhaps even "cognitive maps," and, of course, they attend to the famous "dance language" in order to lo cate food sources. While many of these abilities are preprogrammed "equally clearly ... the bees learn and use facts about their environ ments as they go along" (ibid., p. 178). Bees learn to employ distinctions between shapes and colors to obtain rewards. Researchers have also 21 Dennett, Elbow Room (Cambridge: MIT, 1984). 22 Hofstadter, "Can Creativity Be Mechanized?" Scientific American, ccxlvii (1982): 18-34. 23 Cf. Dretske's Naturalizing the Mind in which evolved hard-wired "systemic" repre sentations are contrasted with "acquired" representations, that is, those that minimally depend on simple learning processes to form associations between "systemic," that is, innate, representations. 24Tye, "The Problem of Simple Minds," p. 182. 23 For Tye it is a corollary of the fact that a creature cannot introspect that it cannot suffer: "Suffering requires the cognitive awareness of pain. The person who has a bad headache and who is distracted for a moment or two does not suffer at that time. The headache continues to exist...but there is no cognitive awareness of pain and hence no suffering. In the phenomenal sense, however, the pain still exists even though its sub ject is briefly blind to it" (ibid., p. 182). I have difficulty with this. What does it mean to say that there is a headache in the "phenomenal sense" (and not just a nonphenomenal neural vehicle), and yet no subjective viewpoint that is experiencing things in a pain ful way?</page><page sequence="9">SIMPLE MINDS 397 had limited success in getting bees to distinguish letters and even, ap parently, to "anticipate" the movement of feeding trays. Tye argues that: They use the information their senses give them to identify things, to find their way around, to survive.. .Their behavior is sometimes flexible and goal-driven .... Some of the states honey bees undergo are generated by sensory stimulation and make an immediate impact upon their cog nitive systems. This being the case, honey bees...are phenomenally con scious: there is something it is like for them (ibid., p. 180). Dretske26 advocates a similar position, and shares Tye's claim about con scious honey bees. Certainly this may clash (or not) with your intuitive judgment about whether insects are conscious. I find it easier to believe that insects are not conscious. It is a crucial assumption, hardly obvious, that the sort of learning present in bees is strongly suggestive of first order belief, and not some less extravagant process. I happen to think that it would be a virtue of the FOT theory if it does not, after all, attribute consciousness or thought to insects, since this would allow it to evade the charge of "liberalism," but unlike the HOT theory, nevertheless acknowledge consciousness in mammals and birds. I suppose that everyone can at least agree that commonsense attributions of mind get more insecure as we move further away from the paradigm example provided by human beings.27 Confidence in judgments about other minds gradually fades. Fortunately this debate need not end with exchanges of raw intuition. But before I turn to an empirical proposal, allow me to next address a potentially lethal ob stacle to the first-order theory. II. THE BLINDSIGHT OBJECTION Some have challenged the FOT theory on the grounds that it fails to adequately account for blindsight. Blindsight is the disabling condi tion in which damage to the striate (primary visual) cortex results in some peculiar and selective visual deficits. Blindsight patients insist that they cannot see anything within the region of the scotoma, but 26Dretske, "Machines, Plants and Animals: The Origins of Agency," Erkenntnis, lt, 1 (1999): 19-31, "First Person Warrant: Comments on Siewert's The Significance of Con sciousness," Psyche, vn, 11 (2001) &lt;psyche.cs.monash.edu.au&gt;. 27 Harold A. Herzog, Jr., and Shelly Galvin have studied intuitions about the mental lives of nonhumans, and, for better or worse, the relevant folk-intuitions seem to be in line with my own. Although there was evidence of various anthropomorphic tenden cies, only one-third of respondents believed that invertebrates, specifically worms, felt pain?see Herzog and Galvin, "Commonsense and the Mental Lives of Animals: An Empirical Approach," in Robert W. Mitchell, Nicholas S. Thompson, and H. Lyn Miles, eds., Anthropomorphism, Anecdotes, and Animals (Albany: SUNY, 1997), pp. 237-53.</page><page sequence="10">398 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY when prompted by researchers they can issue uncannily accurate "guesses" about the location of flashes, the orientation and shapes of simple figures, the presence of movement, and sometimes even dif ferences in color. Carruthers28 has argued that Hindsight constitutes a straightforward counterexample to the FOT theory, that is, insofar as it appears to be a case of perception feeding into first-order cognitive control.29 Perhaps in anticipation of this objection, some first-order theorists (as above) deny that blindsight involves belief. Others accept that blindsight satisfies the FOT theory, but then claim it is accompa nied by a kind of weak experience after all.30 III. TROUBLES WITH THE FOT THEORY It seems unlikely that blindsight is accompanied by even a weak qual itative aspect. Absent strong grounds to think otherwise, the reports of experimental subjects ought to be taken at face value: it was, after all, patients' verbal reports which led to the discovery of blindsight in the first place. Blindsight also involves cognition?minimally in the sense of nontropistic cognitive control?but perhaps also first-order belief and judgment. (Though keep in mind I am claiming that even if cog nition in blindsight is not belief-apt, FOT probably implies that insects are not conscious anyway.) However, first consider some reasons for thinking that it is more properly cognitive than usually assumed. An under-noticed fact about blindsight is that the performance of subjects tends to improve with practice.31 A gradual improvement in re sidual visual functioning appears to depend on periods of explicit train ing in humans,32 and likewise in monkeys, as discussed by Nicholas Humphrey.33 A second, especially striking, phenomenon in blindsight patients is implicit semantic priming. One example discussed by Petra Stoerig and Alan Cowey (op. cit.) is where verbal judgment about an 28 Carruthers, "Animal Subjectivity," "Consciousness: Higher-order Theories of Con sciousness." 29 Fiona MacPherson makes a similar point in her review of Consciousness, Color and Content in The Philosophical Quarterly, liii (2003): 619-21. Carruthers has since with drawn the objection; see Carruthers, "Who Is Blind to Blindsight?" Psyche, vn, 4 (2001) &lt;psyche.cs.monash.edu.au&gt;. 30 See, for example, Chalmers's The Conscious Mind. 31 Petra Stoerig and Alan Cowey, "Blindsight in Man and Monkey," Brain, cxx (1997): 535-59. 32 Lawrence Weiskrantz and Cowey, "Filling in the Scotoma: A Study of Residual Vi sion after Striate Cortex Lesions in Monkeys," in Eliot Stellar and James M. Sprague, eds., Progress in Physiological Psychology 3 (New York: Academic, 1970), pp. 237-60, see pp. 243-44. 33 Humphrey, "What the Frog's Eye Tells the Monkey's Brain," Brain, Behavior and Evolution, in (1970): 324-37, "Vision in a Monkey without Striate Cortex: A Case Study," Perception, in (1974): 241-55.</page><page sequence="11">SIMPLE MINDS 399 auditorily presented (that is, consciously apprehended) polysemous word (such as 'bank') is influenced by another word, related in mean ing, and, presented within the scotoma (such as, 'river', or, 'money') ? yet patients insist they are unaware of the priming stimulus. It would appear that semantic content can find its way into judgment through nonphenomenal perceptions?this is a surprising and impressive find ing, although, in this regard, blindsight patients do not differ from those with undamaged brains. It is well established that semantic and other stimuli that are unnoticed, or otherwise below the threshold of conscious awareness, can influence the responses of normal subjects in a variety of contexts.34 Evidence of intelligent processing, as in implicit concept recognition (here, word meanings), makes it doubtful that blindsight relies on no more than tropism. Perhaps this is not so aston ishing: there are many forms of unconscious or "implicit" cognizing.35 Another example of unconscious conditioning is offered by William R. Kunst-Wilson and Robert B. Zajonc, who showed that "Individuals can apparently develop preferences for objects in the absence of conscious recognition and with access to information so scanty that they cannot ascertain whether anything at all was shown."36 Another more recent study documents nonconscious effects on emotional responses. John S. Morris and others found that an "angry" face continued to elicit physiological signs of fear in subjects who were not consciously aware of its presence, if they had already been trained to associate it with a negative stimulus (such as a blast of white noise).37 We have gotten used to the idea that conscious thought is just the tip of a very deep iceberg of intelligence. Considered together these sorts of effects might be sug gestive of blindcognition and blindlearning. Perhaps semantic priming should be explained in terms of uncon scious perceptions and first-order beliefs about lexical stimuli. Or per haps these points do not decisively establish that blindsight subjects have beliefs of which they are unaware. Nevertheless adaptive flexibil ity, in the sense of being cognitively sensitive to environmental change is not a sufficient condition for there being something that it is like. Cognitive change can be driven in the absence of phenomenal feel. 34 Several examples are given in Patricia S. Churchland, Brain-wise: Studies in Neurophi losophy (Cambridge: MIT, 2002), pp. 48-50. 35 See Kim Kirsner, Implicit and Explicit Mental Processes (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1998). 36 Kunst-Wilson and Zajonc, "Affective Discrimination of Stimuli That Cannot Be Rec ognized," Science, ccvn (1980): 557-58, see p. 558. 37 Morris, Arne ?hman, and Raymond Dolan, "A Subcortical Pathway to the Right Amygdala Mediating 'Unseen' Fear," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, xcvi, 9 (1999): 1680-85.</page><page sequence="12">400 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Where do these observations about blindlearning leave the FOT theory? It would be a mistake to conclude that the FOT theory has been refuted. The FOT theorist still has options. She could attempt to explain "blindcognition," in terms of more rudimentary learning processes, or, she could tweak the sort of FO-thought required for consciousness. Next, I shall take up versions of these suggestions. Carruthers38 argues that both the HOT and FOT theories can escape criticisms offered by Charles Siewert39 by appealing to a standard neu ropsychological explanation of blindsight known as the "two-systems" theory. This says that vision in the brain is accomplished by two dis tinct "ventral" and "dorsal" pathways.40 These pathways process infor mation in distinctive ways: The ventral stream in the temporal lobe is thought to represent objects and the environment, while the dorsal stream, feeding into the parietal lobe, is concerned with the guidance of action with respect to those objects. The two-systems architecture seems to apply to all primate, and even mammalian, visual systems. The functional distinction is thought to correspond to solving 'What?' versus 'How?' type problems, as in the difference between a monkey recognizing an object as a piece of fruit, versus its being able to reach out and grab it. But for some reason only the phylogenetically newer (ventral) pathway results in conscious visual awareness. The two-sys tems theory is also supported by the discovery of processing dissocia tions between verbal report and blindsight-like prehensile guidance in normal human subjects under experimental conditions.41 These re sults, as with the visuo-motor behavior of patients with striate damage, imply that when only the older, dorsal, stream is online, perception is not phenomenally conscious. Blindsight as a permanent disability is thought to result from destruction of the part of the visual cortex (VI) where the dorsal and ventral streams meet. Although one might ex pect that a striate cortex lesion would disable both streams, visual pro cessing in the parietal lobe also receives massive input via a secondary route known as the "tecto-pulvinar" pathway running through the superior colliculus and pulvinar. In short, it is thought that striate le sions leave dorsal stream functioning largely intact. This brings me to Carruthers's suggestion that the two-systems the ory is compatible with an alternative explanation of the semantic 38 "Who Is Blind to Blindsight?" 39Siewert, "Spontaneous Blindsight and Immediate Availability: A Reply to Carruthers," Psyche, vn, 8 (2001) &lt;psyche.cs.monash.edu.au&gt;. 40 See David Milner and Melvyn Goodale, The Visual Brain in Action (New York: Ox ford, 1995). 41 Goodale, Milner, Lorna S. Jakobson, and David Carey, "A Neurological Dissocia tion between Perceiving Objects and Grasping Them," Nature, cccxlix (1991): 154-56.</page><page sequence="13">SIMPLE MINDS 401 priming effects in terms of tropism and subtle (yet conscious) pro prioceptive cuing.42 Since reflexive tracing of stimuli is preserved, per haps a patient's eyeballs give rise to subtle sensations as they blindly trace the outlines of a (for example, lexical) stimulus. This might help rescue the first-order theory from the criticism that it is incompatible with blindsight, for this would show that semantic content need not play any role in producing the priming effects; in other words, maybe nonsemantic tactile information about the physical form of the stimu lus is serving as a cue. However, I doubt that tactile cuing can account for semantic priming, or other blindsight related phenomena.43 Stimuli presented too briefly to be consciously noticed can exert priming effects in normal subjects, even though they are also too brief for saccadic eye movements to occur. I suppose we might also expect that tactile cues should lead to concrete beliefs, not the insecure guesses characteristic of blindsight (as mentioned by Dennett,44 tactile cues can yield spatial judgments, so why not here as well?). Certainly Carruthers's tactile-cuing hypothesis could be empirically explored. A local anesthetic could be used to inhibit saccades, "tracing" hand move ments could be prevented, etc. However, before we worry too much about this proposal, note that Anthony Marcel's research compensated for cues owing to the mere physical shape of the stimulus by showing 42 Carruthers, "Who Is Blind to Blindsight?" 43 Carruthers is proposing that the reaching, grasping, and discriminatory abilities of blindsight subjects are mediated by subtle tactile feedback from reflexive eye and hand movements. The idea is that, say, a consciously felt "up-and-down" proprioceptive sen sation resulting from a reflexive visual function could be implicitly used to influence a verbal report (say concerning the orientation of a slot). If this is correct, then visual content in blindsight would not necessarily have a direct hand in shaping first-order thought; tactile signals, rather than semantic content, would be directly responsible for producing the cognitive states in blindsight. (Stoerig and Cowey remark that the eye's reflexes are largely unaffected by blindsight: the pupil responds normally to changes in illumination, the eyes track movement, and the blink reflex continues to operate; see op. cit., p. 536.) One reason to doubt Carruthers's speculation is the fact, as noted by Humphrey, that monkeys with blindsight have been known to recover depth perception ("Vision in a Monkey without Striate Cortex"); it seems doubtful that two-dimensional tactile feelings could account for the representation of positions in three-dimensional space. Tactile cuing also seems an unlikely explanation for. the amazing phenomenon of semantic priming, though we might discover in such cases as the two meanings of the word 'bank', that the blindsight subjects tend to move their eyes in specific ways (say in a "zig" fashion when the cue presented in the scotoma is 'river', but a "zag" fashion when it is 'money'). It might be interesting to see if subjects (including persons without blindsight) who have not been primed with lexical cues are more likely to respond in a specific way (say biased toward 'river' when they are asked to move their eyes in the "zig" fashion). 44 Dennett, Consciousness Explained (Boston: Little Brown, 1991), p. 339.</page><page sequence="14">402 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that the effect was case insensitive (for example, 'bird' and 'BIRD').4D Neuroimaging could also be used to confirm that implicit processing of lexical stimuli in blindsight subjects occurs in the fusiform and precen tral gyrus, as with normal subjects who are reading. This speculation is at least consistent with James Danckert and Yves Rossetti's view that there are three styles of blindsight corresponding to three anatomically distinct processing pathways.46 In the next section I will consider the case for thinking that non conscious perceptions in blindsight can enter into implicit first-order judgments or beliefs?though I stress that I am officially agnostic about this. Again, whether or not cognition in blindsight is properly called "believing," there is reason to be skeptical about consciousness in simple minds. I will return to consider the implications of blind sight for insect cognition further on. IV. BLINDSIGHT AND BELIEF? Many who accept the two-systems theory are also inclined to deny that blindsight involves belief. For example, David Milner and Melvyn Goodale47 explain the residual abilities in terms of a contrast between action and belief. In their view the dorsal (blind) system uses momentary representations to guide motor responses (action) whereas the ventral (conscious) system is supposed to "code enduring object features" suit able for long-term storage (belief). Then again, "blindlearning" and "blindcognition" seem to depend on long-term memory storage. Action at the personal level of explanation is typically understood in terms of an interplay of attitudes, especially belief and desire. So per haps this is a reason for ascribing beliefs in blindcognition. However, others would argue that there is no belief, even when restricted as a guide to action, because a person with blindsight will not spontaneously initiate actions: they must instead be prompted by a researcher's en treaties. As Tye would put it, this is because the contents of the guesses are not appropriately "poised" to make a direct impact on the contents of first-order beliefs. These points are not to be taken lightly. But before the matter is deemed closed, consider some second-thoughts. 45 Marcel, "Conscious and Unconscious Perception: Experiments on Visual Masking and Word Recognition," Cognitive Psychology, xv (1983): 197-237. 46 Danckert and Rossetti argue that a sub-variety of blindsight responsible for seman tic priming depends on areas MT and V4 in the temporal cortex which also receive input from the tecto-pulvinar pathway. James Danckert and Yves Rossetti, "Blindsight in Action: Wfiat Can the Different Sub-types of Blindsight Tell Us about the Control of Visually Guided Actions?" Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Review, xxix, 7 (2005): 1035-46. 47 The Visual Brain in Action.</page><page sequence="15">SIMPLE MINDS 403 First, the issue of spontaneity. Blindsight in monkeys, at least, re quires no entreaties (obviously the matter of verbal instruction is not straightforward!). It is far from clear that monkeys with blindsight should be characterized as guessing.48 To make sense of this issue we should ask what it means for a behavior to be spontaneous, as opposed to guesswork. The need for guessing in human blindsight patients re flects their ignorance about the required style of response (for exam ple, Should I verbalize? But in what way? Or point? Where? Grasp? How?). In this context, guessing is a response that is structured by "forced choice" conditions, that is, conditions where the subject is pro vided with information that greatly narrows the range of behavioral re sponse (for example, for a human, knowing that one must choose between two words, or, for a monkey, being restricted to either touch ing or not touching a screen). If this information is not provided, then the subject will not respond at all to stimuli in the scotoma. But "guess ing" so defined is compatible with the tokening of first-order belief. Perhaps knowledge of the narrow range of correct responses is a con dition for tokening the belief that p. Certainly, a naturally dissociated organism would need to be "tuned" to its environment and naturally occurring "forced choice" conditions, for example, as with a frog that is disposed to always strike in a stereotyped way towards any small tar get moving across the horizontal axis of its visual field. In simpler or ganisms, information about whether to (say) strike or flee in response to a visual target could be made available in the normal course of de velopment. This could take the form of information imparted by trial and error, or the required narrowness in the response-range could just be built into the cognitive system. Perhaps it is a peculiarity of human self-consciousness that higher order judgment suppresses the spontaneous exercise of blindsight. Conflicts between "executive" and implicit cognitive processes are not uncommon, and this would not be an issue for the simple minds. It is known that blindsight can interfere with conscious visual process ing?visual targets in the blind field can delay a response to targets in the conscious field. Perhaps primate brains are designed to maintain the dominance of ventral stream processing. Or perhaps further re search will show that human patients can be retrained to further ex ploit their residual abilities without prompting, and with greater confidence. In human patients, rehabilitation has, quite understand ably, focused on widening the conscious field rather than attempting 48 As noted by Stoerig and Cowey, op. cit, p. 533.</page><page sequence="16">404 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to develop an intuitive trust in the blind field, as noted by Stoerig and Cowey (ibid.).49 Patients themselves characterize their blindcognizing as guessing, but might this be a consequence of their being unaware of one or more of their beliefs? Many accept there can be mental states an agent is oblivious to. One such case for Tye is when a sensory representation fails to fall under what he calls a phenomenal concept (as in driving distractedly, or animals wholly without phenomenal concepts?such as bees). Certainly the idea that subjects have incorrigible access to their own attitudes has been out of vogue, at least since Freud. Might blindsight subjects, whether human or animal, have beliefs that they act on, but are unaware of, and incapable of using in higher-order representation? The fact that they do not have beliefs about their guesses is compatible with saying these "guesses" are actually inaccu rate meta-judgments about implicit lower-order beliefs. Another way of approaching the question of whether there is belief in blindsight is by asking what would count as a belief in a simple mind. Consider next how Tye characterizes a simple case of percep tually mediated cognition (as in a fish): first, he says that a perceptual concept is: a stored memory representation that has been acquired through the use of sense organs and is available for retrieval, thereby enabling a range of discriminations .... Perceptual beliefs are (roughly) representational states that bring to bear such concepts upon stimuli and that interact in rational ways, however simple, with one another...in response to [the creature's] needs. Perceptual beliefs are like inner maps by which the creature steers. They function as guides to behavior .. ..50 Tye also says that since fish use vision to learn by trial and error, make associations, solve problems, and achieve their rudimentary goals, we should say that they have beliefs, and, by FOT, tentatively conclude they are conscious (ibid., pp. 175-76). For now I will accept as a work ing definition Tye's view that beliefs are map-like representations that mediate rudimentary forms of practical reason. Many cognitive ethologists hold that a minimal constraint on the ascription of these map-like representational states is that they explain how an organism responded adaptively and flexibly to novel stimuli; for example, at least sometimes, the best explanation as to why an animal took a 49 Care is in order here given that blindsight patients are deeply disabled. Nobody should suppose that the "super" blindsight imagined by Block, in "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness," is a serious possibility. 50 "The Problem of Simple Minds," p. 176.</page><page sequence="17">SIMPLE MINDS 405 shortcut to achieve a goal, will not appeal, as a behaviorist might, to its conditioning history. But we can explain it by assuming the manipula tion of a cognitive map, an inner representation of its spatial environ ment.51 Skinnerian learning is not robustly cognitive in this sense, since it does not posit map-like representations to explain flexible, adaptable, and goal-driven behavior. In fact, I suspect that learning mediated by blindsight occurs only in the Skinnerian mode, and that most or all insects are Skinnerian creatures. On the other hand, while there are some grounds for thinking that map-like representations can be ascribed to navigating insects, the same has been claimed for some animals with blindsight. This is part of the basis for claiming a cognitive similarity between (very) simple minds and blindsight. Consider the case of a blindsighted monkey, Helen, studied by Humphrey.52 Helen's behavior seemed to fit the pattern of intentional explanation, she learned by trial and error, she could make simple discriminations, and her blindsight might have included the manipu lation of cognitive maps. Moreover, these abilities were spontaneously expressed and depended only on "prompting" from the environment, not researchers. Stoerig and Cowey report that Helen was able to orient towards, follow, grasp, detect, localize, and discrimi nate visual objects. Apart from her excellent abilities in formal tests she could move about freely, would not bump into objects and obsta cles... and often appeared normal in her spontaneous visually guided be havior as long as she was not alarmed (op. cit., p. 549). I see little reason to characterize Helen's cognizing as guessing rather than believing. So, the case against the presence of belief (in Tye's sense) in animals with blindsight is not so clear-cut after all. I want to say more about this issue, but first allow me to consider the impli cations for the representational theory of consciousness if there is belief in blindsight. It has been suggested that the first-order theory is in danger of ref utation if blindsight is implicated in first-order judgment. Actually, this is not the case. My claim is that if blindsight does, after all employ belief, then FOT is only in need of amendment. (Though, as I say, the antecedent of this conditional may well be false.) The case of Helen notwithstanding, blindcognition generally seems to lack the integration associated with phenomenal awareness; it does not inter 51 See Charles R. Gallistel, "Insect Navigation: Brains as Symbol-processing Organs," in Don Scarborough and Saul Sternberg, eds., An Invitation to Cognitive Science, Volume 4 (Cambridge: MIT, 1998, 2nd ed.), pp. 1-51. 52 "Vision in a Monkey without Striate Cortex."</page><page sequence="18">406 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY face with other sensory modes, or help supply a global model of the environment usable in even basic forms of practical reason. However, even if there is belief in blindsight, FOT can be rescued by appealing to its differing style of information processing as compared with con scious sight. On this alternative version of the FOT theory (for clarity call this FOT*), phenomenally conscious states are those sensory rep resentations poised to construct first-order thoughts characteristic in dorsal-style ^processing: specifically, poised, abstract, nonconceptual representations that make a direct impact on the use of recognitional concepts in first-order cognition. Why should this make a difference as to whether a representation is conscious? Consider patients with optic ataxia, who are consciously aware of objects, their properties, and spatial relations. Their verbal judgments seem belief-apt, and can be issued spontaneously. However these patients cannot reach and grasp those same objects. Researchers believe that their visuo motor deficits are due to damage in the dorsal stream of the parietal lobe?exactly what is to be expected given the two-systems theory.53 Perhaps in blindsight the brain continues to represent perceptual ele ments (for example, edge, orientation, location, luminance, move ment), but the integration of these elements in ventral stream processing has failed. So low-level perceptual features are not used to construct representations of discrete objects, and their spatial rela tions. FOT* would therefore be compatible with the view that blind sight involves a truncated form of first-order belief where the belief contents are about these disorganized elements of the visual environ ment. Perhaps that is the sort of cognizing that best explains Helen's behavior. But then the claim that there is not mere information pro cessing, but genuine belief in blindsight is not such a devastating point after all. I advance the notion of FOT* tentatively, partly out of conservatism: clearly there are processing differences between conscious and non conscious seeing awaiting a more precise characterization by neuro science. The question of FOT* turns on unresolved empirical matters. The discovery of cognitive maps in animals depends on testing to see if performance in navigation-related (and other) tasks is improved by allowing the subject to familiarize itself with an environment (for ex ample, the layout of a maze), and then seeing if it is capable of depart ing from established patterns in new situations (again, as in taking a short-cut when confronted with a blocked path). Images of mazes 53 Goodale, "Why Vision Is More Than Seeing," Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supple mentary Volume 27, Naturalism, Evolution, and Intentionality (Calgary: University Press, 2001), pp. 187-214.</page><page sequence="19">SIMPLE MINDS 407 could be presented in the scotoma of blindsight subjects in order to see what affect, if any, this has on navigation tasks. If map4ike repre sentations are implicitly processed, then that would be a reason to ascribe implicit beliefs after all. This may have been what was going on with Helen, but without further investigation into the implicit pro cessing of map-like stimuli, the question of whether a change to FOT* is called for must be tabled. This is not to deny the serious considerations suggesting that blind sight is not sufficiently belief-apt. Blindsight, at least in humans, is so disabling because it does not facilitate the exercise of practical reason: A thirsty subject will not reach for a glass of water viewable only from the blind field.54 The informational states in blindsight are not widely available, or "informationally promiscuous," especially for the pur poses of planning and inference. I do accept that this is a compelling reason to doubt that cognizing mediated by blindsight is belief. What ever else a belief is, it is not an unreasonable demand that its ascrip tion to a subject depends on its tendency to facilitate the satisfaction of the subject's desires. Of course, the sense of belief that I am borrowing from Tye, that the subject exhibits discriminatory capacities mediated by "map-like" (highly integrated) representational states, might be inadequate. The question of belief and concept possession in nonhumans is very con troversial. Maybe concept possession is restricted to speakers of a lan guage. Some argue that a generalized ability to make distinctions is strongly suggestive of concept-possession. Two favorite examples are pigeons, which can discriminate Impressionist from Cubist paintings, amazingly, even for paintings never encountered,55 and the African Grey Parrot, Alex, who could make correct verbal reports about shape, color, and quantity for seemingly arbitrary and novel combinations of objects and properties.56 Or perhaps these abilities are better explained 54 Block observes that this example is awkward since blindsight patients cannot dis criminate glasses of water anyway, even via nonphenomenal guessing, in "On a Confu sion about a Function of Consciousness." But the point is just that they cannot satisfy their desires by following cues that appear within the scotoma. On the other hand, one would think that a thirsty person could learn to associate reliable guesses about flashes of light with the presence of a glass of water, that is, on the assumption that the envi ronment is stable and flashes correlate with glasses of water. 55Shigeru Watanabe,Junko Sakamoto, and Masumi Wakita, "Pigeons' Discrimination of Paintings by Monet and Picasso," Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, lxiii (1995): 165-74. 56 Irene Pepperberg, "A Communicative Approach to Animal Cognition: A Study of the Conceptual Abilities of an African Grey Parrot," in Carolyn Ristau, ed., Cognitive Ethology: The Minds of Other Animals: Essays in Honor of Donald R Oriffin (Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1991), pp. 153-86.</page><page sequence="20">408 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by appealing to the birds' nonconceptual discrimination of perceptual features in the stimuli sets. In any case, there is little reason to think that insects (or Hindsight patients) can perform tasks such as these. Or does blindcognition satisfy a weaker notion of belief, in which case FOT* would need to specify the stronger sense needed for phe nomenal consciousness? In fact, I suspect that learning mediated by Hindsight occurs only in the Skinnerian mode of associative learning, which does not cry out for explanation in terms of map-like representa tions, but that, likewise, simple minds are Skinnerian creatures. In saying this, however, it should be clear that I can remain neutral on the issue of whether animals really have beliefs and concepts: my ar gument turns on the analogy between the global processing styles of Hindsight and cognition in simple minds, and not on whether we decide to call this "belief" or "conceptualization."57 The labels mat ter less than the clarification of the precise difference between the cognitive-behavioral profiles of blindsight and conscious sight. Blind sight has a distinct signature that can be used to help determine whether or not a nonhuman is perceiving consciously. V. BLINDSIGHT IN MONKEYS Stoerig and Cowey (op. cit.) discuss experimental paradigms that might be helpful for the study of nonconscious perception in various other animals.58 Stoerig and Cowey tested de-striated animal subjects for residual nonconscious visual functions in nonverbal localization and classification tasks of visual targets. Their experimental procedure comprised two stages. The preliminary task is a measure of residual vision. The other is supposed to indicate the presence or absence of conscious awareness. The experimental subject is a half-ablated (hemianopic) monkey, that is, with hemispheric damage consistent with blindsight on one side of the visual field in a human. The subject elects to begin a trial by pushing a button in the center of a video dis play, causing a target to be briefly flashed in one hemifield. Responses 57 It is tempting to think of the cognitive distinction between dorsal stream process ing and ventral stream visuomotor control in light of the familiar difference between "knowing-how" versus "knowing-that." The trainability of blindsight is compatible with what psychologists call "procedural knowledge," as in kinesthetic skills such as knowing how to ride a bike, post a letter, track a moving target, and so on. This is usually con trasted with "declarative" knowledge of things and concepts, especially as expressed verbally. But on second thought, the phenomenon of semantic priming does not seem to fit this picture, and the know how/know that distinction generally seems to cut across the distinction between conscious and nonconscious mentation. 58 Weiskrantz proposes something like this in his review of the blindsight literature? see Consciousness Lost and Found: A Neuropsychological Exploration (New York: Oxford, 1997), chapter 4.</page><page sequence="21">SIMPLE MINDS 409 consist in localizing the stimulus, an illuminated spot on the touch sensitive screen. Note that in this first stage, initiating a trial always leads to the appearance of a target, either in the normal field, or else on the side suspected to be afflicted with blindsight. The brain-damaged mon keys are highly successful at locating targets, regardless of where they appear on the display. In the second task, the hemianopic monkey is again required to lo calize visual targets by touching them. Occasionally, however, no visual target is presented after the monkey initiates a trial. In this case, the monkey is required to classify the visual scene as having no stimulus present, or as a "blank field," by touching an omnipresent white square on the left side of the display (lying within the normal visual field). As expected, normal monkeys give the "blank field" response when ap propriate. However, the hemianopic monkeys behave differently: they give the "blank field" response for stimuli presented on the damaged side. So, Stoerig and Cowey claim that hemianopic monkeys success fully locate stimuli that they also classify as "no stimulus present." This would seem to suggest that they are responding nonconsciously using their residual visuomotor (dorsal stream) responsiveness: "we inter pret their indicating 'blank trial' in the hemianopic field as evidence for phenomenal blindness, another incidence of species similarity" (op. CiL, p. 552). Next I will consider how a similar procedure could be used with other kinds of organisms?we may even find it reveals that some are "naturally dissociated." VI. NATURAL ZOMBIES First, consider whether the idea of a naturally dissociated organism is biologically realistic. Nonphenomenal awareness would certainly suffice for survival in some contexts. Limited sensory capabilities are better than none at all, and under the right conditions they could fa cilitate catching prey, avoiding predators, some navigational abilities, and acquiring mates. Would we be inclined to say that such behavior is best explained in terms of stereotyped tropes? Not necessarily. Such an animal would seem cognitively "normal" in the respects that seem to count as having a simple mind (at least for Tye): it learns from ex perience, utilizes perception to guide its goal-directed behaviors, per haps even employs cognitive maps, and so on. In short, the creature need not substantially differ from many other animals, insofar as it acts as if it has simple beliefs and desires. It would have to be designed so that environmental cuing sufficed to activate its visuomotor "action oriented" processing. The representation of "elemental" or fragmen tary stimuli might be enough for a simple mind to get by. Phenom enally blind visuomotor processing could also be supplemented by</page><page sequence="22">410 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tropistic motor-programs, again tuned to release behavior given the appropriate stimulus in environments with an amount of stability worth exploiting (perhaps as in the ritualized prey capture sequences in snakes, web building in spiders, predatory strikes by frogs, or per haps even waggle dancing in honey bees). Drawing these points together, we are left with the idea that some creatures possess a rudi mentary action-oriented psychology, though like blindsight subjects, they are not subjectively conscious. This brings the discussion close to an empirically adequate solution to the problem of simple minds. VII. IS THERE NOTHING IT IS LIKE TO BE A BEE? Consider a concrete example: the honey bee. Does bee vision fit within the behavioral profile of visuomotor processing characteristic of the dorsal stream? It is well known that animal learning is often con strained in surprising and seemingly arbitrary ways. Perhaps we will dis cover that something like blindlearning is one such restriction as regards bees. Cognition in bees is impressive, but not so different from what is evident in blindsight. Bees associate colors with food sources by flying directly to the site with the appropriate color. Experiments have shown a learning bias for complex "busy" shapes, and here too re sponses are indicated by directly landing on feeding trays.59 Tye men tions that honey bee learning is subject to some "striking limitations" such as the fact that they cannot learn a flower's odor except when they are sitting on it.60 This is not surprising if bees do not categorize their visual environment in terms of discrete objects; instead it sounds possible that they are advancing or retreating in response to frag mentary stimuli point-sources. Even stinging tends to be arbitrarily directed towards sources of rapid movement: apparently bees do not keep track of which individual provoked them.61 But instead of jumping to conclusions about whether they satisfy the FOT theory's demand for belief-apt processing, consider how the revised version of Stoerig and Cowey's paradigm might be applied to them. How would they perform in a version of the experimental paradigm that Storeig and Cowey argued reveals blindsight in primates? Are bees more like monkeys with, or without, blindsight? If it can be assumed that Cowey and Stoerig's procedure really does show that destriated monkeys really do have blindsight, then when 59 See James L. Gould and Carol Grant Gould, The Honey Bee (New York: Scientific American Library), p. 165. ^Tye, "The Problem of Simple Minds," p. 184, n. 9. 61 As mentioned by Gould and Gould, op. cit., p. 52.</page><page sequence="23">SIMPLE MINDS 411 they choose the white square, the monkeys are indicating an inability to perform the categorization task. This is a key difference between normal monkeys and blindsight subjects?the latter have great difficulty categor izing stimulus situations. Perhaps this is because they lack the integrated representations that make multi-sensory "global" processing possible. In the case of the bees, things might work like this. Simulated flowers could serve as landing zones. These mock flowers could be contrived in such a way that the presence of sugar-water (the unconditioned stimulus) can be rapidly introduced or removed. The landing pads should also be equipped to shine brightly when necessary. The object here, as in experiments using standard Yshape mazes to investigate learning in bees, is to test their ability to associate an illuminated land ing zone with the reward. As with the monkeys, the point is to see how honey bees handle various localization, discrimination, and cate gorization tasks. For instance, a bee could be tested for localization abilities by requiring it to learn to land on the appropriate pad in re sponse to its being briefly illuminated?from what we already know, bees should have no problem here. The interesting question is whether they can perform the categoriza tion task?for this there would have to be two additional colored land ing pads in a "response-area," (say, blue for "signal present," and yellow for "blank field"), and these would be physically displaced from the stimulus site. Successful completion would consist in learning to land on the pad with the appropriate color. This sounds easy enough, and certainly many animals, certainly most birds and mammals, are adept at various categorization tasks. As for bees, they have great difficulty with complex patterns: although "[t]hey learn to recognize patterns on the basis of their position in the visual field, spatial orientation, geometry, size, spatial frequency, depth, motion contrast and bilateral symmetry," the categorization of patterns is highly restricted to such features as orientation and bilateral symmetry.62 It is not obvious that a bee is capable of learning the categorization task, and if it cannot, then this is something it holds in common with the blindsighted monkey; failing it is predicted for blindsighted, but not conscious, sub jects. However, a natural blindsighter ought to succeed at localization and (some) discrimination tasks. My explanation of this is that it does not possess a robust representation of the visual field (in the sense of one which allows it to discriminate between stimulus-present and 62 See Martin Giurfa, "The Amazing Mini-Brain: Lessons from a Honey Bee," Bee World, lxxxiv, 1 (2003): 5-18, see p. 8.</page><page sequence="24">412 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY stimulus-not present type situations, especially for novel stimuli) ,63 In saying this one need not take a stand on the question of belief in ani mals: the question of whether there is a nonverbal criterion for con sciousness logically differs from the question as to whether the FOT theory offers the best explanation of consciousness. One nagging concern about this proposal concerns anatomy. Al though the organization of the honey bee's nervous system is not very well understood, there does not seem to be anything analogous to the primate visual cortex. Accordingly, it is not expected that there are structures comparable to the dorsal and ventral systems in mammals. So, it is probably not possible to reinforce findings about visually medi ated behavior with deep comparisons of visual functioning. Indeed, even if bees are conscious, it cannot be assumed that a discrimination/ categorization dissociation could be induced by surgical intervention, since the neural implementation of vision might be drastically different. However, we can still ask how we would hypothetically interpret the re sponses of two organisms, one whose behavior fell under the pattern exhibited by the monkey using its conscious field, and another who fell under the pattern of the monkey relying only on blindsight. An organism capable of performing the full variety of visually mediated tasks is more likely seeing consciously. Allow me to close by addressing some aspects of honey bee behav ior that, at least at first, seem to not fit with the hypothesis that they have zombievision. Bees exploit spatial context, using features such as landmarks to navigate. Some have proposed that bees employ cogni tive maps in navigation,64 though this interpretation is not universally accepted.65 Perhaps instead of cognitive maps, simpler representa tional mechanisms suffice to explain insect navigational behavior.66 Their sensitivity to landmarks might seem to stand in contrast with the reduced abilities in blindsight. Bees can also be trained to land on the geometric center in a pattern of surface features. This too suggests that bees can make use of visual information in more ways than merely approaching or retreating from a stimulus point source. Yet these re sults are not necessarily hostile to the proposal here. Even in blindsight 63 Again, novelty is necessary to offset possible "killjoy" explanations appealing to mere conditioned response. 64 For some discussion, see Gould and Gould, op. ext. 65 Wolfgang H. Kirchner and U. Braun offer skepticism in "Dancing Honey Bees Indicate the Location of Food Sources Using Path Integration Rather than Cognitive Maps," Animal Behavior, xlviii (1994): 1437-41. 66 See R?diger Wehner and Randolf Menzel, "Do Insects Have Cognitive Maps?" An nual Review of Neuroscience, xin (1993): 403-14; R?diger Wehner, "Middle-Scale Naviga tion: The Insect Case," The Journal of Experimental Biology, cxcix (1996): 125-27.</page><page sequence="25">SIMPLE MINDS 413 the target stimulus can be complex, rather than a mere point source, if spatial-perceptual elements, such as edges, orientation, movement, luminosity, and location, are available to be exploited. The bees' use of landmarks can also be compared to the blind sighted monkey Helen who, recall, gradually learned to navigate and avoid obstacles.67 Despite her inability to recognize familiar ob jects, she would pick a currant up from the floor, but squash a cock roach (ibid., p. 245). Even the reported ability of bees to "anticipate" the movement of feeding sites is echoed in the blindsighted monkey's abilities. Sometimes, when reaching for a scurrying cockroach, Helen would direct her grab appropriately in apparent anticipation of the insect's future path. Perhaps the bees' "anticipation" of a change in a feeding site's position is a kind of slow motion version of grasping actions that incorporate target deflection. Perhaps Helen's blindsight utilized map-like representations, as do the bees. Or perhaps maps are not necessary for either. It is sobering to consider that at least one type of learning in the honey bee?olfactory?is mediated by a single (token!) neuron. Is the processing in this neuron sufficiently map-like to count as an inner-representation guiding flexibly adaptive behav ior? All that can be said for sure is that blindsight is far more complex than this.68 VIII. CONJECTURAL CONCLUSION: A SCIENCE OF NATURAL ZOMBIES? FOT theorists are mistaken to assume that HOT theory is the only representationalist account of consciousness that delivers a skeptical assessment of simple minds. The leading versions of representational ism claim that consciousness depends on a kind of "attitude apt" in formation processing. The monkey experiments suggest an empirical test for nonconscious awareness in primates. Fitting these together yields both a general method for detecting consciousness in non humans, and an explanation: Animals are conscious if they can ma nipulate internal map-like representations of a perceptual field so as to pursue their goals, as in whether they can not only locate visual targets, but also categorize the situation as "stimulus present." The pre diction is that simple-minded zombanimals will succeed at localization tasks, but fail categorization tasks. This is an intuitively satisfying result: unlike the HOT theory, FOT theory still has the resources to acknowledge consciousness in many birds, mammals, and other or 67 See Humphrey, "Vision in a Monkey without Striate Cortex," pp. 244ff. 68 Giurfa mentions that electrochemical manipulation of this neuron?known as "VUMmxl"?will induce associations between an olfactory stimulus and a "virtual" reward?a genuine, though primitive, case of manufactured learning (op. cit, p. 13).</page><page sequence="26">414 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ganisms with map4ike representations. This skepticism extends only to the simple minds, about whom common sense is at best uncertain. Of course, maybe the honey bee is not the right (or only) candidate that ought to be examined.69 It may be that blindsight subjects do not have robustly map4ike representations, while navigating insects do. Still, even this is compatible with saying that insects which do not nav igate are zombanimals. But perhaps bees accomplish all they do using only sensorimotor responses akin to the visuomotor processing characteristic of blind sight. This was a two-pronged argument: blindsight seems to be more sophisticated than what is to be expected from tropism and simple conditioning. Meanwhile, cognition in insects is not so obviously best characterized in terms that would distinguish it from blindsight. In sects, and perhaps many "lower" vertebrates might not need to con struct representations of objects and their global spatial relations. For the natural zombie hypothesis to be fleshed out, it will be nec essary to show that the localization/signal-detection paradigm can be adapted to other sense modalities, such as audition, olfaction and so on?and this (worryingly) might require something like a what/how processing distinction, and corresponding anatomical divisions. Then again, phenomena reminiscent of blindsight have been discovered in other sensory modalities, including a tactile analogue known as "blindtouch" or "numbsense," "blindsmell," "deafhearing," and even an emotional variant known as "alexithymia."70 If consciousness is a 69 Other blindsight-like cases may include "extra-optic" perception, such as the "pa rietal eye" in some reptiles (actually a light sensitive pineal gland), and the light sen sitive cutaneous photo-receptors in the tail of the sea snake (for some discussion of extra-optic perception, see N.B. Ford and Gordon M. Burghardt, "Perceptual Mecha nisms and the Behavioral Ecology in Snakes," in R.A. Seigel and J.T. Collins, eds., Snakes: Ecology and Behavior (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1993), pp. 117-64, see p. 120). 70 See Jacques Paillard, Francois Michel, and George Stelmach, "Localization without Content: A Tactile Analogue of 'Blindsight'," Archives of Neurology, xl (1983): 548-51, and Rossetti, Gilles Rode, and Dominique Boisson, "Numbsense: A Case Study and Im plications," in Beatrice Gelder, Edward Haan, and Charles Heywood, eds., Out of Mind: Varieties of Unconscious Processes (New York: Oxford, 2001), pp. 265-92.

These grounds for thinking that there are "blind" cognates for other (perhaps all) modalities should not be mistaken for evidence that the neurophysiological implemen</page><page sequence="27">SIMPLE MINDS 415 high4evel natural kind, then perhaps there is a behavioral profile common to all varieties of conscious sensing. There is hope for mak ing further progress on the problem of simple minds. Finally, versions of the Stoerig-Cowey paradigm could be adapted for use with other animals, especially nonprimate mammals, in which the issue of divergent neural architecture is less of a concern. For ex ample, destriated bats would probably also exhibit signal-detection/ localization dissociations. It is well known that many bats can be trained to make visual discriminations, and since they are mammals, the dorsal-ventral processing distinction presumably applies to them, and so a visual cortex lesion in a bat would probably result in blind sight-like residual seeing. Such an investigation could help answer skeptics, such as Kathleen Akins, who have argued on neuroanatomi cal grounds that there is nothing it is like to be a bat.71 SEAN ALLEN-HERMANSON Florida International University tation of nonconscious perception will neatly mesh with the details about blindsight, such as the ventral/dorsal stream distinction. On the other hand, Lane et al. ("Alexithymia: A New Neurological Model," p. 135) mention that the "common denominator" for at least two of these conditions (numbsense and blindsmell) is damage in the primary sen sory cortex specific to that sensory function. Josef Raushecker even offers a "two-system" explanation of human audition that distinguishes between a conscious/ventral path and a blind/dorsal path?Rauschecker, "Cortical Processing of Complex Sounds," Current Opinion in Neurobiologe viii (1998): 516-21.
