<plain_text><page sequence="1">V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i</page><page sequence="2">ITALO CALVINO The Road to San Giovanni general explanation of the world and of history must A \ first of all take into account the way our house was situ ated, in an area once known as "French Point," on the last slopes at the foot of San Pietro hill, as though at the border between two continents. Below, just beyond our gate and the private drive, lay the town with its pavements shop win dows cinema-posters newspaper-kiosks, the Piazza Colombo a few moments' walk away, then the seafront; above, you only had to go out the kitchen door to the beudo that ran behind the house (you know what a beudo is: a ditch with a wall above and a narrow paving of flagstones beside running horizontally across the hill to take water from the streams to the fields) and immediately you were in the country, striding up cobbled mule tracks, between dry stone walls and vineyard supports and greenery. That was the way my father always left the house, in his huntsman's clothes, with his leggings, and you could hear the sound of his hobnail boots on the flagstones by the ditch, and the brass tinkling of his dog's collar, and the squeak of the little gate that opened into the road that led to San Pietro. The way my father saw things, it was from here up that the world began, while the other part of the world below the house was a mere appendix, necessary sometimes when there were things to be done, but alien and insignificant, to be crossed in great strides, as though in flight, without looking right or left. But 1 1</page><page sequence="3">ITALO CAL VINO I didn't agree, in fact quite the opposite: as I saw it, the world, the map of the planet, began on the other side of our house and went downward, everything else being a blank space with no marks and no meaning; it was down in the town that the signs of the future were to be read, from those streets and those nighttime lights that were notjust the streets and lights of our small secluded town, but the town, a glimpse of all possible towns, as its harbor was likewise all the harbors of all the continents, and as I leaned out from the balustrades around our garden, everything that attracted and be wildered me was within reach, yet immensely far away, everything was implicit, like the nut in its husk, the future and the present, and the harbor-still leaning out over those balustrades, and I'm not really sure if I'm talking about an age when I never left the garden or of an age when I would always be running off, out and about, because now the two ages have fused together, and this age is one and the same thing as those places, which are no longer places or anything else-the harbor, I was saying, you couldn't see, it was hidden behind the rooftops of the tall houses in Piazza Sardi and Piazza Bresca, only the strip of the wharf rising above them and the tips of the boats' masts; and the streets were hidden too and I could never get their layout to match that of the roofs, so un recognizable did proportions and perspectives seem to me from up above: there the bell tower of San Siro, the pyramidal cupola of the Prince Amadeus Municipal Theatre, here the iron tower of the old Gazzano elevator factory (now that these things have gone forever, their names impose themselves on the page, irreplaceable and peremptory, demanding salvation), the mansards of the so called Parisian Building, a block of rented flats owned by cousins of ours, which at that time (I'm talking about the late twenties now) was an isolated outpost of distant metropolises stranded on the rocky San Francesco River valley ... Beyond all this, like a cur tain, the Porta Candelieri side of the river-the water itself was hidden down at the bottom with its reeds, its washerwomen, its scum of refuse under the Roglio bridge-rose in a steep hill where my family then owned a precipitously sloping allotment, and where the old Pigna casbah clung on, gray and porous as a disinterred bone, with bits that were tarry black or yellow and tufts of grass, and above, on the site of the old San Costanzo quarter, destroyed by the earthquake of '87, was a public garden, neatly kept and a 12</page><page sequence="4">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI little sad, whose hedges and espaliers climbed up the hill: as far as the dance floor of a workingmen's club mounted on scaffolding, the shabby building of the old hospital, the eighteenth-century sanctuary of the Madonna della Costa, with its imposing mass of blue. Mothers' shouts, the songs of girls or of drunkards, depend ing on the time of day, the day of the week, would shear off from these superurban slopes to tumble down onto our garden, clear through a sky of silence; while shut in among the red scales of its roofs the city sounded its confused clatter of trams and hammers, and the lone trumpet in the courtyard of the De Sonnaz barracks, and the hum of the Bestagno sawmill, and-at Christmastime-the music of merry-go-rounds along the seafront. Every sound, every shape, led one back to others, more sensed than heard or seen, and so on and on. My father's road likewise led far away. The only things he saw in the world were plants and whatever had to do with plants, and he would say all their names out loud, in the absurd Latin botanists use, and where they came from-all his life he'd had a passion for studying and acclimatizing exotic plants-and their popular names, too, if they had them, in Spanish or in English or in our local dialect, and into this naming of plants he would put all his passion for exploring a universe without end, for venturing time and again to the farthest frontiers of a vegetable genealogy, open ing up from every branch or leaf or venation as it were a water way for himself, within the sap, within the network that covers the green earth. And in growing his plants-because that was an other of his passions, or rather his main passion-in farming our San Giovanni estate (he would go there every morning, leaving by the beudo door with his dog, half an hour's walk even at his pace, almost all of it uphill) he would be forever anxious, but as though it wasn't so much his getting a good yield out of those few hectares that he really cared about, as his doing whatever he could to fur ther a task of nature that required human assistance, to grow every thing that could be grown, to offer oneself as a link in a story that goes on and on, from the seed, the cutting for planting out or for grafting to the flower to the fruit to the plant and then over and over again without beginning or end in the narrow confines of the earth (the plot or the planet). But just a rustle of grass from beyond the strips of land he worked, a flutter, a squeak, and he 13</page><page sequence="5">ITALO CAL VINO would jump up, eyes round and staring, small beard pointed, to stand there, ears straining (he had a motionless face, like an owl's, with sudden starts sometimes, like a bird of prey, eagle or condor), and he wasn't the farmer anymore but the woodsman, the hunter, because this was his passion-his first, yes, his first, or rather his last, the final shape of his one passion, to know to grow to hunt, in every way to get on top of things, inside them, in that wild wood, in the non-anthropomorphic universe, before which (and only there) a man was a man-to hunt, to lie in ambush, in the cold night before dawn, on the bleak heights of the Colla Bella or the Colla Ardente, waiting for the thrush, the hare (a pelt hunter, like all Ligurian farmers; his dog was a bloodhound), or to go right into the wood, to beat it inch by inch, dog's nose in the ground, for all the animal trails, in every gorge where over the last fifty years foxes and badgers had dug their lairs and only he knew where, or when he went without his gun-to the sort of place where thrusting mushrooms swell the sodden earth after rain or edible snails streak it, the familiar wood with its toponymy that went back to the time of Napoleon-Monsui Marco, the Corporal's Sash, Artillery Way and every game bird and every scent was reason enough to walk for miles off the paths, beating the mountainside gully after gully for days and nights, sleeping in those crude huts for drying chest nuts, made from stones and branches, that people call cannicci, alone with his dog or his gun, as far as Piedmont, as far as France, without ever leaving the woods, forcing open the path before him, that secret path that only he knew and that went through all the woods there were, that united all woods in one single wood, every wood in the world in a wood beyond all woods, every place in the world in a place beyond all places. You see how our roads diverged, my father's and my own, though I was like him in a way. For what was the road I sought if not a repeat of my father's, but tunneled from the depths of an other otherness, the upperworld (or hell) of humanity, what were my eyes seeking in the dimly lit porches of the night (sometimes the shadow of a woman would disappear inside) if not the half open door, the cinema screen to pass through, the page to turn that leads into a world where all words and shapes become real, present, my own experience, no longer the echo of an echo of an echo. 14</page><page sequence="6">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI Talking to each other was difficult. Both verbose by nature, possessed of an ocean of words, in each other's presence we be came mute, would walk in silence side by side along the road to San Giovanni. To my father's mind, words must serve as confirmations of things and as signs of possession; to mine they were foretastes of things barely glimpsed, not possessed, presumed. My father's vocabulary welled outward into the interminable catalogue of the genera, species, and varieties of the vegetable world-every name was a distinction plucked from the dense compactness of the for est in the belief that one had thus enlarged man's dominion-and into technical terminology, where the exactness of the word goes hand in hand with the studied exactness of the operation, the ges ture. And this whole Babel-like nomenclature was mashed up in an equally Babel-like idiomatic base, where various languages vied with each other, combining as need or memory dictated (dialect for anything local and blunt-he had an unusually rich dialect vocabulary, full of words no one used anymore; Spanish for things general and decorous-Mexico had been the backdrop to his most successful years; Italian for rhetoric-he was, in everything, a nineteenth-century man; English-he had been to Texas-for the practical side; French for jokes), the result being a conversational style all woven together with stock refrains promptly trotted out in response to familiar situations, exorcising the movements of the mind and forming once again a catalogue, parallel to that of his farming vocabulary-and to yet another catalogue of his, made up not of words this time but of whistles, twitters, trills, tu-whits and to-whoos, this arising from his great ability to mimic birdcalls, whether simply by pursing his lips or cupping his hands round his mouth in some particular way, or by using little whistles or gadgets that you blew into or that went off with a spring, a considerable as sortment of which he would carry around with him in his hunting jacket. I could recognize not a single plant or bird. The world of things was mute for me. The words that flowed and flowed inside my head weren't anchored to objects, but to emotions, fantasies, forebodings. And all it took was for a scrap of trampled news paper to find its way beneath my feet and I would be engrossed in soaking up the writing in it, mutilated and unmentionable names of theaters, actresses, useless things-and already my mind 15</page><page sequence="7">ITALO CAL VINO would be racing off, the sequence of images would go on for hours and hours as I walked silently behind my father, who might point to some leaves on the other side of a wall and say, "Ypotoglaxia jasminifolia" (I'm inventing the names; I never learned the real ones), "Photophila wolfoides," he would say (I'm inventing; they were names of this sort), or "Crotodendron indica" (of course I could perfectly well have looked up some real names, instead of in venting them, and maybe rediscovered what plants my father had actually been naming for me, but that would have been cheating, refusing to accept the loss that I inflicted on myself, the thousands of losses we inflict on ourselves and for which there is no making amends). (And yet, and yet, if I had written some real names of plants here it would have been a gesture of modesty and devotion on my part, finally resorting to that humble knowledge that my youth rejected in order to try my luck with other cards, novel and treacherous, it would have been a way of making peace with my father, a demonstration of maturity, and yet I didn't do it, I in dulged in this joke of invented names, this intended parody, sure sign that I am still resisting, arguing, sure sign that that morning march to San Giovanni is still going on, with its same discord, and that every morning of my life is still the morning when it's my turn to go with Father to San Giovanni.) We had to take turns going with my father to San Giovanni, one day me and one day my brother (not during school time, because then Mother wouldn't allow us to be distracted, but in the sum mer months, just when we could have slept late), to help him carry home the baskets of fruit and greens. (I'm talking about when we were bigger now, teenagers, and Father old; though Father always seemed to be the same age, between sixty and seventy, a dogged, tireless old age.) Summer and winter, he would get up at five, noisily pull on his farming clothes, lace up his leggings (he always dressed heavily, jacket and waistcoat whatever the season, mainly because he needed so many pockets for all the pruning shears and grafting knives and balls of string or raffia he always took with him; except that in summer he'd change his fustian huntingjacket and peaked cap with attached balaclava for faded yellow cloth fa tigues left over from Mexico days and a colonial lion hunter's hat), come into our room to wake us up, with gruff shouts and shoulder shaking, then go downstairs with his hobnail boots on the marble 1 6</page><page sequence="8">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI steps, wander round the empty house (Mother got up at six, then Grandmother, and last of all the maid and the cook), open the kitchen windows, heat up some coffee for himself, feed slops to the dog, talk to the dog, get together the baskets to be taken to San Giovanni, empty or with bags of seeds or insecticide or fertilizer in them (the noises sounded muffled to us in our semiconscious state, since no sooner had Father woken us up than we had fallen right back to sleep again), and already he would be opening the back door to the beudo, was out in the street, coughing and bring ing up phlegm summer and winter. We had managed to extract a tacit reprieve from our morning duty: instead of walking along with Father we would catch up with him in San Giovanni, half an hour or an hour later, so that his footsteps marching away up San Pietro hill were the sign that we still had a scrap of sleep to cling to. But immediately my mother came to wake us again. "Get up, get up, it's late, Dad went ages ago!" and she would open the windows on the palm trees rustling in the morning wind, pull the bedclothes off us, "Get up, get up, Dad's waiting for you to carry the baskets!" (No, it's not so much Mother's voice that comes back to me, in these pages echoing with my father's noisy and distant presence, but a silent authority she had: she looks out between these lines, then immediately with draws, is left in the margin; there, she came into our room and is gone, we didn't hear her leave and our sleep is over forever.) I must get dressed in a hurry, climb up to San Giovanni before my father starts back, laden. He always came back laden. It was a point of honor for him never to make the trip empty-handed. And since the proper road didn't go up as far as San Giovanni, there was no other way of get ting the produce home than to carry it by hand (our hands, that is, since a laborer's time costs money and can't be thrown away, and when the women go to market they are already loaded up with things to sell). (True, there had once been-but this is a memory from earlier childhood-Giua the muleteer with his wife Bianca and mule Bianchina, but Bianchina the mule had been dead a long time, and Giu'a had gotten a hernia, though old Bianca is still alive today as I write.) Usually it was toward half past nine or ten that my father got back from his morning trip: you would hear his footsteps along the beudo, heavier than when he set out, a bang on 1 7</page><page sequence="9">ITALO CAL VINO the kitchen door (he didn't ring the bell because he had his hands full, or perhaps more out of a kind of declaration, of emphasis of his coming back laden), and you would see him come in with a basket under each arm, or a hamper, and a haversack on his back or even a pannier, and the kitchen would suddenly be swimming in greens and fruit, there was always more than one family could eat (I'm talking here about the times of plenty, before the war, before tending the land became almost the only means of getting the food we needed), and my mother would disapprove, worried as ever that nothing should be wasted: things, time, energy. (That life is partly waste was something my mother would not accept: I mean that it is partly passion. Hence she never left the garden where every plant was labeled, the house swathed in bougainvillea, the study with its herbariums and the microscope under the glass dome. Always sure of herself, methodical, she transformed passions into duties and lived on those. But what pushed my father up the road to San Giovanni every morning and me downward along my own road-was not so much the duty of the hardworking landowner, the altruism of the agricul tural innovator-and in my case not so much those definitions of duty that I would gradually impose on myself-but passion, fierce passion, pain of existence-what else could have forced him to scramble up through woods and wilderness and me to plunge into a labyrinth of walls and printed paper?-desperate confrontation with that which lies outside ourselves, waste of self set against the waste of the world in general.) My father never attempted to save energy, only time: he wouldn't shirk the steeper slope if it was the shorter. Depend ing on what stretches of mule track you chose, what shortcuts and bridges, there were all kinds of ways of getting from our house to San Giovanni: the route my father took was doubtless the re sult of long experience and numerous improvements and second thoughts; but by now it had become like the stairs at home, a series of steps you could climb with your eyes closed, taking up barely an instant of mental space, as if impatience had abolished both distance and effort. He need only think: "Now I'll go to San Giovanni" (he'd suddenly remembered that a strip of Jerusalem artichokes hadn't been watered, that some aubergine seeds should be sprouting their first leaves), and it was as if he'd already been 18</page><page sequence="10">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI transported there, already he was seething inside with the scolding he was planning to give his workers or day laborers and the words would be bursting from his breast in an avalanche of insults for men and women alike, insults whose obscenity had lost all warmth of complicity to become as austere and compact as a stone wall. This impatience, this intolerance at finding himself anywhere but on his own land, would sometimes seize him halfway through the day, when he'd already gotten back from his regular morning in spection at San Giovanni and changed into his town clothes, his starched collar, the waistcoat with the silver chain, a red fez he had bought in Tripolitania and wore in the house and the office to cover his bald head, and all of a sudden, in the middle of do ing something else, he would think-because it was the estate that was always on his mind-of some job that hadn't been finished up at San Giovanni or that hadn't been done properly or of some worker who for lack of instructions might be standing idle, and immediately we would see him get up from his desk, go upstairs to his room, come down all togged up from hunting hat to leggings, untie the dog, and go out by the door to the beudo, even in the hottest moments of a summer afternoon, staring straight ahead of him, the sun beating down. From the beudo you went out onto the brick and cobblestone steps of Salita San Pietro. Here you would meet old folks from the Giovanni Marsaglia Home in their gray caps with red initials (including, as everybody knew, Russian princes fallen upon hard times, lords who had gambled away fortunes on the Riviera), and nuns leading lines of little girls from the holiday camps for the Milanese, and people climbing up to visit sick relatives in the New Hospital. The housing in this area-there was a stretch of paved road now-was the result of various stages of sedimenta tion: like everywhere else, the place had once been a stretch of fields watched over by farmhouses; then at the turn of the cen tury a few expensive villas had sprung up, their gardens waving with palms, like the house we lived in (my parents' first purchase on their return from America) and another a little farther up the hill, built Indian-style, all spindly steeples and domes, called "Palais d'Agra" (a name I always found mysterious until I read Kipling's Kim), and yet another converted into a municipal quarantine sta tion, its shutters always closed; later on, the wealthy residential 19</page><page sequence="11">ITALO CAL VINO districts of the town moved elsewhere and the area was taken over by more modest little houses, homely cottages with small pieces of land used for seedbeds and sheds for chickens or rabbits. So that as far as the Baragallo bridge you were walking through a district that was half rural but already under fierce attack from the town, the remains of the traditional agricultural life (an old olive mill where water and moss roared on rusted wheels; a winery, stained pur ple, with vats and presses) rubbing shoulders with garages, flower wholesalers, sawmills, brick storage yards, an electric-power plant full of windows that loomed bright, empty, and humming in the mornings before dawn, and beyond all these the huge rectangle of the housing project, first and only completed lot of a planned village, an "achievement of the Regime" begun with enthusiasm and left without sequel, but sufficing to remind you that this was already the Europe of the masses. At the Baragallo bridge we would leave the road, which went on toward Madonna della Costa (we walked that way only when we went to see Uncle Quirino, nicknamed Titin, in the Calvinos' eighteenth-century house, its old pink stucco rising from a gray cloud of olive trees on top of the hill where my great-grandparents had once had their brick kilns), and follow the river. Immediately something changed, and the first sign of it was this: that as far as Baragallo, people, like people on suburban streets anywhere, didn't so much as look at one another, whereas after Baragallo everybody greeted everybody else as they passed by, even people they didn't know, with a loud "Mornin'," or some other generic expression indicating recognition of the existence of their fellow man, like: "Keep it up, keep it up," or "Aren't we carrying a lot today," or a comment on the weather, "Looks like rain to me," messages of consideration and friendship full of discretion, spo ken as they went along, without stopping, almost to themselves, barely raising their eyes. My father too would change after Bara gallo; that nervous impatience that had marked his step so far would disappear, likewise his irritation when he shouted at the dog or tugged at it if he had it on the leash; now he would look around more calmly, the dog would usually be let loose and the shouts and whistles and fingersnapping directed at it were more good-natured, almost affectionate even. This sense of being back in more sequestered and familiar places had its effect on me too, 20</page><page sequence="12">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI 'iIVN~</page><page sequence="13">ITALO CAL VINO but along with it I would also feel uneasy at no longer being able to think of myself as the anonymous passerby of the street; from now on I was "one of the professor's boys," subjected to the scrutiny of every eye. Beyond a wooden fence pigs shrieked and fought with each other (an unusual sight in our part of the world), bred by a Pied montese family who had set up the kind of dairy farm typical of their home country. (On the way up we would already have passed by old Spirito driving his cart loaded with milk churns for his cus tomers.) Opposite the pig farm the road gave onto a rocky stream, and there would be a row of women leaning over a sort of long raised trough washing clothes. Farther on you could choose be tween two different paths, depending on whether or not you went back across the river on an ancient humpbacked bridge. If you didn't go over the bridge you followed some ditches and short cuts running beside strips of farmland until you reached the San Giovanni mule track via a flight of recently built (or restored) steps that climbed so sharply and steeply in bright sunlight it took your breath away. (After the last war, someone wrote an obscenity in huge tarred letters on a wall at the top of the steps, in mock ery of those climbing up carrying things, perhaps to reawaken an instinct of rebellion, or just seeking confirmation of his own hopelessness.) The mule track pushed on toward San Giovanni on the flat for a good while; the sea was behind us; on the other side of the river, the Tasciaire bank was slashed by a huge long gorge, testimony to an old landslide and blue in the splintered, earth-colored stone. From one particular bend onward you'd be able to see the little valley of San Giovanni opening up obliquely from the end of the main valley and so sharply lit that you could make out each separate strip of land and-where the olives didn't cloud your view-who was working there, and the smoke from the red roofs of the barns. We liked to use this route going down; climbing up we found the other more attractive: having crossed the bridge, you climbed the hill up the Tasciaire mule track, likewise steep and exposed to the sun, but twisting and varied and paved with old, crooked, worn-out stones, so that it seemed painless and familiar by com parison. Then you left the track to follow a long beudo that ran across the side of the valley halfway up, just below that huge gorge 22</page><page sequence="14">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI you could see from the other side. The beudo was raised over the farmed strips and you had to watch your step so as not to slip and sometimes you had to hang on to the crooked, bulging wall beside. The dog usually found that the safest way to go was in the ditch, padding along in the water. Here and there fig trees rose from the strips on either side and a green shadow shaded the beudo; some farmhouses had been built right up against it and walking along you were almost inside them, mixed up in the lives of those families, all out at work since dawn, women and men and children digging the earth of their strip with dull blows from their magaiu (a three-pronged fork), or using their magaiu again to "turn in the water," which meant knocking down the earth bank of the ditch and building other banks to lead the water twisting and turning through their seedbeds. Farther on, the beudo disappeared into a dense thicket of rust ling reeds, and we had reached the river. This had to be forded with a zigzag of jumps across white stepping-stones following a pattern we knew by heart but which could always change when rainy days swelled the river and carried off one of the stones. Climbing up away from the river you cut across between the strips along private paths till you reached a shortcut that was itself half a stream, and as with the other path you now joined the San Giovanni mule track, but at a point much farther on. The nearer we got to San Giovanni, the more my father would be overcome by a new tension, which wasn't just a last burst of impatience to arrive at the only place he felt was his own, but also a sort of remorse at having been away for so long, his conviction that something must have been lost or have gone wrong during his absence, his urgency to cancel out everything in his life that was not San Giovanni, and at the same time a feeling that since San Giovanni was not the whole world but merely a corner of the world besieged by the rest, it would always spell despair for him. But all it took was for someone at the top of a strip, pruning or spreading sulphate on the vines, to call down, "Professore, if you please, could I ask you a question?" and go on to ask advice about mixtures of fertilizers, the best time to make graftings, or about insecticides or the new seeds the Farming Consortium had in, and my father would stop and, cheering up, relaxing, exclamatory, a bit long-winded, explain the whys and wherefores. In short, all he 23</page><page sequence="15">ITALO CAL VINO wanted was a sign that civil cohabitation was possible in this world of his, a cohabitation prompted by a passion for improvement and informed by natural reason; but then he would immediately be oppressed again by reminders that all was precarious and be set by danger and once more the fury was upon him. And one of these reminders was myself, the fact that I belonged to that other, metropolitan and hostile part of the world, the painful awareness that he couldn't count on his children to consolidate this ideal San Giovanni civilization of his, which thus had no future. So that the last stretch of the path was covered in an unwarranted hurry, as though it were the edge of a blanket he could use to tuck him self away inside San Giovanni; and hurrying along like this we went by a decrepit olive mill inhabited by two even more decrepit old women, over the concrete bridge that went back across the river (the track began to climb a little again here), past Regin's house-he was a relative of ours and a customs officer whose dog would resume an interminable quarrel with our own, barking and leaping up (the track became steep here)-through the field of another relative, Bartumelin, who had spent his youth in Peru (his wife, whom we saw rinsing clothes in the washing trough, was a Peruvian Indian, a fat woman exactly like our own local women both in features and in speech) (and here we began the last part of the climb, the steepest), past the field of two lanky muleteers who at some point replaced their mule with a stocky draft ox... My father's breast heaved not with tiredness but with insults and scoldings: we had arrived at San Giovanni, now we were on home ground. What I ought to do now is recount every step and every gesture and every change of mood there on our land, except that every thing loses its precision in my memory at this point, as if, having reached the end of our climb with its rosary of images, I would become wrapped in a kind of bewildered limbo, which lasted until it was time to pick up the baskets and set off down the path back home. I've already said that our daily duty consisted above all in helping father to bring back the baskets. Or rather, we were sup posed to help him with everything, so as to learn how to run an estate, so as to be like him, as sons ought to be like their fathers, but soon both he and we understood that we weren't going to learn anything, and the idea of training us for the farm was tacitly 24</page><page sequence="16">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI dropped, or put off until we were older and wiser, as if we had been granted an extension to our childhood. Hence carrying the baskets was the only thing that was certain, the only duty accepted as undeniably necessary. The job wasn't, I should say, without its pleasure: having carefully balanced my load, a wicker pannier on my back, a basket under one arm-hopefully the other arm would be free, so the weight could be swapped about-I would set off, head down, with a kind of fury, a bit like my father; and as I walked, relieved of any duty to pay attention to the world around me or to decide what I was doing, all my energy being employed in the effort of getting my load home and planting my feet along a path unchanging as a train track, my mind was at once protected and free to wander where it would. We plunged ourselves into this "humper's" task with exaggerated effort, myself, my brother, and my father too; since for him as for us it seemed it was no longer the creativity of growing things, the experimentation and the risk that drew him to San Giovanni, so much as the transportation and accu mulation of things, this antlike toiling, a question of life or death (and in fact it almost was that now: the interminable years of the war had begun; amid the general penury, our family had, thanks to the land in San Giovanni, entered a phase of agricultural self sufficiency, or "autarky," as they used to say then), and if we weren't there to help him Father would come down overloaded-"like a mule" was the traditional image-flaunting his burden, perhaps partly so as to have our desertion weigh on us; but even if one or both of his sons went with him, we would all come down equally laden, bowlegged, mute, gazing at the ground, each absorbed in his own thoughts, inscrutable. Our gloom was at odds with the generous contents of our bas kets. These were concealed (with that typical peasant diffidence toward prying eyes) under a layer of broad vine or fig leaves, yet with our swaying steps the loose covering would get lost along the way and the green trunks of zucchini would emerge, the "nun's thigh" pears and the bunches of SaintJeannet grapes, the first figs, the tough down of the chayote, the purple-green spines of the arti chokes, the cobs of sweet corn to boil and munch on, the potatoes, the tomatoes, the big bottles of milk and wine, and sometimes a spindly rabbit, already skinned, with everything being carefully ar ranged so that the hard things wouldn't bruise the soft and there 25</page><page sequence="17">ITALO CAL VINO was still enough space left for a bunch of oregano, or sweet majo ram or basil. (To my distracted eyes those baskets seemed insignifi icant then, as the basic materials of life always seem banal to the young, yet now that I have but a smooth sheet of white paper in their place, I struggle to fill them with name upon name, to cram them with words, and in remembering and arranging these names I spend more time than I spent gathering and arranging the things themselves, more passion... -no, not true: I imagined as I set out to describe the baskets that I would reach the crowning moment of my regret, and instead nothing, what came out was a cold, pre dictable list: and it's pointless my trying to kindle a halo of feeling behind it with these words of commentary: all remains as it was then, those baskets were already dead then and I knew it, ghosts of a concreteness that had already disappeared, and I was already what I am, a citizen of cities and of history-still without either city or history and suffering for it-a consumer-and victim-of industrial products-a candidate for consumerism, a freshly desig nated victim-and already the lots were cast, all the lots, our own and everybody else's, yet what was this morning fury of my child hood, the fury that still persists in these not entirely sincere pages? Could everything perhaps have been different-not very different but just enough to make the difference-if those baskets hadn't even then been so alien to me, if the rift between myself and my father hadn't been so deep? Might everything that is happening now perhaps have taken a different slant, in the world, in the his tory of civilization-the losses not have been so absolute, the gains so uncertain?) The table where we laid the fruit and vegetables and filled the baskets to take back home was under the fig tree next to the old Cadorso farmhouse where the farm stewards' family lived and where the faded Masonic emblem that the old Calvinos used to put on their houses was still visible over the door. Our vineyard took up the lower part of the estate, with fruit trees planted between the rows of vines; farther up were the grapefruit trees, and above them the olives. And there, in the shade of the tall green avocado (or aguacate) plants, the apple of my father's eye, was the house he had built himself, the "villa" where we would live through the worst days of the war, with a model cellar and a stall for white Swiss goats on the ground floor. Our property ended at the piazza with 26</page><page sequence="18">THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI the church of San Giovanni (where every twenty-fourth of June they would hoist the greasy pole and the town band would play), then began again on the other side after a stretch of mule track, taking in a whole small valley that had a plantation of palms for fu neral wreaths at the bottom, then fruit and greens farther up, with a farmhouse known as Cason Bianco (where we kept sheep for a while), and a spring hidden among rocks green with maidenhair fern, and a limestone cavern, and a rock cave, and a fish pond, and other wonders, which were no longer wonders for me but have once again become so, now that in place of all this, stretching away in squalid and ferocious geometry, with neatly squared walls and terraces all at the same inclination, stands a carnation plantation, gray expanse of stalks in a grid of poles and wires, opaque glass of greenhouses, cylindrical cement tanks, and everything that once was has vanished, everything that seemed to be there but was al ready only an illusion, an unaccountable stay of execution. Since it was in the shade for part of the day, the valley of San Giovanni was at that time thought to be unsuitable for the mass cul tivation of flowers and hence had preserved the traditional look of the countryside. And likewise all the farms my father walked through every morning, as if he had chosen the route on purpose to avoid the uniform gray expanses of the carnation fields that now hemmed in the city from Poggio to Coldirodi, as if, despite working professionally in the floriculture business himself, he felt secretly remorseful about it, realized that this thing he had hoped and worked for did, yes, mean economic and technical progress for our backward agriculture, but also destruction of wholeness and harmony, loss of variety, subordination to money. And that was why he separated those hours in San Giovanni from the rest of his day, why he tried to set up a modern estate that wouldn't be hostage to a monoculture, made investments whose recovery was always uncertain, increasing the number of crops, the imported varieties, the irrigation piping, all so as to find some other way forward he could offer, one that would preserve both the spirit of the place and the drive for progress. What he wanted to achieve was a relationship with nature, one of struggle and dominion: to get his hands on nature, to change it, to mold it, while still feeling it alive and whole beneath. And me? I imagined my mind was elsewhere. What was nature? 27</page><page sequence="19">ITALO CAL VINO Grass, plants, green places, animals. I lived in the midst of it and wanted to be elsewhere. When it came to nature, I was cold, re served, sometimes hostile. I didn't realize that I too was seeking a relationship, more fortunate than my father's, a relationship that literature would give me, restoring meaning to everything, so that all at once everything would become true and tangible and posses sable and perfect, everything in a world that was already lost. Where is it my father's shouting from, telling me to bring the hose and do some watering, with everything so dry? From one strip comes the sound of old Sciaguato's fork thumping and thumping in the earth. Something is moving up in those trees: Mumina's girl has climbed up to pick a basket of cherries. I run over with the hose coiled on my shoulder, but I can't see my father among the rows of plants and I get the wrong strip. I have to bring the hook for pulling down the branches of the cherry tree, the sul phate dispenser, the sticky tape for grafting, but I don't know my own land, I get lost. (Now, from the vantage point of hindsight, I can see every strip, every path, now I could point out the way for myself as I run through the vines, but it's too late now, everybody's gone now.) I wish the baskets were already packed, so that we could get on home and go to the sea. The sea is over there, in a triangular cleft in the valley, V-shaped; but it's as if it were miles and miles away, the sea alien to my father and to all the people we meet on our morning walks. Now we're walking home. I'm bowed down under my pannier. The sun is high; from the nearest paved road, on San Giacomo Hill, comes the drone of a truck; here in the valley the gray of the olives and the chuckle of the stream deaden color and sound. On the slope opposite smoke rises from the earth: someone has lit a stubble fire. My father is talking about the way olive trees blos som. I'm not listening. I look at the sea and think I'll be down on the beach in an hour. On the beach the girls toss balls with their smooth arms, they dive into the sparkle, shout, splash, on scores of canoes and pedalboats. 28</page></plain_text>
