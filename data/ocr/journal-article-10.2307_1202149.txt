<plain_text><page sequence="1">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology* Alexander Altmann The chasm that divides Jewish from Christian theology manifests itself most clearly in the interpretation of topics which, at first blush, might seem to provide common ground between the two religions. A case in point is the biblical theme of man's creation in the image of God. Jewish and Christian exegetes alike will agree that in the context of Genesis, chapter I, the homo imago Dei motif is to be understood as an emphatic affirmation of man's dignity and pre-eminence over the rest of creation. Both sides will concede that Psalm 8:5-9 represents a spelling out of this concept in poetic terms: " Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor." Yet here agreement ends. Theological considerations enter, and discrepancies arise. The gulf widens as the original concept is linked, on the Christian side, with the figure of Jesus, the doctrine of original sin, and the trinitarian dogma. From Paul's Epistles down to Luther and Calvin, the Christian interpretation of homo imago Dei passed through a variety of stages of development, and so did the Jewish treatment of the theme from the tannaitic period down to the medieval philosophers and mystics. Historical conditions prevented a continuous dialogue across the fence, but there were occasional exchanges of a polemical nature, and beneath many a rabbinic utterance one may discern a silent reference to Christian doctrine. I shall endeavor to trace the broad outline of the ways in which the theme was understood in the two traditions. Turning first to rabbinic sources, we note a certain reluctance to define the meaning of the phrase "image of God." This is particularly evident in the Aramaic versions of the Pentateuch. The oldest of these, the Targum Yerushalmi discovered by A. Diez Macho and dated by him as pre-Christian, fights shy of rendering the term zelem, "image," * Paper delivered at a plenary session of the Colloquium on Judaism and Christianity arranged by Harvard University Divinity School in October, 1966. 235</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion by .alma' or similar Aramaic equivalents and uses instead the more innocuous term demfit or demre, "similitude," which carries with it the association of imitatio Dei, rather than any anthropomorphic concept of God. Since Genesis I :26 speaks of both zelem and demi7t (" Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"), this Targum translates the second term by the synonymous phrase kad nafaq ken, meaning "in similar fashion." ' In verse 27, where the term .elem occurs twice, demzt and dema are used in the Aramaic version, and in order to avert any suggestion of anthropomorphism, be-.elem Elohim (" in the image of God") is rendered bi-dem min qadam YT' ("in a similitude from before the Lord"). The same turn of phrase is used in rendering Genesis 5:1 (where the Hebrew text itself has bi-demfit Elohim) and Genesis 9:6 (where the Hebrew text has again be-zelem Elohim).2 The position is not very different in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan ben cUzi'el, which incorporates a great deal of midrashic material and is therefore more of an elaborate paraphrase than a straightforward translation. It, too, avoids as far as possible the term "image" (.alma') and replaces it by deyoqna', which corresponds to the Hebrew demfit, "similitude," as is evident from the paraphrase of Genesis I :26, where ki-demlltena (" after our likeness") is rendered bi-deyoqndna'. In that particular verse Pseudo-Jonathan has no hesitation translating be-.almenu by be- zalmdna', because God's words are presented as an address to the ministering angels, the implication being that man was to be created in the image of the angels. In Genesis I :27, however, be-zalmo is trans- lated by be-deyoqneh, "in His similitude," and this term is used again, not only in the rendering of Genesis 5:i, where the Hebrew has bi- demft Elohim, but also in Genesis 9:6, where the Hebrew has be-zelem Elohim. Pseudo-Jonathan's term deyoqna' thus seems to correspond to the 1 We-'amar rY nibra' bar nash bi-demuitenu kad nafaq ken. Likewise Gen. 5:3 kad nafaq bah (the phrase which has its equivalent in the idiomatic form ka-yozeD bj in mishnaic Hebrew). 2 A. Diez Macho announced the discovery of the old Palestinian Targum in Sefarad, XVII (I957), 119-21, and in the Supplement to the Oxford Congress of Vetus Testamentum (i959). His dating of the text as pre-Christian was challenged by Roger Le D6aut and defended by Diez Macho in Sefarad, XX (1960), 3 ff. Since the text has not yet been published, I consulted the manuscript Neofiti I of the Vatican Hebrew Manuscripts, which constitutes Diez Macho's text, in the microfilm collection of Hebrew Vaticana at the Goldfarb Library of Brandeis University. The significance of this text and its possible relation to the other Aramaic versions are discussed by Paul Kahle in Zeitschriftfiir die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, XLIX (1958), o4 ff., and in his The Cairo Geniza (2 ed.; New York: Oxford University Press, 1959), PP. 201 ff. 236</page><page sequence="3">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology old Targum Yerushalmi's demit or demsi. In both Aramaic versions we have, therefore, evidence of the tendency to avoid speaking of the "image of God," while both have apparently no objection to using the phrase "similitude of God." 3 The only innovation found in Pseudo- Jonathan occurs in the rendering of be-zelem Elohim bara' 't by be- zalma' TY bera' yateh ("in an image the Lord created him")-in other words, by making Elohim the subject of the clause and separating it from be-zelem. The translator obviously wanted to retain the phrase ;elem (zalma') and yet not incur any suspicion of anthropomorphism. Hence he interpreted the phrase in question to mean that God created man in some image specific to him alone. Abraham Geiger, who dealt with this subject extensively over a hundred years ago,4 related this interpretation to the way in which the Greek version of Symmachus paraphrased the text of Genesis I1:27 "And God created man in a superior image, upright created He him... ." , Whether Symmachus was an Ebionite, as is widely assumed, or a Jew, as Geiger claimed, he seems to follow a definite trend in rabbinic exegesis. Targum Onqelos may be claimed, with Geiger, as a representative of this particular exegesis. Both the Sabbioneta text of Onqelos published by Abraham Berliner (Berlin, 1884) and the recent critical edition by Alexander Sperber6 leave the phrase be-.elem (bi-demat) Elohim in Genesis I :27, 5:I, and 9:6 untranslated in the original Hebrew, as if the translator did not wish to tamper with the text.7 Normally one would have expected to find the translation be-.alma' da-YT'. There are two anomalies here: first, zelem is left in its Hebrew form, and, second, the Divine name Elohim which Onqelos invariably renders by the Tetragrammaton wherever that name stands by itself (that is, uncombined with the Tetragrammaton) 8 is left here unchanged. The reason for Onqelos' procedure may be simply due to a desire to refrain from meddling with a phrase so much charged with theological ambiguity. It is also possible that by Elohim he understood here the 3 Cf. the passages collected by J.

He could not have done so expressly, since his version is a literal one, but the midrashic exegesis may have been presupposed. There is a third possibility, and it is this one which was seized upon by Geiger. Like Pseudo-Jonathan and Symmachus, Onqelos may have separated be-zelem (bi-demat) from Elohim and understood the clause to signify: "In a specific image God created him." Geiger was able to cite in support of his interpretation of Onqelos no less an authority than Don Isaac Abrabanel, who in his (second) Letter to Sha'ul Ha-Kohen wrote as follows:9 You can see that Onqelos translated the [word] zelem mentioned in Scripture always as separate and not combined with Him, blessed be He. For he rendered be-zelem Elohim bara' tW by be-zalma' Y' cabadyateh ; and he rendered likewise ki be-zelem Elohim Casah et ha-'adam by be-zalma' T' cabadyat Denasha': and Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra of blessed memory alluded to this when he mentioned the view referred to.10 Obviously, Abrabanel's text for Targum Onqelos differed from the one offered in Berliner's and Sperber's editions, yet not only is it compatible with the exegesis suggested by Geiger but it leaves no other alternative. For, by rendering be-gelem Elohim as be-.alma' T' and not, as one might have expected, as be-.alma' da-T', one has to assume that the translator did indeed deliberately "separate" the word God from the word image and made the clause to read: "In an image God created him." Nor can the existence of an exegetical tradition to this effect be denied. Ibn Ezra makes specific reference to it in his Commentary on Genesis 1: 26: Some say that the word nacaseh [usually translated "Let us make"] is the participle of the nifCal [passive form of the verb] as in Nehemiah 5:18. And they say that be-zalmenu ki-dematenza ("in our image," "after our likeness") were Moses' words. And they interpret [the words] "And God created man in his image" in the sense that "his" refers to "man." And they interpret be-zelem Elohim in the sense that "God" is connected with "created" so as to say that God created man in "an image." The same interpretation is attested in almost identical words by Aaron ben Elijah of Nicomedia, the Karaite exegete and philosopher of 9 Abrabanel, She elot Sha ul Ha-Kohen (Venice, 1574), fol. I2b. 10 See Ibn Ezra's Commentary on Gen. I:26. 238</page><page sequence="5">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology the fourteenth century, in his Keter Torah." According to Geiger, this particular exegesis may go back to Rabbi cAqiba's logion in Mishnah Abot 3:I4: " He used to say: Beloved is man for he was created in the image; still greater was the love in that it was made known to him that he was created in the image, as it is written, 'For in an image God made him.' " Geiger pointed out that if the verse quoted had been adduced to support the view that man was created in the image of God, Rabbi cAqiba should have used the expression, "Beloved is man for he was created in the image of God." He might also have quoted Genesis I :27 rather than Genesis 9:6. He chose, however, advisedly, Geiger suggests, the latter verse because its construction lends itself more easily to a separation of be-zelem and Elohim, the subject being otherwise missing.12 It seems, however, highly doubtful whether this is not pressing matters too far. Most probably, Rabbi cAqiba used the term "in the image" (ba- zelem) as an abbreviated form for "in the image of God" in the same way in which he and others employed the term ha-demait as a shortened form for man's "similitude to God." 13 In Abot de-Rabbi Natan, Rabbi cAqiba's logion appears shorn of its second part in the name of Rabbi Meir, and there it reads: "Beloved is man for he was created in the image of God (be-zelem Elohim)... .." 14 It is hardly plausible that Rabbi Meir differed from his teacher Rabbi cAqiba in the interpretation of Genesis 9:6. Geiger's sweeping thesis is therefore far from convincing. Besides, Rabbi cAqiba could not have originated this type of exegesis, as Geiger surmised,15 because it is already found in the old Targum Yerushalmi, which is pre-Christian. The radically anti-anthropo- morphic interpretation which separates the notion of "image" from that of God is thus confined to the Aramaic versions and to a line of tradition which most probably was taken over by the Karaites, as may be inferred from the reference to it in Aaron ben Elijah's Keter Torah.16 This is, however, not to say that other circles were less concerned about the theological implications of the image concept.

Their reaction to prophetic passages, such as Ezekiel I :26 and Daniel 8:16, is summed up in the statement: "Great is the power of the prophets who compare the form to its Former! "17 In sharp contrast to the circumspect manner in which the Aramaic versions deal with the homo imago Dei passages, the Greek translations, with the exception of Symmachus, render the text literally.'s For a hellenistic Jew like Philo of Alexandria, the text carried Platonic over- tones and thereby enabled him to conceptualize the "image" motif. When reading in the Septuagint version of Genesis I: 26: kai eipen ho Theos* poijsjmen anthr6pon kat' eikona himeteran, kai kath' homoiisin, he could not help being reminded of Plato's use of the term eikin (image). He therefore did not try to circumvent the full implications of this term but worked out an elaborate exegesis built on it.19 For Plato the whole of the sensible world is an "image" of the "ideas." For Philo, too, the sensible world is an image of the ideas, but the ideas, or the Logos (which represents the totality of the ideas), are themselves but an image of God who is their "pattern" (paradeigma) and "archetype" (arche- typos). The world perceived by our senses is, therefore, but "an image of an image." 20 The creation of man "after the image of God " Philo takes to mean that man is not an immediate image of God but is made after the immediate image, which is the Logos.21 He distinguishes between the man whose creation in the image of the Logos is described in Genesis, chapter I, and the man whose formation is narrated in Genesis, chapter 2: "There are two types of men; the one a heavenly man, the other an earthly. The heavenly man, being made after the image of God, is altogether without part or lot in corruptible and 17 Genesis Rabba 27:1. For parallel passages, see the note in J.

Orlinsky's conclusion concerning the treatment of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms by the LXX translators of the Pentateuch, Isaiah and Job: They reproduced the Hebrew terms literally and correctly (see HUCA, XXVII [1956], 200; XXX [1959], i53 ff.; and Arthur Soffer's discussion of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms in the Septuagint of Psalms in HUCA, XXVIII [1957], 85 ff-).

In the first place, the Logos is called " the archetypal seal," 26 " the seal of the universe," 27 "the original seal" of which intelligible and incorporeal man is a "copy." 28 Yet the heavenly man too is called "an idea or type or seal" because the earthly man is modeled after him. Moreover, Philo speaks of a "form which God has stamped on the soul as on the tested coin." 29 A combination of these two motifs, namely, that of the seal and that of the coin, appears in the Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5, where it is used precisely in the context of the homo imago Dei concept, as is also the case in Philo. The parallel passage in the Tosefta 30 quoted in the Talmudic discussion. Sanhedrin 38a quotes Job 38:14 as proof text. It is, how- ever, clear that the idea did not originate from an exegesis of this biblical verse but stems from elsewhere. Professor Yizhaq Baer suggested that the Mishnah concerned reflects direct Platonic influence, and he cites a number of passages from Plato's writings in which the terms "seal" (sphragis) and "impression" (typos) are said to occur as equi- valents of "idea."31 On closer inspection of the passages quoted, it appears, however, that nowhere is the noun "seal" used as such. Only verbal forms of this word occur, and they, as well as the noun "impres- sion," are used, as Baer himself mentions, only in contexts dealing with 22 Legum Allegoria I, chap. xii, 31 ifE 23 De Opificio Mundi XLVI, '34- 24 Quod Deterius Potiori Insidiari Soleat XXII, 83-84 ; Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesin I, 4. 25 Ibid. 26 De Opificio Mundi VI, 25. 27 De Mutatione Nominum XXIII, I35. 28 Quaestiones (see n. 24), I, 4. 29 Legum Allegoria.

The motif of the "coin" is not mentioned at all. It seems more than unlikely that the rabbis of the early tannaitic period borrowed their similes in Sanhedrin 4"5 from Platonic passages completely unrelated to the concept of man's creation in the image of God. They obviously drew on the passages in Philo and, in this indirect way, allowed the Platonic notion of "image" to enter and shape their thinking. In so doing, they not only absorbed Platonic material that had filtered through Philo's mind but considerably enriched it by the manner of its presentation. The Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5 contains a peroration to be addressed to witnesses in a court trial that may involve the death penalty of the accused. The theme of the peroration is the worth and dignity of the individual human being, and the witnesses are cautioned against testifying without absolute certainty of the facts. They are reminded that " Man was created as a single being in order to teach [us] that one who destroys one person is considered as having, as it were, destroyed a whole world, and [that] one who preserves one person has, as it were, preserved a whole world . . .; in order [also] to tell of the greatness of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, for a man stamps many coins with one seal, and all of them are alike, and the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, stamped all men with the seal of the first Adam, and no one is like the other. Hence every one is obliged to say: For my sake the world was created...",32 The term " the seal of the first Adam " (jhtamj shel Adam ha-ri'shin), as well as the simile of the coin, is here used in the same sense in which Philo speaks of the heavenly man or reason which is created after God's image as a seal impressed on the earthly man and stamped on the soul (of every individual man) as on a coin. To be sure, there is no mention in the Mishnah of Philo's elaborate distinctions between God as the arche- typal pattern, the Logos as God's image, heavenly man as the image of the image, and earthly man as stamped with the latter. The Logos concept was certainly absent from the rabbinic mind as expressed in the mishnaic formulation. The term " seal of the first Adam" does, however, imply the other three concepts, that is, God as the archetypal pattern, Adam as an ideal type, and earthly man. This is how Rashi (I040-I I05), in his Commentary on Genesis I:27, understood the Mishnah and the parallel text in the Tosefta. Man, he says, "was made by a seal like a coin that is made by an impression" (rishem), and the image (of this 32 On the authenticity of the text as quoted here, see Baer, ibid., p. 22. n. 55. 242</page><page sequence="9">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology "coin") that "was prepared for him" was "an image in the similitude of his Creator" (zelem deyoqanyjzerj).33 What is entirely new and highly characteristic of the rabbinic mind is the emphasis on the diversity of men and on the value of each individual as a unique exemplar of humanity. It is also noteworthy that the peroration addressed to wit- nesses in a case where human life is at stake takes its cue from Genesis 9:6: "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man." The Mishnah thus accepted the homo imago Dei concept in its Philonic and, ultimately, Platonic sense, but rather than dwell on its theological implications, it put it to good use in the context of Halakah. It was made to serve as a reminder of the dignity and value of each human individual. It was also used as an argument against celibacy and thereby was again placed within the framework of Halak'ah. One who refrains from begetting children and from perpetuating the human species "dimi- nishes," according to Rabbi Eliezer, "the similitude" or Divine image on earth (memac~t et ha-demft), for the words (Genesis 9:6) speaking of man as the image of God are immediately followed by the command- ment (verse 7): "And you, be ye fruitful and multiply."34 A further instance of halakic use of the image motif is the way in which the biblical law in Deuteronomy 21:23 and the motivation of it as ex- pressed in the same verse are linked with the notion of respect, even for the corpse of a criminld, since every man bears a "similitude" or "resemblance" to God.35 It is obvious that what mattered to the rabbis was the possibility of translating the imago Dei concept into halakic categories, to put it in pragmatic rather than theological terms. We may note in rabbinic sources yet another trend in the interpreta- tion of the homo imago Dei motif, traces of which we have already found in Philo's concept of the heavenly man. This strand of rabbinic thinking 33 Lit., "an image of the similitude of his Creator," which might suggest the inter- position of an immediate image (similitude) between the Creator and man as the image of the immediate image. This would amount to the Philonic concept of man as an image of the Logos, but it is unlikely that Rashi held such a view. It should be noted, on the other hand, that Rashi interpreted the words "God created man in his image" also in a manner reminiscent of the Aramaic versions and the exegesis quoted (and rejected) by both Ibn Ezra and Aaron ben Elijah: "in a form (defas, typos) made [especially] for him." Baer, who quotes this Rashi passage, wonders in what source Rashi may have found a combination of these different motifs. 34 Tosefta, Yebamot 8:4; Talmud, Yebamot 63b. 35 Tosefta, Sanhedrin 9:7; Talmud, Sanhedrin 46b; Pseudo-Jonathan ben cUziel to Deut. 21:23. Rashi's Commentary on this verse combines all the source material mentioned. 243</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion is, however, purely haggadic and cannot be said to have had, within early Judaism, any theological, let alone halakic, significance. It assumed theological importance only late, in medieval Kabbalah, which saw in the Adam Qadmon a symbol of the Divine realm of the Sefirot. The description of the dimensions of Adam's stature and of his beauty; his characterization as originally androgynous; these and similar features 36 belong to a stratum of rabbinic thinking that may owe its origin partly to the Urmensch myth which Reitzenstein and Bousset traced to the Iranian Gayomard. There is here certainly a connection with the androgynos motif in Plato's Symposium i89d D.E., i9od.D.B.; 37 and the description of Adam's beauty is foreshadowed in Ezekiel 28:11 ff., where the king of Tyre is portrayed in analogy to Adam in paradise. The mythical colors of this passage clearly indicate that already in pre-rabbinic times the figure of Adam had become richly adorned. Of special interest is the fact that the term "seal" occurs already in Ezekiel 28:12: " Thou seal most accurate (.hItam toknit), full of wisdom and perfect in beauty." 38 The early rabbinic speculations about Adam were taken up and dualistically interpreted by the Hermetist and the Gnostics, who made a sharp division between the archetypal Man and earthly man, the product of his Fall,39 and in turn helped to produce a variety of rabbinic reactions of a polemical nature in some of the haggadic Adam legends which unmistakingly betray their gnostic background.40 The rabbis refused to differentiate between two Adam figures. To them, the Adam endowed with all the attributes of original splendor was identical with earthly man who, in punishment for his sin, was reduced in stature, stripped of his glory, and expelled from paradise. Turning to the Christian understanding of the homo imago Dei motif, let us note first that in Pauline theology it is Jesus who is "the image [eikin] of the invisible God" (Col. I:15) and "in the form of God" (en morphi Theou, Phil. 2:6), "form" representing here, according to the 36 See Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, V (I947), 79 if. 37 See ibid., pp. 88 ff. As for Philo's view, see ibid. and C. H. Dodd, The Bible and the Greeks (London, I935), p. I51. 38 It is improbable that the use of the term "seal of the first Adam" in Mishnah Sanhedrin derives from the Ezekiel verse rather than from Philo. The Tosefta quotes only Job 38:I4- 39 For the influence of the rabbinic Adam speculations on the Hermetist (in the Poimandres) and on some gnostic sects, see Dodd, op. cit., I45-54; and Ginzberg, op. cit., p. 79, respectively. 40 See my article, "The Gnostic Background of the Rabbinic Adam Legends," Jewish Quarterly Review, N.S. 35 (I945), PP- 37I-9I1 244</page><page sequence="11">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology Peshitta, the Hebrew demilt of Genesis 1: 26.41 The designation of Jesus as "the image of God" (II Cor. 4:4) stems from a variety of concepts. It expresses the eschatological notion of the "Son of Man" (bar nasha') or, in Paul's terminology, the "last Adam" (I Cor. 15:45), also referred to as the "coming Adam" (Rom. 5:14); and it is reflected in the Pauline passages contrasting the putting off of the "old man" with the putting on of the "new" (Col. 3:9-I o). This "new" or celestial Man is said to be made in the "image" of God (Col. 3:Io; Eph. 4:24) and bears a certain affinity to Philo's Logos as the direct image of God. As Origen was to put it in precise Philonic terms, "Since the Father is invisible by his nature, He begot an invisible image " (De princ. II, 6, 3; IV, 4, I), while man is but "after the image" or "the image of the image" (De orat. 22, 4).42 Viewed in the Philonic perspective, Paul's concept of Jesus as the image of the Father derives both from an inter- pretation of Genesis I:26 and from the mythical concept of Adam Qadmon, the primordial or celestial Man, which he identified with the bar nasha'. There is a further, and theologically no less important, aspect to the way in which the immage quality ofJesus was understood by Paul. Philo had interpreted the pre-existent Wisdom spoken of in apocalyptic and rabbinic sources as the equivalent of the Logos.43 It is highly doubtful whether he also identified the pre-existent, hidden Messiah mentioned in the same kind of sources with the Logos.44 Neither in Jewish Wisdom literature nor in the apocalyptic and rabbinic writings do we find an equation of the pre-existent Wisdom or Torah with the pre-existent Messiah.45 Theologically speaking, Divine revelation and Divine redemption in the eschaton were kept apart. Paul broke with this tradition. He identified the pre-existent Wisdom or Torah with the pre-existent Messiah.46 Since wisdom, according to Jewish tradition, 41 See Oscar Cullmann, Die Christologie des Neuen Testaments (Tiibingen, 1958), p.

The final step of identifying Christ with the Philonic Logos was taken in the Fourth Gospel. This development meant that in the New Testament the image motif acquired a central theological significance-that it now expressed a definite, clear-cut concept in which were gathered the various strands of interpretation that were present in the Jewish tradition. Jesus was seen as the true image of the Father, as Wisdom or Logos incarnate. This basic doctrine remained the common denominator of the varieties of Christian teaching that soon made their appearance. It underlies the Judaeo-Christian notion of the Pseudo-Clementine Kerygmata Petrou, which identified Jesus with the first Adam and, consequently, refused to acknowledge the veracity of the biblical story of Adam's sin.48 It is found in Valentinian Gnosis, where Jesus is described as the "Logos of the Father" whose "Image" he has revealed, and the one who brought the " Gospel of Truth," the "living Book of the Living which was written in the Thought and in the Mind of the Father and which, even before the foundation of the All, had its abode in that part of Him which is incomprehensible."49 It oscillates in patristic literature between a plainly christological and a trinitarian interpretation.50 And it finds its dogmatic formulation in the Athanasian Creed. The soteriological function which the incarnate Christ or Logos assumes is linked with Adam's sin. It is this aspect of Heilsgeschichte which is responsible for the transformation of the Philonic Logos into the figure of the Redeemer. The Logos as the image of God and as the archetype of man is shifted from the philosophical to the theological level: " The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven... And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly" (I Cor. 15:47, 49). Origen interprets this passage to mean that after the Fall man bears the image of the devil and that Jesus had to come in order to restore the original 47 Cf.

The original image he understands in purely Philonic or Stoic terms as man's soul or Logos or higemonikon. Christ is the restorer of the image.51 Athanasius says similarly that the Word of God, being the image of the Father, had to take on a mortal body in order to destroy death and renew the image of God in men. He sees the whole of Heilsgeschichte centered in the motif of the image, without, however, drawing on the Philonic tradition which played such a vital role in Origen.52 In Gregory of Nyssa, on the other hand, the Platonizing tendency again comes to the fore in its Philonic form, and it is strong enough to repress the view of the Christ image as the restorer of the original image in which man was created. He considered instead the image of man as realizing itself at the end of time in the totality of mankind, the total Christ. Like his predecessors, he admitted, however, that as a result of the Fall the image of God in man had become tarnished and (according to some passages) even lost.53 We need not pursue here the long and checkered history of the Christian debate on the consequences of the Fall. Notwithstanding the difference of opinion between medieval scholastics like Thomas Aquinas on the one hand and reformers like Luther and Calvin on the other, the function of Christ as restorer of the image seems undisputed. This means that in the Christian tradition as a whole the doctrine of original sin is fundamental for an understanding of the role of Christ. In the rabbinic tradition, Adam's sin was widely discussed on both the haggadic and halakic levels, but the debate remained fluid and did not crystallize into a definite doctrine except at a late stage, that is, in medieval Kabbalah. There emerged, however, in rabbinic Judaism the concept of the two "inclinations" in man, namely, the "good inclina- tion" (yeger tob) and the "evil inclination" (yezer rac), both of which were considered part of man's natural endowment as created by God.54 This concept implies that the evil perpetrated by men is the result of a yielding to the evilyezer rather than of original sin,55 that it manifests a person's moral weakness rather than an inherited perversion of the will 51 See ibid., pp. 451-56. 52 See ibid., pp. 456 ff. 5a See ibid., pp. 457-60. 54 See the source references in Solomon Schechter, Aspects of Rabbinic Theology (New York, 1961), pp. 264 ff.; G.

To the intro- spective rabbinic mind, the good and evil in man were in perpetual conflict, the outcome of which was in no way predetermined. This view is already clearly stated in Ecclesiasticus 15 ::I1-20 and represents the rabbinic reaction to the gloomy and pessimistic estimate of human nature found in the apocalyptic writings and in the Christian doctrine of original sin. It has its parallel in the Stoic distinction between the emotions and reason, the emotions being defined as "inordinate and excessive impulse" originating from "lust" (libido) and "delight" (laetitia), "desire" (concupiscentia) and "pleasure" (voluptas). Philo had no difficulty in equating the rabbinic concept of the good and evil yezer with this Stoic description of the dual nature of man.56 Similarly, the medieval Jewish Neoplatonist Bahya ibn Paqudah (ca. Io8o) speaks of " concupiscence" (Arabic: shahwa; Hebrew: ta'awah) and "reason" (Caql; sekel) as the two conflicting "qualities" (achldq; midd6t) of the soul. He explains that the force of reason needs strengthening by the authority of the revealed Law or Torah because it develops late and tends to be enfeebled as a result of the fact that the force of concupiscence is prevalent in the soul of man from his birth and is vital to his physical growth and to the perpetuation of the species.57 This notion Bahya might have taken from Arabic gnomic literature, which says in the name of Plato that concupiscence is closer to us because we are in its company from the time of birth, while intellect develops much later.58 It is already found, however, in rabbinic sources (Kohelet Rabba 9:15; Abot de-Rabbi Nathan, ed. Solomon Schechter, Recension A, chap. xvii), where it is said that the evilyezer is with man from birth, whereas the good yezer enters only at the age of thirteen.59 There is, then, a close affinity between the rabbinic doctrine of the two yezarim and the Stoic view expressed by Philo and Bahya. The theological significance of this type of anthropology lies in the role assigned to Torah for the strengthening of the good yezer and for the overpowering of the evil one. In the words of Ritba: " Though God created the evil yezer, He created the Torah as an antidote against it" (Baba Batra I6a). The fulfilment of the Divine commandments (mizwot) and, especially, the study of the Torah are considered the most 56 See Wolfson, Philo, II, 230 ff.; 288-90. 57 Al-Hidaya Oild Fard'id al-Qulfb, ed.

If he is a stone, he will be ground [into powder]; if he is iron, he will be broken into pieces; as it is said, 'Is not my word like unto a fire? saith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the rocks in pieces?"'" (Jer. 23: 29; Qiddushin 3ob). "Blessed are Israel; as long as they are devoted to the study of the Torah and to works of loving-kind- ness, the evil yezer is delivered into their hands" (cAbodah Zarah 5b). These utterances express no abstract theologoumenon but something of an existential nature. The rabbis were keenly aware of the reality of the evil yezer as concupiscence and the power of its temptation. They saw its demonic side and identified it with Satan. Many stories told in rabbinic literature testify to this.60 Yet they experienced also the cathartic effect of the life of piety in obedience to the Divine command- ments and in the study of Torah. Speaking in haggadic terms, they said that the poison injected into Eve by the serpent was removed from Israel when the Torah was received at Sinai.61 If this statement implies a " crude theory of original sin," 62 it also includes the doctrine that the Torah is the remedy of the Fall. In other words, the place occupied by Jesus Christ in Christian theology is taken up by the Torah in Jewish theological thinking. The Torah is the Way, the Light, the Truth, as had already been stated in the Hebrew Bible, especially in Psalm I19. It is the healer of the breach, and through it man causes the Divine Presence (Shekinah) to dwell on earth, nay, on man's face.63 It teaches man how to practice imitatio Dei: "As He is merciful and gracious, so be thou merciful and gracious" (Mekilta 37a; Shabbat 133b and parallels).64 What the Torah and its commandments as illumined by rabbinic Halakah and Haggadah mean to the Jew brought up in the Tradition and staying within its bounds is something difficult to explain to the outsider. One prepared to attune his ear may catch a good glimpse of it in some of Agnon's novels, particularly in his Oreakh Natah La-Lian ("A Guest for the Night").65 It describes his return, after World War I, to 60 See the collection of such stories in Montefiore and Loewe, op. cit.

It evokes memories of a glorious past with its flowering of true piety and rabbinic learning. The "key" to this Bet Ha-Midrash becomes his property, and the narrative woven around this theme contains reflec- tions and even homilies of a poignant and often mystically iridescent beauty in which the innermost secret of Jewish piety stands revealed. There has been a continuous tradition of almost two thousand years in which the Jewish love of Torah found its expression in conformity with the spirit nurtured in the schools of the tanaitic teachers and their successors in both Palestine and Babylonia. It is, therefore, unrealistic to suggest that the Jews living at the time of Jesus, who felt a sense of allegiance to the Torah, might have allowed the Christian kerygma or didachJ to replace the Torah in its fullness, or might have renounced faith in the love of God as manifested in the giving of the Torah in favor of faith in the love of God as revealed in Jesus. The time was certainly not propitious for such a transfer of loyalty: The academies were in the ascendent; rabbinic exegesis flourished; the Torah was considered the way of life by Pharisees and Essenes alike. The abrogation of the com- mandments as proclaimed by Paul did not fit into the pattern of Heilsgeschichte as understood by the Jews. Adam had received only one single commandment, Noah and his posterity were given seven laws, and Israel had taken upon itself the Ten Commandments as well as the "yoke of the Kingdom of God" as spelled out in the 613 command- ments.66 Biblical Heilsgeschichte thus showed an increase in the revealed commandments, not a reduction to a single one. In the words of Rabbi Hananya ben CAqashya (middle of the second century c.E.): "The Holy One, blessed be He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments" (Mishnah Makkot 3:16). Thinking in halakic categories, the rabbis pointed out that Adam showed himself incapable of keeping a "light command- ment" (mizwah qalah), while his descendants proved themselves infinitely more obedient in observing much more difficult command- ments.67 In view of the preponderance of the halakic viewpoint in rabbinic Judaism, there was hardly any scope for the assertion of original sin as a live option. God's covenant with Noah (which, by the 66 The figure 6I 3 was originally of no halakic import but merely symbolized the totality of the commandments (see Michael Guttmann, Behinat Ha-Mizwot, Bericht des jikdisch-theologischen Seminars [Breslau, I928]). 67 Genesis Rabba 2 1:3; 2 1:7; Leviticus Rabba 25:2. 250</page><page sequence="17">Homo Imago Dei in Jewish and Christian Theology way, reaffirms, according to Gen. 9:6, the creation of man in God's image and thereby renders the notion of the "corrupted" image irreconcilable with the biblical text) was the first step toward a greater abundance of grace through an increase in commandments. The giving of the Torah to Israel further enlarged the area in which merit could be acquired. In this context, salvation through faith in Christ made no sense whatsoever. On the haggadic plane we do meet with descriptions of the fatal consequences of Adam's sin which border upon the doctrine of the Fall. Reference has already been made to the legend concerning the poison injected by the serpent into Eve and to the way the rabbis countered it. Then there are a number of sources 68 which speak of twenty-two or twenty-four "blessings" which God had bestowed on Adam and of which man was gradually deprived after the fall of Adam and the sins of the following generations, but which mankind will receive again in the days of the Messiah. Thus, Adam lost the image of God (that is, his God-like splendor), tall stature, paradise, and the tree of life; the generation of the Flood lost its gigantic strength, its longevity, the multitude of children, and peace; and so on. Yet all this is purely haggadic and remains in the realm of legend. The only theologically relevant remark is Rabbi Levi's (Genesis Rabba 14:6), which applies the appellation "the greatest man among the giants" (ha-'adam ha-gadol ba-canaqim) (Josh. 14:I 5) to Abraham: He was called "the greatest man" because he was worthy of being created first, prior to Adam, but God said, "Perhaps Adam will spoil things (yeqalqel), and there will be no one to put things right again [we-'en mZ she-yetaqen]." Hence Adam was created first, and when he sinned, Abraham came to make amends. Here Abraham assumes the role which Christian theology assigned to Jesus. In medieval Jewish theology, this theme was developed by Hasday Crescas in his Or Adonai (" The Light of the Lord "), which was completed in Saragossa in the year 141o.69 In an earlier small treatise written in Spanish and preserved only in Joseph ben Shemtob's Hebrew translation under the title Bit.tul clqqarj Ha-Nozerim,70 there is no men- tion yet of this particular doctrine, although much scope is given to a rebuttal of the Christian dogma of original sin and of mankind's redemption through Jesus.

In his view, each individual soul is created by God and hence does not bear any transmitted guilt due to Adam's sin. Nor, in his opinion, does the soul's eternal felicity depend on supernatural grace, seeing that the contemplative life directed toward God naturally leads to life eternal. God could not deprive man of this felicity without committing an act of injustice. As for the Christian doctrine of redemption through the blood of Christ, Crescas points out, human acts of sin can be remedied only by human acts of redress, and even if it were possible for God to assume human. flesh, the kind of redemption described in the Gospels is impossible for the following reason: Healing of sins can be effected only by good deeds (migwot), since they are the opposite of sins, even as rebellion can be remedied only by obedience. The healing of a vile act by one still viler is like the healing of rebellion by rebellion or of iniquity by iniquity. Now, to assume that Adam's rebellion, which was of a minor nature, involving as it did only one single light commandment, was to be healed by the rebellion of God's chosen people against God himself (through the alleged committing of deicide) is an absurdity. If it were true, the salvation of mankind would have been purchased by allowing the nation of God's elect to become an abomination and to be besmirched by the greatest imaginable indignity. Would not the blood shed by Jesus' circumcision have been a sufficient means of redemption if he was God incarnate ? 71 In his Or Adonai (II, 2, 6, fol. 28a-b), Crescas no longer opposes the notion of original sin. He quotes the haggadic statement about the poison injected into Eve and explains it to mean that "apparently the sin of Adam and Eve was a great rebellion in the sense of original sin [lit., 'in its first root' (ba-shoresh ha-ri'shon)].72 Into the rock from which 71 A closely similar argument, to which Professor Gottfried W. Locher of Bern University has drawn my attention, is found in Calvin's small tract, Ad Quaestiones et Obiecta Iudaei cuiusdam (Calvini Opera, Corpus Reformatorum, IX, 659-74). Question I by the Jew reads as follows: Quomodo vos dicitis lesum venisse, ut mundare homines a peccatis, et ut educeret eos a gehenna, quum ille dum occisus est, auxerit peccatum Iudaeorum, qui cruci afxerunt eum? Nam non potest inveniri maius peccatum, quam suspensio Dei. The identity of the Iudaeus whom Calvin sought to refute has still to be established. Salo W. Baron, "John Calvin and the Jews," Harry Austryn Wolfson Jubilee Volume, English Section (Jerusalem, 1965), I, I55-59, tentatively suggested Josel of Rosheim as Calvin's interlocutor. See now Gottfried W. Locher, "Calvin spricht zu den Juden," Theo- logische Zeitschrift (Basel, 1967), XXIII, 180-89. 72 Cf. with this phrase its equivalent in Bi.t.tul clqqare Ha-Nozerim, p.

For this reason the species as a whole was disposed toward corruption and destruction." Crescas then refers to the "supernal grace " which provided the Torah as an antidote to that poison, since its commandments admonish us in sufficient measure to turn toward perfection, to subdue concupiscence, and to transform our yezer. He is, however, not satisfied merely to spell out the haggadic reference to Sinai. He needs the figure of a redeemer as the analogue to the Christian savior, and he finds it in Abraham, the "very opposite" of Adam. For while Adam, the handiwork of God Himself and destined for perfection, went to the extreme of rebellion, Abraham, who was born among idol worshipers, went to the extreme of love and became the most perfect man. "Hence he was worthy of being brought into a 'new covenant' (berit hadashah) with God." This covenant took the form of the sacrificial blood and flesh of circumcision by which the eternity of the human species is assured. For it puts a sign on the very organ of concupiscence restraining its lust and is thus endowed with saving power. Crescas finds this idea expressed in the blessing spoken at the ceremony of circumci- sion: "On this account, O living God, our Portion and our Rock, give command to deliver from destruction the dearly beloved of our flesh, for the sake of the covenant thou hast set in our bodies." Moreover, Crescas sees in Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, the son of the promise, the raison d'etre of the election of Israel. Mount Moriah, the scene of the intended sacrifice or caqedah, is thus, by implication, set off against Golgotha.73 Although the dramatis personae are different, Crescas' theological thinking would seem to exhibit a decidedly Christian pattern of Heilsgeschichte. On the other hand, his admission of original sin was facilitated by the impact of kabbalistic notions concerning the catastrophic results of Adam's sin and the salvational function of the Torah. Fundamentally, these kabbalistic views are elaborations of haggadic motifs which, in turn, reflect in many instances mythological material, especially of the gnostic kind. het" Adam ha-shorashi ha-niqra? bi-leshonam "original" (" Concerning the redemption of the root-sin of Adam called in their language 'original'"). 73 The comparison of the two sacrifices is a theme which Franz Rosenzweig and Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy discussed in their letters on Judaism and Christianity (see Franz Rosenzweig/Briefe [Berlin, 1935], pp. 663, 689).

Emmet is being published by Alabama University Press. 253</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion Medieval Jewish theology followed, on the whole, the Platonizing interpretation of the homo imago Dei motif initiated by Philo. Whereas the rabbis of the tannaitic period had discarded the Philonic Logos, the medieval Jewish philosophers substituted for it .either Plotinus' second hypostasis, the Intellect (Nous), or Aristotle's Active Intellect as the last of the series of Intelligences related to the celestial spheres and their souls. Man's pre-eminence over the lower ranges of creation lay in his rational soul or potential intellect, and his ultimate destiny was the felicity achieved through the contemplative life of reason and con- summated in the union of his intellect with either God (as in Neo- platonism) or with the Active Intellect (as in medieval Aristotelianism). Since God is (in Neoplatonism) the ultimate Ground from which Intellect emanates, and since he is (in Aristotelianism) the supreme Intellect, the essence of man, namely, his intellect, has been stated by Scripture to be in the image of God and in his likeness. This is how Maimonides explains the biblical phrase, and this interpretation became commonplace in Jewish philosophy and exegesis.74 Maimonides adds an interpretation of the nature of Adam's sin: In his state of innocence Adam was completely absorbed in the contemplative life and hence unaware of the difference between good and evil. For intellect is only concerned with the true as against the false. When, however, he dis- obeyed the commandment and yielded to concupiscence, he became conscious of good and evil.75 This interpretation is strikingly similar to the one given by Athanasius (Contra Gentes 2, 3): "As long as the first man kept his spirit attached to God and to the contemplation of God, it was turned away from the contemplation of the body; but when ... it betook itself to considering itself, they [Adam and Eve] were seized by the desires of the body, and they knew that they were naked." 76 The difference between Jewish and Christian exegesis in the area of the homo imago Dei motif concerned not so much the philosophical concept of man's dignity as a rational creature-this remained, in fact, common ground throughout medieval Christian scholasticism-as the theological equation of Logos and Christ. Thus, a topos prevalent in practically all Christian exegesis is the interpretation of the plural form in Genesis I :26 (" Let us make man ...") as referring to either the first two or all three 74 Maimonides, Guide to the Perplexed, I, I. The extent to which Maimonides' interpretation of the phrase was accepted may be gauged by the fact that the Yemenite compiler of the Midrash Ha-Gadol adopted it into his text. See Mordecai Margaliot's edition (Jerusalem, 1947), p. 56, and the note to line 14. 75 Maimonides, op. cit., I, 2. 76 Quoted by Camelot, op. cit.

Since in the medieval understanding "angels" was the biblical term for the hierarchy of supernal intelligences con- nected with the celestial spheres, it was not difficult to find in the text an allusion to the creation of man in the image of the angels and to inter- pret the plural form, "Let us make. . . ," accordingly. This line of exegesis was adopted by Abraham ibn Ezra,79 Abraham Maimonides,so and, in a less philosophical vein, already by Rashi.81 Isaac Abrabanel states it as the second of two main types of interpretation.82 Other exegetes (David Qimhi, Nahmanides, Gersonides, and Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi) 83 stressed man's dual nature, composed as it is of an earthy (material) and a spiritual (intellectual) part. God, therefore, addressed the earth, bidding her contribute her share in man's creation. Abrabanel, who states this interpretation as the first on his list, couples it with the notion of man's dominion over the lower forms of creation, which, he says, is valid and effective only as long as man keeps his own lower instincts under the control of reason.84 Finally, Saadya Gaon explained that the tertium comparationis justifying the description of man as made in the image of God consists in his role as lord of the earth as stated in Genesis I : 28-3o.85 This exegesis is supported by the equivocal meaning of the Hebrew word Elohim, which may also mean "rulers" or "judges."86 In view of these manifold possibilities of interpretation, Jewish theologians were not unduly worried by the christological 77 See M.

In his Eben Bohan ("A Tried Stone," see Isa. 28: I6), a voluminous tract in defense of Judaism against Christian arguments from Scripture,87 Shemtob ben Isaac ibn Shaprut of Toledo quotes "the believer in the Trinity" (ha-meshallesh) as saying: "It is written, 'Let us make man,' which indicates that the Father speaks to his Son; and he says, 'in our image, after our likeness,' which is likewise in the plural." The answer given by "the believer in the Unity" contains several of the interpreta- tions mentioned above. It cannot be said that the exegetical debate between Christians and Jews produced more than a firm entrenchment of each group in its respective position. Thus, after reviewing the rabbinic interpretations of the plural form in Genesis I: 26, Calvin concludes: "Christians, therefore, properly contend, from this testimony, that there exists a plurality of Persons in the Godhead."88 However, the controversy reached a new dimension-without being spelled out in direct polemical references-when on the Christian side the Reformation brought about a more radical conception of man's corruption through the Fall, and on the Jewish side Lurianic Kabbalah accentuated the same stance in a highly mythological gnostic form. The theological difference centered now in the appraisal of the salvational means, rather than in the diagnosis of man's spiritual ills. Yet common to both the Reformation and the new Kabbalah was the collapse of the Platonic ontology that had underpinned the homo imago Dei concept. According to the Re- formers, man could no longer be considered to share in the Divine Reason, and the whole notion of natural law went overboard. Nor was God primarily Reason, but Will, Power. Man's nature was, conse- quently, seen as incapable of spirituality by virtue of reason alone. Hence Luther's rejection of the spiritual efficacy of natural institutions and of works of the Law, including the sacramental system of the medieval church. Hence also his emphasis on faith as the only means of salvation, and his description of faith as worked within man by God's arbitrary grace. Similarly, Calvin insisted on the voluntaristic rather than ra- tional interpretation of the nature of God. Knowing God was, therefore, not so much a function of reason as of the will, and what had been corrupted by the Fall was the will of man to subject itself to the will of 87 The work, as yet unpublished, is extant in a large number of MSS.

Only through a total transformation of man by faith and obedience to the will of God as expressed in the Scriptures could he regain the lost status of imago Dei. Even in the prelapsarian condition, this status had not implied an absolute and substantive nature of man but merely the potentiality of acknowledging God in "rectitude" of spirit. Calvin expressly rejected the traditional Platonic interpretation of man as an image or copy of God.89 The natural consequence of the voluntaristic concept of God advanced by Luther and Calvin lies in their respective political theories. Both theologians reaffirmed the Augustinian view of the state as an artificial creation sanctioned by God, since without it "men would devour one another.., .and the world would be reduced to chaos." 90 The authority of the state was held by divine right because it alone mitigated the anarchic effects of sin upon fallen man. The difference between Luther's and Calvin's doctrines as applied to the relationship between church and state need not concern us here. Hobbes's political theory in the Leviathan would seem to be in the nature of a secularized version of the portrayal of man in his fallen state adumbrated from the theological perspective by Luther and Calvin. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the dominant influence in Jewish mystical theology from the sixteenth century down to the emergence of Hasidism, the breakdown of the Platonic interpretation of the homo imago Dei concept is no less conspicuous, though expressed in an entirely different way and totally unrelated to problems of political philosophy. Here theology takes the path of a radically introspective orientation spelled out in the most bizarre forms of gnostic speculation. In the classical Kabbalah of the thirteenth century, notably in the Zohar, the neo- platonic outlook had been very much in evidence. Not only was the "intelligent soul" considered to be an image of God; the human body, too, was held to be in the similitude of Adam Qadmon, the supernal structure (binyan) of the Sefirot.91 In Lurianic Kabbalah, on the other 89 Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, trans.

Here Adam appears on the scene after the catastro- phic event of the scattering of the Divine light and the necessity of its restoration (tiqqan) had already arisen. Man was created in order to complete the process of tiqqlln, and the theogonic drama of the union and reintegration of the forces of light was about to be completed when Adam's sin threw everything back into confusion. Now it is the task of man to re-enact the process of tiqqan through long and protracted effort until the end of days. The advent of the Messiah means nothing but the completion of tiqqan by way of fulfilling the commandments of the Torah and mystical meditation (kawwanah) in prayer.93 As to the effects of Adam's sin upon himself and mankind as a whole, Luria has a full- fledged and elaborate doctrine of original sin.94 In the spiritual climate of nineteenth-century Enlightenment, Moses Mendelssohn discarded the kabbalistic tradition, and, taking his cue from the Natural Law School which had begun to influence even Protestant ecclesiastical law, he boldly proclaimed his belief in the essential goodness of man even in the state of nature. In brushing aside Hobbes's theory, he implicitly rejected the theological doctrine of original sin,95 and he said so clearly in his Gegenbetrachtungen iiber Bonnets Palingenesie, which he wrote toward the end of the year 1769 (but never published), when he had been challenged by Johann Caspar Lavater either to refute or to accept Christianity: "As for man, we believe that he was created after the image of God, yet that he was destined to remain a man, that is, liable to sin. We know nothing of original sin. Adam and Eve sinned because they were human beings, and they died because they sinned, and the same happens to all their posterity. They sin and die."'96 This negation of original sin has 92 This is precluded by the very fact that now a variety of Divine configurations, or par.;ufim, is assumed. The concept of the four worlds (see G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism [rev. ed.], p. 272) cuts across the doctrine of the parzufim. The question as to which of the four worlds is man's place of origin is variously answered in Lurianic Kabbalah (see J. Tishby, Torat ha-Rac we-ha-Qelipah be-Qabbalat Ha-:Ari [Tel-Aviv, 1942], p. 104 if.). 93 See ibid., pp. 91 ff.; Scholem, op. cit.

Has it any function other than to express the notion of the dignity of man ? Hermann Cohen still tried to retain its time-honored Platonic flavor, but he could do so only because he interpreted the Platonic "idea" in his own fashion as Grundlegung (hypothesis). Hence "man in the image or idea of God" meant to him the logically understood correlation between man's reason and its "origin" or ground in God.97 Yet Platonism as commonly understood has been proclaimed dead. According to Martin Heidegger's inter- pretation, Nietzsche's obituary notice of Divinity meant to say that Platos' supersensible world was dead.98 If the notion of God had indeed come to be tied to Platonism, and assuming that Platonism was dead, how do we understand the homo imago Dei concept? Shall we, with Luther and Calvin, see in it the affirmation of a bond to be achieved by faith alone, or shall we, with Luria and his disciples, stress the role man has to play in redeeming the world-nay, God Himself-from the forces of evil? Merely to speak of the "dignity of man" without anchoring it in some kind of theology would seem rather futile. Is there a way in which we can again speak of man as created in God's image without sounding hollow and trivial? Do we still believe in man because we believe in God? The question, it appears, concerns Jews and Christians alike. 97 Cf. my article, "Hermann Cohens Begriff der Korrelation," In Zwei Welten, Sieg fried Moses zum 75. Geburtstag (Tel-Aviv, 1962), pp. 377-99.
