[1.] The Batiniyeh, on account of their profession of the in- ward sense of the Book, beside its outward sense. For they say, that the Kuran has an outward and an itlward sense; and as for its meaning, that its outward sense appertains to the sciences of langllage, and that the relation of the inward sense to the outward is like the relation of the pith to the bark. And they say that the laying hold of its outward sense punishes with fatigue in assiduous action, and tllat its in- ward sense is an aid to the leaving ofl of action by its outward sense. And as respects this, they lay hold of his saying let him be exalted ! " And so there is established between them a wall, having a gate the inward part of which, within it, is mercy, and the outward part, before it, is punishment."t [2.] The Karamateh, because their leader, he who levelled the high-way for their doctrine, was a man named Hamdan of Karmat,: which is the only place of its name, namely, War- mat. of Wasit. [3.] The Haramiyeh,@ on account of their desecration of sacred things, and allowing of things forbid- den. [4.] The Sab'iyeh, 1t because they think that the :Natiks of the revealed laws, that is, the Envoys, are seven, * Meaning that it obliges to go throu(^h laborious outward observances. t See Kuran, Sur. lvii. v. 13. The " wall" spoken of in this passage, is prop- erly a wall separating " believers" fronz " hypocrites" in a future state. :t This person, commonly called Karmat, was the leader of a faction among the Isma'ilis, which separated itself A.

"And when we received from the Prophets their enagements," and then receive, with receiv- lng, his engagement, made in accordance with a firm belief, on his part, that no secret thing is hidden from them; and second, the obligating him, in behalf of the Imam, with re- spect to the clearing up of that which he is confused about, c)f the things which one presents to him; because it is he who knows them, and the calldidate has no command of them until he elevates himself to something of the degree which pertains to him, and comes to the Imam; and then [5.] the iinposition, which is the pretension of agreement with them on the part of the great in religious and worldly aSairs,t so that the candidate may be more in favor of that to which one calls him; and then [6.] tEle putting upon a fOUndatiOn, WhiCh iS the arranging of premises to which he who is called is favorable, and which he grants, which point him to that false doctrine to which one calls him; and then [7.] the divestiture, which is the causing to rest in the neglect of corporeal actions; and then [8.] the despoiling of the firm beliefs of religion. And when an aSair of calling has gone so Mar, they set about to abrogate prohibitions, and to incite to indulgence in pleasures, and to allegorize the laws, agreeably to their saying that the partial washing signifies friendship to the Imam; and as for the entire washing, that it is the receiv- ing by hearsay from the Madhun, when the Imam is hidden, what prayer is; and that prayer signifies the Natik, who is the Envoy, as is proved by his saying,-let him be exalted!

And their doctrine is, that God is not existentl nor non- existent; neither knowing, nor ignorant; neither powerful, nor weak; and so on, as to all the attributes; and that be- cause veritable aflirmation requires the association of him with things existent, which is a3a anthropomorphism; while absolute dellial requires the association of him with things non-existeng which is a making void.

Says El-midy, Such were the opirlions of some sense- less person; and when El-Hasan Ibn Muhammed Es-Sabbah appeared, he exerted himself, and the call assumed that he was the Hujjeh, who relieves the Imam, whom no period may be without. Alld the sum of his system was that which took the precedence, respecting the need of the teacher. Moreover, he prollibited common people from meddling with the sciences, and people of note from looking into the ancient Boolcs, lest their disgraces should be exposed. And afterwards thev became Philosophers, and ceased not to make sport of the cano-ns of religious ordinances and legal commands; and they entrenched themselves ill fortresses, and their power increased, and any kings whose vezirs were of their party, feared calamity, for they made a show of neglecting duties, and openly desecrated sacred things, and became like brute beasts, without any religious control, or legal restraint.

The appellation of the Tatarkhamyeh which he here gives them, without any explanation, is deserving of attention. It must certainly be inferred from it, that the follow- ers of Karmat had, in process of time, become so associated with some people among the Northern hordes, which in the thirteenth century of our era were pressing in upon the old empire of the Khallfehs, that a naine significant of such an association wollld be generally laderstood as applicable to them.</page><page sequence="8">asked,-respecting a man who makes a show of Islam, and prays, and fasts, and makes a show of the profession of unity, and belief ill Muhammed, let peace be to him ! for mally years, and afterwards confesses, saying, " As for me, I have been, during these past years, a firm believer accord ing to the doctrine of the Karamateh, and I have been a Da'i to men; and now I am a convert, and return to Islam," and makes now a show of that which he before made a show of, pertaining to the religion of Islam, only that he is suspected to hold the doctrine of the Karamateh, as if he were among them, what the sentence is as to his blood, and his property, and his efSects, while the occasion of his exposing hilBself, and his confession, is that he has been -found out, and it were idle, until he confesses his doctrine, to put him to death. 'Abd-El-l:arim Ibn Muhammed said, "The putting to death of thc Karamateh, universally, is a necessary thing, and their being treated without discrimination, a statute, be- cause they are veritably apostate unbelievers, and their in- fluence to corrupt the religion of Islam is greater than any other, and the injury whicll they do, the greatest of injuries." Abu-l-Hasan Muhalxmed Sa'id said, " It may be said of this man of whom mention is made, as Abu Hanifeh,-let God be merciful to hila ! is related to have said respecting a Kadary who said, in the presence of Abu Hanifeh, ' I am a convert ;' Abu Hanifeh, namely, let God be merciful to him ! said, ' Conversion on thy part is that thou returnest to all whom thou hast led astray, and callest them to the truth, and sayest, " As for me, I have been holding false And Abu-l-Wasim 'Abd-El-Rahman Ibn El-Husein Es- ,aSar said, " With regard to the like of these, namely, the Karamateh, whenesrer we cause them to be found out, the obligation rests upon the Sultan, in the first instance, and upon the doctors of the law of the Muslims, in the second instance, to set it down to their account to put them to death, and to eradicate them, not adinitting, on their part, either conversion, or apology." And Abu Muhammed 'Abd-El-Karim Ibn Muhammed said, "As for all who act openly, of the Karamateh,- let * See note 1t p- 276. 286</page><page sequence="9">God abandon them! as firm believers according to their doctrine, and become Da'is of men to it, they are not, after that, sincere in their pretension of conversion, and return to Islam; because they are not truly converted, and make a show, on their part, of that which they make a show of, only after the manner of piety, for the satety of themselves, and their property, and their families, and their children, or something thereof; for a certain one said, 'Methinks that to pray, which profits not, is advantageous among Imams,7 and he was one of the Party of the Impious; to wllich his pupil said, ' O my preceptor, what avails this assiduity, while we acknowledge the faith ?' whereupon he said, ' It is on account of the custom of the country, and for the protection of family and children.' So then, if we were to admit, on their part, that which they pretend of conversion, they would make that turn out to the overthrow of Islam and the laws; and the injury to the Muslims would be greater than that which happens to them of irljury from those with whom they are at war. And accordinfflly, one of our men tells us that the doctors of the law in Balkh have decided in favor of shedding the blood of the Karamateh, and burn- ing up their houses, after they have declared themselves of their opinion; and so some of them were beaten with thongs, and aIterwards put to death." And Abu Selimeh Muhammed Ibn Dawud Esh-Shafi'y, said, " Whoever bruits this vile doetrine, and malces a show, on his part, of the call to it, let not any conversion be ad- mitted oll his part, but on the contrary let him be put to death. And Abu Se'id El-Istakhry, one of our men, was of this opinion, and said, ' Some of our men have distin- guished that which marks the apostate in the follower of Karmat, with respect to conversion. And if the follower of Warmat is an apostate, he lets go the manifest senses of words7 and calls up their hidden senses; and so, when he with his tongue rnakes a show of conversion on his part, it may be that, together with that, he declares something hidden, which he pretends, as his tongue happens to express itJ after the manner of piety; and he gives out that he is already con- verted, so that his being a Muslim may not be judged of. * Meaning the principles involving the abrogation of all outward ob- servances. 287</page><page sequence="10">288 And as for the apostate other than the follower of lEarmat, beeause he ealls not up the hidden senses of words, as the follower of Karmat does, and he was a Muslim originally, whenever he professes Islam, he returns, al:ld we know thathe is eonverted. Verilyhe, let himbe exalted! says, "So then, what shall be the portion of those who fight against God and his Envoy, and exert themselves to eor- rupt the earth? ete.,"-whieh is direeted against those who exert themselves to eorrupt the earth; but religion is wor- thier alld prior, beeause that whieh religion enjoins is of more moment, to be eared for, than the earth, in every respeet, and prior to it." ' The above is in brief what was said. And an inquiry was proposed to the Sheikh el-Islam, the Seal of profound investigators, of the party of Hanbal, TalQky ed-din Ibn lLatmiyeh, the form of whieh was as fol- lows :t " AYhat say tlle learned seignors, the Imains of re- ligion,- -let God be graeious to them all, and aid them to manifest the plain truth, and to eover the fair show of er- rorists ! respeeting the Nusairiyeh, who deelare the lawful° ness of wine, alld the transmigration of spirits, and the eternity of the world; and profess to dellJJ the awakening,: and the gathering, and the resurrection, and the Garden and the Fire, in allother tllan the life which is of this world; and declare that the five prayers sigllify five names, whieh are 'Aly, and El-Hasan, and El-Husein, and Aluhsin, and Fati- meh, so that the melltioning of these five suffices them, in place of the ablution of the wllole body, on account of sexual intercourse, and tlle partial washing, and the other eondi- tions of prayer, and its essentials; and that fasting, in their opinion, signifies three men, and is the name of three women, all of whom they enumerate in their books, to mention whom partieularlythere is no roonl here; and that their Deity, who ereated tlle heavens and earth, is 'Aly Ibn Abu Talib,-let God be graeious to him! so that he, in their * Kuran, Sur. v. v. 37.

And the Isin? in their opinion, among the first of men, was Adam, and the Ma'na, Shait ;t and the Ism, Ya'kub, and the Ma'na, Yusuf; and they use to prove this representation, as they think, that which is in the Kuran, namely, a story about Ya'kub and Yusuf, let peace be to them both ! and accordingly say, " What was Ya'kub ? as for him, he was the Ism, for what power exceeds its station ?:; and he says, ' Presently, I will ask pardon for you of my Lord; verily, he is the Pardoner, the Compassionate ;'§ and as for Yusuf, he was the Ma'na who is asked, and so he says, ' There is no reprimanding of you this day, God pardons you,' 11 and brings not in the authority of another, because he knows that he is the absolute Deity." And they lay it down that Musa was the Ism, and Yushu'a, the Ma'na, and say, "As for Yushu'a, the sun yielded to him, after he had com- manded it, and obeyet his command; and does the sun yield to any one except its Lord?" And they lay it down that Suleiman was the Ism, and Asaf, $he Ma'na, and say, " Suleiman was impotent to cause to be present the throne of Belkis, and Xsaf had power to do it, because Suleiman * The Nusairis are here represented as holding that the Deity in name, the Ism, and the Deity in reality, the Ma'na, appear in every age. + Seth. : : lts original. § See KurAnS Sur. sii. v. 89.

So much for this. But it is a part of the substance of religion, and of the address, in their opinion, that instruction be given that 'Aly is the Ijord; and Muhammed, the Veil; and Selman, the Gate; and that these, in this order, have not ceased, and will not cease to be. And to the rhyming which is famous among them, of some of their extravagances, belongs the saying of one, the accursed, the disbeliever in God,-let him be exalted! "I testify that there is no Deity, except the Ijion with bald temples and big belly;t and no Veil to him, except Muhammed the Just, the Faithful; and no Way to him, except Selman the Possessor of power, the Stedfast." And in like manner, there are the five Solitaries,4: and the twelve Nakibs,§ whose names are rnade known, according to thelal, in their detestable books; for they cease not to pro- claim the Lord, the Veil, and the Gate, in every revolution and period, forever, without end. Also, that the Iblis of Iblises was 'Omar Ibn El-Khattab, let God be gracious to him ! and that the next in the rank of Ibllses was Abu Bekr and then 'Othman, let God be gracious to them, and clear thern, andSelevate their rank above the sayings of the Her- etics, and the profession of the self-devoting Extravagants ! and they cease not, at any time, to exist, according to what they tell. And tllere are ramifications and subdivisions to their doc- trines, which come back to these fundamental principles melltioned. * See Kuran, Sur. xxvii. vv. 38-40.

And what is the recompense of him who labors assiduously for that, and is zealous for it, and intent upon it ? Have they spoken explicitly respecting these things, as assisted, and aided, and recompensed, if God,- let him be exalted ! wills ?" The answer respecting this, in the hand-writing of the Sheikh Takky ed-din Ibn Yatmiyeh, may God,- let him be exalted ! be merciful to him ! -was as follows: " As for these people, denominated the Nusairlyeh, they and tlie other classes of the mystical Karamateh,+ a-re rnore unbe- lieving than the Jews and the Christians; nay, more unbe- lieving than nlany idolaters; and the injury which they do to the comnlunity of Muhammed, let the divine benedic- tion and peace be to him! is greater than the injury done by warring infidels, such as the infidels of the Turks and Franks, and others. For these luleet the warring of the Muslims by affecting to be Shi'ah, vThile, in reality, they believe not in God, nor in his Envoy, nor in his Book, nor in any command, nor in any prohibition, nor in any reward, nor in any peilalty, nor in any Garden, nor in any Fire, nor in any one of the Messengers preceding our Prophet Muhammed,- let the divine benediction and peace be to him! llor in any of the fortner religions; nay, they take up the word of God and his Envoy, acknowledged among X The Mediterranean. t It seems to have been understood, when Ibn Yatmiyeh gave the follonr- ing opinion, that the Nusairis were a class of the Karmatis. 292</page><page sequence="15">293 the Muslims, to allegorize it agreeablv to certain things which they are full of, pretending that they constitute the science of the hidden sense, such as those mentioned by the inquirer, and others not of this sort. For, as for them, they have no set limit as to that which they pretend of heresy respecting the names of the Creator, and his signs,* and of perversion of the word of God, let him be exalted ! and the word of his Envoy, to the doing away of its positions, inasmuch as their intention is to deny the faith and the laws of Islam, altogether; while at the same time they hold &lt;3ut that these things have their realities, known to them, which are such sort of things as the inquirer has mentioned, and such as their saying that the five prayers are the knowledge of their secrets; and tlle prescribed fasting, the concealment of their secrets; and the pilgrimage to the Ancient House,+ the visiting of their sheikhs; and that the two hands of Abu Lahab: were Abu Bekr and 'Omar, - let God be gracious to them both! and that the GEreat Prophet, and the Evident Imam, was 'Aly Ibn Abu Talib,r let God be gracious to him ! And they are the authors of some well-known charges, and some books composed, in hostility to Islam and its people. And so, whenever it is in their power, they shed the blood of the Muslims, as they put to death, once upon a time, the pilgrims to Mekkeh, and cast them into Zem- zem, and, once upon a time, took off the Black Stone, which remained with them a long while, and put to death a multitude which only God, let him be exalted! can compute, of the learned men of tlle Muslims, and their elders, and their princes, and their troops.§ And it is said that they have cornposed many books, and that what the inquirer mentions is in them, and other things.

And as for that which the inquirer has mentioned by way of describing them, it is a little out of the much of that which is known to learned men, as descriptive of them. And it is, among other things, known among them, that the Christians possessed themselves of the sea-coasts of Syria only by means of them, who are always in league with every enemy tso the Musliins, and so were leagued with the Christians against the Muslims. And one of the greatest of calamities, in their opinion, was the Muslims coming off superior over the Tatars ; and one of the greatest of their rejoicings was when the ChrislNians,- and reverse is God's appointment, possessed tllemselves of the frontiers of the Muslims, which ceased not to be under the power of the Muslims, as far as the island of Cyprus, (conquered by the Muslims in the khalifate of the Prince of the believers 70thman Ibn 'AfEan,- let God be gracious to him! which Mu'awiyeh, the SOt1 of Abu Sufyan,- let God be gracious to them both! conquered,+) up to tlle middle of the fourth century; when tllese combattants against God and his Envoy multiplied on the sea-coasts, and elsewhere, and so the C:hristians possessed themselves of the sea-board; and afterwards, owing to them, posses- sed themselves of the Holy City, and other places. For the circumstances of the case as respects them were among the most potent occasions thereof; after which, when God had raised up kings of the Muslims who warred in the way of God, such as Nur ed-dln the Irlartyr, and Salah ed-dln, and their successors, and they had conquered the sea-coasts from the C:hristians, and those who were in league with them, and had also conquered the land of Egypt, they held pos- session of them about two hundred years, and were at peace with them and the Christians, for, until they had conquered the country, the Muslims made +srar upon them; * Alluding, probably, to the discomfiture and repulse which the Mongols received, when they at length invaded Syria, in the beginning of the four- teenth century of our era.

And the learned men of the Wfuslims are already agreed that, as for such as these, intermarriage with them is not allowed, so that a man may not use one of them as his con- cubine, nor take one of them as his wife; and that their sacrifices are not to be partaken o£ And, as for cheese made from their curdled milk, learned men say two things which are well known, respecting it, as in respect to other curdled milk of a dead animal, and the curdled mllk of the Magialls, and the curdled milk of the Franks, of whom it is said that they do not slay victims for sacrifice. The doctrine, then, of Abu Hanlfeh, let God be gracious to him ! and I give praise in Inaking one of the two cita- tions,-is that this cheese is allowed, because the curdled milk becomes not dead with the death of the beast, and the impure receptacle in tlle bellv affects it not with a pollu- tion. And the doctrine of Malik and of Esh-Shafi'yj and I give praise in lnaking the other citation, is that this cheese is impure, because, in their opinion, the curdled milk is impure, for the milk of a dead atlimal and its curdled milk are, in their opinion, impure; and of whomsoever the saG- rifice may not be partaken of, his sacrifice is like a dead animal. And as for their vessels, and their garments, they are like the vessels of the Magians, and the garments of the Magians, according to what is krlowil of the doctrines of the Imams; and Che Wahth,+ on that point, says that " their vessels should not be used, except after they have bece * May not the saying here attributed to the Nusairis, be an imitation of what is said of the " Word of God" itl Rev. xix. 16, "And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords t" + Probably The .Sahth of El-Bukhary, which is the most esteemed of the colIections of authentic traditions bearing this name.</page><page sequence="19">297 washed; for their sacrifices are dead animals; and so, of necessity, if ally part of what they cook of their sacrifices reaches those of their vessels which are made use of, they are thereby polluted." But as for the vessels which one is not obliged to regard as rendered impure, they may be used without any washing, such as vessels for milk, in which they leave not their bouillons, and which they wash before put- ting milk into them. And 'Omar,-let Gkod be gracious to him! indeed, performed his ablutions with the jar of a Christian woman, respecting the irnpurity of which he doubted; so that he did not judge it to be impure, by doubting. And it is not allowed to bury them in the burial-places of the Muslims; nor to pronounce the bene- diction upon any of them who die. For God, let him be exalted! forbade his Prophet,-let the divine benediction and peace be to him! to pronounce the benediction upon hypocrites, such as 'Abdallah Ibn Ubeiy, and those about him, who made a show of praying, and alms-giving, and fasting, and warring on the side of the Muslims, not maKing opeYlly any declaration which was at variance with the religion of the Wfuslims, but keeping such difSerence secret. Says God, let hila be exalted ! " And thou may- est not pronounce the benediction upon any one of them who dies, ever, and thou mayest not preside over his burial; verily, they disbelieve in God and his Envoy, and die as wicked persons." How shall it be, then, with these, who, together with Zendikism and hypocrisy, make a show of infidelity and heresy ? And as for the employing of such as these on the frontiers of the Muslims, and in their for- tresses, or among their troops, that is a great error, equal to one's employing wolves to pasture sheep. For they are the most treacherous of men toward the Muslims, and the pre- fects of their commands, and the most eager of men for the * Kuran, Sur. ix. v. 85. In El-Beidhawy's commentary on this verse we read, " It is reported by tradition that 'Abdallah Ibn Ubeiy called for the Prophet of God, during his illness; and after he had entered where he was, he asked him to forgive him, and that he would wrap him for burial in the covering which was next his body, atld would pronounce the benediction over him. So, after he was dead, he [the Prophet] sent his tunic that he might be wrapt in it for burial, and went out to pronounce the benediction over him; whereupon the verse came down, etc." See Beidhawii Comm. in Coran., vol. i. p. 396; and compare MoAc6ntmed der Prophet, von Dr. Gustav Weil, s. 283.

And they are worse than the lurker about in the army; for, as for him who lurks about, he has an aim which concerns either the commander of the army, or the enemy; while their aims concern our religion, and its Prophet, and its rites, and its kings, and its learlaed men, and its common people, and its people of note. And they are the most eager of men to entrust the fortresses to the enernies of the Muslims, and to alienate the troops from the prefect of comirland, and to withdraw them from obedience to him. So then, it is obligatory upon the prefects of commands to displace them from the rolls of fighting lnen, whether in a fortress, or elsewhere than in a fortress, while the harm they do in a fortress is most seri- ous; and that they employ, instead of them, believing men who hold to the religion of Islam, and the admonition of God, and his Envoy, and the Imams of the Muslims. And when they lnake a show of conversion, respecting that there is a dispute among learned men. So then, those who admit their conversion, bind them to the observance of the law of Islam, and impose upon them tribute of their effects; and those who admit it not, reSect their ranking as of their class, so that whatever is theirs reverts to the Pub- lic Treasury. But, as for these, whenever they are taken up, they make a shovs of conversion, inasmuch as one ac- commodates his doctrine to piety and the hiding of what iS the case with them; and there are those among them who are acquainted with their religion, and those who are not so. So that the way, respecting that, is to look out for what is the case with them; and that they be not sufiered to congregate; and that they be not empowered to bear arms, - not even if they make a part of the fighting men; and that they be bound to the observance of the laws of Islame namely, the five prayers, and the reading of the Kuran; and that some one stay among them, who may teach them the religion of Islain, and interpose between them and their teachers. And let them be prohibited from making a part of the cavalry, and of the bearers of arms, and of those clad in the coats of mail which the fighting men wear; and they may not stay among the troops, just as neither a Jew nor a Christian may stay among the troops.

Afterwards, rises to view the Elevated Palace, the capa- cious structure, the vestibule, the hall of Keiwan, who is the superior over beings, the master of abstinence and chief- tainship, the educator of people of thought and ingenuity, conceived to be incorporations, differing only in grade; for they are said to come into existence in consequence of the union of the Soul with "absolute body." But by the inclination of the Soul to absolute body is first developed, according to this system, motion of volition. It follows from this, that all the emanations previously mentioned are to be considered as involuntary. * From this description it is evident that the Circumambient is Finite Space. t This is the outer concave of the ancient Ptolemaic system of astronomy, as appears from what follows in our text, taken in conllection with the follow- ing passage from an astronomical work of El-FarghAny, an Arabic astron- omer probably of the ninth century of our era: " So then, we say that the number of the spheres which compass all the naotions of the stars, is eight- of which seven belong to the seven planets, and the eighth is the highest belonging to the fixed stars, which is the sphere of the zodiacal signs. And the figure of these spheres is like the figure of globes one within ather. And so the smallest of them is that which is the nearest of them to the earth, which is the globe of the Moon, and the second belongs to 'UtArid, [hIercury,] and the th;rd to Ez-Zaharah, [Venus,] and the fourtla, to tl;e Sun, and the fifth, to El-Mirrlkh, [Mars,] and the sixth, to El-Mushtary, [Jupiter&gt;] and the seventh, to Zuhal, [Saturn,] and the eighth, to the fixed stars.

Afterwards, the Seventh Palace, the hippodrome of Jau- lan, who is the second enlightener, the hastener in journey- ings, without delay, the master of the fashionings of light, the star of the camel-train and couriers, the colorer of things, who has command of striping and reddening, who makes months and years to be, the agent of properties and powers, the befriender as to supplies, the clother, who takes in hand the concerns of common men. And after the seven homogeneous Palaces,+ come other seven heterogeneous, which are the four Corner-stones, and their intermediates, the circumscribing three. * Meaning articles of belief. + The spheres, or concaves, of the seven planets are referred to under this general name. We have proof of this, and a most important help to the un- derstanding of the descriptions above given of these several Palaces, as well 304</page><page sequence="27">305 The first, then, of the Corner-stones is the GUlobe of Ether, which is the heaven of the shooting stars, and the station of the possessors of tails and flowing manes, the hiC,hest o:S the elements, and the agent of heats in sub- stances. Next, the second, is the Globe of Air, with clouds and rains, the place of convolution for the convolution of vapor, the agent of thunder-clouds, and thunder-bolts: and mists , , as a clear indication of the source from which the ideas here expressed were derived, in Esh-Shahrastany's account of the Sabians. This author, after char- acterizing Sabiism as a system inculcating assiduitv in action, rather than a religiolls disposition, goes on to speak of its followers as those who hold to " Spiritual Existences, pure and holy, in substance, act, and state," which are necessary mediators between man and the glorious Creator, in respect to all benefits received from him; so that man must cultivate intercourse with them by "assiduity in action, austerity, and withdrawment from the mundanities of passions." He also tells us that the Sabians hold these Spiritual Exis- tences to be ' the mediating occasions, in respect to prodlletion, and causing to exist, and alteration from one state to another, and the causing of created things to tend from a beginnill(r to a perfection." After this he adds: " Some of thern are the regents of the seven planets in their spheres, which are their Palaces; and to everv Spiritual tllere is a Palace, and to every Palace, a sphere. And the relation of a Spiritual to that Palace which is appropriate to it, is the relation of the soul to the body- so that it is its lord, and its re- gent, and its intendant. And they name the Palaces lords * and often they name them fathers, and the elements mothers; and so the action of the Spirituals is to cause them to move, by a peculiar power, in order that from their motions ac- tualities may arise within natural properties and the elements, and therefrom compoundings, and temperamellts in composites, UpOIl which follow corporeal force3, and to whicll are superadded spiritual souls, like the species of plants and the species of anirnals." He also distinguishes the Spirituals of the Sa- bian system as '&lt; universal" in their " impressions," to which are to be referred the di3tinctions of species, and " particular," to which are to be referred the di3tinctions of one indis-idual of a species from another; and as exerting their influences either in the upper air, in the heavens, in the lower atmosphere, and on the earth, or every where, in all existences, alike. See Esh-Shahrastany's Book of Re/g. and Philos. Sects, pp. 20o-5. This statement by Esh-Shah- rastany makes it quite evident what is intended by the Palaces and the beings occupying them, deecribed in our text; and also throws light upon the union of these Palaces with the four Corner-stones, or elements, presently to be mentioned as the itumediate occasion of the generation of Minerals, Plants and Animals. As to the portraitures of the several regents of the planets given in our text, however, I am unable to show that they have their analogies in any other system, although I do not doubt that such will be found to be the case. Some of the names which these regents bear in the te2ct may be seen by reference to our extract from El-Farghany's astronomical work, to be those which are ordinarily given to some of the planets in Arab astronomy. But others diSer. It is deserving of notice, also, that, although seven Palaces are spoken of in our text, the third and fourth, in the order of their being " let out," namely that of the Sun and that of Mars, are omitted in the description. VOL. II, 3 9</page><page sequence="28">306 and distant thunderings, the uniter of colds in freezing cold, and the life of every thing animate which possesses forin. And the third is the Globe of Water, the giver of mois- ture to thillgs, the irnage of science, the all-embracing, by nzeans of whicll every thing living is constituted, the Inalli- fest by tlle ocean, the filled with substance, the pourer, the profuse. The fourth is tlle Globe of gross Earth, the centre of every subtile circuinambient, the guardian of dr;y-ness in composites, the binder of separating parts. The first two are light, and the last two, lleavy; and as for each two of them, an intermediate determines them, that they may not exceed their bounds. Alld after the fathers and the mothers have moved with the three motiolls, and natural properties incline towards being awalened, and the three generators appear, and the males are filled with the females, the first of things genera- ted is Minerals, which are compounded of the Corner-stones, of which the lowest is sand, and the highest, small pearls; alld as for the second, it is Plants, of which the lowest is the Dush?it,+ and the highest, the tall palm; and the third is Animals, of which the lowest is the intestinal worm, and the highest, man. So then, these are conjoined substances, and a Inaterial not dissevered,2+: spreading itself from the apogee of the Holy One to the perigee of genus, coursing through the worlds, appearing in things which rise to view, and hiding itself in things obscured. In twenty-eight places of Inani- festation is the Perfect in number, which alre three groups of seven,§ successive as to effusion, and the reinforcements * See note + p. 303. t Cuscqhta epithyor^sm, a parasitic climbing plant, without roots, and with- out leaves, but bearing small seeds at its extremities.

Consequently,: " the Perfect in number" denotes some absolute numerical principle pervading all things. It can be nothing else than Unity of number. The EV °t'PXn &lt;V&lt;XV of the Pythagoreans may be referred to as a parallel, provided only that simultane- ousness of existence is ascribed to this principle of Unity and the Deity, for it is said of the Deity, above, that he " is, and before him was not any thing."

Praise be to God who has directed us to his religion the right, and brought us to his way, the straight, and elected us to the creed of our father Ibrahim, atld freely bestomted it upon us ! for it is the ancient doctrine which is the doctrine of Isnza'il the noble.

And I believe tlzat the punishment of the sepulchre and its comfort are a reality; and that Munkir and Nakir are a reality; and the gathering, and the blast,+ and the resurrec- tion, a reality; and the Garden and the Fire, a reality; alld the Book, and the reckoning, and the Sirat,: and the Bal- ance, a reality; and the corrlinffl to all end, and the return- ing to God, a reality; and the seeing of him, a reality; and the allovved and the forbidden, a reality; and that the com- manding of acts of obedience and services, is a thing admit- ted; § and the prohibition of acts of disobedience and oWellces, a thing objective to the intellect; and that prayer, and alrns, aold fastlng, and pilgrimage, and holy warfare, and justice, and beneficence, and the giving to a relative, are obligatory on the believers; and that the coznmission of adultery, and the practice of usury, and obscenity, and depravity, and the killing without right, and games, and things intoxicating, are forbidden to the Muslims. And I believe that the Jinns are existent, and the Shei- tans not unreal; and that Iblis and his troop, the eursed, are the friends of infidels and hypocrites.

These things are the eream of my doctrine, and my belief on my setting out and Iny return; and the refined gold of my fai1;h, and the eredenee of my heart. And therewithal I submit to God itl my inmost soul, and my opell doing, and hope for the end of the attainment of things desired. Alld I am fixed in what my tongue has uttered in the presence of lny ehiefs and my brethren. And we read, " Upon those who believe, and who perform good actions, there rests no guilt in respect to that which they eat, pro- vided they stand in awe, and believe, and perform good actions, and after that stand in awe, and believe, alld after that stand in awe, and do virtuously; and God loves those who do xTirtuously."t The Memorial of the talker with God Musa, let peaee from both of them be to us ! The Allegorical Sense of the Blessed Belief. "He it is who has sent down to thee tlle Boo]c, of whieh some verses are explicit, whieh are the mother of the Book, and others not preeise. So then, as for them in whose hearts is wandering, they follow that whieh is not preeise, pertaining to it, from desire to seduee, and from desire to allegorize it; while no one knows its allegorieal sense, exeept God and those who are firmly established in seienee, who say, 'We believe in it; all is * The family of Muhammed. t Kuran, Sur. v. v. 94. 310</page><page sequence="33">311 from our Ijord ;' and only the possessors of hearts reflect."&gt; I hold fast to the Possessor of majesty and omnipotence, and I fortify myself in the King of the visible realm and the invisible, and I entrust rnyself to the Living One, who dies not, our Deity, and the Deity of tllose who discover to us, and our Lord, and the Lord of our superiors, and our Friend, and the Friend of our friends. And I acknowledge that there is no outward without its inward; and I10 form without its perfect ideav and no rind without its core; and no Light without its NTeil ;t and no IZnowing One without his Gate; and no law without its way; and no way without its verity; and no verity without its letter of revelation; and no letter of revelation without its allegorical sense; and no allegorical sense except to the firmly established in science; and no being firmly established in scierlce e:xcept to the allegorizers. So then, as for our saying God, its allegorical sense is the Word. And the allegorical sense of the world is a place for Inanifesting the divine greatness. And as for the com- ing into existence, it is the posteriority of the caused to the cause, and the latter's preceding the former, agreeably to convincing proofs, a priori and a posteriort, with re-ference to order, by argumellt from order of time, not order of place. And as for potentiality, it is the essence of the being in need,: and the ordaining of the realization of the relation of cause to effect. And "the essentially Necessary" implies the absurdity of defining by that which is devoid of quality. And as for the Ma'na's: being established as pre-existent and eternal, and the hallowing of the self-existently Neces- sary, and the exempting of him from his qualities, it is that we abstract from him every thing which occurs to our minds, and is fixed in our perceptions; and we know that * Kuran, Sur. iii. v. 5. El-Beidhawy explains the expression " mother of the Book," in this passage, to mean " its root, that to which the rest of it amounts." This orthodox commentator is obliged to admit that an allegorical sense per- tairling to some verses of the Kuran, is here recognized; but he claims that there are points left indefinite because God reserves to himself the knowledge of them, and that man has no concern with the allegorical sense, except where it becomes necessary to lean upon it with reference to faith or practice.

And as for prophecy and communication by rnessage, they are the ntanifestation of the A;Tord ill the Veil, and the setting up of tlle Guide, and the Con.ductor, alzd the Gate, to the open way of truth and the path of rectitude. And as for the l'rophet, he is the informer with regard to funda- mentals, callin.g to that to which the EnaroyVc calls. And as for the Envoy, he is the Natik, calling to the two Roots, the Sabik and the Taly, and the three Branches, the Jedd and the Fath and the Khibyal,+ which make the higller five, comprising perfectioll. The Watik is an outward, of which the inward is the Taly, to which latter it peltains to train and manage, while the opposite is the case in regard to composilltr and putting together. Alld as for the collfirma- tiOll of communication lDy me3sage, bty means of proof and analogy, it is the allegorical sense of the Asas,: alad the rnanifestation to the intelligent arnong men of ideas com- posed by tlle Ntitil. And as for the seladilog down of the Leaf and the Book, alad Jebril's brilogilzg the Address, it is the coming of aid to the Natik from the Sabik, and its directing with reference to composing, alad its assisting in the writing out. The embodinlent of forn objective to the intellect is necessarJr; and the Address is the verification of thilags determined by tlle intellect. And as for the favorite an.gels, they are the knowing, active forces in the upper and lower worlds. And as for their glorifying :lit,ht and day, and their ascribing of dominion for people of the faith, with askilag of forgiveness, it is the continuing of those forces to order the succession of the AInrs, and the mani- festation of the properties thereo:E, in thei.r known place, without illtermissioll.§ Alld the ILarubis are the forces * Muhammed. + The Jedd, or the Prinaogenitor, the Fath., or the Opening, and the Khiyal, or the Inzage, are here, evidently, used as names of the Primitive Hiyuly the Circumanabient, and the Stellar Sphere. t See note * p. 266. 0 What is here allegorized will be best understood by another quotation from Esh-Shahrastany's staterYlent of the belief of the Sabians in re{rard to the so callefl Spirituals. He says, "And they create in hallowing and glorifyingX not disobeying God as to that which he comrnands, and doing that which they</page><page sequence="35">313 whieh support the Watiks in composing the letter of revela- tion.

And as for the punishment of the sepulehre, it is the impression made upon the soul by the shaekle of that whieh eomes to it of Hiyuly-forms, opposed to its natural properties; which is in the way of fettering. And the eomfort of the sepulehre is the loss of the impres- sion made upon it therebyt and its taking refuge in the veri- fieation of the apprehensions pertaining to its Palaee-like instruments ;t whicll is by the power of abstraetion. And as for the fixing by Munkir and Waklr, it is the mastery of the forees of passiollate desire and anger. And as for the gathering, it is the hastening of souls in pursuing the route of tlleir impediments, and their deeamping to the rear-guard of their instruments,: and the eonclusion from premises of ereatures, in respect to their days, and the veritv of the idea of a day which eal]s all men to their Itnam. And as for the awakening, it is the rnanifestation of souls in world after world, in aecordance with their aequirements of wrong and erime. And as for the allegorical sense of the resur- reetion, the resurreetioll of itldividual souls is separation from.the apprehensions of sense, and eorporeal ilastruments; and the resurreetion of laws and religions is the appear- are commanded .........
