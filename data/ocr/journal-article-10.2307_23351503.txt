<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEGUANZ1 AND HUANG-LAO THOUGHT R.P. PEERENBOOM The Mawangdui discovery of four ancient lost texts referred to as the Silk Manuscripts of Huang-Lao (Huang-Lao boshu 9 — hereafter, Boshu) has rekindled interest in the Heguanzi The occurrence of numerous parallel passages between the Heguanzi and the Boshu has forced sinologists to rethink the long accepted view of the former as a post-Han apocryphal work. The emerging consensus is that while the Heguanzi may be a composite of the writings of multiple authors repre senting various schools of thought, much if not all of it belongs to the late Warring States to Han periods, though external evidence is only firm from about A.D. 500.1 In this article, I examine the relation between the Heguanzi and Huang-Lao thought as represented in the Boshu. I first survey the recent attempts by scholars to sort out the various strands of thought present in the eclectic Heguanzi and to explain its relation to Huang-Lao. I argue that many of the chapters display key features of Huang-Lao thought, most notably a commitment to foundational naturalism and natural law that is first articulated in mature form in the Boshu. In contending that parts of the Heguanzi and Huang-Lao thought in general espouse a foundational naturalism, I intend the following. First, as a naturalism, humans are conceived of as part of the cosmic natural order understood as an organic or holistic system or ecosystem. In the language of Huang-Lao, dao as the cosmic natural order embraces both the way of 1. See Bruce C.

Of course, given the imprecise dating of both the Boshu and the Heguanzi, it is difficult to determine who was citing whom.

It is taken to be the highest value or realm of highest value. Third, and correlate to the second, the human-social order must be consistent and compatible with the cosmic natural order rather than the natural order being subservient to the whims and needs of humans. Huang-Lao advances a foundational naturalism in that the cosmic natural order serves as the basis, the foundation, for construction of the human order. This means not simply that human behavior and social institutions are to be modeled on the way of nature. The natural order constitutes the foundation for the human social order in the more radical sense that the correct social order is held to be implicated in the cosmic order. The task for humans is to discover and implement it. In this way, the Boshu naturalizes the human order by grounding it in a predetermined natural order.3 The term natural law has served many masters. It has been applied to 2. Roger Ames has recently called into question the appropriateness of the organic or organismic metaphor as a characterization of Chinese philosophy on the grounds that it a) entails a sense of wholeness typical of many Western cosmogonic traditions but absent in the self-generative cosmologies of pre-Qin China, b) imparts a potential ity/actuality distinction that obviates the sui generis character and unduly restricts the creativity of the particular, and most importantly, c) conjures up images of Aristotelian teleology and the notion of a progressive and steady advance toward a predetermined perfection; see Ames, "The Focus Field Self in Classical Confucianism," in Concepts of Self: East West Perspectives, ed. Wimal Dissanayake (Honolulu: East West Center, forth coming). While Ames' criticisms serve notice that one must take care in employing the organism metaphor—as one must with any metaphor, particularly one laden with philosophical associations from an alternative tradition — they do not require its abandonment. Its continued use may be justified in that it does bring out the contrast between the holistic world view of much Chinese philosophy in which the cosmic natural order embraces both humans and non-human nature and a dualistic view in which humans are juxtaposed to nature. This also justifies, in my opinion, the use of the term 'ecosystem' even though normative order does not emerge out of interaction among the members of the system but is conceptually predetermined. Dao as the de facto order is indeed the totality comprised by the particulars which do exist in the given moment such that on a descriptive level dao is the result of an interaction of its constituent parts. Prescriptively, or normatively, however, dao cum the cosmic natural order is predetermined. 3. The foundational character of Huang-Lao naturalism is signalled primarily in three ways: by the transcendence of the cosmic natural order, the realist underpin nings of Huang-Lao philosophy, and the author's correspondence theory of language and epistemology; see R.P. Peerenboom, Law and Morality in Ancient China: The Silk Manuscripts of Huang-Lao (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="3">R.P. PEERENBOOM 171 such unlikely bedfellows as Plato, Hamurabi, Mohammed, Aquinas, Hobbes, Kant, Han Fei, Shang Yang, Confucius, and more recently, the authors of the Boshu and Heguanzi.4 The well-known contemporary jurisprudes Jeffrie Murphy and Jules Coleman offer two basic charac teristics of classical natural law theories: a) moral validity is a logically necessary condition for legal validity, and b) the moral order is part of the natural order —moral duties being in some sense "read off" from essences or purposes fixed (perhaps by God) in nature.5 Though con temporary natural law theorists often reject the second condition while accepting the first, the authors of the Boshu and (parts of) the Heguanzi accept both. Unlike the positive laws of the Legalists Han Fei and Shang Yang, laws in the Boshu and Heguanzi are necessarily just laws; they are necessarily just or moral laws because the laws governing the human social order are predicated on and discovered in dao, the normative cosmic natural order. Before turning to a detailed comparison of our two primary works, it is worth noting that the foundational naturalism and natural law theories of the Boshu and Heguanzi did not spring fully bloomed from the minds of these authors alone. Many of the ideas which underwrite Huang-Lao foundational naturalism and natural law theory are present in other late Warring States texts which may, and in some cases almost certainly do, predate the Boshu and Heguanzi. a) Nature as an impersonal, non-anthropomorphic order: Laozi, Xunzi, Shen Dao Fragments. b) Natural order (embracing both the order of non-human nature 4.

Heguanzi and Huang-Lao The relation between Huang-Lao and Heguanzi has long been sus pected. Lu Dian Hfffl (1042-1102) of the Northern Song traces the text to Huang-Lao and the doctrine of xing ming.7 Struck by the many parallel passages and the similarity of ideas found in the Heguanzi and the Boshu, a host of modern commentators have followed Lu in charac terizing the Heguanzi as a Huang-Lao work.8 Despite the many efforts to elucidate the relation between the Heguanzi and Huang-Lao, problems remain. Opinions differ as to what parts of the text are authentic.9 Au thorship—both the immediate question of which chapters are written by whom and the ancillary issue of the relation of authorship to thought— 6. I discuss these ideas and the evolution of Huang-Lao thought at length in Law and Morality in Ancient China. 7.

PEERENBOOM 173 remains problematic. Neugebauer divides the text into six sections, Ogata into at least eight. Graham thinks that while all but two chapters are related, the text advances three different ideals of government: Legalist, Yin Yang (Huang-Lao) and Daoist anarchist. There are methodological complications as well. In comparing the Heguanzi to the Boshu and the Huang-Lao school, some authors have been content to select similar or contrasting ideas regardless of their location, taking them all as equally representative of Heguanzi and ignoring the problem of authenticity and the possible presence of different strata or schools of thought within the text. Given the eclectic character of the text, if one is to analyze successfully its relation to Huang-Lao, one must first sort out, virtually on a chapter by chapter basis, the various schools or strata. To be sure, this is no easy task. Indeed, the best efforts of several formidable sinologists to classify the various chapters have produced the decidedly mixed results noted above. In analyzing the text, scholars have employed various techniques. Some have turned to philological evidence, examining rhyme schemes, key terms associated with a certain geographical location, text or school of thought, parallel passages in the classical corpus and so forth. Others have turned to historical and literary standards: the depiction of historical events or the championing of unorthodox quasi-historical exemplars — Cheng Jiu J&amp;Wj and Jiu Huang AM (the Nine Majesties) — as opposed to orthodox figures such as Yao and Shun. Many have taken similarity of thought as the standard for classification, with the Boshu serving as the primary source and standard of Huang-Lao thought. Yet for this latter method to be effective, one must first state what con stitutes the essence of Huang-Lao thought in general and the Boshu in particular. One needs, in short, to determine criteria for distinguishing Huang-Lao and the Boshu from other classical schools and philosophical works. Some —citing, for instance, the numerous parallel passages — have appealed to language and style to demonstrate that Heguanzi is a Huang-Lao work, probably by Chu authors.10 Yet this approach is open to the objection that late Warring States and early Han texts are often extremely eclectic, commonly borrowing ideas and passages from many texts and schools while turning them to their own ends. Indeed, one finds in the Heguanzi passages from diverse works (though the number of passages from the Boshu far exceeds that of any other text) as well as 10. This method is nearly universal among commentators, though not all agree that the author is from Chu; see Graham, "Ho-kuan-tzu," 508; Williams, "Ho-kuan tzu," 116; Li Xueqin, "Boshu yu Heguanzi," 57; Ogata Torn, "Kakkanshi no seiritsu," 18-19.</page><page sequence="6">174 HEG UANZI AND HUANG-LAO THOUGHT Confucian, Legalist, Mohist, Yin Yang Five Phases and School of Names ideas. Given Sima Tan's description of Huang-Lao as the school which selects the best from the others,11 several commentators have made a virtue of necessity by taking Heguanzi's eclecticism as evidence of its Huang-Lao character.12 Were eclecticism limited to Huang-Lao texts, this would be a more convincing argument. Christopher Rand has focused on military theory, arguing that the Heguanzi and the Boshu are examples of Huang-Lao or syncretic thought which calls for a comple mentary balance between the civil (wen 3C) and martial (wu jf£), and provides a metaphysical justification for warfare as part of the cosmic order.13 Others, most notably Wu Guang M ft, have pointed to a simi larity between the social and political philosophy of the Heguanzi and the Boshu.u Based on analysis of the Boshu's philosophy, one can iden tify the following salient similarities, not all of which are peculiar to Huang-Lao. First, both the Boshu and Heguanzi call for a centralized, unified state. While the former turns to the Yellow Emperor as the legendary ruler who unified the empire, the latter turns to Cheng Jiu and the Jiu Huang (Nine Majesties). Nevertheless, the message is the same: by holding fast to the one and basing the political order on the natural order, one is able to rule over the four seas as one family without end.15 While there is to be but one ruler,16 he is to be a servant of the people:17 ASSKS 11.

In Rand's terms, both the Heguanzi and Boshu represent syncretic-rationalist metaphysical-ethical-pragmatic military philosophies; see Rand, "Chinese Military Thought," 206-218. Heguanzi is categorized as a military text in the Han shu 81 S, though it was later deleted as a repetition of a text listed under Daoism. Heguanzi the person is often thought to have been a military man, in part because his pseudonym refers to a pheasant cap which "had a definite military significance"; Williams, "Ho kuan tzu," 4. 14.

PEERENBOOM 175 "the ruler of man treats his people as his children" (6/18b/3); ^ "to act in accordance with the people is the essence of the way" (4/10a/4). The exemplary ruler is attributed virtues usually associated with Confucianism: benevolence (ren -(Z), moral judgment (yi H), loyalty (zhong J$l) and trustworthiness (xin fit; 6/16b/6). Further, he is required to balance martiality (wu) with civility (wen; 4/8a/8), and punishments (xing ffij) with rewards (de 9/9a/6).18 As in the Boshu, punishments and rewards are to be coordinated with the natural order, with rewards dispensed in three seasons and punishments in one (10/16a/ll).19 Finally, the ruler demonstrates his concern for the people by safeguarding their economic well-being, ensuring sufficient supplies and distributing the wealth of the state (6/16b/8).20 Like the Boshu, the Heguanzi attempts to justify a hierarchical society as natural (4/6a/7, 4/10a/10).21 At the same time, society is portrayed as meritocratic (4/6b/9, 4/1 Ob/5, 6/15b/3).22 As for the relation between ruler and minister, each has his own role: "The way of the ruler is to know men; the way of the minister is to know daily affairs" (6/16b/8).B With each performing his own duties, the ruler and ministers cooperate (6/18b/5).24 The animosity and mistrust which characterize the ruler-minister relation for Shang Yang and Han Fei are conspicuously absent. All of the above approaches have their value, especially when taken together. By examining the collective results, a consensual portrait begins to emerge as to which chapters are indeed representative of Huang-Lao thought. The portrait may be brought into even sharper focus by making use of the criteria of foundational naturalism and its corollary natural law. Based primarily on these criteria, I have provisionally identified the chapters most likely to be Huang-Lao as 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and ll.25 Before examining these chapters, a few words are in order as to the remainder. Chapters 1, 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 are most likely not Huang-Lao. A.C. Graham has identified chapter 1 as Legalist.26 That the ruler is the 18. See Boshu 69:111b, 51:37b. 19. See Boshu 57:66b. 20.

That the way/natural order is the standard for political order and the ground for laws differentiates the foundation al naturalism and natural law theory of Huang-Lao from the pragmatic legal positivism of the Legalists. Chapter 7 rejects the notion that humans are to follow nature. And while acknowledging that laws may be necessary to ensure proper order, the author denies that they are sufficient. In the end, proper order is dependent on the judgment of a sage. Similarly, chapter 14 advances a rule of man rather than a rule of law, as discussed more fully below. Chapter 13, identified by Graham as "Daoist anarchist," is similar to the "primitivist" chapters of the Laozi and Zhuangzi, which is inconsis tent with the centralizing and unifying direction of Huang-Lao political theory.27 In addition, the author denies that there is one right way to govern. Rather, the right way to govern depends on the particular circumstances and the characteristics of those in power. This is more in keeping with the position of Confucianism and classical Daoism than the foundationalism of Huang-Lao. Chapter 16, long suspected to be a military text of Pang Xuan M 'M, repeats the passage of chapter 13 denying the existence of one right way to govern. Chapter 19 is also believed to be part of the military text of Pang Xuan. It advocates military conquest without fighting. However, Huang-Lao insists that conflict is inevitable, part of the cosmic order, and hence one must wage war when the time is right or perish. Chapters 12,17, 18 share some characteristics of Huang-Lao thought but because of differences in tone, style, emphasis or appeal to orthodox exemplary figures appear to represent, if not a different school, at least a different sect than the core Huang-Lao chapters. Chapter 15 is eclectic, but other than that does not appear to be part of Huang-Lao. Chapter 2 simply does not provide enough information to locate it with any con fidence. My assessments gain some initial support from a survey of the paral lels between the Boshu and HeguanziThere are parallels between the Jingfa M.$k section of the Boshu and chapters 4, 6, 8, 9,10 and 14 of the Heguanzi. All have been provisionally identified as core Huang-Lao 27. Graham, "Ho-kuan-tzu," 527. 28. This line of argument is obviously limited. In some cases, the parallel passages contain ideas which are also the basis for claiming a similarity in content, and hence for identifying the chapters as Huang-Lao.</page><page sequence="9">R.P. PEERENBOOM 177 chapters except 14. However, the parallel in 14 is questionable in that the phrase — dao shengfa (the way gives rise to law) —is imbed ded in a passage in the Heguanzi whose meaning, as Tang Lan Hf SB notes and I discuss below, runs counter to that of the Boshu passage.29 Chapter 12, which Graham considers part of a "Daoist anarchist" block, has two parallel passages with the Shiliu jing section, not the Jingfa. The Shiliu jing, in addition to presenting several hagiographical anecdotes regarding the Yellow Emperor, places greater emphasis on military affairs than the predominantly political Jingfa. Chapter 12, for its part, differs from the core Huang-Lao chapters of the Heguanzi in its use of historical stories as a narrative device. Further, like the Shiliu jing, it devotes considerable attention to military affairs.30 Finally, chapter 17 contains a parallel to the Cheng $§ section. While it evinces many Huang-Lao ideas, it appears to have been written by a different author than the core chapters, and indeed has long been assumed to be a later addition.31 Foundational Naturalism in the Heguanzi In the Heguanzi, tian ^ and di ife refer to an impersonal natural order, not simply the firmament and earth: What we call tian is not the azure qi what we call di is not this conglomerated soil. When we say tian we mean that which lets things be so without suppression; when we say di we mean that which makes things even and cannot be disordered (8/lb/5). The natural order is rule-governed, constant and regular: pfx if 5c # 29. See Tang Lan, "Mawangdui chutu Laozi yiben juanqian guyishu de yanjiu" Jfe Kaogu xuebao 17. 30. Chapter 12 also contains a parallel passage to chapters 13 and 16. Chapter 13 is not consistent with the Huang-Lao chapters, as Graham has observed. Perhaps it was included on the basis of the parallel to chapter 12 which, given its Huang-Lao characteristics, served as a bridge to the core Huang-Lao chapters. Similarly, chapter 16 is a military discussion which many believe to be part of the military text of Pang Xuan S8 £§ mentioned in the "Yi wen zhi" W X /£. Given the military focus along with the mention of Pang Xuan in chapter 19, there is reason to believe that it too originally belonged to the Pang Xuan text. It may have been inserted along with chapter 16 —which in turn may have been inserted because of its parallel to chapter 12, which despite its Huang-Lao characteristics and parallels to the Shiliu jirig appears to be somewhat out of step with the core Huang-Lao chapters of the Heguanzi. 31.

One passage which also appears in the Boshu attests not only to the patterned regularity of the natural order but to the appro priateness of the natural order as a model for the human social order: The sun reliably rises and sets, north and south have their extre mities — these are the models for measurements. The moon reliably waxes and wanes, there is a constancy to advancement and with drawal — these are the models for calculation. The stellar formations not deviating from their orderly progression, alternating without interference — these are the models for positions. Heaven illumines the three in order to fix the one (10/16a/4).33 As in the Boshu, the natural order consists of the triad tian-di-ren Aife A (heaven-earth-humans): iff A% AVHii'liE—-fe, "The extreme of intuition and illumination (shen ming iff B£j) is the affairs of heaven, earth and humans returning to the one" (10/15a/13). As such, it encom passes both the human order and that of non-human nature. Indeed, as part of the larger cosmic order, both the human order and that of nature are governed by the same rules (8/la/12): A Al^I^ite AIWISI, "Heaven and humans share the same patternation (wen); earth and humans share the same principles (Zf)."34 There are many general statements as to the need to predicate the human social order on the natural order (4/8b/6): "What lets things go and leaves all to positional advantage is tian. Let things go and leave all to positional advantage. Hence no one is capable of taking charge who does not tian (act in accordance with the natural order)." Similar sentiments are expressed in the Boshu (53:47b): A A fPJ % K If "Where one treats heaven as heaven (tian tian), one attains intuition (shen)." The sage is not to rely on his own judgment as to what is best in a given situation but to take as his model the natural order: 32. Graham translates: "the pattern in things as it essentially is"; Graham, "Ho-kuan tzu," 512. 33. The Boshu (53:49b) reads: "The stellar formations have their quantifiable relations, and do not deviate from their paths — these are the models for reliability (xin •ft!).

The sage takes them (heaven and earth) as his model (6/15a/6).35 As in the Boshu, there is a premium placed on timeliness. One must act in consort with the seasons and the rhythms of the natural order or else suffer the inevitable consequences: There is a constancy to qi, its principles determined by heaven and earth. Actions running contrary to natural timeliness (tian shi are inauspicious and bring disaster (6/15b/3).36 Specific social policies are determined by the natural order. As noted above, rewards are to be disbursed in spring, summer and autumn, pun ishments enforced and executions carried out in winter. Deployment of the military must likewise be coordinated with heaven and earth: "The method of using troops is to do so in accor dance with heaven, earth and humans" (14/7a/12).37 Perhaps most im portantly, the laws adopted by the ruler and society are to be grounded in the natural order. Natural Law in the Heguattzi Like the Boshu, the Heguanzi promotes rule of law as a primary means of effecting social order. sit When an exemplary ruler adheres to established law, subsequent 35.

When a negligent ruler does not comply, the present generation is destroyed (6/18b/13).38 Chapter 8 of the Heguanzi presents a quasi-historical account of the descent from past Utopias where law was unnecessary to contemporary realities where it is. Ideally, one is to govern through intuitive or spirit ual transformation (shen hua If {k). Only as a last resort does one turn to rule of law. Unfortunately, the demands of the present age necessitate such harsh measures. Not only are rulers not always as wise as the legends of yesteryear, but people nowadays are not as cooperative and other-regarding as they may have been in the past.39 Rule of law, while not ideal, has its merits, perhaps the greatest being impartiality: *£:i§'{£ Srfegfcfi- "Law causes the rejection of partiality (si %) and the attain ment of impartiality {gong £•)" (8/5b/9). When like cases are treated alike, fairness is enhanced.40 As characteristic of natural law theories, that of the Heguanzi posits an inseparable link between law and morality:41 What is right is that to which the law is intimately related; what is wrong is that from which the law is distinct; what is right is inti mately related to the law, and hence strong; what is wrong is distinct from law, and hence perishes (5/12b/ll). Law must uphold the way:42 What protects the one way (yi dao — M) and regulates the myriad things is law. Law is what protects the inner [court]; ordinances are what outwardly regulate. Law does not defeat what is right (8/3a/6). 38. See also 7/21 a/9: "If the ruler's understanding is not clear he takes the nobles as the way, his own intentions as the law . . . What calamity exceeds this? One such as this, on the day of retreat, subsequently understands his command is lost." Chapter 7, however, advances not rule of foundational natural law but a rule of law which depends in the final analysis on the judgment of sages. For rule of law in the Boshu, see 47:20b; and Peerenboom, "Natural Law in the Huang-Lao Boshu." 39.

PEERENBOOM 181 Many commentators have pointed to another passage seemingly par allel to the Boshu which relates law to dao: "Worth generates sagehood, sagehood the way, the way law (dao shengfa), law intuition and intuition illumination/clarity" (14/8a/l 0). While the phrase dao sheng fa does occur in the Boshu, it is part of a philosophy of law which is dramatically at odds with that expressed in this passage from the Heguanzi. In the latter, the sage is arguably the ultimate source of the way, a notion best expressed in Confucius' dictum that "it is human beings who are capable of broadening the way, not the way that is capable of broadening human beings" (15:29). The sage-judge in the Confucian system relies on his own discretion and intuitive judgment as to what is best in a specific situation.43 In contrast, Huang-Lao law is a product of a discovered foundational way, and grounded in a predetermined natural order. One does well to dis tinguish between (Confucian) coherence theories of law and (Huang Lao) natural law in a strict foundational sense, both of which reject legal positivism and separability of law from morality.44 Both types of theory are present in the Heguanzi. The existence of a strict natural law theory of the type found in the Boshu is confirmed by the grounding of law in the discovered, norma tively privileged, natural order: "Law is heaven and earth's instrument of proper order. When law is used incorrectly, original virtuous potency is not realized" (10/5b/2). The description of laws as the commands (ming np) of the natural order attests to the predetermined character of Heguanzi's natural law: f=J til "What gives rise to law is command. What is given rise to by law is also command. Command is what is so of itself" (5/12b/12). Lest anyone mistake the predetermined commands of the natural order for positivist commands of the sovereign, the author adds, Only the sage can thoroughly investigate the actualities of the 43. In advocating rule of man rather than rule of natural law, the position of the author is closer to that advanced in the "Xinshu shang" chapter of the Guanzi: "Laws are derived from authoritative discretion (quati and authoritative discretion is derived from the way"; Guanzi, lbll. 44.

Only the law (fa) of the Way impartially governs and illumines. When the handle of the Dipper points East, South, West, North, it is spring, summer, fall, winter. With the handle of the Dipper circulating on high, affairs are established below. With it pointing in one direction, the four frontiers are completed. This is the employment of law by the Way (5/12a/13). In the epistemology of the Heguanzi, the sage discovers the predeter mined Way. He is not a creator of the way(s), but a mediator between the given natural order and the human social order; he is responsible for effecting through legislation a social order which reflects the natural order. He takes what he has discovered through intuitive reflection (shen ) and translates it into enlightened social policies and laws which illumine or clarify (ming B^) the Way for others: As being here law is called near; as issuing forth to transform the other it is called far. From the near it arrives, so is called intuition (shen)-, from the far it returns, so is called illumination (ming). The illumination is here, its radiance illumines the other. Its affairs are formed here, its achievements complete the other. What transforms the other from here is law. The generator of law is myself, the completer of law is the other. The generator of law is something which is present every day and never flags. One for whom the generating and completing are in himself is called the sage (5/12a/4). The price to pay for a wayward sage who generates or legislates law not in accordance with the Way cum natural order but in light of his own best judgment as to what is appropriate in the context is chaos, both social and cosmic: When knowledge lacks the Way, the patternation of heaven is dis ordered above, the principles of earth obliterated below, harmony among humans cut off in the middle . . . (8/2a/4). The final standard for proper order, the object of true knowledge, is heaven and earth, not man:</page><page sequence="15">R.P. PEERENBOOM 183 The Supreme Majesty asked the Supreme One, 'Of these three — heaven, earth and man's work—which is most urgent?' Said the Supreme One, 'Inward correction by care of the quintes sence and nurturing of intuition are how one emulates heaven. 'Heaven' is that in which intuition and illumination are rooted' (10/15a/7).45 Heaven and earth are the correct standards for forms and intuitive reflection (sheri) (8/1 b/2). Significantly, chapter one, identified by Graham as Legalist, advances a contrary thesis. The ultimate authority is not heaven, the natural order or the Way, but the ruler: "The ruler is the one who constitutes the correct standard for intuition and clarity" (l/lb/2). As in the Boshu, the natural law philosophy of the Heguanzi serves as a theoretical limit on the unbridled powers of the Legalist ruler. Realism in the Heguanzi One offshoot of the Boshu's foundational naturalism and epistemol ogy of discovery is its realist philosophy of language. Rather than a matter of convention and pragmatic utility, names come preassigned, attached as it were to the determinate form of the real objects to which they refer: (&amp;) (&amp;) £J^££."Whena thing is forthcoming, its form precedes it. Established in accordance with its form, it is named in accordance with its name" (81:142b). There is a passage in the Heguanzi which suggests a similar realist view: tb, There being the one there is cji, then the idea (yi M), then the pic ture (tu H), then the name, then the form, then the affair, then the covenant. The covenant being decided the time is born, the time being set the thing is born. Therefore superimpositions of cji make the time, of covenants the project, of projects the achievement, of 45. See also 10/14a/4: "The Supreme One is that which maintains the organization of the same-on-the-widest-scale, tunes the Cji of the Supreme Immensity, and corrects the positions of the intuitive and illumined."</page><page sequence="16">184 HEGUANZ1 AND HUANG-LAO THOUGHT achievements gain and loss, of gains and losses fortune and mis fortune, and of the myriad things victory and defeat. All of them spring from the qi, interchange along the way, are covenanted for in affairs, are corrected by the time, are distinguished through names and completed by law (5/1 lb/7; Graham, 514). Graham, for one, toys with the idea that this passage presents "the rudiments of a 'Realist' theory of naming." He points out that "it would seem theoretically possible for ancient Chinese to conceive Heaven personified after the analogy of the human ruler as fixing the names of things by his decree before generating them." Yet in the end he dismisses the idea, claiming that "no school except the Mohists went as far as that in personifying Heaven, and it was in the Mohist school that the 'Nominalist7 theory of naming developed."46 This difficult passage is surely open to a variety of interpretations. What exactly is one to make of yi (idea? intention? cognitive motive or plan?) or tu (picture? scheme? representation? plan?). It is unlikely that yi means "idea" and tu "picture" in a Wittgensteinian sense. And what is the philosophical significance of the Heguanzi's inversion of names and forms? Perhaps it indicates a nominalist theory of naming after all: names are generated according to ideas/intentions and images/plans; how we name things determines how we cut up the world and hence generates forms which in turn shape our everyday affairs. On the other hand, the ultimate source of names and so forth is qi, the primal quasi-materialist energy which constitutes the stuff of reality. Further, one need not assume as Graham does that only a personified heaven can be a source of a realist theory of naming. As observed in the Boshu, names are grounded in an impersonal, rule-governed natural order. Indeed, the author states, ^ IE ^ Jik fP "tian rectifies names and initiates them" (66:97a). Thus, in light of the strong Huang-Lao char acter of chapter 5 of the Heguanzi, it is possible that the author had in mind a realist theory of names similar to that of the Boshu. At the very least, such a position is consistent with his foundational epistemology and theory of a discovered natural law. I have been primarily concerned to demonstrate that there is in the Heguanzi a well-articulated foundational naturalism and natural law philosophy of the type presented in the Boshu. Yet the Heguanzi is not the Boshu. There are differences, even between the core Huang-Lao chapters and the Boshu, and these differences deserve to be noted. Several have already been mentioned, such as the alternative line of 46. Graham, "Ho-kuan-tzu," 514.</page><page sequence="17">R.P. PEERENBOOM 185 mythic heroes. Others have been discussed elsewhere, notably the Heguanzi's introduction of the notion of yuan qi 7C M, (primal or original qi), believed by some commentators to be a development of and advancement on the materialist ideas of the Boshu,47 One difference which merits comment is the pervasive presence of an integrated yin yang five phase theory in the Heguanzi. There is little mention of the five phases in the Boshu, though much of yin yang. The fully realized synthesis of yin yang and the five phases in the Heguanzi may indicate a later date of composition. Of course, this is highly speculative. The synthesis may have occurred before the writing of the Boshu, whose author may either simply not have known of it or deliberately decided not to make use of it. Another difference is that, despite Lu Dian's comment, the doctrine of xing ming does not appear to be as developed or philosophically central in the Heguanzi as in the Boshu. From an epistemological perspective, the Heguanzi places less emphasis on the attainment of emptiness and tranquility (xu jing iM Sf) as a means to eliminate biases and gain objec tivity. Conversely, it pays closer attention to the role of the sage in the "discovery" of the way through intuition and illumination (shen ming), suggesting that the author(s) were less sanguine about the notion of objective and impartial discovery than the author of the Boshu. Indeed, perhaps the biggest difference in the two texts concerns the role of the sage. In the Heguanzi, the sage is able to subdivide as he pleases within the general framework given by nature: The lay-out of members and placing of joints, unchanging for a myriad ages, is from the positions of heaven and earth; the dividing of things and sequencing of names, so that patterns and principles are clear and distinct, is from the equalizing by intuitive sages (11/21 a/12). utmnmniz The multiple we ourselves make multiple (10/19a/l). The Heguanzi seems to be grappling with the question: to what extent are the natural and human social orders given? In the Boshu, things come with forms and names preassigned, leaving little room for the creative input of humans. To be sure each thing may not have a unique form and name. Thus there might be some room to choose between 47.

And while the human social order must comply with the laws and principles set by the natural order, these laws may be underdetermining, thus allowing for more than one possible social order. Nevertheless, the choices seem to be more severely constrained for the Boshu's sage than Heguanzi's in that the latter is responsible for sorting out the details of the human order within the overall guidelines set by the natural order. The greater degree of input ceded the sage in the Heguanzi is evi denced in the distinction between laws (fa) and ordinances (ling ^-) encountered in a passage cited earlier: ft What protects the one way and regulates the myriad things is law. Law is what protects the inner [court]; ordinances are what out wardly regulate. Law does not defeat what is right (8/3a/6). While fa (laws) represent fundamental metaphysical cum moral prin ciples, ling (ordinances) represent specific political decrees, policies or orders based on the laws. Unlike laws, which are given in the natural law theory of the Heguanzi, ordinances represent applications of the law as interpreted by the sage in the specific context.48 Whatever their differences, the Boshu and (parts of) the Heguanzi share a common Huang-Lao heritage. Nowhere is this more apparent than in their support of a philosophy of foundational naturalism and natural law. 48. For a similar view, see Tan Jiajian, "Heguanzi," 59-60.</page></plain_text>
