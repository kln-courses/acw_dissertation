<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. LII, No. 2, June 1992 The Epistemic Role of Qualitative Content TEODOREW. SaCHi JR. Muhlenberg College Many mental states, especially- sensations and emotions, have a particular type of feeling associated with them. To be in one of these states-seeing red, hearing a loud noise, being afraid, etc.-is to have a certain sort of expe- rience. The affective component of these mental states-their "raw feels," so to speak-is their qualitative content. According to traditional empiri- cism, our knowledge of this qualitative content grounds our knowledge of the external world, for it is what our most fundamental concepts, i.e., our sensory concepts, refer to. The assumption here is that the meaning of a sen- sory concept is the sensation for which it stands. On this view, the meaning of the word "pain," for example, is the sensation of pain. Anyone who had not experienced pain would not know what "pain" means. Many contemporary materialists reject this view on the grounds that it is based on a mistaken theory of meaning. According to them, the meaning of a concept is determined by the network of concepts in which it is embedded.' Furthermore, one can know a mental concept's place in the network without knowing its qualitative content.2 Consequently, a knowledge of qualitative content is not necessary for a knowledge of meaning. Since qualitative con- tent is irrelevant to meaning, it plays no epistemically significant role in limiting belief. Having a knowledge of the qualitative content associated with a mental term may not be essential for having a knowledge of its meaning. But it is essential, I believe, for having a complete knowledge of its meaning. In other words, one may have an understanding of a mental term even though one has no knowledge of its qualitative content. But other things being equal, one who has a knowledge of its qualitative content will have a better under- standing of it than one who does not. For not only will such a person be bet- ter able to use the term, she will also know why it is used as it is. Since our 1 Paul Churchiand, Matter and Consciousness (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1984), p. 51ff. 2 Ibid. THE EPISTEMIC ROLE OF QUALITAVE CONTENT 383</page><page sequence="2">knowledge of qualitative content affects our understanding of mental terms, I will argue, it does play an epistemically significant role in limiting belief. I. The most well-known attack on the epistemic role of qualitative content comes from Wilfred Sellars. In "The Myth of the Given," Sellars tells us that "There is no reason to suppose that having the sensation of a red trian- gle is a cognitive or epistemic fact."3 The reason for this is that "What is known, even in non-inferential knowledge, is facts rather than particulars."4 For Sellars, all knowledge properly so called is propositional, for only facts (true propositions) can serve as the objects of knowledge. Since sensations and emotions are particulars rather than propositions, they cannot be objects of knowledge. Sellars recognizes that in ordinary language, there "is a sense of know in which it is followed by a noun or descriptive phrase which refers to a particular, thus: 'Do you know John?' 'Do you know the President?"'5 but this sense, he claims, is stipulative and metaphorical rather than ordinary and literal.6 Propositions are complex entities which have concepts as constituents. So if all knowledge is propositional, it follows that having knowledge re- quires having concepts. But having concepts requires more than being able to make appropriate responses under appropriate conditions-it requires "knowing that conditions of this sort are appropriate."7 That is, it requires "being in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one says."8 To be able to give reasons for one's beliefs, however, one must be able to speak a language. Thus having a concept requires having a language. For Sellars, then, "there is an important sense in which one has no concept pertaining to the observable properties of physical objects in Space and Time unless one has them all..." So the reason that having a sensation is not a cognitive or epistemic fact is that it does not require the possession of a language. Babes and brutes can have sensations, but since they lack a language, they cannot have knowledge. Moreover, since having a sensation is not an epistemic fact, sense experience cannot be the foundation of our knowledge, for epistemic facts are not re- ducible to non-epistemic ones. 3 Wilfred Sellars, "The Myth of the Given," in Empirical Knowledge, ed. by R.

SCALK JR.</page><page sequence="3">In ethics it is often said that one cannot derive an ought from an is. That is, one cannot reduce moral facts to non-moral ones. To attempt to do so is to commit the "naturalistic fallacy." Sellars claims that what goes for ethics goes for epistemology as well: "Now the idea that epistemic facts can be an- alyzed without remainder-even 'in principle'-into non-epistemic facts, whether phenomenal or behavioral, public or private, with no matter how lavish a sprinkling of subjunctives and hypotheticals is, I believe, a radical mistake-a mistake of a piece with the so-called 'naturalistic fallacy' in ethics."10 Since having conscious experience is not an epistemic fact, it cannot ground our knowledge, for it does not bear the appropriate relation to epistemic facts. In claiming that qualitative content plays an epistemically significant role in limiting belief, I am not claiming that all factual knowledge is re- ducible to it. Rather, I am claiming that our knowledge of the qualitative content of mental terms can affect our understanding of them. Furthermore, in claiming that qualitative content can affect understanding, I am not claiming that the meaning of mental terms is determined solely by their qualitative content. So my position is not the one Sellars is trying to refute. Nevertheless, in order to place Sellars' view in proper perspective, let's ex- amine some of its weaknesses. The notion that having a concept requires having a language is a troubling one, for it seems to make language learning impossible. Children learn to understand and generate an infinite number of sentences after being exposed to only a finite number of them. If the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meaning of its parts, and if the meaning of at least some sentence parts can be grasped independently of the meaning of others, such an ability is un- derstandable. If not, it is nothing less than miraculous. Even Quine, a friend of holism, recognizes that without "observation sentences" whose meaning is determined solely by the non-verbal stimulations with which they are correlated, language learning could not take place." Thus a full-fledged meaning holism of the sort suggested by Sellars seems implausible. Even if Sellars is right that epistemic facts are not reducible to non-epis- temic ones, non-epistemic facts may play an epistemically significant role in limiting belief, for epistemic properties may supervene on non-epistemic ones in the same way that moral and mental properties supervene on non- moral and non-mental ones.'2 Properties of one type supervene on properties of another just in case having one of the latter properties entails having one 10 Ibid., p. 475. " W. V. 0. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1960), p. 42ff. 12 Ernest Sosa, "The Foundations of Foundationalism," Nous, 14 (1980), pp. 547-65. THE EPISTEMIC ROLE OF QUALITATIVE CONTENT 385</page><page sequence="4">of the former."3 In other words, if something has one kind of property in virtue of having another, the former supervenes on the latter. To admit these types of entailments between moral and non-moral properties is not to com- mit the naturalistic fallacy, for, as Van Cleve explains: First, in claiming supervenience one is not claiming that there are two-way entailments between evaluative statements and descriptive statements. For every true evaluative statement there must be a descriptive statement entailing it, but the entailment need not run back in the other direction. Second, the entailments required by supervenience do not have to be put forth as ex- plicating the meanings of value terms. They can be synthetic necessary truths.14 To commit the naturalistic fallacy is to attempt to reduce moral proper- ties to non-moral ones by offering an analysis of the meaning of moral terms. Since the entailments involved in a case of supervenience need not go both ways, they do not necessarily establish a reduction. And since they need not be concerned with the meanings of the terms involved, they are not nec- essarily analytic. So even if there is an analog of the naturalistic fallacy in epistemology, it does not follow that non-epistemic facts do not play an epistemically significant role in limiting belief. Sellars' assumption that all knowledge is propositional and its corollary that having conscious experience is not an epistemic fact are also question- able. For if one has been in a mental state which has qualitative content, one has a knowledge of that qualitative content. If one has been in pain, for ex- ample, one knows what it is to be in pain. This use of the word "knows" is not stipulative or metaphorical; it is ordinary and literal. What needs to be recognized here is that, as Ryle taught us, there are different types of knowl- edge. Ryle argues that propositional knowledge (knowing-that) and per- formative knowledge (knowing-how) belong to logically distinct cate- gories because they are subject to different sorts of qualifications and acces- sible to different sorts of questions' Propositional knowledge is the sort of knowledge that one has when one can truthfully make claims like "I know that snow is white," "I know that 2+2=4" etc. Performative knowl- edge is the sort of knowledge one has when one can truthfully make claims like "I know how to ride a bicycle," "I know how to play the piano," etc. What makes performative knowledge logically distinct from propositional knowledge is that the former is not reducible to the latter. What one knows when one knows how to do something cannot be captured by any set of 13 James Van Cleve provides the following definition: "A-properties supervene on B- properties if and only if: necessarily, for any item x and A-property F. if x has F then there is a B-property G such that (i) x has G. and (ii) necessarily, whatever has G has F." in "Epistemic Supervenience and the Circle of Belief," The Monist, 68 (April 1985), pp. 97- 9&amp; 14 Ibid., p. 98. 15 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (London: William Brendon and Son, 1949), p. 56ff. 386 TtioioREw. sdacK, JR.</page><page sequence="5">propositions, no matter how large. Learning that an activity involves such and such does not necessarily give one the ability to perform that activity. Thus knowing-how is not a species of knowing-that. In addition to knowing-that and knowing-how, there is another type of knowledge-knowing-what or knowledge by acquaintance'6-that is logi- cally distinct from the other two. Knowing-what is experiential knowl- edge; it is the sort of knowledge one has when one can truthfully make claims like "I know what it is to be in pain," "I know what redness is," etc. Knowing what is logically distinct from knowing-that and knowing-how because it is not reducible to either of them. If one has not had the experience in question, no amount of propositional knowledge will give one the knowledge of what it is to have the experience. If one has not tasted choco- late, for example, there is nothing that one can be told that will give one knowledge of what that taste is. Similarly, there is no repertoire of skills that one can acquire that will give one this sort of knowledge. Thus know- ing-what, like knowing-how, must be considered to be a sui generis form of knowledge. It might be objected that knowing-what or knowledge by acquaintance is not really knowledge properly so-called, for knowledge by acquaintance is not directed upon propositions; one may have knowledge by acquaintance without being able to speak and thus without having any concepts.'7 But to make such a claim is to beg the question. It assumes that knowing-that is the only type of knowledge deserving of the name. This view, however, is not supported by our ordinary language and it runs counter to a considerable in- tellectual tradition. Consequently, there appears little to recommend it. Rorty, in defense of Sellars, is willing to admit that having conscious ex- perience (knowing-what) is a form of knowledge, but he wants to distin- guish between two senses of "knowing-what:" Children and photoelectric cells both discriminate red objects, but pre-linguistic children are thought to "know what red is" in some sense in which photoelectric cells do not. But how can the child know what pain is if all awareness of anything 'is a linguistic affair?' Here Sellars needs another distinction. This time it is between 'knowing what X is like' and 'knowing what sort of thing an X is.' The latter involves being able to link the concept of Xness up with other concepts in such a way as to be able to justify claims about X's.18 Let's call the first type of knowing-what "experiential knowing-what" or "knowing-what," and the second type of knowing-what "categorical know- ing-what" or "knowing-what2." According to Rorty, knowing-what, is 16 Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy (London: Oxford University Press, 1912), p.46 17 Bruce Aune, Knowledge, Mind, and Nature (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 82. 18 Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), p. 183. TIE EPISTEMIC ROLE OF QUALITATV CONTENT 387</page><page sequence="6">epistemically insignificant, for it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient con- dition for knowing-what2. There is no reason for Sellars to object to the notion of 'knowing what pain (or redness) is like,' for this would only support the Myth of the Given, and contradict psychological nomi- nalism, if there were some connection between knowing what pain feels like and knowing what sort of thing pain is. But the only connection is that the fonner is an insufficient and unneces- sary causal condition for the latter. It is insufficient for the obvious mason that we can know what redness is like without knowing that it is different from blue, that it is a color, and so on. It is unnecessary because we can know all that, and a great deal more, about redness while having been blind from birth, and thus not knowing what redness is like. It is just false that we cannot talk and know about what we do not have raw feels of, and equally false that if we cannot talk about them we may nevertheless have justified true beliefs about them.19 What I intend to show is that even if knowing-what, is not a necessary condi- tion for knowing-what, that is, even if having a knowledge of what redness is like is not necessary for having a knowledge of what sort of thing redness is, nevertheless it is necessary for having a complete knowledge of what sort of thing redness is. II. To see this, consider a red-colorblind person. Without ever having experi- enced redness, she could know that red is a color, that it is different from blue, that it is the color of certain ripe apples, etc. As a result, she could use the term "red" in much the same way that a person with normal vision does. But there is at least one thing she would not know, viz., the qualitative con- tent of red sensations. Consequently, there would be times when her use of the term would diverge from that of a normal person, for there are situa- tions where a knowledge of that qualitative content is required to apply the term "red" correctly-in the opthamologist's office, for example, during a test for red-colorblindness. A red-colorblind person cannot use the term "red" as well as a normal person, for she cannot apply it correctly in as many situations. A good indicator of one's understanding of a term is one's ability to use it, for, normally, the better able one is to use a term, the better understand- ing one has of it.20 To know how to use a sortal term is to know under what conditions one is justified in applying it to something. If one has a better knowledge of those conditions than another, i.e., if one can apply it correctly in more situations than another, then there is good reason to believe that one has a better understanding of it. Since a normal person can correctly apply 19 Ibid., pp. 184-85. 20 An "indicator? of something, x, as I am using the term, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for x. Rather it is a condition that is empirically correlated with x such that its presence provides good evidence for the presence of x. 388 THEDOREW. sCaC JR.</page><page sequence="7">the term "red" in more situations that a red-colorblind person, there is good reason to believe that such a one has a better understanding of it. An educated red-colorblind person can certainly have an understanding of the word "red." But it is reasonable to believe that she cannot understand it as well as a normal person, for she cannot use it as well. So even if knowing what redness is like is not a necessary condition for having an understanding of the word "red," it would seem to be a necessary condition for having a complete understanding of it. In claiming that one's ability to use a term is a good indicator of one's understanding of it, I am not claiming that there is a necessary connection be- tween one's ability to use a term and one's understanding of it. For it is con- ceivable that one may become more adept at applying a term without thereby gaining a better understanding of it (see below). My claim is simply that al- though one's understanding of a term need not vary directly with one's abil- ity to apply it, it nevertheless often does. As a result, one's ability to apply a term correctly is a good indicator of one's understanding of it. Understanding is an epistemic notion, for it is a condition of knowl- edge.21 Moreover, understanding admits of degrees. Since knowing-what, can affect our understanding of certain terms, i.e., since it can affect the judg- ments we make with them, it too must be considered to be an epistemic no- tion. Consequently, qualitative content can play an epistemically significant role in limiting belief. III. Although knowing how to use a term is a good indicator of understanding, it is not a good analysis of it. For knowing how to use a term is neither a neces- sary nor a sufficient condition for understanding it. It is not necessary, for one could know the meaning of a term and yet not know how to use it. For example, one could know that "ultus" means revenge in Latin and yet not know how or when to use it.22 It is not sufficient, for one could know how to use a term and yet not know what it means. For example, one could know how to use "amen" or the sign "Q.E.D." and yet not know their meanings.23 To understand a term, I suggest, is not simply to know how to use it. Rather it is to know why the term is used as it is. This view avoids the prob- lems outlined above. On this view, someone who could not speak Latin could still know what "ultus" means provided that she knew that "ultus" plays the same role in Latin that "revenge" plays in English. Conversely, someone 21 Daniel Dennett, Content and Consciousness (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), p. 183. 22 George Pitcher, The Philosophy of Wiugenstein (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1964), p. 252. 23 Ibid. THE EPISTEMIC ROLE OF QUALITATIVE CONTENT 389</page><page sequence="8">who knew how to use the terms "amen" or "Q.E.D." but did not know what they stood for would not know their meanings, for she would not know why they are used as they are. Because this view accords with these intu- itions, it possesses a prima facie plausibility. Those who hold that qualitative content is irrelevant to meaning and thus to epistemology often do so on the grounds that one can know how to use a term without knowing its qualitative content. As Churchland tells us: It has been argued that someone who has never been in pain (because of some fault in his nervous system) could still know the meaning of the word "pain" and use it in conversation, explana- tion, and prediction, just as we use it in describing others. Granted he would not know what pain feels like, but he could still know all of its causal/relational properties, and hence would know as well as we do what kind of state pain is. There would be something he did not know, but it is not clear that the something is the meaning of the word "pain."24 While I agree that one who has not felt pain can have an understanding of the word "pain," I do not believe that she can understand it as well as one who has. Churchland is wrong in claiming that one could have a knowledge of all of the causal/relational properties of pain without having a knowledge of its qualitative content. For there is at least one type of causal relation that such a one could not know, viz., that certain events normally cause certain types of sensations, where the type is determined by qualitative content, A "pain- blind" person, for example, could not know that sticking one's hand in a fire normally causes one to have a sensation like this, where "this" refers to the qualitative content normally experienced as the result of a burn. Contrary to what Churchland would have us believe, then, what the "pain-blind" per- son could not know is a causal/relational property of pain. It is also, I intend to argue, part of the meaning of the word "pain." The argument Churchland presents is this: 1. To know the meaning of a word is to know how to use it in conversation, explana- tion, and prediction. 2 To know how to use it in conversation, explanation, and prediction is to know its causal/relational properties. 3 To know its causal/relational properties one need not know its qualitative con- tent. 4. Therefore to know the meaning of a term one need not know its qualitative con- tent. Premise 2 relies on the assumption that explanation and prediction are de- ductive-nomological. According to the deductive-nomological model, one 4 Paul Churchland, Matter and Consciousness, pp. 125-26. 390 THEODOREw. SCCK, JR.</page><page sequence="9">explains or predicts something by deducing it from a law. Premise 3 asserts that'one can know the laws in which mental terms figure without having a knowledge of their qualitative content. For example, one can know that damage to the body tends to cause pain, that people tend to avoid things that are painful, etc. without having experienced pain. So what is being claimed here is that since explanation and prediction is a matter of deducing some- thing from a law and since one can know the laws of "folk psychology" without having a knowledge of qualitative content, qualitative content is ir- relevant to the explanation and prediction of human behavior. It is doubtful, however, that the explanation and prediction of human be- havior is deductive-nomological. As Putnam says, if a historian reads documents, examines the public actions, reads the diaries and letters, how then does she decide 'Smith was hungry for power'? Not by applying 'general laws of history, sociology, and psychology' to the data as positivist methodologists urge he should! Rather he has to absorb all this material, and then rely on his human wisdom that this shows power- hunger 'beyond a reasonable doubt' (as the courts say). In effect, he uses himself as a 'measuring instrument'; which is pretty much what Weber, Dilthey, etc., urged..."25 According to Putnam, we do not explain or predict others' behavior by de- ducing it from historical, sociological, or psychological laws. Rather we imaginatively project ourselves into other people's situations and consider what we would do if we were them. In other words, we use our selves as an analogue for the selves of others. Such empathic understanding or Verstehen requires a knowledge of qualitative content, i.e., a knowledge of what it is like to have certain sorts of experiences. As Abel explains, "in all its essen- tial features the operation of Verstehen is based upon the application of per- sonal experience to observed behavior. We 'understand' an observed or as- sumed connection if we are able to parallel either one with something we know through self-observation does happen."26 So instead of being periph- eral to our understanding of others, our knowledge of qualitative content would appear to be central. Its role in limiting belief is epistemically significant because it helps shape our explanations and predictions of human behavior. But even if the explanation and prediction of others' behavior were de- ductive-nomological, a person with a knowledge of the qualitative content of mental terms would have a better understanding of them than one who did not, for she would have a better understanding of why they are used as they are. One may be said to have an understanding of a phenomena if one can 25 Hilary Putnam, Meaning and the Moral Sciences (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978), p. 73. 26 Theodore Abel, "The Operation Called Verstehen," in Readings in the Philosophy of Science, ed. by H. Feigl and M. Brodbeck (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1953), p. 684. TI11 EPISTEMIC ROLE OF QUALITATIVE CONTENT 391</page><page sequence="10">deduce it from a law. But if one does not understand why the law holds, one cannot be said to have a complete understanding of it. I submit that without a knowledge of qualitative content, one cannot know why the laws of "folk psychology" are true and hence cannot know why mental terms are used as they are. To take a specific example, suppose that someone explained why another pulled her hand away from a fire by asserting that people tend to avoid things that are painful and that fire is painful. To have a complete under- standing of this phenomena, we would want to know why people tend to avoid things that are painful. For someone who has felt pain, the answer is self-evident-because they are painful! For someone who has not felt pain, however, I do not think a satisfactory answer can be given. For she would not know what it is about pain that makes people want to avoid it. Because she would not know why people tend to avoid things that are painful, she would not know why the word "pain" is used as it is. Consequently, her un- derstanding of the word "pain" would not be as good as one who had experi- enced pain. Thus, without a knowledge of qualitative content, one would not be able to understand certain aspects of the literal use of words. But just as impor- tant, without a knowledge of qualitative content, one would not be able to understand certain aspects of the metaphorical use of words. To see this, let's consider an example from Nelson Goodman. Before me is a picture of trees and cliffs by the sea, painted in dull grays, and expressing great sadness...The picture is literally gray but only metaphorically sad.. .But to say that it is sad is metaphorically true even though literally false. Just as the picture clearly belongs under the label "gray" than under the label "yellow," it also clearly belongs under "sad" than under gray. 2 Without a knowledge of what it is like to be sad, I believe, one would not know why the statement "This painting is sad" is metaphorically true. For without such knowledge, one would be blind to those features of sadness which allow such metaphorical predications to truthfully be made. The metaphorical application of terms is not a deductive-nomological af- fair. We do not arrive at metaphorical truths by deducing them from rules of usage. (In fact, making metaphors involves breaking such rules.) Rather, metaphors are arrived at analogically. We recognize a similarity between two sets of objects by attributing a property which normally applies only to one to the other. In the case of anthropomorphic metaphors like Good- man's, knowing what it's like to have the property in question is essential to 27 Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1976), pp. 50,68,70. 392 THEODOREW. SCHiCK JR.</page><page sequence="11">understanding them. Without a knowledge of qualitative content, one would not be able to recognize the appropriateness of the attribution. It might be thought that the inability to understand metaphor is not a very serious cognitive defect. Such a view, however, would be mistaken, for as Goodman indicates: Metaphor permeates all discourse, ordinary and special, and we should have a hard time finding a purely literal paragraph anywhere. In that last prosaic enough sentence, I count five sure or possible-even if tired-metaphors. This incessant use of metaphor springs not merely from love of literary color but also from urgent need of economy. If we could not readily transfer schemata to make new sortings and orderings, we should have to burden ourselves with unman- ageably many different schemata, either by adoption of a vast vocabulary of elementary terms or by prodigious elaboration of composite ones.8 The use of metaphor, then, rather than being rare, is pervasive. Consequently, a complete understanding of language requires a complete understanding of metaphor. The fact that a knowledge of qualitative content is essential to a complete understanding of metaphor is further evidence of its epistemic significance. The epistemic role of a thing has traditionally been tied to its semantic role. The British empiricists claimed that qualitative content is the founda- tion of our knowledge because it is part of the meaning of mental terms. For them, one cannot know what a mental term means unless one knows what it is like to be in the state associated with that term. Sellars, Rorty, and Churchland claim that qualitative content is irrelevant to our knowledge because it is not part of the meaning of our mental terms. For them, one can know what a mental term means without knowing what it is like to be in the state associated with that term. I have tried to argue that the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes, for understanding admits of de- grees. One can understand a mental term without knowing its qualitative content, but one cannot understand it completely without such knowledge, for without it, not only can one not use such terms correctly in all situa- tions, but one cannot know why they are used as they are.29 28 Ibid., p. 80. 29 I wish to thank Lud Schlecht and Andrew Chrucky for their helpful comments and criti- cisms on earlier drafts.
