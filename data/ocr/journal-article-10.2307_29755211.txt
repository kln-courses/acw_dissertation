<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta, a Chalcolithic Settlement in the Iranian Sistan During the 3rd miHennium, the gradual increase in economic production, population pressure and the selection of cultural characteristics led to the gradual transformation of the first agricultural communities in the urban centres of western Central Asia. The process of human urbanization has been characterized ever since its most ancient phases, and to an exceptional degree, by economic and ideological enrichment, social differen? tiation and concentration of power. Many scholars, among them Frankfort and Childe (*), have by now identified southern Mesopotamia in the 4th and 3rd millennium (Uruk and Jemdet Nasr phases) as the main area of elaboration, and perhaps invention, of most of the cultural elements and technical means that made urban development possible. The problem of the spread of these elements to far distant regions is necessarily linked to this theory, which has been largely confirmed by the results of many excavation campaigns. As regards their diffusion in the easternmost regions of B?l?chist?n and the Indian subcontinent, the basic problem is that of the origin of the Indus Civilization, whose beginnings are still partly obscure, but should almost cer? tainly be related to Mesopotamian influences. Once the principle of cultural diffusion is accepted, the main task is to discern the possible paths through which the first impulses of civilization spread abroad, reaching B?l?chist?n and the surrounding regions. In historical times, the main route for trade and invasion between Mesopotamia and northwestern India was the one which crossed the northern plateau, linking the Khyber Pass, the Valley of Kabul, Qandah?r, Herat, Khorassan, Rayy and beyond, joining the one later known as the ? Silk Road ?, which descended from Samarkand and Marv to arrive at Baghdad and Aleppo. This route is documented by archaeological discoveries and written documents, but only after the 3rd cent. A.D. The sea route between the two regions, which had been mentioned in Arab documents from the 9th and 10th cent., has recently been reconstructed by the successful research of Danish archaeologists in the Persian Gulf. This Preliminary (*) H. Frankfort, The Birth of Civilization in the Ancient East, London, 1954, with preceding references; V. G. Childe, New Light on the Most Ancient East, London, 1954, chap. VI, VII, pp. 102-171. 9</page><page sequence="2">research has by now definitely established the fact that this route was used as far back as the 3rd millennium for trade between the Indus and Mesopotamia, and undoubtedly in? volved the Qatar peninsula and the islands of Bahrein (Dilm?n) and Failaka (2). It must have been practically useless for the limited transfers of the pre-urban communities, but highly important when the amount of trade between the two centres had increased to the point of justifying the risks of a dangerous voyage. It should therefore be presumed that prehistoric communication took place above all through the Iranian plateau. Another possible route that may have linked the Indus plain directly with Qandah?r through the Bolan and Gomel districts in northern B?l?chist?n is documented for us by Alexander's biographers, Iranian sources and the archaeological remains themselves. The latter seem to partly confirm this, in regard to the period before the 1st. millennium B.C. as well The distribution along all this route, of many proto-urban centres that can be con? nected culturally, in the valleys of Loralai, Zhob, Quetta and Qandah?r {Mundigak IV, urban center), is in fact evident proof of the existence of such a way of communication. Anyone going west from the Qandah?r plain had the following alternative: going northwest along the Herat, one reached the centres of present-day Soviet Turkestan ? Anau and Namazga Tepe ? and those at the foot of the Elburz Mountains ? Tepe Hissar and Chasman Ali ? while to the southwest, following the valley of the Hilmand River, one arrived in Sist?n across the Margo and Registan deserts. Any reconstruction of communications between prehistoric Sist?n and western Ir?n is made more difficult by the state of almost complete abandonment in which that route was left in epochs closer to our own. Then too, the slight archaeological exploration of this region makes the task even harder. However, the great centres of F?rs and Elam could only have been reached by the present territory of Kirm?n; the discovery of an exceptionally large chalcolithic village at Tal-i Iblis seems to confirm this hypothesis (3). But Sist?n must have been linked to the peoples situated to the south along the Bam pur Valley, where another route passed, arriving at Sindh after crossing central B?l?chist?n and the Dasht Valley in Makr?n. This is the famous Gedrosia road, mentioned by classical historiography as the way Alexander returned from India. This premise alone justifies the interest aroused by the research on prehistoric Sist?n sponsored by the Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici of the Istkuto per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente (IsMEO); the aim of this research is the study of the formation of the most ancient human communities in a region of such great historical importance, so as to throw light on Slst?n's role, during the 4th and 3rd millennium, in the network of relations involving the regions between Syria and the Indus Valley.

Tal-i Iblis ?, Illinois State Museum Preliminary Report, 7, Springfield (111.), 1967. 10</page><page sequence="3">GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING Geographically speaking, Sist?n is simply the delta of the Hilmand, one of Asia's largest rivers, and one that for millennia has given life to a region surrounded by mountains and deserts, thanks to its annual flow of several thousand cubic meters. The river is the result of a complex system of waters originated by the conjunction of all the temporary and permanent streams descending from the southwestern slopes of the Afghan mountains. This large and constant supply of water lets the Hilmand keep a regular course even through the Registan desert, and reach the H?m?n basin. Here, due to the orographic and geological nature of the soil, and the minor quantity of water, the Hilmand forms a very wide delta of 270,000 sq. km., and divides into three main courses: the R?d-i Sist?n, the R?d-i Hil? mand and the R?d-i Parian; their flow regulates the entire hydrological system of the entire basin of the H?m?n-i Hilmand, whose 350,000 sq. km. represents one of southern Central Asia's most important internal basins (Fig. 1). The basin is oval in shape and stretches out in a NE-SW direction, reaching its major height above sea-level in the extreme northeast, where it is a continuation of the southwestern Hind?kush and touches the 5,000 m. level. Its lowest part lies in the southwest, in Gaud-i Zira, at 470 m. above sea-level. Another three streams, really torrents, complete the hydro logical picture of the region; they are the Harut R?d, the Farah R?d and the Khash R?d, which flow respectively towards northwest, northeast and east-northeast. These are only in function during the spring months, from February to May. The basin, which is geographically part of the Iranian plateau, is politically divided: Afghanistan occupies the largest part, Pakistan owns a small section and only 36,000 sq.km. fall in Iranian territory. The latter is the area furthest to the west, the H?m?n-i Hilmand itself, while the basin of the H?m?n-i Purak to the northeast and the vast depression of the Gaud-i Zira to the southeast remain in Afghan territory. This huge territory is about 600 km. from the Gulf of Om?n, has an average altitude of 500 m. and is oriented towards southwest. Sist?n, like all the southeastern territories of Ir?n, is well-linked with the two bordering nations, Afgh?nist?n and Pakistan. This is also clear from the fact that the road system and the valley-stream system itself tie the region in more with traffic from the east than from the west. Even today southeastern Ir?n is considered isolated from the rest of the country because of its natural geography; and in fact, the Dasht-i L?t depression, the Kirm?n moun? tain chain and the great distances make communication with Ir?n's dynamic centres dif? ficult. When we come to examine the relationships between the proto-urban communities of Sist?n and its neighbours, in the 3rd millennium, we shall have to reconstruct a geopolitical situation almost exactly like the geographical one. The level of the lakes into which the different branches of the delta flow, varies consi? derably during the year and from one year to the next; this makes the community's daily 11</page><page sequence="4">life extremely precarious. The lack of balance in the hydrological system causes a steady lack of equilibrium in the Sist?n economy, since the unpredictable variations do not allow a plan? ned and permanent canal system to be built. Where the ground-level or the distance from the branches of the delta impede the canal waters from arriving, the amount of salinity in the ground prevents any type of vegetation. The decline of the flora lays the area open to the wind, which blows mainly from the north and northwest. The lack of obstacles increases its velocity to a very high point; this causes, on the one hand, constant erosion of the ground prominences and the villages made of unbaked clay, and on the other, forms, in certain areas, sand dunes which only increase the lack of vegetation. These conditions are undoubtedly favoured by the geological nature of Sist?n. It is in fact merely a land-locked basin formed by a deep stratigraphical series of compact sand? stones and clays, in flysh formation, and with intercanalizations of nummulitic limestone, that resolve themselves tectonically in a series of anticlines and corrugations, with an occa? sional nucleus of cretaceous limestone. All these formations are basically impermeable, ex? cept for the limestone intercanalizations. The ground, by preventing the absorption of drainage water, thus favours the formation of lake basins that are rather boggy and have a high rate of evaporation. We can give the following definitive description of present-day Sist?n: a pre-desert steppe area characterized by persistent wind action and by an unstable hydrological system. * * * We must now analyze what the ecological conditions may have been four thousand years ago. Even if we still do not have an analysis of the pollen accumulation on stratigraphies that can be given absolute chronological dating, it is easy to assume that those conditions must have been far different from the ones that prevail today. In the last 600 years, all of western Central Asia has undergone an economic and political decline that has turned into an ecological crisis. For Sist?n in particular, the Iranian and Islamic sources earlier than Tamerlane's last disastrous raid in 1387 have handed down to us descriptions of a fertile land with rich inhabitants. It is probable that such conditions also existed before that time. Then too, the distribution and size of the most important prehistoric centres discovered in the region can only be explained in terms of far different habitat conditions. The hydrological geography of Sist?n was certainly different from that of our day. The R?d-i Biy?b?n (4), today completely dry, must have been one of the most important branches (4) W. A. Fairservis, Jr, ?Archaeological Studies in the Seistan Basin of South Western Afghanistan and Eastern Iran?, Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History, 48, 1961, pp. 1-128 (see, in detail, p. 20). 12</page><page sequence="5">of the prehistoric delta. This is shown not only by the topographical evidence but also by the very distribution of most of the prehistoric centres located (fig. 2). In fact, most of them are concentrated along the R?d-i Biy?b?n or in the area between the latter and the southern arms of the H?m?n-i Hilmand. Perhaps because of the water supplied by now-dry R?d-i Biy?b?n, the Hilmand must have extended much further south, touching the nucleus of inhabited settlements localized by Stein near Ram R?d, and the large tell of Shahr-i Sokhta. Among other things, the future research of the Missione Archeologica Italiana will concentrate on the hydrographic study of the region. Therefore, these notes represent a short introduction to the problem of the first human settlements, and are preliminary to a detailed examination of the mechanism of these ecological changes. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL EXAMINATION For a long time archaeological research in Sist?n was extremely limited and considered complementary to other efforts, since the region was thought of as peripheral in regard to contemporary Western and Eastern centres. When the Centro Studi e Scavi in Asia set up the Missione Archeologica Italiana in Ir?n in 1960, exploration of Sist?n was finally begun with a long-term plan and an over-all methodology devoted to historical and prehistorical excavations. The aim was to reconstruct all the different phases in the history of a territory that seems to have played a very important role in southern Central Asia. Sir Aurel Stein, that untiring traveller in Central Asia, had visited Sist?n in 1916, mak? ing use of the precious information collected in the early years of the century by G. P. T?te, at that time Superintendent of the commission set up to determine the borders between Ir?n and Afgh?nist?n (5). Stein never gave a precise nature to his archaeological research, but tended to collect all the data offered by a specific region. Even if this method did not allow him to deepen his knowledge of specific subjects, it still served to supply us with an enormous number of detailed observations that even today have still not been totally used by scholars. As regards prehistoric Sist?n, we owe to Stein the discovery of a series of sites gathered around Ram R?d, near the ancient bed of the R?d-i Biy?b?n, the dry branch of the Hilmand, and that of the most surprising prehistoric site of all the zones: Shahr-i Sokhta.

Andrews, have hitherto represented the only publications available for comparing the production of these centres and that of the neighbouring regions. After Stein, Iranian Sist?n was given a very limited visit by E. Herzfeld (6), who merely used his observations in regard to the literary sources. In fact, his main study on Sist?n (7) is based not so much on considerations of a topographical and archaeological nature as on a critical examination of those passages in classical and Zoroastrian texts that mention this region. Even if his approach has by now become outdated (8), it still represents a valua? ble effort at the interpretation and topographical verification of the sources. However, these results have been more useful for the religious history of pre-Islamic Ir?n than for that of the older Sist?n. In the years before the Second World War, the Delegation Archeologique Fran$aise en Afghanistan carried out some systematic research in the Afghan districts of Sist?n; this cul? minated in a brief excavation campaign directed by R. Ghirshman, on N?d cAli, a tepe complex located about 20 km. southeast of Chakansur (9). The results of this brief exploration were highly interesting, because they led to the discovery of two distinct cultural phases: the lower one contained gray pottery that can be linked, in form and colour, to the types of Hissar III and Sialk VI B, while the one that followed was classified as proto-Achaemenian by Ghirshman, on the basis of some significant discoveries: bronze, three-flanged arrowpoints and palmette-like ornaments, gray ceramics, painted bricks and ornaments for horse harnesses. A clear stratigraphic interruption was not noticed, and even the material found leads one to assume a long and continuous frequentation of the site during the 2nd millennium B.C. and after. For more than 20 years the excavation at N?d cAli was the only one to which scholars could refer. But the decentralization of the tepe in regard to the basin, its rather restricted chronological cultural succession and the limited exploration of the site, prevented a thorough picture of prehistoric Sist?n from being traced. In 1951, W. Fairservis carried out a brief survey in the Afghan part (10). His main con? tribution was undoubtedly the discovery of a number of historical and prehistoric sites along the R?d-i Biy?b?n and the southern part of the basin. His study really represents the first total examination of Sist?n as an archaeological area, and contains some extremely valuable observations. (6) E. Herzfeld, ?

In 1960 the Missione Archeologica Italiana in Ir?n, directed by Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, began to explore the entire region for research purposes. During a vast preliminary survey, Prof. U. Scerrato rediscovered the sites first localized by Stein Initially the main impulse was given to excavation and research relative to the Achae menian and Parthian periods, still obscure in all of eastern Ir?n; then, in 1967, the Centro Scavi decided to undertake the systematic exploration of prehistoric Sist?n, entrusting the task to the present writer. Obviously, the research began at the site which ? because of the surface discoveries and its imposing size ? is of exceptional importance for prehistoric research in the Sist?n region: Shahr-i Sokhta. DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE Shahr-i Sokhta is a tepe about 20 m. high; it rises on a flat clayey plain, which may be one of the oldest southern extensions of the H?m?n, when the Sana R?d or the R?d-i Biy?b?n were still active. The hill is shaped like a tongue of earth that stretches for about half a mile along a north-south axis. It is about 40 miles south of Z?bul, the present admi? nistrative centre of Iranian Sist?n, and stands on the edge of the road to Z?hid?n (12). The tepe has rather irregular outlines, because of the action of various agents, among them, naturally, the northwest wind, which has progressively flattened the top and rounded all the corners (fig. 8). One can also recognize the action of another agent at Shahr-i Sokhta: water. The sides of the hill show quite a few deep splits that sometimes stem out from the middle sections. The shape and winding path of these splits show clearly that they have been formed by erosion. By now they have become real little gullies (fig. 31). The entire surface of this small hill ? and most of the plain around it ? is covered with gravel and other river-deposits; their distribution reproduces the flow of the old flood currents, rains and the backwater pools. i11) U.

The name is probably fairly recent and might derive from the reddish colour of the surface of the ground, due to strong oxida? tion. It is not likely that some memory of an ancient catastrophe has been preserved in the zone of the tell. More probably, the name was given to the area not too long ago, under the suggestion of the oxidation of the ground, along with the evident traces of human occupation: remains of buildings and a great number of archaeological remains scattered on the surface. 15</page><page sequence="8">The combined action of wind, erosion and temperature changes have caused one of Shahr-i Sokhta's most evident characteristics: the entire surface of the tepe is covered with terracotta vases, intact and in pieces, stone and bronze objects, alabaster containers and seals, to an astonishing degree. It is practically impossible to walk anywhere on the site without trampling on the layer of ceramics that covers it. Stein believed that this phenomenon was due to wind erosion, which had progressively carried off every bit of transportable material from the deposit, leaving the ceramics and other heavier objects. Its action, combined with that of water, had supposedly wiped out the structures of unbaked clay; and rain-erosion had carried off the pottery, whase pieces were piled up all over the sides of the erosion gullies. It thus seemed that conditions for a stra tigraphical excavation did not exist at Shahr-i Sokhta, since most of the deposit itself had been lost. But Stein soon defined it as a great deposit of prehistoric pottery; this was confirmed by a short trial dig about 40 cm. deep. Compact sterile clay had already appeared after a stratum of disintegrated clay about 30 cm. thick, rich in animal bones. Fairservis did not get a chance to visit the area during his survey, and followed Stein's data unquestioningly, defining the site as a clay mesa. In summary, up to today Shahr-i Sokhta has generally been considered a hill settle? ment, which disappeared as a result of the destructive action of wind, water and passing flocks of sheep. * * * Our first impression was exactly like that of Stein: the thickness of the layer of sherds that covered the hill could leave little room for doubt. But even if the wind might have carried off and destroyed most of the ancient settle? ment, it might also have preserved part of the site by accumulation. The ? soft stratum of loose disintegrated clay ? (13) found by Stein was struck everywhere below the pottery frag? ments. This clay was partly produced by the dissolution of structures of unbaked clay bricks, and partly by erosion. However, these strata also contained much dust, evidently wind-borne. The result was a covering of sherds, dissolved clay and wind-dust that might easily have acted as protection for the deposit and the underlying structures. And we could distinguish these structures even before starting to excavate. The progres? sive aridity of Sist?n in the last centuries has, as we mentioned earlier, greatly increased the salinity of the ground. The absorption rate of the earth varies according to its nature: it is higher in mixtures of clay and dust, and very low in the compact clay of the crude bricks. This phenomenon causes a slight difference in the colour of the ground, making the walls almost whitish in colour because of the salt deposited on them; at certain times of the day, an atten (13) Stein, op. cit., II, p. 954. 16</page><page sequence="9">tive observer can reconstruct the plan of the buried buildings (14). Later, a few hours of rain let us make out large portions of the urban plan with surprising clarity (fig. 30). After an accurate survey of the entire surface of the tepe, excavation was gotten under way. This consisted of an extensive excavation that let us bring to light as much as pos? sible of the city walls, and one in depth for stratigraphy. We chose a section of ground that had not been too disturbed by rainwater erosion, in the centre of the hill; in this fairly flat area, we dug a rectangular trench 40 m. long and 10 m. wide, with a nortbnsouth axis. The surface of the excavation was subdivided into four sectors 10 X 10 m., given the letters C, D, E and F from south to north; a bulk of 1 m. was left between each sector, which was in turn subdivided into 4 squares 4 X 4 m. each. These were numbered clockwise, starting with the northwestern one, and with accom? panying arabic index-numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4. We were also interested in finding out if the slight differences in relief present all over the tepe's surface represented the buried remains of better-preserved or more recent struc? tures in the stratigraphical succession, or whether they were merely piles of rubble formed through natural causes; a logical perplexity on a site where the violence of erosion increases the archaeologist's hardships. At a point to the southeast in regard to the main axis, we chose an elevation of about 1 m. above one of the erosion gullies, about 200 m. to the south of sectors C-F. Here we excavated another sector 10 X 10 m., indicated by the letter B, divided into two parts: IB that to the south, 2B that to the north; here we made a depth excavation. The Mission had as its members, apart from the writer, Miss F. Bonardi, photogra? pher, Mr. G. Graziani, Assistant, and Mr. R. Zahedani, of the Iranian National Archaeolog? ical Service, who collaborated directly in the systematization of a large part of the ceramics. THE EXTENSIVE EXCAVATION (Sectors C-F) The excavation of twelve of the fourteen squares of sectors C-F let us bring to light a whole series of walls of unbaked clay (fig. 3). These structures lay immediately below surface stratum 1 of dissolved clay, mixed with wind-borne dust and sand, and with an average thickness of 20 to 40 cm. Below this surface stratum, underlying stratum 2 is characterized by the collapsed structures, and is (14) This phenomenon had already been ob? served by. U. Scerrato during a preliminary survey at Dahan-i Ghulaman; conditions were such that his draftsmen were able to trace out a map of the Achaemenian buildings buried there, even before excavation was begun. See, U. Scerrato, 1962, cit., p. 190. 17</page><page sequence="10">thus called ? destruction stratum ?. Both 1 and 2 contain many fragments of wood-coal, often quite large. These are probably burnt remains of ancient wooden structures. It may well be that the fire that burned most of these wooden structures partially helped to pre? serve the walls and bricks, by scorching their surface. This was clearly evident in rooms If and 2c. Often, however, the disintegrating action of water has decomposed the clay, mixing the bricks together in an almost compact clay mass. After removing the collapsed material and the mantle of broken pottery, the lower levels were brought to light; by the end of the excavation campaign, we were able to recon? struct quite distinctly the partial plans of at least three buildings, all oriented in a NE-SW direction. These are numbered 1, 2 and 3 respectively, from south to north. The part of building 1 brought to light lies almost wholly in squares G and G. A small part of it continues into the area still not uncovered to the south and east. There traces of its walls can be noted at certain hours of the day, on the surface of the ground; we have tried to reproduce them in the building-plan, so as to make the total picture more complete. Building l's plan seems to be a network of walls that meet orthogonally at regular distances, so as to form a series of square rooms whose sides vary from 1.80 to 2.20 m. The rooms excavated and those merely delineated are lined up in two adjoining rows; there are seven in all. The over-all measurements of the building are: 11m. long by 7.5 m. vide. The inner walls have an average thickness of 0.60 m., and are made of two adjoining rows of bricks laid horizontally with the long side out, and the joints either corresponding vertically or slightly out of line. The outer walls are thicker, reaching 1 m. in thickness, because they are laid with three adjoining rows of bricks. All the walls merely abut on one another, and are never perfectly straight-joined at their meeting-points. The brick measurements are constant: length 40 cm., width 20 cm., height 10 cm.; all are held together by a mortar made of clay mixed with sand. Only the lower part of the walls has remained intact, with the result that much of the floor levels has also been lost. The lack of doors in the walls brought to light supports the hypothesis that here we are almost at the level of the foundations. Each room in this building, as in the others, held an exceptional number of intact and broken ceramic containers, mixed in with other material and pieces of broken brick. The structures brought to light in squares G and C4, adjacent to the ? outer ? walls of building 1, probably belonged to two other buildings. The wall in G, made of bricks placed vertically with the long side out, contains, in what must have been its inner room, many terracot ta recipients broken in loco and obviously burned. Unfortunately, just beyond the corner of square G there is an erosion gully into which all the rest of the building that held this small wall has been washed. Part of a building in G has been temporarily ignored because of its bad state of preservation. Building 2 is close to building 1 on the north side and is lined up with it; the east walls have not yet been uncovered. There is a space of about 2.50 m. between the two 18</page><page sequence="11">buildings. It too is filled with pieces of brick and other rubble from the collapsed struc? tures, thus suggesting that a small road passed between the two buildings at that point. This hypothesis has still not been definitively confirmed by the stratigraphical evidence, but seems justified by the fact that buildings 1 and 2 each have their own distinct characteristics, which appear to exclude any structural continuity. The plan of building 2 has been delimited in Di, D2, Da and EU, while its outline can still be clearly traced for several meters immediately east of the excavated area. In this case too the floor-plan is a simple one, formed by the orthogonal crossing of smaller walls (of two adjoining rows of bricks placed horizontally with the long side out) all contained within a perimetral wall 1.20 m. thick (of three/four adjoining rows of bricks placed horizontally with the long side out). This building is thus similar to the preceding one, in planimetry, structure and NE-SW orientation. The building's measurements are: 11 m. wide by 15 m. long (fig. 3). Squares D4 and E4 have not been excavated because erosion has destroyed the deposit containing the structures which interest us there. As a result, the west side of the plan has been reconstructed on the basis of a thick wall found in square Di, oriented in the same direction as those of squares D2, Da and Ea. Four distinct rooms have been wholly or partially excavated in this building, while others have simply been located on the basis of the traces visible on the ground nearby. Each room contained many vases, intact or clearly broken in loco. We should like to point out two aspects of the position in which these broken ceramics were found. The surface stratum of wind-dust and disintegrated clay bricks 1 contains, as we have already pointed out, many sherds. When this layer is eliminated and collapse stratum 2 is reached, one finds that the fragments tend to diminish, to suddenly increase when floor-level or the level of the base of the walls 3 is arrived at. In this stratum one notices that, even though erosion has acted on these fragments too, those relative to the same pot are spread over a very small area, and seem to have been broken at that point. A vase is often found lying broken beneath the bricks that destroyed it, its basic shape still preserved. The plan of the room in Da (fig. 3) documents this situation perfectly: one should particularly note that the large jar indicated by the arrow is still beneath the brick that broke it, while it in turn crushes other smaller vessels. The plate that follows shows a similar situation in room 2c: a large jar lies broken on the floor of the room, covered by the collapse of the big wall at the end (fig. 35). It is clear that, while the very rich surface stratum contains the remains of a deposit destroyed by the wind and eroded by water, the stratum below it might document the destruction and, in some cases, the frequentation of the houses. The plan of building 2 offers some noteworthy characteristics. Above all, the rooms preserve their domestic hearths. The first of these, in room 2c, has the appearance of a small clay bench with traces of burning inside; overturned beside it is an undecorated ceramic bowl that contains burnt wood. This might easily be a casual hearth, later than the 19</page><page sequence="12">destruction of the building. The hearth in room X is far more interesting and significant. It is a square formed by four small walls of clay, 50 cm. long and about 20 cm. thick. It rests on one of the cross-walls, at a point where the wall has badly deteriorated; this hearth should be assigned to a moment when the room was being transformed by the sealing up of a door, and the placing of this hearth on the wall (15). The fire which seems to have partly contributed to the destruction of these structures at Shahr-i Sokhta, has at some points even helped to preserve the wall-plaster. The only example still in loco is on the north wall of room 2c. The heat has consolidated certain sections of it and the collapse of the building has pressed it against the wall, preventing erosion from detaching it completely. It seems to be made of diluted clay paste, highly purified and consolidated by the addition of straw or some other suitable material, and then applied directly to the wet wall. More than one construction phase is probably present. This would explain the disor? derly position of the walls in F2. The room in square F2 is interesting because in it are two small walls, orthogonal to the north-south main wall, and about 1 &gt;m. from one another (room 3b). A cavity in the unbaked clay in an inner corner suggests a support for a large buried jar. It may be that this small room was a closet or a kitchen (fig. 34, foreground). All of this room contained fallen bricks with evident traces of fire, while there were hardly any ceramic fragments. A large number of ceramics, however, partly intact and partly broken in loco, were found in another room, L-shaped in form. In the outer corner of the L there was a ter? racotta vase, buried and completely burned; this in turn contained a very common little biconical vase. The large jar was set into a hole in a pavement of bricks laid with their broad surfaces up, each measuring 38 X 20 X 11 cm. This is the only example of paving found in the entire area under exploration. The pavement could only be identified for a short stretch, since its construction with a single type of block left it open to water-erosion. Squares Fi, Fa and F4 are unfortunately included in a very slight depression that spared the structures, but produced the sliding of the deposits (strata 2 and 3), causing the noted agglomeration of thousands of ceramic fragments in a very small space (fig. 36). The first 40 cm. of this pile in square F4 form a single block of ceramic fragments. Only the room in Fi, between the large north-south wall and the west wall of square, keeps a part (about 1 sq. m.) of the burnt ruins preserved; this was removed a few days before the end of the campaign. It appeared below a totally-burned wooden structure that continued beyond the limits of the excavated zone. This structure consisted of three poles, parallel to one another and orthogonal to the large wall, and with a diameter varying from 2 to 15 cm. Smaller poles were inserted transversally to them, about 4-5 cm. apart, and joined to one another by smaller branches parallel to the main trunks. The use of such a structure can (15) The square shape of this hearth leads us to relate it to other hearths from various Indo Iranian sites, especially from that of Mundigak, in periods II, III and IV, where such types are characteristic of the period we are discussing. 20</page><page sequence="13">only be guessed at: it may be a portion of collapsed roof or a supplementary wall built of wood (fig. 37). The stratigraphical position of the structure ? below a collapsed room consolidated by the heat from a fire ? should guarantee the simultaneity of the burning of the wood and the destruction of the building. On the basis of this evidence, the samples were col? lected with particular care, and consigned to the Geochemical Institute of Rome University, for the radiocarbon test, and to the Botanical Institute of that University, for the analysis of the vegetable species. Not many conclusions can be drawn the walls found in sectors C, D, E, and F. But it can be stated as of now that in this period of its history, Shahr-i Sokhta contained large build? ings, constructed with skilled techniques and perhaps inserted into a planned urban complex. Traces of various transformations are also evident, even if hard to trace because of the mas? sive erosion action. Finally, the elements collected suggest that the structures there must have been destroyed by the violence of a great fire, that may be related to the destruction of the city. THE DEPTH EXCAVATION (Sector B) The two parallel trenches IB and 2B, separated from one another by a bulk 1 m. wide, will let us ascertain the stratigraphical succession of Shahr-i Sokhta. The task is still in its initial phase. In an area no larger than 3 sq. m., we have reached a depth of 3 m. without touching the natural ground-level (fig. 4). TRENCH IB In trench IB, the tops of the walls appeared just below the stratum of wind-dust 1, here too very rich in ceramics. We thus had immediate confirmation of the fact that a good part of the differences in relief met with on the top of the tepe should be attributed to greater or lesser erosion of the structures. The curving profile of the mound faithfully fol? lowed the line of erosion of the walls themselves (fig. 5). Surface stratum 1, very rich in finds, covered the entire area of the excavation with a coating up to 30 cm. thick (figs. 5, 40) Below this, the excavation has brought to light, up to now, constructions belonging to three phases, numbered progressively from top to bottom, I, II and III. The tremendous erosion and the narrow area excavated unfortunately prevent us from relying too much on the material for distinguishing eventual cultural dif? ferentiations within the range of the stratigraphical ones. A long wall mnning north-south, rather well preserved, and made of a single row of bricks laid horizontally with the long side out, fissures slightly out of line from one 21</page><page sequence="14">layer to the other (measurements of the bricks: about 40 X 20 X 10 cm.), belongs to the upper structures (phase I). Another wall, almost orthogonal to the first and built in the same way, and lastly, two hearths, located on top of one another in the southeast corner of the trench, should probably be assigned to later phases. All four structures have been badly damaged by the sloping of the upper strata of the deposit. The hearths are made of a rather crude paste of clay and straw, and are rather shapeless, even if clearly rectangular; they are merely flat pieces of clay smoothed down with a stick and with a raised edge. Both rest against the wall without being connected to it, and cannot be clearly connected to any level. The small wall, running east-west, does not really touch the transverse wall, but stops about 100 cm. from it; that space is filled with a vertical pile of irregularly-placed bricks and with many highly-compressed sherds. The base of this wall narrows because the bottom row of bricks is laid further in than those above; a sherd filling is inserted under the second row, perhaps so as to guarantee a wider base for supporting the wall (fig. 41). Under a stratigraphical profile, these walls of the later period are contained in two clay strata very rich in broken ceramics, 2 and 3, which are probably still partially in situ, and appear to be more compact than surface stratum 1. Since strata 2 and 3 appear defi? nitively above the top of the walls, they can be assigned to a phase later than the construc? tion of the walls. Their process of deterioration continues today. In trench IB, phase II is represented by die remains of a room which contains noth? ing but a few mutilated pieces of wall, very narrowed down by sliding; as a result, this room can only be hypothetically reconstructed. The structures are contained in a stratum 4 of clayey deposit very rich in ceramic fragments and unbaked objects; this stratum has only been slighdy damaged by sliding. It contains much coal and some lens-shaped hearth remains. The walls of phase II closely resemble those of the buildings extensively excavated in sectors C-F; they are made of bricks laid in two adjoining rows, each measuring approxi? mately 40 X 20 X 10 cm. The depth excavation then continued in a restricted trial dig of 2.50 X 1.50 m. in the northeast corner of the trench, reaching a further depth of 3 m., and bringing to light a series of strata that are rich in material; here too, natural ground level was not reached. This confirms the existence of an extremely thick deposit, at least in this part of the tepe, a possibility excluded by Stein and Fairservis. Continuing the stratigraphical succession, a very compact clayey stratum, almost without ceramics, and about 50 cm. thick, 5, appears at a level now below the wall itself. The ceramics tend to progressively increase below the layer of clay, 6 and 7. Stratum 5, compact and seminsterile, may be the remains of a flood that interrupted a phase of habitation. The levels just below it show the same situation, in an even more concentrated form. There, a thick stratum of sterile clay 8 lies above a thin bed of coals 9, below which appears a stra? tum rich in material 10, with remains of buildings of unbaked brick, large ceramic frag? ments and many bones (phase III).

The alternation of semi-sterile clayey strata and remains of full occupation should not be considered extraordinary in regions subject to a hydrological regime with broad effects, one very difficult to control, as we supposed the Hilmand to be a few millennia ago. The periodic floods forced the inhabitants to constantly rebuild and even move certain urban districts. This phenomenon is therefore very much like that ascertained for the Indus Civiliza? tion, especially at Mohenjo Daro; there eight strata of semi-sterile clay have been distin? guished in the stratigraphical context, alternating with levels and construction stories that can all be inserted into the same cultural context. TRENCH 2B In the easternmost portion of this trench (fig. 6), below the 10-20 cm. of surface stratum 1, there appeared a collapsed structure, very compact, not too worn down by erosion and perhaps consolidated by oxidation 2a. Aligned stretches of the rows of bricks of the walls can be clearly seem among the collapsed bricks. Three sides of the room have survived, while the fourth and westernmost one has been completely carried away by the sliding of the deposit. The walls are built of two adjoining rows of bricks, aligned hori? zontally with the long side out, with the usual approximate measurements of 40 X 20 X 10 cm. There is particular interest in the discovery of a portion of pavement which was broken in several places by the collapsing structures. It is made of a level of compact clay, mixed with a high percentage of rough straw, and is 3 cm. thick; it touches the wall and rests on a stratum of wind-carried dust and sand 3. About 30 cm. below the pavement there are animal bones and a large amount of sheep-dung, mixed with the ashes of large hearths. This might mean that in a phase earlier than the construction of the room, the site was occupied by flocks of sheep 4. The pavement terminates with the slide, which is clearly connected with the nearby trench. Just below it, near the western edge of the trench, two lens-shaped hearth remains were located; these can easily be attributed to a later epoch, since they are stratigraphically above the slopings (fig. 6). The remains of the walls of two superimposed rooms, which may have had a different orientation, appeared near the west side of the trench. They are unfortunately too damaged by surface erosion to be very useful in supplying data (fig. 4). Small stratigraphic pit IB (2.50 X 1.50 m.) let us ascertain the existence of three time phases, which we have temporarily called I, II and III, starting from the bottom. We use the term phases and not periods, because the variability index among the handi 49</page><page sequence="72">crafts brought to light seems to be very low, to the point where we can already state that the 3 m. of deposit found up to now do not represent a very broad span of time. This study of the topography and structures of Shahr-i Sokhta would not be complete if we did not make at least a brief reference to the data furnished by a careful survey of the vast surface of the mound. We have already mentioned the variations in the ground's capacity for absorption; these trace the outlines of those structures closest to the surface. This phenomenon has helped us to distinguish many buildings whose plans are often complex, and often of large size. Fig. 30 shows part of one of these, which Prof. Tucci localized near the western extremity of the tepe. Miss F. Bonarc?, the Mission's photographer, found a very eroded terracotta tube protruding from a narrow erosion gully. When the thin covering of earth was brushed away, a very intact section of the tube appeared {fig. 42). It was evidently part of the urban system, and was formed of terracotta cylinders inserted into one another, each 10 cm. in diameter and about 40 cm. long, oriented on an east-west axis. This is a fairly important discovery. Such systems, on a very large scale, have been brought to light in Sindh, at Mohenjo Daro, at Chanhu Daro and at Kot Diji, in complexes that belong to the Indus Civilization. We cannot at present draw conclusions from this discovery, but we think it of great significance for understanding the level of civilization that must have been attained at a certain moment in the history of Shahr-i Sokhta. FINDS The reports by Stein and Andrews on the ceramics and handicrafts found at Shahr-i Sokhta during the 1916 survey, let the area, or at least a good part of it, be dated to the 3rd millennium (16). Our first campaign has fully confirmed the indications supplied by Stein's reports. Although the examination of the hundreds of ceramic fragments we collected on the surface of the tepe has been extremely superficial up to now, one can say that none of them date from a period later than 1000 B.C. The many researches carried out between Mesopotamia and the Indus, during the fifty years that separate Stein's work at Shahr-i Sokhta from our own, let us localize the site, culturally and chronologically, in a more precise fashion. We feel obliged to state that, in this report, the examination of the material discov? ered will of necessity be merely indicative; most of this material, and especially certain (16) Stein, op. ext., II, III; Andrews, op. cit. 50</page><page sequence="73">groups such as the seals, the stone handicrafts as well as those of alabaster and semi-precious stones, the result of an original production that may have had great economic importance, requires a detailed study for each of its branches. CERAMICS Most of the ceramics come from the levels of destruction and frequentation of the buildings brought to light, especially in sectors C, D, E and F. On the other hand, many of the most significant patterns come from those fragments collected during the surface exploration. Despite the extension of the tepe and the really exceptional number of fragments collected or excavated, the ceramic production of Shahr-i Sokhta seems to be fairly unitary in nature. On the basis of the combinations of background colour and decoration colour, the painted ceramics can be subdivided into: Black-to-brown on surface; Black-on-gray or gray pottery; Black-on-red (17). Very few ceramics with incised or relief decoration were found (only six fragments, all collected on the surface). The black-to-brown on surface pottery is mainly of good quality, turned on a slow wheel and made of a purified paste, yellowish-orange in colour; the pieces are covered with a cream-coloured slip that is very thin, and are painted black or dark brown. The forms are very simple, with almost no trace of handles, spouts, distinct bases, trimming, etc. There are really only three basic forms: flat-bottomed bowls (fig. 7); small jars with conical body, broad rim and base in the shape of a truncated cone (fig. 7); globular jars with ovoid body (figs. 12, 16). Variations of these three forms are few in number and wholly insignificant. This is obviously useful pottery, made to satisfy the needs of daily use. We still cannot exclude the possibility, however, that along with this there existed a more refined production, for special functions, which may eventually come to light. It should be noted, in this respect, that even at the present point in our research, the black-to-brown on surface is flanked by the gray pottery ceramics, which show great variety in form and pattern. (17) Using a procedure already adopted suc? cessfully by. W. A. Fairservis, L. Dupree and others, we shall first classify the ceramics on the basis of the colour of the decoration, then, once the various types have been defined, link them with some of the pottery production found elsewhere. 51</page><page sequence="74">There are not many decorative themes for the black-to-brown on surface, and they all follow a precise scheme. The inside of the bowls is decorated with a continuous border that follows the edge, and with two or four symmetrical motifs on the sides. While the border only reproduces geometrical themes ? festoons and garlands combined, broken parallel lines, hatched tri? angles and step patterns ? theriomorphic representations are sometimes found on the sides (fig. 15 a-e). These frequently consist of goats, fish and a strange animal with a triangular head, whose body is made up of two thin serpent-like lines (see jar fig. 16). But very often geometrical decoration is preferred for the innermost part of the bowl: it usually consists of a simple motif, placed just beneath the upper border and lying perpendicularly or diagonally to it, so as to underline the bowl's volumes (figs. 14, 17c). Among these motifs, a certain preference is shown for the linear type (straight and wavy lines, angular stepped patterns, broad multiple chevrons, fringed maltese crosses), as well as for wavy lines com? bined with small strips with toothed borders. The latter motif seems to have been quite frequent in prehistoric Slstan; it is basically a serpentine form ? often reduced to a simple S ? underlined by toothed segments at the curves. The bottom of the bowls is rarely deco? rated, and when it is, the decoration is merely an extension of that on the sides (figs. 8c, 18d). The jars, both large and small, are decorated with the same themes, presented in dif? ferent schemes. The small jars usually have a simple border based on broken lines, festoons and garlands combined in different ways (figs. 8-11, 16, 17b, 46-56). At times, a decoration is added to the frieze along the body of the jar, which is divided into four sections or ? metopes ?; the decorative motifs are usually theriomorphic (very stylized goats or stags) and geometrical (hatched rhomboids, garlands and the customary serpentine described above), while the composition either alternates a theriomorphic motif with a geometrical one, or two different geometrical ones (figs. 8a, 9b, 10b, 11c, 44, 45). The large jars have a closely-woven geometrical frieze along the neck and shoulder, while the body has two or four decorations, like the bowls; the fringed or plain maltese crosses seem to be fairly frequent among these representations (fig. 16). However, the entire shoulder and part of the body are often subdivided into ? metopes ?, containing stylized ani? mals or geometrical motifs. In some cases, the entire surface of the vase shows a closely woven group of wavy lines, stripes, triangles, etc. A jar fragment with this type of decora? tion was found below the collapsed rubble in room C of building 1; it had a handsome polychrome surface, though, with the spaces inside the black lines of the design painted red, yellow and white. This decoration was applied after firing and thus could easily be cancelled out by accident. It may well be that many of the pieces we found, decorated only in black today, originally had a bright polychrome decoration. The black-to-brown on surface ceramics of Shahr-i Sokhta has been found in all the other prehistoric localities of Slstan explored up to now, and its decorative themes can be linked with those of the neighbouring southern and eastern regions. In reference to the classification of the Slst?n ceramics made by Fairservis during his 52</page><page sequence="75">survey, the black-to-brown on surface can be identified with the ? Gardan Reg Deco? rated ?, always found in large quantities in all the prehistoric areas located (18). Even though the gray pottery is far inferior in quantity to the black-to-brown on sur? face, it demands a more complex examination. It is of excellent quality, extremely purified, fired in special kilns and almost porcelainlike. The main forms are: bowls with straight or slightly curved profiles; small and medium-sized jars, with broad or funnel-shaped rims; and some bowls with drinking-glass shapes (figs. 12, 13, 43). There is a very large range of decorative motifs. The ceramists of Shahr-i Sokhta really seem to have gotten their best results with these gray ceramics. The depiction of plants and animals in stylized form make this production very similar to that of contemporary districts in southern Afghanistan and B?l?chist?n. Goats are still the main subject for the animal deco? ration, but some fragments from the surface of the tepe that show stylized bats and birds (fig. 12), demonstrate exceptional artistic ingenuity. Certain friezes of goats, or even simple horn motifs, that at times run along the border of the bowls, can be linked with the inter? mediate and late types of the Togau production individuated by B. De Cardi (1?) (fig. 13). The plant element most commonly reproduced is a kind of date palm, also very stylized, whose fronds and branches are painted in such a way as to cover most of the bowl. Geometrical motifs appear frequendy, ably combined with naturalistic ones, either in continuous friezes on the outer rim of the bowl or on the shoulder of the jar. There are two examples of the swastika, both used to fill the inside of a bowl harmonically (figs. 12a, 43). This last decorative system is tied, on the one hand, to the production of Susa, and on the other, to southern B?l?chist?n (Shahi-Tump, Khur?b). At any rate, this gray pottery seems to have been the common patrimony of all the agricultural peoples of B?l?chist?n and the valley of the Hilmand, during the 3rd millennium. Black-on-red, the last type of pottery individuated, offered fewer examples than the other ceramic types found (fig. 18a-c). It is also very hard to classify, since it might even be a simple variant of the gray ceramics; the paste and decoration are practically the same, while there are differences in the colour of the outer surface (a rather dark brick-red) and the thickness, almost double in the black-on-red. In our case, it probably will not be necessary to distinguish between the two types of pottery, following the example of what was done for the ? Faiz Mohammad ? ceramics in the valley of Quetta; Fairservis first singled it out as ? gray ware ?, and later, when his research had spread to the material from the valleys of Zhob and Loralai, grouped it with the ? black-on-red ? ware. This is further proof of the cultural resemblances between the Slst?n prehistoric populations and the environment of northern B?l?chist?n. (18) Fairservis, op. cit., p. 87, fig. 38, nos. 1-21, fig. 45. (lf) B. De Cardi, ?New Wares and Fresh Problems from Baluchistan?, Antiquity, XXXIII, 1959, pp. 19-20. 53</page><page sequence="76">In some cases a certain vase was given a mark on the bottom, sometimes incised but generally painted. Fairservis collected these pottery marks for the first time, in reference to his finds in Northern B?l?chist?n (20), to be followed by other scholars. At Shahr-i Sokhta, five different countersigns have been distinguished among the eleven intact vases or frag? ments discovered: one or two transversal lines on the bottom (figs. 8, 59); a V (figs. 60, 61); a curving flourish (fig. 62); and a sun-ray design incised on jar fragments (fig. 63). These elements are far too few to supply us with information and comparisons. No less important are the many wet pottery fragments found on the surface: this type of ceramic was also individuated by Fairservis in the valley of Quetta (21), as uninterruptedly produced by the final levels of Kile Ghul Mohammad II down to the end of the Damb Sadaat culture. The forms are rather heavy: large flat-bottomed vases with ovoid bodies and distinct, broad rims. The decoration was applied with a fairly light, flat tool on the wet clay, so as to cover the upper half of the vase with a series of small, rough marks (fig. 57). This pottery too is found today in almost all the areas listed above. Terracotta Figurines. The sculptural production closely resembles that of the pottery, especially that of the clay figurines (baked and unbaked). These represent one of the most common handicrafts of southern Central Asia in the 4th and 3rd millennium. More than 200 have been found in the excavation at Shahr-i Sokhta, some extremely important (figs. 64-71). Almost all of these figurines represent oxen (bos indicus) and thus resemble the types found on the sites of southern B?l?chist?n and southern Ir?n; these differ from the northern and western ones, since the latter mainly offer goats (capra ibex), in both the painted pottery decoration and the sculpture. However, many examples of boars have been found (figs. 68, 69); this animal is rarely shown in B?l?chist?n, and seems rather to link Sist?n with the localities of western and northern Iran. Only one example of a fantastic animal with two opposed heads has been discovered (fig. 72), a very rare subject in our cultural context. As far as we know, the only similar case is a horse, also two-headed, painted on the inside of a bowl from Namazga Tepe that is in the Hermitage at Leningrad. From a technical point of view, these figurines are all very close to the B?l?chist?n production, both in size and in workmanship and painted decoration. One of the many ox-heads has a circle with rays painted in the middle of its forehead; this may be a solar or floral symbol, but is certainly a link with a similar one found by Fairservis at Damb Sadaat, in the valley of Quetta, on the forehead of which is painted a symbol that recalls the Sivaite ? yoni ?. (20) W. A. Fairservis, Jr, ? Excavations in the Quetta Valley, West Pakistan?, Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural His tory, 45, 1956, pp. 328-329, pi. 14. All the pottery marks shown are incised. (21) Fairservis, 1956, op. cit.y p. 269, fig. 59. 54</page><page sequence="77">Many ox figurines are barely sketched out of a small clay block, but do not seem to be unfinished works (fig. 67). They are more likely evidence of a domestic cult of the ox, in which the image may have been destroyed at the close of the rite. However, we still cannot justify in any way the enormous accumulation of statuettes found in the rooms of building 2, below the surface layer 1. There is a presumable ?nk, at any rate, between the oxen of unbaked clay and the clay blocks stamped with seals and also found in large quantities. One of the rooms ? probably room 2b ? may have held an altar-niche which has completely disappeared today. The hypothesis of the ox-cult finds another singular confirmation in the discovery of an ox-horn about 40 cm. long; it was found in room 2c, at the foot of the wall and below the layer of collapsed material. Its position, its exceptional size and the care with which it seems to have been detached from the parietal bone of the skull, suggest that it too was an object preserved in the house as expression of a cult that almost certainly had its origins in the economic and social structure of the population. Besides, the enormous number of ox bones found in every layer of the excavated sectors, clearly testifies to the existence of vast herds of cattle, and perhaps to an ox-cult that is in fact still alive today on the nearby sub? continent. As compared with the abundance of the theriomorphic figurines, there are very few anthromorphic ones, and they are poorly made and inaccurate. All the ones found up to now are of unbaked clay and thus easily deteriorated. They mostly consist of a simple trunk, vaguely cylindrical in shape, headless and with the arms reduced to mere stumps (fig. 72). In two cases, a crude belt has been applied to the trunk (figs. 73, 74). These figures are at times so crude as to only vaguely resemble a human body (fig. 75). It is more than obvious that we are far from the well-known B?l?chist?n statuettes, also crudely made, but which show a certain interest in facial characteristics and in the reproduction of hair? styles or ornaments (especially necklaces). It may be that future research will supply a satis? factory answer to this problem. Theriomorphic Vases. The theriomorphic vases, found in very few and always fragmentary examples, repre? sent an intermediate production between that of the vases and that of the clay figurines. Up to now, it has not been possible to completely reconstruct the form of even one of these vases (fig. 78). We can presume that the animal's legs were used as a kind of support (fig. 76) and that the skull, when perforated, functioned as the spout (fig. 77). Casal found at Mundigak a small perforated ox-head, which might easily have been the spout of a theriomor? phic container (22). (22) J. M. Ca sal, Fouilles de Mundigak, II, Paris, 1961, fig. 130, no. 5. 55</page><page sequence="78">Other Types of Ceramics. Again at Mundigak, an object was found whose ties with another find at Shahr-i Sokhta are really suggestive. In both cases, we have a fragment of a reddish terracotta slab (23). On one side only, each tablet has an incised human figure in profile, holding an oblong object; the eye is seen from the front, and in the example from Slstan ? better preserved than the other ? the legs are in movement (fig. 81). These examples are very close in style to the human figures shown at Susa and Sumer, and we need hardly note that such representations have never before been found in B?l?chist?n. Another unbaked clay object also helps us to draw Shahr-i Soktha closer to the B?? l?chist?n cultures. It is a triangular plaque, about 10 cm. long and 2 cm. thick; this object is known in specialized literature as a ? pancake ? (fig. 80). Excavations in the Indus Valley and in B?l?chist?n have brought hundreds of them to light. Its use has still not been accurately defined; Wheeler, after a thorough examination, defines it as an instrument con? nected with personal hygiene, without excluding other complementary or casual uses (24). Clay Boxes. This type of object was first described by Fairservis (25), and described as a ? house model ?. Fairservis' fragments are painted with the motifs of the ? Quetta ceramics ?, certainly close to the ? black-to-brown on surface ? of Shahr-i Sokhta (fig. 79). In reality, only one of the fragments fully justifies Fairservis' definition. In fact, a square hole which closely resembles the window of a house, has been cut into each of the ? sides ? that have survived; and the resemblance is furthered by the painted decoration, which frames these holes with short lines parallel to the edges. Unfortunately, none of the other fragments can be thought of as more than a painted clay box. They cannot even be considered ? degenerations ? of an original that rather clo? sely imitated the structure of a house, because the ? house model ? does not appear earlier than the other examples in the stratigraphic context. It is probably a mistake to consider them mere toys, as Fairservis does; they seem to be objects made for a definite purpose, and not useless trinkets. Some similar fragments found by Martin at Sur Jangal can help us to understand their function. We had a chance to study two of those fragments quite thoroughly in the British Museum, where they are preserved. One of them, which like the others has the form of a parallelepiped container, is painted on the outside with geometrical motifs, and supplied with four cylindrical supports whose modelling might represent theriomorphic legs (elephant?). (23) Casal, op. cit., fig. 105, no. 511. (24) R. E. M. Wheeler, ? The Indus Civiliza? tion ?, CHI, London, 1956, pp. 75-76. (25) Fairservis, 1956, op. cit., pp. 228-229, fig. 21. 56</page><page sequence="79">We believe that this object was made to serve a function similar to that of the ? house model ? mentioned above, and that one can therefore admit that the prehistoric artisans used their imagination to produce the same object with different forms. We now must try to understand the function of these clay boxes more thoroughly. A first indication is supplied by that same ? theriomorphic ? fragment from Sur Jangal: inside it, in fact, one can see evident traces of the prolonged action of fire. It thus might be a perfume-burner or a stove for heating food, but as yet a definitive judgement cannot be made. It is quite likely, though, that an attentive and fortunate study of similar objects produced by the artisans of classical and modern India might supply the key to the problem at some future date. Apart from Sur Jangal, Damb Sadaat and Shahr-i Sokhta, these boxes, with slightly different decoration, have also been found at Mundigak (26) and other minor sites. Stone Vases. Stone vases form a category of objects at Shahr-i Sokhta that is both extremely inte? resting and exceptionally numerous. These containers are usually made from three main materials: alabaster, sandstone and potstone. Alabaster is one of the most common materials found at Shahr-i Sokhta. It was used to make such varied objects as seals, pendants, beads and other elements for necklaces, as well as different objects such as spindle-whorls, drill-handles and loom-weights. We think we are justified in stating that Shahr-i Sokhta and other prehistoric localities in Sist?n were the production centres for the alabaster and sandstone vases and other objects; this conclusion has been reached not only on the basis of the fragments discovered there, undoubtedly important ones, but above all because of a series of elements that support our thesis. In fact, some stone containers that were barely roughed out, and others still unpolished, were found on the surface; and alabaster bowls and fragments, cut or polished at several points, which might easily have been identified as the remains of an in loco produc? tion, were also discovered. We also collected about ten lava stones, very hard and with rough surfaces, which had been smoothed down at certain points and notched at others, and whose outlines were very unusual (figs. 89-91). The nature of these outlines and some tests carried out on some fragments convinced us that these were probably instruments for work? ing alabaster vases. It can be assumed that these primitive tools were used in the final phases, involving the smoothing of the vases and the finishing of borders and bottoms. These are the first of their kind to be found; further study will supply us with valid testimony of the prehistoric technique used in making stone vases. Both the alabaster and sandstone vases have very simple forms, mainly because of the difficulty in working this kind of material (figs. 19, 20). (26) j. M. Casal, Fouilles de Amri, II, Paris, 1964, fig. 130, nos. 4, 6, 7. 57</page><page sequence="80">The majority of the pieces is made up of bowls with vertical walls and flat, simple bases; the angle at the junction of walls and base may be obtuse, right or acute (figs. 19, 82, 83, 85). There are also many bowls with curved profiles and flat borders, and many small bowls with bases in the shape of truncated cones, which at times lengthen out to form goblets (fig. 20). The diameter and height of such vases varies from the few centimeters of some small bowls (2.5 X 1.4 cm.) to the 50 X 40 cm. that can be assumed from some extremely thick fragments. The natural stripes in the alabaster, made more evident by the artificial polishing, are in themselves a type of decoration. None of the alabaster fragments we have found have yet shown any kind of decorative incisions, perhaps because this material, hard and fragile at the same time because of its crystalline composition, does not lend itself to being worked with motifs that endanger its structure. So that the decorative fragments we have collected are all of sandstone and limestone, and the very simple motifs show grooves incised in straight parallel lines or herring-bone patterns (fig. 88). Only a very small percentage of the fragments comes from a stratigraphical context: the levels contemporary with the destroyed buildings of sectors C, D, E and F. This allows us to affirm that there was still an active production and demand for stone vases, at least in the corresponding phase, which we date for the moment at the second half of the 3rd millen? nium. The three pots tone fragments are all extremely interesting. Potstone has always been in great demand as a material for making domestic pottery and decorative objects. Being a chlorite schist of minutely-scaled structure, it can easily be worked on the wheel, and the presence of serpentine in its crystalline composition gives it a pleasant green colour. Every age has made use of this highly available material. It was especially favoured in Mesopo? tamia for making cult vases, seals and other rather special objects. Two of the fragments found at Shahr-i Sokhta were certainly part of the same cylindrical, flat-bottomed bowl, decorated externally with a relief frieze that was probably continuous (fig. 92a, b). Only a partial reconstruction can be made of the scene shown: two feline ani? mals moving in the same direction, and separated from one another by a stylized palm tree. To underline the particular importance of this vase, let us quote an essay by F. A. Durrani, examining the typology and distribution of all those decorated potstone or soapstone vases found between Syria and the Indus, all of them datable to the 3rd millennium (27). Durrani observed that ? the vases from Indus Valley, Baluchistan and Bampur Valley are all deco? rated with incision, almost all the examples from Elam, Luristan, Mesopotamia and Man are worked in relief ? (28). It is clear then that the two decorated relief fragments from Sistan are the easternmost of all those found up to now, and thus propose the problem of eventual relations between Shahr-i Sokhta and the great Western centres.

(28) Durrani, op. cit.} p. 72. 58</page><page sequence="81">A small potstone container was found in the Et square, in a thick layer of sherds, which had been eroded and slid downhill. It is thus impossible to refer it with certainty to any part of the surrounding structure, at least for the moment. The vase is very small ? 5X3 cm. ? a truncated pyramid with a slightly broadened lip (fig. 93). A hollow in the middle of each of the four sides was filled with a disc of white alabaster, of which only one has remained in place. This piece, perhaps a perfume-vase, can also be linked with other Iranian localities. An alabaster object, similar in shape to our vase, was found in the levels of the 2nd period at Tepe Hissar (29). The Working of Semi-precious Stones. Although our examination of the ceramics and other handicrafts found at Shahr-i Sokhta has been a superficial one, it has allowed us to reconstruct in broad oudine a cultu? rally evolved community, one that was highly productive and sufficiently expansive in its relations with other centres inside and outside Sist?n. But the level of technical specializa? tion and the network of relations reached by this community is further underlined for us by the many finds of particularly meaningful objects, such as those in semi-precious stone, the production of the stone industry and, above all, the seals. Since the working of semiprecious stones was not tied to the basic needs of mainte? nance, and could make use of a steady supply of raw materials while counting on steady and established commercial channels, it offers us valid assistance in arriving at the most exact analysis possible, of the role carried out by prehistoric Sist?n among the most ancient Asian civilizations. During the preliminary research at Shahr-i Sokhta, pendants, necklace beads, small seals, etc., were found, in lapis lazuli, cornelian, turquoise and jade. Various-sized chips of these stones were also found, probably cutting rejects, and these, along with the discovery of tools connected with working them, confirmed the existence of a local school of artisans in this field. Lapis lazuli is certainly the most abundant among all the stones found. As for the chips, more than 350 fragments were found, while there are 36 worked pieces. These are mosdy elements for necklaces ? spherical, cylindrical and discoidal ? and simple quadrangular plaques, none of them longer than 2 cm. There is also an interesting seal for stamping, very small, and quadrangular in shape, with a geometrical motif made up of 13 incised dots (fig. 94). Lapis lazuli is not a local stone. It probably had to be imported from the Afghan mountains, along the valley of the Hilmand. Further petrological study and examination will let us clarify Shahr-i Sokhta's position between the mining centres of Badaksh?n and the markets of Mesopotamia and Elam. (29) E. F. Schmidt, Excavations at Tepe Hissar, Damghan, Philadelphia, p. 137, pi. LX, no. H 3498. 59</page><page sequence="82">A similar problem is offered by cornelian, it too used, even if to a minor degree, in the production of necklace-beads. The raw material was probably obtained from carefully polished stream-pebbles, which must have been quite frequently found in the Human basin, since they were washed into it by the waters of the Hilmand. Along with lapis lazuli and ivory, cornelian may well have represented one of the main elements of trade between Mesopota? mia, Dilm?n (Bahrain) and the mythical Makkan and Melluhha of Sumerian sources (30). This stone seems to have been used at Shahr-i Sokhta only for making small necklace-beads, either spheroid or biconical in shape. There are far fewer necklace elements in turquoise and jade; these two stones have rarely been found at Shahr-i Sokhta up to now, but they still represent a good starting-point for future research on trade in prehistoric Sist?n (31). As for the technique used in perforating these stones, we are offered some help by the discovery of two categories of objects: the handles for bow-drills and the drill-heads. The first are made of cones of alabaster, limestone or schist, perforated at the base. Casal, basing his observations on the use still made today of such pieces, recognized them among some similar examples found in the levels at Mundigak IV (32). These stones were undoubtedly used to keep the perforating shaft perpendicular as it was rotated by the bow (figs. 94-97). The flint or quartzite drill-heads are formed of a specially chipped pyramidal part, and of a perfeedy polished cylindrical body. It may be that both ends were used for different pur? poses (fig. 98a, b). Seals. Seals certainly must have been indispensable objects in all kinds of social and economic relationships which implied a signature or mark of ownership, in the ancient civilizations of the Middle East, where the population was largely unacquainted with writing. Further proof of this important function of seals is their rapid spread from Egypt to the Indus. Apart from Egypt, where the pendant-seal in scarab form soon took over, the Middle East can be divided into two zones as regards these objects: the western, with the cylindrical seal, and the eastern, with the stamp-seal. Sist?n lies geographically in the area of the stamp-seal, and our finds there confirm this fact: of the 100 seals or fragments of seals found, a good 99 were for stamping and only one cylindrical. This proportion leaves no room for doubt. The seals were made of potstone, soapstone, bronze, and to a lesser degree, ceramics, alabaster and lapis lazuli. While the shapes are highly varied ? discs, flowers with petals, crowns, quadrangles, ovals, stars ? the incised motifs are merely variations of the step pat (30) A. L. Oppenheim, ? The Seafaring Mer? chants of Ur ?, ]AOS, 74, 1954, pp. 6-17. (31) At this point I should like to thank Prof. A. Maresca of the Servizio Geologico Nazionale, for his valuable comments on the composition of the semi-precious stones found at Shahr-i Sokhta. (32) Casal, 1961, op. cit., fig. 135, nos. 11, lib. 60</page><page sequence="83">tern decoration that extend all over the lower half (figs. 99-103). Unfortunately, a detailed examination of stamp-seals would be useless here, given the lack of a specific typological study carried out on the entire category. One can presume that the incision of the pieces in potstone and soapstone was made by drilling a series of tiny holes ? probably using a bow-drill ? each very close to the other, so as to give an impression of linear continuity. The bronze pieces must have been made in special molds, of which no examples have been found; curved motifs are frequent, and there are occasionally flowers, maltese crosses, etc. Many of the seals in question might fall within the ? compartmented seals ? distin? guished by Piggott as characteristic of the entire B?l?chist?n area, with particular reference to the later Jhukar culture (1600-1400 B.C.) (33). All the seals must have been used as pendants; this may have been the best way to preserve them and always have them at hand. They all, with no exceptions, have either an opening in the back or two or four holes at symmetrical points. Some pieces are especially interesting. A seal of white alabaster, about 2 X 2.5 cm. in diameter, with a small catch on top, has as its only decoration a series of very simple linear signs, incised along half of the inner border like writing (fig. 105). A second seal, of ceramic, resembles a pintadera very closely. It is rectangular, 2 cm. long and barely 1 cm. wide, and served to imprint a figure 8 motif, the two circles of which are cut by an inter? mediary vertical line. This motif strangely recalls the ? serpentine ? underlined by toothed lines at the curves, so frequently met with in the pottery decoration (fig. 104). An example that is noteworthy in both size and decoration was found in the surface level during a short trial dig made along the southern end of the tepe. It is a potstone disc about 6 cm. wide, with four small symmetrical holes in the centre. It is incised with a central motif ? a maltese cross ? and with a continuous frieze, 2 cm. wide, that runs all around the edge. In Prof. G. TuccFs opinion, this object might have had a magical function and the frieze could represent some highly stylized naturalistic elements. This object bids fair to be a ? unicum ? in all of the Middle East, at least up to today (fig. 106). The seals were certainly used for marking on clay and other soft materials, as shown in hundreds of stamped clay blocks found almost everywhere. About 30 of them have been found at Shahr-i Sokhta, and on many of them the motifs incised on some of the seals found were perfectly recognizable. These blocks must have had many uses, but one of the most com? mon may have been that of serving as stoppers for jars and other containers; in that way the jar was closed and marked at the same time. The little blocks of stamped clay we found (figs. 103, 107a, 108a) are remarkably similar in shape to those excavated at Nippur by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. In some cases, the latter were still attached to the mouths of the jars. As for the only cylindrical seal found at Shahr-i Sokhta, it is merely a fragment, about 2.5 cm. long; the cylinder shows two triangles placed side by side, with a dotted border. (33) S. Piggott, ?The Chronology of Prehistoric North-West India ?, AI, I, 1946, p. 14. 61</page><page sequence="84">Each triangle contains a series of lines that vaguely resemble overturned T's. There is a knob at the base of the triangles, in the centre of the staff of the T. This seal can be easily identified by the nature of the design and the technique of the incision: it is a piece from the Lower Mesopotamia of the Jemdet Nasr period (2900?). Unfortunately this fragment too was found on the surface, but it still is highly important. Frankfort (34) has published types that can be linked with ours. Stone Implements. One of the most noteworthy industries of Shahr-i Sokhta was certainly the production of implements of flint, basalt, chalcedony, quartzite and other stones. AU the examples found can instantly be recognized as belonging to the Chalcolithic and to the Bronze Age: arrowheads, both attached and unattached to a stem; toothed blades; very thin, unworked blades; rather thick lateral scrapers; blades of a certain length, with parallel edges and a central rib, slightly worked; very regular blade cores and chip cores. To these implements can be added the small drill-heads already mentioned, and two shaped flints, one with a curving profile, the other a half-moon toothed along the curved side; the latter two examples are very rare east of pre-dynastic Egypt, and they can hardly be considered as tools. All in all, about 8,000 implements of flint and other stones, both intact and fragmentary, have been collected, without counting the many chips, that still have to be accurately examined. Of all the pieces found, the arrow-heads are the most elaborate (fig. 108). They range from 2 to 8 cm. in length, and are mosdy of flint; however, more than 600 of them are of basalt, a material very hard to work, but common in Slstan (we need only mention the great basalt mountain, K?h-i Khw?ja, located about 30 miles from Shahr-i Sokhta). If one uses Hugot's typology for the Saharan arrowheads (35) as a frame of reference, those of Sist?n would mosdy come under the types with triangular structure {armature trian gulaire) and with a leaf-shaped structure with double point {armature foliacee a pointe doub? le). The stemmed type is rather rare; Hugot defines these as having a spearhead structure with stem {armature lanceolee a pedoncule). The triangular arrowheads of Sist?n (fig. 27) all have a convex base, in the simple (nos. 1-4) and lozenge-shaped (nos. 9-12) variants. Their section is not always bifacial; many of them, cut from blades that have been retouched at the point and base, have a triangular and trapezoidal section (nos 13-16). The types with a leaf-shaped structure with double point are the largest of all ? 10 cm. long ? and are present statistically with a percentage that hovers at about 20%. The varieties distin (34) H. Frankfort, Stratified Cylinder Seals from the Diyala Region, Chicago, 1955, examples nos. 94, 99-105, 109, 114, 119-122, 126-129, 134 142. The date 2900 for Jemdet Nasr is the lowest given for this period by H. Ehrich, Chronologies in Old World Archaeology, Chicago, 1965, pp. 175-176. (35) H. j. Hugot, ? Essai sur les armatures de pointes de fleches du Sahara?, Lybica, 1957, pp. 89-273. 62</page><page sequence="85">guished by Hugot ? laurel-shaped (figs. 24, 25), willow-shaped and almond-shaped ? are all more or less present in the production of Shahr-i Sokhta. The amygdaloids are far less numerous, and are often confused with the unfinished implements; the shape is common among the basalt points, maybe since that stone is hard to thin down and bring to a point (fig. 22, nos. 7-10). Lasdy, as regards the stemmed points or, according to Hugot's terminology, those with a spearhead structure with stem, they are present statistically with a percentage of less than 8%. Whether they are bifacial or on a blade, the stem is never longer than a fifth of the entire implement (fig. 23). Almost all of these fall into Hugot's third group, those which have obtuse fins, since the sum of the three angles of the body is superior to 180?. Despite their truly exceptional number, the Shahr-i Sokhta arrowheads are basically quite uniform in typology. The large production of basic pieces might show a large and steady demand. Since a study of all the arrowheads found in the entire region east of Elam has never been undertaken, we can only arrive at a subjective interpretation of the pheno? menon from the few points mentioned in those excavation reports published to this date. On the basis of such controversial elements, we must limit ourselves to stating that the arrowheads discovered at Tepe Hissar, Bampur/Khur?b, Zhob, Mundigak, etc., can all be linked with the Sist?n types. The toothed blades represent another rather unitary product of Shahr-i Sokhta's stone implement industry (fig. 21, nos. 1-6). About 200 of these have been found, all on the surface too; their typical polish suggests that they are sickle elements. They must have been held by a half-tfnoon of bone or wood, to which these implements were ? attached ? with bitumen or some other natural glue. All these blades are rather large, trapezoidal in section, and vary in length from 2 to 5 cm. The blades are worked at a very broad angle and the teeth were formed by detaching small pieces of the rim at regular distances. The pieces are rarely toothed on both sides; in any case, this was only done when the first side was worn down. These toothed blades are the only sickles found up to now at Shahr-i Sokhta, and are common to the entire zone to the east, as far as the Indus. Some examples have recently been discovered at Pirak, almost at the foot of the Kirthar chain, associated with geometri? cally decorated bichromatic ceramics (36). The blades, large and small, and the cores have not been studied thoroughly enough to let us make accurate observations. We can only say that they are not very worked (the smaller ones not at all), and that these elements were probably part of a specialized group of instruments, because only a small part of them shows chipping from use (fig. 21, nos. 7-23; fig. 22, nos. 1-6). The blade cores are extremely regular and like those of Mohenjo Daro (fig. 26). The chip cores too, probably used for producing the arrowheads, seem to be as regular as the wear of the working allowed. Plate 109 shows two such cores, one of por? phyry, the other of chalcedony. (36) R. H. Raikes, ? New Prehistoric Bichrome Ware from the Plains of Baluchistan (West Paki stan) ?, EW, XIV, 1963, pi. Ill, nos. 13, 15. 63</page><page sequence="86">An interesting find was made among the bricks of roomb in building 3. Thanks to the mass of burned bricks in which it lay, a flint instrument, probably a bodkin-scraper, has kept its original handle: it had been fixed into a ball of mud, which on drying turned it into a handy paring-knife (fig. 110). In concluding our brief examination of the stone production of Shahr-i Sokhta, we must mention the two small shaped flints. As we noted above, these have the shapes of a ser? pentine (fig. Ill) and a toothed half-moon (fig. 112). Their thinness and delicacy keeps them from being catalogued among those implements used for cutting or scraping. They may not even be implements. At any rate, they can be called the result of a highly refined technique in working this and other stones. They were shaped by the detaching of minute chips from the body, until the thickness was reduced to 2-3 mm.; after this, the edges were accurately worked. Let us note that nothing similar is known in the entire area under dis? cussion, and, it seems, not even in Mesopotamia. One has to go back to the pre- and pro todynastic flints of Egypt, from the 3rd millennium, that is, to an entirely different cultural context, to find similar techniques and objects. Metalworking. Metal's slight resistance to prolonged exposure has not preserved many bronze objects for us, on the surface of the tepe, but the discovery of many metal fragments and casting remains documents the existence of a highly developed metallurgical industry. During his survey, Fairservis had already noted how much slag there was in the prehistoric areas of Sist?n, and had connected them with a large-scale production that probably used nearby copper deposits. On the basis of the elements we possess, we can affirm that the only working method present at Shahr-i Sokhta was that of full casting. Hammering seems to have been used only for finishing off edges, blades and other details. The furnaces must have produced very high temperatures, since all the slag was completely and uniformly burned, and the alloys seem free from residue, at least on superficial examination. The objects recuperated do not document the field very much: a pair of pincers whose jaws have a semicircular section; a pin with a flat rhomboid head, body in circular section and traces of decoration on the plane of the head (fig. 113); some fragments of a volute deco? ration with curved-line motifs; a certain number of pins with circular sections and the already-mentioned stamping-seals. The destruction level (rich in coal) of room X offered up a bronze point with a large perforation, still fixed on a wooden fragment preserved thanks to combustion (fig. 116). This must have been a spearhead or cane. Far more significant are some bronze implements also found on the surface of the tepe: some small dirks, a scalpel and a group of six fish-hooks. The dirks have a laurel-leaf shape to the blade, a pointed projection as handle and a very slight central rib (fig. 114). Their length varies from 10 to 15 cm., and their shape differs from that of the dirks found at Mun 64</page><page sequence="87">digak (37). The scalpel is merely a simple bar, square-sectioned and 20 cm. long; the head is battered by repeated blows, and the point is sharpened (fig. 115). The fish-hooks (if that be their purpose) are all square-sectioned, with rounded points and with the upper end of the metal bent backward to form an eyejhook (fig. 117). Bone Handicrafts. The working of bone at Shahr-i Sokhta does not offer any characteristics which differen? tiate it from that practiced in the other centres close to that locality culturally and chronolo? gically: bodkins made from sheep tibias, rectangular-sectioned needles with eyes, etc. (figs. 118, 119). Only one object is particularly interesting: on a fragment of the diaphysis of a sheep bone six transverse notches lie at regular intervals of 7.5/8 mm. from one another. Since the notches are not deep enough to warrant the supposition that this is a rudimental musical instrument, it seems likely it is a primitive ruler for taking measurements, which might be based on sixteenths (fig. 120). * * * Our first campaign at Shahr-i Sokhta, preliminary to a plan of research that will try to oudine the most ancient history of Sist?n and to frame it in the cultural context of the Middle East, has ended; it has opened a whole series of complex problems to be resolved. A single period has been documented up to this point by the extensive excavation, the trial trench and the material gathered on the surface, but we are sure that the imminent study of the material will eventually aid us to distinguish more than one phase. We already have every indication that we have here a highly advanced community; this is apparent in the buildings brought to light, the advanced working techniques for stone and perhaps for metal, the wide use of the seal, the indubitable ties that link this locality to an enormous region and a complex trade network that can only be glimpsed at the moment. Its origin, its relations with the surrounding world, its social structure and means of production, and lastly, its disappearance or the cultures that followed it, are among the ques? tions to which our broad and accurate research plan will try to supply the answer. As regards relations with the surrounding regions, we have already pointed out the existence of surprising similarities. The decoration of the black-to-brown on surface ceramics contains many echoes of the production of the Bampur Valley, not far from the coast of the Gulf of Oman ? in particular, the material from D?min, Ch?h Husaini, Bampur and from tombs Bl, B2 and Fl of the Khurab necropolises (38) ? of the material from Mundigak, (37) Casal, 1961, op. cit., fig. 139, nos. 3, 6. (38) A. Stein, Archaeological Reconnaissance in North West India and South East Iran, London, 1937, figs. XI-XIII; B. De Cardi, ? The Bampur Sequence in the 3rd Millennium B. C. ?, Antiquity, XLI, 161, 1967, figs. 3a, 3b, pp. 36-37. 65</page><page sequence="88">which is practically at the source of the Hilmand, and, still in Southern Afghanistan, of the ceramics of the small tepe of Deh Morasi Ghundai (39). But it is the gray pottery which can undoubtedly be considered the ? fossil-guide ? of all diese cultures, thanks to its excellent workmanship and the vast region in which it is to be found. Its distribution goes from period IV of Mundigak to the ? cairn burials ? of Umm an-Nar, in the Qatar (40), from the Damb Sadaat II and III phases of Quetta (41) to the Khur?b tombs (42). This pottery is always produced with the same forms and the same firing techniques. The decorative motifs are clearly connected, even to the point of coinciding in every detail, with others found thousands of kilometers away; such is the case with the stylized scorpion (fig. 13e) which has been found at Shahr-i Sokhta, Mundigak IV (43) and Bampur (44), with absolutely identical forms. Shahr-i Sokhta thus seems to fill a very defi? nite place in the cultural geography of the 3rd millennium B.C. And our hypothesis is supported by other finds as well: the fragment of the ? pottery box ? painted with a brick-red wash (fig. 79), found inside room 2c at the destruction level, the ? wet pottery ?, the alabaster vases, the arrowheads, the statuettes of oxen, the semi? precious stones and the stamp-seals. All these elements let us insert Shahr-i Sokhta into the cultural context of the ? Indo-Iranian Borderland ? of the 3rd millennium; and in this way they give further confirmation to the hypothesis of D.H. Gordon and B. De Cardi (45). They also let us link Slstan with those territories to which it has always been closest historically. Our research might also lead to a further clarification of the contacts which took place between these regions and Mesopotamia. The discovery of a cylindrical seal, probably from the Jemdet Naisr period, and of a potstone vase with relief decoration, and the abundance of lapis lazuli and cornelian, broach the possibility that constant and developed trade took place for a certain period with the cities of the Fertile Crescent. The discovery of the routes, the extent and the historical significance of these contacts remains among the main goals of our research. Maurizio Tosi (3*) L. Dupree, ?
