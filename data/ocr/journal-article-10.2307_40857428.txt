<plain_text><page sequence="1">28 THE YALE UNIVERSITY ON ILLUSTRATING KENNETH GRAHAME* Ì I tHE problem of illustration and book design in relation to the I text of a book has long been a plague to publishing. Although -*- questions of design and format breed a more subtle dissatis- faction, books cannot be set up arbitrarily in any style whatever, any more than the illustrator for a certain tale can be chosen at random from a list of selected American (or British) artists. As Austin Warren has remarked, there are spots where we would prefer to dispense even with the illustrations made by Thackeray for novels he himself wrote. Because of this problem, diere is a tendency among those who ap- preciate books to break the issue of The Book into a number of small compartments - Fine Binding, Fine Illustrations, Fine Paper, Print- ing, etc. - disregarding any interrelationship that may be present. Some books are bought to be read, some to be looked at; the book no longer is treated as A Book. The issue is especially forced upon us of late by a rash of "beautiful" books, designed with considerably less care and sold for the general public's "conspicuous consumption." Any number of case studies might be chosen to illustrate the argu- ment which I want to set forward, but one which I consider simple and quite meaningful may be drawn from the Kenneth Grahame Collection in the Yale Library, and in particular one book by Gra- hame, The Wind in the Willows. The Wind in the Willows is perhaps the "children's classic" most read by adults (since Alice, like die Bible, is more discussed than read). As a publishing venture it has been quite successful; it is, as a story, a thorough success. The story is a simple one, about a mole who comes to live with a rat on the River Bank, a shy but paternal badger, a toad who follows an Odyssey through the English countryside because of his weakness for motorcars, and their visions of reality. (This last expression sufficiently indicates the impossibility of paraphrase; I com- mend the book itself to you.) So far, six original attempts have been made at illustrating the book. We may glance briefly over four of these, for only the last two ♦The Gazette is glad to print the following essay by Albert Borden Stridsberg, 1950, as an ex- ample of undergraduate use of the Library.

The first was a frontispiece drawn by W. Graham Robertson for the first edition, published by Methuen in 1908. Robertson later commented: "I could not altogether forgo the honour of lending a hand, so I drew, hastily and very badly - the frontis- piece." His own judgment is sufficient. The work of Paul Bransom in the eighth edition, of Nancy Barnhart in 1923, and of Wyndham Payne for the twenty-fifth and thirty-third editions merits no further comment. At long last, in 193 1, Ernest H. Shepard, successful illustrator of A. A. Milne's series of books, turned his hand to drawings for The Wind in the Willows. The result, I think, was as satisfactory an edition of the book as has been produced. It was issued for the trade; the illus- trations were in pen-and-ink, incorporated with the text; there was nothing at all pretentious about the book, from its binding in dark colors of buckram to its simple open-set pages in a traditional type. It was not the first work that Shepard had done with Grahame. Apparently at the suggestion of the publishers, they had worked on two other volumes of stories, The Golden Age and Dream Days. The Golden Age, which had originally fallen into the hands of Maxfield Parrish and his luminous illustrative style, was issued by John Lane in 1928 in an edition limited to 275 copies and signed by Grahame and Shepard. The Bodley Head catalogue for 1930 described Mr. Shepard as the "perfect illustrator for Kenneth Grahame." The Wind in the Willows, with the Shepard drawings, followed in 193 1, two years before Grahame's death. Mr. Shepard's last work on Grahame was the illustration of "The Reluctant Dragon," produced by Holi- day House in 1938. This championing of Shepard as illustrator to Grahame will meet much criticism from those who are fond of the Limited Editions Club version of 1940, illustrated by the famous Sir Arthur Rackham, designed by and printed under the supervision of Bruce Rogers. They will point out that Grahame originally approached Rackham to illus- trate the volume, but that Rackham declined because of other projects then current; the volume would seem to be the culmination of the author's own desires. They might say, further, that it was a bit cruel to criticize these sixteen water colors designed to accompany Gra- hame's text. As the prospectus of the Club commented:</page><page sequence="3">30 THE YALE UNIVERSITY . . . Arthur Rackham died in the summer of 1939, but his last work was a com- plete set of illustrations for The Wind in the Willows. In 1937, he had undertaken to make a series of sixteen water-colors to illustrate this book; that these were a labor of love is attested by the fact that Mr. Rackham was permitted only one hour of each day in which to work, during the last months of his life: and he devoted each of these hours to his work upon these water-colors. The sixteen water-colors to illustrate The Wind in the Willows therefore represent the final contribution to the world of illustrated books of this master of book illustration; and connoisseurs of Rackham say that they represent some of his best work. It is really unfair to bring such sentimentality into the picture. To the large clique of Rackham admirers, it may well be that these water colors are some of his best work; they stand up well in their own right, but they contribute very little to the book itself as a book. It is not hard to point out that some twenty-five years passed be- tween the first publication of the book and Grahame's death; during that time he might well have returned to Rackham again for aid in face of the unfortunate illustrations thus far advanced for his book. But he did not; the idea was not obsession with Grahame. Nor can the Club be justified in commenting that, as to illustrations for the book, "the author died unsatisfied." Grahame became acquainted with Shepard's work through A. A. Milne, who adapted The Wind in the Willows into a play, Toad of Toad Hall, in 1926. Apparently he was more than satisfied; when a certain grandmama complained that an error in one of Shepard's drawings would never escape the critical eyes of her grandchildren he wrote a good-humored reply offering an hypothesis concerning the error (why Rat was sculling in the sketch when Mole was assigned to do it in the text) without hesitation, re- ferring to "these artists" as "exasperating." I doubt that he could have been as cheery about the previous artists. Having dealt with this objection - that Rackham was the author's lifelong choice - it is really up to me to support my own thesis, that the trade edition of The Wind in the Willows is a better book all around than the Limited Editions Club work. Let me briefly char- acterize the two. Rackham's illustrations are full-page water colors, reproduced care- fully on glossy paper and interspersed in the text of the book, not always facing the related passage. There is a definite element of un-</page><page sequence="4">LIBRARY GAZETTE 31 reality about them; this stems not only from the water-color medium, but from the typical Rackham technique of desolate landscapes and eerie trees. They give the impression of extreme detail. This unreality - which contributes so much to Rackham's illustrations of Grimm - is increased by the fact that from drawing to drawing the characters change in size, relative to their milieu. In the frontispiece Mole is hardly as large as the rabbits at whom he jeers "Onion sauce, onion sauce!" Further on he grows to the size of about six hands, half as tall as the horse that pulls Toad's gypsy cart. Toad in this same draw- ing appears to be as tall as the horse; when we later see him squatted on the back of another horse, fleeing the arm of the law, he is back to toad size. Rackham, further, has distorted the characters of Mole and Rat in the drawings. Mole is made youngish, thin, and decidedly hairy. Rat becomes lean, flighty, and idiosyncratic in appearance under Sir Arthur's pen and brush. Certainly he does not appear to be that sturdy, "responsible" rat that we know in the text and in Mr. Shep- ard's pictures. The characters lose their innocence; there is something lecherous about this hairy mole, dressed in a loose black velvet smok- ing gown and slippers, and something crafty about this Rat. The Badger too has lost his comfortable shyness and gruffhess, although both Badger and Toad as depicted are hardly more than elaborations of Mr. Shepard's black and white drawings. Elaboration has definite perils. But the real objection to be registered is that these drawings have almost nothing to do with the text. They stand alone, like so many "fine book" illustrations. This, a hangover from the pre-Raphaelite days, may be justifiable in the decoration of traditional fairy tales, but is harder to defend in original modern production. Shepard's drawings are considerably more self-effacing. Done in pen-and-ink, they appear on the pages with their accompanying texts; there are more than eighty of them, all of which have little meaning apart from the text, but contribute much to our visualization of the story by their presence. They are simple. They give a rather comforta- ble sense of realism to the anthropomorphic conception of the animals which Grahame gives us. Shepard does this by using strict realism in his drawings of nature (other than the animal characters), accuracy</page><page sequence="5">32 THE YALE UNIVERSITY in the drawing of the animals, and consistency in their size. The Toad, the Rat, the Badger, the Mole stay, each a constant size and a con- stant character. The Mole is plump and, though perhaps a little threadbare here and there, certainly not covered with lecherous black hair; he wears a neat, perhaps tight velvet smoking jacket. The Rat bears a "responsible" weight, in appearance both sturdy and reliable. The Badger is paternal only in the Pickwickian sense; though benevo- lent, he is also the small despot. And Toad - is depicted perfectly; I can say no more. When Time sought to satirize the late Mussolini, they brought out these drawings of Toad. Toad discouraged, exu- berant, complacent, bewildered - Toad magnificent. Rackham ap- pears to have copied this interpretation, and certainly contributed nothing by addition of detail and pale water color. The objection comes down to this. Rackham overelaborated, and thus sacrificed a certain realism in his drawings; he committed some errors in logical consistency, which also destroyed realism; and he misconstrued some of the characters in a shameful manner, for which there is little excuse. It is not hard to show why Sir Arthur did this. I believe that the villain of the piece is not Rackham, but A. A. Milne. And I am sure that Milne, who wrote the introduction to the limited edition, would defend the Rackham illustrations, even against his long-time collabo- rator, Ernest Shepard. First, about their physical appearances, Milne wrote in the preface to Toad of Toad Hall: . . . Toad should be short and fat, Badger tall and elderly, Rat and Mole young and slender. Indeed Mole might well be played by some boyish young actress. . . In this passage Milne hits progressively farther from the mark. Toad's description is correct but inadequate; Badger should be larger, but not of a paternal tallness; to say that the sturdy Rat could be classified by age is unfortunate; and I refuse to accept any image of the Mole, with his inordinate interest in the finer edibles of life, which reveals him as other than that comfortable shape which comes from super- fluous weight. But Milne's basic objection comes to "realism" of a sort in the il- lustrations. I insist that there is a logic to this world, and that for con- sistency's sake the animals should at least remain the same size</page><page sequence="6">LIBRARY GAZETTE 33 throughout the book. Mr. Milne takes exactly the opposite position in a passage which Sir Arthur certainly read: . . . Perhaps it has happened to you, as it certainly happened to me, that you have tried to explain a fantastic idea to an entirely matter-of-fact person. "But they don't/' he says, and "You can't" and "I don't see why, just because " and "Even if you assume that " and "I thought you said just now that he hadn't." By this time you have thrown the inkpot at him, with enough of ac- curacy, let us hope, to save you from his ultimatum, which is this: "However fantastic your assumption, you must work it out logically - that is to say, realisti- cally." To such a mind The Wind in the Willows makes no appeal, for it is not worked out logically. In reading the book, it is necessary to think of Mole, for instance, sometimes as an actual mole, sometimes as a mole grown to human size, some- times as walking on two legs, sometimes on four. He is a mole, he isn't a mole. What is he? I don't know. At least, I do know, and still I don't mind. He is a fairy, like so many immortal characters in fiction; and, as a fairy, he can do, or be, anything. Now, there is much truth, and much falsehood, in this passage. I am making the objection about "realism," and yet The Wind in the Willows has a very strong appeal for me; Mr. Shepard, moreover, found no difficulty, four years after this writing, in depicting the characters quite adequately in one constant size, with relatively few transformations. Quite true, they are a trifle larger than the ordinary animals, but then, human beings are a trifle smaller. The artist has successfully blended the human and the animal worlds, still preserv- ing - an essential element for the appreciation of the book - the irony involved in treating the animal world anthropomorphically, human beings as animals, animals as human. Had Sir Arthur not read Milne, he might very well have produced the same sketches that he did, for both he and Milne, in their conscious attitudes toward fantasy and myth, are products of the same system, left over from the nineteenth century, whose aesthetic unfortunately still dominates the "fine book" trade. The trouble with Rackham's illustrations and with the whole edi- tion is that they have been produced for Adults - to whom Grahame referred as "the Olympians." The pictures are pervaded with this grindingly logical a-logicality, based on the conviction that fantasy follows no rules at all. "Reality" has nothing to do with such litera-</page><page sequence="7">34 THE YALE UNIVERSITY ture, they say. So Mr. Milne goes out of his way to violate rules, to escape conventions, in about as romantic a fervor as that ever reached by the late nineteenth century. Children are not escapists, and Kenneth Grahame is not a Romantic, escapist writer. He has been taken up by the Romantics, of whom Milne is one, to his detriment. But Grahame constantly maintains that point of success which Milne reaches from time to time, giving us the height of "realism" - which is, after all, the state of forgetting about whether things are real or not. When Milne is writing at his best, he escapes his weak Romantic theory and reaches a sort of tough-mindedness which most children have all along, which they are able to maintain until they reach that progressive bewilderment known as "maturity" in our culture. Children are logical. The logic of a child is not our logic, but it is a logic, and as such bears the con- sistency of relationship and causation that is required to give co- herence to any experience whatever. Mr. Milne's critical passage, quoted from Toad of Toad Hall - belied by his own works - would suggest that fantasy is a-logical. A-logicality is incoherence. With this slight digression into literary criticism, I think that we are in a position to judge the whole problem. Sir Arthur Rackham's sketches err because they are autonomous - to be framed by them- selves; they really have very little to do with The Wind in the Willows. Mr. Shepard's drawings, to the contrary, are constantly with us, guid- ing and enriching our reading of the book; to appreciate them, the book must be read. The Shepard illustrations, logical and consistent, are never overdetailed; they follow Grahame's own dictum of "char- acter economy," described in a letter to Professor G. T. Hill in 1919: . . . our author [he is speaking of himself ] practices a sort of "character economy" which has the appearance of being deliberate. The presence of certain characters [we may add, descriptions, illustratory images] may be indicated in or required by the story, but if the author has no immediate use for them, he simply ignores their existence. . . He doesn't say they're not there; he just leaves them alone. ... I think you will find that this same character-economy runs through all the classic old fairy-tales and our author probably thought that he was sinning (if sinning at all) in very good company. The modern method leaves so little to the imagination of the reader that it describes with insistent particularity the ap- pearance of the taxi-driver who did not say "Thank you" to the heroine when she gave him 3d. above the legal fare from South Audley Street to Waterloo.</page><page sequence="8">LIBRARY GAZETTE 35 Our author would have treated a taxi exactly as he would treat a Magic Carpet (which indeed is just what it is) and would not have given the taxi a driver at all. . . Probably Magic Carpets had drivers too, but the authors of old saw that they were unessential to their stories, and ignored them. Here we see unveiled Rackham's error, Milne's sins, and a sort of creed of aesthetic necessity and non-necessity. Milne - in decrying "matter-of-fact minds" - was decrying the minds that insist we show how the carpet driver got there, and who he was, when such informa- tion is unnecessary. But then he tries to develop this into the curious escapist dogma of a-logicality previously criticized. Sir Arthur, de- signing his illustrations, was not thinking of The Wind in the Willows and the sort of picture that could supplement it by integrating with the text. His pictures seem overdetailed because they bring in all the taxi drivers and carpet drivers which are necessary to the drawings as independent works of art, but extraneous to the combination of text and drawing. Just as there is a variety of aesthetic necessity within the work of the prose dimension - expressed in "modern" terminology as the "objective correlative" - so there is an element of necessity in the in- teraction between the text of a book, its design, and its illustrations. None of these elements should be subordinate, one to another; nor should any one of them be so independently important that the book must be discussed as A Fine Job of Format and Binding, Some Won- derful Illustrations, and A Fine Story. All should contribute har- moniously to a greater unity, so that the book shall be one neither to be admired and stood on the shelf, nor to be pawed through and dog- eared with the carelessness of disrespectful overreading, but to be read and enjoyed as a Book, a whole book. In the 193 1 edition of The Wind in the Willows illustrated by Shepard, with no pretensions at all, but with the full cooperation of author and illustrator, the publishers produced a modest volume, perfectly integrated, achieving its whole job. One cannot demand more, and one should not be satisfied with less. Albert Borden Stridsberg.</page></plain_text>
