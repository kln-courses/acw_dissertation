<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stuart C. Brown, editor. Reason and Religion. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1977. This volume contains papers from five major symposia, together with replies and comments, presented at the 1975 conference of the Royal Institute of Philosophy held at the University of Lancaster. The chief value of the book lies, I think, in exhibiting the contemporary spectrum of views among Anglo-American philosophers of religion rather than in the profundity or the originality of the papers included. Renford Bambrough provides a good introduction to these symposia by outlining the various perspectives represented by the papers. There are several papers by Wittgensteinian fideists (whom Bambrough at one point calls "the grammarians"); others reflecting a traditional out- look, such as Swinburne and H. D. Lewis; and a few in a somewhat 211</page><page sequence="2">verificationist vein, such as Stopes-Roe and Lyas. After aligning him- self with the traditionalists, Bambrough outlines what he takes to be some of the major bones of contention among these views, implicitly inviting the reader to watch them emerge as he reads the papers. In the first symposium Hugo Meynell argues for the intelligibility of the universe on the grounds that, if it were not, science, taken as an understanding of a reality external to our minds, would be impossible. He urges this on the basis of his special theory of knowledge, derived from Karl Popper and Bernard Lonergan, which he summarizes as follows: 'The world, or reality, is nothing other than what conscious subjects may come to know by putting questions to their experience" (p. 28). Meynell goes on to consider three possible reasons for this in- telligibility the universe has. Naturally, he prefers his own view, namely that this intelligibility should be explained by something in the con- stitution of the universe analogous to the human mind. He agrees that his argument bears certain resemblances to the teleological argument, but he denies that his conception of God is anthropomorphic in any sense which positivists or others have been able to attack successfully. His fellow symposiast Harry Stopes-Roe advertises his paper largely as an attempt to understand Meynell. I think his attempt is for the most part unsuccessful, for reasons not owing entirely to Meynell's paper. Stopes-Roe introduces the notion of a "terminal quest" in order to explain what Meynell is doing and why it is illegitimate. After inade- quately explaining his notion, he suggests that such quests are illegiti- mate because they are thinly disguised ways of getting at a certain kind of predetermined conclusion, and because they are actually pointless. What we have here, as far as I can see, is a case of Stopes-Roe begging the question in the process of accusing Meynell of begging the question. He concludes that that world derives its intelligibility from our talking about it: "We give meanings to our words ... by using them ... in rela- tion to the world with which we all interact. Thus the universe is in- telligible" (p. 71). R. G. Swinburne leads off the symposium on the problem of evil by presenting a theodicy. His theodicy does not attempt to tell us exactly why God permits the kind and quantity of evil we find in the world; yet he wants us to go beyond the logical possibilities that are sufficient to demonstrate the consistency of the Christian concept of God by giving reasons which may be psychologically and religiously satisfying as well. He begins by showing that the amount of evil in the universe is limited and that God is not obliged to create the best of all possible worlds. The heart of his theodicy is that evil is necessary for the moral development of free beings. By way of illustration he suggests a number of ways in 212</page><page sequence="3">which various kinds of evil are necessary for moral development, and he also responds to several possible objections. D. Z. Phillips responds that Swinburne's paper is perverse: a theodicy cannot be provided, and the attempt should not be made. But the only reason he gives is an insistence on the "sheer pointlessness" of life's evils. He does not go on to argue that life's evils are pointless, or to offer us some reason for supposing that they are. He merely gives examples of specific evils and insists that it is somehow perfectly evident that the evil in question is pointless. In some illuminating and perceptive remarks the moderator John Hick makes an effort to draw Phillips into some kind of philosophical discussion of the issue. He suggests that Phillips's objection amounts to saying that "since there is no theos, there can be no theodicy." Phillips, however, respectfully declines to be labeled an atheist and insists that belief in God does not require that there be some reason for evil. He likewise rejects Hick's suggestion that God is a consciousness. This may serve to explain his position. For if God is not a conscious being, then presumably he has no purposes which evil might serve. But of course if Phillips still thinks of himself as a theist, he can hardly call himself a Christian theist. Continuing in a Wittgensteinian vein, Norman Malcolm argues that religious belief is groundless, but this constitutes no defect in religious belief. Science is groundless in the same sense. Employing Wittgen- stein's notion of a language game, he reiterates Wittgenstein's claims that, outside of a language game, there is no justification of it and therefore to seek one is to misunderstand the nature of the enterprise. He suggests that academic prejudice leads scholars to criticize the groundlessness of one language game while accepting or ignoring the groundlessness of others. Misunderstanding this point about justification has led to the present- day obsession with proofs for God's existence, according to Malcolm. He cannot understand what belief in God's existence would be if it were not belief in God. Religious belief, from the believer's standpoint, is not merely assent to religious propositions but is and must be ex- pressed in a certain kind of life. Malcolm's commentator, Colin Lyas, fails to take account of the sig- nifiance of adopting the stance of a believer, despite his efforts (largely successful) to deal with Malcolm's paper in a friendly and careful way. Malcolm is saying that a believer's religious faith is not and should not be based on the evidence he has for those beliefs. Lyas, however, ad- dresses himself to the different question of whether or not the belief (the proposition believed, abstract from a believer) ever is grounded or 213</page><page sequence="4">could be grounded. He points out, correctly, that from the fact that believers do not seek grounds it does not follow that there are not any, and he goes on to find wanting some arguments that there could not be any grounds. In a postscript Malcolm says that he means to be speaking of holding a religious viewpoint and not particular creeds or doctrines. Coming to have this religious viewpoint is perhaps a gift (as believers sometimes say ) , but it is almost never the result of being overwhelmed by evidence. Once one holds this viewpoint, he may be led by it to take as evidence or encouragement things which do not impress an unbeliever. Yet I wonder, as Lyas' comments suggest he also does, how one holds a religious viewpoint without holding some religious beliefs- creeds or doctrines. The Wittgensteinian reinterpretation of religion continues in the next symposium as Peter Winch asks what makes religious language religious. He rejects the approach which seeks its religiousness in its reference to certain entities or kinds of entities. Furthermore, while Winch will not say that theological or religious talk never has a world view involved in its use, he denies that a person who thinks using re- ligious concepts has a different theory about the world and reality from one who does not. Winch finds the origin of religious language in religious practices. Religious practices, he says, are rituals- "stylized," "ruled by conven- tional forms," and "stemming from long-standing traditions." Religious language is that talk which is used in and expresses (but does not explain) these practices and rituals. This conjecture about the origin and nature of religious language then serves to explain why there is a "difference in grammar" between parallel expressions used in religion and those used in the science of economics. Winch does not wish to be construed as claiming that re- ligious language has no connection with reality, however, and he ap- peals to an intriguing analogy at this point. While Euclidean geometry does not describe empirical structures, nor is it descriptive of some separate nonempirical reality, nevertheless it does apply to empirical realities. Just exactly how to understand this, however, is left as an exercise for the reader. Winch's paper is an extensively rewritten version of the one given at the Lancaster conference. The original commentator has been replaced by two: Michael Durrant and the editor of this collection, Stuart Brown. Durranťs comments are a defense of himself against some argu- ments made by Winch in the course of his paper. Whereas Winch would like to link closely meaning and use, Durrant seems to see mean- 214</page><page sequence="5">ing as dependent on the possibility of verification. His comments do little to advance the discussion and would have been better omitted from this volume. Brown's comments, however, are more useful in providing clarity, sorting out of issues, and correcting some mistakes in Durranťs reply to Winch. He rightly sees that the main issue is whether or not Winch's view implies the loss of an essential feature of religious claims- making some assertions about the way things are. He passes up the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate, however, and concludes by en- dorsing Winch's mistaken claim that "religious practices are not, at bottom, informed by beliefs." The philosophical exchange between Sydney Shoemaker and Hywel Lewis in the last symposium is the most satisfying philosophically. Nat- urally enough, they disagree with each other, but they also articulate clear positions and present arguments. Furthermore, their dispute raises a number of interesting and traditional philosophical questions which go far beyond the scope of their papers. In his paper Shoemaker suggests that there are at least two forms of Dualism and argues that the one which comports best with immor- tality is incoherent. He describes minimal dualism as the view that each person has a dualistic nature. Having a dualistic nature is consistent with a person's being an immaterial substance (Cartesian Dualism), but it is also consistent with a person's consisting (in part anyway) of or being dependent on an immaterial substance (Non-Cartesian Dual- ism). (An odd feature of Shoemaker's actual careful statement of minimal dualism is that it includes monisms of an Idealist sort.) Traditionally, Cartesian Dualism is joined with the claim that im- material substances are simple and hence indestructible, to produce some reason for believing in personal immortality. But, claims Shoe- maker, because of his distinctions, we would also require a reason for rejecting the possibility of non-Cartesian Dualism in order to make the argument work, so we cannot defend immortality just by defending Dualism. Finally, he argues that there could be no sound a priori argu- ment for Cartesian Dualism, and there is no reason to believe it. Hence there is no credible form of Dualism that makes immortality more plausible than it could be on antidualist assumptions. Lewis agrees that the case for immortality depends on the case for Dualism. He argues for Cartesian Dualism on the grounds that it is the most plausible and coherent way to account for the commonly accepted facts about persons. He declares that he is a Cartesian Dualist who be- lieves the self to be an indivisible immaterial substance, but he does not agree that these considerations imply immortality. His view does 215</page><page sequence="6">not prove immortality; it merely makes it a possibility by removing an obstacle. Moderator Godfrey Vesey remarks that the Christian hope of immor- tality is expressed in terms of the resurrection of the body. He finds it strange, as do I, that a religious person such as Lewis rejects faith in resurrection in favor of proving the immortality of some immaterial object. I share Bambrough's point of view regarding the views in the spec- trum presented here. Like him I understand (and hold) a traditional point of view- religious claims are truth claims, and many in fact are true. I think I understand the verificationists, though I disagree with them. But after reading this volume, I understand even less than before what Wittgensteinians think a religion is, and I do not understand at all why a Christian would be attracted to their position.
