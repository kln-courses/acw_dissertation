Gorski, Robert N. Green, and Edwin S. Nowak University of Western Ontario ABSTRACT Currently, one of the major challenges for automotive engineers is to provide additional protection to motor vehicle occupants involved in side-impact collisions. A considerable amount of research is being conducted into this problem by governments and motor vehicle manufacturers on a worldwide basis. Changes to the current safety standards relating to side impact protection have been proposed in both North America and Europe. The proposed standards involve the use of dummies in collisions between a moving barrier and a stationary test vehicle. A total of 22 side impact tests of production vehicles have been completed to date to assess the appropriateness of the test procedures developed in the U.S. and Europe in the context of the Canadian vehicle mix and associated side impact accident problem. Vehicle performance rankings provided by the two test procedures were found to vary greatly. These discrepancies can be attributed largely to the different loading induced by the two different moving deforming barriers. Examination of Canadian field accident data indicates that both barrier designs create loading environments which, in terms of maximum crush to the impacted vehicle, have a high likelihood of producing serious or fatal injury to a driver. Vehicle deformation patterns produced by the U.S. barrier, in the immediate proximity of the driver's seat, showed closer agreement with vehicle-to- vehicle damage patterns than did those produced by the European barrier. Delaying direct loading of the thorax until the pelvis has begun to accelerate was found to have a very favourable effect on the thoracic response. INTRODUCTION The past decade has seen an increasing level of research effort being directed to the issue of side impact protection and the means by which such protection can be improved and regulated. Much of this effort has been directed to providing the basic tools required to support full-scale crash testing of a vehicle. To date, international efforts in this area have produced an assortment of moving deformable barriers to represent a striking vehicle and no fewer than three different crash test dummies specifically designed to assess injury potential in a side impact. Sharp disagreements currently exist within the automotive safety research community regarding the merits of the test procedures, the suitability of these test devices and the validity of any conclusions drawn from their use. To assist Transport Canada in its own deliberations regarding the future course of action in Canada to regulate side impact protection, a combined field accident data analysis and vehicle crash testing programme was initiated in 1988. As the analysis of accident data has only recently begun, the present paper focuses on the crash testing portion of the programme. The rationale behind the Canadian crash test programme can be best understood if one considers recent international developments in side impact protection. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS In North America, all new passenger cars are currently subject to ( Federal or Canada ) Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214 which prescribes minimum strength requirements for the doors of the vehicle and related hardware. These requirements have been met typically through the fitment of corrugated high-strength steel beams inside the doors of passenger cars. Although U.S. field 497</page><page sequence="2">accident data suggest that FMVSS 214 has had the effect of reducing the risk of injury by upwards of 25% in side impacts with fixed objects, the same data also suggest the standard has had little, if any, effect in reducing the risk of serious or fatal injury in vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts(1).* A major research programme, specifically addressing the problem of assessing thoracic injury potential in vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts, was initiated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the mid-seventies (2). These research efforts have culminated in an amendment to FMVSS 214 which establishes additional performance requirements based on a full- scale side impact crash test of the vehicle using a mobile deformable barrier (MDB) to simulate a striking vehicle (3). Assessment of performance is based on responses measured on the U.S. side impact dummy ( SID ) developed by NHTSA (4). European developments over the past decade in the area of side impact protection have paralleled closely those in the United States. A test procedure which would allow assessment of vehicle performance, based on the responses provided by a crash test dummy, was first outlined by the European Experimental Vehicle Committee (EEVC) in 1974 (5). Over the next 1 0 to 1 2 years these concepts were further refined and developed into actual test hardware in the form of the EEVC barrier and a European side impact dummy, the "EUROSID" (6,7). The two test procedures share a common testing philosophy. Both use a moving deformable barrier to impact a stationary vehicle containing two test dummies seated in the front and rear seats adjacent to the side of the vehicle impacted. In virtually every other respect, however, the test hardware and test procedures differ. The mass of the U.S. barrier is far greater than that of its European counterpart (1361 kg vs 950 kg). The EEVC barrier frame is made up of six individual rigid polyurethane foam blocks arranged in two rows of three. Separate force/deflection corridors are defined for each block ( left and right corner blocks in each row are identical ). The U.S. barrier face is made up of two aluminum honeycomb body blocks, arranged one in front of the other. The forward element is smaller and has a very high compressive strength to simulate the front bumper and supporting frame assembly of a striking vehicle. It has been estimated that the effective stiffness of the U.S. barrier is nearly three times higher than that of the EEVC barrier (8). The U.S. barrier is also wider than the EEVC barrier (1650 mm vs 1500 mm ). * Number in parentheses designate refereneces at end of paper. The U.S. test procedure simulates a perpendicular impact in which a vehicle travelling at 24 km/h is impacted in the side by a vehicle travelling at 48 km/h. This is accomplished by impacting a stationary vehicle at 53.9 km/h with a moving barrier which has all four wheels crabbed at 27 degrees. The vehicle and barrier are aligned so that the leading edge of the barrier impacts the vehicle at a point 940 mm forward of the vehicle's wheelbase centerline. The EEVC test procedure simply simulates a perpendicular impact between a stationary vehicle and another vehicle travelling at 50 km/h. Design philosophies followed in the construction of the two above-mentioned side impact test dummies also differ. The U.S. SID does not provide articulated arm or shoulder assemblies. Each arm is represented by a "stump" made of soft urethane foam. The mass of the arm is incorporated into the mass of the ribs. By design, the impact response of the chest is intended to simulate that of an occupant whose arms are located along the side of the chest at the moment of impact. In contrast, the EEVC test procedure attempts to ensure a "worst case" condition in which the chest is exposed to direct contact with the intruding side structure. In the case of the Production Prototype EUROSID, the shoulder is constructed to allow the arm and shoulder to be moved aside. This characteristic is retained in the design of the EUROSID 1 . However, the lower arms and hands are no longer represented and the clavicle provides detents so that the upper arm can be aligned at 0, 40, or 90 degrees to the line of the chest. In the case of the U.S. test procedure, dummy- related assessments of vehicle performance are based solely on the responses measured at the chest and pelvis. Pass/fail criteria for the chest are based on the Thoracic Trauma Index ( TTI ). When applied to dummy-generated data, TTI simply represents the average of the peak acceleration values measured on the lower spine and the greater of the acceleration values measured at the upper and lower ribs. The limits prescribed by NHTSA are 85 g for 4-door vehicles and 90 g for 2-door vehicles. Assessment of pelvic injury potential is based on the peak lateral acceleration response of the pelvis. The limit is set at 130 g. In addition to criteria based on acceleration, the design of the EUROSID permits the use of criteria based on force and deflection. A rib deflection limit of 42 mm applied to each of the three rib modules provided by the EUROSID has been proposed by the EEVC. A Viscous Criterion ( V*C ), based on the instantaneous product of the normalized rib compression and the velocity of the compression, 498</page><page sequence="3">can also be calculated from the rib deflection data. A limit of 1 m/s is under consideration by the EEVC. Three contact switches are fitted in the abdomen of the Production Prototype Eurosid to assess injury potential to this region. A penetration of approximately 39 mm with an applied force of 4,500 N is required to close a switch. These contact switches have been replaced by force transducers in the EUROSID 1. In addition to accepting a triaxial accelerometer, the pelvis of the EUROSID also allows a direct measurement of the compressive force developed in the region of the pubic symphysis. A limit of 10,000 N for this force has been proposed by the EEVC. A Head Injury Criterion ( HIC ) value of 1000 completes the set of performance criteria currently under consideration by the EEVC. The level of disagreement which exists between U.S. and proposed European testing procedures, perhaps, can be best appreciated if one considers that the two test procedures reference mutually exclusive response parameters and injury indices. Finally, concerns regarding the biofidelity of both the U.S. SID and the EUROSID have prompted the development, by the General Motors Corporation the SAE Side Impact Task Force, of a new side impact dummy (9). The Biofidelic Side Impact Dummy ( BIOSID ) seeks to provide lateral impact responses which match the biofidelic requirements identified by the International Standards Organization (10,11,12,13,14,15). One of the primary objectives of the developers of the BIOSID was to reduce the inertia of the near side rib structure. This was accomplished by eliminating the use of spring and dashpot elements which are incorporated in the designs of the U.S. SID and EUROSID. Like the EUROSID 1 , the dummy features adjustable half-arms. The range of impact responses which can be monitored by the BIOSID is extensive and includes all of the acceleration and deflection measurements noted above. The implications of differences between U.S. and European test procedures have been investigated in a number of studies. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) of the U.S. completed a large 40-test programme using different combinations of barriers, dummies, and test procedures (16,17). The programme employed similarly equipped 1985 model year Ford LTD vehicles tested in four different countermeasure combinations based on padding (unpadded and padded) and structural modification (baseline and strengthened). The programme found that TTI values obtained with the EUROSID were consistently higher than those obtained with the U.S. SID. In tests with the EUROSID, the EEVC test procedure and EEVC barrier typically produced lower values than those produced following U.S. test procedures with the U.S. barrier. A similar 16-vehicle test series (18) was conducted by the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). A Japanese 4-door compact passenger vehicle was tested following both U.S. and EEVC test procedures. The influence of crab angle on test results was also explored with both barrier designs and dummies. For the front seat, higher TTI values typically were observed in tests with the EUROSID. In contrast to the MVMA tests, however, rib acceleration and TTI values observed in EEVC barrier tests following EEVC test procedures with both test dummies were substantially higher than those observed in U.S. barrier tests following U.S. test procedures. The crab angle of the barrier was found to have the greatest influence on the test results. For the front seat, regardless of test dummy used, rib acceleration and TTI values were consistently lower in tests when the barrier was run in a crabbed mode. The MVMA recently completed an additional series of 12 full-scale crash tests following U.S. test procedures and employing both U.S. SID and BIOSID crash test dummies (19). Production and modified versions of a mid-size 4-door passenger car were employed. The modifications involved the addition of 75mm thick pads in the vicinity of the chest and pelvis. The rib accelerations of the BIOSID were higher than those of the U.S. SID for the front seat. The opposite situation was observed in the rear seat. Padding was found to produce significantly lower TTI, rib acceleration, and pelvic acceleration values of both dummies in both seating positions. The addition of padding, however, significantly increased the rib compression and V*C values of the BIOSID in the front seating position. CANADIAN CRASH TEST PROGRAMME TEST MATRIX - Over the past three years, Transport Canada has carried out a total of 22 full- scale side impact crash tests at its crash testing facility located in Blainville, Quebec. One of the primary objectives of the test programme was to generate comparative test data using both proposed European and U.S. side impact testing procedures over a cross-section of Canadian passenger cars. Vehicle-to-vehicle collisions were also carried out to assess the appropriateness of each of the proposed moving deformable barrier designs to the Canadian vehicle mix. The crash test dummies employed in the programme to date have included the Production Prototype EUROSID, the EUROSID 1, the U.S. SID, and the BIOSID. The majority of the tests were based on the Production Prototype EUROSID. 499</page><page sequence="4">VEHICLE SELECTION - Nine different production vehicles were employed as target vehicles in the Canadian tests series. Included were eight passenger cars and one mini-van. The vehicles and model years selected, in order of increasing mass, were as follows: 2 door Chevrolet Sprint (1988) 4-door Toyota Tercel (1989) 4-door Hyundai Excel (1988) 4-door Chevrolet Cavalier (1985-86) 4-door Volvo 740 (1988) 4-door Ford Taurus (1988) 4-door Pontiac Bonneville (1988) Chevrolet Lumina APV mini-van (1990) 4-door Chevrolet Caprice (1988-89) In the interest of maximizing the number of comparisons of test results using both proposed U.S. and European test procedures, vehicle selection was performed in consultation with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). With the exception of two vehicle models (the Volvo 740 and the Lumina APV ), the vehicle models are identical to those crashed in according to U.S. procedures in NHTSA-sponsored tests. The same seven vehicle models were crashed in the Canadian test series, following proposed EEVC testing procedures with the Production Prototype EUROSID. The 4-door Chevrolet Cavalier was employed in the Canadian test series as a baseline reference vehicle. Nine tests were conducted in which the Cavalier served as the target vehicle. The Cavalier tests were carried out primarily to isolate various barrier-related and dummy-related differences. Of the 22 tests completed in the Canadian test series, eight involved vehicle-to-vehicle impacts. The vehicle models selected as "bullet" vehicle were as follows: 4-door Dodge Colt ( 1988 ) 4-door Ford Taurus ( 1988 ) Lumina APV mini-van ( 1990 ) The Dodge Colt and Ford Taurus were chosen on the basis of mass and dimensional similarity, with the proposed EEVC barrier and the U.S. barrier, respectively. The Lumina APV test was included in the test matrix as a bullet vehicle to reflect the growing representation of multi-purpose passenger vehicles in collisions with conventional passenger vehicles. TESTING PROTOCOLS - The test results presented in this paper are based on impacts directed to the left side of a target vehicle with the test dummy positioned in the front left (driver) seating position. In the tests with the EEVC barrier, the stationary target vehicle was impacted at a nominal impact speed of 50 km/h in a straight perpendicular impact. The centellino of the barrier was aligned to impact the target vehicle through its "R-point". As defined in the present programme, the R-point denotes the location of the driver's H-point when the seat is in its most rearward position. The driver's seat was positioned so that the H-point was as nearly as possible 50 mm forward of the R-point. In the case of the Production Prototype EUROSID, positioning of the dummy was accomplished following procedures outlined in the Users manual which accompanied the dummy. With the exception of one Cavalier test (C01), in which the clearance between the barrier face and the ground was set at 250 mm, all other tests with the EEVC barrier were performed with a barrier face ground clearance set at 300 mm. All of the EEVC tests were performed with the barrier ballasted to provide a nominal mass of 950 kilograms. Tests involving the U.S. barrier were performed following U.S. testing procedures, except that the position established for the driver's seat in the previous EEVC test was retained and the dummy was restrained by the seat belt provided in the vehicle ( all test dummies in the Canadian test series were restrained ). The testing procedures followed in the vehicle- to-vehicle collisions were essentially identical to those employed in the moving barrier tests. Tests were performed in one of two modes, "normal" or "crabbed". The former denotes tests in which the vehicles were aligned and impacted under conditions identical to those followed in the EEVC tests, while the latter refers to vehicle-to-vehicle collisions ( 3 tests ) involving Ford Taurus bullet vehicles modified so that all four wheels were crabbed at a nominal angle of 27 degrees. The impact speed and alignment of the test vehicles in the crabbed tests followed U.S. testing protocol. Two Ford Taurus bullet vehicle tests were also conducted in the normal mode. All five Ford Taurus bullet vehicles were ballasted to a mass approximately that of the U.S. barrier. Of the remaining three vehicle-to-vehicle tests, two utilized Dodge Colts as bullet vehicles run in the normal mode. Both vehicles was ballasted to the same mass as EEVC barrier. The remaining vehicle-to-vehicle test involved the previously mentioned Lumina APV mini van which was used a bullet vehicle in one of the Cavalier tests. Use of the production Eurosid 1 and the BIOSID was confined to four vehicle-to-vehicle tests. The only significant difference between the testing protocol followed in these tests, and that followed in tests with the Production Prototype EUROSID, was that both dummies were tested with the upper arms 500</page><page sequence="5">in the fully down position. This was done In the Interest of maintaining compatibility In test protocol with other test programmes recently completed In the U.S. using the BIOSID. PROGRAMME FINDINGS A detailed listing of computed Injury Indices and peak dummy response values for selected body regions obtained in the Chevrolet Cavalier test series ( Tests C01 to C09 ) Is provided In Appendix A.1 . The corresponding data obtained In the remaining 13 production vehicle tests ( Tests P01 to P13 ) are provided in Appendix A.2. Additional details concerning each of the tests, such as the mass of test vehicle, the mass of the bullet vehicle, the test dummy and its arm position are also provided in the Appendices. The principal findings of the programme for selected test groupings are summarized below. EEVC MDB CLEARANCE - The sensitivity of dummy responses to the ground clearance of the EEVC barrier face was briefly explored In two Cavalier tests ( C01 &amp; C02 ). In the first test, the ground clearance was set at 250 mm. This was increased to 300 mm In the second test. A Production Prototype EUROSID was used In both tests. Increasing the ground clearance produced a moderate Increase in the peak acceleration values observed in the upper spine and in the lower spine, and a modest increase in the peak force at the pubic symphysis. The TTI value also increased, reflecting the higher peak acceleration response of the lower spine. The deflections measured at the middle and lower ribs exceeded 42 mm in both tests and the lower ribs bottomed-out . The acceleration data and V*C values derived for the lower rib, however, suggest the dummy was subjected to more severe and, and very likely, more concentrated loading In the lower thoracic region in the 300 mm test. Except for the Increase In the TTI value, these agree quite well with those of tests conducted by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) In thè United Kingdom (20). VEHICLE PERFORMANCE RANKINGS - As noted earlier, a direct comparison of performance assessments following both U.S and European testing protocols Is possible for the seven vehicle models tested both In Canada and In the United States. Owing to the use of the U.S. SID, comparisons can only be made for the acceleration- based criteria referenced In the U.S. test procedure. The findings, as they pertain to TTI and to the peak lateral pelvic acceleration value, are summarized In Figures 1 and 2, respectively. From Figure 1 it can be seen that the TTI values obtained with the Production Prototype EUROSID and the EEVC barrier differ substantially from those obtained in the U.S. tests (21). Those obtained in the Canadian test series were consistently higher, ranging from 1 18 g to 193 g, where the U.S. tests produced values ranging from 58 g to 1 10 g. U.S. limits on TTI were exceeded by 3 of the vehicles in the NHTSA-sponsored tests, by all 7 vehicles In the Canadian tests. Rankings of relative vehicle performance also differed. The lowest TTI value observed in the Canadian tests was achieved by the Chevrolet Sprint, whereas the same vehicle model showed the highest TTI value In the NHTSA test series. The actual difference In the two TTI values, however, is small ( 1 18 g vs 1 1 0 g ). The largest difference in TTI values can be observed in the Caprice tests where the EEVC test produced a value which was nearly 3 times higher than that produced In the U.S. test ( 175gvs58g ). Differences in peak lateral pelvic accelerations between the two test series were far less pronounced. The U.S. limit ( 130 g ) was exceeded in one of the NHTSA-sponsored tests. This limit was not exceeded In any of the Canadian tests. No clear trends are suggested by the acceleration data other than perhaps a mass or size effect. The Sprint, the smallest vehicle tested, showed a much higher peak acceleration value in the U.S. test, while the Caprice and Bonneville, the two largest passenger vehicles tested, showed lower peak pelvic acceleration values in the U.S. tests. EEVC TESTS - Eight tests were performed following EEVC test procedures, using the Production Prototype Eurosid with the EEVC barrier clearance set at 300 mm. This total Includes the 7 tests which formed the basis for the above comparisons and a test of a 740 Volvo. The proposed EEVC rib deflection limit of 42 mm was exceeded In 6 of the 8 tests, while the proposed V*C limit of 1 m/s was exceeded in 5. It should be noted that the V*C values were calculated assuming an undeformed half-thorax dimension of 150 mm in the Interest of maintaining compatibility with much of the published European data. A 140 mm dimension Is currently under consideration by the EEVC. Using the latter value, increases the number of exceedances of the 1 m/s limit to 6. The two exceptions would then be the Sprint and the Volvo 740, the same two vehicles which showed peak rib deflection values below 42 mm. The proposed EEVC force limit of 10,000 N for the pubic symphysis was exceeded in four of the tests. No activation of an abdominal switch was observed In these tests. All HIC values were also well below the proposed limit of 1 000. The only vehicle which met all five of the above criteria was the Volvo 740. 501</page><page sequence="6">Figure 1 - TTI as a function of testing protocol ■ EEVC Eā U.S. 240.0 1 - I FIR filtered dala L 2°°.° - - Caprice Bonneville Tercel Cavalier Taurus Excel Sprint Figure 2 - Peak lateral pelvic acceleration as a function of testing protocol ■ EEVC ^ U.S. 180 "i 1 a 160 " ® 140 -- Caprice Bonneville Cavalier Tercel Taurus Excel Sprint 502</page><page sequence="7">INFLUENCES - The Cavalier test series included tests in which both the U.S. SID and the Production Prototype EU ROSI D were tested following both European and U.S. testing procedures. In the case of two additional vehicles, the Bonneville and the Excel, tests with the Production Prototype Eurosid were carried out using both barriers. The more important results obtained from this group of tests are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. From the TTI comparisons presented in Table 1 , it can be seen that the much higher TTI value obtained in the European test of the Cavalier, relative to that obtained in the U.S. test, is largely due differences in the loading environments induced by the two barriers. Both dummies showed approximately a 70% increase in the TTI value in the EEVC barrier tests over that observed in tests with the U.S. barrier. As can be seen from the other data provided in Tables 2 to 4, the thoracic response values observed in EUROSID tests with the EEVC barrier were consistently higher than those observed in the EUROSID tests with the U.S. barrier. From the data presented in Table 1 it can further be seen that, when the effects of the barrier are controlled for, the TTI values obtained with the EUROSID were some 30% higher than those obtained with the U.S. SID. The higher values observed with the EUROSID tests are consistent with the change in arm position. However, differences in chest design and compliance between the two dummies may also have contributed to these inprpflcpc VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE IMPACTS - As differences in test results between the U.S. and EEVC testing appeared to be primarily related to differences in barrier design, several vehicle-to- vehicle collisions were conducted to examine the representativeness of each barrier design. The vehicle models selected as target vehicles for these tests included the Cavalier, the Sprint, and the Caprice. The test results are presented below by target vehicle model. CAPRICE TESTS - Given the very large differences in the thoracic response values observed in the Caprice tests, two vehicle-to-vehicle tests were performed on this model of vehicle. In the first test, a Caprice with a Production Prototype EUROSID in the driver's seat was impacted by a Dodge Colt at 50km/h, following the EEVC alignment protocol. The Colt was ballasted so that its mass would correspond to that of the EEVC barrier. The dummy acceleration-time histories and peak dummy response values obtained in the Colt bullet test showed poor agreement with those previously obtained in the EEVC test. Although a similar thoracic rib deflection gradient was observed in both tests, the peak rib deflection values were substantially lower in the Colt bullet test. Whereas in the EEVC test, the lower thoracic rib had essentially bottomed out against the rubber stop, the maximum lower rib deflection recorded in the Colt bullet test was limited to 25 mm. The difference in of TTI value was even more pronounced. The TTI value obtained in the Colt bullet test was 79 g whereas a TTI of 175 g was obtained previously in the EEVC test. The V*C values obtained in the Colt (.14-.30 m/s) were also substantially lower than those (.40-1 .63 m/s) obtained in the EEVC test. The acceleration-time histories of the lower rib, the lower spine and the pelvis produced in the EEVC and Colt tests of the Caprice are presented in Figures 3. The external residual crush profiles for the two impacted Caprice vehicles are presented in Figure 4. Note that damage profiles are exaggerated by the choice of scales. In the case of the EEVC test, it can be seen that contact of the lower rib with the interior is initiated earlier in the collision than in the Colt test. On the basis of the residual crush profile obtained for this test it appears likely that rib contact was initiated by the inward collapse of the side door into the passenger compartment. That, in turn, resulted in localized loading of the dummy thorax. A much lower load path, closer to the height of the H-point of the dummy, appears to have been developed in the Colt test. In the second staged vehicle-to-vehicle test, the NHTSA test was replicated using a crabbed Ford Taurus as the bullet vehicle. A BIOSID, with the arms in the down position, was substituted for the U.S. SID. The peak dummy response values in the Taurus bullet test showed reasonably close agreement with those observed in the Colt bullet test. Peak lower rib deflection was limited to 38 mm with an associated V*C value of .71 m/s. The TTI value ( 78 g ) was essentially the same as that observed in the Colt bullet test. In contrast to the results obtained with the EEVC barrier, none of the proposed EEVC limits were exceeded in either of the vehicle impacts to the Caprice. The test results obtained in the Taurus bullet test also compare favourably with those observed in the NHTSA barrier test, both in terms of TTI ( 78 g vs 58 g ) and the peak lateral pelvic acceleration ( ( 55 g vs 60 g ). SPRINT TEST - The EEVC test of the Sprint was repeated using a Dodge Colt as a bullet vehicle. The acceleration-time histories of the lower rib, the lower spine and the pelvis produced in the EEVC and Colt tests of the Sprint are presented in Figures 5. The residual crush profiles of the Sprint obtained in these tests are presented in Figure 6. 503</page><page sequence="8">Table 1 -TTI variation as a function of testing protocol and dummy type Cavalier Test Series Barrier &amp; Test Protocol U.S. MDB / EEVC MDB (300 mm)/ MDB &amp; Test Related TTI Values : Crabbed Mode Normal Mode Differences ( % ) - With U.S. SID 81 135 67% - With EUROSID 106 178 68% ATD-Related Differences | 31% I 32% Table 2 - TTI variation as a function of testing protocol Production Barrier &amp; Test Protocol Prototype EUROSID U.S. MDB / EEVC MDB (300 mm)/ MDB &amp; Test Related TTI Values (G) : Crabbed Mode Normal Mode Differences ( % ) EXCEL 151 256 70% CAVALIER 106 178 68% BONNEVILLE | 180 I 239 I 33% Table 3 • Lower rib deflection variation as a function of testing protocol Production Barrier &amp; Test Protocol Prototype EUROSID U.S. MDB / EEVC MDB (300 mm)/ MDB &amp; Test Related Deflection values ( mm ) : Crabbed Mode Normal Mode Differences ( % ) EXCEL 38 44 16% CAVALIER 40 . 55+ 38%?

More importantly, the vehicle-to-dummy interactions produced in the Colt test were more faithfully represented in the EEVC test. In both tests the primary loads were applied in the vicinity of the pelvis. Pelvic accelerations exceeded 100 g in both tests. It is interesting to note that in the Colt test, the pelvis actually seems to be driving the thorax. It can be seen that, over most of the loading period, the accelerations at the pelvis and lower spine are consistently higher than those of the lower ribs. That suggests that the thorax was not subject to significant direct loading. This is also reflected in the rib deflection data which showed a maximum deflection of 8 mm for the upper rib and only 6 mm for the lower rib. In the EEVC test, the rib deflections ranged from 19 mm for the lower rib to 34 mm for the upper rib. From Figure 6 it can be seen that the EEVC test produced greater displacement of the side interior at the mid door height, which likely accounts for the higher rib deflections observed in the test. CAVALIER TESTS - Four vehicle-to-vehicle collisions were conducted in which Cavaliers were employed as target vehicles. In the first of these tests, a Cavalier was struck by a crabbed Ford Taurus at a nominal impact speed of 53.9 km/h following U.S. alignment procedures. The test was then repeated at 50 km/h, following EEVC alignment procedures. A Production Prototype EUROSID was used in both tests. As can be noted from the test data provided in Appendix A.1 , the peak dummy responses produced in the two tests all show extremely close agreement. The peak response values obtained in the two Taurus bullet tests typically fell between those previously observed in the EUROSID tests employing the EEVC barrier and the U.S. barrier. Relative to the both Taurus bullet tests, the U.S. barrier test produced higher pelvic acceleration and pubic force values, while the EEVC test produced higher thoracic response values. In the third vehicle-to-vehicle test, a Cavalier was impacted by a Lumina APV in a 50 km/h test, following EEVC alignment procedures. A EUROSID 1 , with arms in the down position, was used in this test. In terms of thoracic and spinal response parameters, the peak values observed in the Lumina bullet test showed reasonably close agreement with those observed in the crabbed and normal Taurus bullet tests. The peak upper rib acceleration value observed in the Lumina bullet test ( 1 18 g ) was lower than those observed in the two Taurus bullet tests ( 154 g and 158 g ) and likely reflects the difference in arm positioning between these tests. The response data suggest that a slightly higher load path, near the thorax, was developed in the Lumina bullet test. The lower rib of the EUROSID 1 bottomed out in the Lumina test. The peak pelvic acceleration and peak pubic force values observed in Lumina bullet test were lower than those observed in either of the Taurus bullet tests. The TTI value obtained in the Lumina bullet test ( 134 g ) fell between those observed in the Taurus bullet tests (131-138 g ). The external residual crush profiles for the Cavaliers impacted in the above series of vehicle-to- vehicle tests, together with those obtained earlier in test C05 with the U.S. barrier, are summarized in Appendix B.1 . A comparison of Cavalier crush profiles obtained using the EEVC barrier and those obtained in the two vehicle-to-vehicle collisions which followed European alignment procedures is presented in Appendix B.2. As noted earlier, the crush profiles obtained in the two Taurus bullet vehicle tests were virtually identical to each other. From the data presented in Appendix B.1 , it can also be seen that the pattern of crush obtained with the U.S. barrier compares very favourably with that observed in the two Taurus bullet tests. The Lumina APV bullet test produced between 1 00 to 1 50 mm more crush over much of the impacted area of the Cavalier above the door sill. The greater penetration in this test can be attributed to the loss of structural integrity following the separation of the driver's door from the forward top hinge. As would be expected on the basis of mass considerations, the crush values for the Cavalier obtained with the EEVC barrier were generally substantially lower than those observed in either the Taurus bullet or Lumina APV bullet tests. The differences are most pronounced at locations well ahead or to the rear of the of the driver's seat. It is interesting to note that even though the crush observed in the EEVC barrier test was less than that observed in the Taurus bullet test, the former collision produced substantially higher peak thoracic response values. The crabbed Taurus bullet test of the Cavalier was repeated, substituting a BIOSID dummy with the arms in the down position, for the Production Prototype EUROSID ( arm up ) used in the earlier test ( Test C06 ). As expected, by virtue of the change in the position of the left arm, the test produced a more uniform and "softer" thoracic response. The middle and lower rib acceleration and deflection values were reduced by some 20-30%. Similar reductions were also observed in the peak upper and lower spine acceleration values. The TTI value was reduced by 21% ( 109 g vs 138 g), while the V*C value for the lower rib was reduced by close 509</page><page sequence="14">c &lt;ł&gt; c (D CL C o 'co e c "5 o t &gt; »*- o c o TS c 3 «•- CO co co co © 3 5 a&gt; co c o OL to £ o &gt; s.

The arm effects are likely to be understated in these comparisons due to the reduced inertia of the ribs of the BIOSID. LUMINA APV TEST - The eighth staged vehicle-to-vehicle collision involved a Lumina APV mini-van impacted at 50 km/h by a Ford Taurus, following European alignment procedures. A EUROSID 1 , with the arms in the down position, was employed. As can be seen from the data in Appendix A.2, this test produced extremely low thoracic, spinal and pelvic accelerations. The maximum rib acceleration recorded was 43 g, while the lateral pelvic acceleration was limited to 40 g . The TTI value, at 37 g, was by far the lowest value recorded in the current test series. The rib deflection values, which ranged from 8 to 13 mm, were also among the lowest values observed in the current test series. The test mass of the Lumina APV was 1 ,754 kg. This represents a mass greater than that of most of the passenger vehicles tested in the current programme. However, the test mass is still substantially less than that of the heaviest vehicle model tested, the Caprice, whose test mass was nominally 2,1 25 kg. It is therefore unlikely that the greatly reduced peak dummy response values observed in the Lumina APV crash can be attributed solely to its greater mass. Rather, they appear to reflect the more favourable vertical alignment of the stiffer structural components between the vehicles achieved in the test as a result of the more elevated positions of the floor pan and seat assembly provided by the Lumina APV. Although the impact resulted in excess of 300 mm of external residual crush at the mid door height, the side structure was displaced rather than crushed. Direct contact of the door was confined to the lower section in the vicinity of the sill. As the primary load path was located close to the junction of the B-pillar and the sill, the B-pillar was not subjected to the type of inward bending that typically observed in side impacts of passenger cars as a result of the direct loading of the less well supported section of the B-pillar. MDB Crush Signatures - The vehicle-to- vehicle collisions produced a very broad range of dummy responses. Even so, the tests gave a reasonably consistent indication of impact conditions and interactions that were likely to produce high peak dummy responses, particularly with respect to the thorax. Specifically, delaying loading of the thorax until the pelvis has begun to accelerate is of paramount importance. This requirement is equally true regardless of whether assessment of thoracic injury potential is based on rib deflection, V*C, or TTI. The importance of controlling the vertical intrusion profile of the door to that end has been highlighted in a previous study by TRRL (22). The benefits likely to be derived by ensuring the door remains essentially upright through the occupant loading phase were demonstrated using a production vehicle modified to produce the desired door motion. The modified vehicle showed dramatically lower TTI and V*C values. The TRRL findings prompted a further analysis of the external crush data obtained in the Canadian series of tests. A simple index describing the door intrusion profile, in the vertical direction, was defined for each test based on the difference between the external residual crush value measured at the mid door height and that measured at the height of the H- point. The index is based on the two crush values whose longitudinal coordinates most closely correspond to the location of the dummy's H-point along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle ( external crush measurements were taken every 1 50 mm along the impacted length of the vehicle ). The subset of tests which employed a production prototype EUROSID was divided into three groups based on the residual crush difference (RCD) index. The first group comprised tests in which the crush value at the height of the H-point exceeded that measured at the mid door height by more than 50 mm. The second group comprised tests in which the crush value at the height of the H-point exceeded that at the mid door height, but the difference was 50 mm or less. The third group comprised all tests in which the crush value measured at the height of the mid door exceeded that measured at the height of the H-point. A breakdown of these three groups, by test conditions and selected peak dummy responses, is provided in Table 5. In the case of all four thoracic response parameters, similar response variations as a function of the RCD grouping were observed. For example, the maximum rib deflection was less than 42 mm in all four tests represented in Group I. Rib deflections in excess of 42 mm were observed in four of the six tests represented in Group II and in all six tests represented in Group III. Similarly, whereas the average TTI for Group I was 101 g, the average TTI for Group II was 137 g, increasing to 172 g for Group III. For the pelvis, no consistent trend in the peak acceleration value is evident with respect to the RCD value. The RCD values produced in the EEVC barrier tests showed marked differences from both those produced in tests with the U.S. barrier and those produced in the staged vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. In case of the latter two test groups, the crush value of the struck vehicle at the height of the H-point always exceeded that at the mid door height. The minimum difference was 36 mm. In the case of the EEVC tests, the maximum negative difference was 511</page><page sequence="16">Figure 7 - Comparison or residual crush profiles obtained in tests of the Excel EEVC test vs U.S. test 800 ļ 1 - Struck test vehicle : 4-door Hyundai Excel .

In most of the EEVC barrier tests, a positive RCD value was recorded ( i.e. the crush value at the mid door height exceeded that at the height of the H-point ). Each barrier design typically leaves a distinctive crush signature on the side of the struck vehicle. This can be best appreciated if one compares the crush profiles produced in the Excel tests by each of the barriers. These profiles are depicted in Figure 7. Although the maximum external crush values are similar in both tests, the pattern of damage is different. A well defined imprint of the bumper element of the U.S. barrier was clearly evident in the U.S. test. This imprint is reflected in Figure 7 by the greater crush values located at the height of the H-point relative to those at the height of the mid door over the impacted length of the side of the Excel. A similar bumper imprint is absent from the damage profile produced with the EEVC barrier. The general pattern of damage suggests the EEVC barrier induces more pronounced inward bending, rather than lateral displacement, of the less supported sections of the side structure of the vehicle impacted. The bumper section of the EEVC barrier, being relatively compliant, undergoes far more compression than its U.S. counterpart. Its foam construction makes the exact amount of dynamic compression difficult to quantify. The level of compression and disintegration of the bumper element, however, appears sufficient to allow significant early loading of the door section of the struck vehicle by the upper portion of the face of the barrier. Larger vehicles may be particularly susceptible to this type of loading, given the reduced amount of overlap of the barrier face and the more rigid elements of the side structure ahead of the passenger compartment. Further evidence in support of the above observations is provided by the door-mounted accelerometer data. Calculated door velocities produced in the EEVC barrier tests at the mid door level in proximity to the dummy were consistently 20-30% higher than those recorded in the U.S. barrier tests with the same vehicle. By way of example, the maximum door velocity recorded in the EEVC barrier test of the Excel was 13.7 m/sec in comparison to the 1 0.4 m/sec value recorded in the U.S. barrier test. CANADIAN ACCIDENT DATA OVERVIEW - The Road Safety and Motor Vehicle Regulation Directorate of Transport Canada funds a national network of university-based research teams to conduct in-depth investigations of real-world collisions. The purpose of this research is to assist in the evaluation of the effectiveness of current Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and in the determination of the need for new or revised standards. In recent years the thrust of this research effort has been a study of injury-producing collisions involving passenger cars. The Passenger Car Study (PCS) is being undertaken by ten teams located in universities across Canada. Each team selects a representative sample of fatal and personal injury collisions, involving at least one passenger car, from crashes occurring in a prescribed geographical area adjacent to the team's location. Specific data elements are collected on a wide range of human, vehicular and environmental factors associated with the case colli' ions. Transport Canada combines the data collected by all ten teams into a master data base. By i mplying suitable weighting factors the sigmiicance of the data may be extrapolated to national levels (23). Members of the university teams review motor- vehicie collisions reported in these police jurisdictions on a frequent basis. Collisions fitting the study criteria are identified and case collisions are selected according to the prescribed sampling plan. A collision meeting the criteria involves at least one passenger car, and is categorized by the investigating police officer as a fatal or personal injury producing event. The investigating teams conduct inspections of all involved vehicles where possible. Normally these tasks are performed retrospectively. Information and photographic documentation concerning vehicle damage and occupant contact points are obtained at the deposition points of the case vehicles. Site inspections of collision scenes are similarly performed. Members of the teams also interview vehicle occupants and other collision involved persons. Where possible, confirmation of personal injuries and autopsy reports are obtained from the admitting hospitals. For the purposes of this paper, analysis has been limited to data collected for the years 1984 through 1986. SELECTED CASES - To obtain field accident data which were directly comparable to the crash test data, cases were extracted from the Passenger Car Study according to the following criteria: - single collision event (one CDC) - direction of force was between 1 1 o'clock and 7 o'clock (CDC Columns 1 and 2) - impact was to the left side of the vehicle (CDC Column 3 = L) - impact involved the occupant compartment (CDC Column 4 = P, Y, Z, or D) - damage extent rating of 3 (CDC Column 7 = 3) 513</page><page sequence="18">- striking vehicle was either a passenger car, light truck or van; and - occupant was either a driver or a left-rear passenger Screening all PCS cases from 1984 through 1986 according to these criteria yielded a total of 40 occupants. Of these, 20 were fatally injured (17 drivers and 3 left-rear passengers). The remaining 20 occupants, 1 9 drivers and 1 left-rear passenger, sustained non-fatal injuries. Notwithstanding the constraints placed on vehicle damage by the selection criteria, the occurrence of fatal injury was closely linked to the level of external vehicle penetration. The average maximum vehicle crush for the fatally-injured occupants was 48 cm, with over three quarters of the reported values being in excess of 40 cm. Among non-fatally injured occupants , the average maximum crush was 33 cm, with just over three quarters of reported values showing penetrations below 40 cm. Of the 20 fatally-injured occupants, 17 sustained serious to critical (AIS 3-5) chest injuries, while 14 sustained abdominal injuries at this severity interval. Thirteen of the fatally-injured occupants sustained serious to critical injuries to both of these body regions. Rib fractures were sustained by 1 5 of the fatally-injured occupants. Two fatally-injured occupants received chest and abdominal injuries without any reported rib fractures. Five of the fatally- injured victims sustained pelvic fractures. Among the 20 surviving occupants, only one sustained injury at the AIS 4 or greater level. This occupant, a driver, sustained multiple fractures of the pelvis, a fracture of the lumbar spine, a ruptured spleen, a contusion to the left kidney, a concussion, and a number of minor lacerations. Three other occupants (all drivers) sustained injuries at the AIS 3 level. One sustained fractures of the ribs, the pelvis, and the right clavicle, a concussion, as well as various lacerations and contusions. The most severe injury to the second occupant was a collapsed left lung. The third driver suffered fractures of the ribs and the pelvis, a contused lung, and minor lacerations. The injuries sustained by the remaining 16 surviving occupants were all confined to the AIS 1 -2 interval. A total of ten victims, 8 drivers and 2 rear left passengers sustained head injuries at the AIS 3 or greater severity level. Sample size limitations precluded the use of the PCS field data to derive tolerance estimates that express the probability of injury to a given body region as a function of collision severity. Several observations concerning the level of agreement between the crash test results and the field data can however be made. The maximum external crush values represented in the 21 crash tests in which the target vehicle was a passenger car ranged from 35 cm to 59 cm, the average crush value being 45 cm. Of the 14 drivers represented in the PCS field data at this vehicle crush interval, ten (including 7 fatalities) sustained AIS 3 or greater injuries to either the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Accordingly, the collision severity represented in the crash tests appears consistent with that likely to produce serious to fatal injury in the field. This was the case for both test procedures. The average peak crush values produced in tests with the EEVC barrier and the U.S. barrier were 45 cm and 43 cm, respectively (U.S. vehicle crush data were used for vehicles not tested in the Canadian series with the U.S. barrier). TTI values obtained in U.S. tests of the above vehicles ranged from 58 g to 1 10 g, with an average value of 84 g. Based on NHTSA's relationship between TTI and the age-weighted probability of injury, approximately a 45 percent representation of AIS 3 or greater injury to the thorax, including abdominal organs contained within the thoracic cavity, would be predicted among drivers in the vehicle population tested . This is not appreciably different from the representation of such injuries in PCS. Levels of agreement between test results obtained in the EEVC tests and the PCS field data were varied . PCS data show a high likelihood of serious abdominal injury at the collision severity simulated in the crash tests. Such injuries were closely associated with the occurrence of chest injuries at the AIS 3 or greater severity interval. No closures of the abdominal contact switches provided with the Production Prototype Eurosid were observed in any of the EEVC tests even though many of the tests resulted in the lower rib module being fully compressed. This inconsistency calls into question the predictive value of the abdominal switches. On the other hand, the elevated deflection, V*C, and TTI values observed in the EEVC tests show good agreement with the representation of serious thoracic injuries in the PCS field data. DISCUSSION Incorporating staged vehicle-to-vehicle collisions as part of the overall crash test programme provided invaluable insights both in respect of the interactions likely to be produced in a side impact collision and in interpreting test results produced in moving barrier collisions. The number of vehicle-to- vehicle collisions conducted was increased from that originally planned as it became increasingly evident that the differences in results from U.S. and 514</page><page sequence="19">European test procedures were attributable to differences in barrier rather than in dummy design. In vehicle-to-vehicle tests performed to assess the appropriateness of each barrier design, both barriers were likely placed at a disadvantage by the choice of vehicle models selected to serve as striking vehicles. All three bullet vehicles featured reasonably aerodynamic front-end profiles. The simple geometric shapes of both barriers bear much closer resemblance to vehicle design practices of the 1970s than those of today. While vehicles with more box-like front-ends could have been selected, it was felt that it was important that the front-end design of the bullet vehicles reflect design practices likely to be followed over the next decade. At the begining of this study it had been expected that assessments of vehicle performance based on the European testing procedure would differ from those based on the U.S. testing procedure. The nature and magnitude of these differences differ from those which had been anticipated. In describing the attributes of a moving barrier, the terms "aggressivity" and "rigidity" are not necessarily interchangeable. Despite its lower mass and reduced stiffness, the EEVC barrier frequently provided much more severe loading than its U.S. counterpart. The design characteristics of the EEVC barrier appear to be at odds with North American design and construction practices, particularly as they pertain to the front-end stiffness of passenger vehicles at the height of the bumper. Ensuring an accurate representation of the load path at the height of the bumper is critical from two standpoints. Firstly, it directly influences the time at which significant loading of the pelvis begins, as well as the time period over which the pelvis is accelerated. Secondly, it either directly or indirectly influences the intrusion profile of the door. The indirect influence results from the fact that the intrusion profile of the door in proximity to the occupant is, in large part, controlled by the deformation pattern of the B-pillar which in turn is influenced by the height of the applied load. Deformation patterns produced by the U.S. barrier showed much closer agreement to those produced in the vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. This can be attributed to the fact that the front-to-side stiffness ratio of North American vehicles at the height of the bumper is better represented by the U.S. barrier than the European. The potential drawbacks to the current U.S. requirements are primarily related to the limitations imposed by the design of the U.S. SID. One such limitation is the arm position, which is fixed in the down position. Differences in arm position, in combination with different chest designs, have a significant influence on chest response. An additional drawback to the arm down position is that it has the potential of masking the effects of changes in the loading introduced through design countermeasures. Relying solely on TTI to assess thoracic injury potential has a similar drawback. Similar TTI values can be produced by completely different loadings as is evident from the Colt-to-Sprint test. That test produced a relatively high TTI value with almost no deformation of the chest ( i.e. principally as a result of rigid-body accelerations ). Increasing the amount of "pelvic-lead" experienced by a dummy appears to have a very favourable effect on thoracic responses. The real magnitude of these benefits may be misrepresented in dummy tests, since the lateral stiffness of test dummies is likely to be much greater than that of human occupants. Biofidelic response requirements addressing the lateral bending stiffness of the spine may need to be specified. The collision severities represented by the two testing procedures appear to be consistent with those likely to produce serious to fatal injury to occupants involved in a near-side impact. Both test procedures indicate the highest risk of injury is to the chest which is also consistent with Canadian accident data Although the EEVC test references a broader range of injury indices than does the U.S. test, exceedances of the proposed limit values in the Canadian series of EEVC tests with the EUROSID were confined to the chest and pelvis. Both of these body regions are addressed by the U.S., but using a different set of criteria. The EUROSID 1 and BIOSID both appear to represent attractive alternatives to the U.S. SID in that they support either deflection-based or force-based criteria in these regions in addition to the acceleration-based criteria supported by the U.S. SID. International test programmes currently in progress will likely resolve whether these new dummies can withstand the rigours of crash testing while providing the levels of repeatability necessary in a regulatory environment. What represents the optimum combination of test dummy and injury criteria has yet to be determined. This is intimately linked to the level of biofidelity provided by the dummy and the validity of the supporting injury criteria. The latter issue is currently being addressed in a separate study, and not doubt, by others in the international automotive research community.
