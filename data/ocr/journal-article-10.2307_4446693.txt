<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEALING SEA by George D. Ruggieri and Norman David Rosenberg. 1978. Dodd, Mead and Company (79 Madison Avenue, New York 10016). 168 p. $7.95. An accomplished marine biologist, who is also a priest, has teamed with a poet to provide a literary and sometimes dramatic work on marine life. Onta, a young female octopus, is used as an organizing center for the major divisions of the book-"Morning," "Afternoon," and "Night." The diverse marine forms from benthos to surface are described as their behavior relates to the time of day. An underlying theme is that medicines are now derived from the sea and greater potential exists for more. The writing borders constantly on anthropomorphism. At times the de- scriptions are wordy, and the compound sentences are difficult to read for con- tent. One sentence contains seventy-five words. Many readers may find it difficult to keep a main idea foremost until such sentences end. The writing is uneven. Other narrative consists of simple, declarative sentences that relate con- cepts and information concisely and clearly. A few line-drawings are scattered throughout the book, most of which are neither necessary nor useful as textual aids. The work of many researchers is described; however, no references are cited. There is no bibliography. A twenty- nine word glossary and index are included. Despite these criticisms, the book is worthy as a general library reference. It is sometimes more literary and nontechni- cal than scientific, which may limit its usefulness for a professional library. However, plenty of scientific information is here for the serious biologist. John R. Pancella Montgomery County Public Schools Rockuille, Maryland</page></plain_text>
