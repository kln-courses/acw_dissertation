ISBN 0-89757- 051-0. This book publishes the results of a symposium held at SUNY Albany in November 1998 which aimed to present a comprehensive picture of evidence which has emerged during the last decade for the early occupation and settlement of Cyprus and to discuss its significance for the wider eastern Mediterranean re- gion. Excavations at several sites on the island, in particular the epi-Paleolithic rock shelter site of Akro- tiri-Aetokremnos and the early Aceramic Neolithic sites of Parekklisha-Shillourokambos and Kissonerga- Mylouthkia, have caused archaeologists both in Cyp- rus and on the mainland to radically re-think earlier models of island colonization, processes of sedentari- zation and the origins of agriculture. The surprisingly early dates for the new Cypriot evidence (c. 10000 B. C. for Akrotiri, and c. 8500-7000 B. C. for the early Aceramic sites) have added nearly three millennia to the island's prehistory (thought previously to begin c. 7000 B. C. with the later Aceramic site of Khirokitia- Archiv jür Orientforschung 50 (2003/2004)</page><page sequence="2">484 Rezensionen Vounoi) and now pose crucial questions concerning the chronology and development of agriculture among the contemporary cultures of the Levantine mainland. In this light, Swiny's initial statement in the preface of the book, that "nothing short of a revolution has overtaken prehistoric Cypriot studies in the last dec- ade," is not an exaggeration. Most of the papers in this volume were delivered at the Albany symposium and consist of summary reports by the relevant directors of excavations (Simmons at Akrotiri, Le Brun at Khirokitia, and Guilaine at Shil- lourokambos), as well as by their specialist colleagues. Two additional papers not presented at the symposium (one by Todd and one by Peltenburg et al.) have been included in the publication in order to provide a more complete picture of the newly emerging evidence as seen at the key sites of Kalavasos-Tenta (part of which has recently been re-assigned to the early Aceramic period by its excavator Todd) and Kissonerga-My- louthkia, a predominantly Chalcolithic site which has recently yielded a series of early Neolithic water wells. The final paper in the volume, by Ofer Bar-Yosef, places the Cypriot evidence into a broader context by providing a summary of contemporary developments on the mainland cultures of the PPNA and PPNB, the first farming societies of the Levant. The contribution by Alan Simmons (pp. 1-18) pro- vides a general summary of the discoveries at the epi- Paleolithic rock shelter of Aetokremnos on the Akro- tiri peninsula. As the site is now well known, emphasis is given here to some of its more controversial aspects, such as the association between cultural material and the remains of Phanourios , or pygmy hippopotamus, which apparently formed the mainstay of the diet of these first known visitors to the island. Earlier critics of the site, even those who have been deeply skeptical of the anthropogenic nature of the excavated remains, now accept the Akrotiri rock shelter as a bona fide hunter-gatherer site. This is no doubt due to the publi- cation by Simmons and associates in 1999 of the final excavation report, which dealt with issues of dating, stratigraphy and taphonomy in considerable detail and succeeded in resolving some of the most serious con- troversies. Now that the bulk of scholarly doubt has been put to rest, archaeologists can begin to focus on the major challenges presented by this important site, in particular its confrontation with the traditional view that Mediterranean islands like Cyprus were only in- habited at a later date (c. 7000-6500 B. C.) and by agriculturalists rather than hunter-gatherers. In the ac- companying report by Reese (pp. 19-36) faunal remains from eleven "cultural features" (mostly hearths) from Akrotiri are presented, as are MNI counts from pygmy hippo remains in stratum 4C, which yielded a total of more than 15000 pygmy hippo bones. Reese's final report was not included in Simmons et al. (1999) and is promised in a forthcoming volume. Work by the French team at Parekklisha-Shillouro- kambos forms the subject of the next two papers in this volume. Since excavations are still underway at Shillourokambos, the contribution by Guiliane and Briois (pp. 37-54) must be regarded as a preliminary site report. Radiocarbon dates from the site place it in the early Aceramic Neolithic period (c. 8500-7000 B. C.), pre-dating the larger Aceramic Neolithic site of Khirokitia by more than a millennium. Excavated remains include burials, circular structures, wells, and a large triangular structure indicated by trenches and postholes that has been interpreted as a possible woo- den enclosure or stockade; in addition, the remains of domesticated or semi-domesticated species of sheep, goat, pig, and cattle have been discovered. From the Early Phase at the site, dating to the mid-9lh millenni- um, comes intriguing evidence for the island's earliest known repertoire of symbolic artwork, including en- graved pebbles, a lime plaster figurine, and a sepenti- nite head of a figurine that appears to combine zoo- morphic and anthropomorphic elements. While some ground stone and obsidian have been reported (the latter from sources in Cappadocia), it is the rich chipped stone industry that dominates the lithic assemblage and is instrumental for linking the site to contempo- rary cultures on the mainland. The accompanying re- port by project zooarchaeologist J.-D. Vigne (pp. 55- 60) is more interpretive in its scope, highlighting the challenges posed by the faunal assemblage at Shillou- rokambos to traditional models of animal husbandry in the eastern Mediterranean, which place the initial do- mestication of animals in the 8th millennium B. C. (rather than the 9th), and then only to sheep and goat. Shillourokambos, it should be noted, has produced the earliest evidence of domestic cattle on the island, more than 5000 years earlier than previously recorded. The contribution by Peltenburg et al. (pp. 61-94) summarizes the excavation of two early Aceramic water wells at Kissonerga-Mylouthkia near Paphos; these are contemporary with the early and late phases at Shillourokambos, and the earliest of the two (well 116) is now the earliest known water well in the world. This paper is the only one in the volume to discuss the new evidence from the 9th-8th millennia Cyprus within a broader theoretical and cultural frame- work. Careful comparison of chipped stone assem- blages in Cyprus and the mainland forms the basis for the proposal by Peltenburg and his team of a new terminology for the early Aceramic phases of the island: Cypro-PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B). While other archaeologists working on the island have been slow to adopt this proposed terminology, preferring instead the more generic term "early Aceramic," the close parallels between Cyprus and contemporary PPN cultures of the mainland are readily apparent in all</page><page sequence="3">Rezensionen 485 categories of cultural remains (for further discussion, see Peltenburg et al. 2001). In addition, several im- portant issues raised by the new material are consid- ered, such as why it has taken so long for archaeolo- gists to recognize a pre-Khirokitian phase of the Neo- lithic and how the new Cypriot evidence will cause archaeologists on the mainland to rethink previous theories of Neolithization, in particular the adoption of a "comprehensive Aceramic Neolithic package" on the island already during the 9th millennium B. C. The site of Kalavasos-Tenta is the subject of a contribution by its excavator, Ian Todd (pp. 95-108). This site, which was excavated from 1976-84 and was widely regarded as contemporary with its neighbor Khirokitia (see Todd 1987), has now been re-interpret- ed as having a substantial early Aceramic component in Period 5 represented by architecture as well as by chipped stone assemblages. The fact that this was not recognized as such, either by the excavator or by other archaeologists, can be explained in part by problems with radiocarbon dates from the site, but also demon- strates the power of status-quo thinking which until recently insisted that Khirokitia was the island's ear- liest settlement. It is perhaps auspicious that vol. 2 of the Tenta publication has not yet appeared in print, thus affording an opportunity to re-interpret some of the evidence in light of the recent discoveries at Shillourokambos and Mylouthkia. The contributions by Le Brun (pp. 109-118) and Hansen (pp. 119-128) provide competent summaries of the later Aceramic Neolithic period, but they unfor- tunately add little to the aforegoing discussion. While 7th millennium Khirokitia now represents the end of the Aceramic sequence rather than the beginning, there is a pressing need to link the developments at Shillou- rokambos and Mylouthkia with the succeeding Khiro- kitian, known primarily from the site of Khirokitia itself, but also from other important sites such as Cape Andreas, Kholetria-Ortos, and the later phases of oc- cupation at Kalavasos-Tenta. How the earliest farming communities, with their small sizes and modest archi- tectural remains, developed into more substantial com- munities remains a mystery, yet these issues were apparently not discussed at the roundtable meeting in Albany. A reading of Hansen's paper, moreover, sug- gests that papers included in the volume but not deliv- ered at the roundtable in 1998 (such as the contribu- tion by Peltenburg et al.) were not circulated to other authors prior to publication, as none of the new paleo- botanical evidence from Mylouthkia is mentioned in her report. The latter, together with recent evidence of plaster impressions of grains at Shillourokambos, now provide compelling (if not abundant) evidence for the introduction of cultivated plant species such as einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, hulled barley, and lentils, at c. 8500 B. C., i. e. more than a millennium earlier than Khirokitia. The final contribution in the volume, by Ofer Bar- Yosef (pp. 129-64), presents a broad overview of contemporary developments in the Levantine mainland during the late epi-Paleolithic and early Neolithic pe- riods. The focal point here is not Cyprus itself but "the source areas for its prehistoric populations," in order to characterize the "potential areas from which the colonizing groups sailed" (p. 130). A brief discussion of chronology, climate and environment of these peri- ods is followed by an overview of the Natufian (labe- led "the first non-egalitarian society in the Levant") as well as lengthy reviews of major trends of the first farming villages of the Levant (the PPNA and PPNB periods). While the information here will be "old hat" to those familiar with the cultural sequences of the epi-Paleolithic and Neolithic of the Levant, its inclu- sion here will be useful to those working in Cyprus who may be less familiar with developments further to the east. It is regrettable, however, that the new evi- dence from Cyprus has not been more fully integrated into a wider archaeological framework, either here or elsewhere in the volume (for a discussion of some of the wider implications of this research, see Peltenburg et al. 2001). A lengthier introductory chapter, or perhaps a concluding chapter by the editor tying all the new evidence together, would have been helpful. Since 1998 (the date of the symposium at Albany), the final publication of Akrotiri has appeared (Simmons 1999), and the final reports on Tenta and Mylouthkia are expected during the coming year. In addition, there is a growing body of new evidence from continuing excavations at Shillourokambos. It is hoped that future research on the early prehistory of Cyprus will be able to capitalize more extensively on the truly significant contributions now being offered by the island to the prehistory of the entire eastern Mediterranean region. This volume provides much of the detailed informa- tion necessary for a more synthetic, interpretive ac- count than has been undertaken here. Edinburgh. Diane Bolger.
