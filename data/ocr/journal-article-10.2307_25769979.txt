This is the Nietzschean method. Applied to painting it might produce extraordinary results. This is what I try to demonstrate in my pictures. ?Giorgio de Chirico, 'What the Painting of the Future Might Be" Parisian Notebooks, ca. 1911-19132 A gnarled orange barb pokes up out of its slate blue base, notched with indecipherable markings and huddled in the shadow of a lopsided red frame; an orb of emerald green perches miraculously on a tilted plank, showing off the measured loops of its intersecting parabolas; a hexagonal tube or container or incantatory object, marked?like its neighboring, flattened arrow?with strange ciphers, inches upward against a vertiginously tipped plane. Bounded by a wedge of ink-black shadow at right and a swatch of brick wall and flushed horizon at left, this narrow space appears close, yet strains upward and away. The ginger-colored ledge rears up at an angle oblique to the picture plane, climbing like a drawbridge toward a steep vanishing point, the edge of which spills over into an unseen, yawning space, abutted by the corner of a poker-faced arcade (fig. 1). What does this strange constellation of objects? pinned with gravity-defying immobility to a sharply tilted plane?propose? Does it imagine what modern commodities in a shop window would look like to an uncultured "primitive"? Or, conversely, how exotic fetishes appear to the urbane European? Do these shapes and colors suggest elaborate drafting implements, seen by a wide-eyed infant who lacks a language to describe them? Or do they instead utter some neoteric language, shared only by elect members? Does this space represent a prehistoric Creek or Roman altar, strewn with eviscerated organs, awaiting an augur? Or else pastries glimpsed in a store front, da sotto in su, by a child passing by? Do they allude to a museum display case of artifacts, of ancient utensils, or jewels? Or, conversely, to the most modish gadgets and devices in a modern European appliance shop? This swell of uncertainties unfurls in the wake of a decidedly reticent painting, The Evil Genius of a King. Giorgio de Chirico completed this canvas in Paris during the spring and summer of 1914, along with a cluster of closely related paintings, all of which share the same basic compositional premise: Still Life: Turin 1888 (spring 1914), The Sailors' Barracks (fig. 2), The General's Illness (spring-summer 1914), and Metaphysical Composition with Toys and Metaphysical Composition (summer autumn, 1914).3 These six canvases, which I shall hereforth refer to as the Evil Genius series (since this is the best known and most reproduced of the group), all figure objects with purposes that vacillate?in the shape For their perceptive comments and criticisms, I wish to thank Emily Braun, T.

If some of these objects resemble instruments of science and calculation, others appear useless. A few of the objects possess each of these qualities in equal measure. In a letter to his dealer from the fall of 1915, soon after he had left Paris for service in the Italian army, de Chirico describes these canvases simply as containing "objets indetermines"?a laconicism matched by the modest place of these paintings in the reception of Metaphysical art.4 In the entire body of scholarship on de Chirico, this group of canvases has received scant attention, despite the subsequent prominence of The Evil Genius of a King in both Dadaist and Surrealist circles between the World Wars. One consistent element of writing on the Evil Genius pictures, when they are mentioned at all, is an insistence upon their incomprehensibility. The art historian Paolo Baldacci recently remarked that the series' "iconographical elements pose formidable interpretive problems" in the form of "strange and brightly-colored objects that are extremely difficult to interpret."5 James Thrall Soby, the author of the first major monograph on de Chirico, notes the paintings' "curious objects of omen, not easily described but strangely disquieting."6 But what, exactly, is "strange" or "curious" about the objects in the Evil Genius paintings? Of what, more precisely, might they constitute omens? Indeed, is it not tautological to call these objects strange or ominous in the context of de Chirico's Metaphysical aesthetic, which expressly conjures up a world of enigma, of non-sense, of menacing disquiet? Scholars rarely, if ever, discuss de Chirico's Metaphysical paintings in connection with early twentieth century primitivism. This is due to the widespread notion that these works, which he completed mostly in Paris in the early 1910s, evoke only classical, Greco-Roman themes and settings. Indeed, de Chirico's canvases make no overt formal references to the Polynesian and African objects that so preoccupied his colleagues in avant-garde Montparnasse. Yet certain early critics discussed de Chirico's painting precisely in this vein. Maurice Raynal?one of the artist's earliest critics and a prominent voice in French avant-garde circles?ascribed de Chirico's architecture, shadows, and "unusual objects" not to Mediterranean classicism, but rather to "mythical monsters, ancient oriental divinities, negroes, characters out of fairy-tales or English novels from the nineteenth century."7 Writing in 1920, the French critic Tokine quipped acidly about de Chirico's "attempted neoprimitive constructions." He added: "But if Cubism is a discipline and not an aesthetic, this neoprimitivism?a kind of 'quasi art negre! [espece de 'petit negre' de I'art]?leaves even more to be desired."8 The art historian Maurizio Fagiolo dell'Arco rightly notes that de Chirico's work consistently "avoids the topic of art negre/'9 But avoidance does not, in this instance, constitute unconcern. De Chirico's stance vis-a-vis avant-garde primitivism and art negre was not one of mere indifference, but rather of calculated and subtle distancing, particularly after his arrival in France, where he could not have escaped an encounter with these artifacts. While he claimed a divergence between his work and his peers' primitivist tendencies, the era's criticism suggests that this constituted a narcissism of small difference?or, to invokeTokine's patronizing terminology, a "petit negre" of art, rather than its full fledged version. Classical and primitive themes are not, as has long been assumed, mutually exclusive in de Chirico's early Metaphysical painting; rather these form two sides of the same coin, particularly with regard to de Chirico's evocation of objects as sources of revelatory, mythical, and divinatory power. More specifically, de Chirico used ancient and prehistoric ritual practices as the model for his depiction of objects. I hope to shed some light on how de Chirico pursued these strategies, particularly with the Evil Genius, mining the Greco-Roman tradition for its own origins in mystery and irrationality. To this end he turned?quite self consciously and declaratively?to the writings of his imagined mentor, Friedrich Nietzsche. 4.

Or, rather, it was precisely the ostensible familiarity of this world?of its instruments and objects, its architecture and commonplaces?that afforded a covert fetishizing by the philosopher-genius. It is this Greece, Ernst Bertram writes, that represented for Nietzsche "a secret, interior Orient/'10 As a Greek-born Italian, de Chirico believed himself to possess a privileged relationship to the classical past and felt directly interpellated by Nietzsche's call for the "perversion" of antiquarian studies.11 As is now patent in scholarship, from Soby's first monograph up through Paolo Baldacci's more comprehensive studies, de Chirico's early encounter with the works of Nietzsche informs the entire trajectory of his Metaphysical project.12 Despite mounting recognition of de Chirico's debts to Nietzsche, we lack a close reading of precisely how de Chirico applied Nietzsche's philosophy to painting. Along these lines, I argue here for certain aspects of form, composition, and even color in the Evil Genius paintings as deriving from Nietzsche's writings on pre-Socratic Hellenism, myth, and ritual. De Chirico and avant-garde Primitivism: Affinities and resistances "Intellectual appetites glutted themselves on little specialized menus: I even recall the drunkenness of art negre that seized?ante bellum?Parisian moderns after copious mythical meals."13 Definitively settled in Italy after serving in the Italian army abroad, de Chirico's brother and collaborator, Alberto Savinio (ne Andrea de Chirico), eagerly downplayed his and Giorgio's participation in the more fashionable aspects of French modernism before the Great War. De Chirico's later attempts to disassociate his work from the prewar, Parisian avant-gardes?and their uses of primitivist sculpture?were no less emphatic than his brother's. It is telling, however, that de Chirico's young art dealer was none other than Paul Guillaume. As early as 1912, Guillaume had amassed a large collection of African sculpture and founded the Societe des Melanophiles in 1913 to further its study and promulgation. In Guillaume's own words, by 1918 his gallery boasted "la collection la plus importante, la plus riche et la plus belle des statues negres" in Paris, and perhaps all of Europe.14 De Chirico's close confidant, the prominent poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire, was himself an early collector and enthusiast of primitive sculpture, even penning essays such as Melanophilie ou melanomanie, and the volume Sculptures negres in 1917, partly to promote Guillaume's enterprise in this area. As the Gallerie Guillaume gained prominence in the mid-191 Os, de Chirico's work was frequently displayed there alongside African and Oceanic artifacts, in addition to paintings by Andre Derain, Amadeo Modigliani, and Pablo Picasso?artists who expressly engaged with the aesthetics of primitivism.15 Guillaume even sent de Chirico's The General's Illness (one of the Evil Genius series) and four other Metaphysical works to Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery for inclusion in the landmark exhibition, Statuary in Wood by African Savages: The Root of Modern Art (November 3-December 8, 1914). Savinio, too, participated in absentia, recording on Pathe disc a lecture on art negre, which was played in conjunction with the exhibition (fig. 3).16 Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Guillaume made pronouncements such as: "It will be the glory of a few men endowed with certain prophetic vision to have 10.

Recent archival discoveries now afford a closer consideration of these conceptions, of their etiology and implications. Gerd Roos's unearthing of a note written by de Chirico in January 1911 has brought to light previously undisclosed aspects of de Chirico's "primitivist" interests, which manifested themselves from the very start of his Metaphysical pursuits, during his student days in Munich from 1906-1909.18 On the back of a musical program by Savinio?which de Chirico translated from Italian to German and sent to his friend Fritz Gartz in Munich?de Chirico has scribbled the names of various scholars of non-European cultures and anthropologists of religion, as well as various related words, including "mythical history . . . Zend?Avesta / Zarathustra."19 Roos suggests that this list?dashed off without clear order?was probably not intended for Gartz, but was written by de Chirico for himself, though it remains unclear to what end. Listing, among others, the Scottish theologian and scholar of Hebrew William Robertson Smith (1846-1894), the Indologist Hermann Oldenberg (1854-1920), and the Egyptologist and author of Histoire ancienne de peuples de {'orient (1875) Gaston Camille Charles Maspero (1846-1916), de Chirico's note forms a veritable inventory of contemporary scholarship on Semitic and non-Western philology and anthropology.20 17.

A photocopy of this note is reproduced in Roos (ibid.), between pages 16 and 17. 20. Baldacci rightly notes the importance of such a document in comprehending de Chirico's early intellectual formation. De Chirico's burgeoning interest in Nietzsche and Schopenhauer seems to have extended also to include some of the Eastern theories of myth and religion that informed these philosophers' antirationalist imperatives</page><page sequence="7">192 RES 57/58 SPRING/AUTUMN 2010 As I will discuss in detail, de Chirico's main "primitivist" sympathies remained with the more rarefied realm of Nietzschean and pre-Socratic texts. Rather than a prefiguration of certain discourses on primitivism and non-Western cultures, de Chirico's familiarity with these trends evidences his work's contiguity with avant-garde experiments and undermines the received notion of de Chirico's paintings as rooted in a matrix of straightforward classicism. I would contend that this aspect of de Chirico's cultural formation, at once parallel to and bound up with his readings of Nietzsche, locates de Chirico more fixedly in the intellectual climate of his time, rather than signals his distance from or anticipation of it. If de Chirico resisted the vogue of Parisian primitivism, his canvases from this period are no less concerned with enlisting a kind of atavism in the service of modern painting?however self-consciously untoward and untimely. Just as his oeuvre at large argues for strangeness and enigma as immanent to the ordinary physical environment, these pictures insist upon the non-sense at the heart of the?seemingly familiar? Greco-Roman tradition. It is precisely due to its superficial familiarity?its embeddedness in a presumably classical world?that de Chirico's Nietzschean primitivism has gone largely unaddressed. Nietzsche, Heraclitus, and the language of oracle Speculating on the genealogy of the Evil Genius paintings, James Thrall Soby remarks: "In 1914 [de Chirico] added cryptic objects [to his paintings], seen or imagined on his solitary walks through the streets of Paris."21 Yet as Wieland Schmied and Paolo Baldacci have demonstrated in separate studies, de Chirico's paintings from 1914 expressly conjure up Nietzsche's sojourns in Turin?a presence that de Chirico famously interpreted as a fated prefiguration of his own later presence in that city.22 He came increasingly to identify with Nietzsche in ways both intellectual and psychopathological, even half-jokingly claiming to be the philosopher's metempsychotic reincarnation?a notion that their similar stomach illnesses and migraines, along with their elective exiles in various lands, seemed to confirm. Already in 1910, writing from Florence to his friend Fritz Gartz in Munich, de Chirico declares: "I will now whisper something in your ear: I am the only man to have truly understood Nietsche [sic]?all of my work demonstrates this."23 Subsequent declarations confirmed?along with his burgeoning iconographical changes?that such an affinity was not merely a passing diversion, but the source of a wholesale aesthetic and existential conversion. "It is only with Nietzsche that I can say I have begun a real life," he writes in a later letter.24 Even by 1914 this initiation had done anything but subside. De Chirico's poster for the Paul Guillaume Gallery?since titled The Enigma of the Horse (1914)?depicts a rearing horse in the shadow of one of his trademark arcades. Completed just months before the Evil Genius canvases, the image alludes to the famous episode in which Nietzsche clutched a horse in the streets of Turin as it was beaten by its master. (The "Zend?Avesta / Zarathustra" pairing is a case in point). But I think Baldacci slightly overstates the consequence of de Chirico's list of scrawled names, claiming that it prefigures later avant-garde trends and reveals "that Metaphysical art anticipated many of the discoveries of linguistics and semiology, sociology and structuralism, and the philosophy of symbolic form. Only an extremely small number of European thinkers had arrived at the point of being able to completely overturn basic cultural assumptions, still mired during those years in the conflict between idealism and positivism" (Baldacci [see note 5], p. 90). Whatever de Chirico's level of familiarity with the authors mentioned?which appears to have been quite superficial?his application of their work cannot have constituted an overturning of "basic cultural assumptions," much less linguistic or semiotic ones. More fundamentally, we do not even know, as Gerd Roos notes, if this impromptu list names books "already read or to be read," though de Chirico likely consulted at least some of the books in subsequent years and was certainly familiar with Reinach's work.

The date of this letter has become the subject of profound, ongoing polemics within de Chirico scholarship.

In another vein, from de Chirico's extant letters to Gartz, originally brought to light by Gerd Roos, we know for certain that by the summer of 1909 Giorgio and his brother Alberto had read at least Ecce Homo and 77?tvs Spoke Zarathustra, in addition to French translations of The Birth of Tragedy, The Case of Wagner, and probably The Gay Science.

But iconographic and biographic cues get us only so far in reading these images. As with the Metaphysical images at large, a close reading of the Evil Genius works reveals that de Chirico does not translate Nietzsche's philosophy into some esoteric iconography, but rather into a pictorial language that is itself esoteric. Only months after he had completed the Evil Genius paintings, de Chirico wrote to his dealer in Paris: In order to thrill to such metaphysical things, so to speak, you must, my dear friend, possess a rare intelligence, very rare?for, the more people I meet, the more I realize that this God-given gift is an uncommon thing; I even think that intelligence as we others understand it?Nietzschean intelligence [^intelligence nietzschienne]?the intelligence of God and of the acrobat, of the hero and the beast, is so rare as to be nearly unobtainable, and we who have been entranced by the gleam of the sky, we who see?we can be proud and happy, since joy, sweet and divine joy, is our due, whatever the destiny of our lives. So be it.25 What de Chirico deems "I'intelligence nietzschienne" is not a set of objects or images, anecdotes or events. It is a way of seeing?or re-seeing?the world. The Evil Genius paintings propose the merging of de Chirico's own subjectivity not only with Nietzsche's, but also with that of Nietzsche's own imagined mentor, the pre-Socratic philosopher, Heraclitus. De Chirico's first truly Metaphysical painting, The Enigma of the Oracle (summer-autumn, 1909), as well as an early drawing by Savinio, both allude to the image of Heraclitus, wrapped in a chlamys and framed by architecture against the sky (fig. 4). Like his paintings, de Chirico's earliest writings reveal a profound interest in aspects of preclassical Hellenism, sparked by Nietzsche's extensive references to Heraclitus and other pre-Socratic philosophers. In his first Parisian manuscript, de Chirico figures the world of enigmatic, preclassical antiquity as a realm tantamount to the solemnity and silence of earth's prehistory. He imagines "those soothsayers tending to the voice of the waves receding from that ancient land. I have pictured them head and body wrapped in a chlamys, waiting for the mysterious revealing oracle. So I also once imagined the Ephesian [Heraclitus] meditating in the first light of dawn under the peristyle of the Temple of Artemis of the hundred breasts."26 De Chirico's interest 25.

Heraclitus's enigmatic, terse fragments?which praised silence and enigma over pedantic garrulity?attracted Nietzsche and de Chirico in turn.27 Ancient accounts of Heraclitus's elitism, anti-social behavior, and willful estrangement from his contemporaries further enhanced his appeal. While The Evil Genius of a King aspires to evoke a solemnity and solitude similar to that in The Enigma of the Oracle?a world of mystery, ritual, and revelation? the dimensions of the scene have shifted: from a demonstrably ancient scene, to one less transparent in its temporality. The Evil Genius of a King evokes not (only) a remote and secret oracle, but (also) the contents of a shop window. With?quite literally?pedestrian aplomb, the Evil Genius paintings take the language of oracular painting to new heights, even as it brings it down to the level of the street. De Chirico's entire Metaphysical corpus is bound up with tropes of prophecy, augury, and divination: from the "oracles" of his earliest paintings, to his depictions of Roman augurs' staffs in several canvases, to his evocation of "Soothsayers" and "Seers" in later works. With the Evil Genius series, these tropes become focused in and on ambiguous objects: vaguely grounded in ancient vatic ritual, but impossible to tell apart from modern commodities. Toys and templums The Metaphysical Composition with Toys (summer autumn 1914) and The General's Illness offer a number of parallels with The Evil Genius of a King in this regard?parallels that bear upon the series as a whole. The objects in the former two pictures represent the most biomorphic, oddly shaped figures to appear in de Chirico's oeuvre. Until this point in his corpus, de Chirico had evoked a sense of strangeness only by setting familiar objects in jarring juxtaposition?whether a bust of Jupiter alongside a cluster of bananas, or a cannon and two artichokes, or a modern clock face in the same space as an ancient galley. In The General's Illness and Metaphysical Composition with Toys, however, not only the objects' relationships to one another appear incongruous or unfathomable, but their very identity and purpose are also indecipherable, vacillating between the status of playthings and more ceremonious objects, such as the entrails read by ancient augurs.28 As Maurizio Calvesi has demonstrated, de Chirico's curiosity for the rituals of augury was sharpened by the contemporary novel La fin de Babylone (1914), penned by his early champion and confidant Apollinaire. Some of Apollinaire's references to the arcane objects of ancient divination appear in de Chirico's canvases from this same period, such as the "divinatory arrow" in the Evil Genius of a King and other strange objects in The General's Illness and Metaphysical Composition with Toys.29 The isolated objects in these works seem to further derive from the second-century-B.c. Etruscan bronze sculpture of a sheep liver ("The Piacenza Liver"), a teaching tool, which Etruscan augurs used to demonstrate their procedures to initiates (fig. 5). The lumpy shape at left, in particular, is notched with markings similar to those that appear on the barbed and bulbous "Piacenza Liver," which de Chirico likely saw in reproduction.30 Like The General's Illness, The Evil Genius of a King contains objects with similar markings, inscribed on flattened shapes. The Piacenza bronze liver is divided into quadrants corresponding to the movements of celestial bodies.

One of Savinio's musical compositions dated December 29, 1914, is titled Les visceres oeuilles [sic].

As I argue below, however, de Chirico's Evil Genius series cannot be ascribed solely to a visual transcription of Apollinaire's text. It is equally bound up with de Chirico's other interests in Nietzsche, European pre- and proto-history, and even the work of his brother, Savinio. 30.

After submitting my dissertation in May of 2006 and having proposed the Piacenza sculpture as a potential source of the Evil Genius series, I was alerted to Calvesi's essay, which sets forth a similar proposal regarding the Piacenza bronze. Calvesi relates the object only to The Evil Genius; while this general assimilation seems certain, certain objects in The General's Illness and Metaphysical Composition with Toys echo more pointedly the forms and markings of the Piacenza bronze.</page><page sequence="10">Merjian: Untimely objects 195 Figure 5.

Museo Civico, Piacenza. writings and paintings frequently evoke Babylonia and Chaldea as admirable manifestations of pre Hellenic tradition. Like its Babylonian, Hittite, and Chaldean precedents and like its Greek and Roman contemporaries, Etruscan religion viewed the body's organs as condensations and reflections of cosmological order.31 Various objects extant in Etruscan and Roman archaeology depict priests in the act of augury, bent over an altar or slab on which viscerae have been placed. A bronze mirror from the Vatican Museum's Etruscan collection, for example, reveals Calchus?a winged priest of Apollo?engaged in this act of extispicy (the examination of animal entrails), or hepatoscopy, or hepatomancy (divination using the liver of sacrificial animals.)32 De Chirico and Savinio's interest in the Etruscans? like their attraction to Babylonian, Chaldean, and, later, Jewish cultures?was rather dilettantish. But the affinities between these cultures and "Greek prehistory" led to occasional invocation in their paintings and writings, specifically in the context of de Chirico's decidedly urban revelations. A poem from his early Parisian manuscripts (1911-1913) reads: "One day I too will be a man-statue / widowed husband on an Etruscan sarcophagus / that day in your great grip of stone /hug me, O mother city/'33 In his later meditation on the funerary tumuli of Etrurian cities such as Cerveteri and Tarquinia, Savinio writes of the Etruscans as "[g]reat psychologists of death."34 He also likens the disparity between Rome and Etruria to the difference "between logicians and metaphysicians"35?a contrast that, by the 1940s, aims to favor Roman logic (written at the height of Fascism, Savinio's text makes various rhetorical concessions to the regime's chauvinism). Still, his description of Etrurian religion in terms of "cruelty and malignity ... a taste for the absurd, distortion of reality, reversal of values,"36 suggests why it would have appealed to de Chirico's pursuit of "evil genius" in the 31.

That Savinio rehearses Etrurian culture in decidedly Nietzschean terms?the flaunting of logic, the transvaluation of values, a kind of "evil"?is by no means coincidental. From his earliest published works, such as The Birth of Tragedy up through his last anti-Wagnerian polemics, Nietzsche championed the "underbelly" of Hellenism: "the good, severe will of the older Greeks to pessimism, to the tragic myth, to the image of everything underlying existence that is frightful, evil, a riddle, destructive, fatal?"37 The confluence of evil and a riddling fatality in Nietzsche's rhetoric underscores the extent to which such language appealed to de Chirico's burgeoning conceptions of an alternative Hellenism. The Evil Genius of a King surely resonates expressly with Nietzsche's notion of "evil" as the domain of the ubermenschian artist-philosopher?a notion threaded insistently throughout Nietzsche's entire oeuvre. In Zarathustra alone it rears up on nearly every other page as the benchmark of the transvaluation of values: "[T]here is yet a future for evil too/'38 Even aside from these more abstract concepts, Nietzsche specifically discusses?and esteems?the sacrificial and mystical practices of Greek and Roman societies. Daybreak, for example, addresses the framing and isolating of religious objects by the Greeks, while Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense discusses the practices bound up with objects such as the Piacenza liver: "the Romans and the Etruscans cut up the heavens with rigid mathematical lines and confined a god within each of these spaces thereby delimited, as within a tempi urn/'39 In the same vein, in a passage titled "On 37.

Bardi/de Chirico declares that during his Metaphysical period, "he had discovered an enigmatic Greece quite different from the Greece illustrated in schoolbooks, just as, after reading Nietzsche's Ecce Homo, [he] set about discovering the 'mystery of Italy' ['le mystere italien']."42 De Chirico's early paintings, completed during his residencies in Munich and Milan, had pictured a Mediterranean world of savage, mythical battles. His Battle of Centaurs (1909) treats a theme from the annals of his native Thessaly, namely, that of the clash between the Centaurs and Lapiths (fig. 7).43 To Arnold Bocklin's mythological subject matter and brooding style, de Chirico has added even more frenzied brushwork and placed the grim detail of skulls at the left corner of the skirmish. His earlier Sphinx (1908-1909) depicts a seashore littered with skulls and bones, awash in the wake of a plainly unforgiving riddler, whose profile juts proudly from the cliff walls. Taking up the thread of Thessalian myth, specifically that of his birthplace, Volos, Greece? ancient lolchos, from which Jason and the Argonauts set sail in search of the Golden Fleece?de Chirico's Departure of the Argonauts (summer 1909) reveals a slaughtered lamb or goat laid at the feet of a statue of Athena, a propitiatory sacrifice to the goddess in advance of the Argos's departure. As "Bardi"'s account attests, de Chirico's interest in these aspects of Hellenic mythology deepened as he and Savinio moved across Europe?from Munich, to Milan, to Florence, to Paris?and as their readings of Nietzsche came to inform their work more comprehensively. The brothers eventually coauthored a musical score entitled The Most Profound Music Ever Written: Revelations on the "Enigma of the Eternal Return" (This concert, scheduled for a performance in Florence on January 9, 1911, was never held.44) One subtitle of this work is "The Passage of the Pelasgians"? referring to the mythical inhabitants of the pre-Hellenic Aegean. To be sure, de Chirico's imaginings of the ancient Greco-Roman world as "enigmatique," mysterious, and violent must have derived, in part, from sources other than Ecce Homo.45 We know for certain that de Chirico consulted Salomon Reinach's manuals, including Apollo: An Illustrated Manual of the History of Art through the Ages, for reproductions. De Chirico seems to have gleaned from Reinach's books not only a model for his Ariadne figures, but also references to xoana (proto Archaic statues), Etruscan sarcophagi, and prehistoric grottoes, as well as the Chaldean sculpture of The Architect with the Rule (which appears, slightly altered, in The Disquieting Muses). I do not argue that de Chirico set out to isolate any of these sources as the exclusive basis for a self-consciously primitivist modernism. More interesting and important, I think, is the way in which he weaves them into generic tropes of "Greek prehistory" and "strangely Roman poetry"?terms that appear in his earliest Parisian notebooks and which form the was published posthumously), numerous other writings by Nietzsche allude to rituals of ancient Greek sacrifice, astronomy, and Heraclitus? all of which, as I will discuss, de Chirico noted and incorporated in his writings and paintings. 40.

His comparative method discerns "a striking resemblance between the rude oracles of the Polynesians, and those of the celebrated nations of ancient Greece/' In his scrutiny of "savage" beliefs about death, superstition, healing, and taboos, Frazer treats the Roman augur's staff, the Athenian Dionysian festivals, and the funerary rights of the Pidhireanes in the same breath. It is uncertain whether or not de Chirico read Frazer's books. See J. G.

Nietzsche's writings encouraged de Chirico's evocation of Greek myth as something that haunts the modern world to its very marrow, though visible only to those endowed with the vision to see it.46 Ridendo dicere severum: Color, form, and affect in the Evil Genius paintings "Why should we attribute to the ancient Greeks an immunity from 'primitive' modes of thought?" asks E. R. Dodds in The Greeks and the Irrational (1951). Dodds's query had, of course, long been anticipated by Nietzsche's philosophy. From his very first writings, Nietzsche assailed the prevalent notion of Greek culture as the birthplace of rationalism. "[A]s if there had never been a sixth century with its birth of tragedy, its mysteries, its Pythagoras and Heraclitus, as if the 46.

"The best German cultural figures," he adds, have "learned best to come to terms with the Greeks ... by skeptically abandoning the Hellenic ideal and completely perverting the true purpose of antiquarian studies."48 "We are not afraid of the reverse side of 'good things' . . . e.g. of Hellenism, of morality, of reason" he later vows in The Will to Power.49 Such pronouncements echoed similar recuperations of the long-abjured "underbelly" of classicism that took place in the realm of art history and archaeology. The early nineteenth-century rediscovery of the paint that once adorned classical temples formed a physical counterpart and forerunner of Nietzsche's philological diggings.

J. Winckelmann's Greek ideal. But de Chirico's Metaphysical paintings held out against eccentric coloration and formal distortion as the means to suggest enigma and mystery. He viewed this as too facile a strategy, equivalent, for example, to Gabriele D'Annunzio's florid and rhetorical neoclassicism. As the Metaphysical aesthetic evolved into a clear, architectonic construction of crisp forms and lines, the loose, "Dionysian" strokes of de Chirico's first Centaur and Sphinx canvases became tamer and drier. The Enigma of the Oracle, his first categorically Metaphysical work, reveals a decidedly muted palette and architectural solidity. Though Delacroix's throbbing surfaces and rich coloration would return as a model for de Chirico's painting during the 1940s, the young de Chirico condemned both Delacroix's "disregard for [linear] construction" [negligenza del disegno] and his "oriental influences" as late as 1920.50 Like Nietzsche, de Chirico sought to exploit Romanticism's affect (solemnity, wildly vacillating emotions, pathos, gravitas), while rejecting the Romantics' effects (vague mistiness, lachrymose histrionics, the evocation of indeterminacy as a condition of surface). De Chirico avoided vibrant colors so much, in fact, that Apollinaire gently rebuked him in the French press, in October of 1913: "I must add that Monsieur de Chirico's color is too somber, evoking the hue of ponds covered in dead leaves, and these enigmas would gain much from being rendered in happier colors."51 It is surely no coincidence that with the Evil Genius canvases, which he completed soon after, de Chirico moves decidedly away from the drab tones of his previous works?from The Sphinx and The Procession up a Mountain (summer-autumn 1909), up through The Enigma of Arrival (winter 1911-1912). Early in 1914?just months after Apollinaire's critique?de Chirico's The Philosopher's Conquest emerged as his most vibrant image to date, with a ground of gingery orange set off against a red silo and brick tower, and a sky of "Veronese green" that had already become a staple of the Metaphysical canvas. The Evil Genius of a King surpasses even The Philosopher's Conquest in its use of bright tones. In fact, almost all of the small objects in the Evil Genius series are vividly tinted. Apollinaire's suggestion may have influenced him. But de Chirico's study of Nietzsche also surely informed the increased vibrancy of The Evil Genius?a vibrancy subtly coded in its applications and evocations. In a 1935 essay de Chirico discusses the debt of his 1912-1915 paintings "to Friedrich Nietzsche, whom I read passionately at the time": His Ecce Homo, written in Turin shortly before he succumbed to madness, greatly helped me to understand the city's peculiar beauty. The best season for Turin, the one that lets its metaphysical charm show through most clearly, is autumn. This autumn has nothing in common with the autumn of the Romantics, with cloud-laden skies and dead leaves and departing swallows.... Autumn, as it revealed Turin to me and as Turin revealed it to me, is joyful, although certainly not in a gaudy, dazzling way. It is something huge, at once near and distant; a great peacefulness, great purity, rather closely related to the joy felt by a convalescent finally cured of a long and painful illness.52 Joyful, but not gaudy; charming, but not dazzling. De Chirico has internalized Apollinaire's disapproval of "dead leaves" and suggests that his Metaphysical works avoided just such an evocation. The cloud-laden skies of his own earliest paintings evaporate to reveal sun-baked, limpid lines. In the Evil Genius works, Turin's autumnal Stimmung?a season of death, of Nietzsche's madness falling like twilight?appears instead bright and jubilant, at least to the discerning observer: "This [Turin's] autumn is made for the 'happy few,'" de Chirico writes.53 Nietzsche had famously turned Heraclitus?long deemed "The Crying Philosopher" for his supposedly nihilistic observations?into a different kind of prophet, whose solitary pain could be transmuted into the delectation of individual genius. In their mounting insanity, Nietzsche's own late writings conjure up aspects of the pre-Socratic world that so long held him in thrall: an ecstasy and exhilaration in the embrace of tragedy. Numerous writers, from Pierre Klossowski to R. J. Hollingdale, have characterized Nietzsche's growing psychosis as a "pathological euphoria."54 Already in the epigraph to "The Case of Wagner"?"Ridendo dicefre] severum" ["Through what is laughable say what is 50.

Of course, in his earliest works, Nietzsche intoned against the (Goethian and Winckelmannian) notion of "Greek cheerfulness." But after his break with Wagner and Schopenhauerian thought, he came to increasingly campaign against the dour portentousness of Romanticism, insisting that art must be "cheerful," "gay," and "frivolous" in order to be profound. For Nietzsche as for de Chirico after him, the profundity of myth was inseparable from its (apparent) opposite: joy and joyfulness, a will to form, an exultance in life.56 The Evil Genius canvases incorporate this paradoxical effect in various ways. The "pessimism" and "shock" that de Chirico claims to have withstood during these years become mixed, in the Evil Genius pictures, with their respective opposites: a certain frivolity, on the one hand, and a blase, protracted stillness on the other. Human, All Too Human argues that the ancient world's admixture of opposite ideals would escape the comprehension of most modern subjects?"the sensibility that this is a possible mixture is vanishing," he writes. Only Heraclitus, Nietzsche, and their ilk now possess the acumen to recognize the "combination of farce, even obscenity, with religious feeling ... the sublime in league with the burlesque, the sentimental blended with the ludicrous."57 That such an argument arises from Nietzsche's reflections "on viewing certain ancient sacrificial utensils" reveals again the proximity of de Chirico's project to Nietzsche's?especially the attempt to resuscitate a vanished sensibility as the tool of an elite few. The funereal gravitas of the Evil Genius paintings is bound inseparably to their affective obverse. If de Chirico sought to avoid the "Greek cheerfulness" of so much insipid neoclassicism, so too did his paintings increasingly shun the morbid bathos of Romantic and Symbolist histrionics. His early Battle of Centaurs is unabashed in its inclusion of lumps of flesh, pools of blood. By the time of Metaphysical Composition with Toys and The Evil Genius of a King, however, the horrible image of flesh and limbs torn out during Dionysian mysteries is only implicit. Furthermore, this dour reference is now visually embedded within its opposite: toys, playthings. Painting inhumanism, spring-autumn 1914 Not only early works like The Birth of Tragedy and Human, All Too Human, but even Nietzsche's later, anti-Wagnerian texts propose a return to long-obscured aspects of Hellenic antiquity as the only way forward?a trajectory that rounds back on itself with the stubborn circularity of the Eternal Return: "the digging up of ancient philosophy, above all the pre-Socratics?the most deeply buried of all Greek temples! . . . Today we are getting close to all those fundamental forms of world interpretation devised by the Greek spirit through Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Democritus, and Anaxagoras ... at first, as is only fair, in concepts and evaluations, as Hellenizing ghosts, as it were: but one day, let us hope, also in our bodies!"58 It is significant that Nietzsche figures his reclamation of pre-Socratic philosophy?here and in other writings?as both the excavation of a buried temple and a corporeal transmutation. For, particularly after Winckelmann and the rise of Neoclassicism, the principles of classicism had come to be visually metaphorized and idealized in Greek and Roman architecture and sculpture. Furthermore, this twin ideal perpetuated itself through the notion of an architecture whose scale both derived from and epitomized the canons of the human form. By one early twentieth-century account: "The architecture of humanism rose in Greece; and of the Greeks it has been said that they first made man 'at home in the world.' Their thought was anthropocentric: so also was their architecture."59 This passage, from Geoffrey Scott's The Architecture of Humanism: A Study in the History of Taste (1914)?published the year that de Chirico painted the Evil Genius series?illustrates a prevalent strain of contemporary European thought, one that took for granted a wholesome correspondence between physical proportion and moral rectitude, between the body and 55. This is Walter Kaufmann's translation; see Nietzsche, The Case of Wagner, in Basic Writings of Nietzsche (note 1), p. 609, fn. 1. Kaufmann further notes that this is a variation of a dictum by Horace (whom de Chirico invokes in his earliest manuscripts): "ridentem dicere verum, quid vetat" ("What forbids us to tell the truth, laughing?") from Satires 1.24. 56. "I know an Italian spirit," de Chirico writes, "that is sad, even in its joy, and more profound in its joy than in its sadness, I know a classical Italian nature which is languid and adventurous, and in which I find elements of every country of the world: from the clear, immobile beauty of ancient Greece to the demons of Africa and of the North."

Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks sets its sights against "our era, infected with the biographical plague . . . indulging in a highly anthropomorphic metaphor/'61 The Gay Science intones against the drive to "naturalize" humanity, against "order, arrangement, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms."62 Whereas humanist logic argues that beauty inheres naturally to classical architecture, such that architecture stands as the canon of aesthetics, Nietzsche deflates this reasoning with withering corporeal (and misogynist) metaphors: "What does the beauty of a building mean to us now? The same as the beautiful face of a mindless woman: something mask-like."63 De Chirico's writings from 1911-1919 assail anthropomorphism as one of the most egregious philosophical and aesthetic commonplaces?one that Metaphysical painting endeavors to undermine. "Thus religion and philosophy are like two symbols of what we call the universe in general," de Chirico writes in his Parisian manuscripts. "We believe in religion, we believe in philosophy, but we don't believe in these two eternal nemeses having a human crust [croute humaine]."64 Again and again, de Chirico seeks to pry apart painting from its parasitical codependence upon the commonplaces of humanism and its corporeal counterparts. In fact, nearly all of de Chirico's earliest writings assimilate Nietzsche's call to "overcome man" as one of their main leitmotifs. De Chirico writes in these same Paris notebooks that after reading Nietzsche and traveling to Rome, "My imagination no longer bore any subjects."65 He insists upon painting's new vocation as the stripping "of everything routine and accepted, and of all subject matter... to suppress completely man as guide, or as a means to express symbol, sensation or thought."66 This stripping of "subjects"?whether in the anecdotal sense of subject matter, or the sense of human individuality?occurs increasingly as de Chirico's painting progresses away from Bocklin's example. The deliberate eviction of the human from his scenes after 1912?as the Metaphysical venture gathered momentum?seems to have sprung in equal parts from a close study of Nietzsche, and, as we shall see, some particular strains in the history of painting and archaeology. Antediluvian/posthuman: Edouard Riou and Hans Holbein the Younger's Portrait of Nicolas Kratzer In his essay "On Metaphysical Art," de Chirico recalls being impressed as a child by Louis Figuier's book, La terre ay ant le deluge, illustrated by Edouard Riou (fig. 8). Figuier's books, from La terre avant le deluge to Merveilles de la Science, documented a range of landscapes, objects, and technologies, illustrated in ways similar to Jules Verne's popular narratives (particular favorites of de Chirico's). This affinity is not coincidental given the fact that Riou (a student of Daubigny and Gustave Dore) also provided the plates for Verne's Cinq Semaines en Ballon (Hetzel, 1863) and Voyage de la terre a la lune (Hetzel, 1867), among other books. Reedited several times throughout the end of the nineteenth century, La terre avant le deluge features various plates of "vues ideales": brachiopods hauling themselves ashore out of the primal slough; amphibian ancestors poking their noses out of swamps draped with giant ferns; skies split with lightning, roiled with billowing storm clouds. The plate that de Chirico remembers in particular "represented a landscape of the Tertiary period. Man was not yet present. I have often meditated upon the strange phenomenon of this absence of human beings in its metaphysical aspect."67 As de Chirico's comments indicate, Riou's pictures make possible a figurative world without human figures. De Chirico's proposed return "back along the path of a millennial art" thus revisits not only Trecento and Quattrocento "primitives," not only the caves of the pre verbal troglodyte, but even a geological primitivism?a world prior to human inhabitation.68 In this same essay, de Chirico links Figuier and Riou's antediluvian histories to landscapes of a different sort.

Absence of humanity in man/'69 Indeed, the formal and compositional fundaments of Riou's landscapes bear striking similarities to Poussin and Claude's works, for instance, in the framing of a central scene by cou7/sse-like trees, or a prominent foreground that gives way to a meandering spatial recession reminiscent of Baroque landscapes?a fact not altogether surprising given Riou's formation in French Salons. In Poussin's Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe (1651) or Winter: The Flood (1660-1664; Louvre), even the lightning that tears silver seams in the sky resonates later in Riou's stormy rendering of Permian prehistory (fig. 9). Though Poussin's foregrounds proffer human forms instead of primeval ones, his originary flood conveys its Biblical solemnity through an austere economy of space. The human body in these landscapes is wholly subjected to?or prostrated before, dwarfed by?the physical environment. The sight of Poussin's and Claude's canvases, which de Chirico studied closely at the Louvre during his years in Paris, must have resonated with his childhood recollections of La terre avant le deluge. Another picture from the Louvre seems to have informed the making of The Evil Genius of a King even more pointedly: Hans Holbein the Younger's Portrait of Nicolas Kratzer (1528) (fig. 10). De Chirico briefly mentions this work in his essay "Reflections on Ancient Painting" in which he expounds at length on the architectonic nature of Poussin's and Claude's works. The essay was published in // Convegno, in 1921, by the time de Chirico was back in Italy, suggesting that he had seen and studied Holbein's painting during his 1911-1915 residency in Paris. Holbein's portrait of Kratzer, de Chirico writes, has "pushed [sentiment] to its limits with architectural detail ... in which the figure surrounded by the lines of the walls and the shelf, by the geometric precision of the T-squares, compasses, rulers and sextants, assumes the fantastic aspect of an apparition."70 This compositional formula?of an invasive foreground set off against a neatly framed recession into the distance?characterizes many of de Chirico's experiments in self-portraiture from the early 1920s. We find a partial anticipation of this spatial construction not only in The Child's Brain (winter-summer 1914), but also in the contemporary Evil Genius. In the latter image Figure 10.

Erich Lessing/Art Resource, New York. and its related works, however, even the human aspect of spectrality?whether that of Nicolas Kratzer, Durer, or the looming, ashen body of the artist's deceased father? is conspicuously absent. The apparition of Kratzer's body has been eclipsed by the tools of his trade. The sole subject of these paintings is a group of inanimate objects. Look at Evil Genius's long, hexagonal object, just above the green ball. Its shape clearly echoes the ten-sided sundial that Kratzer grips with his left hand. (A similar sundial also appears in Holbein's The Ambassadors [1533; fig. 11 ]). The nearest surface of The Evil Genius's tapered object is similarly marked in the center. Its sides are likewise striated with various ciphers, albeit more cryptic than Kratzer's numbered integers. If one looks at this object along with its two small, neighboring balls and antennaed head, the Evil Genius's object can also be seen as a caterpillar-like creature. 69. Ibid. 70.

Hans Holbein the Younger, The Ambassadors. Oil on oak panel, 207 x 209 cm. National Gallery, London/Art Resource, New York. This droll (and perhaps awkwardly erotic) transformation seems almost to defuse the solemnity of the ciphers that cover the surface of these objects. They may be simultaneously read, in other words, as nonsensical gizmos as much as scientific contraptions. The barbed object at the canvas's bottom left similarly vacillates between a child's spinning top and something more serious?even sinister?lurking in a crook of shadow, yet clearly illuminated. This object might be partly derived from an Egyptian sun clock, perhaps seen in illustrated histories of Pharaonic religion, again relating to de Chirico's interest in Near Eastern astrology. The General's Illness and The Sailors' Barracks also reveal objects that are indistinguishable as either toys or tools: a pointed, egg-like thing; a miniature checkerboard; a piece of paper folded into a diminutive tent; balls and wands; a scroll or stone volute; and other items that elude definition or description. That de Chirico's father, Evaristo, studied engineering in Turin adds a further layer of meaning to the Evil Genius series. The objects in The Evil Genius of a King, like those in de Chirico's "Ferrarese interiors" that follow shortly after, conjure the tools that lay around his father's workshops in Athens and Volos?just as they are sprawled across Nicolas Kratzer's workspace in Holbein's picture. In the Evil Genius pictures, instruments are bound up not with exacting measurements, but rather an aura of magic and marvel. If Nicholas Kratzer suddenly left his post on Holbein's canvas, we would be left with something akin to what we find in The Evil Genius of a King: mere things, solitary and isolated. In the absence of their users, these tools seem to utter a new language, more like poetry than the workaday practicality to which human presence submits them. The Gnomon, gnosis, and metaphysical time The Evil Genius of a Kings central red slab (which stands slightly inclined to the left, attached laterally to some kind of frame) prefigures a thin, tilted plane that reappears in the four subsequent canvases. In The General's Illness, The Sailors' Barracks, Metaphysical Composition with Toys, and Metaphysical Composition, this central plane is not clunky and corpulent, as in The Evil Genius, but rather sleek. The partition may be identified as a gnomon?a primitive form of sundial, introduced to the Egyptians by Chaldean and Babylonian astronomers and brought from Babylonia to Greece by the pre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander (fig. 12). The gnomon was not, despite its exotic origins, foreign to</page><page sequence="20">Merjian: Untimely objects 205 Figure 12. A modern gnomon.

The allegorical plates accompanying Girard Desargues's prominent treatise, Maniere Universelle de Monsieur Desargues pour pratiquer la perspective, for example, depict both perspective and "La Gnomonique" in kind (fig. 13 a, b). The gnomon particularly evinces the rapport between the practice of linear perspective and the phenomena of geometry and shadows?aspects prominent in de Chirico's entire oeuvre. Of course, these gnoma are not the first time telling devices to appear in de Chirico's cityscapes. They represent ancient, primitive counterparts to the clocks that appear in The Enigma of the Hour, Gare Montparnasse, and The Philosopher's Conquest.

But as I have been arguing, the Evil Genius paintings seek to confuse time more generally, rather than separate epochs or eons into discrete pictorial metaphors. In de Chirico's images, surface never betrays time, but rather purposely dissembles or effaces its trace. A Metaphysical space as painted by de Chirico never, I think, encloses pure time, "in itself/' Even if the gnoma in The Evil Genius of a King, The Sailors' Barracks, and Metaphysical Composition with Toys separate their contents into two distinct sides, for instance, none of these objects transparently denotes a specific age or history. Interestingly, the gnoma in the remaining four canvases of the Evil Genius series?The General's Illness, The Sailors' Barracks, Metaphysical Composition with Toys, and Metaphysical Composition?cannot carry out their purported function as sundials, for the platform on which they have been erected is pitch black. We cannot make out where these gnoma cast their shadows. But the word gnomon itself contains a multiplicity of meaning and uses, and the object's presence here may perform a role less practical than semantic and literary. The etymology of gnomon attests to its status as both a scientific and mathematical instrument and a metaphor for knowledge, wisdom, and revelation. The Latin and Greek root for gnomon denotes (at least) three meanings at once: "the index of a sundial," "a carpenter's square," and "one that knows."72 The Indo European root gno- signifies "knowledge" in its various manifestations and applications. The Greek yvcb|jvco literally means "one who discerns"; in some contexts, the word means, more broadly, "indicator," or something that points. For example, gnomon can refer either to the rod, which casts a shadow and thus measures time, or to a cipher or geometric figure (such as a parallelogram) used by mathematicians.73 Accordingly, Heraclitus's fragments are widely described as "gnomic/' The extent to which de Chirico paid attention to the semantics of "gnomonics" is uncertain. But he seems to have been well attuned to the multilayered meanings of the object itself, as well as its philological versatility. Like the etymological condensation of various meanings into this one word, de Chirico's painted gnoma strive to conflate scientific knowledge with celestial intuition, to confound geometric and temporal exactitude with a sense of intuitive, aphoristic insight. In short, the Evil Genius series invokes instruments of science and mathematics as touchstones for more rarefied notions. The tools of Western astronomy become vectors of vaguely "astrological" allusions. Conclusion: Silence; signs, and untimely echoes The Evil Genius paintings condense and layer various references in singular objects, bounded by crisp outlines. Different spatial and temporal registers continually loop back upon themselves, overlapping, diverging, and rejoining even in the most local (and immobile) of physical details?a toy that might be a sophisticated engineering instrument, a piece of candy that might actually be a fossilized relic. We cannot read The Evil Genius of a King's objects unequivocally as artefactual or newfangled, for they confuse these dimensions beyond discernment?even if that confusion is not flaunted as a formal, plastic element on the objects' surfaces. To wit, in Carl Einstein's book, Die Kunst des 20 Jarhunderts, published in 1931, The Evil Genius of a King appears with the title Ruinen (Ruins). In Soby's original monograph on the artist, however, it was listed?also mistakenly?as Toys of a Prince. The painting has thus kept playing out the ambivalences between fossil and futuristic commodity, between talisman and toy. To tease apart the layers of autobiographical, philosophical, topographical, and semiotic references in these images?to treat them separately?is to disavow their stubborn reconciliation of opposites. For each valence doubles back onto its obverse: commodity fetishism and the fetishism of the "prehistoric Hellenes"; the child's plaything and the engineer's tool; droll punning and dead-serious morbidity; a history of art and a navel-gazing narrative of the self; duration and immediacy. Into one framed point of view they distill various subject positions: that of prehistoric man and the ubermenschian philosopher; the older, mad Nietzsche and the young de Chirico; the ancient augur and the modern Metaphysician. 71. Raolo Baldacci suggests, for example, that the division of space in the Evil Genius paintings forms a "geometric metaphor of the two principle 'zones' of time, the past and the future, lying on either side of the 'eternal present'" Baldacci (see note 4), p. 240. 72.

Dada 2, December 1917, Zurich, frontispiece; Tristan Tzara's "Poemes Negres" facing de Chirico's The Evil Genius of a King. This last conflation is perhaps the most dramatic. More than any of de Chirico's previous still lifes, the Evil Genius paintings liken the picture plane to an oracular space in its own right: a sheltered slab or shrine upon which is strewn a constellation of objects whose meaning seems to lie in the way the objects are staged and framed, as much as what those objects are. If de Chirico's early The Enigma of the Oracle (fig. 4) captures the moment of "waiting for the mysterious revealing oracle"?a moment embedded into a larger pictorial narrative?The Evil Genius of a King f igures the very canvas as a kind of sacred configuration. Whereas the former painting's sense of mystery hinges upon a veiling curtain and an attendant officiant, The Evil Genius of a King places the viewer himself before an exposed altar. You are invited to read these objects as if you were the priest of Apollo, the Etruscan hepatomancer, the chlamys-draped soothsayer. You are invoked as the live subject of the scene, in real time. Offered up in plain day, in the most public of places, the Metaphysical still life seems here to propose that the everyday objects of the world are the stuff of collective poetry?like architecture, a domain of workaday lyricism. This is the general condition that de Chirico intends when he aspires "to live in the world as if in an immense museum of strangeness."74 Not every viewer will grasp or heed such an invocation, however. Only he who recognizes the philosophical shibboleth that these images whisper?like de Chirico in his friend's Gartz's ear?to the elect. Despite the transparency of these images' displays, they do not propose any collective use. If the objects in de Chirico's still lifes appear to have broken through museum walls into the public square, they are nonetheless painted and framed with deliberation. I think de Chirico chose to paint increasingly esoteric imagery in the public space of the piazza as a foil to what he calls in his Parisian notebooks "the triviality of crowds."75 The peculiarity of De Chirico's painting obtains, in great part, from the tension created between their exceedingly?indeed, uniquely?public presentation and their increasingly esoteric appearance, between their solicitous exposure and stubborn silence. George Steiner writes: "This election of silence by the most 74. G. de Chirico, "Eluard MSS," X, in Ashbery (see note 2), p. 186. 75. Ibid., p. 202.</page><page sequence="23">208 RES 57/58 SPRING/AUTUMN 2010 articulate is, I believe, historically recent. [But] the strategic myth of the philosopher who chooses silence because of the ineffable purity of his vision or because of the unreadiness of his audience has antique precedent. It contributes to the motif of Empodocles on Aetna and to the gnomic aloofness of Heraclitus."76 Like Heraclitus's aphorisms (some of them only a few words long), The Evil Genius of a King points with gnomic economy. But what it indicates is uncertain. Like Nietzsche and Heraclitus, de Chirico leaves behind terse gems of lyrical wisdom, to be passed over by those in a hurry, or else seized upon by like-minded initiates. Of course, Nietzsche's writings and Heraclitus's gnomic aphorisms are not the only sources of the Evil Genius configurations. But when de Chirico claims consciously to evoke at once the somber wisdom of both ancient Hellenic priests and earth's first primitives; when he strips plastic dimensions to their most basic configuration in order to condense and conceal (to the general public) a multitude of esoteric allusions, it is undoubtedly to Nietzsche and Heraclitus's precedents that he turns. For their aphoristic examples epitomized the tension that could be established between the plain presentation of language, and a recondite, abstruse significance, one that alienates the mass of individuals while attracting a select few. All of de Chirico's early Metaphysical paintings evince that paradox. But the Evil Genius canvases especially rehearse the tension between a visual offering and an intellectual absconding, between a physical availability?even solicitation?and a semantic, hermeneutic withholding. In an ironic twist of art historical fate, The Evil Genius of a King was reproduced for the first time in one of the most radically antielitist, anti-Art forums in the history of aesthetics: the second issue of the journal Dada, published in Zurich in 1917 (fig. 14). The canvas sits opposite Tristan Tzara's "Poemes Negres" and is the only figurative painting included (the other paintings by Jean Arp, Wassily Kandinsky, Robert Delaunay, etc., are all decidedly abstract works). Something about this painting, then, spoke to the Dadaists about the language of abstraction?or at least the potential abstraction of figurative language, whittled back down to a primal utterance. The Evil Genius of a King approaches? perhaps even caricatures?abstract painting, but never fully renounces figurative contours. I think this is a purposeful strategy on de Chirico's part. He must have relished the notion that the novelty of The Evil Genius of a Kingbe rooted in figurative forms, that it evince the privileged nobility of silence without nihilistically renouncing its purchase on physical sense. Rather than a flight out of the discursive, these images would perform an involution of ordinary representation, back to its obscured core?a return to what Nietzsche calls the "Sporadic-proverbial preliminary stage of philosophy": Homeric language . . . contains an indefinite number of archaic formulations on which the genuine ancestry of the language depends?formulations that would no longer be grammatically understood by later singers and for this reason would be imagined, by false analogies, to be new expressions.77 In its hushed dumbness, The Evil Genius of a King tempts us to fall into a similar misreading?to mistake an untimely echo, an antiquarian atavism, for something new. De Chirico would likely have scoffed at the "false analogies" drawn from his paintings by his contemporaries?the analogy, for example, that landed The Evil Genius of a King alongside a series of abstract works in a journal dedicated to eradicating art. For the painting's strangeness derives from archaisms and anachronisms that his contemporaries duly mistook for novelties. The image's superlative philosophical sophistication passes for naTve nonsense?even a kind of primal grunt. The entire Evil Genius series hinges on this rarefied combination of clarity and confusion, ingenuousness and concealment, the apodictic and the unsure. The paintings' timed silences ensure misrecognition by us citizens and, conversely, identification by initiates into their Nietzschean mysteries. Their true apprehension is meant, ultimately, only for a happy few. 76. G.
