<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Coinages Attributable to Issus JAMES C.BRINDLEY [plate 1] Bing1 has recently re-located the mint of the 'Lion Staters', dating from the mid-fourth century bc to the time of Alexander's conquest, at Issus rather than Myriandros, which had been Newell's earlier choice.2 He based this largely on the distinctive walking lion which characterizes the coin's reverse, comparing it with a representation of this animal in the rectangular countermarks on staters of the south-east Asia Minor cities at the time of the Satrap's Revolt ( c . 370-360 bc). These have Semitic inscriptions considered by him to represent the Aramaic and Phoenician spellings, respectively, of the ethnic of Issus, and they are generally held to have been impressed by local officials. The issues here discussed take this coinage back to the end of the fifth century3 and further support Bing's re-allocation of the Lion staters. From Tiribazus' time on, the series is named with the Greek ethnic of Issus and is dateable within close limits. The preceding issues, however, carry varied Semitic lettering whose interpretation is more problematic. Group 1 c. 405-400 bc Obv. Icthyomorphic deity facing with bearded head to left : the right hand holds a vertical trident, the left holds a wreath. The lower body is a curving fish tail with ridged and spined back ending in two flukes. Circular dot frame. Rev.

The reverse has distinctive details which recur on later issues now attributed to the Issus mint, e.g. the flailing lion's tail and the rocky ground beneath.5 Details are distinct only on the Paris specimen since the others have been heavily cleaned, which would account at least partly for their inferior weights, and it is unsafe to attempt die distinctions. The presence of the small denominations implies a full-scale issue. Flans are smallish and the circular die usually leaves an incuse depression, agreeing with a date around the end of the fifth century. Group 2 c. 400-395 bc Obv. Nude, bearded Heracles advancing to the right on line : he holds out a bow in the left hand and raises a club to head level in the right. A lion skin drapes his shoulders and back, descending almost to the ankles. Circular dot frame. Rev. Lion walking to the right (left on fractions) as before but sometimes without line below: head facing and curled tail hanging down.

With the benefit of a better specimen Jenkins read if as aleph-zayin in (probably) Phoenician script and, in spite of the Persian weight, was inclined to believe that this region might be its source. Reverse type and inscription put the coin in the present series, and its place there is consistent with a date slightly later than Group 1. Remarkably, the obverse shows Heracles' right hand holding the club behind (i.e. at the left hand side of) his head, an idiosyncracy which can also be seen on the coinage of Citium.8 The unusual lion with facing head is found on a later, small silver, issue9 of Issus, but the unique cross-pellet 5 Newell, op. cit., pp. 17ff. 6 E.

The latter are closely connected with it, however, for these are placed in precisely the same way on the stater obverses - an unusual location in Cilician coins which otherwise have the name of the issuing authority on the reverse. The unnamed obverse figure releasing a bird is evidently a novel standing form of Baal, and it displaces the Heracles figure to the other side of the coin. The sculpture, especially of the reverse, is of good quality. Two main obverse dies are recognizable. Die 1 shows a crisp, finely drawn inscription (Pl. 1, C) which clearly reads aleph- z ay in and is identical with that on Groups 1 and 2 coins. The Lanz catalogue shows it clearly and unequivocally. Die 2, though imperfect in many specimens due to wear and to corrosion, shows a different pair of letters. The inscription here is softly rendered and would appear to read kaf-zayin. In each case the lettering is, apparently, Phoenician. The coin representing sub-group c has probably a third obverse die, rather poorly preserved and with inscription, if any, off the flan.

BRINDLEY dies until their details had practically disappeared, and to this may be attributed the vague letters on the Paris stater and their apparent absence from some others. There may be as many as six reverse dies, though several are either poorly preserved or poorly illustrated: four are reasonably well defined. Group 4 Tiribazus - c. 386-380 bc The well-known satrapal issue of Tiribazus, struck in identical fashion for four mints. Of these Mallos is the commonest by far, followed by Issus, while Tarsus coins and especially those of Soli are much scarcer.

For the first time the mint name appears in Greek and this is written in full either as the genitive plural or as the neuter singular - a variation common in Cilician mints at this time.11 Tiribazus is named in Aramaic. Anthropomorphic representations of Ahuramazda are common on seals of the Achaemenian period and are likewise seen on coins of the Levantine region,12 but here the finely sculpted version breaks new ground in its purely Greek treatment achieved, it seems, with a degree of artistic license. In contrast to the conventional right-facing figure of the deity in oriental representations the bare torso here is frontally shown and this may account for changes in detail, so that while the left hand holds up a lotus blossom in the usual way on the opposite side the right elevates a wreath to his head. It seems plausible to suggest that in this modification, the wreath is a substitute for the (left hand) spiked ring of authority of the Samarían coins, and that an unusual polos-type head-dress now represents the oriental kidaris. The Greek AMI on this side of the coin is interpreted as a magistrate's name, shown at Issus for the first time. The issue was an important one here with 4-5 obverse, and at least 10 reverse, dies recognisable. Group 4 (continued) Small silver, perhaps of Issus (a) Obv.

While the details differ, there seems to be no problem in deriving the obverse type from that of the young, bare-headed Heracles, holding the horn of Acheloos on Euagoras I's obverses (e.g. BMC Cyprus 56). In the present case the god sits on a backless stool rather than a rock, holding up the empty horn in his left hand while his right lifts a phiale; also, his attributes are missing. The reverse figure, too, has its peculiarities. It is not, as might appear at first glance, simply a version of the obverse Baal of the Group 4 issues, although the flapping eagle is common to each case. Here the god is young and, since he faces to the right, the artist has found it necessary to transfer the bird to his left hand so as to preserve the general composition. Variations also occur. In one specimen (above, 0-35 g) the knob end and tapered body of a club are unmistakeable, while in another (0*73 g) no taper is present and the object may be a short sceptre. The drapery is short but it is not a lion skin. The figure may represent a Baal-Heracles syncretism, but is it not more likely in present circumstances that it results from a confusion by the artist of these two gods, for the young face and club are characteristics of the Issus Heracles just as the eagle and sceptre are of the Baal? Other comparable irregularities on the artist's part have already been noted in the Issus coinage. Attribution of some varieties of this coin to Issus is very tentative and rests, essentially, on the young Heracles type. The reverse inscription, too, is questionable. Corresponding to the reversal of the normal Baal type this is here on the left of the figure and reads downwards. In the BM and Levante specimens the third of the three tiny Aramaic letters is a simple downstroke, reading TRZ (for Tarsus), but another (above, 0-35 g) shows a joining bar at the left giving TRI (for Tiribazus). This would be in keeping with the type which it accompanies (e.g.</page><page sequence="7">ISSUS 7 Groups 3 and 4) and also with the pattern of Tiribazus' other Cilician issues which represent several mints.

BRINDLEY Group 5 staters have all the aspects of a regular city issue and follow closely the more or less contemporary issues of Side, Nagidus, and Holmi in the presence of full length figures of deities with their attributes on each side. The Apollo obverse is very close to the Apollo Sidetes of Side staters though it lacks some of the latter's accompaniments. The young Heracles of the reverse, however, is - as in Group 3 - very much in the Issus style, and here it also has a wreath (olive?) and ankh-type figure associated. The actual relation of the latter to the Egyptian symbol may be questioned, for it comprises a circle above two cross-bars without any vertical bar, and a bifid lower termination - a form which may be peculiar to the Issus mint. The Group 5 staters are poorer in style than before and their figures are considerably larger, often over-filling the broad flans. A single name appears on obverses of the first, (a), division but seems to be absent from (b) and (c).19 This issue may be dated with some degree of assurance to the decade 380-370 BC by the occurrence on it of those distinctive rectangular countermarks which are known to have been affixed to staters in this region at the time of the Satrap's Revolt20 but which are very rare on coins earlier than Pharnabazus' time (i.e. 379 bc).

In contrast to these, and for the first time on Issus staters, the deities are represented by their heads only and the bold modelling, compact flans and the use of loose dies set these coins apart as something of a special issue of the city. The occurrence of three varieties would seem to imply that the issue lasted for some time. Die defects - at the top of the middle helmet crest on Obverse die 1, and on Apollo's chin in Reverse die b - are of slight assistance in relative dating. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In their technical features, inscriptions and, to some extent, distinctive recurring types the six groups here described form a closely-knit series whose location at the Issus mint in the late-fifth to mid-fourth centuries bc is well supported. They develop such features as inscriptions gradually throughout the period. The earliest issues - Groups 1 and 2 - had already adopted the Walking Lion reverse which, later on, in Mazaeus' time became so characteristic of the mint. This series ends with the Satrap's Revolt of the 460s bc. Throughout the period in question these obverse dies have a flat field and circular frame of dots; reverse dies are circular, without frame, and initially produce somewhat incuse surfaces. There seems to have been a crude attempt to adjust the dies either in normal, reversed, or rectangular positions which, though approximate on the staters, may be clear enough on the small denominations. Group 6 marks a departure from this. At Issus, from Group 3 on, the inscription - ruler or ethnic - is placed on the obverse in contrast to usage at other Cilician mints; only the latest, and special, Group 6 departs from this. In Groups 3 to 5 the presence of full- figure deities on both faces recalls the corresponding coins of Side, Nagidus and Holmi, though at Issus a persistent frontal style is distinctive. Perhaps on this account Issus may be considered to have exerted a radical influence on Tiribazus' major, and cosmopolitan, issue (Group 4) which is usually connected with larger-scale troop recruitment for the future campaign against Egypt. The occurrence of a magistrates' name in Group 4 (c. 386 bc on) finds a parallel in the Nagidus series23 and elsewhere and, while small fractions similar to the staters occur in Groups 1 and 2 none - excepting those tentatively associated with Group 4 - has been recognized later.24 Ph. Lederer, 'Die Staterprägung der Stadt Nagidos', ZFN 41 (1931), pp. 153ff. 24 Since this paper was written a small fraction ('obol') of unknown weight has appeared in list no. 4 (July-August 1992) of Frank Sternberg, Zurich. It (no. 74) seems certainly to belong to Group 6. The description is: Young male head right similar to Heracles' head reverse of Group No. 6. No border but traces of slight circular incuse are indicated. Athena head almost facing (as in Group 6 obverse). Dot circle. The coin - uninscribed - is allocated to Cyprus or Cilicia (?) in the Sternberg List.</page><page sequence="10">10 J. C. BRINDLEY One aspect of the present series merits further consideration. In Bing's study of the letter variations and spelling connected with Issus he sees the two countermark inscriptions impressed in the 360s as the Aramaic and Phoenician spellings, respectively, of the ethnic of 'Issus'. He is inclined to treat the inscription (PL 1, A) on the Fish God/Lion stater as an aberrant form of the same ethnic,25 drawing attention to comparable anomalies in the ethnic on Pharnabazus' staters associated with Tarsus {BMC 21-2). Earlier writers,26 too, had trouble in attempting to read a mint name into this inscription. It is now seen that this lettering is repeated in Groups 2 and 3 (Pl. 1, B &amp; C) and in the last case is sometimes substituted by a second (Pl. 1, D). Neither of the latter give any hint of garbled lettering but are well defined in each case: they seem to be authentic. Perhaps these represent the names of rulers rather than mints - Aleph-zayin . . . ranging through Groups 1, 2 and into 3 ( c . 405-390 bc), to be then succeeded by Kaf-zayin . . . until Tiribazus entered the scene c.386 bc? Such abbreviations would be well suited as personal names, and the lack of historical information on eastern Cilicia from the disappearance of the Syennesis dynasty after Cunaxa to the appearance of named satraps for Abernahra would leave ample time for the appearance of such ephemeral rulers.27 25 Bing, op. cit., p. 1 1 n. 3£.
