Conferences jointly organized by RCMI and RIdIM were a regular annual practice from 1973 and 1980, and it was at the Graduate Center where RIdIM got its early direction during the 1970s, under the guidance of its cofounder and first president Barry S. Brook (1918-1997). As RIdIM grew stronger and more countries became involved with cataloguing, its subsequent conferences moved out of New York and took place in Mainz (1982), Paris (1985), and Hamburg (1991). The idea of reviving the tradition of RIdIM' s conferences was driven by the vision, which I share with Antonio Baldassarre, the current president of RIdIM, of tying together the research and cataloging of sources for music iconography. Only by correctly understanding the context of a picture it is possible to produce a meaningful description of it, and then its cataloguing and indexing. It was therefore truly exciting that the conference's topic, Music , Body , and Stage : The Iconography of Music Theater and Opera - which surprisingly has not been systematically explored before - attracted a large number of senior and junior scholars, who had the opportunity to reflect on both the new directions in music iconography of theater performances and the place of the research and cataloguing of iconographie sources in twenty- first-century academia. Sixty-eight participants attended the conference held at the Graduate Center (11-14 March 2008), and twenty-two of their presentations - mainly concerned with the interpretation of historical sources from before the twentieth century - were selected for publication in this volume. In the organization of this conference I had extraordinary help from RIdIM' s president Antonio Baldassarre and I should express to him my sincere appreciation. It was a real pleasure to conceptualize with him the program of the conference and to work on its organization. The initiative to revive the series of RIdIM' s conferences, which RCMI reignited by organizing this New York meeting, has been graciously taken up by the RIdIM Group of Brazil, which is planning the organization of the next meeting at the Universidade Federal da Bahia in Salvador in 2011.
