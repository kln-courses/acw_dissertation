<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Do Elephants Have Souls? Caitrin Nicol There is mystery behind that masked gray visage, an ancient life force,  delicate and mighty, awesome and enchanted, commanding the silence  ordinarily reserved for mountain peaks, great fires, and the sea.  – Peter Matthiessen, The Tree Where Man Was Born The birth of an elephant is a spectacular occasion. Grandmothers, aunts,  sisters, and cousins crowd around the new arrival and its dazed mother,  trumpeting and stamping and waving their trunks to welcome the floppy  baby who has so recently arrived from out of the void, bursting through  the border of  existence  to  take  its place  in  an unbroken  line  stretching  back to the dawn of life. After almost two years  in the womb and a  few minutes to stretch  its  legs, the calf can begin to stumble around. But its trunk, an evolutionarily  unique inheritance of up to 150,000 muscles with the dexterity to pick up  a pin and the strength to uproot a tree, will be a mystery to it at first, with  little  apparent  use  except  to  sometimes  suck  upon  like  human babies  do  their thumbs. Over time, with practice and guidance, it will find the poten- tial in this appendage flailing off its face to breathe, drink, caress, thwack,  probe, lift, haul, wrap, spray, sense, blast, stroke, smell, nudge, collect, bathe,  toot, wave, and perform countless other functions that a person would rely  on a combination of eyes, nose, hands, and strong machinery to do. Once the calf is weaned from its mother’s milk at five or whenever its  next sibling is born, it will spend up to 16 hours a day eating 5 percent of  its entire weight in leaves, grass, brush, bark, and basically any other kind  of  vegetation.  It will  only  process  about  40  percent  of  the nutrients  in  this food, however; the waste it leaves behind helps fertilize plant growth  and provide accessible nutrition on the ground to smaller animals,  thus  Caitrin Nicol is managing editor of The New Atlantis. 10 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

From 250 pounds  at birth, it will continue to grow throughout its life, to up to 7 tons for a  male of the largest species or 4 tons for a female. Of the many types of elephants and mammoths that used to roam the  earth, one born today will belong to one of three surviving species: Elephas  maximus in Asia, Loxodonta africana (savanna elephant) or Loxodonta cyclotis  (forest elephant) in Africa. There are about 500,000 African elephants alive  now (about a third of them the more reticent, less studied L. cyclotis), and  only  40,000 – 50,000  Asian  elephants  remaining.  The  Swedish  Elephant  Encyclopedia  database  currently  lists  just  under  5,000  (most  of  them  E. maximus)  living  in  captivity  worldwide,  in  half  as  many  locations —  meaning that the average number of elephants per holding is less than two;  many of them live without a single companion of their kind. For the freeborn, if it is a cow, the “allomothers” who welcomed her  into the world will be with her for life — a matriarchal clan led by the old- est and biggest. She in turn will be an enthusiastic caretaker and playmate  to her younger cousins and siblings. When she is twelve or fourteen, she  will go into heat (“estrus”) for the first time, a bewildering occurrence dur- ing which her mother will stand by and show her what to do and which  male to accept.

She may have another every four to five years into her fifties  or sixties, but not all will survive. If it is a bull, he will stay with his family until the age of ten or twelve,  when his increasingly rough and suggestive play will cause him to be sent  off. He may loosely join forces with a few other young males, or trail around  after older ones he looks up to, but for the most part he will be independent  from then on. Within the next few years he will start going into “musth,”  a periodic  state of  excitation  characterized by  surging  levels of  testoster- one, dribbling urine and copious secretions from his temporal glands, and  extreme aggression responsive only to the presence of a bigger bull, who has  an immediate dominance that the young male risks injury or death by failing  to defer to. Although he reaches sexual maturity at a fairly young age, thanks  to the competition he may not sire any children until he is close to thirty.  (Ancient Indian poetry lauds bulls in musth for their amorous powers, even  as keepers of Asian elephants have respected the phase as one highly danger- ous to humans since time immemorial. Until 1976, it was widely believed in  the scientific community that African elephants do not enter musth. This  changed when researchers at Amboseli National Park  in Kenya were dis- mayed to note an epidemic of “Green Penis Syndrome,” which they feared  signaled some horrible venereal disease — until they realized it was nothing  more nor less alarming than the very definition of a force of nature.) Other than this primal temporary madness, elephants (when they do not feel threatened) are quite peaceable, with a gentle, loyal, highly  social nature. Here is how John Donne, having seen one at a London expo- sition in 1612, put it: Natures great master-peece, an Elephant, The onely harmlesse great thing; the giant Of beasts; who thought, no more had gone, to make one wise But to be just, and thankfull, loth to offend, (Yet nature hath given him no knees to bend) Himselfe he up-props, on himselfe relies, And foe to none, suspects no enemies. Donne is not the first or the last to view the elephant in its stature and  dignity as a synecdoche  for the total grandeur of the universe, come to  earth in lumpen grey form. Here he suggests that it represents a moral  ideal as well. Animals are often celebrated for virtues that they seem to  12 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="4"> Do Elephants Have Souls? embody: dogs for loyalty, bears for courage, dolphins for altruism, and so  on. But what does it really mean for them to model these things? When  people  act  virtuously,  we  give  them  credit  for  well-chosen  behavior.  Animals, it is presumed, do so without choosing. From  a  religious,  anthropocentric  perspective,  it  might  be  said  that  while animal virtues do not entail morality for the animals themselves, they  reveal to us the goodness in creation; as the medieval theologian Johannes  Scotus Eriugena wrote, “In a wonderful and inexpressible way God is cre- ated in His creatures.” From a more biological view, it might be noted that  people mostly do not choose their dispositions either, that behavioral ten- dencies are more determined than we like to tell ourselves, and that blame  and credit for such things are often misapplied in human contexts too. But the latter idea — that humans, although capable of conscious self- direction,  are  as mutely  carried  along  by  the  force  of  selection  as  your  friendly  neighborhood  amoeba — simply  elides  the  question,  while  the  former raises many more; the tiger is as much God’s creature as the lamb.  In any case, the capacity for “choosing” is a binary conceit that gestures  at something much fuller, an inner realm of awareness, selfhood, and pos- sibility. In other words, a soul. To  the  ancients,  soul  was  anima,  that  which  animates,  the  living-,   moving-, breathing-ness of a biological being. In this sense, not only ani- mals but plants have souls (of different capacities appropriate to what they  are). For many religions, by contrast, the soul is specifically incorporeal,  perhaps  immortal,  and believed  to be unique  to human beings, who are  responsible (to a point) for its condition. To modern science it is, if any- thing, the hard problem of consciousness, also commonly thought to be  the province of just one species. Without either choosing sides or somehow reconciling these three duel- ing realities with each other, it would be impossible to say what a soul is, let  alone who has one. But there is a fourth sense in which when we talk about  it, we all mean more or  less  the  same  thing: what  it means  for  someone  to bare it, for music to have it, for eyes to be the window to it, for it to be  uplifted or depraved. Even if, religiously, we know by revelation that other  people possess them for eternity, we only engage with or know anything  about them at a quotidian level by way of the same cues and interactions  that a more this-worldly view would take as their sum total: bright eyes, a  dejected slump, a sudden manic inspiration or a confession of regret. Also a matter of conventional wisdom is the idea that human beings are  on one side of a great divide while all animals are on the other, subjects of  their instincts and our necessities and pleasures. What exactly the divide  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 13 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Various contestants have included reason,  language, art, technology, religion, walking upright and the use of hands,  knowledge  of  mortality,  sin,  suicide,  and  more.  In The Explicit Animal  (1991), Raymond Tallis rounds up a master list of them: Man has called himself  (among other  things):  the rational animal;  the  moral animal; the consciously choosing animal; the deliberately evil ani- mal; the political animal; the toolmaking animal; the historical animal;  the  commodity-making  animal;  the  economical  animal;  the  foreseeing  animal; the promising animal; the death-knowing animal; the art-making  or  aesthetic  animal;  the  explaining  animal;  the  cause-bearing  animal;  the classifying animal; the measuring animal; the counting animal; the  metaphor-making animal; the talking animal; the laughing animal; the  religious animal; the spiritual animal; the metaphysical animal; the won- dering animal . . .  Man, it seems, is the self-predicating animal. As Tallis goes on to explain, any given one of those distinctions is both  too  narrow,  in  being  an  insufficient  explanation  of  what makes  human  beings human, and too open, in being demonstrably shared to some extent  by another species. Chimpanzees and other large primates,  for  instance, are so intelligent  and personable that they blur many of these boundaries. But since we are  so closely connected evolutionarily,  it  is easy to tacitly view them as way  stations toward the human apex, impoverished versions of ourselves rather  than somebody in their own right. There is, however, nothing else remotely  like  an  elephant.  (Its  closest  living  relatives  are  sea  cows — dugongs  and  manatees — and the hyrax, an African shrewmouse about the size of a rab- bit.) As such, it presents the perfect opportunity for thoughtful reconsidera- tion of the human difference, and how much that difference really matters. An Elephant Never Forgets To the elephant, our scrap of consciousness May seem as inconsequential as a space-invader blip.  – Heathcote Williams, Sacred Elephant In 1974, Thomas Nagel famously took a stab at one of the great riddles of  the universe: What is it like to be a bat? To some scientists and philosophers,  he noted, this is an unanswerable question; it is not like anything to be a bat  because (they believe) the bat does not have enough awareness to subjec- tively experience itself. Nagel, taking for granted that bats have some kind  of experience, also determined  that  the question  is unanswerable because  14 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

For  people hoping nonetheless  to  comprehend  the  lives  of  elephants,  there is an astounding wealth of information about them, a tiny fraction of  which appears in the sidebar on page 36, a slightly larger fraction on my  office shelves, and a realistically inexhaustible fund in libraries, databases,  and  oral  histories  around  the  world.  The  best  of  these  come  out  of  an  ethological renaissance kicked off with Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton’s  Among the Elephants (1975) and continued in such works as Cynthia Moss’s  Elephant Memories (1988), Joyce Poole’s Coming of Age with Elephants (1996),  Katy Payne’s Silent Thunder  (1998),  and more, with  longitudinal  findings  compiled  in  the  magisterial  volume The Amboseli Elephants  (2011).  The  result of a close-knit, crack team of researchers who have been patiently and  creatively observing the same elephant families for decades, this work com- bines the power of concrete study with the power of story and narrative. Powerful for us, that is, onlookers from the outside. What is it like to  be an elephant? Is it like anything? How would we know? One of  the major clues that elephants have something we would rec- ognize as  inner  lives  is  their extraordinary memories. This  is attested  to  by  outward  indicators  ranging  from  the  practical — a  matriarch’s  recol- lection of a locale, critical to leading her family to food and water — to the   passionate — grudges that are held against specific people or types of people  for decades or even generations, or fierce affection for a long-lost friend. Carol Buckley,  co-founder  of  the Elephant  Sanctuary  in Tennessee,  a  retirement ranch for maltreated veterans of circuses and zoos, describes the  arrival of a newcomer to the facility. The fifty-one-year-old Shirley was first  introduced to an especially warm resident of long standing named Tarra:  “Everyone watched in joy and amazement as Tarra and Shirley intertwined  trunks  and made  ‘purring’  noises  at  each  other.  Shirley  very  deliberately  showed Tarra each injury she had sustained at the circus, and Tarra then  gently moved her  trunk over each  injured part.” Later  in  the evening, an  elephant named Jenny entered the barn — one who, as it turned out, had as  a calf briefly been in the same circus as Shirley, twenty-two years before: There was an immediate urgency in Jenny’s behavior. She wanted to  get close to Shirley who was divided by two stalls. Once Shirley was  allowed into the adjacent stall the interaction between her and Jenny  became quite intense. Jenny wanted to get into the stall with Shirley  desperately. She became agitated, banging on  the gate  and  trying  to  climb through and over. Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 15 Copyright 2013.

The  interaction was  dramatic,  to  say  the  least,  with  both  elephants  trying to climb in with each other and frantically touching each other  through the bars. I have never experienced anything even close to this  depth of emotion. We  opened  the  gate  and  let  them  in  together. . . . they  are  as  one  bonded physically together. One moves, and the other shows in unison.  It is a miracle and joy to behold. All day. . . they moved side by side and  when Jenny lay down, Shirley straddled her in the most obvious pro- tective manner and shaded her body from the sun and harm. They were inseparable until Jenny died a few years later. More  stories  of  kind  mentoring  in  a  new  home  come  courtesy  of  another elephant rescue site, this one in Kenya, where orphans are raised  to be reintroduced as adults into the wild. This is a big adjustment, not  often attempted for animals who have lived for some length of time in a  captive or domesticated setting, but the new releases are helped by older  elephants who have gone through the same thing themselves (especially  important in welcoming them into a herd that is not their blood kin). In  a 2011 report in National Geographic, head keeper Joseph Sauni recounts  how an adventurous little one named Irima ran away to try out his inde- pendence early. After a few days, a trumpety clamor was heard at the gate.  16 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. iStockphoto </page> <page sequence="8"> Do Elephants Have Souls? “Irima must have told the group that he still needed his milk and orphan  family and wanted to go back,” says Sauni, so Edo, a graduate of the cen- ter, walked Irima home. “The keepers opened the gate, and Edo escorted  Irima all the way back to the stockades. Edo drank some water from the  well, ate some food, and took off again. Mission accomplished.” Such solicitude is not limited to their own kind. In Coming of Age with Elephants, Joyce Poole tells the story of a ranch herder whose leg was  broken  by  a  matriarch  in  an  accidental  confrontation  with  her  family.  When  his  camels wandered  back without  him  in  the  evening,  a  search  party was sent out. He was eventually discovered under a tree, attended  by a female elephant who fiercely prevented anybody from approaching.  As they were preparing to shoot her, the herder frantically signaled for  them to stop. When they were finally able to draw her far enough away  for them to go and get him, he explained that after the elephant had struck him, she “realized” that he could not walk  and, using her trunk and front feet, had gently moved him several meters  and propped him up under the shade of a tree. There she stood guard over  him through the afternoon, through the night, and into the next day. Her  family left her behind, but she stayed on, occasionally touching him with  her trunk. When a herd of buffaloes came to drink at the trough, she left  his side and chased them away. It was clear to the man that she “knew”  that he was injured and took it upon herself to protect him. From whence come these altruistic actions? Are they the product of  blind instinct in the animal, the residue of ancestral behavior benefiting  kin, whereas for humans they would be a generous and morally commend- able choice? Or is the truth somewhere in between, some combination of  the two, for both of us? Poole illustrates how the standard framework of  evolutionary theory is problematic in describing even highly survival- and  reproduction-oriented interactions: As a behavioral ecologist, I have been trained to view non-human ani- mals as behaving in ways that don’t necessarily involve any conscious  thinking  and  that  their  decisions  have  been  simply  genetically  pro- grammed through the course of natural or sexual selection. But in the  course of watching elephants, I have always had a sense that they often  do think about what they are doing, the choices they have, and the deci- sions that they are making. For example, when a young musth male is  threatened by a high-ranking musth male, his usual response is to drop  out of musth immediately. He lowers his head, and urine dribbling can  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 17 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Many biologists would explain this phe- nomenon simply by arguing that males who behave in manner X live  to produce more surviving offspring than males who behave in manner  Y, and thus the trait for behaving in manner X is passed on to future  generations. Thus, male elephants today automatically behave the way  they do because  they have been programmed  through  the  successful  behavior of their ancestors to do so. It is worth noting that selectively, the decision tree here can go both ways:  drop out of musth, avoid the fight, and live to try again another day; or don’t,  and make the best play you can to pass your genes on then and there. It is  easy to see how either behavior might be rewarded and reinforced by repro- ductive success over time, either explained just as handily. But the bigger  problem is the assumption that in a way, the choice is already determined  prior to the interaction, even prior to those two elephants’ births, because as  an encoded response there is no room for it to be a choice at all. This auto- matically excludes a key factor in the scenario, as Poole continues: Although I rely on such explanations myself, as I have gotten to know  elephants better I have been more and more convinced that they do think,  sometimes consciously, about the particular situations in which they find  themselves. In the case of the young musth male, I believe that he may  actually consider his options:  to keep dribbling,  stand with head high,  and be attacked, or to cease dribbling, stand with head low, and be toler- ated. In other words, the male may in fact have some conscious control. . . . With dominance rank between males changing on a daily basis, a male  needs to be able to adjust his behavior accordingly. From past experi- ence he knows the characteristics of his rival’s body size, fighting ability,  and how that rival normally ranks relative to him, but if his rival is in  musth he also needs to assess whether he is in full musth and what sort  of  condition he  is  in. All of  this  information must be assimilated on a  daily basis and gauged relative to his own condition. Can so complex an  assessment be carried out without thinking? And I wonder whether the  more parsimonious explanation wouldn’t be that they think. Of course, similar mechanistic explanations are now often applied to human  actions as well. As Poole acknowledges,  they are grounded  in something  real, but do not allow for the fullest understanding of what is going on. In  a way, it may actually be more instructive to look at the flaws in this line of  reasoning with an animal example, which helps to avoid some of the meta- physical  minefields  surrounding  the  issue.  Properly  nuanced  discussions  about animal  activity  can be  soundly materialistic without being  reductive.  18 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Animal  science  that  describes  their  real  abilities, where  they  can  receive  credit  for  intelligent or compassionate actions driven by more than mere  instinct, would by extension elevate man’s stature too — not flatten it with  animals’, but raise them both above the low bar of pure determinism. This moral question is at the heart of Tarquin Hall’s To the Elephant  Graveyard (2000), a real-life chronicle of the hunt for a rogue bull elephant  that reads almost like a detective novel where nothing is as it first appears.  The victim is a drunk man plucked from out of his house and impaled in  his own yard. The suspect is a large “tusker” who seems to have sought  him out in the village for that express purpose, with no provocation, and  has done this to thirty-seven previous victims. A marksman is contracted  by the Indian government to shoot the bull and put a stop to this behavior.  Hall, a journalist based in New Delhi, believes something fishy is up and  finagles his way into the search party so he can expose it. Sure that Dinesh Choudhury, the marksman, is a stone-cold mercenary  insensate to the dignity of elephants, probably framing some meek hapless  creature  for crimes  it  could not  really have committed, Hall pompously  lectures him about them — only to have his pretensions flattened by this  man who loves and understands the hathi (elephants) far better than Hall  knew was even possible, and who inducts him into a whole hathi universe  of deep feeling and sly intelligence and indeed, moral agency. At  one  point  they  catch  up  with  the  elephant  and Mr.  Choudhury  steals  off  to  confront  him  alone — not  to  shoot,  but  simply  to meet  his  eyes and give him warning. “I have thrown down the gauntlet. Now the  rogue will either mend his ways or I will deal with him,” he explains to an  astounded Hall. “If a human kills, he is given a fair trial before sentencing  is carried out. Therefore, I always give each elephant a chance to redeem  himself. I say to him, ‘If you stay, you will die. If you go, you will live.’”  For a man who wants  the elephant  to  take  the offer, who hates nothing  more than shooting them, it seems an odd profession to go into; but Mr.  Choudhury notes that someone would be hired to do it, and “at least with  me in charge, the elephant has a chance.” Having tracked the hathi deep into the northern forest, one night they  encounter a legless man who turns out to be his former owner. Many years  ago, the man purchased him on a whim, having a lifelong affection for the  creatures but not knowing anything about them. Further, being often away  from home on business, the owner heedlessly left him in the care of a vicious  scamp, returning one day to find him tied up to a tree, malnourished, and  scarred from frequent beatings. The keeper (who was nowhere to be found  until he was discovered  locked up  for  fighting  in a bar) was  immediately  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 19 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

But a few  weeks later, the old keeper showed up again, belligerently drunk, demand- ing money from the owner and taunting the elephant. At the sight of his  tormenter, the elephant broke out of his restraints and smashed the keeper  to the ground repeatedly, crushing the owner’s legs on the way out. “I  believe  the  elephant  did  this  to me  deliberately,”  the  owner  says.  “He wanted me to live in agony. He wanted me to remember him every  day for the rest of my life. And so I have done for the past ten years.” The  elephant, in those ten years, has ranged all around killing dozens of men  in like manner — drunks who resembled his old foe. The owner does not  want revenge, he says, because he blames himself for what has happened;  but if they can shoot the hathi, he goes on, they “would be ending a lot of  pain and misery. Most of all his.” As a kind of trial, the elephant’s chase poses a question familiar from  real trials held in courtrooms every day: how much are violent offenders  warped by atrocious pasts responsible for what they do? How relevant is  this to what becomes of them, when there is a fundamental obligation to  protect society? Like humans, most traumatized elephants do not become violent, but  just absorb their hurts  in confusion and sadness and respond to  them in  other  familiar ways.  In The Dynasty of Abu  (1962),  the  zoologist  Ivan T.  Sanderson recounts the story of an elephant named Sadie, who was practic- ing but failing to learn a circus routine. Finally she gave up and bolted out  of the training ring, causing her to be chastised (not cruelly, he stresses)  “for her supposed stupidity and for trying to run away.” At this, she dropped  to  the  ground  and  dumbfounded  her  trainers  by  bawling  like  a  human  being. “She  lay there on her side,  the tears streaming down her  face and  sobs racking her huge body.” In almost half a century of close association with the Abu [elephants],  including and even after reading a substantial part of the vast litera- ture concerning these majestic creatures, I have not encountered any- thing that has moved me so greatly, and I write this in all seriousness  and humility. Its ineffable pathos constantly brings to mind that most  famous verse “Jesus wept” (John 11:35). What on earth are we to make  of a so-called “lower animal” crying? If  you  shoot  an  animal,  you  may  expect  it  to  make  whimpering   noises. . . .That any animal, and especially one weighing 3 tons, should  lie  down  and  sob  her  heart  out  in  pure  emotional  frustration  is  something else again. It almost looks as if, despite all that we like to  believe, we humans  are not  the  only  creatures  that  possess what we  20 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="12"> Do Elephants Have Souls? call emotions and higher feelings. In fact,  if we insist upon making a  distinction between ourselves and other animals in this respect, we will  then have to provide a special niche for the Abu. In  Charles  Darwin’s  The Expression of the Emotions in Man and  Animals — an 1872 work  that,  together with The Descent of Man  (1871),  applies  the  principles  of  evolution  to  the  question  of  human  origins —  elephants appear twice: briefly in a note on the way their ears flare when  they charge each other for a fight, and more extensively with an inquiry  into  the  phenomenon  of  captive  elephants  weeping.  Darwin  reports  the  observations  of  a  colonial  secretary  in  Ceylon  (Sri  Lanka):  “When  overpowered and made fast, [one newly captured bull’s] grief was most  affecting; his violence sank to utter prostration, and he lay on the ground,  uttering  choking  cries,  with  tears  trickling  down  his  cheeks.”  Others,  meanwhile,  simply  “lay motionless  on  the  ground,  with  no  other  indi- cation  of  suffering  than  the  tears which  suffused  their  eyes  and  flowed  incessantly.”  A  zookeeper  in  London,  Darwin  adds,  witnessed  similar  occurrences whenever his companion pair of cows were split up. Ever the  painstaking naturalist, Darwin latches onto a physiological investigation  of the muscles surrounding the eyes — how their contraction may cause or  allow for tears, whether they are more likely to be contracted while pros- trate, and so forth. He manages to induce a batch of children to squeeze  these muscles repeatedly as a test, to very little tearful effect. What’s So Wrong with Anthropomorphism? We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept  of animals. Remote from universal nature, and living by complicated  artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his  knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in  distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic  fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and  greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world  older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gift- ed with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by  voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings;  they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time.  – Henry Beston, The Outermost House Though thanks to Darwin (if not Aristotle) it should come as no surprise  that  animals  seem to experience  in  some way many of  the  same  things  we do, physically and emotionally, in science the supposed imposition of  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 21 Copyright 2013.

In Love, Life, and Elephants (2012), Daphne Sheldrick — founder of the  orphanage mentioned above, and inventor of the first successful milk sub- stitute for infant elephants — describes her involvement in writing articles  about  animal  behavior  for  the  Wildlife  Clubs  of  Kenya’s  schools,  and  how to her dismay so much of the literature she read for this assignment  turned out to be abstruse and off the mark as compared with her and her  colleagues’ field experience: I  attributed  this  to  the  fact  that  science  precluded  researchers  from  interpreting animal behavior in an “anthropomorphic” way, and as such  they came up with complicated explanations as to why an animal was  behaving in a certain way, when, in fact, the answer was pretty simple.  One simply had to compare it to the likely response of the human ani- mal if subjected to the same set of circumstances. Researchers  are  not  even  supposed  to  name  their  subjects,  lest  the  sense of intimacy in a name compromise their objectivity. The primatolo- gist Jane Goodall was among the first to revolt from this convention, and  now most elephant ethologists go ahead and name their subjects too; as  Iain Douglas-Hamilton has said, “even if you identified an elephant by the  number M51, when you saw him coming your way, you would still say to  yourself, ‘My God, it’s M51!!! ’” Indeed, Douglas-Hamilton’s  remark  speaks  to  the  very  reason why  scientists worry about mixing human  feelings  into animal  research:  it’s  practically irresistible. Scientific observation is supposed to be detached,  but  science  after  all  is  conducted  by  human  beings,  and  human  hearts  naturally reach out to other sentient creatures; perhaps our affection for  them makes us want to see what isn’t there. Despite  its  limits, surely this  is a better orientation than that of the  British Raj officers of yore, who  in  the great  tradition of Royal Society  vivisections and other such doings obtained a wealth of information about  elephantine physiology by restraining the animals and applying pain to  find the most sensitive pressure points, coldly taking notes on their new  knowledge of the nervous system. But the dilemma remains: how to get  an accurate understanding of the animals’ nature and (if appropriate) emo- tions, without imposing on them assumptions born of a distinctly human  understanding of the world? 22 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

First of all, we as human beings are prone to mistake the thoughts and  feelings of each other, even the people we are closest to — how much more  so is this a risk in speculating about members of another species? Even  supposing  that  the  elephants  were  our  equals  in  intelligence,  their  life  differs  from  ours  so  fundamentally  that  trying  to  infer  their  perspective from our own experience is bound to miss the mark in many  ways. For one thing, as a rule elephants have poor vision — but their sense  of  smell  is  exquisite,  revealing a whole olfactory  landscape  that we are  contentedly closed off to. Also, they do not fall romantically in love (that  we know of; that their behavior indicates). Think how many other aspects  of our  lives are profoundly  influenced by good sight and deep eros, and  ask yourself what might  loom equally  large  in an elephant’s world that  we ourselves would have very little grasp of. And of course there are a  variety of other differences — where they live, how they live, the fact that  from birth to death a female (unless something has gone wrong) will never  be alone and after a certain point a male mostly will. How might these  things shape a psyche? Meanwhile, on our end, we the human race are masters of projection,  from the teddy bears (or in my case, stuffed raccoons and walruses) that  we  befriend  as  children  to  the  humanoid  robots  that  we may  build  or  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 23 Copyright 2013.

We like to feel that these inanimate objects have reciprocal affec- tions for us, although we always know at some level that they do not. For  real  sentient  beings,  though,  the  truth  is  more  complex.  They  are not us, but to look into their eyes is to know that someone is in there.  Imposing our own specific thoughts and feelings on that someone is in one  sense too imaginative, in presuming he could receive the world in the way  we do, and in another not imaginative enough, in not opening our minds to  the full possibilities of his difference. The philosopher and theologian Martin  Buber called this “the immense otherness of the Other,” reflecting on his  relationship with a family horse as a child. As he stroked the mane, “it was  as though the element of vitality itself bordered on my skin” — “something  that was not I,” he notes, but was “elementally” in relation to him. There  was an existential connection between them in their improbable blessing  of breathing, beating life. And not only life, but the particularity of sentient  individuals, as the horse “very gently raised his massive head, ears flicking,  then snorted quietly, as a conspirator gives a signal meant to be recogniz- able only by his fellow conspirator: and I was approved.” Of course, there is no way to know what the horse was really thinking  here. But as to what Buber was thinking — notice how he moves from their  shared primal vitality, realized by touch, to their distinct seats of awareness,  and the possibility of coming together in faux conspiracy. Consider how  any  empathetic  connection  forms.  You  begin  with  some  point  of  com- monality with your own life, something as elaborate as a similar identity  or experience or as simple as a feeling everybody knows firsthand, such  as pain or affection. From what is same, however basic, you can begin to  bridge the difference to what is other, and learn something new through  someone else’s eyes. This leap will always involve some element of imagination, as we can- not know exactly what someone may be  feeling on the other side. Thus  our empathy and irrepressible imagination are not merely impediments to  clear understanding, but may instead offer new avenues toward it. The second reason  for  the  taboo  is  that  in modern Western science, the whole concept of life is so mechanical that, if you look closely, not  even people are  supposed  to be anthropomorphized. Emotional, holistic  terms such as  love, sorrow, and concern have no place in an impoverished  language of chemical transactions at the micro level and selection pres- sures at the macro. Not that chemical transactions and selection pressures  are  not  essential  influences,  because  of  course  they  are — but  from  our  24 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

This  framework goes back to Descartes, whose dualistic universe of  absolute mind at one end and absolute matter at the other admitted noth- ing  in  between.  Indeed,  Descartes  reasoned  that  since  animals  are  not  rational,  they  are not  conscious,  and  since  they  are not  conscious,  they  cannot  even  be  aware  of  pain;  their  piteous  howls  during  the  horrible  experiments he conducted on  them were  to him mere reflex,  the unfelt  expression of material reactions akin to the shrieking of a teakettle. This  idea was  long  ago debunked,  but  the  philosophy  it  came  from  lives  on  in  various  ways.  Early  developers  of  artificial  intelligence,  for  instance,  focused  on  programming  mightily  rational  functions  such  as  chess and advanced mathematics — tasks that are ideally suited to comput- ers, but also, as M.I.T.’s Rodney Brooks quips in Flesh and Machines (2002),  that “highly educated male scientists found challenging,” which therefore  must  be  the  pinnacle  of  cogitation.  In  fact,  Brooks  realized, while  “the  things that children of four or five years could do effortlessly, such as visu- ally distinguishing between a coffee cup and a chair, or walking around on  two legs, or finding their way from the bedroom to the living room were  not thought of as activities requiring intelligence,” they represented the  real challenge for programming. Never mind small children — there is not  a robot in the world that knows the things a puppy knows. In  a  1990  paper  serendipitously  titled  “Elephants  Don’t  Play  Chess,”  Brooks  observes  that  evolutionarily,  “the  essence  of  being  and  reacting” — that is, “the ability to move around in a dynamic environment,  sensing the surroundings to a degree sufficient to achieve the necessary  maintenance of life and reproduction” — was a far more difficult develop- ment  than reason-centered capabilities,  as  impressive as  they are. More  importantly,  the  latter  emerged  in  continuity with  the  former,  not  as  a  detached occurrence with an unrelated meaning. This  is  an  important  corrective  to  the  abstraction  of  thought  from  embodiment, and ought to indicate that mental and emotional experiences  we know we have might well be shared to some degree by fellow creatures,  our evolutionary kin; discerning them is not  imposing human attributes  on animals but just acknowledging the results of a common heritage. To be sure, this field comes with its own pitfalls, the retroactive just-so  stories that speculatively explain the evolutionary heritage of any behavior,  as Poole discussed above. But in any event, today we have readmitted into  respectable science a whole spectrum of biologically-based feeling, though  this is actually because we are leaving behind the mind for just the matter.

That is a subject for another time, but for here and now  the lesson of Descartes is this: to deny obvious suffering based on a precon- ceived idea is as unscientific as it is heartless. Believing that the appearance  of boredom, loneliness, frustration, and grief in animals is simply an anthro- pomorphic projection is to labor under a forced ignorance that is protested  by our own intuition as well as all the evidence. Even as new developments  offer more insight into the distinctions between their feelings and ours, we  have to grant the benefit of the doubt that they are feeling something. At hird objection comes not out of science but from culture and politics: the  idea  that  acknowledging  even  faintly  human-seeming qualities  in  animals will ultimately serve not to affirm the moral worth of animals but to  debase the worth of human beings. The example of Peter Singer shows that  this fear is not unfounded. Singer’s classic 1975 manifesto Animal Liberation  is a passionate call for the protection of feeling animals, and in many ways the  founding document of the animal advocacy movement. (He eschews “rights”  talk, although this has mostly been lost on his followers and critics alike.) But Singer  is equally well known for promoting reprehensible  ideas  about the treatment of vulnerable human beings — the young, the old, the  ill, and the disabled. The insidious connection between these two stances  is a philosophy that attaches value to specific capacities rather than beings  as a whole: If a certain level of intelligence or other properties means ani- mals should be accorded more value, conversely, to Singer the absence of  those properties in some people makes those individuals worth less. In contrast to this kind of utilitarian, à la carte moral value, there is  a kind of animal advocacy that promotes a radical leveling of species: as  People  for  the  Ethical  Treatment  of  Animals  founder  Ingrid  Newkirk  famously  said,  “When  it  comes  to  pain,  love,  joy,  loneliness,  and  fear,  a  rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.” While Newkirk grounds her claim in core  emotions  (which  all  those  species  do  have),  others  take  the  position  to  what they see as its logical conclusion, equating any kind of life with any  other — a spider, a bacterium, a child — a concept whose practical implica- tions must either be nonexistent or paralyzingly exhaustive. Though  based  on  nearly  opposite  standards  for  how  to  value  living  beings, both these approaches basically annihilate human equality as a spe- cial ideal, that self-evident truth that somehow in all times and places has  been shockingly hard to defend. Hence valiant crusaders against assaults  on this  front,  such as bioethicist Wesley J. Smith  (author of a 2010 book  titled after Newkirk’s statement), smell danger in any discussion of animal  26 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Think of the beautiful stark simplicity of the “I Am a  Man” banners carried in the civil rights marches; what if, instead, they said  “I Am an Organism,” whose rights are either contingent or unenforceable?  This is the moral universe that people suspicious of animal advocacy fear. Animal welfare,  rather  than animal rights,  is  the proper  locus of our  concern,  they  seek  to  remind  us  (Smith  commonly makes  this  distinc- tion throughout the book and in his blogging and articles about “human  exceptionalism”);  it  is not the animals’ stature as  living beings but ours  as moral agents that obligates us to relate to them kindly. Whatever the  philosophical merits of this stance, it is certainly true at a practical level  that people have power over animals in most situations and so it is up to  us to set the standard for their treatment. So  what  does  animal  welfare  entail?  One  approach  is  outlined  in  Dominion  (2002),  Matthew  Scully’s  rigorous  critique  of  various  indus- trial and sporting practices based on known evidence of animal sentience  and emotion — a straightforward  if gruesome argument not that we are  offending our equals but that we are failing our dependents. On the other hand, it is hard to say what Smith considers an acceptable  limit on human needs and desires when balanced against animals’. He char- acterizes  Scully’s  book  as  “outrageously  anthropomorphic,”  and  describes  some of the writings of Jane Goodall, the world’s leading animal scientist,  as “pure figments of [her] imagination”; Goodall “almost screeches as she  anthropomorphizes  away.”  In  Smith’s  view,  Scully  and Goodall  go wrong  by inferring emotional states from animals’ observable behavior. Smith also  criticizes an elementary-school primer on farm animals as “propaganda,” not  only for the admittedly ridiculous inclusion of the names of vegan celebri- ties, but also for “anthropomorphically aimed” items such as this: “Cow Fact:  Mother cows separated from their calves by a fence will moo loudly and seem  very upset. They’ll wait through hunger, cold, and bad weather to be with  their calves.” Smith does not dispute that the mooing actually takes place; if  there is anything about animal psychology that would seem to be pretty well  established, it is mothers’ attachment to their young. But apparently the sug- gestion that this behavior indicates the presence of recognizable emotions is  a dangerously anthropomorphic idea to be putting in the heads of children. Denying  the  obvious  is  a  bad  way  to  go  about  promoting  causes,  even  (or  especially)  very  good  ones.  And  the  emphasis  on  human   exceptionalism —as Smith asks, “What other species builds civilizations,  records  history,  creates  art,  makes  music,  thinks  abstractly,  commu- nicates  in  language,  envisions  and  fabricates  machinery,  improves  life  through science and engineering, or explores the deeper truths found in  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 27 Copyright 2013.

Ingrid Newkirk does not claim that rats and pigs can make machinery  or ponder metaphysics, but that they feel emotions, and that taking those  into  account, we  should not degrade or harm animals  in  the ways  that  matter to them — not by being denied suffrage, say, but by being bored or  scared or separated from their families. Their worth need not be pegged  relative to anybody else’s to acknowledge this. For that matter, Smith’s line of argument serves to undermine his more  important point. The vulnerable and disabled people whom he spends most  of his time fighting to protect are themselves often unable to do a good por- tion of the exceptional things he praises — which is just the sort of limita- tion that causes Peter Singer and his crowd to question their “personhood.”  Arguing from the height of human activity may not be the most persuasive  way to make the case for those who cannot hope to reach that height. On the other hand, as these capacities do have a bearing on the stature  of the species overall,  it ought to  follow that other species with height- ened abilities  should be accorded value  for  those  things as well.  In any  case, tactically speaking, one would think that sensitivity and respect for  life at different levels would find themselves in common cause. We can all  recall examples from human history in which people’s natural sympathies  28 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. Shutterstock </page> <page sequence="20"> Do Elephants Have Souls? towards others, whom they knew deep down to be like them, were closed  off by feats of ideology — and of still more examples where the baseline of  those natural sympathies left much to be desired. Our natural sympathies  represent an invaluable kind of moral insight to be nurtured rather than  squelched wherever they do appear. Without establishing equality per se,  this surely applies to our relationship to animals as well. Staff members at the Elephant Sanctuary told me of an incident with  one of  their  “girls,” who spotted a  fallen bird outside her barn and ran  right over to it, utterly distraught. She crooned and stroked it and did not  settle down till it had been properly laid to rest. What did this mean to  her, exactly? We don’t know. But she was clearly very moved by a fellow  creature’s woe and had no trouble seeing it for what it was, different life  forms though they were. How sad when we, “higher” animals who share  this gift, convince ourselves to dull it. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to  the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all  numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows”  (Matthew 10:29-31). If a single little bird is worth the all-consuming grief  of Dulary the Elephant and the cosmos-animating mind of the Father of  Creation, and human worth surpasses that, then what is there to lose in  holistically appreciating the life of this one bird, even insofar as it resem- bles ours? And how much more than the bird an elephant, which by its own  extraordinary nature shows that all species are not equal — but is a portal  to the world of non-human life, and the possibilities therein. Tool, Image, and Grave The proper study of mankind is man, but when one regards the   elephant, one wonders.  – attributed to Alexander Pope If the core elements of life, sensation, and emotion are so widely distributed  as to encompass a huge swath of the animal kingdom, what is the moral dif- ference between a species with higher capabilities and one without? In his  thoughtful 1985 essay  “Tool,  Image,  and Grave,”  the philosopher of biol- ogy Hans  Jonas  takes up  three activities  attributed  solely  to humans and  explores their deeper implications. As it happens, given what we know today,  elephants arguably meet all three tests. Jonas’s standard is worth revisiting  in this light — not to diminish its significance for Homo sapiens, but to con- sider what it means for the one other animal, at least, that might share it.

The first example is the tool, which Jonas notes  is “very closely connected with the realm of animal necessity.” And yet, a  tool is an artificial construct, not an extension of organic action but a sepa- rate object, often crafted with another object, and most importantly neces- sitating a concept of what it and its purpose will be in order to be crafted. On one count, elephants fail the tool test, for they do not make artifacts  they then reuse (and obviously have not developed the kind of technology  that has completely unleveled the odds in our efforts to hunt or trap or train  them or encroach upon their habitat). However, they do use objects as inter- mediaries between them and their environment, such as sticks to scratch  between their toes and remove bugs from other areas, or twisted clumps of  grass like Q-tips to clean inside their ears or whisks to swat at flies. As J. H.  Williams recounts in Elephant Bill (1950), work elephants in Asia collared  with bells have been known to plug up the bells with mud so that they can  go and steal bananas in the middle of the night unnoticed — a purposeful  modification of someone else’s  tool. Elephants dig holes  for water, cover  them with plugs of bark and grass, and return later to their secret stash.  Elephants learn by trial and error what sorts of materials do and do not  shock  them  in  their  efforts  to  break  through  electric  fences — and  in  at  least one recorded instance (described in Lawrence Anthony’s The Elephant  Whisperer [2009]),  followed the buzzing of the  fence all  the way around  to  its origin,  the generator, which, having been stomped to smithereens,  allowed them to untwine the fence and go their merry way. All these behaviors are oriented directly toward fulfilling basic animal  wants and needs, and all are similar to the kind of instinctual modification  of self and surroundings — hoarding, nesting, sneaking, grooming — that  any animal does to survive  in the world. The sophisticated actions that  animals carry out thanks to the instructions of “instinct” are really quite  amazing, and difficult to comprehend for we who rely so much more on  conscious reasoning; how much does the animal “know,” and how can it do  what it’s doing if it doesn’t? In any case, these complex elephant behav- iors would seem to show a great degree of intelligence, an awareness of  cause and effect, and some grasp of the multiple possibilities inherent in  the properties of their surroundings — that is, what Jonas calls the power  of imagination, a grander power than the cold (though equally applicable)  contemporary phrase “high cognitive capacity.” 30 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="22"> Do Elephants Have Souls? Jonas’s second example, image-making, is a capability which “displays a total, rather than a gradual, divergence from the animal’s.” The activity  is  biologically  useless,  he  notes,  and  requires  sufficient mental  abstrac- tion to distinguish between reality and representation — that is, between  the sensations of the present moment that all animals experience and the  form of something else in memory or the imagination. Image-making is  the transference of this metaphysical idea onto a physical substrate; even  for a portrait or some other picture modeled on something real and pres- ent, the copy is distinct from the original but linked to it by a nonmaterial  concept.* It is worth noting that making images as well as tools depends on not  only sufficient mental abstraction, but more practically hands, or some kind  of hand-like appendage, such as a trunk, something that allows for a special  kind of  active  engagement with environs.  In  fact, given  their prehensile  facility,  elephants can be  trained  to make representational paintings — of  flowers,  balloons,  and  elephants, mainly — just  as  they  can be  trained  to  perform many  other  sophisticated  tricks.  (Given  their  intense  boredom  in captivity, where almost any  activity  can be appealing,  it  is not only a  crowd-pleaser but seemingly fun for the elephants, whose work is then sold  to fund their care and other conservation efforts, otherwise known as win- win-win.) Some elephants, however, make art of their own accord — mostly,  as it appears, abstract, but some bordering on representational. Ruby, who  spent almost her entire life at the Phoenix Zoo and was given paints for  recreation  after  her  keepers  observed  her  always  doodling  in  the  sand,  would commonly select paint colors that matched events around her, such  as visitors’ shirts outside her cage or the red, yellow, and white of a fire  truck that had pulled up with flashing lights earlier in the day. The  best  documented  example,  however,  is  Siri  of  the  Rosamond  Gifford Zoo  in Syracuse, New York, who was observed  in 1980 by her  * More poetically, this idea appears in the 2005 novel/2010 movie Never Let Me Go, con- cerning a group of human clones raised for organ donation. As children in school, they are  encouraged to draw pictures that are spirited away to a “gallery” whose purpose they don’t  know. Various rumors arise to fill the vacuum, among them that the artwork may be used to  match you to your soulmate and perhaps defer your fate, because it “revealed what you were  like inside . . . [it] revealed your soul.” When two of them as adult lovers, desperate to have  this confirmed, track down the madame who had taken custody of all their pictures, she tells  them the art was not so much to reveal their souls as to “prove you had souls at all.” They are  taken aback that anyone would think they didn’t, but that is as naïve as the madame’s belief  that it would mean anything if she could prove they did: the society that produced them to  exploit their bodies is emphatically uninterested in the inconvenient matter of their souls.

The most striking of  these markings was a  little design that  looked for all the world like the  Chinese character for Buddha; the keeper, David Gucwa, bestowed on it  the cheeky and evocative title “To Whom It May Concern,” and from that  point on began to supply her with paper and pencil. He would sit quietly  with  sketch  pad  in  his  lap  and  pencil  sitting  nearby,  and  without  any  prompting or guidance Siri would draw. Many of the drawings — collected in a lovely 1985 book titled after that  first etching, cowritten by Gucwa and reporter James Ehmann — actually  do somewhat resemble corporeal entities: a butterfly, a bird, a person. This  is likely happenstance, though; by and large the drawings are much more  emotionally than rationally expressive. Be that as it may, clearly there was  something in Siri’s inner life she felt compelled to bring forth. The ques- tion of what to make of it is a revealing example of the cryptic expanse  between the intent of the artist and the significance to viewers. To some, of course, the whole thing is simply a send-up of the very  concept of modern art — “people today pay money to acquire stuff that I  would pay money to get rid of,” carped one biology professor sent a packet  of Siri’s work for comment. On the other hand, on being shown the draw- ings two senior zookeepers immediately resolved to go vegetarian, blown  away by this glimpse into an uncharted realm of animal psyches. “I don’t  even step on spiders anymore,” one said, “and I don’t like spiders. Nothing  is simple anymore.” Stephen Jay Gould called the portfolio “fascinating”  but cautioned, “I have a hard enough time assessing my own motivations;  Lord only knows what goes on inside the brain of an elephant.” Art  scholars,  for  their  part — more  content  than  scientists  to  coexist  with endless ambiguity, and indeed to revel in just that kind of clue into the  deep unknown — were universally enthusiastic, all remarking on the energy  and lyricism and even joy, and affirming certain spatial forms and techniques  that indicated the work was more than merely random scribbling. Like the  prehistoric cave paintings Jonas points to, it is a creative message defying  both meaninglessness  and  easy understanding,  calling  across  improbable  distances of time or consciousness or species to whomever it may concern. Incidentally,  in  an  entirely  different  kind  of  “image  test,”  elephants  are distinguished as well: they can recognize themselves in mirrors. Very  few other animals have been shown to do this, mainly dolphins and great  apes. The test is performed as follows: While the animal is unconscious,  some part of its anatomy out of its range of vision is marked with odorless  paint, and often for control a corresponding location is marked with a clear  32 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="24"> Do Elephants Have Souls? version of the paint. When presented with a mirror wherein the mark is  reflected, it turns to that location on its own body to explore it, indicating  both self-awareness and an understanding of the meaning of the mirror.  Human beings begin to pass this test at about eighteen months of age. Jonas’s  final  and  strongest  criterion  is  the  grave,  which  would  seem to  separate  man  from  animal  unambiguously.  The  “commemoration  of the dead perpetuated in the cult of the grave” bespeaks an awareness  of mortality  that  is  the  foundation  of metaphysics:  “in  considering  ‘the  afterwards’ and ‘the there,’ [man] also considers ‘the now’ and ‘the here’  of his existence — that is, he reflects about himself. With graves, the ques- tion takes on concrete form: ‘Where do I come from; where am I going?’  and ultimately, ‘What am I — beyond what I do and experience at a given  time?’” For man, his sense of self, sense of history, and sense of the intem- poral, however inchoate, are gestured at with his remembrance of those  who have passed on. But here he is joined by the elephants, the only other known creatures  that — whatever  it may mean  to  them — purposively commemorate  their  dead,  in  a way  Joyce Poole  calls  “eerie  and deeply moving”:  “It  is  their  silence that is most unsettling. The only sound is the slow blowing of air  out of their trunks as they investigate their dead companion. It’s as if even  the  birds  have  stopped  singing.” Using  their  trunks  and  sensitive  hind  feet, the ones they use for waking up their babies, “they touch the body  ever  so  gently,  circling,  hovering  above,  touching  again,  as  if  by  doing  so they are obtaining information that we, with our more limited senses,  can never understand. Their movements are in slow motion, and then, in  silence, they may cover the dead with leaves and branches.” After burying the body in brush and dirt,  family members may stay  silently with it for over a day; or if a body is found unattended by elephants  not related to it, they may pause and stand by for some time. They do this  with any dead elephant, recently deceased or long departed with only the  skeleton remaining. “It is probably the single strangest thing about them,”  Cynthia Moss writes: Even bare, bleached old elephant bones will stop a group if they have  not  seen  them before.  It  is  so predictable  that  filmmakers have been  able  to  get  shots  of  elephants  inspecting  skeletons  by  bringing  the  bones from one place and putting them in a new spot near an elephant  pathway or a water hole.

It  is a haunting  and touching sight and I have no idea why they do it. Understandably, for many years it was rumored that elephants had designat- ed graveyards. This has proved essentially untrue, although their skeletons  often do collect in the same place, such as near a water hole, where the ailing  and elderly tend to stay towards the end of their lives — and as Moss notes,  sometimes do get moved around. The mother of a dead baby may drape it  over her tusks and carry it with her for days, if she is not standing vigil. Elephants even react to carved ivory, long divorced from the original  remains  and  altered  and  handled  extensively.  Poole writes  of  a woman  “Eerie and deeply moving”: Temporal glands streaming with heightened emotion,  elephants stroke and lay brush on a dead friend. 34 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

Poole  then had  a  friend  stage  a  repeat  performance  later,  and  the  same  thing  happened. Conversely, elephants have also been observed to become quiet  and pensive in an area where relatives died, even years ago, although the  bones have long been removed. While elephants are unfailingly interested in the remains of their own  kind in whatever form, they have occasionally been known to bury dead  rhinos,  lions,  and  humans  as well.  In  some  cases,  the  people were  only  sleeping, and awoke to find themselves trapped under enormous heaps of  foliage. Other times, they have been injured or paralyzed with fear by a  furious elephantine rampage, which came to an abrupt end when the ele- phant perceived them lying still on the ground, and switched in an instant  from ferocious self-defense to solemnly performing its rites for the dead. The Half-Reasoning Animal “Creatures, I give you yourselves,”  said the strong, happy voice of Aslan.  “I give to you forever this land of Narnia. I give you the woods, the  fruits, the rivers. I give you the stars and I give you myself. The Dumb  Beasts whom I have not chosen are yours also. Treat them gently and  cherish them but do not go back to their ways lest you cease to be Talking  Beasts. For out of them you were taken and into them you can return.”  – C. S. Lewis, The Magician’s Nephew For those who find this type of evidence sentimentalized, dubiously inter- pretable, or otherwise unsatisfactory, there are various nice solid measure- ments that provide useful but crude indicators of elephants’ relative intel- ligence. At birth, an elephant brain is about a third its adult size. A human  brain at birth is a quarter its adult size, whereas for chimps it is half and  for most mammals  the  figure  is more  like 90 percent. A greater  span of  growth outside the womb like this accompanies a more important role that  nurture and learned skills play in the animal’s maturation — as infants they  are more helpless and dependent than an average mammal, but as adults  there will be much more that they can do. The elephant brain is also notable  for its high level of spindle neurons (associated with sociability), very large   temporal lobes and hippocampus (the primary seat of memory processing),  and convoluted neocortex (linked to general cognitive complexity, common  to other intelligent species such as dolphins and higher-order primates).

And in the category of things you  might be prone to romanticize, at the very top there is a faculty that also  tops the  list of  features supposed to distinguish man from animal — and  that could, if properly deciphered, unlock the rest of elephant experience  for us in a way nothing else will. “The Romans fancied that the elephants  had reason, and understood the language of men, though they could not  answer them,” the nineteenth-century historian John Ranking observed.  The Romans were not alone. What elephants may be lacking most of all  is not language but the Rosetta Stone to prove they have it and clue us in  to what on God’s green earth they’re talking about all the time. Animal  communication  is  a  tricky  subject. Even  comparatively  lowly  critters have mind-boggling ways of signaling information to each other.  Bees, to convey to other bees the location of home or food or some other  desired destination, perform a “bee waggle dance” that simulates the direc- tions in scaled-down form — and there are different “dialects” for this chore- ography as practiced by the same species in different regions of the world.  A mother bat returning to the cave with food for her little one can some- how instantly pick out his specific cheeping from the thousands of others  huddled on the wall. There is even just the detailed social profile of all the  neighbor dogs your pet checks out from sniffing hydrants on his walk. However, this sort of thing does not necessarily rise to the level con- sidered worthy of the label “language” — though determining where that  level should be is hard to say. Even taking into account the impressiveness  of all  these  forms of  interchange, and the  fact  that  there  is much about  them yet to be discovered and explained, we risk defining the term out of  its useful meaning if we stretch it to encompass so much that human (or  humanlike) powers of complex abstract discourse cease to be recognizably  extraordinary. “Since time immemorial [speech] has been correctly acknowledged to be  man’s most outstanding trait,” Jonas wrote (though not addressing it in his  own essay). There is an intricate philosophical link at least in the Western  tradition between language and beliefs and choices, and thus moral reason- ing and self-determination. (Cultures with a higher general estimation of  animals than ours may not precisely share this view, or may just accept that  animals have language that is obscure to people. It is interesting to consider  how the everyday proximity to different kinds of creatures may have affected  the development of these beliefs. That is, elephants, higher-order primates,  38 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="30"> Do Elephants Have Souls? and the like are not native to the West, and thus our basic common sense  of what “animals” can think or do calibrates at the level of, say, horses and  dogs — not to malign the intelligence of horses and dogs, which we tend to  underappreciate anyway. But in Asia and Africa, where there’s been much  more natural interaction between people and very smart animals — and not  as novelties but as members of other communities — most cultures seem to  take a more expansive view of animal potential.) For  a  careful  analysis  of  the  language  question  from  the Western  philosophical perspective, the interested reader may turn to virtue ethi- cist Alasdair MacIntyre’s Dependent Rational Animals (1999), which walks  through  the  discussion  on  this  point  while  focusing  especially  on  the  example of dolphins. Reminding us that “much that is intelligent animal  in  us  is  not  specifically  human,”  MacIntyre  goes  to  battle  with  some  residual  Cartesian  silliness,  and  takes  care  (as many  philosophers  have  not) to locate animals on a spectrum of higher and lesser intelligence — a  dog, for instance, may have more in common with a person than with a  crab  in most significant respects — drawing out the  implications at each  stage till he arrives at conscious action. A more distilled, whimsical presentation appears in C. S. Lewis’s alle- gorical world  of Narnia,  with  the  contrast  between  ordinary  creatures  and the “Talking Beasts.” Their animal natures give them certain innate  qualities — steadfastness in a bear, valor in a horse — but their speech gives  them control  over  their  animal  instincts  by  the powers  of  thought  and  self-direction it endows. They are the moral equals of human characters  because  of  this,  and  anyone who  treats  them  as  equivalent  to  ordinary  animals instead is sure to be suspect in other ways. Late in the Narnia series there is a montage of creation, showing how  Aslan, the Christ  figure,  first drew them out  from among ordinary ani- mals and called them into being. They sing: “We hear and obey. We are  awake. We love. We think. We speak. We know” — all things that would  be impossible without their new awareness. And Aslan, instructing them, says first and foremost that he gives them  themselves. In one sense, the power to rise above your instinct is the power  to be other  than you are,  to not be your  “natural”  self. But  in  a deeper  sense,  it  is  the power  to be who you most  are,  to  take  responsibility  for  what you think and do and to guide yourself towards the better (or not). Can elephants do that? We know they undergo extensive education: babies from their whole doting families, newly fertile cows guided by the more experienced,  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 39 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

In situations where these teaching opportunities are absent — babies  orphaned  or  separated,  cows  giving  birth  alone  in  zoos,  teenage males  running rampant  in places where all  the older bulls have been shot  for  their tusks — their necessity is obvious. As good a guide as inborn instinct  is in so many respects, this is one animal for which society, too, makes all  the difference in the world. While  much  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  better  elephant  is  conveyed  by example — along with ear  flaps,  trunk movements, smell signals, and  other  forms of body language — elephants vocalize prodigiously as well,  engaging  in elaborate discussions as part of every activity. They have a  vocal range of ten octaves (a piano has seven), and up to three-quarters  of the sounds they produce are inaudible to human ears. Their infrasonic  calls have been studied extensively by Katy Payne, a whale-call specialist  who in 1984 found herself at the Portland Zoo observing elephants com- municating “silently” through concrete walls. The “throbbing” or “shud- dering” in the air reminded her of a bass line on an organ that descended  past  the  point  of  hearing.  In  subsequent  months  at  the  zoo  and  years  in the field, she recorded and deciphered many of these low frequencies  with the help of spectrogram analysis and Joyce Poole, who had already  learned to recognize dozens of the rumbles, hoots, trumpets, and whistles  that  are  audible:  “let’s  go,”  “I’m  lost,”  different  referents  to  family  and  nonfamily members, and more. (Conversely, like other trainable animals,  captive elephants have a minimal familiarity with human languages, rec- ognizing many words  spoken by  their  caretakers. Recently,  an  elephant  named Koshik at a South Korean zoo even took it upon himself to learn  to articulate human speech sounds: by sticking his trunk in his mouth, he  can conform it to say hello, no, sit down, lie down, and good in Korean. In  1983, there were reports of an elephant in Kazakhstan named Batyr who  could say “Batyr is good” in Russian and twenty other phrases, but they  were not followed up on scientifically.) The work, tantalizing but in early  stages yet, continues at the Elephant Listening Project. Meanwhile,  Caitlin  O’Connell-Rodwell,  originally  an  insect  biolo- gist,  got  involved  when  the Namibian  government  hired  her  to  attack  the perennial  problem of keeping  elephants  from raiding  crops. Fences,  ditches, sirens, and border rows of chili peppers had all failed to protect  local  farmers’  livelihoods or were  impracticable to maintain. O’Connell- Rodwell’s solution was to  isolate a particular elephant alarm call out of  a recording of layered vocalizations and rig it up to play back when they  came too close. The reaction was astonishing: with none of the customary  40 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Her larger finding, however, recounted in her 2007 book The Elephant’s  Secret Sense, was to prove that they communicate not only infrasonically  but  seismically — through waves  in  the ground. This  radically  expanded  their known range of contact, indicating that they can keep tabs on who  is where and what is going on by footfalls many miles away. Elephant  feet are padded with a kind of  fat, similar to that  found in  aquatic mammals, that  is  ideal  for acoustic transmission. (In fact,  it was  once used for candle oil, just like whale blubber.) Seismic waves traveling  through the ground are picked up by the padding and transmitted up the  foot and leg bones to the head, where smaller pockets of the same fat con- nect to the auditory system. (Because  of  this  enhanced  pedestrian  sensitivity,  the  feet  are  also  especially  susceptible  to distress — sometimes,  as Mark Shand writes  in  his 1999 book Travels on My Elephant, when an elephant goes rogue, it is  because a stick that it was using to clean between its toes has splintered  off  and  lodged  in  out  of  reach.  And  severe  elephant  foot  problems  are  depressingly common in zoos and other captive situations, where the ani- mals must stand on concrete so much of the time instead of walking long  distances over soft dirt and vegetation.)

Long before Payne and O’Connell-Rodwell’s work,  when  early  ethologists  were  just  getting  the  lay  of  the  land  and  using  radio  tracking  to monitor  elephant movements,  they were baffled by  the  elephants’ ability to seemingly coordinate across long distances and change  course near-simultaneously, regardless of wind direction (and thus scent) or  any other explanation they could think of. “We didn’t mention ESP openly,”  said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, but “some of us were ready to entertain the  idea that these animals were sending bloody mind waves to each other.” With  hard  work  and  careful  observation,  a  better  explanation  was  eventually forthcoming, as there may one day be for other elephant-relat- ed phenomena that seem a little spooky. Many people, for instance, report  a  kind  of  sixth  sense  about  when  an  elephant  is  in  the  area,  one  they  cannot  actually  perceive  in  any  identifiable way  but  seem  almost  never  to be wrong about. Poole describes it as “a vibrancy in the air, a certain  warmth,” or by contrast “a stillness, an emptiness” in the landscape when  elephants are absent. Conceivably,  this  elephant  radar may be produced  by the talking tremors, felt viscerally rather than audibly — but less obvi- ously explicable is Poole’s similar sense of whether she is about to find a  carcass with ivory attached. Lyall Watson’s fascinating 2002 book Elephantoms  is largely devoted  to exploring this sort of not-intrinsically-unreasonable event that verges  on  the  uncanny.  One  of  his  more  straightforward  stories  concerns  an  incident witnessed by a ranger in Addo Park, South Africa, home to a line  of elephants with special historical reasons to distrust human beings. An  effort to repair a fence had resulted in a mother and baby being stranded  on opposite sides of it. Becoming very agitated as the workers approached,  the  ranger  said,  the  cow  “stopped,  put her  trunk  through  the  cables  to  calm the calf and seemed to be thinking about her next move.” He said  he could not prove what happened next, nor did the other rangers believe  him, but this is what he saw: She talked to that kid. She told him exactly what to do, and without  any  further  fuss, he did. He turned out away  from her and the  fence  and went  into the deep shade of a  tree twenty yards away, where he  42 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

I knew exactly where  he was, but could hardly find him again when I looked away. I saw her  rush down to the gap and out onto the road, and as the truck appeared,  she raised a huge cloud of dust, stamping and blowing, making short  charges at the vehicle, frightening the crew sufficiently to get them to  back off and go away. . . .And when the noise and confusion was at its  height,  the  calf  in  camouflage made his move. He  sidled  over  to  the  fence,  slipped quietly  through  the gap,  and went over  to wait  in  the  cover of the succulent forest. I was  certain  then  that  the  cow’s  entire  performance  had  been  a  brilliant diversion, beautifully executed, for as soon as she was sure he  had made good his escape, she ignored the truck and its occupants and  turned her back, sashaying in satisfaction back to join her calf in the  safety of the park. Evidently  it  is  not  uncommon  for  those  who  spend  their  time  out  monitoring or at least mingling with wildlife to witness occurrences that  go beyond conventional assumptions about what animals can know or do.  When “elephant whisperer” Lawrence Anthony died in 2012, the two herds  of traumatized rogue elephants he had saved and resocialized crossed the  vast South African game reserve where they lived, apparently to pay their  last respects. The elephants had not been anywhere near the house for a  year and a half prior, Anthony’s son reported, and the trek across the park  could take a day, but within hours of his death they all showed up. Payne  writes  of  a  conversation  she  had  with  a  senior  scout  from  Ntaba Mangwe  park  in which  she  asked  him  how  he  speaks  of  events  that seem to be outside normal experience. “YOU JUST TELL WHAT  HAPPENED,” he  surprised her with a  shout and burning stare.  “YOU  JUST TELL WHAT YOU SAW!” “You must simply tell what happened,” he repeated quietly as she sat  there in shock. “Only God knows what it means.” Unpacking  this  remarkable  exchange  yields  several  items  of  note.  First, there is the dynamic presence of the unknown in daily life. Second,  there is the question of what to do about it. Because it is unknown does  not mean that it is necessarily unknowable — nor that it isn’t. The choice  to  tell  about  it  represents  a hopeful  effort  that  it might be understood,  though  not  a  presumptive  one:  there  is  no  undue  effort  to  explain,  to  impose some kind of theory on it, but an openness to whatever it might  reveal.  But  finally,  on  the  optimistic  side  of  understanding,  there  is  a  reminder  of  the  awesome  significance  of  language  in  the  urging  to  tell  what happened.

You just tell what happened, and someone else will hear it. The website LettersOfNote.com is a wonderful, weird archive of real  epistles  between  all  kinds  of  people  in  all  times  and  places.  A  striking  proportion  of  them,  however,  seem  to  be  letters  from  former  slaves  to  their erstwhile masters — some forgiving and generous, some righteously  sly, a few burning with revenge, all at varying degrees of written literacy,  but uniformly powerful for this reason: they say, I have a mind. I have an  independent soul that never once belonged to you although my labor and all the  circumstances of my life unjustly did. You found it convenient to believe that I  was not a thinking, feeling person just like you — no doubt supported by elaborate  rationalizations from the whole world around us which ought to have known  better — but you cannot deny this anymore, because here I am, free and awake. I  love. I think. I speak. I know. It must be emphasized that the direct comparison here is not from the  harm and injustice of animal captivity to those of human slavery, but in  the ability to command the attention of someone in power who does not  want to acknowledge them at all. To the extent that elephants and other  animals have  thoughts and memories and  feelings and experiences  that  they are capable of expressing in their own tongue, what a disadvantage  it  is  to  them  that we have not  cracked  that  code. Our  failure  to under- stand them means that there is no way we can truly assess the limits of  their abilities or say for sure what they are not saying, and makes it easy  to ignore their validity for anyone with reason to. No animal is going to  come  forward with a written missive  in a humanly comprehensible  lan- guage detailing wrongs or simply proving in our own terms the scope of  its existence — that, at least, is an ability that is distinctly ours. But if they  could, they would have a lot to tell. Of Love and Liberty When I saw this place, I told her that there’d be no more chains. She’s  free now.

But because  the elephant is so intriguing, it has been dragooned into any number of  unhappy circumstances, out of a sometimes  innocent, sometimes  less so  human wish to penetrate or possess its mystery. My first direct encounter with an elephant took the form of a trunk  tip materializing in my lap as I sat in a covered motor rickshaw in down- town Pune, Maharashtra. What  do  you  do with  the  sudden  apparition  of  a writhing, disembodied nose? Apparently you place  a  coin  inside  it.  This coin is relayed to the collection of the nose’s owner’s rider sitting up  top and steering his charge through the chaos of Indian traffic, where he  gets to make your day by gracing it with an elephant and you get to give  him money. I met another elephant a few weeks later, standing outside a  temple dispensing “blessings” in exchange for a coin for the handler and,  if you felt like it, a banana for the elephant, which would be eaten peel and  all. Then, for one magical moment, the trunk was laid across the crown of  your head in benediction. I stood in line with coins and bananas getting  blessings all afternoon. These were  both  thrilling  experiences,  but  looking  back,  those  ele- phants were conscripted into unhealthy, lonely lives precisely because of  the monetary potential  in  tourists  like me.  In  the same vein but worse,  luxury resorts in Thailand keep baby elephants on hand to entertain and  delight  visitors. Where  and  how  these  babies  are  obtained — and  what  becomes of them when they are more than a year or two old and no longer  useful for the purpose — is a dismal thing to contemplate; and in any case,  no elephant that young is well off separated from its mother and family,  no matter how lavish the accommodations. Trained elephants in Asia have a celebrated but disintegrating history.  Numerous  Sanskrit  texts  on  elephantology  reveal  tremendous  respect  for  the  power  and  dignity  of  elephants  and  the  care  that  was  taken  to  understand and treat them humanely. A “mahout,” the elephant’s keeper/ trainer/companion, would ideally stay with the same animal for life, almost  as  if  in marriage  (though the other kind of marriage  fit  into  the picture  somewhere, as this was a trade often passed on from father to son). With globalization, mahout culture is going the way of other old tra- ditions. It is less of a family business, the training is more slapdash, and  many of  the men who would make  the most  affectionate  and dedicated  elephant companions find, understandably, that they have better opportu- nities elsewhere. As Stephen Alter writes in Elephas Maximus: A Portrait  of the Indian Elephant  (2004),  this  leaves  the kind of men who have  few  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 45 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

The result is neglect, misunderstanding, conflict  and abuse, and bitter frustration on both sides, feeding on itself for more  of the same. But the demand for service and show elephants is only going  up, and someone has to take care of them. Meanwhile, the rest of the world naturally wants in on the elephant  action — who wouldn’t? — and so came the diaspora. As  early  as  the  ninth  century,  with  a  present  from  Caliph  Harun  al-Rashid  to  Charlemagne,  elephants  were  offered  as  special  gifts  to  European royalty and marched from court to court until they died of cold  and loneliness. A few such stories have been fictionalized — Nobel laureate  José  Saramago’s The Elephant’s Journey  (2008,  translated  2010);  young- adult fantasy author Judith Tarr’s His Majesty’s Elephant (1993); and BBC  World Service producer Christopher Nicholson’s bleakly enchanting first  novel The Elephant Keeper  (2009). Set  in eighteenth-century England,  it  begins with the purchase by a respected gentleman of two half-dead baby  elephants  from  a merchant  ship  just  returned  from  the  East  Indies.  A  stable boy, Tom, takes a shine to them, is made responsible for their care,  and becomes inseparable from one of them forever.  (The other is resold  and eventually killed.) Tom’s attachment to this elephant, Jenny, opens his eyes to the quag- mire of human motivation  that gives  rise  to  the unjust world  they  live  in. Like many other stories, the presence of an animal as a key character  offers a compelling stand-in for those members of society who don’t have  power  and metaphorically  can’t  speak  for  themselves.* Sometimes,  they  become tales of a sympathetic human finding his own voice to represent  those who literally cannot. Tom, however, is not simply a hero or a victim. His devotion to Jenny  also  leads him to betray his sweetheart, abandon his  family,  ignore grave  evil,  and  descend  into  a  sordid  London  underworld  whose  misery  he  actively contributes to. In every choice that arises for Tom between Jenny  and another person, he knows he can’t leave Jenny because there is literally  no one else on earth who will protect her. She is “only an Elephant,” after  all, and not entitled to the same basic social claims as people. But since she  *  In addition  to  those mentioned above, Coco Hall’s 2009 graphic novel Elephant Girl  makes this point with parallel stories of human trafficking and animal captivity. Based  on real events, it follows the abduction from a remote Indian forest and transfer to Los  Angeles of a young girl and an elephant, whose various appealing qualities are exploited  in the ways they often are. 46 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

Tom’s unusual connection to her puts him in  limbo between two realms which are perhaps impossible to integrate — not  because animals are too different from us, but because they are too alike. Involving any animals in our society — for entertainment, companion- ship, labor, or other purposes — places them in an awkward category. They  don’t belong and cannot in any meaningful way participate in human sys- tems of political representation, but they have interests to be represented all  the same, many of which are close enough to ours that to exploit or ignore  them is an obvious injustice. (The more dissimilar needs may expose them  to injustice too, of course, but in ways that are less readily apparent.) But as  long as there is human life there will be some use being made of animals — and the animals on whom we depend will depend even more on us. The history of elephants  in  the United States might have proceeded in all kinds of peculiar directions had Abraham Lincoln accepted the  King of Siam’s 1861 offer of a breeding pair, to be released into the for- est to found an American dynasty. Lincoln, having a few other matters to  attend to and reckoning that this was the last thing he needed, gracefully  declined. (Later, one of his final acts as president, on the afternoon of the  day he was shot, was to instruct his staff to let go a Confederate spy who  was  trying to  flee  to England:  “When you have got an elephant by  the  hind leg, and he’s trying to run away, it’s best to let him run.”) There being no native dynasty, the ones that came arrived as curiosi- ties. Where  in European  courts  they  stood  for majesty  and might,  and  in Hindu and Buddhist settings for the wisdom and sacredness of animal  life, in America they morphed to fit the national tendencies to uprooted- ness, exhibitionism, and making a buck — a theme suggested  in a movie  idea the author James Agee outlined in the last letter he wrote before his  death in 1955: At the beginning, elephants converge from all over Africa, towards a  disembodied voice, the voice of God, which addresses them roughly as  follows: “My children: you know that you are my chosen people. You  know  that — to  you  alone — I  have  given my  secret:  I  do  not  regard  myself as omnipotent. I gave that up when I gave to Man the Will to  love me or to hate me, or merely to disregard me. So I can promise you  nothing. What little I can tell you is neither encouraging nor discour- aging.

Nor have you ever been improved nor disimproved in that process. But  now, a new age begins. Soon, now, you will be taken to be looked upon,  to be regarded as strange and as wonderful and — forgive me, my dear  ones — as funny. As I said, I am not omnipotent; I can’t even prophesy:  I ask only  this: be your own good selves, always  faithfully, always  in  knowledge of my love and regard, and through so being, you may con- vert those heathen, those barbarians, where all else has failed.” During  this  admonition,  and  blessing,  the  oldest  elephant  sadly  leaves the assembly, and walks away to the great, secret, elephant cem- etery, and dies there. Soon after, men come among the elephants,  and capture  them  for  circuses. Agee  imagined subsequent scenes based on real events  in American  elephantine history, beginning with Old Bet, the centerpiece of an exotic  traveling menagerie, who was reportedly shot by a Maine farmer in 1816,  believing her to be the unholy behemoth of old. A  later scene concerns  another circus elephant, Mary, who was lynched in Tennessee in 1916 fol- lowing an altercation with a brutal keeper — an event that, although Agee  never made his movie of it, has been dramatized for the stage three times:  Mark  Medoff ’s  Big Mary  (1989),  George  Brant’s  Elephant’s Graveyard  (2007), and Caleb Lewis’s Clinchfield  (2009). As a proxy  for more  tradi- tional,  less newsworthy  lynchings,  this  ill-starred  elephant  seems  to be  the nonpareil. All these accounts, in their way, are trying to say something  of the clash between what turn out to be two inverse evils: the bigoted,  airtight  provincialism  of  the  town  proper,  and  the  gaudy,  sordid  disas- sociation of traveling circus life — that is, being someone entirely because  you are from somewhere, or being from nowhere at all. Mary happened to  be so unfortunate as to drop into this unneighborly maw. For her and Agee’s other sacrificial innocents sent on their great com- mission  to  reform  the wicked human heart,  it  is  uncertain whether  the  effort is thus proved a failure, even bringing out the worst in those they  came to save, or if there is a greater meaning in their suffering that points  toward redemption. Agee’s non-omniscient, non-omnipotent God leaves  that to our own conclusions, as the finale, also based on a historical event,  takes the elephants from dignified abasement to oblique transcendence: The greatest choreographer of his time, George Balanchine, instructs  the greatest elephant corps of any  time,  in ballet.

But all  through the performance, people roar with joy at their clumsiness, and  their dutifulness. The elephants are deeply shamed. Later that night,  the wisest of  them, extending his  trunk,  licks up a dying cigar-butt,  and drops it in fresh straw. All 36 elephants die in the fire. Their huge  souls,  light as clouds, settle  like doves,  in the great cemetery back in  Africa. And  perhaps  God  speaks,  tenderly,  again;  perhaps  saying,  “The  Peace of God, which passeth all understanding. . . ” etc. The  true  story  of  this  bizarre  collaboration  came  about  as  follows:  “I wonder  if you’d  like to do a  little ballet with me,” the choreographer  suggested to the composer,  “a polka, perhaps.”  “For whom?” Stravinsky  asked.  “For  some  elephants,”  Balanchine  replied.  “How  old?”  “Very  young.” There was a long pause. “All right,” said Stravinsky, “if they are  very young  elephants,  I will  do  it.”  (Stravinsky  later  remarked  that his  music was best understood by children and animals.) In contrast to Agee’s  rendering,  historical  reports  suggest  that  the  dancers may  in  fact  have  enjoyed their routine, appearing to take pride in mastering and perform- ing it together. However,  in  other  circumstances,  distressed  elephants  have  been  known  to  kill  themselves  in ways  that  certainly  seem  intentional — not  only by refusing food and water, but by stepping on their trunks to suf- focate, or deliberately tightening chains hung around their throats. Under  the  circumstances,  these  actions  seem  much  closer  to  despair  than  to  fatal  stupidity.  Other  perverse  behaviors,  such  as  the  way  cows  giving  birth sometimes turn on their newborns, are never seen anywhere but in   captivity. Catching  an  elephant  from  the  wild  is  a  tumultuous  process  that  often involves the deaths of several more in the melee. Less brutally, but  rather creepily, it may also entail the complicity of other elephants, who  are trained to entice their wild kin into a compromising situation where  they  can be  caught.  (Another way of  catching  elephants,  employed  less  now than it used to be, is to save the babies from a cull and market them.  Because of the psychological problems caused by having their entire fami- lies slaughtered around them, culling experts now recommend just killing  the babies with everybody else.) In transit, captive elephants are subject  to extreme discomfort and often die from overheating, freezing, stifling,  dehydration, or infection. To  avoid  these  problems, many  zoos  and  other  institutions  seeking  elephants have attempted captive breeding programs, which they bill as a  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 49 Copyright 2013.

The  2008 anthology Elephants and Ethics,  an outgrowth of a Disney Animal  Kingdom-funded conference, is a detailed guidebook to this and the many  other ins and outs of elephant captivity. (A few chapters deal with global  issues  such  as  poaching  and  culling,  but  overall  it  is  a  very Western-  oriented handbook, as the vast bulk is concerned with the small minority  of elephants held in zoos and circuses.) The book gets deep in the weeds  of this stuff with some weird dilemmas. The managers of captive-breeding  programs, for example, would by and large like to avoid birthing male ele- phants because they are hard to house as they grow older — they can’t be  kept with the female groups that live together, they can’t be kept in close  quarters with other males,  and  they are  especially dangerous  to handle  when  they  start  going  into  musth.  Breeders  correctly  sense  that  sex-  selective abortion would be a nonstarter with the public; would in vitro  fertilization with screened embryos be any better? Would it be possible? A step or two back from this thicket, the primary question becomes  whether it is morally defensible to keep elephants captive at all. Although  they are  the  “keystone species” of zoos — by  far  the number one attrac- tion demanded by the public — some zoo officials, in Philadelphia, Detroit,  the Bronx, and elsewhere, have in the past few years bravely closed their  elephant exhibits and sent the residents to a sanctuary, wildlife park, or  other more suitable home, having reached the conclusion that they were  unequipped to provide an ethically acceptable standard of living. Most zoos are having a harder time letting go, a struggle exemplified  by the 2004 attempt of Alaska Zoo officials to hang on to Maggie, the sole  elephant in the state. Because of Alaska’s climate, Maggie had to spend up  to ten months of the year standing around indoors in her concrete pen,  isolated, cold, unhealthy, and bored silly. Amid calls for her removal to a  warmer  area  and more  appropriate  living  situation,  zoo  leaders  instead  decided to raise money to build her a $100,000 treadmill — which, after  much  fanfare at  its  installation,  she could not be prevailed upon  to use.  Eventually they gave in, and in 2007 she was relocated to a sanctuary in  California. The point is not that elephants are treated cruelly by their handlers.  While there is no shortage of examples of harsh or negligent treatment,  many — probably most — zookeepers and circus  trainers have close  rela- tionships with their elephants and may even love them intensely. But the  contexts  that  bring  them  together  are  fundamentally  inhumane.  Carol  Buckley,  the  founder of  the Elephant Sanctuary who  started out  in  the  circus industry, writes that “I’ve known people in this business for thirty  50 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

Elephants remain a major attraction of the circus industry in the United States and around  the world. Here, an audience watches elephants perform in a French circus in 2011. years. I know they love elephants. What I have had to learn to understand  is you can love someone in a very dysfunctional way.” Certainly zoo standards have been evolving for the better, and most  institutions  strive  to  create  the  best  possible  habitat  for  their  animals  within the limits of their resources. And the key point they emphasize in  their defense is the educational value and the resulting benefits to all ele- phants everywhere. As Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey veterinarian  Dennis Schmitt writes in Elephants and Ethics, “The connection between a  live elephant and the public is undeniable. People remember the first time  they visited a circus and saw a live elephant. How many people remember  and talk about the first time they read about an elephant in a book or saw  an  elephant on TV?” Circuses  can offer  elephants  as  “ambassadors,” he  continues, and “build awareness of all the other elephants in the world.”  (Presumably zoos are even better equipped to do this.) By falling in love  with the one elephant they have seen, the argument goes, people will be  inspired and informed to go out and help elephants generally. Whatever may be the instrumental value of these involuntary ambas- sadors,  it  is a diminished kind of love that keeps its object confined and  unhappy.

The very awe of its magnificence and power was what made the elephant  such  desirable  game. The  hunter,  in  tracking  and  conquering  his  prey,  seeks in some way to seize for himself that glorious force of life the ani- mal displays. The catch is that, as soon as you have shot the animal, that  force of life is gone — the instant it is at your touch it has already eluded  you,  belonging  to  no  one  anymore.  Famous  photographs  of  Roosevelt  towering  athwart  felled  giants  exude  an  eerie  combination  of  tremen- dous manly pride (generally, the sex that brings life into the world seems  content with that primal connection to it, and is less interested in taking  it back out) and utter negation; the deanimated lump no longer conveys  anything but the material presence of piercing loss. Or, as Poole says of  the poached corpses that she finds: “There is something so grand about  the life of an elephant, its great size, strength, and age, that in death its  loss  is  equally monumental. To have  taken so many years and eaten so  many trees, to have become so big; to have roamed the earth as King of  Beasts and then to have collapsed in a piece of rotting flesh is tragic and  so seemingly wasteful of life.” Adult elephants have no predator other than man. (Babies may some- times be preyed upon by  lions  and  the  like;  to protect  them,  the moms  and aunts circle around the small ones, facing outwards to give any inter- ested comers the evil eye. This proves sufficiently intimidating.) They are   occasionally hunted by some African tribes for meat or as a rite of passage,  but not (to these ends) in great numbers. Meanwhile,  opportunities  now  exist  at  certain  game  reserves  for  those aspiring to the masculinity of Teddy Roosevelt to pay great sums  of money  to  chase  the  animals  around  a  large  pen  in  a  jeep,  that  is,  a  confined hunting zone where there is no real test of strength or match of  wits and they are ultimately guaranteed a kill. These are often couched as  conservation efforts — attaching a high price to elephants makes each one  “valuable” from the perspective of the local community, and the money can  ostensibly be spent on some worthy elephant-related cause.* * There is a new, gentler alternative in “green hunting,” where elephants and other large  game are stalked and shot with tranquilizing darts. Hunters get the thrill of the chase,  biologists get  the  chance  to  approach  the doped-out  animal  for  any needed  testing or  tracking purposes, contributions to the animals’ upkeep may be made for the privilege,  and  no  one  gets  hurt.  This  is,  however,  a  very minor  phenomenon,  and  even  so  has   problems of its own. Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 53 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

When with a  heavy heart, Mr. Choudhury finally corners him in the forest and shoots, His trunk whipped back in the air. His mouth opened wide, revealing  his writhing black tongue. He reared up on his hind legs, kicking out  defiantly. Then the fight went out of him. His ears fell to his sides. His trunk  flagged. His head slumped as if he was overcome with fatigue. Like a  disgraced child who only now understood that he had misbehaved, the  rogue tried to turn and walk away, almost apologetically. Then, in one violent movement, he reared up once again, his trunk  reaching for the sky as if he was trying to clutch at his departing soul.  He let out a tortured, rasping noise. Then his legs buckled. His body  slumped forward. And he dropped to the ground with a thud, his tusks  driving into the soft earth. Within hours, hundreds of people have materialized to mourn the pass- ing  of  a  hathi,  so  upset  that  the  hunting  party,  reluctant  as  they were,  even  fear  for  their own safety.  Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who also had  to  dispatch a menace once, reports a similar emotional experience: “It was  the only  time  I  ever  shot an elephant,  and when  I  saw  the  sudden col- lapse of this marvelous organism which tumbled down a steep bank like  a deflated paper bag,  I  found  it  incomprehensible  that people should do  this for pleasure.”  Now picture scaling this up — to a hundred elephants, a hundred thou-sand, a million. That is the upshot of the poaching explosion of recent  history. And while safari hunting at least represents, however perversely,  an appreciation for the total majesty of the animal, this massacre implies  a different valuation of elephants altogether, one where their whole worth  is in the ivory they grow. An elephant’s tusk, useful to its owner for everything from digging to  defense, is blessed and cursed with a strength, texture, and beauty unique  among natural  (and  even  artificial)  substances;  it  has,  as Cynthia Moss  writes, “an incandescence and warmth unlike any other material used for  ornaments or sculpture.” The first ivory crisis occurred in the nineteenth  century, with colonial forays into Africa and Southeast Asia yielding exotic  exports such as carvings and piano keys newly affordable to people of an  industrialized Europe and United States. In 1800, there were 26 million  elephants roaming Africa alone; in less than two centuries, the population  54 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

Steve Bloom, photographer of a gorgeous 2006  elephant image collection, notes the irony that “so many elephants were  sacrificed to make those very instruments through which the human soul  is expressed. Pianists would unleash their feelings and reach out to others  through the physical medium of an elephant’s  tusk. These animals died  for our music.” A modern variation on the theme  is  illustrated  in a recent National  Geographic magazine  feature  on  the  religious  icons  and  other  carvings  being produced in an increasingly wealthy Asia, now the world’s major  ivory market. Spectacular photos of these pieces sit in contrast to grue- some ones of slaughtered elephants and sordid heaps of dirty tusks — but  also  to  some  of  live  elephants,  unperturbed  and  minding  their  own  business,  dirty  tusks  still  on  them,  just  as  nature  intended.  Few  other  accounts  show  all  these  things  together,  and  the  combination  is  star- tling:  here  is  raw nature,  here  is  the  exquisite  potential  in  it  that  only  civilization — human artists — can fulfill, and here  is the bloody price of  that fulfillment. And, strictly speaking, it is not civilization but its breakdown that is  responsible for these artifacts, since killing elephants for  ivory has been  illegal for decades. Commercial  trafficking  in  Asian  elephant  parts  was  outlawed  by  ratification  of  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species  (CITES)  in  1975.  The  1980s  saw  the  population  of  African  elephants  drop  by more  than  half,  from  1.3 million  to  600,000, which  though initially attributed to habitat loss turned out to be the result of  the skyrocketing ivory trade. Leading up to the 1990 CITES conference,  rumors  abounded  that  the African  elephant was going  to be placed on  the protected list, as indeed it was, making all international trade in new  ivory illegal. In the interim, however, poaching increased even more and  countries with ivory were encouraged to sell it off while they still could.  Kenya chose instead to make a statement, hauling out its entire stockpile  of  tusks — about 12  to 13  tons, worth $3 million — and torching  it  in a  media-baiting bonfire. Meanwhile, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe argued  that  their elephant populations were plentiful enough to hunt  from and  an  important  natural  resource  for  their  economies,  which  they  should  not be penalized for making use of just because other countries misman- aged their own. In 1999 and again in 2008, these countries were permit- ted to sell their stockpiles, purportedly accrued from natural deaths and   confiscations from poachers.

Also, now that the global market has come to expect that  there will  periodically  be  sell-off  opportunities  in  exception  to CITES,  ivory can just be hoarded until the next one is announced. Today, upwards of 25,000 elephants are poached every year, and even  countries such as Kenya, which has been politically out front in promoting  conservation  and  anti-poaching  efforts,  are  experiencing  steep drops  in  their elephant populations. Ivory of any provenance is now mostly taboo  in Western society, thanks to the hard work of advocates who have been  lobbying on elephants’ behalf for decades. But it is hard to say what chance  this message has of getting through to China, by far the biggest market  for  the  material — a  country  whose  attitude  toward  human  life  leaves  much to be desired, not to mention animals. And at the source in Africa,  a region of the world that faces every possible kind of difficult reality, the  financial potential of a pair of tusks is a far more potent factor than global  opprobrium or sentiment for elephants. In the big picture, this is what it  looks like when an unstoppable force meets an all too moveable object.

The  conference of the parties did, however, vote to implement DNA testing in  tracing seizures of contraband ivory and other protected materials. Even as poaching  is  reducing  some  elephant populations  to perilous levels, others are being killed en masse supposedly for their own good.  Elephant feeding exacts a heavy burden from their habitat — fifty pounds  of vegetation munched by each elephant every day adds up to a lot. When  elephants  moved  freely  across  the  African  continent,  this  denuding  fit  naturally into regrowth patterns and the impact was dispersed. Confined  to parks, even very large ones, they can’t migrate in the same way and the  trees and ground cover get stripped down dramatically. Thus, to protect  biodiversity and avoid the sad spectacle of elephant starvation, many park  managers cull populations to what they deem sustainable levels. As Moss, Poole, and many others have eloquently argued, these grisly  interventions take a very short view of ecological cycles and elephant pop- ulations’ ability to self-regulate and adapt to their environment. Births go  down in the years following a major drought, for instance; since elephants’  reproduction cycles are so long, manually adjusting the population year  to year means intervening in a process that has not played itself out yet.

Soldiers and armies are expected to be aggressive.  “If  it  doesn’t look like what we think it should, we’ll make it so.” As in so many other ways, however, stepping in to control a specific  aspect  of  a  complex  situation  has  yielded  enormous  unintended  conse- quences. Although culling experts once believed that they could take out  precisely the desired number of elephant families while leaving the rest of  the population alone, more recent data show that survivors are definitely  affected,  even  if  they  were  far  away  at  the  time  of  the  cull.  Elephants  have relationships within their herds that extend well beyond the small  group of immediate family they travel and spend each day with, and their  long-distance communication capabilities make them aware of events hap- pening miles away. As Bradshaw and others have documented, disturbed  behavior has often been observed among these survivors, and autopsies of  those who die later for other reasons show signs of sustained high stress  consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. In  the past  several years,  there have been  increasing reports of  ele- phants rampaging around out of control — destroying property, attacking  people, raping and killing rhinos, and other chaotic behavior. Traditional  explanations for rogue elephants such as musth or competition for habitat  do not fit with the sudden change, as some behaviors (such as lethal fights  between bulls)  are  surging out of  proportion  to  their normal  incidence  and  some  (such  as  assaulting  rhinos)  are  otherwise  nearly  unheard  of.  Instead, Bradshaw points to the collapse of elephant society brought on  by culling and poaching, the licit and illicit forms of mass annihilation. In  addition  to  the  psychological  trauma  these  engender  in  survivors,  they  have also disrupted the transmission of elephant culture from one genera- tion to the next. Though elephants may naturally live to seventy, it is now rare to find  a male  over  forty  anywhere  in Africa,  and  even  those  are  rare  enough.  With  their  matriarchal  society,  it’s  easy  to  overlook  the  influence  of  the  seemingly  independent  bulls.  But Mother  Nature  needs  her  father  58 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

In ancient times the  spirit of life shone brightest in these; and when others that shared the  earth with them were taken by death they were left, being more worthy of  perpetuation. Like immortal flowers they have drifted down to us on the  ocean of time, and their strangeness and beauty bring to our imaginations  a dream and a picture of that unknown world, immeasurably far removed,  where man was not: and when they perish, something of gladness goes out  from nature, and the sunshine loses something of its brightness.  – W. H. Hudson, The Naturalist in La Plata The good news  for  elephants  is  that,  as  the most  charismatic  (and most  mega)  of  the  so-called  charismatic  megafauna,  they  have  many  friends.  Countless  organizations  exist  to  save  them  from  all  kinds  of  harms —  hunting, habitat loss, circuses, any number of other things that until even  very recently we’ve found acceptable. These groups and their messages have  not been ineffective, either, with the audiences that they reach. But even a  basic aim such as an animal this magnificent should not be slaughtered to make  carvings out of its teeth turns out to be dazzlingly hard to effect. It is one thing  to boycott ivory and even pass international laws against it; it is another to  confront the situation on the ground, entangled in a web of other issues. One particular story highlights many of them, recounted in a strange  and disturbing 2010 New Yorker essay by Jeffrey Goldberg. The bare facts  are these: in 1994, the dedicated conservationists Mark and Delia Owens  hosted  a  film  crew  from  ABC  to  document  their  anti-poaching  efforts  in Zambia.  In 1996,  the  show aired, preceded by a warning of violence  “which might be upsetting to viewers.” The warning was referring to a  scene that showed a suspected (but unarmed) poacher being shot to death  on camera. Under threat of legal action, the couple left the country imme- diately and have never been back. Neither Mark nor Delia was present on the scouting expedition where  the  shooting  took place,  and  in  fact,  not  all  of  the ABC crew members  were even aware that they had a “snuff film” on their hands, though they  noted bizarre occurrences around camp — a break-in supposedly attribut- ed to a hyena, the sudden dis- and re-appearance of a roll of film, a visitor  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 59 Copyright 2013.

Those who did know chose not to notify  authorities but just took the footage home and packaged it for broadcast. When the events of that day were ultimately televised and an investi- gation launched, if anything the details descended further into obscurity.  In the ABC program, the off-camera shooter is unidentified — and for that  matter, so is the victim. Mysteriously, no actual body was ever found, or  anyone reported missing within a large radius. A former U.S. ambassador  to Zambia (who was not in office at the time of these events) suggested  that ABC staged the whole shooting with actors and no one was actually  harmed. Mark’s version of the story also centered on the network’s eager- ness to get dramatic footage, insinuating that one of the local scouts was  bullied or excited by the camera crew into firing at someone recklessly. The  surprise  revelation  of  the  real  culprit  makes  for  a  troubling  dénouement — but in a way, the bigger story is not in the resolution (or  lack thereof) of this one terrible occurrence but in the milieu where it all  took place. To many Westerners, Africa is Eden or the Heart of Darkness, maybe  both. To Africans, Africa  is where  they  live. Many  see  the  tremendous  foreign interest in and power brought to bear on protecting their wildlife  as just the latest version of  imperialism. It  is all very well,  it seems, for  people whose  countries  have  never  dealt with  native  elephants  to  have  the  luxury  of  tooling  around  in  the  barren  strip  malls  that  support  a  comfortable lifestyle and counting on far-off places to hold the soul of the  natural world in trust, occasionally piped into our living rooms via nature  documentaries — but there are people living there as well, with their own  needs and aims and points of view. Elephants  have  long  been  a  nuisance  in  many  populated  areas,  marauding  through  crops  and  becoming  dangerous  when  challenged.  More  importantly, when  sources of  income are nearly nonexistent,  and  there is a voracious if illegal market for elephant products, the incentives  to ignore the law are far stronger than most local governments’ power or  resolve to enforce it. Enter the Owenses, with the ability to drop in as if from on high and  devote  their  considerable  energies  and  resources  to  no  other  purpose  than the salvation of the elephants. The partnerships they tried to forge  with park authorities and the neighboring community only went so far;  over the years, their program became characterized by a kind of ad hoc  martial law — armed night patrols in planes and helicopters, an unofficial  understanding with the scouts (whose training and support the Owenses  provided) that they should shoot to kill. 60 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

No one wanted it that way, and no one ever dreamed that it would come  to  that when  they were  starting  out,  but  carried  deep  into  a  desperate  situation, with other avenues exhausted and the massacre unchecked, it all  came down to that stark choice.

But give me  another solution. It’s why we still have elephants here.” But with  their  neocolonial  innuendo  and  condescending  racial  tone  (exiled  in  Idaho,  the  Owenses  reportedly  became  frustrated  that  they  couldn’t just order the neighbors around anymore) as well as an unseemly  eagerness for population control (going so far as to warn that “despite the  ravages of AIDS” there are still way too many Africans), the antihuman- ist  subtext  to  the  Owenses’  conservation  effort  becomes  clear.  “[Mark  Owens] scared my people,” a local chief told Goldberg. “The man has an  illness. He loves animals more than he loves people.” In  fact,  though the relative value of elephants  (alive or dead)  is  just  the question, the whole dark vortex is altogether human; actual animals  almost do not appear  in the New Yorker account at all, not even during  the raid on the supposed poacher, who was not only unarmed but does not  seem to have had an elephant to hunt. In fact, the star appearance of real  elephants in the essay is in a flashback to the Owenses’ arrival at the valley  in 1986, when they noticed the animals’ skittishness in approaching water,  a prime location for poachers to  lie  in ambush. “At this moment,” Mark  declared, “we pledge to each other: no matter what it takes, or how long,  we will stay in North Luangwa until the elephants come to drink at the  river  in peace.” This evidence of human violence was a  jarring contrast  to the unpopulated paradise they had become accustomed to in their first  twelve years in Africa, alone among the animals and the beating pulse of  raw nature and the expanse of open sky, as if they were, Mark wrote, “the  only two people in the universe.” Thus the romance of a world without us became a tragedy that’s all  about us. The complexities of life on earth with other people are just as  much a part of conservation in the bush as they are of mucking around in  society; and even the most righteous purpose in the world may come at a  damning cost. Elephantasies The torn boughs trailing o’er the tusks aslant, The saplings reeling in the path he trod, Declare his might, — our lord the Elephant, Chief of the ways of God.  – Rudyard Kipling, Beast and Man in India If  the elephants’ dire predicament  invariably warps  into a drama about  other fallen souls, they are at least recast into a more assertive role than  62 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013.

Donne, Agee, Kipling, and many others share a sense that elephants  inhabit a kind of special state of grace, and so they serve as inspiration for  thinking on the deepest things. Elephants figure in some way in a number of religions, more centrally  in areas of the world where they are native. The elephant  is considered  a totem (sacred ancestor) in many African cultures. The Koran contains  a Chapter of the Elephant, concerning how even the mightiest elephant- laced army was  felled by a  flock of birds and the will of Allah. Various  Christian  writings  take  the  elephant’s  graceful  and  majestic  nature  as  symbolic of the virtues or a testament to divine glory. One of the Sanskrit  Jataka Tales tells of the Buddha’s previous life as an elephant king, and  Buddhists  believe  that  white  elephants  are  bodhisattvas  (enlightened  beings),  or  at  least  their mounts. Ganesh,  the  elephant-headed Lord  of  Beginnings  and Obstacles,  is  among  the most  celebrated  deities  in  the  teeming Hindu universe. According to legend, Ganesh is the son of Shiva  the Destroyer and his consort Parvati, who one day appointed her son to  stand guard outside the door while she bathed. Due to a misunderstand- ing  at  the  threshold,  Shiva  sliced  off  his  own  son’s  head,  and  in  order  to  appease  the horrified Parvati,  replaced  it with  the head of  a  passing  A statue of Ganesh, the Hindu deity with the head of an elephant.

A sweeter variant has it that the famously amorous Shiva and  Parvati, observing a tender elephant couple in the forest and wishing to  partake in this new mystery of love, turned themselves into elephants for  a night, and from this union Ganesh was born. All religions metaphorically come together in the old fable of the blind  men and  the  elephant, where  each  feels  just one part of  it  and believes  he has the superior perception of the whole. Edward Topsell, who in his  1607 bestiary proclaimed that “there is no creature among all the Beasts  of the world which hath so great and ample demonstration of the power  and wisedom of almighty God as the Elephant,” reported that elephants  worship the sun and moon — a suggestion Lyall Watson also flirts with in  Elephantoms, but that probably belongs in the same category as Topsell’s  other fun fact that elephants conceive by eating mandrake. However, given  their mental  and emotional  chops and awareness of  mortality especially, who is to say that they don’t have some sense of the  metaphysical? The  central  facts  and mysteries of  their  existence,  about  which  they  clearly  have  deep  feelings,  are  the  same  as  ours:  death  and  love,  life  and  new  life,  the  chasm  between  the way  things  ought  to  be  and  how  they  really  are.  Alas,  we  can’t  begin  to  know what  elephants  make of such matters, but there is something weird and refreshing about  considering these basic existential questions from an intelligent animal’s  imagined point of view. No revelation, no tradition. Just attention to the  way the world goes by and simple wonder at it, with all of the same ques- tions that force themselves on us raw and fresh and perpetually unsolved  in moments of crisis or clarity. An elephant may only have dim  intima- tions of them, but after all, so do we; envisioning a more limited but still  searching perspective can renew our appreciation that we too see through  a glass darkly. Dale Estey’s  gentle  1989  novella The Elephant Talks to God  takes  a  whimsical  jab  at  such  a  thought  experiment.  Immanent  in nature, God  appears as a cloud or rock to converse with the inquisitive elephant. The  elephant wants  to know: How  is  it  that nature, which  is  so giving,  can  also be so rude? What does it mean to be an elephant, and not an ant, for  instance,  or  a  tree?  Is  there one  truth  about  the world, which presents  itself  to all of  them so differently,  and how would someone  find  it out?  Why is there fear, and what’s the deal with love? What happens in death?  Why is there such a thing as “if ” — that is, choices and possibilities? How  tragic is it that a butterfly, so beautiful, lives only through the summer? “Butterflies don’t live a season,” answers God. “They live a life.” The  elephant protests. “They’re gone when it’s their time,” replies the cloud.  64 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="56"> Do Elephants Have Souls? “To a butterfly the season is their life, they expect nothing more and fulfill  their existence. To the trees, your life  is brief. . . . Seconds or hours,  long  shadows or short, it’s all the same kind of time. The butterfly feels he has  as long a life as you.” Then pondering how such limits could be more gift  than theft, “God spoke to the elephant, and called him by his name, and  filled his heart full of his beloved butterflies, and they soared through his  blood, wingtip to wingtip, until he understood the power of their life.” Barbara Gowdy carries the exercise into a whole new dimension with  her brilliant 1998 novel The White Bone — which,  though  fictional,  is  as  impressively  conceptualized  an  answer  as  anybody has produced  to  the  question, What is it like to be an elephant? Based on meticulous research  into elephant behavior and other forms of savanna life, Gowdy lays out the  terrain of perceptions, circumstances, and relationships that inform what  an elephant might understand to be the meaning of existence. From that,  she constructs a fanciful but compelling edifice of myths and mores in an  elephant-centric cosmos. The subtext to this feat is a sly commentary on  the origin and purpose of human tradition and belief, beginning with the  following: in this world, the divine is known simply as the “She.” It is obvi- ous to the matriarchal society of “she-ones,” the name for both sexes of  her highest creatures, that this is so, and that everything that happens is in  some way ordained or at least foreseen by her, inscrutable as she may be. Calves  are  named  for  some  feature  of  the  circumstances  of  their  birth — Bolt during a storm, Swamp beside a bog — and the bulls retain  these names for their whole lives. Cows, however, having come of age, are  renamed for some attribute of the She (as all attributes are): She-Measures,  She-Brags, She-Sees. The bulls are not “changed” by their amorous rendez- vous, whereas the cows profoundly are, ultimately yielding new life, and  must mark the passage. Being  thus  privileged,  burdened,  and  empowered  in  a  way  others  are not,  grown  cows  are  the only ones  to  join  the She  in  the  sky  after  death — but only if they still have their tusks a full day after they die; a star  is the shine of a sky cow’s tusk. Sometimes these stars are felled, presum- ably by a “hindlegger” who in death as well as life covets the ivory, and  has snuck out to get it from his own place of eternal perdition underneath  the earth. Hindleggers  descended  from  the  she-ones  long  ago, when  during  a  famine a few she-ones broke the sacred law against eating another crea- ture, and were thereafter deprived of grace and cursed to walk upright in  rage and envy ever since. They seem to want the tusks so desperately in  order to recover some of their lost power (perhaps by grinding them up  Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 65 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. </page> <page sequence="57"> Caitrin Nicol to eat them). They are often accompanied by “sliders,” a kind of being that  is  peaceable  by  default, mainly  preferring  to  sleep,  unless  a  hindlegger  burrows inside one, which so disturbs it that it races around emitting foul  smells and noises. Some say that in recent years a new strain of hindleg- gers has appeared, ones which are remarkably non-aggressive and appear  to simply want to sit and watch. This seems implausible, but if it is true it  may be that they are remembering the time when they were she-ones, and  perhaps hoping that if they concentrate hard enough they will be returned  to that more favored form. As the story begins, a mass slaughter has nearly wiped out a whole  family of she-ones; and as members of a different family learn the news  and try to care for the survivors, a renewed attack occurs. In the ensuing  mayhem, a young cow is stranded from the rest, and so when they have  mourned their many dead, they must set off to find her. Meanwhile, there  is a rumor swirling around of a Safe Place protected from such atrocities  and  from  the  drought  that  is  overtaking  them  as well.  Somewhere  out  there is a talisman that would show the way, if they could only find it; but  they must be careful  in  their search to refer  to  it only as  “the  that-way  bone” or “the white prize,”  for  its power  is drained away whenever  it  is  spoken of directly as the white bone. Being independent, bulls come and go from the proceedings, but they  are still  intensely sentimental and  involved  in the she-one society, help- ing to spread gossip between the dispersed families, which they may be  variously connected to by birth or by fond memories of mating. One bull  in particular, Tall Time, is especially interested in the plight of the sepa- rated family and the possibility of the white bone. He is a master of signs,  omens,  and  superstitions — the  “links”  in  the known world  that  explain  why things happen the way they do. It stands to reason that by master- ing every piece of this lore, he can gain control over — or at least find his  bearings in — what may seem like hard chance. His  investigative spirit  is shared by Date Bed,  the missing cow calf.  She is a budding scientist for whom “thus spake the She” is not an accept- able explanation for anything — but her inquiry into whys and hows has  not led her to suspect that there might be no basis for any of the mythol- ogy; rather, she sees it as a breach of faith to not believe that the She would  want to make her secrets knowable. Whereas Tall Time becomes crash- ingly disillusioned when confronted by too many tragedies and too many  unknowns, Date Bed’s trust in ultimate order and benevolence keeps her  from losing heart while lost on the savanna. She is no more than dimly  aware that she owes the credit  to herself,  to her own insight, pluck, and  66 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

The third major character is Mud, who is less philosophically curious  than Date Bed and Tall Time, but her life began under terrible circum- stances, and since then she’s had both the alienated perspective of an out- sider and an unshakeable inner recognition of the dark side of reality. There is a diffuse, tragic, exhilarant eroticism in their nearly hopeless  tripartite search, for each other, for a white bone and a Safe Place which  may or may not exist, for whatever meaning or direction underlies it all.  These  yearnings  are  cast  against  the  ordinary  conditions  of  hardship  aggravated by systemic assault on their kind like hot winds howling over  baked terrain. Their various approaches to their situation — we can know  it, we can fix it, we can escape it — yield innovative strategies and raise the  emotional stakes for success but have little purchase on their fundamental  circumstances, just as, in the human sphere, science and technology may  better our lives immensely in the short term while ultimately they change  nothing.  At  bottom,  “thus  spake  the  She”  turns  out  to  be  the  cardinal  explanation after all. But  if  anything does  change,  it  is Mud’s  awakening  to  her  place  in  the society she always felt was bogus — which, true, was not dreamed up  in perfection de novo but came to be collaboratively conceived and passed  down over time, by other elephants who found in it a way to protect each  other  both  from  danger  and  from  despair.  Though  the  essence  of  the  she-ones is memory, the force of life flows forward; and by devotion, fear,  necessity, or whatever it takes, that is the direction they must go. If there  is a meaning to the whole ordeal, it is that they love each other. For one  sure thing about the elephants is that they are deeply capable of love. The Pale Blue Dot I had seen a herd of Elephant travelling through dense Native forest,  where the sunlight is strewn down between the thick creepers in small  spots and patches, pacing along as if they had an appointment at the  end of the world.  – Isak Dinesen, Out of Africa The outlook for elephants today is grim. Naturally, as one would hope, the  common refrain of all the literature about them is a rousing alarm on behalf  of these friends, totems, property, and sometime foes with whom we share  an  earth, who  even with  their  great  strength have  patiently  endured  all  kinds of violations from us and now depend on our goodwill to save them. Winter/Spring 2013 ~ 67 Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.

All  the other  land giants have already met  their  appointments  at  the  end of  the world. The  elephants will  not have  the  space to just be who they are forever. For Lyall Watson,  a march  to  the  edge  of  the world  by  one  park’s  sole surviving elephant prefigures this eventuality. Wandering along the  cape one day, Watson witnessed a remarkable meeting worth recounting  at length: It  is  a  sound  that  sneaks up on you,  something you  feel  rather  than  hear,  a  rumble  which  is more  visceral  than  cerebral,  threatening  to  addle  your  mind. . . . I  knew  that  blue  whales  can  make  high-energy,  low-frequency moans  that  last  for  thirty  seconds or more, but  I had  never heard one before when watching blue whales off Baja California  or  Peru.  I  supposed  that  the  sound  of  ship  engines  and  generators  might have masked it, but I hadn’t imagined that the calls would fall  within our range of hearing anyway. . . . The  sensation  I  was  feeling  on  the  clifftop  was  some  sort  of  reverberation  in the air  itself. Perhaps an  interference pattern set up  68 ~ The New Atlantis Copyright 2013. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information. iStockphoto </page> <page sequence="60"> Do Elephants Have Souls? between the whale call and  its echo  from the rocks below? That  too  seemed unlikely, and I was still puzzling over it when I realized that the  whale had submerged and I was still feeling something. The strange  rhythm seemed now to be coming from behind me, from the land, so  I turned to look across the gorge, sweeping my gaze across the cliffs,  over the great milkwood tree — and then swiftly back to the tree again,  where my heart stopped. . . . Standing  there  in  the  shade  of  the  tree was  an  elephant.  A  fully  grown  African  elephant,  facing  left,  staring  out  to  sea! . . .A  female  with a left tusk broken off near the base, looking for all the world like  the stub of a  large cigar. I had never seen this elephant before, but I  knew who she was, who she had to be. I recognized her from a color  photograph put out by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  under the title “The Last Remaining Knysna Elephant.” This was the  Matriarch herself. But what was she doing here? . . . She was here because  she no  longer had anyone  to  talk  to  in  the  forest. She was standing here on the edge of the ocean because it was  the next, nearest, and most powerful source of infrasound. The under- rumble of the surf would have been well within her range, a soothing  balm for an animal used to being surrounded, submerged, by low and  comforting frequencies, by the lifesounds of a herd, and now this was  the next-best thing! My heart went out to her. The whole idea of this grandmother of  many being  alone  for  the  first  time  in her  life was  tragic,  conjuring  up  the  vision  of  countless  other  old  and  lonely  souls.  But  just  as  I  was about  to be consumed by helpless sorrow, something even more  extraordinary took place. . . . The  throbbing was back  in  the air.  I  could  feel  it,  and I began to  understand  why.  The  blue  whale  was  on  the  surface  again,  pointed  inshore, resting, her blowhole clearly visible. The Matriarch was here  for  the  whale!  The  largest  animal  in  the  ocean  and  the  largest  liv- ing land animal were no more than a hundred yards apart, and I was  convinced  that  they were  communicating!  In  infrasound,  in  concert,  sharing  big  brains  and  long  lives,  understanding  the  pain  of  high  investment in a few precious offspring, aware of the importance and the  pleasure of complex sociality, these rare and lovely great  ladies were  commiserating over the back fence of this rocky Cape shore, woman to  woman, matriarch to matriarch, almost the last of their kind. I turned, blinking away the tears, and left them to it. This was no  place for a mere man. . . .

Out of great loneliness,  the elephant went to the edge of her world and poured her soul into the  void — and out of great providence, someone was there to answer. From  some  combination  of  existential  loneliness  and  intrepid  curi- osity, we  also  have  for  decades  now  been  calling  out  for  someone  past  the borders  of  our known experience.
