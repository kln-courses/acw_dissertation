<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hittite Language of Boghaz Keui l?Y TiiK Kkv. I'ltOt'KSSOlt A. II. SAYCK A FTEIt a delay of many years certain of the cuneiform "^ texts discovered by the German excavating expedition to Boghaz Keui in 1907 have been published during the War (30 wissenschaftliche Ver?ffentlichung der Deut sehen Orient-Gesellschaft: Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazk?i, parts i and ii?the third part has not yet reached foreign scholars; Ilinrichs, Leipzig, 191G). It has therefore become possible to attack the problem of decipherment with a fair show of success, and also to estimate the value of such attempts at it as have already been made. Just before the War Professor Delitzsch published a number of lexical fragments, in which the Hittite words are given with their Assyrian and Sumerian equivalents, and it is from these that every scientific attempt at decipherment must start. The cuneiform originals which were transliterated by Professor Delitzsch are to be found in part i of the Keilschrifllejle. Meanwhile Professor llrozny, the Viennese Assyriologist, who had received advanced copies of the texts, has been at work upon their decipherment. In 1917 he published an elaborate grammar of them (Die Sprache der Hethiter, Ilinrichs, Leipzig, in the Boghazk?i Studien edited by Otto Weber), and in 1919 he has followed this up by translations of the more important inscriptions (Hethitische Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazk?i in Umschrift, mit IJ eher Setzung vnd Kommentar, part i ; Ilinrichs, Leipzig). In his translation and grammar Hrozny has shown great acumen and a genius for discerning the general signification of a passage even where his philo logical analysis of it must be corrected ; his most important discovery, however, is that of the pronominal forms which he has succeeded in detecting and explaining. JUAS. .IAN. 1920. 1</page><page sequence="2">T)0 IIITTITK LANGUAGE OF UOGIIAZ KKUI Unfortunately he started with a theory which his first volume was intended to support?that the Hittite language was Indo-European, or worse still, " Indo-Gcrmanic." it is the old story of Corssen or Savelsberg over again, with their endeavours to turn Etruscan and Lycian into Indo European languages. It would seem that the historical texts in his second volume, which are the most helpful for the purposes of decipherment, were not altogether at his disposal when the first volume was written, and there are signs that he is now no longer so sure as he was of the purely Indo European character of Hittite. " Caucasian " influences are admitted, and the indubitably Indo-European element in the Boghaz Keui texts is referred to a " Kharrian " and not a Hittite source. In the case of an unknown language the first requisite of scientific decipherment is the absence of philological theory. When we have satisfactorily deciphered the language we can compare it with other languages and determine its philological connexions, but the decipherment must come first. And Indo-European languages are easy to recognize?at all events for the comparative philologist : as soon as the Persian transcripts of the Persian cuneiform inscriptions were deciphered there was no dispute about their Iranian character. As far back as 1907, in my article on the " Cuneiform Tablet from Yuzgat", I had already sketched the outlines of the nominal declension and verbal conjugation in Hittite and identified the chief personal and demonstrative pronouns. But my materials were scanty, consisting only of the mutilated " Yuzgat " tablet and the two Arzawan letters, and my sketch of the grammar can now be enlarged and corrected. It is, however, upon the grammatical forms already indicated by me that Professor Hrozny's Indo-European theory is mainly built. Has the larger mass of material which he has interpreted made it necessary to revise my conclusion that 11 it lite was a mixed language, and that the coincidences</page><page sequence="3">IIITTITK LANGU AGI! OK ltO&lt;OIAZ KKIJI 5 I between Hittite and Indo-European grammar prove nothing more than geographical contact and mutual influence ? He tells us that such is the case. New facts, discovered by himself, which are as " solid as a rock ", prove convincingly the Indo-European character of the language. First among these are the existence of the word w?dar " water " with its genitive wedenas, participles in -nt, kuis " who " and huid " what ", ug " ego ", and ammitg efioi-yf, ziy " thou " by the side of tug, iya-mi " I make ", iya-si " thou makest ;\ iya-(n)zi " he makes", iya-iveni " we make", iya-lcni "ye make ", iya-(n)zi " they make ". There is no such word, however, as icddar. It is written wa-a-tar and is formed with the same suffix -tar which, as the vocabularies show, denoted abstracts, and had certainly nothing to do with the ~8ayp of v?c?p, where the d belongs to the root. Nor can it be identified with the Indo-European nop, Ttjf)t which did not denote abstracts. There is another word walar found in wa-tar-na-akh-kha-an-za, which the vocabularies translate muera " leader " ; this may possibly be related to ullar which Hrozny has shown to mean " word ,?, so that ivatar-nahhkhanza would be literally " word-issuer'V Hrozny is also possibly right in thinking that u-i-da-a ar in the Yuzgat tablet is another form of the same word. If so, the variation in spelling indicates that it is a borrowed foreign word. That wa-a-tar really does signify " water " is made clear by a passage in a ritual text. As for vetenas, uclenit, I agree with Hrozny in believing that in a passage cited by him uetenit is intended to be a translation of the Assyrian me-c " waters ", and that the first syllable was pronounced like the English " wet " ; but in this case v&amp;cop must be given up, since the vScop and watan stems belong to two different divisions of the Indo-European family. It is possible, how ever, that uetenit, etc., have nothing to do with " water ", 1 Xa-nwar is "to sond '", nakhkhvmar "to uunsc to send". The connexion of watar with at tar, however, is very dnuhtful, since the root of nt tar is ut or ud, which is really of Indo-Kuropeati origin (Ski. rad. ?Jk. vatio). Watar, consequently, may he an ?idverl?.</page><page sequence="4">52 HITTITE LANUIUIJK OF 1UHJIIA7. KEl?l since a word uetin is used in the ritual texts, which is doubtfully translated "old" by Hrozny, who is haunted by recollections of the Latin velus. The latter word really means " income " or " endowment ".' Wdtar is accompanied by two verbs which are also regarded as supports for the Indo-European theory. We find the phrase : nu NINDA-an cizza-lleni tcdtar-ma ekn-tteni, "so food you eat and water you drink." (N1N?A is not merely 4 bread " as Hrozny translates, but " food " generally ; it includes offerings of flesh as well as meal-offerings, see, e.g. K.B. iij 1, Obv. i, 41.) Eizza is, of course, assumed to represent the Indo-European stem cd- " to eat ", which is hardly possible ;- while in cku- the Latin aqua is discovered. Unfortunately the root of aqua has not produced a verb signifying " to drink " in any known Indo-European language. Moreover Professor Hrozny finds both eizza and chi- dis porting themselves under a Harlequincsque variety of forms ; according to him eizza- also appears as azzik- and ada-, and eku- as aku- and akku(s)-. This alone makes us suspicious of his theories. But in the case of both azzik- and akku(s)- it can be shown that they rest on an erroneous translation. We read in an unpublished text : nukissan memai SE-KHAL kitla nebisas AN UD-its azziki tas atlas AN-MES azzikandu TE-IM AN-MES azzikkandu, " So say as follows : 0 Sun-god (of heaven?)/1 towards the grain utter incantations!

" I take this signification from Hrozny.</page><page sequence="5">IIITTITK LANGI AGI; OK IIOGIIAZ KKL'I 5') the incantatory word ! " In the line immediately preceding we have : nu GU-A-GIG GU-SAG zikkanzi, "so he incantates the . . . and heart," where zik must be the zik " word "or " speech " frequently met with in the texts and erroneously identified with the second personal pronoun by Professor Hrozny. The Professor, however, has himself shown that this pronoun was lug, and even Hittite is not likely to have used two such variant forms as tug and ziy in the same text and in the same grammatical sense. Ziy or zik, in fact, is employed with the 3rd pers. of the verb, as well as in such sentences as zigga lie istamasli, "and the command thou didst not obey." Besides azzikkandu we read in an unpublished text : kuis gan AN-MI kt -. AN SIN KI-LlB-oE iyat nu apt s AN-AII KAK-zis-kiddu akkus-kiddu, " whenever the Moon-god makes the omen l of an eclipse on a festival, then let them diann the eclipse and interpret (the omen)." In a corresponding passage khingan takes the place of the ideograph *- ?, which is also written ^ ???." It will be noticed that in KAK-zis-kiddu zik has become zis for zikis. while KAK " make " is the equivalent of the initial az. It would seem, therefore, that the Hittite scribe saw in az-zik a com pound, the first element of which signified " to make" and the second " words ". As for akkus kiddu the passages in which the compound verb occurs suggest that it signified " to interpret (the will of the gods) ". Hence in Yuzgat, Obv. 17-19 we read : Khakkhimas altissi annissi teizzi . . . kt azzi-kkitani akkus-kitlani . . . kabbuiva addin, "Khakhkhimas says to his father (and) his mother : In accordance with the incantation and divination I have given the [whole| number 1 Kl-LIB-HE -- Siimcriaii gara.s "omen".

From the root of the verb akkuwar we have akkandus, which Professor Hrozny would translate " the manes of the dead.", but wrhich literally signifies " diviners'".1 Akkandus is an example of what Hrozny calls a cc participle in -nt ", -nt and -nd constantly interchanging in the form in question. But the form cannot be separated from the nouns in -a(n)da, also written -(a)nta, which, occur so frequently as local names, more especially of mountains. Thus we find the mountain Arinnanda by the side of the city Arinna, or the city-name Buranda by the side of Burns. It is obvious that there can be no question of a " participle " here. Nouns denoting parts of the body further assumed the suffix ; thus by the side of khala-nta " head " given in the Vocabularies we have khalas-mis " my head " in the Yuzgat tablet, and in an unpublished text ziyanda-z (NINDA-GIS-RA-i/a zi-ya an-da-z) interchanges with ina pani " in the face of ",2 -(A)nda also formed adverbs, though here it perhaps represented the nominal suffix -ta with nasalization, which is used in an instrumental sense (e.g. nas-ta, kuttani-t). An instructive example of the true character of the suffix is offered by the name of a god, which in the same inscription and within fourteen lines one of the other is written Innarao wantes and Innaraowandas. Innatas is the name of a man, and a man's name is not capable of generating a " participle ", even when he develops into a god. Both -te and -da or -ta are found without the preceding nasalization (e.g. ziggates), 1 I have assumed in the above that Professor Hrozny is right in translating eku "to drink". But there are serious difficulties in the way. In an unpublished text ekuzzi interchanges with akuwanzi, which would, therefore, have the same meaning. But neither eku nor aku is given in the Vocabularies as the words signifying "to drink". These are sel?war and isparri-ya-uwar, the latter of which is construed with clag?n, on which see above, in an unpublished text?nu (GIS) la-akh khar-nu-uz-zi da-ga-a-an is-pa-ra-an-zi, "he drinks the water through a spout(?)." Lakhkharnu is a compound of lakhk.hu "to pour out", and arnu as in kutassan arnuwar, which, according to the Vocabularies, signified " to put a question ". 2 The simple ziyan "face" is found in the inscriptions.</page><page sequence="7">IIITTITIi LANGUAGE OK liOQIIAZ KKII 55 and my own belief is that they are really suffixed verbs like the ki in azzi-ki, akkus-kiltani. However this may be, the only adjectives 1 can discover approaching participles in sense terminate in -nna and -tta, as, for instance, a sauna s " seated ", and khandattas " standing ", applied to statues of sedi or guardian spirits (K.B. ii, 38, 9, 10). In the verbal form in -is, like pais " giving ", I have hitherto seen a present participle ; Professor Hrozny regards it as the 3rd pers. of a tense. I now think we are both right and both wrong ; pais is neither a present participle nor a 3rd pers. in the Indo-European sense, but corresponds with an English " is giving " or, to a certain extent, with an ablative absolute in Latin. Its use is like that of the verbal form in -li in Vannic. Kuis " who " and kuid " what " are temptingly like the Latin quis and quid, and when we further find kuis-ki and kuid-ki "whoever", "whatever", we are inclined to say that their Indo-European origin can admit of no (juestion. But (1) the newly discovered bilingual Lydian inscription shows that in Lydian also kudkid and kitkid meant " what ever ", and (2) the employment of kuis and kuid or the accusative kuin in the texts is absolutely irreconcilable, either with Indo-European syntax or with regarding them as pronouns in an Indo-European sense. They precede instead of following the words to which they refer, they head a sentence to which there is no antecedent, and they are employed as adverbs of place and time. Thus kuin, which is generally used with an accusative singular, appears in H.B.K. p. 188, as both singular and plural : nu-za AN Samsi kuin NAM-RA ina bit sarri uwatenun, " thereupon to the Sun-god which spoil into the palace I brought " ; ALII Khatta-as-ma-za EN-MES ZAB-MES ANSU-KUR-RA-MES -ya kuin NAM-RA-MES uwateit, " then of the city of Khattu the infantry and cavalry officers which spoils brought." Or, again, nu-za KHAR-SAG Askharpaian kuis ALU Gasgas esan kharta nu sa MAT ALU Paid KHARRAN-MES karassan</page><page sequence="8">5(5 HITTITE LANGUAGE OF HOGHAZ KKUI kliarla means " the city of Kaskas which had taken Mount Askharpaias as a station blocked the roads of Palu " ; while namma kuis-a SARll-us kisari nu AKYl\]-as SAL-KU-as idtilusanakh-zi (literally, " then who and a king shall be ") is " then if there shall be a king who shall injure brothers (and) sisters ". What could an Indo-European scholar make of such sentences as : nu SARltU MAT ALU Kargamis hi it Dudkhaliyas Khalpakhiss-a ntakhar AN Satnsi dieser, "so the king of Karchemish what Dudkhaliyas and Khalpakhis did not appear before the Sun-god " ; hits kuit arkuuar igazi AN Samsi islamas-mi, " who what petitioning he makes I the Sun-god heard " ; SAL-MES knit GIU-MES-rr? Mian khalier, "the women what embraced the feet" ? The only way in which such pronominal forms can be understood is to fall back on the explanation I gave of them in my paper on the Yuzgat tablet. They were originally forms of the verb ku " to be ", and never altogether lost their original significa tion. Hence, in the sentences quoted above, kuit is literally " it is that ". i.e. " namely " ; " who makes it-is-petitioniiig " ; ""the women it was". That my explanation was correct is now shown by our finding the future of the verb?kueri " it will be "?in the published texts.1 As a matter of fact, instead of supporting the Indo-European hypothesis, the syntactical use of kuis, kuit is for the scientific linguist the strongest argument against it. As for the suffixed hi, it has nothing to do with the Latin quid, but is borrowed from Assyrian, as is proved not only by its length?it is written ki-i and ki-e?but also by its use in all the senses of the Assyrian ki " as ", " when ", " that ", " like ", " according to ", " thus ". A common phrase in the Annals, for instance, is nu ina MU I KAM k? iyanun, "so in one year thus have I done," corresponding with the similar phrase in the Vannic inscriptions : istin? inanili arniusinili 1 8o in Hrozny, IT. K.M., p. 212, I. SI : munna-wa-mn zakhkhiya utvtmi iinu-atta ul knwufqa atnmel A-SAG fcttcri, "and if you come to battle with me no portion of my land shall be yours.*'</page><page sequence="9">IMTTITK LANGUAGE OF ItOGIIAZ KrX'l 57 MU zaduhi, "thus have I made this spoil (in) one year." llg is not ego. In the first place, the vowel is long, the word being written u-ug. Secondly, the final g is the suffix which we find attached to the pronouns ammu-g " mine ", tu-y " thine ", as Professor Hrozny was the first to point out. His discovery of the various forms of the personal pronouns is, indeed, the most brilliant part of his work, and his determination of the true nature of the forms in -(e)/, ammel, tuel, etc., has thrown a flood of light on the Hittite language. Hut in identifying ug with ego the unfortunate mirage of his Indo-European theory led him astray. It is a, not ny, which represents the 1st personal pronoun ; the form with final -(e)l is found in u-ell-u which we have in the Yuzgat tablet (Obv. 10) : KHAR-SAG-MES-as u-i-da-a-ar GIS-SAR-ZUN u-e-el-lu nu lu-el . . . " the mountains, waters (?), forests which are mine [I give] to thee." The final -u denotes I he plural as elsewhere, e.g. nus " them ". eseru " they shall be ". In H.K.B. p. 110 we find u-g-a agglutinated with teams " them " : abe-wa-mu idalu-ier u-y-a-warus idalu-[iyami], " and should they do evil to me, I also to them (will do] evil." Ammu-g, also written ammu-qq(a), more usually takes the place of tl-g ; thus Hrozny quotes a passage : ammu-g ana AN Istar bilti-ya ajxit addin, " I gave them to Istar my lady." Consequently it cannot be equated with the dative e?oi-ye. I have already dealt with zik or zig, which really signifies " a word ". The verbal forms are more serious. In my Yuzgat paper I had already pointed out that the 1st pers. sing, was expressed by -mi and -i and the 3rd pers. by -t ; my materials did not provide the suffixes of the 2nd pers. sing, (-si), 1st pers. plur. (-ueni), 2nd pers. plur. (-teni), and 3rd pers. plur. (-er), which have been discovered by Professor Hrozny. I did not recognize the 1st pers. sing, in -un and -nun, and misinterpreted the suffixes of the 3rd pers. sing., -nzi and -izii, the first of which I erroneously made a 2nd pers. sing, and</page><page sequence="10">f&gt;S IIITTITK LANGUAGE OF HOG HAZ KKUI the second the case of a noun. But I naturally recognized the agreement between the Hittite and Indo European forms ; no one, indeed, could fail to do so. At the same time I also recognized that the forms are not peculiar to Indo-European. In Vannic, too, the 1st pers. is denoted by -bi (or -toi) and the 3rd pers. plural by -tu, while the 3rd pers. sing, is expressed by the suffix -ni. In Sumerian the 1st pers. sing, is mu, ma, and m? (or mi), the 2nd zu, zae, and si, the 3rd ni, na, in, while the 1st pers. plur. is men, the 2nd zinc or zien, and the 3rd n? and ene. Moreover, the suffixes of the Hittite verb are not always distinguished from one another in sense as they wrould be in Indo-European. Thus -ta and -ti represent both the 2nd and the 3rd pers. sing., while -ta is also found with a plural subject, -i denotes the 1st and 3rd pers. sing, indillercntly as well as the 2nd pers, sing, of the imperative, -t appears as the suffix of the 1st pers. sing, iu eskhat, " I seated myself upon.'' and -(n)zi means "they" as well as "he" (Keilschriftlexte, ii, p. 48, 1. 10). The chief verbal sulfixes are attached also to nouns which can be used in the place of verbs. A noun with the suffix -(n)za, for example, which usually denotes a noun of agency, can take the place of a 3rd pers. sing, in (-n)zi. The use of the verbal suffixes, in short, approximates to that of the Caucasian rather than that of the lndo-Europeau languages. The most strikingly Indo-European feature in the Hittite verb is the 3rd pers. plur. in -er, while the 1st and 2nd pers. plur. might be claimed by advocates of the Semitic origin of the Hittites, if any such still exist. If we are to attain scientific results we must apply to Hittite the only legitimate method through which an unknown language can be deciphered, and proceed from the known to the unknown. In the case of Hittite we have fortunately a solid basis from which to start. The Vocabularies furnish us with the Assyrian and Sumerian translations of a large number of words, as well as of a few phrases. Next to them come the ideographs iu the texts themselves, which are</page><page sequence="11">HITTITE LANGUAGE OP ItOGIIAZ KEG I 50 accompanied by phonetic renderings or of which the phonetic renderings are found in parallel passages. As the signification of the ideographs is known, the signification of their phonetic renderings becomes known also. Determinatives tell us to what class a particular word belongs, whether it is personal or geographical, the name of a woman, of a vessel, an article of wood, and the like. With these various aids we can attack simple texts, more especially those of a historical character, and by a comparison of passages not only fix the meaning of individual word-*, but also the sense of the grammatical forms. What is not legitimate is to start with a theory of linguistic relationship aud use this as a key, so determining the meaning of words. And this is what Professor Hrozny has done, thereby marring his work of decipherment, which is solid and brilliant as long as he keeps clear of this " Indo Germanic " theory. It does not seem to have struck him how comparatively few of the words, the signification of which has been ascertained by legitimate means, lend themselves to it, and what desperate efforts are needed in order to discover an Indo-European origin for them. Thus te *; to speak " is identified with the Indo-European dhe " to place ", though it might have been thought that the Mitannian li-wi kt a word " was a more obvious relation. But such com parisons, however absurd, are innocuous where the significa tion of a word has already been determined in a scientific manner. It is otherwise where the signification is obtained by resort to an Indo-European dictionary. Thus karu (which is found in the compound kart?-ariwar " morning ", literally " day-spring ") is referred to the Latin car and explained as an adverb with the signification of " early ". The word, however, interchanges with the Assyrian yumi " day " and means " to-day ", e.g. MAR-SU ma-wa-ssi-za-gan kuis ana GIS-GU-ZA ABI-SU esat nu-wa apdss-a kartl AA1EL KAL-anza esta, " but as regards his son also who occupies the throne of his father, now he too is to-day a powerful man " ; nu kar? MU X KAM khassuizna</page><page sequence="12">(?0 HITTITE LANGUAGE OF I100IIA/, KEUI nun, "so 10 years to-day I have been king."

There is, again, a wrord ntiui, also written naivi, of un certain meaning. With the Greek i'?oc before his eyes Professor Hrozny renders it " new ", and identifies it with a word which is written na-a-GESTIN in the ritual texts. He assumes that GESTIN " wine " was pronounced like the Latin vinum, and very ingeniously supposes that it was used phonetically with the value wt. Hut, in the first place, I he first syllable of the Indo-European word for "new" is short, and secondly, it so happens that we know the Hittite word for "wine". In K..B. ii, 7, Obv. 18, the name of the city called Oinoanda by the Greeks is written ALU GESTIN Yanuantas, showing that the word for " wine " was yanis (Heb. y'yin, Ass. inu). A7f/-GESTIN occurs in a phrase which comes at the end of a list of endowments given to different temples or chapels by the king; e.g. K.B. ii, 1, Rev. iii. fl : AN Samsi dais (ME-isf I bii-ilim vedin AMEL SANGU massi wr-GESTIN, "(all this) the Sun-god (i.e. the king) ordains as the endowment of one chapel ; (also) the investiture of a priest." Instead of the last sentence we sometimes find AMEL massis ivatkut " a priest is absent ", watku, as Hrozny has seen, being the simple form of the (causative) watku-nu-t " he expelled ", in the historical inscriptions. Massis, vntssiyas " a priest " is a common word in the ritual texts and is borrowed from the Assyrian nmssu, while the 1 The signification of knirnhi is fixed by such passages as nn-za-gan ana &lt;?IS GU-ZA A HI-Y A kmrahi vtkhat, "and then on (-lie throne of my father I scaled myself in succession.'' 2 In some of the ritual rexts MK hits ils theological moaning of ** prophesying ". Its equivalence with the Hill ite root da, which lias been already noted by Hrozny, shows that the lutter has nothing to do with the I.E. dd "In give", as he supposes, nor with dha "to place", as I once suggested. Accordingly, natgan khast? ddi is literally "and &lt;hi&gt; he ordains for the king%',dakhkhnn " I decreed", i.e. "assigned to".</page><page sequence="13">HITTITE LANGUAGE OF BOGHAZ KEU? 61 signification of n?yaninl (na-GESTIN) is approximately fixed by KB. ii, 2, Obv. i, 31-2 : kuit-man-z-as-gan khassueznanni wd-GESTIN esari,2 " at what time he also shall have election to the sovereignty." It may be added that the word pankus " of unknown signification ", which is mentioned by Hrozny in connexion with his " nawi-i&gt;?o? ", is explained in the Vocabularies by alkakadu " the courses " (of the priests) (K.B. i, 35, 11-12).

The character to be supplied is more probably AMEL than SARRU, so that the translation will be: "Of Arnuanda(s) the Khuoliyanis, the contents of the House of Stone Monuments." 2 Esari has nothing to do with the root ?.so " to sit", which is vouched for by the Vocabularies. ANA OIS OU-Z? ABI-SU emt. is "he occupied" (or perhaps, " mounted to) the throne of his father" ; nu-za KHAR-SAG Askharpaian kuis ALU Gasgas esan lchtirta, 4i then the city of the Kaskians which had taken mount Askharpaias in (literally, as) occupation." In the Vocabularies es-zi is translated [i]su "to have ", and "a day-labourer" is UT-KAM-ow aniyan kuis ?smi, "he who receives a day's reckoning." On the other hand, the root ex corresponds with our substantive verb in a phrase like ALU lyaruwatas ALU-as sa MAT ALU Barga esta, "Iyaruwattas is a city of Barga "; while AKHU-MES SU ?WEL-MES gaena-ssis AMEL-MES khassana-ssas ? ZAB-MES-SU taruppantes eser means "his brothers, his priests, his royal family, and his soldiers were assembling", and in the Vocabularies the Assyrian tukidtu is rendered by makhkhat esuwar " to stand behind ". Either two verbs, es and es, one signifying " to be" and the other " to have ", have been confused together, or verbal forms borrowed from Indo-European have been confounded with forms of native origin. Perhaps the key to the difficulty is to be found in the Arzawan letters, where ?stu is followed by an accusative : SEG-m es-tu "may they have prosperity ". Similarly in Greek ex? has acquired the sense of "to be". The city of Iyaruwattas, b}^ the way, appears to be the Yarimuta or Yariwuta of the Babylonian and Tel el-Amarna inscriptions, possibly Qarmatia in the geographical list of Thothmes III, and certainly Armuthia in classical geography, which Tomkins identifies with Khan Karam?ta on the descent from the Beilan Pass to the plain of Umk. 3 The ideograph MAR means " a gift". Minu must be the Assyrian m?nii. In K. B. ii, 2, Oho. \, 28, we have minumarra, which shows that the whole compound had been borrowed by the Hittite scribes. Hrozny refers it to the Latin minus !</page><page sequence="14">&lt;?- liriTlTK bANUUAtiE OF HOflHAZ KKUI KAM pankus-za Q\JB-la-tar khulluya ME-as " on the second ?lay assigning the stated (?) gifts of the gods, giving them to the Great Goddess, on the third day in the services they prophesy (or decree) evil on the left side " (K.B. ii, 6, Obv. ii, 1-2). It should be noticed that das is plural, dais singular. Another illustration of the false conceptions Professor Hrozny's Indo-European theory has introduced into his work is his explanation of the common verbal form in -/ci. As this is very frequently preceded by s, he will have it that we have here the Indo-European verbal formative -sk, in defiance of the Hittite scribes themselves, who carefully separate the k from the s, as in the word akkus-kittani quoted above. As a matter of fact the k follows not only s, but also n (as in khurnin-kun " I attacked ", " I conquered ") and a vowel (as in sip-anza-kir " they offered "), and it is evident that it is really a separate verb attached to the accusative singular and plural of a noun and coalescing with them into a com pound. Tales-kit stands on exactly the same footing as tales-du- (H.K.B., p. 142). As in Vannic, such verbal com pounds are plentiful in Hittite ; nu, which forms a causative, is one of them ; so, too, are the compound verbs in te, ti, or in y a, iya, and it is possible that the reflexive -khkh- was originally an agglutinated verb kha, khu. In ya, iya we plainly have the verb iya(uwar) " to make ", ki may be the verb which, according to Hrozny, neans " to lay ", or less probably hi " to be " ; te or li is a verb of common occurrence which signified " to approach ", " join ". The form in -s assumed by the first element of the compound occurs again in f's-ta " he has ", " he is ", baras-ta " he fled ", ]^is-tn " thou gavest" (H.K.B.,p. 180), the latter of which is parallel to the nominal memis-ta " thy speaker ". By the side of pais-ta we find pais-ti, and a prefixed nominative could even intervene between the two elements of the compound as in tuzziyas-viis khtfitl iyanun, "I made my army assemble." The applica tion of the categories of the Indo-European conjugation to the Hittite forms can lead only to a misconception of them,</page><page sequence="15">HITTITE LANGUAGE OF HOGIIAZ KEUI 03 and would fail to explain forms like the compound iyann iyanun (H.K.B., p. 180), samin-kis-ki (H K.B., p. 128), or even sakuwan-dares-kir " they neglected " (H.K.B., p. 108).' The Indo-European element -smas, which Professor Hrozny parades, is similarly a figment. Nusmas is merely nus + mas. Nus, the plural of the 3rd pers. nas, is of frequent occurrence ; so, too, is the particle mas, which is the " nominative " of the particle mdn. Both nus and mds, like? man, are used separately. Besides nuis we have mas and man, of which ma is a shortened form, as anda "towards" is of andan, final -n being probably pronounced as in French. It is possible that mes in sumes " you " is the same word as mds, since we also find sunuis-ma, though it could be the borrowed Sumerian mes ; at any rate, it affords no support for Hrozny's theory, not does the conglomerate sumes-mas-masr The Latin tepor, again, suggests to Hrozny that tapa-ss-as in an omen-tablet (K.B. ii, 2) signifies "fever", and accordingly he translates the verb uemiyazi, which occurs in connexion with it " erfasst ", making it a compound of " a preposition *' u, and the root of the Latin emere ! Ucmiya(nzi), however, is given as the equivalent of the ideograph KAR, which means " to carry away ", and tapa-ss-as " his tapa " cannot be dissociated from tapal " couple ", which has been borrowed from Assyrian and treated as a Hittite noun in -I. Tapal itself is a word borrowed from the Sumerian tap " double ", and assimilated to the Semitic kapalu " to double " ; and 1 Between a Varinic anun-tu-hi, " I made piecemeal of"?a compound, of ania$ "pieces" and the verb lu or du?and a Hittite akkus-kit the parallelism is exact. A good example of the results of Professor Hrozny \s " Indo-(?ermanic" obsession is his translation of the word khamexkhavza in the historical inscriptions, which he refers to 8kt. samd "summer" or bat. hie.ms "winter". The Vocabularies, however, tell us that khamenkuwar is the Ass. [ku]zzurn "to be gathered together", so that. makhkhnn-ma khamea-khanza kisat must mean, not " when the spring came", but "after that mobilization took place". 2 In K.B. ii, 7, Ohv. 17, mas-mas takes the place of ZUN. the ideograph of the plural: AN-MES TAK-ZI QI mas mas, " the gods belonging to the sacred stone."</page><page sequence="16">04 HITTITE LANGUAGE OV ItOUIIAZ KEUI lap-pu is found in the Hittite texts. The passages where Hrozny discovers his "fever" refer to the "double" or " representative " of the royal Sun-god and should be trans lated as follows : kuit-man-gan AN Samsi SAG MAT Neriqqa knit man-as-gan sard uizzi man-ma AN Samsi : tapa-ssa-s anda iH uemiyazi nu SUMES DUMUQ-rw NU DUMUQ, " both when the Sun-god is within the country of Neriqqa, and when he goes into (it), but the Sun-god's representative there carries him away, will the flesh-omens be propitious? Unpropitious " ; tapa-ssa-s kuis ana AN Samsi * ' kuit man-as abiya SAG MAT ALU Neriqqa nan tapa-ssa-s abiya uemiyazi, " he who is his representative * to the Sun-god ; when he is (huit) there in the city of Neriqqa, his representative I here carries him away." My last example of the dangers of a false method of decipherment is the word lingain, which Professor Hrozny connects with the Latin ligare. That it means " oath " is pretty clear, and Hrozny is certainly right in coupling it with linkiyas and similar words. But an unpublished text proves that it is really a compound. Here we read : Kas-a AN Marduk AN Innaraowantess-a lien gaoen, " and so the gods Merodach and Innaraowantes make an oath " (?), and three lines further : namnui AN Marduk AN Innaraowantess-a GIG ya lie tiyanteni, " then, O Merodach and Innaraowantes, do not draw near to the liver " (?). One of the most brilliant of Professor Hrozny's discoveries is that li or lie denoted the negative, and we must accordingly infer (1) that this negative can be declined like a noun, and (2) that in combination with the verb gauwar it has the sense of " swearing ", thus giving rise to a compound lingain, linkiyas, etc. Consequently, it is not surprising that we find what appears to be the plural lit in Yuzgat, Rev. 4, or that the negative ?i.l can be treated like a noun and provided with a pronominal suffix, e.g. ?l-watla, literally " the not-of-thee " (H.K.B., p. 212). It is needless to Unidentilled ideograph.</page><page sequence="17">IHTTITK LAN'JUAUti Or llOUHAZ KK1/I br, say that the categories of Indo-European grammar do not apply here.1 I now pass to the numerals. Here Professor Hrozny has demonstrated that khanle-izzis means " first " ; hence ]-edani must be read khantedani and " one " must be khante.'1 I believe there was also another word for " one ", since it seems to be the equivalent of the ideograph f-EN " one " in H.K.B., p. 210 ; namma f Bikhkhuniyas ill sa ALU (?asga iwar taparla, khudak inakhkhan ina ALU Gasga ni sa f-EN tapariyas ?sta, asi-ma f Bikhkhuniyas sa sarrultim iwar taparla, " then Bikhkhuniyas was not alone master of Kaska ; until after wards in Kaska there was not a single master, but sub sequently Bikhkhuniyas was alone master of the; kingdom." However this may be, Hrozny has shown that iugas ami tit-iugas correspond with the ideographically written " one year old " and " two years old ", i and to being respectively " one " and " two ". The word for " three " terminates in -es, and it is therefore worth noting that my decipherment of the Hittite hieroglyphic inscriptions makes tua and k?s " two " and " three ".; An interesting list of numerals, which, how ever, are not Hittite, has been published by Professor Hrozny from a vocabulary in which their Hittite equivalents are given ideographically. We learn from it that aika ---= 1, 1 The Assyrian C(|iii valent of lingain, etc., is nir* Hani, literally "the lifting up (of the hand to) the gods', hicn-gaowur would be literally " to sanctify non(-deeeits) ", yaowar being related to yaennas "priests" (see above, p. 61). (Jae.nnas, gaenas is the navuv of the &lt; ?reek Lydiaii inscriptions, the kuanis of the Hittite hieroglyphic texts, written ]^D in the Ordek-burnu inscription and borrowed by Hebrew, i.e. Canaanite, under the form of kohen. - The word occurs in one of my fragments : [kha)-an(ii nian-zi, and in the next line khaanti-i kuh-hu-[toanzi\ "he counts one ". 5 " Four" is mi and kar " ten '\ while "six " is probably nati-ni.

Hrozny supposes it to be Kharrian, but the name of the " Kharri " is more probably to be read Murri, and I see in them the Amontes of the Babylonian texts. In close contact as it thus was with Indo-European languages of various types?Indian, Iranian, Greek, and perhaps Kelto-Latin it is not surprising that Hittite was largely-influenced by them, while they in turn were influenced by Hittite and other Asianic forms of speech. Ja van, according to Genesis, was the brother of Meshech and Tubal. Hut, ?is Dr. Bork has remarked, no student of linguistic science who examines the structure of the sentence can imagine for a moment that it is an Indo-European language. Few Assyriologists, however, are also comparative philologists. Its most notable peculiarity is the conglomeration of all the pronouns and pronominal particles into a single word at the beginning of a sentence, reminding us of the American languages or of the Basque verb. Conglomerates like arakhzemis-wa-mu-za (KUR-KUR AMEL-KUR knie), " among-to-me-also-numerous (hostile countries being)," pdndu-waz asandu, " in-that-they-might-go (and) settle " (II.K.B., p. 110), or the forms in -/ quoted by Hrozny (S.H., p. bi),sarnikzi-cl "(he) clears (himself)", ispatuzzi-ela-ss-az "and they . . . (themselves) ", would be impossible in a language of the Indo-European type. Gender, again, is unknown to it ; in many cases, especially in the verb, no distinction is made between the singular and the plural ; there is no clear dis tinction in use between the verbal and nominal forms, the nominal suffixes -nza, -is, -i, etc, being employed in a verbal sense, not to speak of the suflix -/ ; and postpositions take the place of prepositions. The only prepositions are the borrowed 1 The numerals occur in the compound aika-mirfanna "in two l.-iv?-! s ", cl''.</page><page sequence="19">IMTTITK LAN&lt;iUA??l? Ol IMMillAX KEII t&gt;7 ana, ina, and istu, though the demonstrative particle nu occasionally follows the analogy of the Assyrian ana, and is used in its stead. Hut this was doubtless merely in " the language of the scribes ". It is now plain that ana and ina can no longer be regarded as borrowed by the Babylonians from the Hittites. But the fact remains that they are not Semitic. They were originally ana and in, the final vowel of ina being due to the analogy of an; in the inscriptions of Saigon of Akkad the word is still in. Now in and ana are the Greek tV and t\va ; and the conclusion therefore follows that they have been borrowed by Assyro-Babylonian from an Indo-European source. All this opens up a new vista in philological history. The indo-European languages must have been moulded into their leading forms, not in Europe or Central Asia, but in Asia Minor. Here, where bronze seems to have been first invented and from whence the use of iron spread through the Oriental world, would have been a primaeval meeting-place of languages, as the Caucasus still is to-day. We already knew that a con siderable part of the Greek vocabulary must be traced to Asia Minor ; we are now at liberty to believe that its grammar was shaped there as well, liven the hexameter, whirl? implies a long preceding period of artificial development, first appears on Asianic soil. And what is true of Greek must be also true of the other Indo-European languages. On the other hand, the Asianic languages must have been profoundly influenced by their Indo-European neighbours. Future research will have to determine on which side the borrowing has been in individual cases. The facts are only just rising above the horizon. Among these facts is the position of Sumerian. We knew that the Sumeriaus must have originally come from the Armenian highlands, for they brought the vine with them from the mountains of the north from which they had migrated. And between Sumerian and the newly revealed Hittite there are points of contact almost as striking as between Hittite and Indo-European ; the personal pronouns, for example, mi, si, ne, enz?n, and hi.</page><page sequence="20">OS HITTITE LANGUAGE OE liOUIIAZ KEUI Boghaz-Keui, or Khattu, which is interpreted " Silver " town iu the tablets, was not the original capital. This had been Arinna, which is interpreted "the Well-"eity. It would, therefore, have derived its name from a sacred well ; an offering to such a well is described in B.K. ii, 9, Rev. iv, 2, where it is associated with " Istar of Nineveh ". Arinna consequently appears to be the Phreata or " Wells " of Proleinys Geography which was iu Garsauria, and near Archelais, now Ak Serai. The name may be preserved in the neighbouring Arianzos, the hereditary property of Gregory of Nazianzen (see Ramsay, Historical Geography of Asia Minor, pp. 284-5). The site would suit that of Arini, captured by Tiglath-pileser I, which was not far from K ornar?a.1 The " Silver "-city took its name from the silver-mines of the Taurus, and was known to the Greeks in the Homeric Age. According to the Catalogue (11. ii, 856-7) Hodios, " the (commercial) Traveller," the damgar of the Cappadocian tablets, and Epistrophos, " the Agent," came to the aid of Troy from distant Halybe among the Halizonians, " where is the birthplace of silver." The Halizonians are the Khalitu of an inscription of the Vannic king Rusas II, who mentions them after the Muski-ni or Moschians and the Khate or Hittites.-5 Istar of Nineveh, like the other anthropomorphic deities of Asia Minor, was introduced there along with the other elements of Babylonian culture. But the old fetish-worship 1 iron images of the sacred wells, who were "daughters'1 of Tessub, were made by the city of Mamuantas, according to K.B. ii, 13, Ohv. 21 -4. The eldest was called "the excellence {dnh) of * the well Altannis, the Romanian ? " {Qumayannis), u-liile another well or spring bore the name o{ Tarkhana{s) from the god Tarkhu. The river Sign-signs was connected with them, but bow the mutilation of the tablet prevents us from knowing. Siga-sigas is written Sikassikas in K.B. ii, p. 44, 1. 25, M'here Altannis is stated to be " its excellence " {dnh-sas). - Hittite 2 later becomes /, as in Melitu (Malatiyeh) from Melix.

The ritual texts, for example, make frequent mention of the " ZI-Ql stones " of various gods to which the same adoration was paid as to the images of the divinities, and in one instance at least the determinative of " stone " is replaced by that of " god ". ZI-QI is literally " spirit messenger " ; the stone, in fact, was the embodiment of a spirit who delivered his messages through it. in the Hittite hieroglyphic texts the sacred stone is the ordinary symbol for " a god " or " goddess ", and it is depicted as being bound round with the consecrated coloured wool which marie its way into Greek ritual. The cult of the sacred stone long survived in Asia Minor and the regions influenced by it. The meteoric stone of Ephesus which later ages identified with Artemis is well known, and as late as the reign of the Roman Emperor Elagabalus a similar stone was worshipped in Syria. At Boghaz Keui the sacred stone seems to have been the embodiment of Attys, and we read in a ritual text (K.B. ii, 6, Obv. ii, 34) : im UD III KAM AN A-ti-is DU-is nu sa SARRU a-tam-ma l MU-an-na ME-as nan AN MAKH-ni pa-is, " on the third day Atis comes, to whom the King's son is com mitted for a year ; he gives him to the great goddess." In conclusion, it may be asked whether the Semitic languages also were affected by contact with the languages of Asia Minor. That Hittite was influenced by Assyro BabyIonian we know ; the Cappadocian tablets from Kara Kyuk show that there were Babylonian colonies in eastern Asia Minor as far back as the age of the third dynasty of Ur (2400 B.c.), and when the Hittites adopted the literary culture of Babylonia some two or three centuries later they borrowed plentifully both Assyrian and Sumerian words. But there is little evidence of borrowing in the opposite direction. The Hittite occupation of Canaan brought a few words like hohen " priest " or y ay in " wine " into the Hebrew lexicon, as well, 1 According to K.B. i. 57. .'I, m/?i//i-AN '/A'., "the child of ihr-slorm god,'' is a synonym of zurratti.</page><page sequence="22">TB HITTITK LANOUAt?K OF IMMUIAX KEUI probably, as the tendency for u (or iv) to become / (or //).
