<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seahorse. Robert A. Morris. 60pp. $2.50. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 10 East 53rd St., New York City 10022. 1972. (Grades 1-3) Although this is a very appealing book for young children who would enjoy having it read aloud to them, older boys and girls would gain an amazing amount of information about sea- horses by reading the book. The life cycle of the Atlantic Seahorse is beautifully illustrated by Arnold Lobel, and his use of blue, green, and grey tones represent the very essence of marine life. The author is most adept at relating the exciting experiences in the day of one male seahorse. In compact style the reader is intro- duced to the eating habits of the seahorse, its methods of securing protection from larger fish, and its interesting method of mating and caring for the young. One of the most remarkable antics of the seahorse is the use of fins, especially when confronted by danger as represented by the proximity of larger fish. Words such as Sargassum, Amberjack and Plankton are introduced so normally that even if they are not comprehended immediately, the illustrations presented on almost every page offer consistent and natural explanations of the marine environment. This is a beautiful little book to present to a child as a gift on any occasion, and may well be considered for inclusion in any primary grade classroom library.
