<plain_text><page sequence="1">Research Notes A Logogram for SIP, "Lord of the Deer' Bonn (Nikolai Grube). One of the elusive logographic signs that have escaped decipherment is a sign which shows an inverted vessel with a cross infix (Fig. 1 a). Although Thompson (1962) has not listed the sign as a separate grapheme, Macri and Looper (2003:245) classify the sign as a discrete grapheme with the code ZV2. In the published literature, the sign is often referred to as the "inverted vase" sign. The sign shares this name with another, very similar looking sign which is distinct Fig. 1. a) The "inverted vase with crossed bands" (IVCB) sign; b) The female title T1001 Fig. 2. a) The ICVB sign with clearly recognizable deer antlers. Yaxchilan Lnt. 34; b) An ICVB sign with deer antlers from an early Classic ceramic vessel (Flellmuth 1987: Fig. 45); c)The ICVB sign with deer antlers and the number VII from a codex style vase from the former through aK' IN infix instead of the cross (182 in the Thompson catalogue, ZV 1 in Macri and Looper 2003; Fig. 1 b). The sign with theK'IN infix appears together with the female head IX(IK) "woman" in the well known female title (1001 in the Thompson catalogue) which often precedes female names, particularly in inscriptions from the Usumacinta region. There can be hardly any doubt that the inverted vase with theK'IN infix refers to the old water goddess called Chak Chel (probably "great rainbow") in the Codices, who so often is displayed pouring out water from ajar. The decipherment that will be offered here is for the similar looking, but clearly distinct inverted jar sign with the crossed bands infix (IVCB). The IVCB sign has received little attention by scholars, al though it figures prominently in king's names and epithets (such as in Yaxchilan) and on codex style ceramics. A compari son of all occurrences of the sign in the hieroglyphic corpus immediately clarifies that the IVCB sign always occurs in conjunction with a superfix, which most scholars have tran scribed as T124. Close inspection shows that this sign is not T124, the syllable tzi (and in the context of the Initial Series Introductory Glyph, the logogram TZIK "count"), but that it represents stylized deer antlers, the sign numbered 291 in Thompson's catalogue (Lopes and Davletshin 2004). This is particularly obvious in early examples, such as Yaxchilan Lintels 22 and 34 (Fig. 2a), the San Diego Cliff Carving (Scheie 1989:2), an example from an Early Classic tripod vessel (Fig. 2b) but also on many codex style ceramics (Fig. 2c). Maya scribes themselves often were not very careful in marking the distinc tion between T124 and the deer antler sign T291. The deer antler superfix provides a hint for the reading of the IVCB sign. Further clues come from contexts, where the IVCB sign is replaced by the head of the old deer god. At Yaxchilan, the Fig. 3. Comparison of two nominal clauses of Bird Jaguar IV from Yaxchilan Lnt. 1, C2-A3 and Lnt. 21 (D6-D7) Vol. XXXIV • Dezember 2012</page><page sequence="2">1VCB sign is embedded in title phrases of two kings, Bird Jaguar I from the Early Classic and Bird Jaguar IV from the Late Classic Period. On the monuments of Bird Jaguar IV's reign, the IVCB sign usu ally occurs as part of a string of names of celestial deities: Fig. 4. The old Deer God blowing TE"ku-yu 1VCB CHAN-na a conch shell, Kerr 1384 T1073head (for example, on Lnts.21,39, Stela l,St.33,La Pasadita Lnt. 1 ) (Fig. 3a) Within the same title sequence ofBird Jaguar IV, the IVCB is replaced by the head of the deer god with his typical black markings around the eyes: TE-ku-yu Deer God CHAN-na-T1073head(for example, onLnt. 1 (Fig.3b)This is certainly the same long lipped deer god with dark crescents that wrap around the outer corners of the mouth which is illustrated on many Codex Style ceramics (Figs. 4,7). In the case of Lintel 1, the deer antlers are not attached to the IVCB sign but to the forehead of the god. Another context, where the IVCB sign shows up with frequency is the 819-day count (Fig. 5). Here, the IVCB is inserted between a direction and its pertinent colour and a still undeciphered "mystery" sign, T739, which precede the head of K'awiil and the titlçJun Ch 'ok "one prince" or "one young boy" (see Kelley 1976: Fig. 17). In the 819-day counts from Yaxchilan Lintel 30 (Fig. 6) and Quirigua Stela K, the IVCB is replaced by the head of the Deer God, confirming the substitution pattern discovered in the Yaxchilan title string. Although the arrangement of the ele ments of the 819-day count from the Palenque T emple 18 Jambs is a little bit different, the glyphs also include a colour prefix (in this case IK', "black") before the head of the deer god, while the 819-day count on the Palace Tablet includes an IVCB sign. The head of the Deer God is that of an old, wrinkled man with darkness markings over or around the large eyes, a prominent nose and a chin beard or dark crescents around the corners of the mouth. His characteristics also include large antlers and deer ears (Zender 1999:77-82; Stone and Zender 2011:185). T aube notes that the prominent black body striping found with this being also appears as the camouflage of Maya hunters (Taube 2003: 473). This is clearly the same deity who is displayed emerging from a serpent blowing the conch shell trumpet on many painted Maya ceramics, such as Kerr 1384, 1882 and2572 (Fig. 4). He may also be identical with the old Deer God resting on a palace bench in the company of maidens and other anthropomorphic deer beings (Kerr 8927). This deity also appears as Zimmermann's God Y in the Codices (1956: Fig. 4. The old Deer God blowing a conch shell, Kerr 1384 Fig. 5. The 819 Day Count passage from Palenque, Palace Tablet, C2-D3 Fig. 6. The 819 Day Count passage from Yaxchilan, Lnt. 30, E3-F4 Tafel 6) (Fig. 7).

The hieroglyph WUK si- the month Sip was when hunt pu from Dresden 13c ers did their rituals to the gods of chase, which include, among others, a Suhui Dzip (sujuysip, "virgin Sip") (Tozzer 1944:155). A variant of the SIP logogram Another sign substitutes for the head of the Sip God or the IVCB sign in an 819-day count on a black background incised vase from Palenque (Fig. 10). Here, the position between the direction, the colour and the mysterious T739 compound is taken by a glyph which consists of a deer-antler superfix attached to a sign superficially resembling the syllable MO. This rare sign has no counterpart in monumental inscriptions. However,averysimilarsign(Sign52inZimmermann 1956; 159 in Thompson 1962 and APJ in Macri and Looper 2009: 59) appears in the Dresden and Madrid Codices (Fig. 11). This glyph was not recognized as that of an animal in publications before Knorozov (1955: 53), who interpreted it as a glyph for a peccary, kitam. The three occurrences of this glyph in the Fig. 7.

Three occurrences of theSIP glyph in the Madrid Codex (after Kelley 1976:Fig. 43) Fig. 13. The hieroglyphWUK SIP la, wuk sipal on Kerr 1152 the associated image shows a clear-cut peccary. David Kelley found the association of this glyph with different animals "disconcerting", but concluded that a "generic word which might apply equally to peccary, armadillo, and deer would be welcome ..." (Kelley 1976: 120). I suggest that the glyph in question, like the IVCB sign, also refers to the god of deer and protector of animals, SIP. In contemporary Yucatec mythol ogy, the Sip has the shape of a little deer, but he is the protector of all wild animals (ba 'alche 'o 'ob) whom he anxiously guards and protects using a conch-shell trumpet in order to summon them (Zender 1999:79-80). Therefore, in Yucatec belief there is a Sip Kej forthe large deer as well as a Sip Yuk for the brocket deer, a Sip Kitam forthe peccary and a Sip Tzulub forthe agouti (Ruholl 1995:154-155). This function ofthe Sip as the protec tor of wild animals in general explains why theSIP logogram appears with different animals in the Madrid Codex. The Contexts ofthe Sip Glyph On many Codex style ceramics, the IVCB sign appears as part of a string ofnamesoftheBabyJaguar,whichis thrown by the Death God and Chaak into the Underworld. In these nominal phrases, the IVCB sign always has the numerical prefix 7 (WUK), which establishes a clear parallel to the Yucatec name WukfYohl) Sip ofthe protector ofthe animals (Figs. 13and 14). Although the Jaguar Baby is not marked with deer attributes in any of these scenes, there can be no doubt that these complex scenes deal with multiple transformations, and it is very likely that Wuk Sip was one of the identities materialized by the Jaguar Baby. In this context it is important that the Sip is a protector of all kind of wild animals and that he is involved in the transformation of animals that takes place in the month of September: "It is generally believed that during the month of September, all animals of certain kinds change their forms into those of other animals. In September the deer are in heat and act boldly and strangely, sometimes entering the villages. It is believed that at this season the deer turn into snakes, and the snakes into deer" (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 208). Among the Cruzoob of Quintana Roo this particular phenom enon is called Jéelep, and informants can precisely describe how animals transform into other animals, so that for example a peccary will always turn into an armadillo in September (Gorissen 1995). September is also the time when the Maya of San Luis, Petén, and San Antonio Toledo performed the deer 140 ^ Av % *5 Fig. 14. The transformation scene on the vase Kerr 521 mexicon • Vol. XXXIV • Dezember 2012</page><page sequence="4">dance, when Thompson wrote his ethnography of the Maya of British Honduras. Thompson points out that "it may not be any more than a coincidence that the festival of the hunters was held, according to Landa, on 7 Zip at the time of the conquest. 7 Zip corresponded in the old Julian reckoning to September 1" (Thompson 1930: 103-104). I suggest that the "throwing ofthe jaguar baby" scenes on Codex Style ceramics are related to the phenomenon of Jéelep among the Cruzoob Maya, and that these scenes are also linked to a particular period of time in the solar year, since almost all of these scenes take place during the month of K'ayab'. Even less transparent is the function of the Sip deity in the context of the 819 day count. The close connection with the K'awiil logogram sug gests that K'awiil may have head a deer aspect, but any speculations in this regard will have to wait until we have a better understanding of the meaning of the 819 Day Count in general. In the title string associated with Bird Jaguar IV of Y axchilan, the Deer God may have been a particular facet of the celestial deity whose head follows after the CHAN "sky" logogram. Unfortunately, this head variant also remains with out decipherment until now. However, the identification of the SIP logogram may help to open up new perspectives on the interpretation of the little understood deity names and mytho logical narratives underlying all of these contexts.
