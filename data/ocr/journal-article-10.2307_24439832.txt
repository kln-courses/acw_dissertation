Drawing from disparate traditional sources like Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Emerson, as well as contemporary advocates of virtue ethics like Nussbaum, Foot, and Williams, the essay shows that the central contentions of IE, including especially the principle of ontological equality, must either express commitments grounded in the particular perspectives we already inhabit, or be without rational or ethical force for us. Keywords: ethical individualism, foundationalism, information ethics, particular ism, virtue ethics. I can think of no better way to begin an essay on the information ethics (IE) of Floridi and Sanders than with the words of Emerson: "Every surmise and vaticination of the mind is entitled to a certain respect, and we learn to prefer imperfect theories, and sentences which contain glimpses of truth, to digested systems which have no one valuable suggestion" (Emerson 1982b, 77). While there are glimpses of truth in IE, its inherent foundationalism and extreme impartialism and universalism cannot do full justice to the rich data of ethical experience. To show this, it is requisite to unpack an alternative account that is explicitly antifoundationalist and fully agent-relative. I shall present a virtue ethics alternative to IE that conceives our ethical obligations as emerging from within our various particular perspectives instead of being imposed on us from the outside. Obviously, it is not possible to rigorously explore every nuance of these competing perspectives, but the point is a metaphilosophical comparison of these schools' defining commitments. In considering the alternatives side by side, it will become clear why the central contentions of IE, including especially the principle of ontological equality, must either express commitments grounded in the particular perspectives we already inhabit, or be without rational or ethical force for us. Floridi proposes IE as a solution to an alleged "foundationalist crisis" in computer ethics, emerging from the realization that information itself © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="2">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 381 is increasingly an object of concern in ethical discourse. Floridi argues that putting information at the heart of ethics results in an "ontocentric" theory, concerned with what things are, in contrast to the "situated action ethics" of the standard utilitarian, contractualist, and deontological alternatives. This ontocentrism issues in a very broad understanding of what commands moral respect: "From an IE perspective, the ethical discourse now comes to concern information as such, that is not just all persons, their cultivation, well-being and social interactions, not just animals, plants and their proper natural life, but also anything that exists, from paintings and books to stars and stones; anything that may or will exist, like future generations; and anything that was but is no more, like our ancestors" (Floridi 1999, 43). This perspective issues in the "ontological equality principle," which asserts that "any form of reality (any instance of information), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys an initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature" (44). Like virtue ethics, and in contrast to other alternatives, IE directs us to become good stewards of the "infosphere" by adopting an appropriate concern for what things are and what they are becoming, such that we construct a better world overall: "Ethics is not only a question of dealing morally well with a given world. It is also a question of constructing the world, improving its nature and shaping its development in the right way" (Floridi and Sanders 2005, 195). In light of its emphasis on construction, the distance between virtue ethics and IE is not vast, but the fissure that separates them runs deep. Indeed, redirecting attention to good construction may be the most important contribution of the information turn, and the recovered emphasis on poiesis will be enthusiastically embraced by the proponent of virtue ethics. However, while virtue ethics can and should agree with Floridi and Sanders (2004) that specifying agency is relative to one's level of abstraction, such that humans constitute but a subset of those information entities that are agents, IE incorrectly supposes that there are judgments regarding the being and flourishing of information entities that are not bound to the perspective of some agent, and that these judgments can enter into human decisions about what to do and who to be. As we shall see, virtue ethics is not narrowly anthropocentric and rejects shallow subjectivism, but it does assert a fundamental role for agents in the evaluation and construction of the universe: While virtue ethics concedes that any information entity (not just humans) might merit respect and admiration for being/becoming what it is, that respect has to be earned by honest argument from information available within the perspective of the agent who admires and respects, rather than being perceived from the point of view of the universe, a point of view that is not the point of view of any actual agent and may in fact be antagonistic to the integrity of actual agents. Of course, the refusal of virtue ethics to abstract away from the messy particulars of lives as they are actually lived makes it difficult to find one's bearings in a manifest plurality of considerations. In contrast, IE purports to ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="3">382 RICHARD VOLKMAN solve a foundationalist crisis in computer ethics by getting at a single notion that can make sense of all the rest. We should be skeptical, however, of the notion that ethical discourse and understanding is served by the search for such foundations. "Theory typically uses the assumption that we probably have too many ethical ideas, some of which may well turn out to be mere prejudices. Our major problem now is actually that we have not too many but too few, and we need to cherish as many as we can" (Williams 1985, 117). It would be most ironic if a philosophy that asserts the fundamental value of information as such should be eager to abstract from the concrete information needed to make one's way in the world. We experience a world of incommensurable and conflicting values, and we must be careful not to smooth this over in first principles of ethical theory. Virtue ethics eschews foundations and proposes we start where we are. This approach will occasion objections of relativism. Just how diverse human virtues actually are is an empirical matter, but in principle virtue ethics embraces a narrow sort of relativism as against the extreme impartialism and universalism of IE. We shall see that such relativism does not run contrary to our actual ethical experience, and even accounts for data the impartialist alternative cannot. History, Historicism, and Context Floridi repeatedly intimates that IE is simply the next logical step in a long historical dialectic from the anthropocentric, particular, partial, and paro chial toward universal and impartial verities in ethics. "Investigations have led researchers to move from more restricted to more inclusive, anthropo centric criteria and then further on towards biocentric criteria. As the most recent stage in this dialectical development, IE maintains that even biocentric analyses are still biased and too restricted in scope" (Floridi 2002, 297). However, the siren of historicist reasoning must be resisted here as elsewhere; as usual, a closer inspection reveals this is, as Popper puts it, "merely one of the many instances of metaphysical theories seemingly confirmed by facts—facts which, if examined more closely, turn out to be selected in the light of the very theories they are supposed to test" (1985, 300). To be sure, there is a certain tendency among students of philosophy to conceive the unfolding of the history of moral theory as progress from the narrow parochialism of virtue ethics, to the aspirations of universal and impartial theories like deontology and utilitarianism, to an even more universal and impartial understanding in environmental ethics. Reading history this way, IE looks like the next and obvious step. But this is a very selective and distorted history. Throughout the Middle Ages it made sense to "take for granted, as we take the ground we stand on, the premise that the most important function of ethical theory is to tell you what sort of life is most desirable, or most worth living. That is, the point of ethics is that it is good for you, that it serves your self-interest" (Hunt 1999, 72). Even since the Enlightenment there has remained an important strand © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="4">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 383 of thought challenging the notion that ethics requires impartiality and universality—to name just a very few obvious and illustrious cases, we have Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Emerson in the nineteenth century, and Foot and Williams and Nussbaum and the whole resurgence of virtue ethics since. With this pedigree, unrepentant opponents of universalism and impartialism cannot be cast as mere fringe characters. Furthermore, this alternative historical emphasis indicates that the drive to be universal and impartial is a newcomer to ethical discourse, and it remains to be seen whether it will ultimately be judged a wrong turn. Even the figures that seem to be most friendly to IE are at best mixed in their support. Plato and the Stoics are often cited as precursors to IE (e.g., Floridi 2006, 31), but both traditions appreciated the importance of grounding moral concern in the good life. The Stoics exerted tremendous influence on Nietzsche and Emerson, both of whom regard the rejection of impartialism and universalism as not only consistent with but even required by an appropriate reverence and affirmation with respect to the unfolding of Nature and logos. In light of Floridi's repeated emphasis on impartialism and universalism in his articulation and defense of IE, and especially the principle of ontological equality, any honest evaluation of IE needs to address itself to the ethical tradition that eschews impartialism and universalism while affirming the constructionist vocation of humanity. In particular, we need to ask what it can mean to be a good creator if one is unwilling or unable to discriminate between the information entities that merit respect and admiration and those that have not earned this status. If the act of creation is always an effort to inflict one's self on the world, as Nietzsche would have it, or if Nature is a manifestation of the self-reliant creation of one's life, as Emerson would have it, then not everything automatically commands respect as the thing it is. To evaluate IE, we need to critically interrogate the universalism and impartialism it takes to the extreme. "Unlike other non-standard ethics, IE is more impartial and universal—or one may say less ethically biased—because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a centre of moral claims, which now includes every instance of information, no matter whether physically implemented or not" (Floridi 1999, 43). If impartialism and universalism turn out to be undesirable in themselves, at least when carried beyond their appropriate domains, then much of ethics since the Enlightenment has been a mistake, with IE as the most recent and most glaring example. In that case, the great historical contribution of IE will be to reveal once and for all the absurdity of extending impartiality and universality where they do not belong. Impartialism and Universalism Within the Limits of Reason Alone Of course, it would be absurd to suppose that a just account of ethics could entirely dispense with notions of impartiality and universality. ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">384 RICHARD VOLKMAN After all, the referee acts wrongly who decides the game based on whom he likes better rather than the competitors' performance according to the rules of the game. While nothing could be more obvious, note that this reasoning is what Floridi calls "situated action ethics." It is no coincidence that notions of impartiality and universality make their greatest impact in the history of philosophy just as constructionist concerns fade in favor of moral theory that focuses on action. While rules of conduct and policy are certainly bound in their formulation and application by considerations of impartiality and universality, policy and rules of conduct are but the smallest part of normative discourse as a whole. Let us mark off this part of normative discourse by the designation "politics," since it deals with matters of policy rather than the constructionist concerns of virtue and flourishing. This distinction reveals that impartiality and universalism are appropriate in circumstances of conflict or competition, especially involving relations of strangers or neighbors in contrast to friends and family. Impartiality and universalism are ideals associated with justice—the virtue concerned with giving others their due. But justice only arises as a concern when one might be tempted to give less than others are due. "When men are friends, there is no need of justice" (Aristotle 2009, VIII: 1). Not only is justice unnecessary among friends, it is positively unwelcome, as are the impartialism and universalism that characterize it. It has become a commonplace, starting especially with Kant and Bentham, to suppose that an attitude of universal impartiality is simply a requirement of reason itself. On this view, it is irrational to cast one's self as an exception to some universal rule or policy without some justification, since that would involve asserting an arbitrary difference. If it is wrong for you to lie to me, then I have to admit it is wrong for me to lie to you; if my pleasure counts in what should be done, then I have to admit that your pleasure counts too. If there is some reason why I count and you don't (or vice versa), then I need to be prepared to show the difference that justifies the difference in treatment. If ethics is conceived as casting about for just such rules of conduct, on the grounds that reasons for action must apply equally for everyone as reasons, then it follows that ethical reasons must be of the sort one is willing to apply equally to everyone, without special reference to one's own concerns or circumstance. In this way, impartiality and universality of reasons for action interpenetrate and reinforce one another as the conditions of rational principles for guiding conduct. But this focus on reasons for action, as if the agent is a calculator or database of rules, misses most of what really matters in ethics, and it is not at all the only way to conceive rationality. Nussbaum unpacks the virtue ethics alternative in her essay "The Discernment of Perception: An Aristotelian Conception of Rationality." Since virtue ethics is especially concerned with good construction of one's self in one's actual circum stance, rather than narrowly worrying about activity in the abstract, the creative act of choice must embrace all the particulars that make one's life © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="6">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 385 make sense as the particular unfolding story it is. As Nussbaum argues, "excellent choice cannot be captured in general rules, because it is a matter of fitting one's choice to the complex requirements of a concrete situation" (1990, 71). It is significant that proponents of situated action ethics tend to illustrate ethical choice by means of a few thin descriptions of some agent (often named A or B) in some abstractly specified situation; in contrast, Nussbaum indicates that it takes a novel to properly capture ethical choice as it actually takes place. To boil down all the facts into the thin descriptions of casuistry is to have already done all the real ethical work behind the scenes, instead of confronting the messy multitude of competing claims and appeals we find in every moment of real life, and Floridi is surely correct that the transformative circumstance of the information age speaks against treating all the ethical work regarding who I am and who I aspire to become as already complete once and for all behind the scenes. Construction matters if we are to understand ethics in the Information Age. Having identified construction as the vocation of ethics in the Information Age, we need to sort out what is to be constructed and along what dimensions. Aristotelian virtue ethics rejects the notion that everything that is good can be boiled down and weighed along a single dimension; the only way to face the radical pluralism and incommensur ability of goods as they appear in our ethical experience is to learn how to process all this information in the complicated way indicated by percep tual awareness. That is, one has to learn how to see good and bad: "The discernment rests with perception" (Aristotle, qtd. Nussbaum 1990, 66). Deliberation informed by right perception is something one does, not a rule one follows, and it is only learned by disciplined practice under the tutelage of good mentors and exemplars; it cannot be summed up in a catalogue of rules any more than one can become a great musician by reading a book. "Good deliberation," says Nussbaum, "is like theatrical or musical improvisation, where what counts is flexibility, responsiveness, and openness to the external; to rely on an algorithm here is not only insufficient, it is a sign of immaturity and weakness" (1990, 74). The conception of rationality assumed by situated action ethics ignores much of concrete concern in the unfolding story of actual life, and such an ethics is too impoverished to do justice to our ethical experience of values of good construction. If we are concerned fundamentally with making something of ourselves, then we cannot accept action-oriented ethics. This is a point most famously made by Bernard Williams in his analysis of integrity (Williams 1988). Williams offers cases in which an agent is confronted with an action that goes against some ethical commitment that has come to constitute a central part of his identity, but which would surely result in a better outcome in terms of some favored conception of the "overall good" advocated by consequentialism. The point is that the agent's integrity is not accounted for in the consequentialist tallying of the ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="7">386 RICHARD VOLKMAN "overall good," no matter what one's specific value theory says, since the consequentialist approach to ethics implies the agent who is committed to doing the right thing must be prepared to abandon his own constitutive commitments whenever an objective tallying of the overall good requires it, and being so prepared is already to have abandoned one's integrity. One's integrity cannot be simply weighed against other considerations as if it was something commensurable with them. Being prepared to do that is already to say one will be whatever the utilitarian standard says one must be, which is to have already abandoned one's integrity. The priority of the particular in Aristotelian ethics emphasizes that our moral experience is shot through with this sort of radical incommensurability, and constructing a good life out of such material requires real sensitivity and judgment. Rules and policies are no substitute for this. In my experience, proponents of situated action ethics are impatient with this line of reasoning. This is generally because they misunderstand the nature of the argument; they think it attempts to assert some contradictory observation against deontology or utilitarianism, as if the point was that utilitarianism is logically incapable of giving the right answer in Williams's cases. (Or worse, they mistake Williams's point to be that integrity trumps every other consideration; anyone who thinks that needs to go back and reread the previous paragraph more carefully.) So, they make great efforts to show how their favored theory manages to give the right answer after all, and we get tortured explanations showing that utilitarians can say it is wrong to shoot one Indian to save twenty others, or whatever. But this utterly misses the point. It is exactly that sort of misplaced puzzle-solving rationality that is the problem. Williams makes it clear that his cases are supposed to be real moral quandaries. No one can say with confidence whether or not it would be right to shoot one Indian to save twenty. Respecting one's integrity requires that one muddle through and see an impossible circumstance for the impossible case it is. That does not mean integrity overrides other concerns; it means that the relevant concerns cannot all be weighed alongside each other on a common scale. What's more, as Nussbaum emphasizes, it is not at all obvious that the right answer has to be the same no matter who the particular agent is, no matter who the particular Indians are, and no matter how these are related. What is the actual history that puts one in this circumstance of choice? What does it mean for the characters of the story to be shot? What does it mean for the shooter? The significance of these matters cannot be settled by the guidance of any simple algorithm without violence to one's integrity as a deliberative agent, which means that one's integrity is not accounted for by any such algorithm. Therefore, assuming, as most would grant, that integrity has any value at all, whatever else the algorithm might be good for, it does not account for everything of ethical value. No such algorithm captures the whole of ethics. However things turn out for the proponent of situated action © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="8">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 387 ethics, these arguments are particularly telling against IE's uncritical acceptance of impartialism and universalism, since IE purports to value construction, and integrity is a constitutive virtue of a valuable structure. To understand the ethical cost of abandoning the concrete perspective of actual agents, it helps to reflect on the sentiment expressed by Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov regarding the proposal that an eternal harmony of the universe answers the problem of evil. The usual conclusion of the Argument from Evil is that God does not exist, since an all-knowing, all powerful, all-good God would not permit the evil we see in the world. One standard retort, captured powerfully and poetically in the answer from the whirlwind of the book of Job, is that God knows what He is doing even if the particulars of God's plan are often beyond our limited understandings. The usual countermove says assertions of God's plan are question begging, but Ivan makes a much more subtle and challenging response. He does not mean to deny God's existence; he means to indict God for crimes against humanity, and especially against innocent children. Given everything he knows and believes and sees, it is simply not acceptable to trade off the suffering of innocent children against even an eternity of perfect harmony and perfection. In asserting this, Ivan concedes that the trade-off might make sense to God. It may even make sense to certain humans. But Ivan wants none of that. "Perhaps it really may happen that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child's torturer, 'Thou art just, O Lord!' but I don't want to cry aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child" (Dostoevsky 2010, chap. 35). Whatever may be true from some other perspective, Ivan cannot countenance the calculation that permits children to be thrown to dogs. To come to appreciate the calculation from God's point of view, even if possible, would not settle the matter in God's favor, and it would in fact constitute an ethically disastrous failure of integrity, as it would mean Ivan's ceasing to be what he is and becoming what he is not, what he in fact abhors. Even if Ivan's perspective and his perception are in some sense more limited and parochial than the all-knowing God, those limits are themselves constitutive of Ivan and of what it means to be successful as being what he is. As so often happens, the point is captured by Aristotle in an observation that at once appears perfectly banal and utterly profound: "No one chooses to possess the whole world if he has first to become someone else" (Aristotle 2009, IX:4). An ethics that adopts some point of view other than the agent's own may not be relevant to the agent's evaluation of things. However things may seem from the perspective of the principle of ontological equality, there is no reason to assume it has anything to do with me. Although I cannot succeed in my life by becoming someone else, it is equally true that my own success depends on extending my self by ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="9">388 RICHARD VOLKMAN including others in my very constitution. By far the most celebrated and widely discussed counterexamples to the pervasiveness of impartiality and universality focus on friendship and similar close personal relation ships, and with good reason. In cases of love and friendship, "the agent's own historical singularity (and/or the historical singularity of the relation ship itself) enter into moral deliberation in a way that could not even in principle give rise to a universal principle, since what is ethically important (among other things) is to treat the friend as a unique nonreplaceable being, a being not like anyone else in the world" (Nussbaum 1990, 72). We have already noted that friendship excludes justice, and we are now in a position to locate the crucial difference in the very being of the friendship. While anything like a complete account is well beyond the scope of this essay, even a sidelong glance in the direction of friendship reveals not only what mere politics misses but also what virtue ethics has to contribute. Specifically, we can begin to sketch the ontological orientation of virtue ethics in unpacking friendship, revealing that partiality and particularity do not entail a narrow conception of self and other or a shallow account of the relations that bind us together. On Aristotle's view, the friend is a "second self," in a quite literal sense that can be illustrated by a metaphor (inspired by Emerson 1982a): What I am and how I relate to others can be imagined as the expanding ripples on the surface of a pond upon the introduction of a stone. The boundaries that define an individual are the circles pushing out across the surface (represent ing the whole of the infosphere, if you like), with other individuals similarly represented as circles pushing out from their own distinct points of entry. The whole of one's life is the history of those circles as they expand through the pond, including especially the complicated emergent properties that issue from encounters with the ripples that are other lives. The resulting patterns become hopelessly intertwined and fused, and it becomes impossible to distinguish any precise boundaries. Whether a given part of the pond "belongs" to one or another wave becomes a hopeless question, but it remains that each circle expands from its own center, and that it pushes out to make more sophisticated patterns that are part of the story of expansion from that center. To tell the story of these waves, it is more than a bit helpful to identify the entrance of the stone as the "center of narrative gravity," to use Dennett's (1992) apt expression, which is all we need the self to be in a virtue ethics account. (Of course, the self might be something more substantial, but I take it to be at least a center of narrative gravity.) As the metaphor illustrates, selves overlap, and this is a matter of fundamental importance for the analysis of those human relations that are not matters of politics. To understand one's life is to make sense of its constitutive elements and their relations in coherent whole, and that includes the people whose lives are literally part of one's self. The friend is a second self, since there is no distinguishing one's own interests from those of one's friends. There is no question of whether doing something valuable for one's son is a benefit © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="10">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 389 for him or for one's self, any more than it makes sense to ask whether a tax break for a married couple filing jointly is a legal benefit for the husband or for the wife. Thus, the friend is valued for her own sake, and not as an instrument or from duty. Make no mistake about it, there is excellent reason to make friends; friendship is a construction that makes each of us greater than we could be apart. It follows that I have excellent reasons to make myself the sort of thing that can enter into these relations, and this is a sufficient consideration to underwrite all the various social virtues (e.g., honesty, compassion, benevolence) without appeal to impartiality or universality. These points about the relation of one's self to one's friends apply equally well to the manifold other goods that constitute the good life. The contours of one's life story are composed of the various projects, values, and commitments that interact to define the narrative center of gravity, like so many stones in the pond. These considerations cannot be reduced or boiled down without distortion or extirpation of real pieces of one's self. "If thy eye offend thee, pluck is out" is one imperative; "Learn to see well" is quite another. Only the latter is consistent with the full flourishing of one's self as having all good things in the right proportion, which is the central concern of eudaimonia. Safety is good, but it is not the only good. Hence, I must become the sort of thing that cares not too much for safety and not too little for safety—I must be courageous. Pleasure is good but, if we agree that safety is also good and not reducible to pleasure, pleasure is plainly not the only good. Hence, I must become the sort of thing that cares not too much or too little for pleasure—I must be temperate rather than gluttonous or puritanical. Even anger is a good, in the right proportion, defining good temper against slavish submissiveness. But too much anger, or inappropriate anger, or anger that lingers makes one a hothead or short tempered or sulky, and these traits threaten to upset one's navigation through the crashing waves in the great sea of competing claims of value. This is the level of description adopted by virtue ethics, and these observations may be obscured if we reflect on the stuff of our lives from any other level of description. The imperative to make something of my self is not chosen; it is thrust upon me by being what I am. It is a mistake of the highest order to suppose that this project of construction can be simplified by theory, or that there is an imperative standing outside the constructionist imperative that conditions it without entering into it. Justice is a good. Benevolence is a good. These are virtues that can be affirmed from within the viewpoint described above. But the imperialism of these considerations that opposes one's ability to become who one is must be opposed by the whole project. My life is already overfull in crafting for myself a character that manifests all the virtues (including justice and benevolence) without imagining a requirement that imposes further obligations of some alleged outside authority. We should say of impartiality and universalism in ethics what Foot suggests regarding the related notion of "the best ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">390 RICHARD VOLKMAN outcome" as it relates to benevolent concern for others' welfare: "It is not that in the guise of 'the best outcome' [the idea of maximum welfare] stands outside morality as its foundation and arbiter, but rather that it appears within morality as the end of one of the virtues" (1988, 238; emphasis in original). To suppose otherwise is to suppose we have found the universal acid that permits us to dissolve all good things into a single thin solution for weighing and comparison. No, pleasure is not such a universal acid. Nor is information. Obviously, the observation that neither pleasure nor information can serve this role is a substantive premise that could be disputed, but this deep pluralism about value is a central feature of the virtue ethics perspective, and IE generally accepts value pluralism even as it strives to maintain its extreme impartiality and universality. While calling attention to this tension in IE, most of this description of virtue ethics is perfectly congenial to the information turn. Nothing in virtue ethics supposes that the agents are anything but information entities, or that only human agents are agents. The representation of agents as interacting waves in a field of possible interac tions is perfectly suited to elaboration in terms of information. However, the analysis so far indicates the sense in which IE's abstract theorizing and searching for ethical foundations may expresses a disdain for our informa tion-rich lives. The level of abstraction at which ontological equality holds is not the perspective of our actual lives, and it is not obvious that it generates any reasons for us at the perspective relevant to ethics. Virtue ethics proposes that, if we take the information turn, we do best to start where we are instead of positing external and information-impoverished points of view as foundational. "The foundationalist enterprise ... has now generally been displaced in favor of a holistic type of model, in which some beliefs can be questioned, justified, or adjusted while other are kept constant, but there is no process by which they can all be questioned at once or all justified in terms of (almost) nothing" (Williams 1985, 113). Let us forget foundations in ethics, and instead start our construction project where we are. If we start where we are, we discover ourselves to be powerful information-processing systems whose greater perfection consists in ordering and understanding and appreciating and creating from the materials at hand. You Can't See Nothing from Nowhere Ontological equality supposes that all information entities merit respect and enjoy a (minimal, overridable) right to flourish as the things they are. But this can only seem to be the case if we imagine a perspective that is not tied to any particular history or situation—what Sidgwick famously describes as "the point of view of the universe." In contrast, if we start where we are, as the particular characters we are becoming, we can be prepared to affirm the value of any information entity we encounter, and it may turn out that every information entity merits my respect and © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 391 should flourish as the thing it is, in which case the object-level judgments of virtue ethics and IE may have an identical extension. But that is certainly not the way things appear from the start. As soon as one appeals to a sufficiently concrete level of abstraction, we find a raucous competi tion between the flourishings of various info entities, and even a competition between alternative descriptions of the same info entity. Before proceeding, we need to acknowledge the role in IE of particular applied ontologies in the formulation of policies and life plans. Ontological equality is not proposed as a rich guide to action, and the point of view of the universe was never intended to supplant our particular points of view. Rather, ontological equality was intended as supplement and corrective to the tendency of particular viewpoints to be totalizing and tyrannical. "The description of the specific essence of classes of information entities is a task to be left to a plurality of ontologies ... IE relies on the agent's knowledge for the implementation of the right action" (Floridi 1999, 45). It may seem that there is no deep conflict between virtue ethics and IE after all, since the ontologies that inform our actual conduct are presumably the constitutive considerations emerging from the personal point of view described above. "I am using 'ontology' to cover the outcome of a variety of processes that allow an agent to appropriate (be successfully embedded in), semanticize (give meaning to and make sense of) and conceptualize (order, understand and explain) her environment" (Floridi 2007, 5). These various ontologies are related to the levels of abstraction one adopts in coming at a problem, since, "a LoA [level of abstraction] rather expresses (often only implicitly) a specific ontological commitment, which the agent may or may not endorse" (Floridi 2008, 191). The picture of IE that emerges from this is that various levels of abstraction supplement and sometimes guide and correct other levels of abstraction involved in the unfolding of deliberation as instruments for pursuing our various ends. Since it appropriates to itself everything from the various levels of abstrac tion in addition to embracing insights available from levels of abstraction that merely consider Being as such, IE is supposed to be more information rich and sensitive than the virtue ethics alternative, which is always mired in the personal points of view of the various burgeoning individuals. When we are pressed with concrete cases, however, it becomes apparent that the most abstract level of description either adds no information whatsoever to our deliberations or contributes outright misinformation. The problem of preserving meanings across levels of abstraction is indicated in Nagel's observation, "I don't know what it would mean to wonder whether, sub specie aeternitatis, wanting a chicken salad sandwich was perhaps really preferable as a ground for action to wanting a salami sandwich" (Nagel 1986, 131). Clearly, what matters from one point of view may not matter from another. "It matters a great deal what we ourselves think about our selfhood and our possibilities; what a being who stands apart from our experiences and ways of life thinks seems to © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="13">392 RICHARD VOLKMAN matter little, if at all" (Nussbaum 1995, 121). Floridi has sometimes resisted describing IE in such terms, but it is not clear what else to make of claims that IE requires "a disinterested judgment of the moral situation from an objective perspective" (Floridi 2006, 26). This language of perspective or point of view indicates that a shift from our antecedent standpoint is required in order to see the matter correctly, but it must not be assumed that what one sees from one vantage point can simply be added or extended to other ways of seeing the world. When we abstract away from particular contexts, we should no more suppose we still have a clear idea of what we mean than when we try to sort out the "real" relative merits of chicken salad and salami. These concerns can be illustrated using Floridi's own examples. He describes a case in which a boy passes time by smashing the windshields of junk cars (Floridi 1999). The case stipulates that these windscreens will not be used or even seen by anyone in the future, so there is no question about the boy's actions in relation to utility or the interests of others. According to IE, the boy's actions are rightly condemned as vandalism, and Floridi asserts that this matches our intuitive sense of the case. Since the observa tion that the boy's vandalism is wrong makes sense only on the assumption of the intrinsic right of the windshields to be what they are, that is, only if we assume the principle of ontological equality, Floridi concludes this case is evidence of the value of IE. However, there is much to dispute in this case. First of all, it is hardly obvious that this is a case of wrongful vandalism. The proponent of situated-action ethics will surely claim that our observa tion is tainted by imagined uses of these windscreens or the property rights of whoever owns the junk cars; the virtue ethicist will complain that the story is far too thin to make any adequate judgment. Is the boy really just getting mindless kicks, or is he rehearsing his shot? How much time are we talking about? What are the alternatives open to him? What brought him here, and where is he going? There are myriad coherent stories in which it would be perfectly O.K. to smash things. But the deeper problems with the case are matters of ontology. The description of "vandalism" presupposes that the windscreens are properly described according to some essence or nature that is violated in the act of smashing them. According to ontological equality, their integrity as windshields demands that we not smash them without reason. But it is a profound error to suppose that these things "really are" windshields from the point of view of the universe. The boy treats them as targets. In fact, the story posits that no one will ever treat them as windshields ever again. In that case, why should that description be privileged? Perhaps Floridi means not to privilege that description but merely to treat it as one ontology alongside others. But in that case, there can be no way to respect this entity for what it is and promote its flourishing, since its flourishing under one ontology excludes its flourishing under another. From the point of view that commands us to offer such respect, the thing has no © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="14">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 393 nature and no flourishing. From a point of view such that it has a nature and can flourish as the thing it is, it does not command any particular respect (by hypothesis, it will never fulfill its function as a windscreen), and it may even cry out to be smashed (the flourishing of a target). Perhaps the boy behaves wrongly unless he smashes it! This may sound like an objection Floridi has repeatedly tried to address—that IE either is not a precise or clear guide to action or leads to relativism. However, my point is much deeper: Whatever observations may seem to make sense from the point of view of the universe are irrelevant to the project of a human life. IE can guide action, but it guides us badly by suggesting an equality that does not exist at the relevant level of abstraction. While previous critics of IE have generally admitted IE's impartialism or universality as important values, virtue ethics disagrees on these first premises of the IE project, and that transforms the nature of the critique. For example, Stahl questions IE's claims to universality by noting that one's level of abstraction expresses an ontology and, "as the choice of the LoA [level of abstraction] is not determined and given that it determines ontological commitments, it seems that an agent is free to choose, albeit indirectly, the ontology of a phenomenon. This allows the interpretation that an agent gets to determine which information entities exist (are relevant) and therefore need to be considered in ethical decision making" (2008, 100). On this point, Floridi responds that, although there is no single level of abstraction that is appropriate for all purposes, some levels of abstraction are more or less appropriate for given purposes. Thus, he maintains against Stahl that worries about relativism are misplaced because one's level of abstraction may be more or less appropriate to a task at hand, and the level of abstraction that reveals ontological equality happens to be useful for our ethical purposes. "So, the position held by IE is that, when it comes to talk about ethical issues in an ontocentric and more inclusive, non anthropocentric way, an informational LoA [level of abstraction] does a good job" (Floridi 2008, 190). But this will not do as a response to the concerns raised here. If we are willing to embrace a narrow relativism on this point, then there cannot be an ontocentric way to approach ethical issues that abstracts from the grounds of our discriminating things into the things they are, since what a thing is depends on our actual purposes and values (e.g., is it a target or a windshield), and it is exactly those purposes and values that determine which levels of abstraction are appropriate for any given deliberation. An informational LoA does not permit the discriminations that would ground conduct, since it transcends the actual concerns of situated agents, and it is not clear how anything gleaned from that perspective could provide reasons that must be taken seriously in one's situated delibera tions, since the informational LoA is manifestly not appropriate for solving the problems seen from one's actual perspective. That is, if the appropriateness of a level of abstraction is given by one's purposes, then ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="15">394 RICHARD VOLKMAN the informational LoA is not appropriate, unless one's purposes are exhausted in a concern for ethics in an "ontocentric and more inclusive, non-anthropocentric way." The fact that everything seems to be valuable when I ignore how things differently impact my actual projects and constitutive commitments can only ground a reason to treat all things as having intrinsic value as the things they are if I already have a reason to ignore those distinctions that make them appear as the things they are for me. But indiscriminately ignoring those distinctions would alter my constitutive commitments, which would change who I am, which means IE is not merely supplementing my perspective but really does ask me to abandon my perspective in favor of another. The problem is not mere underdetermination or puzzlement about how to apply IE. In a range of concrete cases, the principle of ontological equality can only lead to misunderstanding one's circumstance. It cannot inform good deliberation. If I am a musician working on a song that includes a banjo track, should I add a bit of distortion to it? Although it is quite literally adding noise to the signal, knowing when to use distortion effects in music is plainly a matter of good construction, and I submit this knowledge is not advanced one bit by considering the effects of distortion on the banjo signal as an object of moral concern. To the contrary, this can only muddle a case that must be handled with a subtle sensitivity to the concrete facts of the case: What is the genre? What is the musical motive of the piece? Who is the audience? How does it all fit within the wider context of my musical tradition? What would distortion on the banjo track mean in this context? A brilliant move in bluegrass can be a mistake in jazz. While there is no formula or simple algorithm for all this, we must emphasize that this analysis does not entail a shallow relativism or subjectivism, and it is not an empty situation ethics. It is wrong to suppose that anything goes in a bluegrass jam. Improvisation is not about rules or policies, but there are mistakes in jazz. Or, alternately, if something is a mistake, then it is not jazz. Either way, there is something to perform well as the thing one is, but it involves the instant processing of vast amounts of varied information along numerous incommensurable dimen sions. We call that sort of information processing perception, and it cannot be advanced by learning about the principle of ontological equality. Notice how all this happily embraces conception in terms of informa tion, but only if we appreciate the concrete narrative that confers meaning on the information entity in question. The banjo signal has no right in itself to be a banjo signal; that right must be earned in virtue of the role it plays in some coherent story. To suppose otherwise obstructs the story telling that makes meaning. For some things, the contour of the story is forced upon us; for others, it is impossible to tell their story without anthropomorphizing and personification. My dog's chew toy sits on the floor. Is it flourishing as the thing it is? Or would it be better if my dog was chewing on it? Does the chew toy flourish as the thing it is by maintaining the integrity of its bone shape into the future, or by being torn to pieces by © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="16">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 395 a dog? In contrast, suppose the Mona Lisa is on my floor. Now, there is no question that I should not permit my dog to chew on it, and there is no question that a sensitive agent will perceive the story of this information entity and what it means to respect its integrity and flourishing without anthropomorphizing or personification. Since there is no narrative center of gravity for the chew toy, it does not merit my respect, and cataloguing its trajectory through time and space is not meaningful. A chronicle is not a history, because it is not a story. But the story of the Mona Lisa centers on itself as a thing in its own right (and not just as the creation of Leonardo). It commands my respect and admiration for this reason, rather than as the birthright of its being as an information object. The importance of coherent storytelling is not meant to deny the reality of information in the absence of the storyteller; it points us to the fact that such information cannot be seen to matter. The information turn pushes us to acknowledge that not all information is equal. Storytelling grounds the meaning and significance of information objects while maintaining priority of the particular. Brey (2008) argues that Floridi's defense of the intrinsic value of all information objects commits what is sometimes called the Birthday Fallacy: Everyone has a birthday; therefore, there must be a single day on which every person was born. As Brey tells it, Floridi (2002) supposes that there must one thing that everything with intrinsic value shares, that there must be a "minim alist and homogenous account" of intrinsic value. Floridi responds that IE attempts to "show in practice a way of conceptualizing Being informationally in such a way as to build a minimalist and homogenous account of all entities" (Floridi 2008, 193). So, the informational LoA reveals a commonality among all information objects that can explain their intrinsic value, and this hypothesis is confirmed by its actual usefulness in theory and practice. However, if a thing's being what it is and having value is relative to the competing stories we can tell about it, then the informational LoA will have left out what makes the thing what it is with whatever value it has. At a minimum, this represents an alternative to the IE explanation of value. Moreover, it indicates how the sources of value may be multifarious and incommensurable; just as stories bear a family resemblance that makes them all stories in the absence of a shared essence, so the values of things will be heterogeneous. The objection to this approach seems to be that it is unabashedly anthropomorphic and relativistic. If one has already accepted that all of ethics needs to be utterly impartial and universal, that will probably seem like a serious objection. However, virtue ethics does not concede that this narrow relativism (which must not be confused with shallow, anything goes subjectivism) is an objection. Rather, our longing for universality and impartiality belongs in politics, not ethics, and respect for the deep pluralism that implies relativism is a condition of constructing the good society, not an obstruction of it. ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="17">396 RICHARD VOLKMAN Sociopoiesis: Justice Means Competition Is Cooperation Some information entities craft their own stories, including the stories that define them. These entities will always merit the respect described above, since they will have some center of narrative gravity thatMs at the same time a narrator and potential interlocutor. As already noted, there are no sharp boundaries between individuals so defined. Our lives quite literally overlap as expanding circles of influence intermingling with others. Sometimes, that intermingling is best conceived as forming an altogether distinct and coherent information entity with a story of its own—a friendship. In other cases, the story is more perspicuous that treats these waves as confronting and competing against one another. It is in these cases that politics and the virtue of justice enjoy their full significance. Most human interactions are neither entirely matters of friendship nor entirely matters of justice. It requires discernment to know which claims demand attention when. Many virtue ethicists have incorrectly supposed that politics involves nothing more than "scaling up" the virtues as applying to society as a whole, and this seems to be Floridi's own conception of the virtue ethics account of the making of society—"sociopoiesis" (Floridi and Sanders 2005). However, this communitarian approach to politics mistakes society for friendship. Insofar as we really are sorting out relations that are not matters of friendship, good construction will not be the making of a single unity. Whose perspective, whose conception of the good, whose story should prevail? There is no outside perspective to answer this, and the resulting competition to impose one's conception of the good rather than being imposed upon is a Hobbesian war of all against all. If we really are in something like a competition, and if each of us really does merit respect, then politics is better understood in terms of a nonaggression pact rather than a universal republic. "The most schematic code against interference and mutual destruction may be enough for parties who merely have a shared requirement to live, not a requirement to share a life" (Williams 1985, 103). As Rawls (2005) has emphasized, liberalism finds its appeal in resolving the fact of "permanent reasonable pluralism." An extended society is not a friendship, club, community, or association. While there are indeed no sharp boundaries between persons as such, there are plainly distinct centers of narrative gravity that have stronger and weaker claims to various regions of moral space. Most of us most of the time recognize the legitimate sovereignty of others over what is their own, but conflict emerges at the unavoidably vague boundaries. Since even persons of perfectly good will are bad judges in their own cases, politics and government is the necessary business of drawing up and enforcing sharp boundaries that define our legitimate expectations with respect to what counts as my life, liberty, and property and what counts as yours.

Liberal rights facilitate market relations that supplement friendships and sup plant competition as combat, and market institutions harness the wisdom of crowds as information-processing technologies of the highest order. "Market institutions" must not be understood in a narrowly economic sense, since they include the distributed processing that constitutes the marketplace of ideas and underwrites progress as the condition of cultural and social evolution. This is the only way to proceed if sociopoiesis matters in the information age of complex and open societies. "It is in the utilization, in the mutually adjusted efforts of different people, of more knowledge than anyone possesses or than it is possible intellectually to synthesize, that achievements emerge that are greater than any one man's mind can foresee" (Hayek 1958, 193). A political order characterized by rule of law and liberal rights embraces impartiality and universalism in their appropriate domain, while establishing the conditions for the emergence of the good society. Within this framework, relativism, which amounts to authority in its original sense with respect to one's own life's story, will not offend against any obvious moral rights or duties. Reverence from the Inside Out Given their willingness to embrace local ontologies in evaluating the meaning and significance of states of affairs and entities, perhaps Floridi and Sanders can welcome the notion that individuals working from within their individual perspectives are best situated to find their way through their individual lives, while IE remains true at a level of abstraction suited to philosophy and as an external confirmation of certain of the insights informed by our personal points of view. However, they may balk at the notion that an understanding of our universe that proceeds from the inside out can do justice to our objective relation to the world. Perhaps they will maintain that there is something just wrong with virtue ethics insofar as it remains so unapologetically anthropocentric and egocentric. Against this, I submit that everything we can appreciate from the perspective of IE can be equally well appreciated without jumping outside our own skins. Virtue ethics is neither narrowly anthropocentric nor selfishly egocentric. As Williams notes, "The word 'speciesism' has been used for an attitude some regard as our ultimate prejudice, that in favor of humanity. It is more revealingly called 'humanism,' and it is not a prejudice. To see the world from a human point of view is not an absurd thing for human beings to do" (1985, 1 18). It must be emphasized, however, that this does not entail a failure to appreciate and respect the myriad claims to value we encounter as our lives unfold in the concrete. "Our app'roach to these issues cannot and should not be narrowly anthropocentric" (Williams ©2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="19">398 RICHARD VOLKMAN 1994, 47). If we remain open to whatever possibilities and arguments we may confront when we start where we are, there is nothing narrowly anthropocentric about starting where we are. Similarly, while every ethical concern has to be addressed to us as a concern of us, it does not follow that every concern is reducible to self-concern. This responds directly to Floridi's defense of ontological equality, which "consists in shifting the burden of proof by asking, from a patient-oriented perspective, whether there is anything in the universe that is intrinsically and positively worthless ethically and hence rightly disrespectable in this partic ular sense, i.e. insofar as its intrinsic value is concerned" (Floridi 2008, 192). If foundationalism is wrongheaded and we are justified in starting where we are, then anthropocentrism is not mere conservatism or prejudice. Nothing is arbitrarily cast aside as worthless, for we do not assume anything that does not appear immediately in the first person, and everything that appears is subject to revision. We expect the value of things to be revealed in the light of a vigorous and open-minded scrutiny of our present concerns, since nothing that fails to speak to these concerns can ground the reasons we actually have as the things we actually are. So, the challenge should be clear enough: For any entity you like, go ahead and set out to show that this entity commands my respect by appealing to the particular projects and constitutive commit ments that define my character in the story of my life. I am in no way denying that you may be able to do that for any entity you choose. What I am denying is that any one account can do this all at once for everything and everyone. Reverence has to be worked up from the inside out. It is significant that Emerson and the American Transcendentalists stand at once as early advocates for reverence as due unto Nature and as the great champions of the heroic individualism that evaluates the world from the inside out. These are not mutually exclusive projects. Mere things are the appropriate occasion to reflect on what is highest, and that will entail the affirmation of life itself. "The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible" (Emerson 1982b, 37). For the poet or the philosopher, or better yet, for the heroic individual who aspires to be both, contemplation of Nature is the very stuff of religious experience. "We can never see Christianity from the catechism:—from the pastures, from a boat in the pond, from amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly may" (Emerson 1982a, 232-33). It is not surprising that this attitude seems at odds with conceiving one's self as an individual apart from Nature. Indeed, standing before Nature tends to the dissolution of the individual consciousness, but this is where the real greatness of what it means to be a human individual is revealed: "Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God" (Emerson 1982b, 39). In this light, the integrity and self-reliance of the individual are expressions of reverence, for "God will not have His work © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="20">WHY INFORMATION ETHICS MUST BEGIN WITH VIRTUE ETHICS 399 made manifest by cowards" (Emerson 1982c, 176). Far from disproving one's individual greatness, our encounters with Nature underline and confirm the heroism implicit in becoming who we are. "The hero always bears the wilderness and the sacred, inviolable borderline within him wherever he may go" (Nietzsche, qtd. Thiele 1990, 21). Seen in this light, it becomes apparent that Floridi and Sanders are wrong to accuse the ethical individualist thread of virtue ethics of "moral escapism" (Floridi and Sanders 2005, 198). To the contrary, as Nietzsche emphasizes, it is the craven desire to escape the burden of finding our way in the concrete and messy and terrifying business of the real world that drives the philosopher to invent abstract portraits of the "one true world" that sets a standard for life as against life (Nietzsche 1959). Our station is instead to affirm life, to achieve the greatness appropriate to us. By starting where we are in the concrete, this project assumes the hardest and greatest respon sibility of creation and attention. "The salient difference between acting from a script and improvising is that one has to be not less but far more keenly attentive to what is given by the other actors and by the situation" (Nussbaum 1990, 94). This task of creation unfolds from the inside out, while embracing what is good and beautiful and true throughout the whole unfolding of the universe. And that is the ultimate promise of virtue ethics in its contemplation of Nature: "We learn that man has access to the entire mind of the Creator, is himself the creator in the finite. This view, which admonishes me where the sources of wisdom and power lie, and points to virtue as to 'The golden key; Which opes the palace of eternity,' carries upon its face the highest certificate of truth, because it animates me to create my own world through the purification of my soul" (Emerson 1982b, 73). The point of view of the universe may be suitable for a God or a beast, but not for a man, and we must not set before ourselves the project of abandoning our posts in a vain wish to be other than we are, for everything that matters that can be affirmed from the point of view of the universe can be equally seen and better appreciated from the point of view of the great soul.
