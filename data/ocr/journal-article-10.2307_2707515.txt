<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE IN CHINA AND THE WEST (II) BY JOSEPH NEEDHAM, F.R.S. II. CHINESE CIVILIZATION AND THE LAWS OF NATURE 6. Chinese Thought and the Laws of Nature The fundamental ideas of Chinese scientific thought, running through all the ancient and medieval philosophical schools, were the long-enduring theories of the Yin and Yang and the Five Elements. The Taoist thinkers, profound and inspired though they were, failed, perhaps because of their intense mistrust of the powers of reason and logic, to develop anything resembling the idea of Laws of Nature. With their appreciation of relativism and of the subtlety and im- mensity of the universe, they were groping after an Einsteinian world- picture, without having laid the foundations for a Newtonian one. By that path science could not develop. It was not that the Tao [185], the cosmic order in all things, did not work in some way accord- ing to measure and rule, but the tendency of the Taoists was to regard it as inscrutable for the theoretical intellect. It would perhaps not be going too far to say that this was the reason why, when to them was consigned the care of Chinese science through the centuries, that science had to remain on a purely empirical level. Moreover it is not irrelevant that their social ideals had less use than those of any other school for positive law; seeking to go back to primitive tribal collec- tivism, where nothing was formulated and written down, but every- thing worked well in communal co-operativeness, they could not have been interested in the abstract law of any lawgivers. The Mohists, on the other hand, or rather the late Mohists, together with the Logicians, strove mightily to perfect logical proc- esses, and made the beginnings of applying them to zoological classifi- cation and to the elements of mechanics and optics. We do not know why this scientific movement failed; perhaps it was because the Mohists' interest in Nature was too strongly bound up with their practical aims in military technology. At any rate, these schools had no survivors after the upheavals of the first unification of the empire. They seem to have approached no nearer than the Taoists to the idea of laws of Nature. They used fa [67] as a technical term (identical with "law " as used by the Legalists) in the logical parts of the Mo 194</page><page sequence="2">3g 2$-# 7^P 687ct z,1B^. 2T,|^- ^Ni~fX 44'M I q 3z It 5* 71LV It+ 717 78 '71 O3 J0 /1 * 4 o tti 7AT 7 h' er sape in ua bake ine txt PaXe L 7 401 3a4t 4S0J S ^f &lt; g? 53XA el 3/+^ 43 A7? s -3F 4? 7Th 3squ 77h . a7e8 7I It^tl^?67 qzMl tiAjhZ 13fut8^ ff3 ; ^, 77 A / ham.

The Words Fa and Li With the Legalists (Fa Chia) and Confucians we are in the realm of pure sociological interest, for neither of these schools had any curi- osity about Nature outside and surrounding man. As we have seen, the Legalists laid all their emphasis on positive law (fa [67]), which was to be the pure will of the lawgiver, irrespective of the generally accepted morality, and capable of being quite contrary to it if the welfare of the State should so require. But the law of the Legalists was at any rate precisely and abstractly formulated. As against this the Confucians (Ju Chia) adhered to the body of ancient custom, usage and ceremonial, which included all those practices, such as filial piety, which unnumbered generations of the Chinese people had instinctively felt to be right-this was li [66b], and we may equate it with natural law.107 Moreover it was necessary that this right behavior be taught, rather than enforced, by paternalistic magistrates. Confucius had said 108 that if the people were given laws and leveled by punishments, they would try to avoid the punishments but have no sense of shame; but that if they were " led by virtue " they would spontaneously avoid disputes and crimes. The Li Chi [68] (Record of Rites) 109 speaks, in symbolism appropriately taken from hydraulic engineering, of good customs as dykes or embankments, saying that while it is easy to know what has already happened it is difficult to know what is going to happen. Good custom, therefore, more flexible than formulated laws, prevents disturbances before they arise, while laws can only operate after they have arisen. Hence one can under- stand the point of view which after the victory of the Confucians over the Legalists came to dominate Chinese thinking, that since correct 106 It is part of the argument of this Section that the term fa [67] was never applied in the sense of the Laws of Nature until quite recent times. Matthews' dictionary gives, it is true, a translation of the expression pan fa [69] (M/4886) as "laws of planetary motion." I think that this must be due to a mistranslation of certain passages in Kuan Tzu [70], chs. 7 and 66. The Tzu Yuan and other Chi- nese dictionaries knew nothing of such a meaning, explaining the phrase as the selection of important rules of laws and carving them on boards. 107I note that this identification is expressly approved by modern Chinese jurists such as Hsiao Ching-Fang (cf. his Les conceptions fondamentales du droit public dans la Chine ancienne [Paris, 1940], 66). 108 Lun Yi, II, iii. 19 Legge, The Texts of Confucianism, Pt. II, the Li Ki (Li Chi) (2 vols., Oxford, 1885, repr. 1926), II, 284.</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 199 behavior in accordance with li [71] always depends on the circum- stances, such as the status of the acting parties in social relationships, to publish laws beforehand which could take insufficient account of the complexity of concrete circumstances is an absurdity. Hence the severe restriction, which we have already noted, of codified law to purely criminal provisions.110 While it is convenient throughout this argument to draw the con- trast between fa [72] and li [71], it is probable that the earliest form of this distinction was between fa [72] and i [73], a term which is generally translated " justice," i.e., that which seems to be justice to the natural man. Innumerable passages could be quoted to show this. Perhaps the locus classicus is the final section of the Ta Hsueh [198] (Great Learning), where it is said: " On the national scale, gain is not (real) gain; justice is gain (tzhu wei kuo, pu i li wei li, i i wei li) [74].11 Another important place is Hsiin Tzu [74a], ch. 16, where there is a long discussion of i [73] in contrast to fa [72].112 The Wen Tzu [74b] book links the two well together by saying: 113 "Laws (should) arise out of the people, and should correspond with human- heartedness " (fa seng yu i, i seng yu chung, shih ho hu jen hsin [75]). At an earlier page we had occasion to note the growth of a set of ideas which may be termed the " phenomenalism " of the Confucians of the Han dynasty, though its roots are a good deal older. This was the conviction that ethical irregularities of men in general, or ritual irregularities of the emperor and his bureaucrats, would infallibly bring about natural calamities of many kinds. In his great work From Religion to Philosophy, Cornford noted a similar, though less elaborated, conviction among the Greeks (as in Hesiod, Aeschines, Sophocles, Herodotus, etc.), and this indeed was almost the point from which he set out on his exploration of the Greek ideas of destiny and Nature. It has been defined as the conviction of the unity of the ethical and the cosmic order. If it would not be to caricature the 110 See the excellent chapter " Custom and Law in the Universal Empire " (of China) in H. Wilhelm, Gesellschaft und Staat in China (Peiping, 1944), 65 ff. The law was not intended to protect property or persons, but only good customs between persons. 111 E. R.

Forke, Geschichte d. alten chinesischen Philosophie (Ham- burg, 1927), 352.</page><page sequence="7">200 JOSEPH NEEDHAM views of Cornford by undue brevity, one might perhaps say that he came to the very plausible conclusion that this hypostatization of the moral order was a kind of projection of the internal relationships of primitive tribal collectivism on to external Nature,114 with which human society was felt as continuous. He drew attention to a striking remark of Iamblichus: 115 Themis in the realms of Zeus, and Dike in the world below, hold the same place and rank as Nomos in the cities of men; so that he who does not justly perform his appointed duty may appear as a violator of the whole order of the universe. But if in European thought these ideas were important tributaries of the stream which appears in the third and second centuries B.C. as the Koinos Nomos, the Universal Law, of the Stoics, we do not find in China that they embodied or stimulated at any time the conception of Laws of Nature. We saw, indeed, that those who, like Wang Chhung [151] in the first century, advocated most strongly the world- view of scientific naturalism, were intensely opposed to the basic belief, as well as to the extravagances, of the phenomenalists, attack- ing them on the essentially Copernican ground that their anthropo- centrism was nonsense. In the attempt to visualize what phenome- nalism meant to the ancient Chinese, Eberhard11l has made the interesting suggestion that they thought of Heaven and Earth as if the sequences of their phenomena proceeded along two parallel strands in time, as if in two parallel wires, and that perturbations of one sequence affected the other as if by a kind of induction process. Presumably in Europe there were factors, perhaps theological, and very likely of Hebrew and Babylonian origin, which made it possible to reject anthropocentric phenomenalism while retaining and expand- ing the notion of universal law. But in China these were lacking. One of the strangest features about this conviction of the great unity of heaven and earth, which Franke 117 has so well emphasized, is that while the Chinese law could not be said to be in non-human Nature, there are a number of statements that the laws of human society were, or should be, modelled on non-human Nature. Doubt- less the best-known statement of this is in the Chung Yung [133] 114 Cf. p. 55. 115 Vit. Pythag., IX, 46. 116 " Beitrage zur kosmologischen Spekulation Chinas in der Han-Zeit," Baessler Archiv, 16 (1933), 1. 117 " Der kosmische Gedanke in Philosophie und Staat d. Chinesen," Vortrage d. Bibliothek Warburg (1928), 1.</page><page sequence="8">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 201 (Doctrine of the Mean),118 where it is said of Confucius that he handed on the traditions of the ancient sage-kings. From above they took [as a model for the] laws, the seasonal [motions of the] Heavens. Below they followed the waters and the earth (shang lii thien shih, hsia hsi shui thu [76]). (tr. Hughes, Legge, modified). One presumes that they did so on account of the regularity of the heavens, the persistence of the waters, and the firmness of the earth. The same applies to a similar striking statement in the opening para- graph of the 66th chapter of Kuan Tzu, where the instruments of peace and war are compared with the warmth and cold of Nature. The only obvious conclusion is that we have here a poetical or meta- phorical derivation of human laws, the qualities of which were thought of as mirroring certain desirable qualities seen in non-human Nature; but the paradox remains that it should never have occurred to anyone as odd that Law could be derived from where no Law existed. 7. The Word Lii Throughout this paper I have had to make what I fear may be a wearisome insistence upon the distinction between li [77] and fa [78]. Neither of these words was easily applicable to non-human Nature. But we have just come upon one ancient Chinese word which does seem to link the spheres of non-human phenomena and human law. This word is lii [79]. We have often met with it in the paragraphs on the development of Chinese legal codes (Sect. 2, Part I above), where, with its usual dictionary meaning, it stands for " statutes " and " regulations." This sense is undoubtedly quite old, as the phrase in Kuan Tzu may witness; " the laws serve to distinguish each person's portion and place, and to put a stop to quarrels " (lii che so ting, fen chih cheng yeh [80]).119 Here the idea is very close to that of moira and the other Greek entities discussed by Cornford. But the word had also a quite different meaning, namely the series of standard bamboo pitch-pipes used in ancient music and acoustics, and the twelve semitones which these pipes represented. What could have been the connection between the laws of sound, and the laws of human lawgivers? 118 Ch. 30 (tr. Legge, The Chinese Classics, etc., I, 291; Hughes, op. cit., 139; neither translation seems quite to do justice to the text). 119 Another passage is in Tso Chuan, Duke Hsuan, 12th year; Couvreur, Tch'ouen Ts'iou et Tso Tchouan; texte chinois avec traduction francaise (3 vols., Hochienfu, 1914), I, 617.</page><page sequence="9">202 JOSEPH NEEDHAM The word lii [79] (K/502) has as its right-hand phonetic a sign which was certainly in the most ancient times a hand holding a writing implement, and for its radical the word chhih [81], which meant a step with the left foot (paralleling chhe [82], a step with the right foot). This suggests an original connection with the notation of a ritual dance. Later on, since the twelve semitones were made to correspond with the months of the year, the word came to mean a calendrical date, and thus is found associated with the word li [83] in titles of chapters on calendrical science, such as the Lii Li Chih [84] of the Chhien Han Shu (History of the Former Han). Details about the standard pitch-pipes will be found in works on Chinese music.120 The question at issue is how the conception of laws, statutes or regu- lations, can have been derived from, or even associated with, the word for the standard musical tones. Perhaps the etymological considerations just mentioned hold one clue. It would not be so far a step from the directions for music and ritual dancing laid down by a diviner or priest-magician (indeed a shamanistic wu [85]) to the directions for conduct or other behavior, especially organized military behavior, laid down by a temporal ruler. There was a logical analogy between what dancing would do against the spirits, and what drilling and weapon-practicing would do against human enemies.121 Some kinds of dances certainly involved the carrying and brandishing of weapons.122 It is thought that originally there were five stations around the dancing-floor which in time gave their names to a certain quality of sound, according to the instrument 120 Cf. J. H. Levis, Foundations of Chinese Musical Art (Peiping, 1936), 63; E. Chavannes, Les memoires historiques de Se-Ma Ts'ian (transl. of the Shih Chi [in part] of Ssuma Chhien) (Paris, 1895-1905; photographically reproduced, Shanghai, 1945, 5 vols.), III, (2), 630 ff.; G. Soulie de Morant, La musique en Chine (Paris, 1911), 12; K. Robinson, A Critical Study of Ju Dzai-Yii's (Chu Tsai-Yii's) Account of the System of the Lii Lii or Twelve Musical Tubes in Ancient China (Oxford, 1948). 121 We have many traces of this in our own culture, for example the many ceremonial dances in which swords are used, either for imitating combat (the " pyrrhic " type) or first held hilt-and-point by a row or ring of dancers and finally locked round the head of a victim (the "sacrificial " type). Compare the Greek dance of the Kuretes, and the Roman Salii. For the traditions which have per- sisted until our own time, see D. Kennedy, England's Dances (London, 1949) (em- bodying the conclusions of J. Needham, " The Geographical Distribution of English Ceremonial Folk Dances," Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, III [1936], 1). 122 M.

Many references exist in Chou books (the Tso Chuan, the Shang Chiin Shu, etc.), to the use of drums in battle as the signal for advance, and of the beating of suspended slabs of metal (predecessors of gongs) as the signal for retreat. But besides this, it seems that the pitch-pipes themselves were taken into battle, or at least to the field headquarters of the commander. Granet 124 has drawn attention to passages in the Chou Li (Record of the Rites of Chou) which deal with the duties of the Great Annalist (Ta Shih [86]) and the Great Instructor (Ta Shih [87]). It is said of the latter: 125 When the army is assembled (and marches forth), he takes the standard pitch-pipe tubes in order to determine the " note " of the army, and thus to announce its good or evil fortune. (tr. auct.) And of the former: 126 When the army is assembled (and marches forth), he takes with him the Times of Heaven [the commentator says that this means that he takes care of the shih [88] or diviner's board, in order to ascertain the time of heaven- Ta Shih pao shih i chih thien shih [89]].127 And he rides in the same chariot as the Great Instructor (Ta Shih [87]). (tr. auct.) The standard tubes and the diviner's board were thus important instruments which travelled in the same chariot under the care of two high officials. Were it not for the fact that the pipes must have been very difficult to blow, and that their flute-like notes could have carried only a short distance, it would be tempting to believe that they formed a more elaborate code of signals than the drum and the gong. But they must rather have been used for divination, since the com- mentator quotes, after the first of the above passages, some sentences from a lost military work, the Ping Shu [90], describing the blowing of the pitch-pipes as a method of divination at headquarters in order to learn what success the combat units were having and what heart they were in.128 123 K. Robinson (pers. comm.). The different notes were certainly associated with different dances, as we know from the description of the department of the Master of Music (Ta Ssu Yo [85a]) in the Chou Li (ch. 6, 2a if.; Biot, Le Tcheou-Li, ou rites des Tcheou [3 vols., Paris, 1851; Peiping, 1930], II, 29 ff.). 124 La pensee chinoise (Paris, 1934), 209. 125 Ch. 6, 14a; Biot, op. cit., II, 51. 126 Ch. 6, 42b; Biot, op. cit., II, 108. 127 This is a most interesting mention of the ancestor of the magnetic compass (cf. pp. 27, 28 in Part I). 128 Biot, op. cit., 51.</page><page sequence="11">204 JOSEPH NEEDHAM A general connection is nevertheless obvious between the musical notes on the one hand, and the directions for ritual dancing and for military activity on the other. But there is nothing here which sug- gests that the Chinese ever thought of the semitone intervals of the standard pitch-pipes as originating from, or constituting, any kind of law in the non-human phenomenal world. The fact that what we now regard as a branch of physics stood at the origin of a word which took on the-sense of human legal regulations, may have several proba- ble explanations, and does not, in short, mean that Chinese thinking therefore contained the elements of the conception of Laws of Nature. 8. The Word tu If, at this stage, a reader should happen to glance at the astro- nomical chapter of the Shih Chi (Historical Records), written about 90 B.C., he might well come upon the following passage: 129 As for me [Ssuma Chhien refers to himself], I have studied the memoirs of the historians, and have examined the movements [of the heavenly bodies]. During the past hundred years it has never happened that the five planets have made their appearances without [from time to time] moving backwards, and when they move backwards they are at the full and change their colors. And moreover there are definite times when the sun and moon are veiled or eclipsed, and when they move to the north or the south. These are general laws. In the light of the whole discussion of this Section, he will then turn to the Chinese text fairly certain that whatever Ssuma Chhien actu- ally said, he did not speak of general laws in the sense of the scientific laws of Nature. Now the actual expression he used is tu [91]; (tzhu chhi ta tu yeh [92]) and this word therefore demands notice. The primary meaning of tu [91] is " degree of measurement," and that this is overwhelmingly its commonest use appears not only from the lexicographers but also from the indexes or concordances which have been made for many of the most important ancient Chinese books. Its etymology, such as might be deduced from oracle-bone forms (K/801), does not throw any light on how it came to mean this. Nevertheless, its significance may be that of "law," especially when it is found in combinations such as chih tu [93], " government tu," or fa tu [94], " legal tu." Couvreur 130 gives examples of these 129 Ch. 27, 137. (Tr. Chavannes, op. cit., III, 409; eng. auct.). 130Dictionnaire classique de la langue chinoise (Hsienhsien, 1890; Peiping, 1947).</page><page sequence="12">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 205 uses from the I Ching (Book of Changes) where the former combina- tion occurs, and from the Shu Ching (Historical Classic) 131 where tu [91] occurs alone in the sense that certain people had " gone beyond the bounds " or " transgressed." 132 There is of course a close semantic connection between "law " and "measure," for every law has a cer- tain quantitative aspect: " how far," we say, " is it true that such-and- such an action comes under the scope of such-and-such a provision of the law "-" measures must be taken, by means of bye-laws, to curb such-and-such a practice which is growing up." But this quanti- tative aspect tends to remain metaphorical until legislators set out to make positive law, independent of morality, as, for instance, when a Chhin Shih Huang Ti begins to regulate the gauge of chariot-wheels. Still, there are to be found among the writings of the philosophers of the Warring States period numerous analogies between law in human societies and the carpenter's square, the compasses and the plumb- line. More important is the fact, pointed out by Couvreur,133 that tu [95] may be considered a definite technical term for the movements of the heavenly bodies. The word was used throughout Chinese his- tory for the 365 degrees into which the celestial sphere was divided, and for many other scales of divisions, such as the hundred parts of a day or night as shown by the clepsydra (water-clock). Revealing is the phrase used by Tung Chung-Shu in his Chhun Chhiu Fan Lu 134 of about the same time as Ssuma Chhien, where he says " Thien Tao yu tu" [96]; the Tao [114] of Heaven has its regular measured movements. The general conclusion to which we must come is that on the strictest standards of the philosophy of science Chavannes was not justified in translating the word tu [95], standing alone, as " general laws." It would have been preferable to say: " These phe- nomena all have their regular measured (or measurable) recurrent movements." One wishes that it were possible to ask of Ssuma Chhien the ques- tion, in using the word tu [95], measured degrees, did you mean it to have the undertone of " law "? If so, whose law? I believe that it is exceedingly unlikely that he would reply "The laws of Shang Ti" (the ruler above); and almost certain that he would say it was " tzu- 131 Ch. 14. 132 J.

The Words Chi Kang Still keeping within the realm of ancient Chinese astronomical thought, there is to be found, in an obscure fragment of early date, a discussion very much to our purpose. This is the so-called Chi Ni Tzu [99], contained in the famous collection of fragments made by Ma Kuo-Han. We do not even know whether Chi Ni Tzu was a real person, or simply a character invented by whoever it was who wrote the Chi Jan [100] chapters or book attributed to Fan Li [101]. Fan Li himself was a historical person, a statesman of the southern State of Yueh in the fifth century B.C.,135 but from the internal evidence, the discussions which Chi Ni Tzu, Chi Yen [102], carried on with King Kou Chien [103] of Yueh [104] can hardly have been written before the time of Tsou Yen (late fourth century B.C.).136 There seems indeed no reason why part at least of these chapters should not be a Han fabrication, but it must be admitted that they contain rather archaic material, such as the names of the gods of the five elements, and in view of their origin they may perhaps be placed in the late fourth or early third centuries B.C. and considered to embody a southern tradition of naturalism. In any case their exact date and provenance does not in the least affect the present argument. In the Nei Ching [105] chapter 137 we find the following: The King of Yueh said " Since you discuss human affairs so brilliantly, perhaps you can tell me whether natural phenomena (wu [105a]) have dia- bolical or auspicious meanings (in relation to man)? " Chi Ni answered: "There are the Yin and the Yang. All things have their chi kang [105b] [i.e., their fixed positions and motions with regard to other things in the web of Nature's relationships]. The sun, moon and stars signify punishment or virtue, and their changes indicate fortune and mis- fortune. Metal, wood, water, fire and earth conquer each other succes- sively; the moon waxes and wanes alternately. Yet these normal (changes) have no ruler and governor (mo chu chhi chhang [106]). If you follow it [Heaven's Way] virtue will be attained; if you violate it there will be mis- fortune.... 138 All affairs must be managed following the source of Heaven 135 We have met with him in other connections. 16 Ssuma Chhien knows nothing of Chi Ni Tzu, but the Wu Yueh Chhun Chhiu does (Forke, op. cit., 500). Tradition would make him the teacher of Fan Li. But what he is made to say here about the Yin and Yang and the five elements can hardly be earlier than Tsou Yen's time. 137 Ch. 1, 4b. 138 One sentence omitted as incomprehensible.</page><page sequence="14">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 207 and Earth and the Four Seasons with reference to the Yin and Yang. If these principles are not carefully used, State affairs will get into trouble. Man when born does not know the day of his death. If you want to change the normality of Heaven and Earth you will simply unleash mischief, fall into poverty and shorten your life. Thus the sage rejects bribes and obtains a (good) response, but the mass of foolish men strive after wealth and honour (at all costs), not knowing what direction they should take." The King said: " Excellent." (tr. auct.) Here it would have been easy for the unwary to translate chi kang [105b] as Laws of Nature. Forke139 wisely used the words "be- stimmte Wandlungen," fixed changes. Yet the lexicographers admit the meaning of (human) laws for this expression.140 It is obvious that we have to deal here with an analogy from textiles; both words have the silk radical (Rad. 120). Chi [107] combines " silk " with " self," it comes from an uncertain bone graph (K/953, i) and means "to disentangle silk threads one from the other, to put in order, to regulate, rule, law, norm, regular series, cycle of years, conjunction of the sun and moon, inscribed annals." We know that the cycle of years in question is the Jupiter cycle, and significantly Chi Ni Tzu speaks about this, giving it as twelve years, elsewhere in the fragment. Kang [108] combines " silk " with " net" and the ancient graph shows for the phonetic a net and a man (K/697, a, c, e; cf. also K/6744, b). From its original meaning of the cord forming the selvedge of a net, it came to mean "rule, regulate, dis- pose, put in order, direct," especially when used with chi [107].141 The analogous word wang [109] (K/742, 1, a'), though restricted more closely to the meaning of "net," came to imply punishments, and hence law, perhaps because of its analogical use in ch. 73 of the Tao Te Ching [110].142 On the basis of these undertones the trans- lation of the expression chi kang [105b] in the above quotation is adopted. It is striking that a number of the interpretations of the words in question imply an active verb, to disentangle, to set in order, to rule, to make (?) laws. But Chi Ni Tzu very kindly relieves us from the anxiety as to whether the idea of a "disentangler " or lawgiver was at the back of his mind, by saying in an immediately following sentence that these normal motions in the universe have no Master or Governor. This express denial seems to exclude the idea of a Setter 139 Op. cit. 140 Couvreur, op. cit., cites Shih Ching [111] and Shih Chi for this. 141 Couvreur cites Shih Ching [111] (Ta Ya). 142 " Heaven's net is wide, it lets nothing slip through."</page><page sequence="15">208 JOSEPH NEEDHAM in Motion. It is the first time that we have met with it, but it will not be the last. Moreover, the conception of a net is close to that of a vast pattern. There is a web of relationships throughout the universe, the nodes of which are things and events. Nobody wove it, but if you interfere with its texture, you do so at your peril. In the following pages we shall be able to trace the later developments of this web woven by no weaver, this Universal Pattern, until we reach, with the Chinese, something approaching a developed philosophy of organism. 10. The Words Li and Tse So far, then, we have not found in Chinese thought any clear evi- dence of the idea of law in the sense of the natural sciences. Still keeping to the schools which considered themselves Confucian, we must turn to the Neo-Confucians of the Sung dynasty (twelfth cen- tury A.D.). Chu Hsi and the other thinkers of this group made a great effort to bring all Nature and Man into one philosophical sys- tem, and the principal concepts with which they worked were Li [112] and Chhi [113]. The latter corresponded approximately to matter, or rather to matter and energy, and the former was not far removed from the Taoist conception of the Tao [114] as the Order of Nature, though the Neo-Confucians also used the term tao [114] in a slightly different and technical sense. Li [112] could be described as the ordering and organizing principle in the cosmos. For this word Bruce, Henke, Warren, and more recently Bodde all adopted the translation " law," 143 but in my judgment they were not well justified in doing so, and in view of the great confusion which it is liable to cause, this reading should be given up.144 143 J. P. Bruce, The Philosophy of Human Nature, translated from the Chinese with notes (London, 1922) and Chu Hsi and his Masters (London, 1923); F. G. Henke, The Philosophy of Wang Yang-Ming (Chicago, 1916); G. G. Warren, "Was Chu Hsi a Materialist?" Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. (North China Br.), 55 (1924), 28; D. Bodde, " The Philosophy of Chu Hsi," Harv. Journ. Asiat. Stud., 7 (1942), 1, and "The Rise of Neo-Confucianism and its Borrowings from Buddhism and Tao- ism," ibid., 89. 144 After I had come to this conclusion I found that it has the strong support of Forke (Geschichte d. neueren chinesischen Philosophie [Hamburg, 1938]), who writes (p. 384): "Der Begriff des Naturgesetzes ist der chinesischen Denkart fremd." Cf. 171, where he says: "Li ist das rationale Prinzip im Gegensatz zum materiellen, die Vernunft, welche den stoff schafft und beherrscht." On this view the Neo-Confucian position was analogous to that of Giordano Bruno, who never spoke of " law " but always of " reason" (ratio, raggione) as the inherent natures</page><page sequence="16">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 209 The word Li [112] (K/978), in its most ancient meaning, signified the pattern in things, the markings in jade or the fibres in muscle; as a verb it meant to cut things according to their natural grain or divisions. Thence it acquired the common dictionary meaning, "principle." It undoubtedly always conserved the undertone of " pattern," and Chu Hsi himself confirms this, saying: 145 Li [112] is like a piece of thread with its strands, or like this bamboo basket. Pointing to its rows of bamboo strips, the philosopher said, One strip goes this way; and pointing to another strip, Another strip goes that way. It is also like the grain in the bamboo-on the straight it is of one kind, and on the transverse it is of another kind. So also the mind possesses numerous principles (li [112]). Li, then, is rather the order and pattern in Nature, not formulated Law. But it is not pattern thought of as something dead, like a mosaic; it is dynamic pattern as embodied in all living things, and in human relationships and in the highest human values. Such dynamic pattern can only be expressed by the term " organism," and indeed I suggest that Neo-Confucian philosophy was in fact a scheme of thought striving to be a philosophy of organism. We must nevertheless carefully examine the grounds on which Bruce identified Li [112] with universal Law. It will introduce us to another word which we have not yet met in this connection, neither fa [115] nor li [116], neither Li [112] nor lii [117]. In the opening paragraph of the 42nd chapter of the Chu Tzu Chhiian Shu [118] (Collected Writings of Chu Hsi), there is the following dialogue: 146 Question: In distinguishing between the four items Heaven (thien [119]), Fate (ming [120]), the Nature (hsing [121]), and Li [112], would it be cor- rect to speak as follows? In the term Heaven, the reference is to its spon- taneous naturalness (tzu jan [121a]). In the term Fate, the reference is to its flowing and pervading the universe, and being present in all things. In the term, the Nature, the reference is to that complete substance which any specific thing must have before it can come into being. In the term Li, the reference is to the fact that every event and thing has each its own rule of existence (shih shih wu wu ko yu chhi tse [122]). And taking them all together, may it not be said that Heaven [i.e., the natural universe as a of all things, which make them behave as they do (Dorothea Singer, pers. comm.). But I am not satisfied that Vernunft or Reason is an adequate translation for Li [112]. 145 Chu Tzu Chhiian Shu, ch. 46, 12b. (Tr. Bruce, The Philosophy of Human Nature, 290.) 146 P. la, b. (Tr. auct., adjuv. Bruce, op. cit., 3.)</page><page sequence="17">210 JOSEPH NEEDHAM whole] is Li [123], that Fate is in fact the Nature [i.e.; the constitution of a thing or a man], and that the Nature is in fact Li [123])? Is this not correct? Answer: You are right. But people say today that Heaven has no refer- ence to the material heavens, whereas in my view this cannot be left out of account. The philosopher continued: Li [123] is Heaven's substance (thien chih thi [124]), Fate is the operation of Li [123] (li chih yung [125]), the Nature is what man receives, and the Emotions are the Nature in operation. The operative word here is evidently tse [126], which has been trans- lated "rules of existence." There can be little doubt that Chu Hsi's interlocutor had in mind a famous passage in the Shih Ching [111] (Book of Odes),147 thus translated by Legge: 148 Heaven, in giving birth to the multitude of the people, To every faculty and relationship annexed its law (yu wu yu tse [127]) The people possess this normal nature (ping i [128]) And [consequently] love its normal virtue (hao shih i t6 [120]). This verse was quoted by Mencius,149 and is referred to again, by Chu Hsi himself, at a later place in the same ch. 42,150 where he gives his opinion, speaking of human desires, that likes and dislikes themselves are the "things," i.e., Legge's "faculty and relationship," while to like that which is good and to dislike that which is evil, is the " rules of existence " (Legge's " law ") (tse [126]). In other words, though the psychological context introduces unnecessary complexity, we have to deal with neutral natural phenomena or properties on the one hand, and their regular tendency to behave in a certain specific manner on the other. There is no doubt that we are here once again in the no-man's- land between scientific law (" Laws of Nature ") and juridical law, indeed natural law in the legal sense; or rather we are back again in those shadowy regions where the concepts are in a highly undifferenti- ated state. A discovery of great interest is reserved for us, therefore, when we take a look at the etymology of the word tse [126] (K/906), for we find that the ancient writing of the character on bones and bronzes shows a cauldron and a knife-in other words the very act of incising codes of laws on ritual cauldrons, as described in the two passages quoted for the sixth century B.C. at the beginning of this Section. The character's radical should have continued to be that for 147 III, iii, 6. 148 The Texts of Confucianism Translated (Oxford, 1879), 541. 149 Menq Tzu [130], VII, (1), vi.8 (Legge, The Chinese Classics, etc., Vol. II, The Works of Mencius [Hongkong, London, 1861], 279). 15o Ch. 42, 24b.</page><page sequence="18">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 211 cauldron (Rad. 206) but it became corrupted into that for cowry-shell (Rad. 154). It therefore becomes of importance to follow the for- tunes of this word throughout the development of Chinese thinking. Everyone who reads Chinese at all is familiar with it in its common meaning as a consequential particle, " so," "then," "in that case," but it has conserved to this day a variety of secondary usages con- nected with laws and regulations, e.g., the expressions chhang tse [131] unvarying laws; or shui tse [132], a Customs tariff. The use of it in legal-administrative connections seems much commoner in ancient writings than in any " scientific " sense. Thus in the Chung Yung [133] we have "his words will be a rule for the empire " (yen erh shih wei thien hsia tse [134]); in the Li Chi there are nei tse [135], i.e., domestic rules (Oeconomica); the Chou Li has "he governs the cantons and districts by means of the eight regulations" (i pa tse chih tu pi [136]).151 Nearer to what we are looking for is another passage in the Shih Ching, which speaks of " obeying the laws of the Ruler Above " (hsiin Ti chih tse [137]), but this is again of human behavior. The most significant text is that of the I Ching [137a], which under the "wan yen" [138] explanation of the first kua Chhien [139], has the words: 152 When Chhien and Yuan appear in all nine, one can see the laws of Heaven (nai chien thien tse [140]). R. Wilhelm 153 duly wrote " so erblickt man das Gesetz des Himmels" and passed on apparently unaware of the interest of the passage. If this were all that could be adduced in support of the interpre- tation of Bruce (and it is a good deal more than the evidence he him- self gave) the identification of Chu Hsi's Li [141] with the tse [142] of the Odes would not be very convincing. But even if we must ulti- mately part company with Bruce and Bodde, the great interest of the subject calls for investigation of any text which could throw light on the scientific use of the word tse [142], and there is indeed more to be found. In the works of the scholar-poet Chhii Yuan [143] (332 to 295 B.C.) (G/503) there is an astronomical poem, the Thien Wen [144] (Questions about Heaven) in which occur the words " huan tse chiu chhung, shu ying tu chih " [145], which may be translated "As to the circular rule of the Nine Storeys (or layers) of Heaven,154 who can attain to the measurement of it? " Unfortunately it is not quite clear whether the word tse [142] is here used in its consequential 151 I cite these usages on the authority of Couvreur. 152 Ching shang, 7b. 153 I Ging (I Ching): Das Buch der Wandlungen (2 vols.; Jena, 1924), III, 12. 154 Diagram in Chhen Wen-Thao, 38.</page><page sequence="19">212 JOSEPH NEEDHAM sense or as a noun.155 The latter interpretation seems to have been adopted by the Thang poet Liu Tsung-Yuan [146] (773 to 819 A.D.) (G/1361) who wrote an essay Thien Tui [147] (Answers about Heaven),156 which was intended to answer one by one the somewhat rhetorical questions of Chhi Yuan, so also a late commentator on the Thien Tui glossed " tse fa yeh " [148]; tse here means law or method. Perhaps a clearer case is that of a phrase in the biography of the great later Han astronomer Chang Heng [149] (78 to 139 A.D.) (G/55): "Thien pu yu chhang ts " [150], "The steps of heaven [i.e., the number of degrees passed through by constellations in a given time, their risings and settings, etc.] follow unvarying rules." 157 This is undoubtedly the kind of thought which led his contemporary Wang Chhung [151] to give support to individual astrology (cf. fn. 116 above), and Chang Heng's remark (for it is in a recorded speech of his) occurs in an astrological context. On the other hand, it is ex- tremely interesting that the application of tse [142] to natural phe- nomena is expressly denied. Thus the Huai Nan Tzu [152] book says: 158 The Tao of Heaven operates mysteriously and secretly (Thien Tao hsuan mo [153]); it has no fixed shape (wu yung [154]); it follows no defi- nite rules (wu tse [155]); it is so great that you can never come to the end of it, it is so deep that you can never fathom it. (tr. auct.) And again eight centuries later by Liu Tsung-Yuan [146], in the passage just referred to, where he says: " Heaven has no color of any kind, no center and no sides-how can you hope to find [lit. see] its tse [142]?" I have noted two other instances of the denial or doubt that Nature works according to tse [142]. The first is from a passage in that part of the Chhu Tzhu [156] (Elegies of Chiu) which contains the poetical writings of Chia I [157], and therefore dates from about 170 B.C. Heaven and Earth are like a smelting-furnace, the forces of natural change are the workmen (tsao hua wei kung [158]), the Yin and the Yang are the fuel, and the myriad things are the metal. Now it runs together (ho [159]), now it disperses (san [160]), sometimes moving and sometimes resting. But there is no fixed law (an yu chhang tse [161]), and in the 155 Forke (The World-Conception of the Chinese: Their Astronomical, Cosmo- logical and Physico-Philosophical Speculations [London, 1925], 136) evidently con- sidered it as a consequential word, for he rendered the sentence "The vault of Heaven has the shape of Nine Storeys. ... . 156 Contained in TSCC, chhien hsiang tien, ch. 11, i, i wen 2, p. 2. 157 Hou Han Shu, ch. 89, 5a. 158 Ch. 9, lb.</page><page sequence="20">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 213 thousand changes and the myriad transformations there is no definite norm (wei shih yu chi [162]). . ..159 (tr. Forke, eng. auct.) The second is from the commentary of Wang Pi [163] on the I Ching [137a] (Book of Changes), and must therefore date from the close neighborhood of 240 A.D. Explaining the twentieth kua, kuan [164], meaning view or vision, he says: The general meaning of the Tao of kuan [164] is that one should not govern by means of punishments and legal pressure, but by looking forth one should exert one's influence [by example] so as to change all things. Divine law has no sanctions 160 (Shen tse wu hsing che yeh [167]). We do not see Heaven command the four seasons, and yet they do not swerve from their course (Pu chien thien chih shih ssu shih, erh ssu shih pu the [168]). So also we do not see the sage ordering people about, and yet they obey and spontaneously serve him. (tr. auct.) This is perhaps the most illuminating passage of all. We have a flat denial of the conception of orders issued to the four seasons (and hence the courses of the stars and planets) by some celestial lawgiver. The thought is extremely Chinese. Universal harmony comes about not by the celestial fiat of some King of Kings, but by the spontane- ous co-operation of all beings in the universe brought about by their following the internal necessities of their own natures. One begins to see how deeply rooted in ancient Chinese ideas was the Neo-Con- fucian philosophy of organism. In Whitehead's idiom, the " atoms do not blindly run " as mechanical materialism supposed, nor are all entities specifically directed on their paths by divine intervention, as spiritualistic philosophies have supposed; but rather all entities at all levels behave in accordance with their position in the greater patterns (organisms) of which they are parts. And now one can also realize how superficial was the view that tse [169] ever meant anything like the laws of Nature in the Newtonian sense, and how dangerous it was to assume that such an interpretation could properly explain the thought about li [170] of the Neo-Confucians. 11. The Denial of a Celestial Lawgiver an Affirmation of the Spontaneity and Freedom of Nature The affirmation that Heaven does not command the processes of Nature to follow their regular courses is indeed linked with that root idea of Chinese thought, wu wei [171], non-action, or unforced action. 159 I follow Forke (Geschichte d. mittelalterlichen chinesischen Philosophie, 15), but am not sure whether the meaning is not rather that to these changes and trans- formations there is no limit. 160 Taking hsing [165] as hsing [166].</page><page sequence="21">214 JOSEPH NEEDHAM The legislation of a celestial lawgiver would be "wei," a forcing of things to obedience, involving imposition of sanctions. Nature shows a ceaselessness and regularity, yes, but it is not a commanded cease- lessness and regularity. The Tao of Heavens is a chhang Tao [172], the Order of Nature is an unvarying order, as Hsii Tzu [74a] says,161 but that is not the same thing as affirming that anyone ordered it to be so.162 Thus in the Li Chi (Record of Rites) 163 there is an apocryphal conversation between Confucius and Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke asked what was the most valuable thing to note about the ways of Heaven. The Master replied: " The most important thing about it is its ceaseless- ness. The sun and moon follow each other round from east to west without ceasing; such is the Tao of Heaven. Time goes on without interruption; such is the Tao of Heaven. Without any action being taken, all things come to their completion; such is the Tao of Heaven (wu wei erh wu chheng, shih Thien Tao yeh). (tr. Forke, ibid., 173; eng. auct.) Here again, then, is a denial, if an implicit one, of any heavenly crea- tion or legislation. It should be noted, in passing, that although the concept of wu wei [171] was emphasized particularly by the Taoists, it was part of the common ground of all ancient Chinese systems of thought, including the Confucians. It may be worth while following out this digression a little further. It is not at all difficult to find passages which confirm the conception of Heaven acting according to wu wei [171]; it runs throughout the Tao Te Ching (e.g., ch. 37), where we find the significant statement (in ch. 34) that though the Tao produces, feeds and clothes the myriad things, it does not lord it over them (erh pu wei chu [175]), and asks nothing of them. The idea is, in fact, a Taoist common- 161 Hsiun Tzu, ch. 17, la (tr. Dubs, op. cit., 173; Forke, Geschichte d. alten chinesischen Philosophie [Hamburg, 1927], 223). 162 Reasons for leaving Tao untranslated and for understanding it as the Order of Nature will be given elsewhere. The suggestion of Hu Shih (" Buddhist Influ- ence on Chinese Religious Life," Chinese Soc. &amp; Polit. Sci. Rev., 9 [1925], 142) that Tao could be translated as Laws of Nature is absolutely inadmissible (cf. Forke, 271). 0. Franke (op. cit.) in his otherwise so brilliant essay on the cosmic concep- tions of the ancient Chinese, mixes all kinds of ideas together, for example when he says: "Wie die ratio (logos, Xo'yo) im Gesetz (lex) und im Recht (jus) ihre Form findet, so aussert das Tao im te [174] oder im li" (which li is not clear) "seine universale Wirkung, und die' gesamte Welte' umfasst auch in China den himmlischen Staat so gut wie den irdischen." 163 Ch. 24 (Legge, The Texts of Confucianism, etc., Part III, the Li Ki [Li Chi], II, 268).</page><page sequence="22">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 215 place, and appears in such books as the Wen Tzu [176] 164 and many later writings. The Lii Shih Chhun Chhiu affords us a little further information into the working methods of the Tao of Heaven. In ch. 17165 we read: The operations of Heaven are profoundly mysterious (Thien chih yung, mi [176a]). It has water-levels for levelling, but it does not use them; it has plumblines for setting things upright, but it does not use them. It works in deep stillness . . . (yu chun pu i phing; yu sheng pu i chheng [177]). Thus it is said, Heaven has no form and yet the myriad things are brought to perfection. It is like the most impalpable of featureless essences, and yet the myriad changes are all brought about by it. (So also the sage is busied about nothing, and yet the thousand executives of State are effec- tive in the highest degree.) 166 This may be called the untaught teaching, and the wordless edict (zu nai wei pu chiao chih chiao, wu yen chih chao [178]). (tr. auct.) Such a conception is undeniably sublime. But how profoundly incom- patible it is with the conception of a celestial lawgiver. The move- ments of the celestial bodies proceeded, in the one case, according to teachings which no one had ever taught, and according to edicts which no one had ever issued, or even put into words. But the laws of Nature which Kepler, Descartes, Boyle and Newton believed that they were revealing to the human mind (the very word " revealing " is symptomatic of the spontaneous background of occidental thought), were edicts which had been issued by a supra-personal supra-rational being. The fact that this was later generally recognized to be a metaphor does not mean that it may not have had great heuristic value at the beginning of modern science in Europe. It would be of much value for the history of Chinese scientific thought to concentrate investigation on other occurrences of the ex- pression "Thien ts " [179]. But so far as my observations have gone, it is not a common one.167 The word " tse " seems to represent 164 The Wen Tzu (Book of Master Wen) is considered a work of Han date or even later, but may contain a considerable amount of pre-Chhin material. The passage referred to above appears in ch. 1, 11b (cf. Forke, ibid., 338). 165 3b; cf. Forke, ibid., 541. 166 The parentheses here indicate, not that the sentence is not in the text, but that it interrupts the sequence of thought which we are trying to follow. 167 There seems to be nothing like it in places where one would expect to find it, such as the Lii Shih Chhun Chhiu, the Lun Heng, or the ancient scientific frag- ments collected by Ma Kuo-Han. I have also failed to find it in the astronomical sections of the dynastic histories.</page><page sequence="23">216 JOSEPH NEEDHAM a borderline conception. Legal it certainly always was,168 and human too, but though occasionally applied in a scientific or proto-scientific sense, it did not seem to " catch on." Here the best support is Chang Heng. The I Ching passage is not very decisive, since in a book on divination, where the formation and transmutation of the hexagrams was supposed to mirror the changing processes of the real world, a strong poetical and symbolic element would be natural, and the im- plicit relevance to human affairs is brought out by the commentary, which says "that the hard should be able to act yieldingly, is Heaven's law (kang erh neng jo, Thien chih fa yeh [180])." The human rele- vance is also obvious in the Shih Ching verse. All these passages must, of course, have been well known to Chu Hsi, and the extent to which his conception of Li [181] involved the conception of Laws of Nature, can hardly be assessed until more is known as to the con- sensus of emphasis of the passages which he had in mind. Neverthe- less there is one feature of the crucial dialogue given at the beginning of this discussion, which suggests to me that laws of nature in the sense of scientific generalizations were not meant, namely the sentence underlined-" every event and thing has each its own rule of exist- ence." It is not said that every event and thing obeys general laws or rules valid for many other similar events and things. The thought is therefore much more applicable to events and things as organisms. There is no contradiction, but a difference of emphasis. 12. Neo-Confucianism as a Philosophy of Organism A further insight into what the Neo-Confucians meant by Li [181] and tse [182] may be obtained by looking into the Pei Chhi Tzu I [183] (Philosophical Glossary of Neo-Confucian Technical Terms), written by Chhen Shun [184], an immediate pupil of Chu Hsi, about the time of the latter's death (1200 A.D.). He analyzes, in a beauti- fully clear passage,'9 the meaning of Li: (1) Tao [185,] and Li [181] are roughly the same, but two words are used, and a distinction between them can be made. The difference is that Tao is what prevails [at the] human [level]. In comparison with Li, Tao is broader, and Li more profound. Li has the definite (chhio jan [186]) meaning of unchangeableness, so although the Tao has run through all the centuries (as a principle of variable human organization), the Li in all this time has never changed. 1e8 Cf. the numerous instances of its employment thus in the Tso Chuan. 169 Ch. 2, 5b. The numbering of the stages of the argument is mine.</page><page sequence="24">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 217 (2) Li [181] is formless; how could it be seen? Li [181] (Pattern or Organization) is a natural and unescapable law (i ko tang jan chih tse [187]) of affairs and things. It is a Patterning Law (li tse [188]). It is a Standardising Law (chun tse [189]). It is a Modelling Law (fa tse [190]). It conveys the idea of certainty and fixity (chhio ting [191]) and unchange- ableness (pu i [192]). The meaning of "natural and unescapable" (tang jan [193]) is that [human] affairs, and [natural] things, are made just exactly to fit into place (cheng tang ho tso chhu [194]). The meaning of " law " (tse [182]) is that the fitting into place (chhia hao [195]) occurs without the slightest excess (wu kuo [196]) or deficiency (wu pu chi [197]).170 (3) For instance, stopping 171 at benevolence is the natural unescapable- ness of the ruler. Stopping at respect is the natural unescapableness of the minister. Stopping at paternal love is the natural unescapableness of a father. Stopping at filial piety is the natural unescapableness of a son. Or in the case of the foot supporting the weight of the body, this supporting is the natural unescapableness of the foot. Or in the case of the hand, its ability to make polite motions of greeting is its natural unescapableness. Again, it is like the Impersonator of the Dead 172 who simply sits in the middle of the ceremony; this is the natural unescapableness of one who sits. And on the other hand it is like the Sacrificer, who stands during the cere- mony; this is the natural unescapableness of one who stands. (4) The men of old, investigating things to the utmost, and searching out Li [181], wanted to elucidate the natural unescapableness of [human] affairs and [natural] things; and this simply means that what they were looking for was all the exact places where things precisely fit together. Just that. (5) If we compare Li [181] with Hsing [200] [human nature], Li is the Li which permeates [non-human] things, while Hsing is the Li which permeates human selves. The Li which permeates [non-human] things is that [universal] Tao Li which is common to heaven and earth and to all human beings and to all things. But that which permeates human selves is that which has already the quality of specific individuation. (6) If we compare Li [181] with I [201] (righteousness), Li is what [organizes] the substance (thi [202]), while I is the same thing in function [or operation] (yung [203]). 170 This important conception is often met with in Neo-Confucian writings. 171 The reference is to the Ta Hsueh [198], I.1; " stopping at the highest excel- lence " (chih yu chi shan [199])-and not going beyond it by sophistical arguments. 172 In the ancient ceremonies for the dead, a living person thus acted.</page><page sequence="25">218 JOSEPH NEEDHAM Li [181] permeating things is the natural unescapableness of them; I [201] is how to handle this Li [181] [or direct or administer it]. Thus Chheng Tzu said " In things it is Li [181]; in handling things it is I [201]." (tr. auct.) It would hardly be possible to have more striking confirmation of the interpretation of Li [181] adopted earlier (in the Section on Neo- Confucianism) as the "principle of organization" in the universe. There is " law " implicit in it, but this law is the law which parts of wholes have to conform to by virtue of their very existence as parts of wholes. And this true whether they are material parts of material wholes, or non-material parts of non-material wholes. The most im- portant thing about parts is that they have to fit precisely into place with the other parts in the whole organism which they compose, with- out, as Chhen Shun says, the slightest excess or deficiency. There is nothing here about the fiat of any controller. Such laws as these were not the statutes of a celestial lawgiver analogous to an earthly prince, but arose, in the thought of the Neo-Confucians, directly out of the nature of the universe. Nor is there anything here which could remind us of fortuitous concourses of atoms, obeying some inscrutable laws of their own snowstorm, and in no way affected by the patterns which they generate in the chance succession of Nature's kaleido- scopic figures. In the first paragraph the Tao seems to be considered as something which, possessing an inner consistency, has allowed, through the ages, a certain amount of "play." But the cosmic organization has been whole and unchanging. It is, says the second paragraph, in effect a Great Pattern in which all lesser patterns are included, and the " laws " which are involved in it are intrinsic to these patterns, what- ever their degree of complexity, not extrinsic to them, and dominating them, as the laws of human society constrain individual men. The laws of the Neo-Confucian organicistic philosophy would thus be internal to the individual organisms at all levels, just as in later occidental philosophy it was felt that the laws of an ideal State should be written, not on tables, but in the hearts of its citizens. And thus leading from within (a profoundly Taoist contribution to this thought) the tse [204] would generate the pattern, standardize its manifestation, and model its form. In the third paragraph a number of instances of natural unescapa- bleness are given. In the case of the ruler, for instance, the meaning is that he has to act like that by the necessity of things, in order to succeed in being himself. If he did not, he would turn into some-</page><page sequence="26">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 219 thing else, and inevitably come to grief-we are reminded of one of the early Christian definitions of the Devil, 6 afdvTLTarv TO KO ICKOLS (Hippolytus)-" he who resists the cosmic process." And so for the other instances given. Among them it is important to note one of a purely biological organism, namely the foot and the body. In the fourth paragraph it is suggested that all those who have throughout the ages sought for meaning in the universe have really been looking for the Great Pattern. Finally the Principle of Organi- zation is traced in its specific individuation at the human level in human nature, and in its active manifestation there in the world of human relations and the administration of things. I conclude, therefore, that "law" was understood by the Neo- Confucian School in a distinctly Whiteheadian organismic sense. While one could not say that "law" in the Newtonian sense was completely absent from the minds of Chu Hsi and the Neo-Con- fucians in their definition of Li [205], it played a relatively minor (perhaps very minor) part, and the main component was " pattern " and hence pattern living and dynamic to the highest extent, and therefore "organism." In this philosophy of organism all things in the universe are included; Heaven, Earth and Man have the same Li [205.173 What exactly this phrase means is important for our argument. The following passage expounds it: 174 Someone asked the question: In the relation of parents and off-spring in tigers and wolves, of sovereign and minister in bees and ants, in the grati- tude to their creation of jackals and otters,175 and in the faculty of discrimi- nation of water-fowl and doves; 176 though the ethical principle (i li [206]) is received on one side only, yet if we thoroughly investigate the phenomena, we find that these creatures possess these ethical principles unerringly. On the other hand, all men possess the human fate [the Decree of Heaven (thien ming [207])] in its entirety, but it is so obscured by crea- turely desire, and by the material endowment, that sometimes they are not as well able as these animals to attain to their complete and perfect devel- opment. How do you explain this? 173 Chu Tzu Chhiian Shu, ch. 46, 7a (Bruce, The Philosophy of Human Nature, 280). Wang Chhung has a similar passage. 174 Ibid., ch. 42, 29a ff. 175 These animals were supposed to spread out their prey as if sacrificing to the gods before eating it. In fact otters are accustomed to consume only a part of their prey, and leave the rest on the riverbank; the false interpretation of this had begun as early as the time when the Li Chi [209] was written (Legge, The Texts of Con- fucianism, etc., Pt. III, vol. I, 221 and 251). It is mentioned in other Sung philoso- phers, notably Chheng I (Forke, Geschichte d. neueren chinesischen Philosophie, 97). 176 These animals were noted to be of monogamous habit.</page><page sequence="27">220 JOSEPH NEEDHAM [The philosopher] answered: It is only in these specific directions that these animals are intelligent, and there it is concentrated. But man's intel- ligence is comprehensive, embracing everything in some degree, but diffused, and therefore more easily obscured. Someone else asked the question: Can dried and withered things [as we should say-inorganic things] also possess a nature? (hsing [208], like human nature). [The philosopher] answered: They also possess Li [205] from the first moment of their existence; therefore it is said "There is nothing under Heaven which does not have its own Nature." Walking up some steps, the philosopher said: The bricks of these steps have the Li [205] of bricks. Sitting down, he said: A bamboo chair has the Li [205] of a bamboo chair. You may say [he went on] that dried and withered things (khu kao chih wu [210]) are without the vital impulse (seng i [211]), but not that they are without the Li [205] of specific exist- ence. For example, rotten wood is useless for anything except for putting in the cooking-stove. It is without the vital impulse. And yet each kind of wood as it burns has its own fragrance, each differing from the other. It is Li [205] which originally constituted it so. It was further asked: Is there Li [205], then, in dried and withered things? [The philosopher] answered: As soon as the object exists, Li [205] is inherent in it. Even in the case of a pen-though not produced by Heaven [directly], but by Man, who takes the long soft hairs of the hare and makes them into pens-as soon as it exists Li [205] is inherent in it. It was further asked: How can a pen possess Love and Righteousness? [The philosopher] answered: In small things like these there is no need for such distinctions as that between Love and Righteousness. (tr. Bruce, ibid., 64; slightly mod.) Someone said: Birds and beasts, as well as men, all have sensation and consciousness (chih chao [212]), though with different degrees of penetra- tion. Is there " consciousness " also in the vegetable kingdom? [The philosopher] answered: There is. Take the case of a plant, when watered, its flowers shed forth glory; when pinched, it withers and droops. Can it be said to be without " consciousness " [vital force] ? Chou Tun-I refrained from clearing away the grasses from in front of his window, be- cause, he said, "their vital impulse is just like my own." In this he at- tributed " consciousness " to the plants. But the " consciousness " of the animals is not on the same plane as man's consciousness, nor is the " con- sciousness " of plants on the same level as that of animals. Take, for exam- ple, the case of the drug rhubarb (ta huang [213]),177 when taken, it acts 177 Rheum officinale (R/582).</page><page sequence="28">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 221 as a purgative; while aconite (fu tzu [214])178 has heating properties- their " consciousness " (specific nature) can follow only one road. It was asked whether decayed [vegetable] material (fu pai chih wu [215]) also had [such a] "consciousness "? [The philosopher] answered: Yes, indeed it has. If it is burnt to ashes by fire and then heated with water, the liquid will be bitter and caustic. Then he smiled and said: Only today I met the gentlemen of Hsin-Chou, who maintained that vegetable things have no Nature, and now tonight you are suggesting that vegetable things have no "mind" (specific nature). (tr. Bruce, ibid., 68; slightly mod.) This passage is interesting in many respects.179 We see Chu Hsi, just as Chuang Chou [216], 1400 years before him,180 maintaining that the Tao (here the Li) runs through all things in the universe, that the universe is orderly, and, in a sense, rational. But not there- fore intelligible in the scientific as opposed to the philosophical sense, and not necessarily following rules capable of being formulated in a precise and abstract way by man. Chu Hsi expresses, moreover, what amounts to a conception of ethics in terms of levels of organization. "Inorganic" objects have their place, relatively low, in the overall pattern, and Chu Hsi is clearly feeling his way towards a classification of chemical properties-in his examples of potash and of alkaloidal drugs he steps into the opening of that long avenue which led to the inorganic and organic chemistry of our own time.181 But ethical and moral phenomena, properly so-called, only begin to appear when a sufficiently high level of organization is reached, first incompletely and one-sidedly in animals, and then fully in man. Chu Hsi says in so many words that moral concepts are not applicable to " inorganic " objects, though he himself, in a fashion exactly parallel to the ancient Taoists 182 cannot find words other than " consciousness " and " mind" when he wants to describe the properties of chemical substance. We seem to be in the presence, then, in the latter part of the twelfth century A.D., of a point of view rather similar to that which Ulpian had expressed in Europe nearly a millenium before, and which had been incorporated into the Justinian Digest.183 But the profound 178 Aconitum autumnale (R/532 a). 179 Cf. Forke, ibid., 172 and 193. 180 Cf. sec. 10 above. 181 Chu Hsi would have appreciated greatly the fact that the formulae of organic chemistry are patterns. 182 Cf. the failure of the Taoists to elaborate mineralogical technical terms. 183 Cf. p. 24 above, Part I.</page><page sequence="29">222 JOSEPH NEEDHAM difference is that while Ulpian had spoken quite uncompromisingly of law, Chu Hsi relies chiefly on a technical term the primary meaning of which is pattern. For Ulpian (as for the Stoics) all things were "citizens" subject to a universal law; for Chu Hsi all things were elements of a universal pattern. On the whole, it does not appear that it is possible to find more than traces of the concept of Laws of Nature in the greatest of Chinese philosophical schools, the Neo-Con- fucians of the Sung. The second statement is a famous one of Ulpian, the eminent Roman jurist (d. 228 A.D.) 184 whose work occupies so large a part of the Justinian Corpus Juris Civilis,l85 of 534 A.D. "Jus naturale," he says in the first paragraph of the Digest, " est quod natura omnia animalia docuit. . . " 13. Buddhist Thought Concerning Law What of Buddhism? It had been in reacting against Buddhist philosophy that the Neo-Confucians had produced their great syn- thesis. Buddhist philosophy, while denying the existence of a soul or spirit which could persist after the dissolution of the skandhas (yiin [217]), i.e., the material and mental components of the individual, nevertheless retained the Hindu or Brahminical theory of transmigra- tion. Hence the doctrine of karma (yin yuan [218]) which stated that " as soon as a sentient being (man, animal or god) dies, a new being is produced in a more or less painful and material state of exist- ence, according to the karma, the desert or merit, of the being who had died. . . . The karma of the previous set of skandhas, or sentient being, determines the locality, nature, and future of the new set of skandhas, of the new sentient being." 180 In this way, morality, as the Buddhists conceived of it, was set right at the heart of the uni- versal scheme of things, and this was the Law (fa [219]) of which one hears so much in connection with Buddhism.187 There is no doubt that with its conception of karma Buddhism 184 The Corpus comprises the Digest (legal literature) about one-third of which was written by Ulpian, the Institutes (students' books), and the Codex (enacted laws). 185 J. C. Ledlie has given a good account of him: "Ulpian," Jour. Soc. Comp. Legisl., 5 (1905), 14. 186 T. W. Rhys Davids, "Buddhism," SPCK (London, 1910), 101. 187 Cf. the practice, of which we have already seen examples, of calling eminent Buddhist philosophers " Masters of the Law." See also T. W. Rhys Davids, Bud- dhism, Its History and Literature (New York, 1907).</page><page sequence="30">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 223 emphasized very strongly cause and effect in Nature, even though with a purely moral reference. Here we are still in the primitive undifferentiated stage of law, and there is a certain similarity between the ancient Indian conception of the virtues and vices of an individual having their inescapable result in the endowment with which another linked individual begins his or her existence on the one hand, and the ancient Chinese conception of the effect of the virtues and vices of human leaders having their inescapable results in natural calamities or the behavior of the weather, on the other. Human morality was still inextricably bound up with the phenomena of non-human Nature. "The operation of karma," Streeter rightly said,'88 "was conceived not juristically as the punishment of a continuing ego, but naturalistically in terms of a law of cause and effect, which was thought of as mechanistically as in the physical sciences." One might therefore be tempted to suppose that the Law of the Buddhists could have led rather easily to the development of the idea of laws of Nature dissociated from the moral-ethical element. In an interesting paper,'89 Rhys Davids maintained that besides animism, another fundamental belief should be distinguished in primitive thought-he suggested the name "normalism." By this he meant all those ancient beliefs which concerned, not souls, spirits, gods or demons, but certain "laws" of cause and effect, or certain regular patterns of action in the universe. In this second category he included the Tao of the Taoists, and the apparently rather similar idea of Rta (motion, rhythmic motion, order, cosmic order, moral order, the right) found in the Indian Vedas, and also the Yin and Yang hypothesis- none of these were ever personified or personifiable-and lastly the Buddhist law of karma. But this does not take us as far as the Laws of Nature in the true scientific sense, for which conception order, pat- tern, causality, regularity do not quite suffice. Indeed Berriedale Keith categorically denies that Buddhist philosophy ever thought of extending to the non-moral sphere a strict applicability of their belief in causality.190 Perhaps one basic reason why the law of karma could not lead to a scientific conception of the laws of Nature was because of the parallel doctrine (not indeed strictly speaking Buddhist, though China derived it from India through Buddhist channels) that the visible world is illusion, maya (mi [220]).191 It was precisely from the 188 B.

The last thing, therefore, to which their philosophy could invite, was a dispassionate study of the phenomena of non-human Nature-that was in fact the Wheel of illusory existence from which they offered a way of escape. Hence it is not surprising that neither in India nor in China did the idea of Laws of Nature arise from this source. 14. Contrasting European and Chinese Attitudes to Animal Abnormalities Before concluding, we may glance at a striking illustration of the difference in outlook between China and Europe in the matter of natural law. It is generally known that during the European middle ages there was a considerable number of trials and criminal prosecu- tions of animals in courts of law, followed frequently by capital punishment in due form. Evans has gone to the trouble to collect a large amount of information on these cases, building on the earlier work of Berriat St. Prix, Menebrea, and von Amira. Their frequency follows a curve with a well-marked peak at the sixteenth century, rising from three instances in the ninth to about sixty in the six- teenth, and falling to nine in the nineteenth century; and it seems doubtful whether this is due, as Evans suggests, to lack of adequate records for the earlier periods. The peak corresponds to the witch- mania (Withington). The trials fall into three types, (a) the trial and execution of domestic animals for attacking human beings (e.g., the execution of pigs for devouring infants), (b) the excommunica- tion, or rather anathematization, of plagues or pests of birds or in- sects, (c) the condemnation of "lusus naturae," e.g., the laying of eggs by cocks. It is the last two which are most interesting for the present theme. In 1474 a cock was sentenced to be burnt alive for the "heinous and unnatural crime " of laying an egg, at Basel; and there was another Swiss prosecution of the same kind as late as 1730. One of the reasons for the alarm involved was perhaps that "oeuf coquatri " was thought to be an ingredient in witches' ointments, and that the basilisk or cockatrice, a particularly venomous animal, hatched from it.192 But the interest of the story lies in the fact that 92 Needham, A History of Embryology (Cambridge, 1934), 85; P. A. Robin, Animal Lore in English Literature (London, 1932), 86. The legend appears first in Alexander Neckham (S/II, 385) late in the twelfth century. In 1710 A.D. La- peyronie showed that what were taken for cock's eggs were small almost yolkless eggs laid by hens suffering from diseases obstructing their oviducts.</page><page sequence="32">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 225 such trials would have been absolutely impossible in China. The Chinese were not so presumptuous as to suppose that they knew suffi- ciently well the laws laid down by God for non-human things to obey, as to enable them to indict an animal at law for transgressing them. On the contrary, the Chinese reaction would undoubtedly have been to treat these rare and frightening phenomena as chhien kao [221] (reprimands from heaven),193 and it was the emperor or the provincial governor whose position would have been endangered, not the cock's. Let us quote chapter and verse. In the long Wu Hsing Chih [222] (Discussion of the Five Elements) in the Chhien Han Shu 94 (His- tory of the Former Han Dynasty) there are several references to sex- reversals in poultry 195 and in man.196 These were classified under the heading of " green misfortune " (chhing hsiang [223]) and thought of as connected with the activities of the element Wood.197 They fore- boded serious harm to the rulers in whose dominions they occurred. While the contrast between China and Europe is as stated, there were exceptions in each civilization. As regards the second of the three types of prosecution mentioned above, it is interesting that the European mediaeval attitude wavered. Sometimes the field-mice or locusts were considered to be breaking God's laws, and therefore sub- ject to prosecution and conviction by man, while at other times the view prevailed that they had been sent to admonish men to repent- ance and amendment. Conversely, there are late folk-tales in China involving the arraignment of tigers in courts of law. Somewhat related to this matter is the English law of deodands or banes, under which inorganic, inanimate objects, or animals, which caused the death of human beings were forfeited to the Church or the Crown.198 "Omnia quae movent ad mortem sunt Deo danda" (Bracton). This law, not abolished till 1846, perhaps originated from the same complex of ideas, namely that non-living things could trans- gress the laws of God just as human beings could. There can have been no parallel to this in Chinese jurisprudence. 15. The Comparative Philosophy of Law in China and Europe The only examination of the comparative philosophy of law in 193 This is especially well seen in Wang Chhung's Lun Heng. 194 Ch. 27. 195 Ch. 27 b a, pp. 20 a b, ff. 196 Ch. 27 c a, p. 18 b. 197 Cf.

He is fully justified in his firm conviction of the importance of li [224] as against fa [225] in Chinese thought and practice, and he notes cor- rectly the attitude of the Legalists and Confucians. He is right, I am sure, in emphasizing the direct verifiability of the god customs to which the Confucians appealed, as opposed to the necessity of taking on trust what the codifiers, whether European or Chinese, built up into their positive law. One can contrast the non-codified customary, demonstrable ethical droit of the Confucian paternalistic sage-kings, with the codified, enacted, non-demonstrable, non-ethical law of the Fa Chia. He notes that a word such as "person" has a different significance in Confucian li [224] with its ever-variable flexibility from that which it has in the deductively formulated abstract phrase- ology of Roman law. On the other hand, his contention that Chinese law was based on non-human Nature is not convincing; it rests on a misapprehension of what "the study of things" (ko wu [226])200 meant in Chinese tradition, and on some perhaps rather exaggerated remarks of Granet's about the imitation of animals in the primitive mating festivals. But more fundamental is his main conclusion, that Chinese law differed from European law because the Chinese appre- hended Nature in a different way from Europeans. This rests on the general view of Northrop that while the Greeks developed the way of knowing Nature by postulation and scientific hypothesis, the Chinese approached Nature throughout their history only by direct inspection and aesthetic intuition. Such a view is, I fear, contradicted by almost all the facts which are brought together in a thorough study of Chi- nese science and technology. There seems no reason to deny to the theories of the Yin and Yang [227], the Five Elements, etc., the same status of scientific hypotheses as can be claimed by the ideas of the pre-Socratic and other Greek schools. What went wrong with Chinese science was its failure to develop out of these theories forms more adequate to the growth of empirical knowledge, and in particular its failure to apply mathematics to the formulation of regularities in natural phenomena.201 For these failures the pressure of the social 199 G. L. Dorsey, "Two Objective Bases for a Worldwide Legal Order," in Ideological Differences and World Order, ed. F. S. C. Northrop (New Haven, 1949). 200 Although this phrase has been taken up to mean natural science in modern times, it always meant, until the present century, the study of human affairs. 201 An interesting little point here to which I have not seen attention called</page><page sequence="34">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 227 and economic system must be held largely responsible, and differences in the Chinese apprehension of Nature as such cannot, as I see it, explain the difference between Chinese and European conceptions of law. In Europe natural law may be said to have helped the growth of natural science because of its universality. But in China, since natu- ral law was never thought of as law, and took a special name, li [230], it was very hard to think of it as in any way applicable outside human society, although it was relatively much more important than natural law in Europe. When order and system and pattern were visualized as running through the whole of Nature, it was not as li [230] but as the Tao [231] of the Taoists or the Li [232] of the Neo- Confucians, both of which were rather inscrutable, and neither of which had a juristic content. Again, in Europe positive law may be said to have helped the growth of natural science because of its precise formulation, and be- cause it encouraged the idea that to the earthly lawgiver there corre- sponded in heaven a celestial one, whose writ ran wherever there were material things. In order to believe in the rational intelligibility of Nature, the Western mind had to presuppose (or found it very con- venient to presuppose) the existence of a Supreme Being who, himself rational, had put it there. This brings us to a conclusion which must be reached in any study of the Taoists. The Taoists, though profoundly interested in Nature, distrusted reason and logic. The Mohists and the Logicians fully believed in reason and logic, but if they were interested in Nature it was only for practical reasons. The Legalists and Confucians were not interested in Nature at all. Now this gulf between empirical nature-observers and rationalist thinkers, is not found to anything like the same extent in European history, and as Whitehead has sug- gested, this was perhaps because European thought was so dominated by the idea of a supreme creator being, whose own rationality was the guarantee of rational intelligibility in his creation. Whatever may be the needs of mankind now, such a supreme God had inevitably to be before is the fact that the Han legal code in nine sections was called the Chiu Chang. (Of course sinologists have sometimes unthinkingly translated Tao as "law," e.g., Forke, Lun Heng, Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung [Shanghai, London, 1907- 1911], II, 157, in a remark of Wang Chhung " thien jen thung Tao," [229] Heaven and Man have the same Tao. But the rendering is, I believe, quite unjustified.) It may or may not be a coincidence that one of the earliest mathematical books we possess is the Chiu Chang Suan Ching [228] (Mathematical Classic in Nine Sec- tions). Could there have been an arriere-pensee about Laws of Nature here?</page><page sequence="35">228 JOSEPH NEEDHAM personal. This we do not find in Chinese thought. Even the pres- ent-day Chinese translation of Laws of Nature is tzu-jan fa [233], spontaneous law, a phrase which uncompromisingly retains the ancient Taoist denial of a personal God, and yet is almost a contradiction in terms. Here we cannot investigate the ancient Chinese conceptions of God. An immense literature exists on the subject, since the Christian missionaries in the last few centuries engaged in great debates as to the correct translation of European terms; 202 most of this is now not worth the paper on which it is written, since at that time sinological studies were in their infancy. We know that the most ancient terms for God in Chinese were Thien [234] (Heaven) or Shang Ti [235] (The Ruler above), though other terms were used, e.g., Tsai [236] (Governor) in Chuang Tzu. Thien (K/361) is undoubtedly an anthropomorphic graph (presumably of a deity) in its most ancient form,203 and Ti (K/877) though not absolutely clear, is distinctly anthropomorphic also. So, I think, is tsai (K/382, 965) which is related to a character meaning "demon." Much sinological work is being done on the extent to which there was in ancient China a personalization of these conceptions, and it is hard to summarize such conclusions as have been reached. Many theories are in the field; Creel,204 for instance, thinks that Shang Ti was a transcendentaliza- tion of the function of the emperor (or bronze-age High King); Granet205 considers that he was a personification of the calendrical order of the seasons; another view, represented by Fitzgerald,26 looks upon him, and upon Thien, as symbols of the Original Ancestor. Creel 207 expresses the now generally received opinion that Shang Ti is the older of the two, being associated with the Shang dynasty, while Thien is rather a later Chou dynasty term. Tai Kuan-I 208 believes 202 See Cordier, Bibliotheca Sinica; Dictionnaire bibliographique des ouvrages relatifs a I'empire chinois (3 vols., Paris, 1878-1895; 2nd ed., 5 vols., Vienna, 1904- 1924), Pt.

Diss., Chicago.</page><page sequence="36">HUMAN LAWS AND LAWS OF NATURE (II) 229 that the name Shang Ti was taken over from the Miao peoples by the Chinese. But in any case two things are clear, (a) that the de-personalization of God in ancient Chinese thought excluded the conception of a divine celestial lawgiver imposing ordinances on non- human Nature; and (b) that the highest spiritual being known and worshiped was never a Creator in the sense of the Hebrews and the Greeks. It was not that there was no order in Nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no guarantee that other rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their own earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had previously formulated. There was no confidence that the code of Nature's laws could be unveiled and read, because there was no assurance that a divine being, even more rational than ourselves, had ever formulated such a code or made it readable. One feels, indeed, that the Taoists, for example, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive to be adequate to the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it. It is extremely interesting that modern science, in so far as since the time of Laplace it has been found possible and even desirable to dispense completely with the hypothesis of a God as the basis of the laws of Nature, has returned, in a sense, to the Taoist outlook. This is what accounts for the strangely modern ring in so much of the writing of that great school. But historically the question remains whether natural science could ever have reached its present stage of development without passing through a " theological " stage. In the outlook of modern science there is, of course, no residue of the notions of command and duty in the " laws " of Nature.209 They are now thought of as statistical regularities, valid only in given times and places, descriptions not prescriptions, as Karl Pearson put it in a famous chapter. The exact degree of subjectivity in the formulations of scientific law has been hotly debated during the whole period from Mach to Eddington, and such questions cannot be followed further here. The problem is whether the recognition of such statistical regu- larities and their mathematical expression could have been reached by any other road than that which Western science actually traveled. Was the state of mind in which an egg-laying cock could be prose- cuted at law necessary in a culture which should later have the property of producing a Kepler? 209 One is occasionally reminded by odd expressions of the common root of juridical and scientific law. Twenty years ago a native of Arizona absent-mindedly said to me: " The Government has decided these sahuaro cactuses grow half an inch a year "-thus delightfully confusing the government with its botanist.</page><page sequence="37">230 JOSEPH NEEDHAM 16. Conclusion To sum up, therefore, I would say that the conception of the Laws of Nature did not develop from Chinese conceptions of law in general, for the following reasons. First, the Chinese acquired a great distaste for precisely formulated abstract codified law from their bad experi- ence with the School of Legalists during the period of transition from feudalism to bureaucratism. Secondly, after the system of bureaucra- tism had grown up, the old conceptions of li [230] proved more suitable than any others for Chinese society in its typical form, and therefore the element of natural law was much more important rela- tively in Chinese than in European society. But the fact that so much of it was not put into formal legal terms, and that it was over- whelmingly human and ethical in content, made it impossible to extend its sphere of influence to any form of non-human Nature. Thirdly, the available ideas of a supreme being, though certainly present from the earliest times, failed to retain enough personalized creativity to allow of the development of the conception of precisely formulated abstract laws ordained from the beginning by a celestial lawgiver for non-human Nature, and capable, because of his ration- ality, of being deciphered or re-formulated by other lesser rational beings using the methods of observation, experience, hypothesis, and mathematical reasoning. The Chinese world-view depended upon a totally different line of thought. The harmonious co-operation of all beings arose, not from the orders of a superior authority external to themselves, but from the fact that they were all parts in a hierarchy of wholes forming a cosmic pattern, and what they obeyed were the internal dictates of their own natures. Modern science and the philosophy of organism, with its integrative levels, has come back to this wisdom, fortified by our new understanding of cosmic, biological and social evolution; though who shall say that the Newtonian phase was not an essential one? And lastly, always in the background stood the concrete forces of the social and economic life of Chinese society, out of which arose the transition from feudalism to bureaucratism mentioned above, and which could not but condition at every step the science and philosophy of the Chinese people. Had these conditions been basically favorable to science, the inhibiting factors considered in this paper might perhaps have been overcome. Caius College, Cambridge.</page></plain_text>
