<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW No. III.-JULY i886 The Earliest Inhkabitants of Greece AS the limits of our knowledge expand with the aid of new ex- plorationg and more comprehensive criticism, it is natural to repeat the old questions which lie at the threshold of Greek history: Were the Greeks the first inhabitants of the countrJy which afterwards bore their name ? By what route did they enter the peninsula ? What do we know of their early civilisation ? Even now these questions do not admit of any definite solution, yet the answers given to them are necessarily different from what they were ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. First in importance are the facts which exploration has brought to light bearing upon the earliest inhabitants of Greece.-A few but certain traces of the stone age have been found. About a dozen stone axes and hammers of the neolithic period exist in various museums, procured chiefly in the south of Eubcea, and arrowheads of flint are said to be common in the neighbourhood of Cephisia in Attica. There seems to be no valid reason for doubting that these relics proceed from a primitive age; and if this is the case they are evidence of the occupation of the country by tribes in a low state of civilisation, though they do not in the least enable us to decide whether these tribes are Indo-Germanic or not. Probably a careful search, especially in the southern part of Eubcea, would enable us to add largely to evidence of this class. In Greece, as in Scot- land, the peasants have a superstitious reverence for stone imple- ments, and carefully preserve and hide those which they find. More important by far are the remains of the ancient dwellings which have been discovered in the Santorin group of islands. As is well known, the islands of Santorin (Thera) and Therasia are remnants of the exterior walls of a volcano which at some prehistoric 27</page><page sequence="2">418 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE July period rose as an unbroken cone from the sea. Successive eruptions hollowed the interior of the cone until it was no longer able to support the weight of the matter poured upon the sides from the crater. The cone sank into the sea, leaving two fragments, of which the larger is the ancient island of Thera, the smaller the island of Therasia. When this catastrophe occurred we do not know. It was long before the period at which ancient history may be said to com- mence in the 2Egean. There is not so much as a hint of it in any Grecian legend. It is however certain, from excavations made in the existing islands, that the slopes of the volcano, when it existed entire, were inhabited, and that the inhabitants had obtained considerable skill in the arts of life. They built houses, in the construction of which wood was employed, partly for the roof, partly in the windows, and also in the walls, apparently with the object of rendering the stonework more elastic. They cultivated certain cereals such as peas and barley. They kept flocks and herds and made cheese. The dog was domesticated among them. Above all, they were adepts in the art of pottery. They were not only able to manufacture vases of elegant shape and good workmanship, but also jars of immense size for the storage of their crops. The position in which the houses were found, resting on the lava, and beneath the superincumbent coat of 'puzzolan,' leaves no doubt that they ex- isted before the disastrous eruption which consigned them to ruin. It appears also from an examination of the material of which the vases were made, that they were manufactured in the island, and, though oriental influences appear, they display, for the most part, original work. They are probably the oldest relics yet discovered in the Mediterranean (though not so old as the pottery of Hissarlik). Yet even in this early period they appear to have been an article of merchandise. To what race this prehistoric nation belonged we have no means of ascertaining. The discovery of their existence makes it probable that the islands of the AEgean at ariy rate were inhabited at a date far earlier than any recorded in Greek legend. With one or two exceptions, there is no trace of any metal in these prehistoric houses. The implements are all of stone. That other islands of the AEgean had a very large population in early times is shown by Mr. Bent in his interesting volume on the Cyclades. But if the islands were so thickly populated, are we to suppose that the mainland was a desert? The remains discovered at Mycenae are of course much more varied and important than those on Santorin. Mycenae was a great name from the earliest times in Greece. However unhistorical the Homeric poems may be, they are at least evidence that epic tradition connected a great dynasty with the ancient city. To the Greek this dynasty was naturally Hellenic. But it is here that the puzzle</page><page sequence="3">1886 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE 419 of the antiquary begins. The remains found at Mycenae cannot be harmonised in all respects with the descriptions in the Homeric poems, and still less with later Greece. In his Greek History, Professor Duncker meets this difficulty, at least in part, by a theory that the great fortifications of Mycense and Tiryns are the work of Achaean princes, who were able to profit by the lessons taught them by oriental settlers. When they wished to be rid of the unwelcome intruders, they established themselves behind their strong fortresses. A more recent writer, who has studied the subject with especial care, Professor Helbig, is induced by the discrepancies which he finds be- tween the Homeric epics and the remains at Mycenae to regard the latter as a purely oriental settlement.' Among the innumerable articles discovered, there is nothing that can be called distinctively Greek. Though the weight of Greek tradition is against this theory, there is a curious passage in Thucydides which implies that the Greeks who went to Troy were barbarians. Speaking of Argos Amphilochicum he remarks: ' The Amphilochian territory had been occupied, and the city founded by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus, who in returning home from the Trojan war was dissatisfied at the state of Argos. Many generations afterwards, the Amphilochians of the city invited their neighbours, the Ambraciots, to join in the settlement, and from them they first learned the Hellenic language which they now speak; the other Amphilochians are barbarians.' That there is much at Mycense which cannot be harmonised with later Greece is obvious; the abundance of gold and the use of the war chariot are striking instances of discrepancy. But in these respects the Homeric poems and the Mycensean relics tally; and the question inevitably arises: What is the historical value of the epic poetry of Greece and the picture of civilisation which it presents to us ? To enter into a discussion of so complicated a question would lead us far away from the immediate subject of this paper. We may, however, remark- 1. That there is no reason to suppose that the tradition em- bodied in the ' Iliad ' and ' Odyssey ' is more trustworthy than other traditions which have not received such successful treatment by poets. If therefore we find the Homeric tradition at variance with other traditions, we need not necessarily assume that the Homeric is the older. 2. The mere fact that the ' Iliad' and ' Odyssey' have survived, while other poems have been lost, gives an undue prominence to the traditions embodied in them. The Theban epic, for instance, must have given quite a different view of the condition of Bceotia and Argos from that contained in the catalogue of the ' Iiad.' Which of the two is more correct ? I Helbig, Das Homerische Epos, p. 39 f. ' Soweit die Funde ein Urteil verstatten erscheinen die Mykeniier recht eigentlich als Orientalen ' (p. 45).</page><page sequence="4">420 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE July 3. The celebrity of the Homeric poems doubtless caused many local myths to be altered. For instance: The Theseid line of kings at Athens is broken to admit Menestheus, who in the ' Iliad' repre- sents Athens at Troy. Does the ' Iliad' record a fact, or have we an alteration of Athenian legend to suit it ? 4. There is no reason to assume that an event, or custom, or myth, is necessarily post-Homeric because it is non-Homeric. And if the ' Odyssey' is later than the ' Iliad,' it is not because it contains fairy tales, for fairy tales are quite as old as martial songs, though they may not amuse the same audience. If these considerations are duly borne in mind, it is clear that the evidence of the Homeric poems must be received with extreme caution by the historian. If they speak of the Atreidae as Acha3ans, that is not a proof that the dynasty was really Greek. Other legends carry us to Asia Minor, and exploration, so far as it has gone, seems to confirm this connexion. Sculptures closely parallel to the lions over the gate at Mycenae have been found on tombs in Phrygia by Professor Ramsay. Hence we have reason to believe in the existence of an oriental population on the eastern coast of Hellas. We may of course regard the orientals as the invaders, establishing themselves on territory already in the possession of Greeks. But there is no cogent evidence for this, and we may with equal probability regard the Greeks as invaders, who expelled the oriental population from the eastern side of the peninsula, from Peloponnesus and the islands. The final scenes in this conflict were the conquests of Orchomenos, Thebes, and Argos, which became themes of Hellenic epic song and tradition. Who these orientals were, we cannot say. We may probably connect them, as legend does, with that empire (Hittite or otherwise) which has left such remarkable memorials of its former magnificence in Asia Minor. Or they may have belonged to the race of the Carians, who, if Indo-Germanic in origin, were at an early period brought into contact with Semitic civilisation. It has been often maintained that the Greeks came into the peninsula, not across the ]Egean, but from the north-west. And if we look at the distribution of population, it is undeniable- 1. That the Pelasgi and Hellenes (assuming the two to be ethno- logically the same) had their sacred settlement at Dodona. 2. That the interior of Asia Minor was occupied by a popula- tion which, judging from the remaining monuments, was not Indo- Germanic. 3. That the kingdom of Thrace lay between the Hellenes and the Bosphorus, rendering access to the peninsula by that route difficult. But, on the other hand, it is equally undeniable that both sides</page><page sequence="5">1886 EARLIEST INIHABITANTS OF GREECE 421 of the ]Egean were occupied by a population of similar race, which passed backwards and forwards. Strabo calls attention to the similarity of names on both sides of the AEgean: there was a Scaan tribe in Thrace, and a Sceean gate in Troy. Arisbos was the name of a Thracian river, Arisba of a Lesbian town. Larisae were found in the Troad and in Thessaly. In Herodotus we hear of the migra- tion of Mysians into Europe, and of Thracians into Asia. There are Pelasgi in the Troad and at Dodona; the Leleges, whose relics were so common in Caria, were also the inhabitants of the Pelopon- nesus and Acarnania. The conclusion is that, though it may be true that the movement which hellenised Greece proceeded from the north-west of the peninsula, there is every reason to assume that both sides of the Egean were occupied by a kindred population at a very early period. This population was probably in the main Indo-Germanic. Whether it came to the west below or above the Caucasus there is as yet no sufficient evidence to show. It was incapable of the intellectual and moral development of the western section, and gradually passed away to make room for those who became the Hellenes of history. There is, therefore, considerable reason to doubt whether we can speak of the peninsula of Greece as uninhabited before the arrival of the Greeks, or of the Greeks themselves as an homogeneous Indo-Germanic nation entering the country from the north-west, and forcing their way to the south past the Thracians and Illyrians. On the contrary, we seem to have evidence that the country was inhabited by tribes uising stone implements; and that in the islands a nation using apparently no instruments but what were made of stone attained to considerable skill in the art of pottery and of building. On the eastern side of Greece we find traces of great monarchies, probably oriental, which were perhaps connected with monarchies in Asia Minor. At the same time a population of Indo-Germanic race was spread over both sides of the Egean in the Troad and in Thessaly, in Bithynia, Phrygia, and Thrace. In what relation, this population stood to the monarchies of Boeotia and Mycen,e we cannot say. Eventually a tribe belonging to this Indo-Germanic nation developed into the Greeks of historical times. The evidence of language appears to confirm these deductions. This is a subject in which, it is true, we still labour under great dif- ficulties. We know little or nothing of the languages of the nations which lay to the north of Greece, the Illyrians and Thracians. Even the dialects of Greece proper are very imperfectly represented. In the Greek of our dictionaries there are many words of which we can give no account. Are these the sole survivors of some lost Indo-Germanic roots, or are they of alien stock ? The languages of Asia Minor are still a matter of dispute. Even if we allow the</page><page sequence="6">422 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE July Indo-Germanic origin of the western dialects such as Phrygian, Carian, &amp;c., what is the truth about the Armenian ? Herodotus calls the Armenians ' colonists' of the Phrygians. Was he misled by language, or had the ' Proto-Armenians' even then disappeared ? Till these matters are clearer, we cannot tell whether the Semites of the Mesopotamian valley did or did not bar the progress of Indo-Germanic races to the west. But at any rate a review of the geographical names in Greece will make two things plain: first, that similar names occur in dif- ferent places; and secondly, that many names of places cannot be explained as Greek. From the first we draw the conclusion that various localities in Greece were inhabited by the same nation or tribe; and from the second it becomes extremely probable that some nation or nations which did not speak Greek inhabited parts of the peninsula. Such names as Euboea, Boeotia, Sparta, Leucas, Arcadia, Caryae, and perhaps Orchomenos, Eleusis, and Sicyon, were given by a nation speaking Greek. On the other hand, the names of Tiryns, Messenia, Athens, Salamis, AEgina, Corinth, Thebes, Thessaly, Phocis, are not easily explained from the Greek language. The interpretation of these doubtful names is attended by the greatest difficulties. One scholar discovers an Albanian element in them, another a Pelasgic, a third a Phoenician. It is by no means certain, or perhaps probable, that they are to be ex- plained by reference to any one language. In some instances the existence of a Phcenician element seems to be certainly tenable. Kothon is the name of a small island off Cythera, and also of a small harbour at Carthage. We may therefore assume, notwithstand- ing the existence of the Greek word KC(00w, that we have here the Greek form of the Pheenician word qaton, small. Marathon again may be a Phoenician word (amnrath), though pa'paoso is a Greek word signifying fennel. But this is a subject which still requires systematic treatment. Before we can stand on any firm footing it is necessary to arrange and classify Greek geographical names, separating those which are easy of explanation from those which are not, and observing how far the two exist side by side in the same localities. It is also necessary to ascertain, so far as our evi- dence will permit, what changes Phaenician words underwent when adopted by Greeks. Even then there will remain a large residuum of words which cannot be explained either as Greek or Phoenician, and it is not likely that our knowledge of Carian or other similar languages will ever be sufficient to allow us to carry our researches in that direction. Another source from which we may hope to glean information about the earliest inhabitants of Hellas is their religion. Next to its language, a nation's religion is its earliest possession. But in</page><page sequence="7">1886 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE 423 this respect investigation has taken a turn which is of little avail in our inquiry. There is a tendency to confound Greek mythology with Greek religion, and explain it by reference to the religion of India. One would be inclined to think that the ancient Greeks marched straight from the Indus to the Achelous with a company of priests and minstrels who immediately set to work to localise their old beliefs in Greece. But though Homer and Hesiod may have ' invented the theogony of the Greeks,' they did not invent their religion. When we set aside the myths which poets altered and invented as they chose, and which therefore present such an open field to the mythologist, and confine ourselves to forms of wor- ship which we know on indubitable evidence to have prevailed in Greece, we shall find that there is not much that is common to Greece and India. No one of course doubts that the Greeks are an Indo-Germanic race, or that they brought certain intuitions with them into their new home. But we must not connect Greece and India too closely. The religion of Greece as we see it in Pausanias is different from the religion of Aryan India. We find in it traces of the worship of stones and trees, and of human sacrifices. It is not the conflict of the gods of light and darkness which is uppermost, but the worship of deities which send the fruits of the earth, Athena, Demeter, and Dionysus. It is difficult to believe without the most cogent evidence that a people of such a lively imagination as the Greeks were always repeating Indian conceptions. Bellerus may be the same as Vritra, and Bellerophontes as Indra, but why should not the Greeks have invented a similar story ? The sets of twin brethren who appear in Greek mythology-Castor and Pollux, Idas and Lvnceus, Zethus and Amphion-are constantly compared with the A9vins of India, but it is difficult to see in what the resem- blance consists. The Hermes of Greek religion is not the mes- senger of the gods, in which capacity he may possibly be compared to Sarameyas, but the giver of luck and prosperity whose ithyphallic statues stood in the streets, and to whom men poured the last libation when retiring to rest at night. In many respects the early religious rites of Greece would seem to have been nearer Semitic than Indo- Germanic forms of worship. Human sacrifices were offered to Athena and Artemis as they were offered to the Syrian Astarte. In the remains discovered at Mycence there is not a single object which can be connected with Indian forms of worship, but there is ample evidence of the presence of deities known to be Semitic. And in the sensualism of which we have an example in the worship of Aphrodite at Corinth, no less than in the anthropomorphism which made manly excellence a form of worship and thus developed the great games, we are far removed from the views of human existence which prevailed in India. When we find Zeus assuming the form of an ant or a bull or a swan, and thus becoming the ancestor of certain families,</page><page sequence="8">424 EARLIEST INVHABITANTS 0OF GREECE July we seem to approach the mode of thought which gives rise to the worship of animals and totemism. There is a suspicious connexion between Artemis and the bear-between the goddess who is ' tender- hearted towards the sucklings of wild beasts' and the animal which is beyond all others devoted to her young. From the point of religion, therefore, we have little reason to deny the presence in Greece of elements which were derived from other than Indian sources. Once more, then, we see how difficult it is to regard the Greeks as the earliest inhabitants of the peninsula, or to look on the nation of the Hellenes as a homogeneous race. On the contrary, the country was probably inhabited from the remotest times by a number of various tribes, some perhaps quite barbarous, others influenced by the civilisation of the east. But owing to some impulse which we cannot now trace, a peculiar spirit grew up among a section of the people, which by this means prevailed over the remainder, and at length developed into a tribe or nation, dis- tinct from the others, and proudly conscious of the distinction. If we ask how the Hellenes became separated from the rest of the Greek tribes, we have to answer, as in the case of the Hebrews and their superiority to other Semitic tribes: by the inspiration of great thoughts. It was impossible that a nation which could create the Hebrew scriptures should remain on the level of the Canaanites or the Phoenicians; and in like manner it was impossible that a nation in which Homeric poetry grew up could become orientalised or remain barbarous. If the early Greeks had had no better poet than Hesiod, they might have sunk under the dominion of a priest- hood; but in Homer the three great principles which constitute Hellenism are already apparent: the love of freedom, the dignity of man, the ethical as opposed to the religious view of life. Whatever the nature of the great monarchies at Tiryns and Mycena3, there is no longer any doubt that the Phcenicians esta- blished themselves in early times on the eastern coast of Greece. Even those who would limit these settlements to trading stations are compelled to admit the 'strong influence' which they exer- cised. Here arises a difficulty which has not been sufficiently noticed with regard to one very important element in the early civilisation of Greece. Does not the presence of the Phoenicians in Greece make it extremely probable that the art of writing was known to the Greeks far earlier than we have been accustomed to allow ? The difficulty which Wolf and Grote raised about writing materials is purely imaginary. Whatever the Phoenicians found to write upon at home, they could easily bring with them and sell to the Greeks, if they required it. In this respect there could be no difficulty whatever. Yet the latest writers on the subject refuse to</page><page sequence="9">1886 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF GREECE 425 carry the antiquity of writing in Greece beyond the eighth century B.C. Kirchhoff maintains that the Greeks first became acquainted with the Phcenician alphabet in Crete, from whence the letters passed to Argos and the peninsula. This, no doubt, is the conclu- sion to which monumental evidence leads us. Though the oldest extant inscriptions are not found in Crete, the oldest forms of the letters are Cretan. But are we compelled to accept monumental evidence? The Phoenicians used two alphabets. Down to a period, which has been fixed at the eleventh century B.C., they used an alphabet, or rather a syllabarium, which was perhaps founded on the cuneiform system in use at Babylon. This alphabet is known to us from inscriptions in Cyprus, where it continued to be in use, even among the Greeks, till the fifth century B.C. Afterwards this system was abandoned for the simple alphabet which is known as the Phoenician-an alphabet derived, it is thought, from the hieratic writing of Egypt. Now it is manifest that the Phcenicians settled in Cyprus before sailing farther west into the Mediterranean, so that if they had an alphabet when settled in Cyprus, they had an alphabet when settled in Greece. Professor Duncker maintains that the Phoenicians did not possess their later alphabet when settled in Greece, but the only reason for the assertion is, that if they had possessed it they would have imparted it to the Greeks; and as they did not impart it, we must conclude that they did not possess it. But if the Phcenicians who landed in Cyprus had a mode of writing, and the nation was so alive to the value of an alphabet that they discarded an old system for a new one, we have no reason to suppose that those Phoenicians who landed in Greece were with- out an alphabet of some kind or another. And, as no certain traces of the Cyprian form of writing have been found to the west of Cyprus, the change in the alphabets must have been made before the traders pushed farther to the west; so that the alphabet which they then possessed was probably their later or second alphabet. If these conclusions are true there is no reason why the Greeks should not have become acquainted with writing long before the eighth century--the earliest date to which the art is now carried back, and beyond which we certainly have no monuments. It is extremely unlikely that the Greeks should have failed to see the value of the invention, and the absence of early monuments is not perhaps so certain a test that writing did not exist as it is supposed to be. It may be mere accident that old registers have perished- as the Kyrbeis of Solon perished when superseded by other docu- ments. The later alphabet of Greece may have, and probably has, displaced an older alphabet; so that the ancient forms of the letters in Crete only prove that some of the Greeks adhered to old forms, while others adopted new-just as in Cyprus they continued to use the old system of writing.</page><page sequence="10">426 EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF" GREECE July Those who argue against the very early existence of writing in Greece, may urge that the uncertainty of early Greek chronology is in itself a proof that it was not derived from written records. Not only do later systems differ considerably in their dates of early events, but even the date of so comparatively recent a matter as the constitution of Lycurgus is given differently in different accounts. Herodotus, too, has recourse to the calculation by genera- tions-a mode of computation which would not have survived to his time, if written records had been in existence for the events which he wishes to fix. The earliest Greek literature exhibits no trace of writing: it is essentially poetical, and writing would inevit- ably be accompanied by the introduction of prose. Those who support the opposite view could reply that early Greek chronology is unsatisfactory to a large extent, because later legends have been designedly introduced into it. How, for instance, can there be a uniform date of the fall of Troy if that incident is a fiction variously related in various legends ? It is very natural that the dates for Lycurgus should differ when reforms differing by many years were ascribed to him. If Herodotus counts by generations, the reason is, that the system affords a rough measure of time which is uni- versally applicable; whereas written records, if based on no common era, would give no such universal measure; we see from Thucy- dides what difficulties may arise from the want of an era for chrono- logical computation. If the earliest Greek literature gives no more than an uncertain hint of the existence of writing, the same may be said of other poems; if there was no prose literature in early times, there was certainly spoken prose, but that was a common form of speech which no one thought worth recording in writing. If we cannot prove that writing was known in Greece earlier than the eighth century, we have at any rate reasons for thinking that it might have been known. And in discussing the evidence of monuments we may remember that there is nothing to prove that writing on monuments was the earliest mode. in which the art was practised. It is true that we find no trace of writing in any of the sites or tombs excavated by Dr. Schliemann with the doubtful exception of Hissarlik. This may prove that writing was unknown, or that it was not employed on vases and other ornaments, as it was at a later time. In any case, nothing is more remarkable than the contrast between the profuse use of writing in Egypt and Mesopo- tamia, and the rarity of it in the west. EVELYN ABBOTT.</page></plain_text>
