<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Place of Rubble in the Trümmerfilm Eric Rentschler Shots of devastated German cities provide stirring vistas in postwar Trümmer- filme (rubble films). As low-angle compositions frame monuments of destruc- tion against the vastness of cloudy skies, the shattered expanses of a depopu- lated metropolis resemble natural landscapes. At times the jagged shards of broken buildings bear an uncanny resemblance to the craggy contours of alpine peaks. But discussion of these often-studied films has rarely granted their most conspicuous shapes and spaces sustained or close attention.1 In fact, rubble plays a prominent role in the Trümmerfilm. The Trümmerfilm, particu- larly the seminal exercise in this vein, Wolfgang Staudte's Die Mörder sind unter uns {The Murderers Are among Us, 1946), also figures in a much larger history of rubble representation. The postwar rubble in Berlin differed from that in Frankfurt, Hamburg, or Dresden. Modern Berlin, notes Wolfgang Schivelbusch, was a city machine in which advanced technology did not simply work over old structures but con- stituted the urban space's prime substance. Unlike other more conventional German cities, Berlin was largely a product of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and for that reason steel skeletons undergirded much of its archi- tecture. The capital's buildings (even its historical edifices from the baroque to the Wilhelminian eras) were so massive that they withstood bombing during 1. Most filmmakers who worked in this vein, submits Kirsten Burghardt, sought to create docu- mentary verisimilitude through realistic images of ruined houses and rubble mountains ("Moralische Wiederaufrüstung im frühen deutschen Nachkriegsfilm," diskurs film 8 [1996]: 243).

The metropolis, reported Isaac Deutscher in September 1945, had been pulverized but not flattened.2 Deci- mated Berlin had both a vertical visage in which towering ruins stretched into the sky and a horizontal one of vast open fields, the so-called steppes.3 In Die Mörder sind unter uns it is the former that dominates. Strictly speaking not a genre, Trümmerfilme are a series of feature films produced in Germany between 1946 and 1949 that confront postwar realities. Using various narrative formulas and styles, these films share a historical situ- ation, a production context, and a political mission. With Germany's film industry out of commission, its studios demolished or seized, and many of its key figures compromised by their Nazi-era activities, the first movies after a year's hiatus (the so-called Filmpause) bore the mark of material shortages and artistic uncertainty. Shot largely on location with restricted amounts of film stock, these productions were closely controlled by the Allied occupi- ers, with different approaches at work in each of the four military zones.4 Trümmerfilme took stock of a shattered nation and registered a state of phys- ical and psychological ruin.5 Exercises in managing shattered identity, the first German features after World War II unevenly blend constructive initiatives and critical agendas. They try to envision a better future and work beyond (if not through) the experiences of the Third Reich, a past that, in crucial regards, refused to go away. Their new designs for living responded to the otherwise grim outlooks of demoral- ized and homeless people. Regardless of the genre format, Germans usually appear as victims or rescuers, rarely as perpetrators.6 Guilt belongs to the par- ties responsible for the misery of average German citizens and the desperate postwar situation. Although Hitler is referred to on occasion, his name is never expressly mentioned in any of the Trümmerfilme. Despite his striking absence, the former leader's legacy is ever present. Exercises in moral rearmament for a population jaded by years of Nazi rule, these tales offer refresher courses in abiding verities and virtues. Above all, argues Gertrud Koch, the Trümmerfilm seeks to foster reconstruction by reinstilling a work ethic and reaffirming dili- 2.

The influence of expressionism marks a departure from the polish of Universum Film AG (UFA) productions under Nazi rule and a recourse to the venerable legacy of Weimar's "haunted screen," with its lighting effects, animated objects, and eccentric angles, as well as its fixation on the mute world of objects and fascination with city streets.8 To be sure, one does find stylistic correspondences in select features from the late Hitler era, exemplars of aesthetic resistance such as Helmut Käut- ner's Romanze in Moll {Romance in a Minor Key, 1943), Große Freiheit Nr. 7 {Great Freedom No. 7, 1944), and Unter den Brücken {Under the Bridges, 1945) and Peter Pewas's Der verzauberte Tag {The Enchanted Day, 1944), somber mood pieces atypical of the period in which disaffected individuals seek a better life outside the community.9 Neorealism adds an international dimension to what we might otherwise think of as the cycle's German Sonder- weg (unique approach). There is a common penchant for location shooting (similar to many early film noirs that probe the subterranean reaches and noc- turnal haunts of urban spaces) and a shared emphasis on the facts of empirical existence and on the importance of human solidarity. Both Trümmerfilme and neorealist productions reflect the belief that a changed world demands new ways of seeing and different means of representation. Contemporary debates repeatedly contrasted the Trümmerfilm, a cin- ema grounded in reality, with the Traumfabrik (dream factory). The designa- tion Trümmerfilm, lamented Käutner, all too quickly became an epithet. This, he elaborated, was the sorry result of unwillingness among German audiences to accept films about the aporias of their history.10 On January 4, 1947, an arti- cle appeared in Der Spiegel under the title "Stimmen aus Parkett und Rang: Man mag keine Ruinen" ("Voices from the Orchestra and the Balcony: People 7.

With such an abundance of grim prospects in daily life, why should depressing images also occupy the precious few spaces reserved for German art?11 Postwar filmgoers eschewed Trümmerfilme for Hollywood features (both reprises and new releases) as well as evergreens from the Nazi era. In Film ohne Titel {Film without a Title, 1948) a scriptwriter describes the iconography of a Trümmerfilm ("Dusk. Ruins from below. Pan. A bar in the ruins") as we see the obligatory askew angles, harsh lighting contrasts, and run- down spaces. The passage, based on Käutner's script, affords a self-conscious parody. By 1949 commentators declared that the age of the Trümmerfilm had passed. During the subsequent decade, rubble would all but vanish from the screens of German cinemas. Even though a host of documentaries made in East Germany right after 1945 had chronicled life amid the rubble,12 Staudte's film was the first postwar Ger- man feature to do so. "Berlin, 1945," reads the opening image of Die Mörder sind unter uns. "The city has capitulated." The narrative relates the home- coming of a broken man to a broken city. Hans Mertens, a shell-shocked for- mer soldier, lacks the desire to resume work as a physician and get on with his life. How can a landscape of rubble become a site of Heimat (home) for this depleted Heimkehrer (one returning home)? Hans shares an apartment with Susanne Wallner, who has spent time in a concentration camp but has some- how emerged with a fresh outlook. Unlike Hans, she seems all but unburdened by her past experiences. In a series of flashbacks, the source of his malaise becomes initially audible and in the end fully visible. He cannot forget the brutal murder of innocent men, women, and children in Poland on Christmas Eve 1942, an act of violence that he protested but ultimately witnessed in silence. When he learns that the man responsible for the massacre, Captain Bruckner, is thriving as a prosperous factory owner, Hans reacts with rage and despair. The specter of the past, in the form of traumatic memories and the presence of a murderer, debilitates him and prevents him from finding happi- ness with Susanne. Only her last-minute intervention will prevent him from taking revenge on his former tormentor.13 11. "Stimmen aus Parkett und Rang: Man mag keine Ruinen," Der Spiegel, January 4, 1947. 12.

Staudte's original scenario was toned down by the Soviet sector's cultural attaché. The script had ended with Mertens hunting down and killing a war criminal; the revised ending demanded that the guilty be called to justice without permitting the hero to fulfill his homicidal desire.</page><page sequence="5">Eric Rentschier 13 Staudte's scenario stemmed from a wartime experience. An SS officer had called him a "communist pig" and threatened to kill him. What would hap- pen, Staudte wondered after the war, if he were to meet the man now? Staudte circulated his script among the cultural attachés of the four occupying powers.14 After rejections from officials in the British and American zones, Staudte finally found support from the Soviets. Even though he was not a communist, his unabashed hatred for the Nazis echoed the Russian antifascist resolve.15 As a result, the first postwar German film was made in the Soviet sector and bore the imprimatur of the DEFA studio. It premiered in Berlin on October 15, 1946, fourteen days after the convictions of twenty-two major war criminals in Nuremberg and a week before the resulting twelve executions were to be carried out.16 Over six million people saw the film, and it would go on to be screened in twenty-three countries,17 which was unusual, as most Trümmer- filme did not travel abroad and, when they did, they did not travel well. Many German critics lauded the film as a pathbreaking endeavor; one described it as a work that brought the viewer face-to-face with "German real- ity, our reality" and offered a tour "through our clouded psychic landscape."18 Commentators also praised the film for its return to the legacy of Weimar cin- ema.19 Friedel Behn-Grund, the cinematographer, received commendations for his stunning compositions and use of chiaroscuro. Most reviewers granted that the film was a noteworthy effort even if they found reasons to fault it. For Wolfdietrich Schnurre, the work was a failure: instead of directly confronting reality, Staudte diverted attention from the true state of things with heavy- handed symbols. Nonetheless, the critic concluded, Die Mörder sind unter uns marked a bold start.20 Subsequent commentators, especially since the 1960s, have faulted the Trümmerfilm for its fuzzy universalism and maudlin self-pity, 14. An alternative title used in the early screenings of the film was Der Mann, den ich töten werde. 15. Egon Netenjakob, "Ein Leben gegen die Zeit: Versuch über WS," in Staudte, ed.

The majority of East and West German features from 1946 to 1951, submits Thomas Brandlmeier, are more successful in disclosing mental and spiritual residue than in probing German history.21 This is not to say that these films fail to confront the past. A large number of them in fact flash back to the war years. (With the exception of Staudte's Rotation, however, there is next to no reference to the prewar phase of the Third Reich.)22 These acts of retro- spection are selective in their terms of remembrance; more often than not, they beg questions of responsibility and pay little attention to the true victims of Ger- man violence.23 By and large, the Trümmerfilm is more concerned with moving forward, with reconstructing the nation rather than reconsidering its past. In crucial regards, the rhetoric of Trümmerfilm criticism anticipates W. G. Sebald's "Air War and Literature," particularly his objection that German authors aestheticized the aftermath of aerial attacks instead of carefully regis- tering "the true state of material and moral ruin in which the country found itself."24 The remnants of destruction from the war's closing years, rather than fathomed directly and palpably, are filtered through the "half-consciousness or false consciousness" of writers 'primarily concerned with resuming their careers. Sebald celebrates exceptions to the rule like Hans Erich Nossack and Alexander Kluge, whose work focuses on the cataclysmic results of what he terms "the natural history of destruction." The latter notion is, without ques- tion, strangely at odds with Sebald's own call for a dispassionate chronicle of "real conditions."25 For all his insistence on soberly attending to signs of violence, Sebald's natural history of destruction fixes on a state of annihilation that appears to be the work of natural forces instead of human agents. This diversion of the gaze resembles what Sebald in another context castigates as "looking and looking away at the same time."26 Such a shift of focus is quite common in the Trümmerfilm. One film produced right after the war scrutinized the rubble of Berlin at length and spared the viewer metaphorical contrivances. Ein Tag im Juli (A 21. Brandlmeier, "Von Hitler zu Adenauer," 34.

Extended tracking shots capture ground-level panoramas of wasted residential build- ings in front of which women clear away debris. A long take traverses the Kur- fürstendamm, passing by the bombed-out shells of former businesses and checking out pedestrians dressed up for an afternoon walk before stopping in front of a Café Kranzler that has seen far better days. We glimpse a clock at the Bahnhof Zoo stuck at two minutes to twelve. Protracted aerial views, from a camera placed where bombs once rested, reveal a former capital that resembles a phantom zone. The American plane soars over streets and build- ings, just as Hitler's aircraft had a decade earlier in its approach to Nurem- berg at the start of Triumph des Willens {Triumph of the Will, 1935). The Allied camera claims this landscape for the victors, reworking prominent German documentaries from the Weimar and Nazi eras and in the process updating German history. The opening minutes of Billy Wilder's Foreign Affair (1948) also repli- cate Hitler's descent from the clouds to the Nazi Party Congress. We even see a plane, like the Nazi leader's, cast a shadow over the city. The sequence takes stock of German destruction, reviewing a barren landscape, while American politicians discuss the alternative futures of the Morgenthau and the Marshall Plan. "They ought to scrape it plumb clean, put in some grass, and move in a herd of longhorns," says one congressman. "I say build up their industries and get those smokestacks belching again," responds a colleague. At once looking back and looking ahead, Wilder, an emigrant from Germany and an American occupation officer, self-consciously mimics the celestial prologue of Triumph des Willens, replacing Leni Riefenstahl's camera and Hitler's gaze with a regard in equal measure awestruck and constructive.28 Nazi Kulturfilme (documentary shorts) celebrated architectural grandeur and hailed Germany's cities of the future; the era's features rarely included footage of war ruins. Trümmerfilme frankly exhibited what wartime movies by and large had sought to conceal: the amount of destruction caused by Allied aerial attacks. Die grosse Liebe {The Great Love) was unusual for a film of 1942 in that it acknowledged nocturnal air raids and showed life in bomb 27. The film is available as a special feature on the DVD version of Irmgard von zur Mühlen's Berlin Ruine 1945 -Metropole 2000 (Berlin: Chronos-Media, 2000). 28.

The protagonists of Käutner's musical, Wir machen Musik (We're Making Music, 1942), turn to viewers at the film's end and remind people to darken their windows. In Die Deggenhardts (The Deggenhardts, 1944), a fam- ily from northern Germany closes ranks and stands steady as the war takes its toll on the home front. The final sequence contains elaborate images of destroyed buildings and churches in Lübeck after a particularly severe air raid in March 1942. More typical of the time, however, was Veit Harlan's Opfergang (Ride of Sacrifice, 1944), which begins with picturesque prospects of an intact Ham- burg, which stood in dramatic contrast to the shattered city in which the film would be screened. Gerhard Huttula, a UFA studio technician responsible for back projection, found his services increasingly in demand. If German film- makers wanted to do a scene in a train compartment against an urban back- ground, Huttula would be called on to provide special effects in the form of Rückprobilder (back projections), which might sustain the illusion of an intact world. "The more that war devastated Germany, the more Huttula's division became important for UFA."29 In the war's final phase Joseph Goebbels commissioned a UFA pro- duction on an immense scale, modeled on Gone with the Wind (1939) and Mrs. Miniver (1942). The only way to mobilize a shell-shocked populace, believed the minister at this desperate moment, was to bring people face-to- face with the harsh facts of reality. Das Leben geht weiter (Life Goes On) celebrated the unbroken will of German families despite the horror and devas- tation of daily air attacks. From the fall of 1944 to the spring of 1945, the direc- tor, Wolfgang Liebeneiner, worked on what was to be a paean for total war. Although no footage remains, the existing storyboards offer vivid tableaux of vast destruction. The script's closing sequence relates how "from these ruins, life will begin anew." We see burned tram cars, torn electricity cables, col- lapsed bridges, and a bombed-out train station. People clad in torn and shred- ded clothing walk down the street wearing goggles and gas masks. In this endeavor Huttula was sent out to capture location footage of the immense damage. According to the cameraman Günther Anders, Liebeneiner tried to hide the footage of Goebbels's grand Trümmerfilm so that after the war it could be transformed into an anti-Nazi production. Many years later Kluge and Peter Schamoni made Brutalität in Stein (Brutality in Stone, 1961), a twelve-minute film that contrasts the decayed rem- 29.

This short documentary recollects shards and reflections of a collective dream, juxtaposing the fragments of today with the immodest designs of Nazi city planners, refashioning historical debris into a deconstructed museum of memories. Kluge's Trümmerfilm is a parody of a Nazi Kulturfilm, it begins with a shot from Kurt Rupli's Das Wort aus Stein {The Word of Stone, 1939) and ends with images of building material, rocks, and ruin. These views reveal what is left of the fascist legacy and, in so doing, poignantly enact Theodor W. Adorno's project of dealing with memories of offense and catastrophe by working through them. Adorno's famous radio lecture of 1959, "Was bedeutet Aufarbeitung der Ver- gangenheit?" ("What Does Coming to Terms with the Past Mean?"), reflected on Germany's still-unresolved relation to the legacy of National Socialism. Have German attempts at public enlightenment, he asked, truly succeeded in addressing a legacy of shame? Or has the insistence on revisiting history been met only with stubborn resistance?31 The German survivors of World War II faced the formidable task of refurbishing themselves and their national community. As agents and symptoms of this reinvention of Germany, Trüm- merfilme remain historical artifacts, cinematic counterparts to the postwar era's philosophical "panoramas of cataclysm," particularly the influential interventions of Friedrich Meinecke and Karl Jaspers.32 These cinematic sce- narios, in keeping with popular sentiment, reaffirmed Meinecke's belief that fate had brought to Germany a great catastrophe. They surely did not support Jaspers's conviction that Germans needed, with all due rigor and integrity, to acknowledge and atone for Nazi misdeeds. 30. Rubble figures strongly in postwar features by such noteworthy international directors as Leo Lindtberg, Akira Kurosawa, Carol Reed, Andrzej Wajda, and Alain Resnais. 31. Theodor W.

Additional important postwar prospects include Martin Heidegger's "Letter on Humanism" (1947), Erich Fromm's Man for Himself (1947), and Max Picard's Hitler in Our Selves (1947). Numerous literary texts also addressed the burden of German guilt, as did a host of cultural digests, such as Der Aufbau, Der Ruf and Die Wandlung.</page><page sequence="10">18 Rubble in the Trümmerfilm German culture, maintained Meinecke, had emerged from the war funda- mentally intact, despite "the monstrous experiences which fell to our lot in the twelve years of the Third Reich."33 The central project of postwar reconstruc- tion would be to revitalize the venerable heritage of Geist, to restore culture and religion, to create societies of Goethe venerators that might convey "the most vital evidences of the German spirit" (120). Meinecke tells how a "frightful catastrophe" (1) burst on a noble nation. In Hitler, an "unholy man," "there lay something foreign to us Germans and very difficult to understand" (58). Pre- cisely because Hitler and the Nazis represented an "extraneous factor in the course of history" (57), Germany still retained, despite what had happened, a sound culture that could not be held responsible for the misdeeds of a small circle of criminals. As did the Trümmerfilme, Meinecke emphasized the Ger- man vicissitudes that came in the wake of apocalyptic events. Here, too, we find a contrast between the many who have suffered and the guilty few who have caused the suffering. Indeed, Meinecke distinguishes between the healthy "we" and the murderous "they"- in other words, the murderers were among us. Speaking from a different perspective, Jaspers declared that Germans could not simply banish the shadow of the past.34 How, though, might a "pariah people" revive itself, particularly if all that Germans now have in common are negative features? How is a gathering of helpless and atomized individuals ever to become a community (18)? People in distress, he noted, want to find hope and comfort, not to hear about the past and be burdened with guilt (27). In his insistence that all Germans pose the question of their guilt and answer it forthrightly, Jaspers represented a rare voice. During the war virtually every- one suffered losses of family and friends, Jaspers acknowledged, but how one lost them resulted in greatly different inner attitudes. Contrary to Mei- necke's Manichaeanism, Jaspers saw substantial distinctions among those who had suffered, depending on the conditions of their suffering. Nonetheless, he posited a community of victims who shared a common situation and faced similar challenges. How is one to remake the world, and on what basis, when everything seems tainted and poisoned (114)? There was a catastrophe (here, too, Jaspers's perspective is fundamentally at odds with that of Meinecke), and for it Germans bear the greatest responsibility. As individuals, Jaspers maintained, 33.

We should question ourselves, should pitilessly analyze ourselves: where did I feel wrongly, think wrongly, act wrongly- we should, as far as possible, look for guilt within ourselves, not in things, nor in the others; we should not dodge into distress. (114-15) The Trümmerfilme issued from the same state of emergency that had produced Jaspers's call for ethical, moral, and political renewal. Nonetheless, the vast body of Trümmerfilme, like their German audiences, ignored Jaspers's proposals. The protagonists of these features do not assume responsibility for the past; instead, they view themselves as objects subject to higher pow- ers. "We can't do anything," says a figure in Rolf Meyer's Zugvögel {Migrating Birds, 1947); "things simply happen to us." These films employ a jargon of authenticity that enlists an impersonal destiny as time's driving force and in so doing disavows the subjective factor in history. "I saw a few people," says the voice-over narrator of Käutner's In jenen Tagen {In Those Days, 1947). "The times were stronger than they were, but their humanity was stronger than the times." The temporal and geographic indeterminacy of titles- Irgendwo in Berlin {Somewhere in Berlin, 1946), Zwischen Gestern und Morgen {Between Yesterday and Tomorrow, 1947), Und über uns der Himmel {And the Sky above Us, 1947)- likewise corresponds to the cycle's larger retreat from the disturb- ing topographies of recent experience.35 Meinecke's blend of fatalism and exis- tentialism was the preferred response to the catastrophic state of things; Jas- pers's call for critical self-reflection and exhaustive soul-searching remained most decidedly a minority opinion. As reflections and symptoms of a spiritual wasteland, Trümmerfilme were anything but singular. The tangible presence of ruins dominated postwar urban life in Germany and was a frequent object of such photographers and painters as August Sander, Henry Ries, Max Baur, Richard Peter, and Ewald Gnilka. And these images sparked heated debate. Heinz Liidecke's Marxist intervention of 1948 in the East German journal Bildende Kunst, for instance, 35. Brandlmeier, "Von Hitler zu Adenauer," 33. "The creation of a culture of redemption," submits Robert Shandley, "was the initial and perhaps primary work" of the Trümmerfilme (Rubble Films: German Cinema in the Shadow of the Third Reich [Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001], 182). See also Elliot Stein's assessment of Die Mörder sind unter uns in "Rubble Indemni- ties," Village Voice, April 10, 2002: "An uneasy mix of shadowy expressionism and doc [documen- tary] verisimilitude, this stark film offers little in the way of political analysis, although its moral indignation is somewhat convincing."</page><page sequence="12">20 Rubble in the Trümmerfilm considered how photography might represent ruins in an appropriate and a responsible way. Baur's "Schlossruine in Potsdam" ("Palace Ruins in Pots- dam"), Lüdecke complained, turns heaps of ruins into a romantic vista. Leaves flutter in the wind and clouds billow in Baur's atmospheric panorama of a shat- tered palace. The tableau, anachronistic in its painterly grandeur, transmutes history into a fetish object by concentrating on fragments and not providing a sense of the larger whole, that is, the Prussian militarism and German war that spawned this image. (These thoughts bring to mind Susan Sontag's larger concern about how "our very sense of situation is ... articulated by the cam- era's interventions," which may well disarm our historical judgment.)36 Like the film theorist Bela Balázs, Lüdecke stresses the importance of the Einstel- lung, a word that at once connotes a frame, a mental attitude, and a worldview. The correct Einstellung is the appropriate fix on things; it is equally a formal and a moral disposition. When images of what is {Abbilder) yield to meta- phorical semblances (Sinnbilder), we gain art but lose reality. A photographer needs to remain sober and find the proper relationship, both spatially and intellectually, to what stands before the camera.37 How might one best describe Staudte's Einstellung vis-à-vis the rubble of Berlin? A well-known image from the opening sequence of Die Mörder sind unter uns comes to mind, a glimpse at a phantomlike facade framed by a cloudy sky (3:40).38 This spellbinding take seems to represent what Sebald castigates as "the temptation to make the real horrors of the time disappear through the artifice of abstraction and metaphysical fraudulence."39 Anyone who transforms the remnants of destruction into an aesthetic reverie lies, argues Lüdecke, because this rubble is a sign of violence caused by German aggression: "The consequences of World War II are neither idyllic nor roman- tic."40 Similarly, Sebald rails against "the construction of aesthetic or pseudo- aesthetic effects from the ruins of an annihilated world." Like Lüdecke, he lauds approaches that are concrete and documentary rather than abstract and imaginary, that provide a sense of "the facts that stare straight at us in the lan- guage of those professionally involved in the horror."41 36.

As the back of the edifice gives way, the facade remains standing. Swirling dust imparts a frisson to the fractured structure, shrouding it in a haze that renders the background barely visible. "No stage decorator," to recall a reproach from Lüdecke's essay, "could have done it more effectively."42 Staudte's camera, remarked the film critic Werner Fiedler, "creates stirringly beautiful landscapes of ruins." In the process, "incredible painterly effects come into view. ... A wall collapses- hopes fall to pieces. Clouds tower over the ruins- difficult memories darken a countenance. One stumbles, fumbles, and staggers between images and symbols."43 A contemporary report described how Staudte had combed Berlin for the location with the most arresting ruins. Happening on a devastated block that made an especially striking impression, he instructed laborers working on a burst water pipe there "not to wreck any- thing."44 One image stands out in Ries's collection of Berlin postwar photo- graphs because of what the artist considered its uncharacteristically surreal look. The nocturnal view of rubble with contours and corridors of light in fact derives from Staudte's film set.45 Contemporary critics like Friedrich Luft attacked Staudte's images for their conspicuous symbolism. The director, maintained Luft, should have spared viewers metaphors cloaked in shadows and been more concerned with capturing scenes of clarity and verisimilitude.46 Yet later commentators have not followed Luft and regarded the film's often-noted meeting of expres- sionism and neorealism as a potential conflict of interests, as a formal ten- sion between the desire to probe the secrets of the soul and the wish to pic- ture everyday life amid the ruins. André Bazin praised neorealism because it stripped away expressionism and eschewed montage, granting viewers "a sense of the ambiguity of reality." Although all cinema involves some level of artifice, neorealism, rather than imposing meaning, exercises a formal restraint that allows the world to retain its integrity and richness.47 All things considered, Staudte's formal approach has little in common with neorealism. 42.

Rather than redeem reality, the Trümmerfilm stylizes and transfigures it. Architectural discourses right after the war, according to Schivelbusch, elab- orated how, in a reverse dialectic, the destruction of Berlin might give rise to new configurations that would bring the city and country together. Martin Wagner, for instance, imagined that the former metropolis could become a homeland, a synthesis of Stadt- Land- Kultur, of modernity and nature.48 Ber- lin's rubble might be understood to signify a vanquished modernity, except that the modernity of the former asphalt city was brought down by the moder- nity of war technology. At first glance, Staudte's film, in keeping with the back- ward movement of the natural history of destruction, seems to retreat from modernity and recast the ruins of the city machine as an atmospheric spectacle with the sublime grandeur of towering, ice-capped peaks. Staudte's Trümmerbilder contain more than a trace of baroque vanitas in their implied contrast between former greatness and present devastation; there is also something altogether romantic in their evocation of Stimmung (atmo- sphere) and the uncanny. They are, as Peter Schjeldahl has said of paintings by Caspar David Friedrich, "shuddery pleasures, laced with something cold and weird."49 No question, they are aestheticized, at times downright symbolic or allegorical. This does not mean, as Lüdecke might charge, that they remain incapable of making German history visible. Annie Bourneuf has shown compelling links between Friedrich's romantic landscapes and Sander's post- war photographs of a vanquished Cologne. Consciously echoing Friedrich's Rückenfigur (figure seen from behind), Sander often aligns the spectator's gaze, either overtly or by suggestion, with a vantage point that peers at the city from the top of a fractured edifice. The spatial position of an ethical watcher who looks out over the ruins of war corresponds to the temporal position of a wit- ness or a judge. In their sharp, even hyperreal, focus on the details of destruc- tion, Sander's cityscapes (like Friedrich's landscapes) present themselves as the function of a singular vision. In Bourneuf 's estimation, they "draw atten- tion to the seer and lead the viewer to align himself with this seer."50 The symmetries in Staudte's view of the shards of buildings described above are anything but arbitrary. They are a function of an aesthetic choice that also has determined the placement of the viewer: the director employs com- 48. Schivelbusch, Vor dem Vorhang, 30. 49.

The image in question is preceded by a glimpse of a poster, an element that initially does not stand out in the busy long shot of a crowded waiting room. The camera, with great emphasis, narrows on the image and renders it the key focus of compositional attention, framing it doubly, between the blasted- out windows and human presences that appear on both sides. The two figures, an old refugee and a crippled returned soldier, recede and allow for an unob- structed view. The poster's vertical composition finally assumes center stage before segueing into a matched dissolve of the rubble ridges. This transition, although visually seamless, is aurally disjunctive. The crash of cymbals pro- vides the sonic equivalent of an exclamation point. The rubble appears like a barren ridge of mountains: unpeopled and atmospheric, neither foreground nor background separated by a middle space, the jagged shards of edifices neatly framed in a medium long shot from a low angle. One shard assumes the center of the composition, and on each side we see three smaller shards, in a symme- try reminiscent of Friedrich's work with its blend of the made and the found. In gravitating toward the tourist poster of Nuremberg that bears the cap- tion "Das schöne Deutschland" (Beautiful Germany), the camera turns the viewer's focus to an artifact of Heimat discourse. As a reminder of the site of the Nazi party rallies and a recollection of shots from Triumph des Willens, it becomes an overdetermined ideological signifier. The camera dissolves from a tight view of this idealized vision of former glory to an image of an altogether different Germany, presenting a harsh history lesson and a causal relationship that are underscored by a percussive touch- as if to say that these lies caused these results. That the view of rubble has a distinct beauty of its own does not subtract from its disturbing quality; if anything, the majesty of the image heightens the stark irony of the contrast. The subsequent course of German film history, at least in the Federal Republic, dramatically reversed the sequence of these two images, in effect negating the emphatic critique inherent in the jarring clash between their before-and-after views. The Trümmerfilm's panoramas of destruction with their spiritual void and material lack yielded to the Heimatfilm's more sooth- ing countryside panoramas. The features of the Adenauer era took leave of the Trümmerfilm's Albträume (nightmares) and embraced the Alpenträume (alpine visions) of a Beautiful Germany. Bleak prospects of a world without shelter gave way to a vast abundance of homeland films in the 1950s with their intact communities, pastoral havens, and flourishing cottage industries. Enact- ing the structured opposition between the terms Zusammenbruch (collapse) and Neubau (reconstruction), homeland films functioned as celluloid Neubauten,</page><page sequence="16">24 Rubble in the Trümmerfilm temporary domiciles, mass-produced and quickly created for displaced and disfranchised masses.51 The opening shot of Die Mörder sind unter uns presents a skewed glimpse of an apparently inebriated Hans walking down a path between mounds of refuse and mountains of ruins (1:20). In the foreground stands a grave, behind which we see children playing- reminders of the wages of war coexisting with ener- getic signs of life. The compositional tension anticipates the film's dilemma: how is one to shape a future amid this present and in the face of such a disas- trous past? Hans pauses for a second and turns around before entering Das moderne Cabaret (The Modern Cabaret), a sanctuary that promises Tanz Stimmung Humor (dancing, atmosphere, fun), a deferral of present challenges and an escape from past horrors (2:10). The film's point of departure portrays a detour into alcoholic abandon, sexual indulgence, and honky-tonk music. Already in the film's initial image, rubble assumes the double guise of a commanding physical presence and an objective correlative for a man who is a virtual wreck. In this regard, rubble functions like the imposing mountains of the Bergfilm (mountain film) that, as Balázs points out, possess the distinct physiognomies of "living companions."52 In Der heilige Berg (The Holy Moun- tain, 1926), the climber Robert witnesses his best friend embraced by the woman of his dreams and reacts with shock and fury. An alpine landscape blows up on the screen as an externalized reflection of his mental turmoil, a psychic eruption caused by the radical gap between an overpowering experi- ence and the virtual breakdown of a human psyche that is unable to fathom this immensity. Rubble, likewise, becomes a character in its own right that is linked to a human drama and the narrative trajectory. A close-up of Hans accompanies subjective sounds that replay his experiences of war and destruc- tion. As the camera dissolves to an image of rats and ruins (45:34), Hans's face and eyes spill over into the rubblescape. The camera tilts up from the rodents 51. In the German Democratic Republic Trümmerfilme quickly gave way to the constructive designs of DEFA's antifascist retroscenarios. In some noteworthy cases (particularly the films of Konrad Wolf), these productions offered differentiated tableaux of people between the fronts faced with hard political and moral choices. In less estimable and more typical instances, socialist-realist orthodoxy became a form of state surrealism; films remade the world in the shape of heroic Potem- kin villages that commingled what J. Hoberman has termed "strict idealization and naive, almost goofy idealism" (The Red Atlantis: Communist Culture in the Absence of Communism [Philadel- phia: Temple University Press, 1998], 16). 52.

In this Trümmerfilm rubble is more than just metaphorical or symbolic; it is often anthropomorphic. Painfully dejected, utterly uninvested, unable to love or work, plagued by disgust and nausea, Hans enters the film as a textbook example of Freudian melancholy. The camera frequently shows him walking through the rubble, a realm of the abject in which he, viewing himself as a pariah, seems far more at ease than in Susanne's flat. At one point the camera tilts up to reveal Hans's disheveled silhouette and the ravaged building above him, as if the two shapes were parts of a whole (18:56). Hans is a prodigal son come back to Germany, but he has not found a place to call home. "Did I say I felt comfortable here?" he snaps at Susanne. "House, house!" he screams at Mondschein. "Cracks in the walls! Holes in the floor, the windows all boarded up, and the water drip- ping all the way down to the cellar." He is ruined because his mind is shattered; his traumatic experience in Poland has fundamentally altered his personality. His harrowing past reappears in a series of flashbacks, memory fragments that the audience, drawing on its own collective experience, is called on to piece together. The film's initial sequence also shows a second return. Susanne (the role made Hildegard Knef famous) emerges from a train station, a ray of light amid a dark mass of distraught refugees and displaced persons (3:00). Released from a concentration camp, where she has spent the last three years of the war, she makes a beeline for her former residence, her makeup intact and her spirits undaunted. No sooner has she reoccupied her apartment than she goes to work clearing away the debris (22:13). For her, the past is not an issue; she is willing and able to leave it behind.53 From the beginning, her movements and gaze are directed to what is before her. For Hans, her flatmate, the past is a disease; it afflicts him like a merciless virus. Susanne seeks to comprehend his disaffec- tion by piecing together the fragments of his disturbing memories.54 She dis- covers and delivers the letter that reestablishes Hans's link to Bruckner and the wartime act of violence. When she chances on Hans's journal, she realizes why he seeks revenge against his former superior officer. The facilitator of the memory work that will enable Hans to confront and overcome the cause of his melancholy, she also intervenes and appeals to his ethical conscience. Hans's 53. On her return she says to Mondschein, "It's so hard to forget," but this is her sole reference to wartime hardship. 54.

Interrupting the attempt on Bruckner's life, Susanne calls Hans to order: "We have no right to pass sentence." His shadow recedes (78:55), and, now restored, he agrees with her, adding that "we have the obligation to call the guilty to justice, to demand atonement on behalf of millions of inno- cent people who were murdered." The mission of the Trümmerfilm lay in clearing away the rubble, restoring human agency, and creating the conditions for a future community. Toward that end and in a striking recast of the classical myth, Susanne plays a Eury- dice who guides her Orpheus back to the world of the living.55 (Egon Neten- jakob aptly likens her to "an angel that returns unscathed from a KZ [concen- tration camp].")56 In the film's opening sequence, she walks past a shattered statue of a mother and child, untainted and mute witnesses of war's violence (3:53). She, who will make posters redolent of Käthe Kollwitz's work that pro- claim "Save the children!" like the Pietà, is an innocent victim of unseen forces. Unlike Hans, she will never again stand under the sway of the rubble during the film. An angel of history in reverse, she has none of the awe and horror of her counterpart in Walter Benjamin's work, because her gaze points in the opposite direction: her aim is to escape a bad history, and, in Staudte's narra- tive, no blast from the past will impede her progress. The eyes of this "woman in white" focus on the road ahead.57 A decidedly uneven and gendered division of labor governs the film's vision of German reconstruction: for the couple (and, by extension, a new civil society) to form itself, the broken man must look back to exorcise the images of horror that haunt and possess him. History becomes a male problem, and woman serves as the midwife who delivers man from its burden. Literally and figuratively a Trümmerfrau, Susanne clears away the rubble, both the bombing debris in the flat she shares with Hans and the residue of the war in her lover's psyche. Hans's working through the past certainly has little to do with what Jaspers or Adorno had in mind. The film makes visible what he cannot bear to see but needs to see if he is to restore himself, resume work as a physician, and become a husband. At issue is a German war crime (the thirty-six men, fifty- 55.

The deaths that he beholds are not his doing, but the act of violence torments him- particularly the feeling of shame that he was present while crimes were committed in the name of Germany. He is decidedly not one of the murderers; the distinction is anticipated in the title and essential to the film's project. Hans looks back at the past and reckons with the guilty party in order that he might salvage his better self. The telos of the narrative is for Susanne and Hans to take leave of the past so that they might occupy a rubble-free future. This hopeful prospect is rehearsed in a night scene where the couple walks through a passage of ruins, the ridges of structures in the background carefully lit to provide the most striking impression (35:30). First viewed in long shot, the figures stroll toward the camera, providing both at the level of composition and perspective exact antipodes to the Rückenfiguren of Sander's rubble photographs. Hans and Susanne, having progressed to the foreground, look offscreen and up toward the spectator. They step ever closer to the camera, until their bodies finally blot out the rubble and take over the frame (36:30).58 As the characters extricate themselves from the ruins, Hans articulates the hope of once again becoming a whole person, capable of love. This dream of restoration, both of living spaces and of human minds and bodies, is the Trümmer film's manifest destiny, a fan- tasy of an intact national corpus that will, of course, find its definitive incarna- tion in the Heimatfilm. The vast majority of postwar German feature productions, as commenta- tors have often noted, rarely acknowledged the Holocaust. Only a small num- ber of Trümmerfilme, in keeping with overarching Allied directives meant to foster cooperation and minimize resentment among an occupied populace, would speak of the Shoah or portray victims of the camps.59 Rather than sim- ply fault German filmmakers for their many oversights and lapses in this regard, however, future scholars might want to consider more carefully, case by case, the significant role played by Allied occupiers in filtering and even censor- ing the Trümmerfilm's images of the Nazi past. Staudte's feature contains a sequence that, in the context of subsequent domestic productions during the 58. See the film script in Peter Pleyer, Deutscher Nachkriegsfilm, I946-1948 (Münster: Fahle, 1965), 181: Susanne and Hans walk toward the camera until they fill the frame space and the ruins in the background are no longer visible. 59.

A stark image of silhouetted ruins against a cloudy sky fades to a newspaper headline seen in close-up at the frame's center: "2 Million People Gassed," and below, "Report from a Concentration Camp in Auschwitz" (49:58). The two shots confront the viewer with the inescapable facts of Ger- man history (both the site and the report of a crime) while inscribing the on-screen perspective of a perpetrator indifferent to the awful truth. The cam- era tilts up to a medium frontal close-up of Bruckner, who, in a take that lasts a full twenty seconds, eats his lunch with gusto, blissfully oblivious to the news- paper in front of him, a mere wrapper for his sandwich. Bruckner does not see the headline, nor does he want to take notice of the rubble. He later complains about its irritating ugliness, insisting that "the best way to get to know it is to ignore it." Like Hans, Bruckner is a Heimkehrer. But unlike Hans, he feels at home precisely because neither physical nor psychic ruins have a place in his prosperous new existence. Bruckner embodies the unwillingness to mourn, which is not to say that he has no memories; he fondly recalls "the golden days of freedom in a gray uniform." Owner of a flourishing factory that recycles steel helmets into pots and pans, he anticipates the psychopathology of the economic wonder that never looks back but instead occupies itself, in the words of Alexander and Margarethe Mitscherlich, with the "expansion and modernization of our indus- trial potential, right down to the kitchen utensils."60 He is, in the double sense of the word, shameless: he feels no shame, and he has no shame. Confronted with his murders, he insists that he is innocent while the camera places him behind bars and the music indicts him. He is condemned both visually and aurally while Hans is exonerated. By working through his trauma and relin- quishing his desire for revenge, Hans comes to recognize himself as a victim and to dissociate himself from the perpetrator. For that reason, his final words can assume the moral high ground of a responsible citizen speaking in the name of those who have suffered unjustly. The final procession of victims of the past consists of an old woman, two children, and two wounded German soldiers. There is no indication of Jews or any non-German victims, neither here nor in the closing vista of graves and crosses. Staudte's film was far less unsettling than Die Todesmühlen {Death Mills, 1945), an Allied documentary that put German atrocities on view and was circulated widely in 1946 to impress on the German people their nation's 60.

According to Aleida Assmann, these stark images made it impossible for Germans (even if they dismissed the film as Allied propaganda) to disavow or ignore the reality of the camps.62 Die Todes- mühlen compiled and publicized incontrovertible evidence of violence and genocide committed under German auspices. Mandatory screenings of the film, Assmann argues, catalyzed a trauma among the nation's citizens- a func- tion of their shame and not their guilt.63 This trauma was less a response to murders committed by Germans than a reaction to the fact that the film had made unspeakable war crimes a matter of public record and in so doing had exposed and shamed the German nation.64 "Our disgrace," remarked Thomas Mann, "stands in open view before the eyes of the world."65 Die Mörder sind unter uns acknowledges German war crimes, but, unlike Die Todesmühlen, it denies any collective German culpability for these crimes. Even the Trümmer- films most acerbic revisitation of the Nazi experience, which Staudte's film arguably is, seems most noteworthy for the still-resonant way in which it both delimits and reframes the question of German guilt by focusing on the effects of German suffering. Die Morder sind unter uns resonates differently and strongly in light of Sebald's essay and the recent revival of interest in German wartime and post- war hardship. Thus the film is hardly dated; it remains, in fact, quite topical. It does not so much describe as reshape and stylize Germany's "state of material and moral ruin" (in Sebald's words) in the hope that it might be overcome. (For that reason, the customary comparison with the verism of neorealism is in a crucial regard misleading.) The first feature film made in postwar Germany beholds the physical destruction of German cities and repeatedly equates it with psychic devastation, suggesting how heavily the past weighed on some, though not all, citizens. Two sorts of ruin become intertwined, the rubble on the streets and the ruin in a returned soldier's mind, material damage and men- tal wreckage, both of which have been caused by outside forces. 61.

Myths, as Roland Barthes tells us, may well naturalize.66 Sebald's natural history of destruction is a problematic notion precisely because it revives a long-standing German form of mythical thinking that defers to fate and destiny rather than the power of human agency. It remains, in Andreas Huyssen's acute formulation, "closely tied to metaphys- ics and to the apocalyptic philosophy of history so prominent in the German tradition and recoded in a variety of ways in the postwar period."67 My endeavor has been to historicize the myths at work in Trümmerfilme, especially in their status as cultural productions and compensatory scenarios whose rhetoric con- tinues to exercise a pronounced influence on present discussions. 66.
