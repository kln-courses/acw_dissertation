<plain_text><page sequence="1">[1] 481 NOTE E DISCUSSIONI SHAH TEPE: A NEW APPROACH TO AN OLD EXCAVATION The study of urbanisation arising in the Iranian Area, made remarkable progress in the 70es and 80es thanks to several investigations carried out on sites, often already explored, in that region. In particular concerning the north-Iranian area the renewal of excavations at Tepe Hissar (Dyson-Howard 1989; Biscione-Tosi 1979) and the new absolute chronology worked out at that site, as well as the identification in Tureng tepe site of a cultural horizon typical of the Gorgan valley during the bronze age, strongly contributed to the a.m. results (Deshayes 1963, 1967, 1974, 1977)1. In addition the application of statistical methods, specially designed for the mortuary analysis, provides new approaches (Shennan 1975; Tainter 1977; Biscione-Bondioli 1988)2. It comes out from the general picture that starting from the second half of the IV millennium (late Uruk-Jemdet Nasr), there is a good cultural interaction among Turkmenia, Afghanistan and north Baluchistan (Dales 1977) and that since end IV-beginning III millennium several centres of that area reached an urban size and the region is organised on models very closed to the central place theory (Biscione-Tosi 1979; Johnson 1973 and 1975)3. 1 Papers strictly connected with the Shah tepe situation are quoted here, but the landscape of the central asian protohistory is changing very quickly. For the problems related to the iranian area, the following should be considered: R. DYSON «The relative and absolute chronology of Hissar II and the proto-elamite horizon of northern Iran» in O. Aurenche J. Evin F. Hours (edd.) Chronologies du Proche Orient.

In the III millennium the Iranian centres got free from the early elamite control and interacted by themself in the trade network between central Asia and Mesopotamia. This stage testifies a remarkable cultural homogeneity in the subject area (Bulgarelli 1981; Beale 1973; Amiet 1986). By following a theoretical model introduced by Johnson (1972, 1973, 1975) and tested on the situation of Mesopotamia and Susiana, the present work will try to verify how the minor centres of north Iran react to the economic and social inputs offered by the larger centres. The purpose is to understand whether villages and small communities were involved in a relationship network too, and what were the feedbacks on their own internal organisation. Shah tepe (Gorgan) site looks suitable for this investigation both for the small area of the tell (165 m x 135 m) and for its geographical position close to the south-western Caspian coast (Iran). The site was explored in the 3 Oes by the Swedish archaeologist T.J. Arne (1945). The finds, of which the major part was coming from the graves discovered with the eight shafts, were organised by a relative chronology (period III, Ill-lib, lib, IIa2, Hal, Islamic period) based on the pottery stiles of the furnitures as well as on the absolute depth of the finds, in the hypothesis that depositions were located approximately 1 meter under the contemporary dwelling level. Arne recognised three main classes of pottery made by hand or on slow wheel4: a) Black on red painted ware , decorated by simple geometrical patterns. This is the oldest and less frequent style; b) Grey polished ware with polished, incised and/or plastic decorations . It recalls the painted ware subjects and is the most attested type. c) Red coarse ware, that includes only few whole pieces, probably realised for food cooking. The only tipological differences between settlement and cemetery materials, are the slightly larger dimensions and the presence of real functional handles in the first group. S. Salvatori M. Tosi R.

Utilitarian lithic production doesn't include very significant samples (grinding millstones, door sockets, pestles, polishing and wet stones and chisels), but some beads of hard or semiprecious stone, like alabaster, light red or white and grey limestone, shale, carnelian, lapis, chalcedony and marble products (little columns, pots and cups), are included in the furnitures. Pins, neck laces beads and borers were made with caprovin bones. There are only few and small finds of metal, almost always of bronze7. Major part of those goods are used in decoration or body care: rings, spiral armlets, earrings, pins for make-up, a half-moon shaped razor. Some utilitarian goods are represented by a nice specimen of mattock, some rivets and tacks, awls, knives, chisels and metal sheets, fragments of metal boxes. In the protohistorical levels, Arne recognised basically three types of archaeological structures: a) house rooms; h ) platforms of burnt clay; c) graves. a) The dwelling structures are represented by four rooms, apparently independent each other, partially discovered at different levels in A and C shafts, in the southern area of the tell. Their stratigraphical position is not very clear in the excavation report. The plan of those structures is approximately squared. They are made by sun dried bricks or pressed clay (Arne 1945: 122) reinforced with wood pils included in the walls8. Traces of small sub-circular placing of smooth stones in the oldest room ('northern house' shaft A), may represent a remain of the floor cover (Arne 1945: fig. 209). h ) The platforms of burnt clay were found only in the eastern shafts (B-D-E-F-G-H). They are surfaces of various sizes and approximately round 5 It is possible that some zoomorphic figurines were made also of metal (see CIII 117), but from the publication of the left pieces we can not draw any final conclusion (Arne 1945: 306). 6 We can mention in this group also the necklaces beads made with faiance, sometime indicated also (unlikely) as glass (Arne 1945: 292). 7 A part from a small copper ring covered by a gold leaf, a couple of silver earrings, a bronze pin. 8 All the informations concerning the structures are based only on the excavation report, that is not always able to answer to the questions coming from the nowadays research. See Arne 1945: 36-7 and 46-7. 9 Some loose bricks, discovered at level -0.60m in the D shaft, are awarded by Arne to the de- fensive wall of the protohistorical settlement. Such an interpretation looks quite weak both for the identification of the structure, absolutely uncertain, and because no real settlements were discovered below the absolute depth of approximately -I- 1.6m.</page><page sequence="4">484 Fabrizia Orsaria [4] shape, consisting in a layer of red polished clay with or without coal traces (Fill 19-20, GUI without number, Bill 14, 20, Bila 17). Arne considers them as dwelling evidences (Arne 1945: 60, 62, 70, 78, 122), even if remains of fireplaces of various sizes close to them, bring to consider them as due to handicraft activities linked to fire applications (pottery burning or metal smelting10). c) The graves, almost all are single inhumation in simple pit, are totally 175, 43 of which contain child remains. There are no special graveyard areas in the hill: graves were found in all the shafts explored. Burieds are usually deposed on side, almost always in a contracted position, less frequently prone or dorsal. Orientation and side of deposition don't show significant preferences neither related with the chronological sequence, gender or age groups, at least for what it was possible to verify up today11. Furniture is present in the major part of graves (77% adults, 88% children); usually it includes small lithic or metallic goods and sometimes animal bones12. The relative chronology elaborated by Arne is essentially based on the pottery tipological taxonomy (very similar to the well known Hissar's one) together with the absolute depth of finds. He never refers to stratigraphie units in the modern meaning of the word. Based on the data available, some different grave phases were distinguished. These were linked to the occupational levels (dwelling, productivity or sporadic occupation13) on the basis of the pottery tipology (III, lib, IIa2, Hal), in order to recognise phases for settlement and nechropolis14 shorter than the periods established by Arne. 10 Platforms of burnt clay, very similar to these of Shah tepe, were discovered in the central-asia- tic site of Shortughai, and were explained as remains of small fireplaces for metal smelting (H.P. FRANCFORT M.H. Pottier, «Sondage préliminaire sur Pestablissement protohistorique harapeen de Shortugai (Afghanistan du Nord-Est)» Ars Asiatique , XXXV, 29-79, 1978; H.P. Francfort, «Tradi- tion harapéenne et innovation bactrienne à Shortugai», in L'archeologie de la Bactriane ancienne, Du- shanbe 1982, Paris 1985). 11 Due to the bad state of the skeletons, sometime very fragmentary, it is impossible to carry out an exhaustive osteological analysis. In fact from all the burieds of the protohistorical levels only 6 subjects of females and 1 1 of males have been identified. We referred only to two classes of age: chil- dren and adults, rarely youngs (C. Fuerst, The skeletal material collected during the excavations of Dr T.J. Arne in Shah tepe at Astrabat, Gorgan in Iran , 1940). 12 In some cases they don't fit the a.m. standard: 1) a new born baby deposed in a vase (Fill without number; Arne 1945: 62); 2) three double depositions: an adult and a baby (CU s2, BUI s2), a couple of adults (GII s 14- 15); 3) one sure collective deposition (Fill s3-7) and one hypothetical (Fill sl3-16); 4) some depositions located over a level of lime concretion (GII s6-7, si 1; Gill s3, perhaps s4). 13 Also the fréquentation levels were recognised on the basis of the absolute depth of the finds and, sometime, only thanks to presence of spread objects, discovered all at the same depth but without a clear logic-functional connection. 14 We have supposed also that the graves were located minimum 1.50-2.00 m below the fréquen- tation level, this also for practical and hygienic reasons. The tell surface (approximately 165 m x 135 m) does not allow to maintain a big distance between eventual houses and graves.</page><page sequence="5">[5] Shah tepe: a new approach to an old excavation 485 In spite of the methodological limits of the present procedure, this is at the moment the only operational device in order to reexamine the chronological sequence of this excavation15. Alpha and late- alpha phases Finds of levels -0.60/-0.15 m and 0.00/1.50 m are related to these phases (period III of Arne). They include pottery, whole or fragmentary, byproducts of stone working or pottery burning, cereal grinding millstones, pieces of clay figurines and other small baked clay samples discovered in the deepest levels of shaft A. In all the other shafts there are traces of fireplaces of different size together with (shafts B-F-G) platforms of burnt clay with coal residuals. They seems to indicate a sporadic fréquentation of the tell and presence of handicraft activities related to fire applications. None of the discovered graves can be related to this level. The first of these two phases can be distinguished through a limited number of finds in the shafts: A-B-C-G16, while during the following phase late-alpha, shafts A and C look temporarily neglected and the others seem very active. In these shafts there are several fireplaces and burnt clay platforms. In addition a smelting mould and a small smelting slag (shaft B) as well as a byproduct of pottery burning were discovered among the 'loose' materials (shaft F)17. Beta and late Beta phase The traces of handicraft activities or dwelling fréquentation discovered between approximately 1.60 and 2.80 m are referred to this phase (period III of Arne, Ill-lib = late-beta18). In A shaft at this level a sub-rectangular house room, here indicated as 'northern house'19, was discovered together with some depositions. The graves are 15 It follows that the use of some terms like 'layer', 'level' and 'chronological phase' is affected by some limitations of which the undersigned is fully aware. In order to avoid mistakes with the labels of the excavation reports, we used the greek alphabet letters to indicate the chronological phases. 16 Obviously shaft H is not included. Its exploration was limited to the superficial layers. 17 This confirms the hypothesis that the burnt clay platforms are remains of handicraft activities (ware burning or metal smelting). 18 In A and C shafts it seems that period lib of Arne (or at least the period or transition III-IIb) is anticipated. In fact furniture typical of the lib, occur in graves that are at absolute levels deeper than in the other shafts and, for this reason, are included in the period here defined as beta phase. This cir- cumstance, at that time already noted by Arne (Arne 1945: fig. 15), has a negligible chronological rele- vance, without reliable stratigraphie indications. 19 Even if neither this one or other denominations for the discovered houses were used by Arne, in this paper we applied them for practical and clearness reasons.</page><page sequence="6">486 Fabrizia Orsaria [6] contemporary to the two stages of house occupation and to a third one corresponding to the dwelling's abandon, at the end of this period. In all the other shafts the surfaces corresponding to this level are intended only for funerary purposes. The only exception is shaft F where a fireplace and a platform of burnt clay are present together with the graves. It means that here there is a slight continuity of the above mentioned productive activities. Gamma Phase This phase must be related to the dwelling evidences between level 2.80 and 4.00 m and to the graves between 1.30 and 2.75 m (period Ill-lib of Arne). A structure very similar to the 'northern house' was discovered in A shaft. It was named 'western house'. Some burials are located not very far from it or in the area of the already dismissed 'northern house'. Two similar structures, but slightly subsequent (late gamma) in the C shaft are represented by the 'polygonal house' in the west and by the 'eastern house' in the east. The walls of the first building seal some graves with furniture dated to period lib20. Apparendy it is not possible to attribute any depositions to the phase stricdy contemporary to the building of the two houses of shaft C. On the opposite, starting from this moment, all the other shafts, where graves look concentrated in separate burning areas, seem designed only for funerary purposes21. Delta phase Graves included in the layer between 3.10 and 4.60 m must be related to this phase. They correspond to a dwelling period to be located between 4.40 and 5.00 m (beginning period lib). Starting from this phase the finds are mainly composed by depositions and relevant furnitures with the only exception of moulding sand and a smelting mould discovered in the C shaft. They indicate a metallurgical activity subsequent to the dismission of the two houses. Epsilon phase In this phase the latest protohistorical burials discovered at levels between 5.10 and 6.30 m (initial phase = period lib; final phase = period Ha and Hal) are grouped. All the investigated surface was employed for gravel deposition. The Shah 20 Arne (Id. 1945: fig. 15) had already stated that in shaft A and C the traces of furniture of pe- riod lib are at a deeper level when compared with the other shafts. 21 In F shaft both the collective deposition and the embryo in the vase must be referred to this moment.</page><page sequence="7">[7] Shah tepe: a new approach to an old excavation 487 tepe's chronological sequence can therefore be linked to the Tureng tepe's one (Desha YES 1974 and 1977) and to the Tepe Hissar 's one (Dyson - Howard 1989; Forest 198522): Shah tepe III Tepe Hissar IC (Tureng tepe I-IIA); Shah tepe IlI-IIb Tepe Hissar IIA-IIB (Tureng tepe IIB); Shah tepe IIb Tepe Hissar IIIA-IIIB; Shah tepe II a2-l Tepe Hissar UIC (Tureng tepe IIICl). Concerning the Turkmenian and Susian area the actual presence of a trade and cultural network with Damghan-Gorgan23 region, as well as the availability of an updated absolute chronology confirm the chronological correlation between these cultural horizons during the IV-II millennium B.C. Shah tepe settlement can therefore be placed between Namazga II and Namazga V phases in the south-turkmenian sequence (Kohl 198424), and the disappearance of the Gorgan culture can be related to a period of settlement reorganisation that occurred in the transition between bronze and early iron age (Namazga IV; Biscione 1977)25. The period IA of Tepe Hissar (III of Shah tepe, alpha phase) can also be identified with Tepe Yaya VB with the Susian chalcolithic 4 and Sialk III 1-2, while the period III A of Hissar (Shah tepe IIb, beginning of epsilon phase) can be related to the Tepe Yaya IVC and to the protoelamite II, as well as to levels 10-8 of Shahr-i Sokhta (VOIGT 1987; Dyson 1987; DYSON-HOWARD 1989). 22 For a general picture of the chronological sequence in this area and of the related problems, see also: P.L.

For a theorical-conceptual approach to the problem of chronology in central Asia during these phases the following can help: KK. LAMBERG Karlowsky, «The 'longue duree' of the ancient Near East», inj. Desha YES (ed.) De l'lndus aux Balkans , 56-72, Paris 1985. 24 The chronology proposed by Kohl delays of approximately five centuries the dating proposed by the soviet researchers for the Namazga phases (I.N. Hlopin, «Les tombes de Sumbar - une clef pur l'harmonization des chronologies des sites de l'epoque du bronze du sud de l'Asie» in J. De- SHAYES (ed.) Le plateau iranienne..., Paris 1977, 143-154; L.

SARIANIDI, Central Asia, London 1972). 25 Concerning the problem of the settling organisation occurred at the beginning of the iron age, see also: P. Kohl R. BISCIONE M.L. INGRAHAM «Implications of recent evidence for the prehistory of northeastern Iran and southwestern Turkmenistan», Iranica Antiqua, 17, 1-20, 1982.</page><page sequence="8">488 Fabrizia Orsaria [8] The Shah tepe chronology is also in accordance with datings drawn up for the correspondent phases of Tepe Hissar and Tureng tepe. In accordance with Dyson (1992) and Deshayes (1967), the following sequence is proposed: period III phases = end V - first half IV millennium period Ill-lib = second half IV millennium period lib = first half III millennium period Ha = second half Ill-beginning II millennium In general the C14 datings, on which the above chronology is based remarkably anticipate the traditional chronology for the beginning of settled live in the site, while datings for the final level are basically unchanged when compared with Arne's conclusions26. Conclusions By a re-examination of data collected by Arne at Shah tepe, we can recognise the presence of two different areas: one residential (shaft A and B) and one quite far from it (probably) assigned to handicraft installations (shafts B-D-E-F-G-H). Such a bipolarity could be due to hygienic and safety reasons. It is also very likely that the whole settlement gradually moved along the hill area (as the platforms of burnt clay seem to confirm) producing a 'spiral stratigraphy', nowadays well known in other sites27 and usually induced by adapting to slow variation of ecoambiental exploitation28. 26 The similarity between finds of the final phases of the Gorgan culture and those of the archaic Dahistan culture (iron age, Namazga IV) has pointed out again the problem of the absolute chrono- logy and cultural continuity between Namazga V and VI. On the subject see also: I.N. Hlopin «Les tombes de Sumbar - une clef pur l'harmonization des chronologies des sites de l'epoque du bronze de sud de l'Asie centrale et de l'Iran» inj. DESHAYES (ed.) Le plateau iranienne..., 143-154, Paris 1977; L. Hlopina «Southern Turkmenia in the late bronze age», EW, 22, 199-214, 1972; V.M. MASSON V.l. Sarianidi, Central Asia, London 1972). 27 This interpretation key was proposed for Shahr-i-Sokhta, where the settling shifting was rela- ted to ecological-environmental reasons (R. BISCIONE G.M. BULGARELLI L.COSTANTINI S. PlPERNO M. Tosi «Archaeological discoveries and methodological problems in the excavations of Shahr-i Sokhta, Sistan» South Asian Archaeology , 1973, 12-52 1974). The cultural activity in the iranian area during the early Namazga V-VI phases was confirmed also by: R. BISCIONE, «The crisis of central Asia urbaniza- tion in II millennium B.C. and villages as an alternative system» in J. DESHAYES (ed.) Le plateau ira- nienne et l'Asie centrale..., 113-128, Paris 1977 and P. Kohl R. Biscione M.L. INGRAHAM, «Implica- tions of recent evidence for the prehistory of northeastern Iran and southwestern Turkmenistan», Ira- nica Antiqua, 17, 1-20, 1982. For a more general treatment of this argument see: J.M. O'Shea «Coping with scarcity: exchange and social storage» in A. SHERIDAN and G. Bailey (edd.) Economic archaeo- logy, B.A.R. Supp. Ser. 59, 167-183, Oxford 1981. 28 The discovery at Shah tepe of bird bones, turtle bones and shells, sea shells and hooks leads to think to a complex exploitation of the natural reserves of the surrounding area.</page><page sequence="9">[9] Shah tepe : a new approach to an old excavation 489 A horizontal interpretation was tried also for the grave stratigraphy: starting from period Ill-lib (gamma phase), graves of shafts B-D-E-F-G-H look concentrated in separated depositional areas, that are generally utilised for a limited period of time and then dismissed in favour of other areas not far from the above. This creates a clear horizontal balance of depositional areas. Furniture of period III (early alpha-beta phases) is in general composed only by one to three ceramic pots; their number increases in the period Ill-lib (late beta-gamma phases29). Later on, the number of pottery becomes fixed around one-three items for each grave, while metal and hard stone goods start their appearing in the furniture. These objects will become more and more frequent until period Ha (epsilon phase). The major part of the very rich depositions (both adults and children) are located in the eastern areas of the excavation, i.e. those formerly deputed to productive activities, in accordance to our hypothesis. The graves excavated in former residential areas (A and C shafts) are frequently without furniture and children are buried close to (or on the top of) the dismissed houses. It is very likely that during period III (alpha-beta phases), the community was structured in a horizontal way by age classes, and that later (delta-epsilon phases) status became hereditary for some subjects, mainly represented by inhumated of sector G. The fact that graves are grouped in separate areas may indicate the existence of different kinds of social organisation such as: clans, families production groups, etc. It seems that the individuals buried with poor or no furniture in A and C belong to a social group with less possibilities of wealth achievement when compared with those buried in the eastern shafts. Based on the data available it is quite difficult to establish whether the territorial segregation could indicate a social segregation too30. The burnt clay platforms and the increasing amount of grey polished ware in the furnishing goods starting from III and Ill-lib periods (beta phase) seems to indicate a production raising31 indirectly testified by a greater variety and richness of the mortuary furniture in the following phases too. 29 The major number of vases was recorded in the furniture of grave EHI s6, and was composed by nine ceramic elements. 30 For a similar situation at Tepe Hissar, look also: V.M. MASSON V.l. Sarianidi, Central Asia London 1972, and R. Biscione M. Tosi, Protostoria degli stati turanici , Annali XXXIX, suppl. 20, voi 19, fase. 3, Napoli 1979. M Anyway the situation doesn t fill completely parameters requested by ť. KICE («évolution or specialised pottery production. A trial model». Current Anthropology, 22, 3, 219-239, 1981), for the existence of a specialised organisation for pottery production, which are basically the following: use of a turntable and presence of permanent structures for production and burning, policentric circulation and distribution of the product complex social structure.</page><page sequence="10">490 Fabrizia Orsaria [10] In the cultural sequence of Shah tepe the above represents the first signal of production improvement (beta and early gamma phases = Tepe Hissar IIB and IIIA-B = second half IV millennium B.C.). This happens during the period of protoelamite trade control, when the first handicraft laboratories are installed at Tepe Hissar too. The autonomy from the Susan trading monopoly, achieved by Iranian cities (Tepe Hissar IIB and IIIA-B, Namazga IV and V), corresponds to a second welfare period of Shah tepe, as proved by the relatively rich furnishing goods of epsilon phase (IIb Ha), where the presence of precious materials (metals, alabaster, hard stones) seems to indicate that the community has a limited access to wealth passing through Hissar and Tureng tepe, that probably play the role of 'first level centres' for the Damghan and Gorgan areas respectively (JOHNSON 1972, 1973, 1975, ADAMS 198232). In this trading network Shah tepe was a centre providing different products (shells, dried fish, leather, feather, tortoise shells) that were bartered with rare goods, coming from the bigger centres. In this case the trading relationship induces a raising of cultural processes, even if of modest relevance (Lamberg Karlowsky 1977). In fact the economical and social evolution of Shah tepe is clearly related to an outside input and doesn't become an autonomous process of social and productive organisation in the community. Finally, when the trade relation network between Iran and Mesopotamia breaks up, around the second quarter of II millennium B.C. and there is a settlement shrinkage of the most important urban agglomerations in the region (Biscione - Tosi 1979; Biscione 1977; Lamberg Karlowsky 1974 and 1977) also the modest Shah tepe site disappears together with the remaining centres of the Gorgan culture (see note 27 pag. 488).
