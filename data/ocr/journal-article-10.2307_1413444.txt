<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTES The Theories of EvoTution. By YVES DELAGE, M. D. and MARIE GOLDSMITH. Tr. by Andre Tridon. New York, Huebsch, 1912. 352 P. This is an excellent and concise statement of the present condition of the problems of evolution. First come the fore period and that represented by Darwin, although most of the chapters are post-Dar- winian. The topics since Darwin that are treated here are natural and sexual selection, theories of heredity, Spencer's units, Nigeli, DeVries, Weismann, germinal selection, Roux, Galton, Mendel, trans- mission of acquired characters, theories, observations and experiments, Lamarckians, organic selection, isolation, orthogenesis, mutation. Everything is clear and concise, though perhaps a little simple and elementary. It is somewhat to be regretted that the book contains so very few references to literature on the subject. The scope of formal logic. By A. T. SHEARMAN. London, Uni- versity of London Press, 1911. 165 p. This comprises five chapters as follows: explanation of terms, vari- ation of symbolic procedure, examinations of properties in generalized logic, general logic and the common logical doctrines, general logic as the basis of arithmetical and geometrical processes, philosophical treatment of number and of space. Die Abstammungslehre: eine gemeinverstdindliche Darstellung und kritische Ubersicht der verschiedenen Theorien mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung der Mutationstheorie. Von P. G. BUEKERS, Leipzig, Quelle &amp; Meyer, 1909. 354 P. This is a general survey of the subject of descent and is designed to be both popular and critical, setting forth special theories but with most reference to mutation. The main chapters are historical, propaga- tion, systematics, variability, purposiveness and adaptation, natural and artificial selection, unpurposiveness, auxiliary theories (under which are included sexual selection, correlation, variations, Ndigeli's perfection theory, animistic notions like Haeckel's and germinal selec- tion), criticism of adaptation theory, sexual increase and death before maturity, limited action of selection, mutation and selection, a glance into the development-history of living nature. Uber den Willensakt und das 'Temperament. Von NARZISS ACH. Leipzig, Quelle &amp; Meyer, 191o. 324 p. This is a very careful series of experimentations, by the man who now happily occupies the chair of Kant in K6nigsberg, upon the will. He caused a series of impressions to become habitual if not merely memorized and then his subjects by an act of will had to break in upon the series in various ways and introspect. We have then here a closer ranged view of the processes of will than hitherto, which sheds very much new light. Though the work as a whole is perhaps not so interesting as the author's original study of will, it is nevertheless</page><page sequence="2">480 BOOK NOTES of great interest and significance. It would not be surprising if the most valuable part of it all proved to be what he has to say at the end conterning feelings as involved in the acts upon which his experiments were directed. Empfindung und Denken. Von AUGUST MESSER. Leipzig, Quelle &amp; Meyer, 19o8. 199 p. This is a very interesting study. It begins by discussing the sensory elements in outer perception and then tries to delineate the thought elements in it, then passes to inner perception, attention and abstrac- tion, sentence and judgment, lapse of thought and knowledge, psycho- logical and logical discussions of thought and finally, the pedagogical implications of all this. Die Grenzwissenschaften der Psychologie. Von W. HELLPACH. Leip- zig. Dfirr, 1902. 515 p. The author first treats the anomaly of the nervous system, then animal phsiology, neuropathology, psycho-physiology and develop- mental psychology. It was well indeed, now that psychology is nar- rowing down and particularly laboratory psychology is drawing in its phylacteries, to have psychologists at least instructed upon the bound- aries of their kingdom on all sides. This is what this writer attempts to do and very properly dedicates his work to Wundt. Handbook of mental examination methods. By SHEPHERD IVORY FRANZ. New York, The Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases Pub- lishing Co., 1912. 165 p. (Nervous and Mental Disease Mono- graph Series, No. io.) This work discusses sensation, movement, speech and aphasia, atten- tion, apprehension and perception, memory, association, time of mental processes, general intelligence and examination, methods of dealing with observational data. Das Problem der objectiven M6glichkeit: eine Bedeutungsanalyse. Von AUGUST GALLINGER. Leipzig, J. A. Barth, I912. 126 p. (Schriften der Gesellschaft ffir psychologische Forschung. Heft 16, IV Sammlung.) The author discusses here connections of being positive and negative, the idea of ground, especially of knowledge. After discussing the idea of objective possibility, he distinguishes and discusses separately its empirical, regulative, concrete, abstract and hypothetical possibility, contrasting possibility and impossibility. The economy and training of memory. By HENRY J. WATT. Second Impression. London, Edwin Arnold, 1909. 128 p. The best chapter in this little book is the author's account of the experimental investigation of memory, the factors which influence it and mental imagery. The book shows a pretty good knowledge of the many experiments in memory during the last twenty-five years. Logik der reinen Erkenntnis. Von HERMANN COHEN. Berlin, Bruno Cassirer, I902. 520 p. After an introduction, the chief topics here are the judgments of the thought processes, especially the judging of original identity and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK NOTES 481 contradiction. Then come the judgments of mathematics, such as reality, plurality, universality, then of the mathematical sciences, sub- stance, law, idea and finally, judgments of method, e.g. possibility, reality, interest and limitation. Beauty, ugliness and other studies in psychological aesthetics. By VERNON LEE and C. ANSTRUTHER-THOMSON. New York, John Lane Company, 1912. 376 p. The writer begins with anthropomorphic aesthetics, then discusses its empathy, its organic accompaniments, then passes to its central problem as represented by Miinsterberg, Titchener and the Wfirz- burgers. Beauty and ugliness are next considered and then aesthetic responsiveness in its variations and accompaniments based on the author's own experiences. Psychophysik. Von W. WIRTH. Leipzig, S. Hirzel, 1912. 522 P. This memoir which very fittingly comes from Leipzig is the most comprehensive and as it ought to be, by far the most valuable treat- ment of its subject for many years. The author treats of the methodic questions including self-observation and experiment, quanti- tative and qualitative analysis, then takes up auxiliary aids from the domain of collective Masslehre, then the methods of reproduction which is really the best part of the book and finally, treats of the reaction method. Chapters from modern psychology. By JAMES ROWLAND ANGELL. New York, Longmans Green &amp; Co., 1912. 308 p. This volume contains lectures at Union College early in 1911. The matter is arranged for a general college audience and the author treats in his eight lectures of general, physiological, experimental, abnormal, individual and applied, social and racial, animal and finally general genetic psychology, with a retrospect. Aristoteles iieber die Seele. Neu iibersetzt von ADOLPH BussE Leip- zig, Felix Meiner, 1911. 12o p. (Philosophische Bibliothek, Band 4.) Ascetiques et mystiques. Par ABBE JEAN DELACROIX. Paris, Bloud &amp; Cie, 1912. 61 p. (Questions theologiques.) Fatigue. By F. L. WELLS. Reprinted from the Psychological Bulletin, November, 1911. Vol. 8, No. II, pp. 390-395. Ueber den Traum: experimental-psychologische Untersuchungen. Von J. MOURLY VOLD. hrsg von 0. Klemm. Zweiter Band. Leipzig, J. A. Barth, 1912. pp. 449-879. The second volume begins with the fourth section and is devoted to non-experimental and normal dreams where the author continued his method of investigating the upper extremities, especially stimulating the right and left hands. He also makes some interesting conclusions in the last section concerning the relation of dreams to various condi- tions and what the elements are which enter into their composition, discussing incidentally dreams of floating and hovering, dreams of dreams and speech in dreams.</page><page sequence="4">482 BOOK NOTES Die Seele des Kindes. Von W. AMENT. Stuttgart, Franck, 1911. 93 p. (Dritte, verbesserte Auflage.) This is a rather copiously illustrated story of child life which embodies various previous works of the author and covers the entire period from birth to well rounded adolescence. Uber die psychologischen Theorien Freuds und verwandte An, schauungen, Systematik und kritische Erdrterung. Von ARTHUR KRONFELD, Leipzig, Wilhelm Engelmann, 1912. 12o p. (Samm- lung von Abhdlgn zur psy. Pfidagogik aus dem Archiv fiir die gesamte Psychologie, hrsg. von E. Meumann. III. Band-I. Heft.) This is by far the most searching study that has ever been made of the Freudian precepts. The first part is taken up with an exposition which is a model of condensation and lucidity. The second part is devoted to criticisms. The latter are directed mainly against some of Freud's mechanisms but the chief fault found is with the clearness and consistency of his basal philosophical principles. Most of these points seem to the writer of this review well taken, but it should not be forgotten that Freud is not a philosopher; but that he has made all his most epoch-making new departures on the basis of a very pro- longed and wide-ranged clinical experience and that he has had the insight and sagacity to penetrate into the meaning of these cases in a way that has shed new light upon the structure and functions of the human soul. Criminal responsibility and social constraint. By RAY MADDING MC- CONNELL. New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1912. 339 p. The first part is devoted to the aims of punishment, viz., expiation, retribution, deterrents, reform and social utility; part second to free- dom in crime, psychology of will, motive and choice, mental causation, freedom which is identified with ignorance of causes, determinism assumed in daily life and in science, the testimony of self-conscious- ness, freedom or absence of external constraint, character and en- vironment, transcendental freedom. The third part is devoted to re- sponsibility for crime and treats of early extremes and present prac- tices, arguments for complete irresponsibility, contrast of moral considerations and social expediency, the basis of personal accounta- bility and of social constraints and practical procedures. Nervous and mental diseases. By ARCHIBALD CHURCH, M. D., and FREDERICK PETERSON, M. D. Philadelphia, W. B. Saunders Co., 1911. 932 p. (Seventh thoroughly revised edition.) It is very creditable to the medical profession that this valuable work has reached already a seventh edition and to the authors that it has been thoroughly revised by over 150 interpolations of varying lengths. Five important chapters have been largely rewritten and the various recent theories of the nature of hysteria have been outlined. The biology of physa. By JEAN DAWSON. Behavior Monographs, vol. I, No. 4, 1911. Serial No. 4, 120 p. This is a very interesting and valuable paper and the result of a great deal of very painstaking work. The author first discusses the relation of the freshwater snail to its natural environment, then the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK NOTES 483 mucus and the mucous threads of physa, then its food and food activities, then its respiration and finally, describes some psychic phenomena. The evolution of vertebrates and their kin. By WILLIAM PATTEN. Ill. Philadelphia, P. Blakiston's Sons &amp; Co., 1912. 486 p. This author has spent many years in teaching and studying biology and all this time has been possessed with the idea of uniting the branches of the animal kingdom into a natural coherent system or genealogical tree that would indicate the rise and decline of the important functions and organs and map out the highway of organic evolution and even assign in biological terms the approximate days and surroundings for the critical events, etc. The main point here is to discover which one, if any, of the many existing invertebrate phlya form the trunkline of descent from the lowest vertebrates to the coelenterates and through them to the protozoa. The author holds the McNard theory of the origin of vertebrates and gives this con- siderable space in the first chapters of his book which-although it is hardly in the line of this journal to discuss in detail-appears to be one of very great interest and significance which every genetic psy- chologist will greatly profit by knowing. Prehistoric man. By W. L. H. DUCKWORTH. New York, G. P. Put- nam's Sons, 1912. 156 p. (The Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature.) The ground covered by this little book is the precursors of paleolithic man, alluvial deposits in the cave, associated animals and implements, human fossils and the geological chronology, human evolution in the light of recent research. This seems to be a very sensible and con- densed little finder and it has an excellent collection of literature. A new logic. By CHARLES ARTHUR MERCIER. London, Heinemann, 1912. 422 P. The author premises that his professional brethen will look askance upon a physician who wastes his time on logic and that logicians will regard him "with the contemptuous abhorrence that is bestowed all the world over by professionals upon the amateur." He certainly does go his own way regardless of the logic of schools, treating first the proposition, its nature, meaning, kinds, constitutions, ratio, terms, their origin and kinds, a new doctrine of quantity with particular distribu- tive rules, the individual, the single, intensive, comprehensive quality, including classification, negative terms and modes of denial. The second book is devoted to empirical reasoning, the indirect appeal to experience, imperfect induction. The third book is on the methods of explication involving the laws of thought, the canons of inference, the implications of simple and compound propositions, faults of the rules of a syllogism, conditional proposition and its implication. The fourth book is on analogy, composite reasoning, fallacies and the faults of the existing systems, while the appendix contains a sug- gestive note upon the classification of sciences. Syphilomanie et syphilophobie. Par ALEXANDRE MOVRAN. Paris, Henri Jouve, 19o09. 70 p. Syphilis has a moral affect upon sound people and many more who are affected by it. Each deserves to be a special mental syndrome or</page><page sequence="6">484 BOOK NOTES rather two of them. The first this writer calls syphilomaniacs who have a certain indemnity for the disease when it comes and often take refuge in hospitals and retreats. Their mental state is more or less carefully attended and may or may not be cured. On the other hand, syphilophobiacs are syphilitics and their phobia may be transient or permanent. The individual reaction is measured by the intensity of the emotivity. One variety of these phobiacs are altruists, but these are not discussed here. This phobia can impel to suicide or crime. Both manias and phobias are sometimes an extension in the nervous field of neuropathic heredities of various kinds, although sex and pro- fession have less influence. The reputation of vareole on which quacks pronounce is the chief generator of this phobia. Treatment should be general and social prophylaxis with instruction for the masses, distinguishing between what is to be feared and what is not. Individual treatment ought to be attempted, but the nervous therapeu- tics is rather limited. Travels, substitution of a mania, pardon, con- solation, encouragement are indicated. La formation directe du raisonnement chez l'enfant. Par M. GuECHOT. Paris, Hachette et Cie, 1909. 45 P. This little book discusses the following subjects: how the infant comes to know its senses, attention, reflection, direct observation and the r61le of consciousness, the sources of sensation, objects and the actions essential in an object, the essence of action, how and why, the elements of teaching French and intellectual formation, the r61e of grammar, the importance of reading in relation to the development of attention and the formation of reason, direct observation and internal observation, moral education. Edgar Poe. Par eMILE LAUVRIERE. Paris, Bloud et Cie, 1912. 252 p. (Les Grands Acrivains strangers.) This monographical study gives the life of Poe and connects it at each point with his works. The author has evidently made a very careful study and discusses his theory and gives an interesting account of the genesis of the terror he expresses in the Raven, with interesting side remarks on fear. His heredity he finds to be very wretched, his youth irregular, his works only partly sane and his death premature and miserable. Die nerv6sen Augstgefiihle. Von THOMAS MAINHARDT. Leipzig, Wendel, 19o8. 128 p. The writer first discusses the nature and origin of the various condi- tions of anxiety, the modes of avoiding fear, anxiety about witches, anxieties connected with the heart, diseases, with callings, here- dity, sex anxiety caused by things heard and shown, agoraphobia, certain neurasthenic feelings of anxiety, the natural methods of heal- ing, gymnastics and Turnen, and the hypnotic processes. Les localisations celebrales: esquisse meicale et psychologique. By JEAN FERRAND. Paris, Rousset, 1911. 87 p. This is a rather severe arraignment of present theories and methods of determining cerebral localization because it has a materialistic moral. The precipitant tendency to utilize anatomical, clinical and physiological facts for the determination of problems that are essenti- ally metaphysical is wrong. Condemnation of the theory of images and the doctrine of the associationist seems a real triumph of the old spiritualistic philosophy which will survive all attacks.</page></plain_text>
