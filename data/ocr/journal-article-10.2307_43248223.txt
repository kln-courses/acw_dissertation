<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WAY OF PARADOX: SPIRITUAL LIFE AS TAUGHT BY MEISTER ECKHART, by Cyprian Smith, O.S.B. Darton, Longman and Todd, London, 1987. 131 pages. Â£3.95. Popularization largely functions as a term of contempt in the academic circles whose excrescences require it. On a deeper level, popularizers make remote and difficult areas of thought and achievement accessible to those who are the ultimate and intended beneficiaries- the people. Socrates, the Buddha, and Jesus were popularizers in this sense. So was Meister Eckhart, one of the leading theologians of the fourteenth century and its greatest preacher. So also is Cyprian Smith, who has undertaken to render 'a clear and balanced account' of Eckhart's spiritual teaching. This is not an easy task, if a worthy one, considering the distance between Eckhart's century and our own, and also the inherent problems of trying to cope with a philosopher, theologian, and above all, a preacher of uncommon depth, brilliance, and creativity, much of whose doctrine survives only in outline form or as fragmentary notes preserved by his hearers. A monk of Ampleforth Abbey where he teaches, Smith modestly disclaims in the end that his 'exposition of Eckhart's teaching is neither exhaustive nor particularly deep' (p. 131). His book nevertheless provides a solid, readable, informative, and surprisingly comprehensive account of the Meister's spiritual doctrine. Smith does not attempt to translate into ordinary language Eckhart's more obscure and convoluted philosophical and theological speculations. Thus, his sources are almost exclusively the German sermons and treatises, for which he wisely relies for the most part on Maurice Walshe's superb three- volume translation from Element Books (1987). Two introductory chapters summarize Eckhart's life in the context of the turbulent fourteenth century and the place of his 'way' to God in the context of our own times. The section on the ways of knowing in chapter two is particularly interesting, especially in light of a later discussion on the similarities and differences between Eckhart's doctrine and that of The Cloud of Unknowing. Eckhart was an intellectualist. His way looked ahead to final vision- but in this life, the knowing is an unknowing, the vision of God a dark one. Chapters three through six present an overview of themes central or significant in the Meister's spirituality- God paradoxically transcendent and immanent, internal and external, image and emptiness; the dynamic 'boiling' and 'melting' of God; the origin of the Word by divine speech and birth; and the birth of the Word in history and human hearts. Most of Eckhart's major themes are presented in capsule form- the spark or ground of the soul; abgeschiedenheit ; God as Godhead; living 'without why'; the soul's identity with the Son. For those unfamiliar with the focal point of Eckhart's spirituality, the birth of the Word in the soul, Smith's discussion will help immeasurably, especially with regard to the achievement of emotional equilibrium, which follows as its emblem. In the final three chapters, Smith applies the main principles of Eckhart's teaching to the situation of contemporary Christians attempting to develop a solid but practical spirituality. His discussion of mysticism begins from a modern and, as he notes, erroneous 248</page><page sequence="2">conception of the term. In clearing up what mysticism is not, however, Smith, like many current writers, hesitates to commit himself to what mysticism is, thus leaving unresolved the issue of Eckhart's own mysticism. His treatment of evil and suffering is excellent. Occasionally, Smith's commentary moves well beyond Eckhart, as in his discussion of the eucharist, in which, he says, we are eaten by God rather than vice versa. But if not the letter, at least the spirit is Eckhart's, who would have doubtless delighted in the inversion. The last chapter, 'Echoes', summarizes Smith's book and Eckhart's doctrine in a few, admirably succinct pages. Smith is especially alert to the paradoxical and dialectical character of Eckhart's thinking, as well as its radiance. The image he suggests of a stained- glass window is apt, for with Eckhart's teaching, like a rose window, the whole achieves its effectiveness by the juxtaposition of fragments, each of which has its own hue and translucence. Seen together, a greater unity and coherence redefines each element. The short bibliography provides helpful references for readers eager to deepen their acquaintance with Eckhart's spiritual doctrine. Among the book's few weaknesses, Smith appears to disregard Eckhart's emphasis on justice, especially with regard to the birth of the Word. For Eckhart, this birth occurs in the heart of the just person as just, a point which links the Meister's teaching not only with its biblical and patristic antecedents but with contemporary Christian concerns. Similarly, the overuse of male pronouns for God is bound to be off-putting to the growing number of Christians sensitive to sexist language. Ironically, in a single paragraph on p. 53 which begins 'God is utterly transcendent,' the words 'he', 'him', 'his', and 'himself' occur twenty-one times. Apparently God has not quite transcended the anthropomorphic bias that, as Smith elsewhere observes, Eckhart himself rose above with his astonishing images of God in labour and giving birth. The Way of Paradox is a personal, even pastoral interpretation of Eckhart's spiritual doctrine rather than an attempt to synopsize that doctrine. It succeeds well in its intention. As an appreciation by a gifted writer, it is an excellent introduction and a safe guide to the teaching of a great spiritual master and should attract many serious readers to a fuller acquaintance with the Meister.
