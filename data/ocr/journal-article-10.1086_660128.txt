         <title>DOG GONE</title>
         <p>IN 1877 GEORGE JOHN ROMANES BOUGHT HIS DOG, Major, a train ticket to London so that he might “go the way of the cats.” The recipient was the young physiologist Edward Schäfer at University College, where Major was to be vivisected. Romanes was content: the vivisection of his dog would provide “the satisfaction of feeling that he has been of <italic>some</italic> use.”1</p>
         <p>These events took place against a background of increasing public animosity between those at the forefront of the scientific community and those who rejected vivisection, or animal experimentation <italic>per se</italic>, as a moral or useful avenue of inquiry in medical research. In 1870, very little vivisection was carried out in Britain, but with the appointment of Michael Foster as praelector of Trinity College, Cambridge, English physiology was to undergo a transformation. It was the defining moment of a movement among medical scientists, starting around midcentury, “to reform the medical curriculum around the new physiology,” the methods of which were being imported from the centers of learning in Germany and France.2 Although Foster's appointment was highly significant for the institutional structure of physiological research, perhaps of more dramatic import was the publication, in 1873, of the <italic>Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory</italic>, edited by John Burdon‐Sanderson and with contributions by Foster, among others. Criticized for its failure adequately to instruct researchers on the use of anesthetics, it fueled fears about the rise of painful experimentation among an increasingly calcified community of medical scientists. Burdon‐Sanderson had attended the lectures of Claude Bernard, the “Father of Physiology,” in Paris and had replaced Foster at University College when the latter received his Cambridge appointment. They were the leading figures associated with vivisection in Britain as the controversy broke. Both men played mentor to, and were lifelong friends of, George John Romanes.3</p>
         <p>The vivisection dispute of the early 1870s, which resulted in the formation of societies for the restriction and for the abolition of vivisection, resolved into the presentation of rival petitions for legislation with respect to animal experimentation, with Frances Power Cobbe leading the way for the antivivisectionists and Charles Darwin rallying the scientific community. Both groups introduced bills in 1875, the scientists (although not entirely in agreement) largely acknowledging the need for moderate regulation in order to quell what they perceived as antivivisectionist cant.4 The result of the rivalry was the formation of a Royal Commission, which reported on the subject in 1876. Thereafter, the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876 passed through Parliament, establishing the regulations by which vivisection practices were to be licensed.5 Contrary to the hopes of the scientific community, the antivivisectionist movement continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1870s and early 1880s, partly because the regulation of experimental research actually legitimized its subsequent growth under legally obtained licenses. Although literally describing the cutting of a living being, the term “vivisection” was generally understood to encompass a broad range of experiments on animals. Susan Lederer has observed that “the word <italic>vivisection</italic> was used to denote any experimental manipulation,” with the words “vivisection” and “experimentation” being used interchangeably.6 Although Lederer's focus was on the American debates, the same is true for Britain. Despite several objections raised during the Royal Commission's proceedings in 1875–1876, the commission on “the Practice of Subjecting Live Animals to Experiments for Scientific Purposes” became known almost universally as the “Commission on Vivisection.”7 The vivisection controversy therefore encompassed a range of practitioners pushing for the advancement of science—in physiology, germ theory, vaccination, bacteriology, and toxicology, for example—as well as their respective opponents; it thus acquired broad social, cultural, and political importance.</p>
         <p>Historiographically, the vivisection controversy from the 1870s to the 1890s has been richly examined. Debates have formed around antivivisection as a feminist and a popular movement; about antivivisection and the animal cruelty movement; about scientists' responses to antivivisectionists and the policy implications of the controversy; and about vivisection and the professionalization of science.8 Romanes was personally and professionally involved in this controversy at many levels. How might the vivisection of his own dog shed new light on scientists' support for animal experimentation? What can the experiences of an individual contribute to our understanding of the vivisection debates?</p>
         <p>The answer lies in the still embryonic understanding of the historical meaning of the term “gentleman.”9 The vivisection controversy has been cast as an essentially public media event, but there is good reason further to explore the extent to which the public scientific support of vivisection was motivated by private sentiments and prejudices, by personal relationships and affections. The richness of gentlemanly experience can be revealed through an investigation of the intertwining of public and private life, a binary opposition that collapses under scrutiny. Romanes's support for vivisection was motivated by a cocktail of concerns: for public reputation (a general apprehension surrounding gentlemanly status, particularly of his friends); for professional self‐interest (cutting up animals was not foreign to Romanes himself); and for private affections and arrangements (the centrality of vivisection in the private life of a gentleman scientist). To see the vivisection debate through these multiple perspectives is to see it as a story of morality in the public gaze, collegial duty, and intimate relations. It brings to the fore the tensions and slippages between prevailing codes of amateurism and the necessity of professional organization.10 This essay is structured accordingly. Its aim is gradually to reveal the professional and private interests that underlay public representations. A narrative of what was plain for anyone to see is followed by an analysis of what was being said “behind the scenes.”</p>
         <p>Such an approach might perhaps be applied in any context. But the vivisection debates are particularly enticing, for they hinged on a rhetorical negotiation of the very concept of the gentleman. This has so far been poorly understood by historians, who have focused on the more apparent ends of the antagonists: opposition to animal cruelty, on the one hand, and the advancement of science (or medicine), on the other. It has been pointed out elsewhere that these nominal motives concealed deeper anxieties about the state of civil society, morality, and religion, which can be categorized as competing anthropocentric visions: one embedded within a religious framework of propriety, the other embedded in a Darwinist concept of hierarchical kinship.11 At the center of the vivisection debates, ultimately, was <italic>man</italic>. More specifically, in any given case it was a man who did the vivisecting: the controversy was fueled by questions about his character, his nature, and his temperament. To examine a vivisecting gentleman's thoughts on what gentlemen should be, and the ways in which these ideas informed his defense of scientific practice, is to penetrate much further than narratives on vivisection have tended to go. It cuts to the heart of Victorian identity anxieties: What did it mean to be a gentleman in a period of rapid professionalization and specialization? How are we to negotiate the emergence of new social formations and new moralities? If gentlemanliness (in the figure of the gentleman scientist) was being put to the knife, it is certainly worth exploring how gentlemen responded to the operation.</p>
         <p>What is most striking about such an approach is that it seems to eliminate an avenue of inquiry that typically dominates investigations into the history of vivisection: the question of morality. To some extent, this is necessary, for it is significant that provivisectionists rarely answered antivivisectionists on the terms the latter supplied. This seeming unresponsiveness reveals a fundamental slippage between the moral grounds on which each camp pitched its argument. While the antivivisectionists drew their convictions from Christian morality and from Kant (wherein cruelty to animals was thought analogous to cruelty among humans and therefore a first step toward inuring the heart to God), vivisection's supporters relied on a notion of Darwinian kinship, which ensured that scientific and medical experimentation on animals would ultimately benefit humanity. Vivisectionists did not defend their practices in terms of cruelty because they did not acknowledge that they were cruel. Concomitantly, they saw what they perceived as antivivisectionist cant to be, at best, evidence of a misplaced or misguided humanity and, at worst, as leading in itself to acts of cruelty in depriving humans of medical advances. Where the question of morality does figure, however, is in the provivisectionists' allusions to good character. Romanes in particular offers some striking examples of this enduring belief in the qualities of a gentleman. Since gentlemen were manifestly moral, it stood to reason that gentlemanly occupations were also moral. This kind of logic was proposed as sufficient to ward off any tendency toward the callousness about which antivivisectionists raised fears.</p>
         <p>Romanes was an eminent Victorian scientist of independent means: a “gentleman” who went about his scientific investigations in the true spirit of the amateur. To his family and closest friends he went under the sobriquet “The Philosopher,” a name owed, according to his wife, to his “sweetness of temper and calmness of manner.”12 Romanes's philosophical bent was not confined to intellectual activity but, rather, encompassed a complete character profile that distinguished him as a gentleman. Indeed, he was known to look unfavorably on mere “paper philosophers,” whose public intellects could by no means compensate for their lack of social graces.13 Romanes embodied a midcentury tradition, identified by Jim Endersby, in which “the ideal of a disinterested pursuit of knowledge, preferably conducted by independently wealthy gentlemen, was a key factor in making the term ‘philosophical,’ rather than ‘professional,’ into the highest accolade one could bestow on a scientific man.”14</p>
         <p>Romanes's intellectual compass was broad, incorporating comparative psychology, physiology, zoology, Darwinian theory, theology, and the philosophy of mind.15 He also dabbled in sundry other public issues—the remit of a man of letters—such as the quality of recreation and the question of female education. In his spare time, he wrote and sometimes published poetry (usually anonymously).16 Romanes was an important voice in public matters concerning the advancement of science, and he became a major figure as his personal relationship with Darwin blossomed. Insofar as Darwin was, according to Janet Browne, a “a reputable scientific gentleman, courteous, trustworthy, and friendly, who did not speak lightly of the momentous questions coming under his gaze, a champion of common sense, honest to his data, and scornful of ‘mere conjecture,’” he was a prime model for Romanes. Browne's description of Darwin as “not bound by any intellectual constraints … [with] no teaching or lecturing commitments like Huxley, no professional occupation to fulfill like Hooker, no administrative tasks like Gray,” applies to Romanes as well; it could be added that he displayed youthful irreverence at times and industrial energy at others. The nineteenth‐century amateur was not necessarily, as Martin Rudwick reminds us, <italic>amateurish</italic>.17 Financial independence did not quell the intellectual spirit of competition but, rather, quickened it. The impositions of unscientific, or even antiscientific, outsiders sharpened the gentleman scientist's awareness of his own expertise and intensified public antagonisms. After Darwin's death, Romanes was perhaps the leading advocate of natural selection, and he defended Darwin's theory with verve while also attempting to augment it with his own ideas.18 These varied interests formed what we might call the “macroscope” of the Victorian gentleman scientist. A look through its lens enables us to understand the “service” of Romanes's dog, while also allowing for an assessment of the motivations for defending vivisection—in the face of a torrent of criticism—from the mid‐1870s to the mid‐1880s. That defense was, in large part, orchestrated by Romanes.</p>

Needless to say, the controversy was not characterized by binary opposition, with uniform arguments on each side, but incorporated shades of argument and disagreement, both among scientists and among antivivisectionists. Nevertheless, those groups that cohered generally around Darwin (and his ideas) and Cobbe (and hers) can be thought of as the majoritarian groups and those that played the most significant public roles.</p>

         <title>REPUTATION, REPUTATION, REPUTATION</title>
         <p>Romanes was uniformly staunch in his public opposition to the antivivisection movement, his tone firm but measured. He joined the fray in a warm exchange with E. B. Nicholson, the author of <italic>The Rights of an Animal: A New Essay in Ethics</italic>, in the pages of <italic>Nature</italic> in 1879. Nicholson's book did not make a radically original contribution to the emergence of animal rights ethics and in fact relied heavily on John Lawrence's 1802 work, <italic>A Philosophical Treatise on Horses, and on the Moral Duties of Man towards the Brute Creation</italic>. Romanes himself noted that the book was “about a century too late in appearing.” He began from Nicholson's claim that a man has a moral right to kill harmful animals in order to better his own condition and inferred from it that he must “have a similar right to slay a harmless animal, if by so doing he can secure a similar end.” He then went on to offer a fairly standard defense of vivisection: “it is the opinion of all sufficiently informed persons that vivisection has been of more service in bettering the condition of humanity than has the destruction, say, of wolves, bears, and tigers, wherever these animals have been destroyed.”19</p>
         <p>Romanes's review in <italic>Nature</italic> was initially anonymous, but it suggested the pen of a physiologist. Recognizing a weak opponent, he took the opportunity preemptively to defend the practice of vivisection, allowing his motives to unfold in the correspondence that followed. Nicholson accused the reviewer of incompetence, which prompted Romanes to sign his response to demonstrate—in the manner of the gentleman—that there was “no personal animus” involved. Now revealed as a practicing physiologist, Romanes set out to prove physiology's moral status, an endeavor in which he obviously had a large personal stake. He anaesthetized Nicholson's logic, which had claimed both that the rights of animals were identical with those of men and that the fact that animals were bred specifically for the purpose of killing them morally justified the butcher, or the vivisectionist, in taking their lives. Romanes pointed out that if both of these claims were true then “a physiologist would be morally justified in vivisecting his own children on the plea that it was for this purpose that he had begotten them.”20 This conclusion served both to prove Nicholson's premises to be erroneous and to shore up the reputation of physiology's morality. They may have cut up animals, but physiologists were not animals themselves. Romanes was later to repeat this point when he reviewed a small book entitled <italic>Physiological Cruelty</italic>, written in response to Robert Lawson Tait's animadversions against vivisection and strongly in favor of the continued practice and scientific value of experimentation on animals. Applauding the book's “reasoned conclusions … equipped with armour of fact,” Romanes lauded the author as “something more (and may we not add, something better?) than a man of science and a logician. He is clearly a man of large and generous heart, of finely strung feelings, and a lover of animals as well as ‘a lover of men.’”21</p>
         <p>Romanes sought to stress a crucial distinction, which he retained in spite of his faithfulness to Darwinism. He pointed out that “man as an intellectual, moral, and social being has rights additional to those of a merely sentient being.”22 Physiologists—men of science and philosophy—served, through their practice of vivisection, to improve human society rather than to undercut it. As far as Romanes was concerned, it was an overestimation of the status of animals and a misunderstanding of physiology's humanitarian intent that led to the inverse view. Where he felt that this was easily demonstrable, he was alive to the possibilities that his position as a public figure afforded him to come to the defense of experimental science.</p>
         <p>Such was the case with Romanes's second public intervention on behalf of vivisection. By the early 1880s, antivivisection campaigns were organizationally rigorous. The most prominent abolitionist group was the Victoria Street Society, established in 1875, which by 1881 was publishing its own monthly antivivisection journal, the <italic>Zoophilist</italic>. The society's most prominent spokesperson was Frances Power Cobbe, who sought surgically to expose the rottenness in man's character, attacking animal experimentation by assaulting the morality of its male practitioners. In April 1881, spurred on by a published letter in which Darwin had defended vivisection in principle, Cobbe put the character of physiologists under the microscope and published her conclusions in the <italic>Times</italic>:
<disp-quote>
               <p>I beg to ask whether the principles of the evolution philosophy require us to believe that the advancement of the “noble science of physiology” is so supreme an object of human effort that the corresponding retreat and disappearance of the sentiments of compassion and sympathy must be accounted as of no consequence in the balance? Ought we to rejoice if a human being has spent a lifetime in the work (or, as some of us deem it, in the heinous sin) of the deliberate torture of God's harmless creatures, if, at the end of all he can boast that he has added a detail or two to the store of physiological facts? ... What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world of knowledge and lose his own heart and his own conscience?</p>
            </disp-quote>
Though he was not himself a physiologist, Darwin's character was impugned by association: as the most famous defender of vivisection, and the originator of the principles that Cobbe presumed to lie behind the arguments of vivisecting physiologists, Darwin bore the heaviest burden of responsibility. This letter, which was read not as an effort on behalf of animal rights but as an attack on a scientist's character, drew angry responses from the scientific community. Darwin himself chose only to correct Cobbe's selectivity in quoting from the report of the Royal Commission on vivisection.23 He was doubtless sensitive to the charges. Darwin did not vivisect, but he had certainly dissected, pickled, and skeletonized. In the minds of antivivisectionists, the aesthetic horrors of Darwin's earlier pigeon‐boiling exploits would have been ample reason for lumping him with the scalpel wielders. Having engaged in the process of raising fancy pigeons, with a thought to studying them outside and in, Darwin set about killing them with chloroform and potassium cyanide, afterward exposing their skeletons through crude methods. With these and other preserved animal bodies mounting up, even he admittedly thought he had created a “chamber of horrors,” the precise imagery later employed by the antivivisectionists.24 Cobbe's rejoinder, however, pushed the knife in a little deeper. In addition to implicating Darwin, she now reproached the callousness of the leading physiologist John Burdon‐Sanderson. She claimed that the charges against English vivisectionists in the course of the Royal Commission's deliberations were veiled in the “interchange of extreme politeness which took place between the commissioners and the ‘eminent men’ on whose doings they sat as judges.” With this sharp and conspicuous insertion of inverted commas, Cobbe peeled back the veneer of gentlemanly form and rhetorical eminence to reveal the “recklessness and callousness” of those with “a growing ardour for scientific curiosity.”25</p>
         <p>Romanes's two heroes in life were Darwin and Burdon‐Sanderson. He had worked closely with both of them, considered them his closest friends, and assumed a position of humility in their shadows. His worship of Darwin is well known; of Burdon‐Sanderson, Romanes's wife said that he was “the scientific friend George Romanes most valued and loved.”26 Sensitive to the feelings of his mentors at this public attack, Romanes rushed to defend them in print. He proclaimed the “principles of purest humanity” in Burdon‐Sanderson, at the same time declaring his own disinterestedness in the matter. The disinterestedness was disingenuous, but Romanes above all wanted to establish his own propriety. He testified only “in the interests of fair play.” Highlighting Cobbe's ignorance of this sportsmanlike virtue, Romanes clearly expressed what he thought was chiefly at issue in the vivisection debate: “our physiologists as a class are not less English gentlemen because they are highly cultured men of science.” The vivisection debates were often framed by the question of who was sufficiently informed to judge what was meant by scientific progress. For his part, Romanes was clear that those without firsthand experience of physiology and the physiological laboratory—most notably Cobbe herself—could not fairly comment on the value of animal experimentation. Since the men who did have this experience were also gentlemen, they were equipped to judge the progress of science with a social conscience as well as with a scientist's insight. It was English physiologists, according to Romanes, who “courted legislative restriction” of vivisection—and this in large part to dispel “suspicions cast upon themselves by the inflamed imaginations of unscrupulous agitators.” His response concluded with an unironic expression of his own love of animals.27</p>
         <p>Romanes was answered in the <italic>Times</italic> by the editor of the <italic>Spectator</italic>, Richard Hutton. A committed antivivisectionist, Hutton had served as a member of the Royal Commission of 1876 and had dissented from the majority, insisting on the inclusion of his own minority report regarding the commission's findings and suggesting more rigorous regulation. He protested strongly against Romanes's reduction of the complaints to a “will‐o'‐the‐wisp.” What pushed Hutton to respond was the notion that whereas “carelessness and callousness” might be present to a greater extent among “rude persons,” a much smaller amount of carelessness and callousness, “when justified and even extolled by men of high standing,” was “far more prolific of moral danger to the character of society at large.”28 Explicitly, then, he saw vivisection as a case of gentlemen being ungentlemanly—and thus putting society as a whole at risk.</p>
         <p>Romanes, in turn, exposed Hutton's own crass paternalism, arguing that the anguish of trapped rabbits was brought about by the “landed proprietors and ‘gentleman farmers’” who bred them, not by the “rude.” It was his turn to play with inverted commas. Romanes pointed out that “the clear‐headed anti‐vivisectors acknowledge that their efforts are being directed against a supposed moral danger to mankind rather than in favour of humanity to animals.” The remedy, therefore, was to demonstrate that these gentlemen really were behaving as gentlemen might be expected to behave. On this score, Romanes felt that the Royal Commission had already proven false “the huge and repulsive exaggerations wherewith a fevered sentimentality horrified the public.”29 Science could hold its head high.</p>
         <p>Tempers flared anew over the building of the physiology laboratory in Oxford for Burdon‐Sanderson in 1883 and 1884, and Romanes again found himself drawn into controversy. The debate took place amidst a long‐running battle about the place of science and medicine in the traditional classical curriculum (with its focus on character development), with particular concerns about the creation of a medical school in Oxford. H. W. Acland, Regius Professor of Medicine since 1857, believed strongly in the literary grounding of an Oxford education, to which were properly coupled the fundamentals of scientific training. Those who thereafter wished to pursue a medical education were to go elsewhere. The bitter and public dispute surrounding Acland's neglect of medical education was addressed in part by his appointment of Burdon‐Sanderson to the Waynflete Chair of Physiology in 1882, a move that paved the way for a medical school at Oxford.30</p>
         <p>E. A. Freeman, Regius Professor of History at Oxford, was not averse to casting moral judgments against activities that he thought were unbecoming of gentlemen, and he personally objected to vivisection being carried out under the auspices of the university. While willing to vouch for the vivisectionists in their attempts to relieve the sufferings of men, Freeman nevertheless doubted that any such advantage had been derived from experiments on animals. This misgiving led him to ask whether the pain inflicted on animals could be justified by an increase in knowledge. In this, he said, physiology was unique, for in no other branch of knowledge could a question of morality prefigure the means of study. Since physiologists set out without foreknowledge of the usefulness of their researches, it was unlikely that they could decide in advance which experiments were moral and which were not. The moral question, for Freeman, outweighed the potential fruits of discovery, and he favored the abolition of vivisection.31</p>
         <p>Romanes agreed that “no man, however eminent, can possibly foresee the results upon medicine and surgery of an extension of physiology,” but he was adamant that this did not prevent physiology from being considered “as morally far in advance of all the other sciences.” The reason: physiology worked on the principle of “inflicting a smaller measure of pain for the sake of preventing a larger.” Practical applications of research may not always be looked for, he acknowledged, but “a physiologist knows well enough that the discovery of practical results is necessitated by the very nature of his pursuits.” In making his claim that physiology was the only science that was “distinctly moral,” Romanes attempted to lure Freeman away from the “impressions created by the monstrously exaggerated accounts of the ordinary procedure of physiological research.”32 Romanes was speaking substantially of ethics, but he knew that he was fighting the image of the fallen man.</p>
         <p>Freeman and Romanes exchanged further blows along the same lines, and Romanes also attracted criticism from T. B. Clark, who proposed that he was engaged in “curious sophistry”—no doubt a stinging remark to “the Philosopher.” Realizing that persuasion was unlikely so long as “disputation runs up into an almost scholastic niceity [<italic>sic</italic>] of straw‐splitting,” Romanes again lamented that the distraction allowed the “gravest practical issues … to be obstructed.” Yet his final word for Freeman attempted to raise the tone: “I should be sorry if the correspondence between Mr. Freeman and myself were to close with any impression on his part of discourtesy on mine.”33 Academic disputes were to have no bearing on the conduct or public relations of gentlemen. What happened beyond the public gaze, however, was another story.</p>

                  <italic>Times</italic> (London), 23 Apr. 1881. Cobbe repeatedly asked what might happen to morality in the hands of materialists, worrying far more about the future of civilization (and the preeminence of humanity) than about the welfare of animals <italic>per se</italic>. In her clearest statement in this regard, Cobbe made Darwin's immoral influence most plain: “The truth is, that these modern Men of (merely physical) Science are so absorbed in their material researches that they have actually dropped out of sight all the moral and spiritual sciences together; and they go about in the footsteps of Mr. Darwin, endeavouring to gather the grapes of Morality off the thorns of Physics and Zoology. No such fruit grows on such trees. Spiritual truths are spiritually discerned, and moral truths are morally discerned, and neither the one or the other are to be got at through researches into things which are not spiritual and not moral. … Truly the ‘Humility of Science,’—of which we hear much, but see perhaps less than might be desired,—can be no better exemplified than by the choice of teachers made by these modest advocates of Vivisection, who relinquish Plato and Kant, Moses, and a greater than Moses, and make themselves the disciples of the wasp and the polecat.” Frances Power Cobbe, “The New Morality,” <italic>Zoophilist</italic>, 1884–1885, <italic>4</italic>:167–169, on pp. 168–169. In these sentiments, Cobbe joined a raft of other critics of Darwinism who were concerned that “the very basis of the civic order”—namely, “the metaphysical criterion for morality”—was being negated by Darwin and his “inner circle of friends and colleagues,” who “threatened to unleash a torrent of immorality and corruption that would surpass the scandalous vices of even the pagan world.” See Gowan Dawson, <italic>Darwin, Literature, and Victorian Respectability</italic> (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

         <title>PAINFUL OCCUPATIONS</title>
         <p>Behind the scenes, academic defenses were being coordinated with no mind to social niceties. Romanes worked tirelessly to uphold physiological methods of research. His occasional public contributions to the debate belie his industry in the increasingly professionalized corridors of gentlemanly science. As a good friend of John Burdon‐Sanderson, and as an up‐and‐coming physiologist himself, Romanes was invited to the first meeting of the Physiological Society, established by Burdon‐Sanderson in 1876 primarily to orchestrate the scientific response to antivivisection. At that meeting, Romanes was named one of the secretaries to the society.</p>
         <p>Romanes's work for the Physiological Society has tended to be underestimated.34 When his activities under the auspices of the society are framed by his public commentary and his private thoughts and actions, Romanes's strong motivation becomes clear. He was at least a willing adjutant, carrying out orders as if from his own personal and professional conviction; at most he was a “vivisecting major,” organizing the leaders of biology and medicine the better to defend their shared interests. It is important to recognize the significance of individual zeal if we are to gain a genuine impression of precisely how “an efficient campaign of self‐defence was organised by the scientists.” Stewart Richards notes that the campaign was “launched with the unanimous support of the IMC [International Medical Congress] and the British Medical Association (BMA) and quickly became a standard‐bearer in the wider movement concerned to propagate the prestige and authority, not merely of scientific medicine, but of science itself,” but this shift toward the appearance of a professionally organized body was steered in large part by gentleman amateurs such as Romanes.35</p>
         <p>If the network was only loosely bound, it did nevertheless encompass a shared notion of the common body, in two senses. First, a post‐Darwinian cosmology fostered a sense in which vivisection was thought certain to be useful, even if the fruits of laboratory research were not yet ripe for harvesting. The knowledge of common origin—the animal body's physiological similarities to the human body—justified the approach. Experimenters operated on the assumption of a positive outcome. The benefits would become self‐evident. Any qualms about butchery or torture, sensibilities to blood and gore, were dismissed by the investment of gentlemanly eminence, which would trump the calcifying effects of practice: if anyone could (or should) be doing this work, it was men of eminence, who were by their very natures men of <italic>feeling</italic>. And this points to the second common body. Although these gentlemanly practitioners were not necessarily connected formally, it was likely that they were connected personally and sympathetically. Together, they saw that the risks posed by vivisection were outweighed by the promise it offered of great leaps in knowledge, for the good of humanity: their scientific and philosophical attachment to human life and health allowed them to dismiss accusations of a lack of sentiment with regard to nonhuman life.36</p>
         <p>From the early years of the Physiological Society, the organization of countermeasures in the face of antivivisectionists' attacks was of paramount importance. These measures were to include publications from within the scientific community, which would itself be put on a more coherent and organized defensive footing.37 On behalf of the society, Romanes wrote forty invitations to foreign physiologists to attend the International Medical Congress in London in 1881. This vast assemblage of scientists and medical researchers was to prove a key platform for the launching of a provivisection campaign. The Physiological Section of the IMC resolved to place a resolution on vivisection before a general audience at the final meeting of the congress, and it fell to Romanes to gather the necessary signatures from the presidents and vice‐presidents of each section and from the vice‐presidents of the congress at large. He was also responsible for writing the resolution, which was read to those assembled for the general meeting by the Honorary Secretary‐General and met with loud applause: “That this Congress records its conviction that experiments on living animals have proved of the utmost service to medicine in the past, and are indispensable to its future progress. That, accordingly, while strongly deprecating the infliction of unnecessary pain, it is of opinion, alike in the interests of man and of animals, that it is not desirable to restrict competent persons in the performance of such experiments.”38 The resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
         <p>Coincident with the IMC, the Physiological Society had set Romanes the task of commissioning articles for a “campaign” to be staged in the pages of the popular journal the <italic>Nineteenth Century</italic>, where Romanes himself published many of his articles. These pieces were to be on the “value of physiological research,” and Romanes was also to prepare the editor, James Knowles, to accommodate the essays. Two of Romanes's commissioning letters survive. The first, to Charles Darwin, was a grand failure—and one that tested the bonds of friendship in the fire of professional obligation. Romanes wrote wearing his Physiological Society hat, apologizing for having to “dun” Darwin but claiming that “duty” left him no alternative. Explaining the Physiological Society's new strategy of speaking out on the subject of vivisection, Romanes detailed the plan to publish “a symposium‐like series of short essays by all the leaders of biology and medicine in this country—each to write on a branch of the subject chosen by himself or allotted to him by the society.” Romanes passed himself off as one acting under orders, writing through “tears,” but his self‐effacement seems disingenuous in the light of his other provivisection activities and in the context of the wording of the letter, which invited Darwin to “stand among this noble army of martyrs.”39</p>
         <p>Darwin hated the idea, deploring the very notion of a symposium, which he defined as a “drinking‐party.” He cautioned against the use of any semblance of humor on the subject and begged leave to decline the invitation, even though he recognized “the duty of … expressing his opinion publicly on vivisection.” He suggested that somebody quote his letter to the <italic>Times</italic> from earlier in the year and implored Romanes, “<italic>For Heaven's Sake</italic>,” to let this be sufficient.40</p>
         <p>The second letter was more successful—and a complete contrast in its style and tone. This time Romanes wrote to Richard Owen, mastermind of the Natural History Museum and fierce opponent of things Darwinian. The letter is strictly formal: Romanes was desirous of “learning [Owen's] views on the subject” and “Hoping to receive an affirmative reply.” Owen clearly ignored the letter until Romanes wrote again, asking him to commit. This letter is an example of occupational pragmatism, for Romanes certainly had no personal investment in soliciting favors from Darwin's archenemy. Owen's consent might be viewed in the same light: Andrew Rowan has described him as “temperamentally incapable of doing animal experiments,” claiming that his support for the cause was a response to the threat posed by antivivisectionists to the “profession.” Owen's biographer, Nicolaas Rupke, has gone further along these lines, pointing out his concern that antivivisectionist agitation would have “a direct bearing on the question of the scientists' social rank.” His agreement to write to defend vivisection was born from a fear that “any sort of restriction or supervision represented an infringement and a slur on an honourable class of men.”41</p>
         <p>Three essays, edited by Dr. Philip Henry Pye‐Smith, a prominent physiologist at Guy's Hospital, were eventually published in the <italic>Nineteenth Century</italic> in 1881 under a single heading. They succeeded in adding fresh fuel to the controversy.42 One of the principal subjects at stake was the question of pain. When scientists addressed antivivisectionist objections to animal experimentation, they dismissed them on three grounds. First, anesthetics mooted the issue of pain; second, any pain nonetheless caused an animal was necessary for the greater good to which physiological research led; third, it was probably the case that many animals could not feel pain at all. Romanes used all three objections at various points. He had said in 1881 that “the actual amount of animal suffering inflicted by vivisection … is a vanishing quantity,” going on to point out that “if there were such an instrument as an aesthometer wherewith to estimate the proportion [of pain], this amount of pain would be found overbalanced tens of thousands of times in the rat‐traps of London alone.” The use of anesthetics, then, took care of most of the objections that might be raised against vivisection. As for the rest, though he admitted that occasionally a “certain amount of pain is sometimes (though comparatively rarely) entailed,” he insisted that the sacrifice was small in light of the good accruing for the sake of humanity. Any objections to the contrary made on humanitarian grounds were mistaken. Indeed, one of the essay titles he suggested to Darwin when soliciting a contribution for the <italic>Nineteenth Century</italic> symposium was “Mistaken humanity of the agitation: real humanity of vivisection.”43 These sentiments echoed the IMC resolution, which deprecated only “unnecessary pain.” Yet in defending his own experiments Romanes tended to fall back chiefly on the third justification, which was haunted by the word “probably.” A jellyfish's capacity to suffer was certainly difficult to establish; but it was no easier to dismiss it altogether. Following Romanes's own experimental interests helps to clarify a vivisectionist's appreciation of a peculiar pain issue.</p>
         <p>From his earliest forays into physiological investigation, Romanes had been fascinated by jellyfish. He believed that understanding the nervous system of the medusa—if indeed one could be proven to exist—would shed light on the evolution of life processes. Many of his investigations involved cutting into these live animals, and, as such, the question of vivisection followed him throughout his career. As early as his talk at the Royal Institution in 1876, detailing the effects of alcohol on medusae, even <italic>Punch</italic> wondered if this was not “as shocking as vivisection.”44</p>
         <p>It seems likely that received opinion would have answered in the negative, and by 1884 Romanes was receiving encouragement from his colleagues. At the inaugural meeting of the Society for the Biological Investigation of the British Coasts, the Duke of Argyll noted that the society would “have the advantage of avoiding contact with the question of vivisection; for he supposed that even the most susceptible of anti‐vivisectionists would scarcely have their feelings touched by physiological experiments on jelly‐fish.”45 Romanes, who was present, thought otherwise. He would raise the moral question precisely because he thought he could reduce antivivisectionist arguments to absurdities. By this stage, his <italic>Jelly‐fish</italic> manuscript was well under way. In a polarized debate, Romanes would finally risk his name for the sake of his occupational self‐interest, coming out publicly to defend <italic>his</italic> work.</p>
         <p>In his introductory remarks to <italic>Jelly‐fish, Star‐fish, and Sea‐urchins</italic>, Romanes made it plain that “so far as the experiments which I am about to describe are concerned, there is not any reasonable ground for supposing that pain can have been suffered by the animals. And this it is easy to show.” In the event, however, it was not easy to show. Romanes proceeded along negative argumentative lines. “The animals in question are so low in the scale of life,” he said,
<disp-quote>
               <p>that to suppose them capable of suffering would be in the highest degree unreasonable. Thus, for instance, they are considerably lower in the scale of organization than an oyster, and in none of the experiments which I have performed upon them has so much laceration of living tissue been entailed as that which is caused by opening an oyster and eating it alive, after due application of pepper and vinegar. Therefore, if any one should be foolish enough to object to my experiments on the score of vivisection, <italic>a fortiori</italic> they are bound to object to the culinary use of oysters.46</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>He acknowledged that in arguing this way he did not prove his point. Rather than providing the “easy” proof, he proclaimed that his “sin” should be convincingly demonstrated by his critics, who would have to show that jellyfish and starfish felt pain. Convinced that the capacity to suffer could be established only through analogy, based on human experience, he saw no grounds for assuming this quality in “animals so low in the scale.” Consciousness was Romanes's chief category of distinction, and although he admitted that the point in nature where consciousness ceased was unknowable, he felt safe in asserting that even if it were present in a jellyfish, it would be of “a commensurately dim and unsuffering kind.” Concluding, he suggested that any “abhorrence” wrought by cutting into such “thin‐spun life” would be absurd.47</p>
         <p>Fortunately for Romanes, his critics were not close readers of his body of work. For not all of the lives on which he operated could have been described as “thin‐spun,” even by Romanes himself. In his 1884 work <italic>Mental Evolution in Animals</italic>, Romanes described an experiment in which the subject's degree of consciousness was not only not known but was in fact the particular object of the experiment. Introducing a pair of scissors to the immediate vision of a hermit crab, Romanes proceeded to snip off one of its “tentacles.” Having noted that “of course, the animal immediately drew back into the shell, and remained there for a considerable time,” Romanes repeated the experiment “till all the tentacles had been progressively cut away little by little,” in order to prove that the animal “never learnt to associate the appearance of the scissors with the effect which always followed it.”48</p>
         <p>At about the same time, although the details were not published until after Romanes's death, he was conducting experiments on reflex action, building on the work of Friedrich Goltz, with particular reference to scratching. He described removing the hind feet of rats and mice “before the animals were able to co‐ordinate their movements, and therefore before they had ever even attempted to scratch themselves.” Thereafter keeping the animals alive, Romanes noted that they attempted to scratch themselves “with their stumps as soon as they were capable of executing co‐ordinate movements, and afterwards continued to do so till the end of their lives with as much vigour and frequency as unmutilated animals.” The inability to satisfy an itch made no difference to their efforts: “the hereditary response to irritation by parasites … [was] so strong, that even a whole life‐time's experience of its futility made no difference in the frequency of the vigour thereof.” In this instance, Romanes was operating on animals that he himself had described as “highly intelligent,” filled with “wise caution,” “boldness and courage,” and “presence of mind”—words quite similar to his description of the intelligence of dogs. There is no evidence that Romanes himself operated on dogs and other domesticated animals, but there is little reason to suppose that this was because of any particular moral or sentimental compunction on his part. He must at least have witnessed such operations at University College, at the hands of Burdon‐Sanderson. Romanes does not give the impression of a “divided self,” “struggling,” in the words of Paul White, “to overcome instinctual sympathies for other creatures in order to fulfill commitments to a higher good.”49 He did not see any inconsistency between pet keeping and vivisection—a point to which we must return in due course.</p>
         <p>To some, no doubt, Romanes's authority on the question of pain was convincing, even though proof as to his subjects' capacity to suffer was not forthcoming. The <italic>American Naturalist</italic> republished his introductory words on vivisection in <italic>Jelly‐fish, Star‐fish, and Sea‐urchins</italic> in order to give “bearing on” the question of whether the “lower animals suffer pain.” Other reviews of that work expressed mixed feelings. The New York <italic>Critic</italic> observed that the “old‐fashioned humane sentiment, in its finical application to ‘all creatures great and small,’” was still in existence and demurred to answer whether Romanes had successfully removed their “last tender scruple.” While the review of the work in <italic>Science</italic> suggested that antivivisectionists ought to be put “in a receptive frame of mind” by Romanes's disclaimers, it is likely that the view of London's <italic>Literary World</italic> held sway with the sensitive society of lay readers: “to be shaved and scraped, cut in various directions, and painted with strong acids, is treatment which one would think could hardly have been very pleasant even to jelly‐fish and star‐fish.”50 In other words, Romanes's attempt to anticipate the antivivisectionist response to his work must be considered a failure, finding favor only in those places where he might well have expected to find it.</p>
         <p>The introduction to Romanes's 1885 work on jellyfish is exceptional as his only unprovoked publicly signed attack on the antivivisection movement. Given the timing, and given that this was Romanes's sole published work of physiology, this is perhaps unsurprising. In general, however, Romanes was well aware that anonymity could diffuse the harsh light of the public stage.51 It is worth speculating that he bolstered his public and professional contributions to the vivisection cause through an active anonymity. It seems likely, for example, that the background to his dispute with E. A. Freeman in the 1884–1885 controversy included some anonymous letter writing. That furor had been precipitated by a letter in the <italic>Times</italic> by “F.R.S.,” a moniker that Romanes himself used in the 1880s.52 I doubt that this particular letter was by Romanes—stylistically, it does not read like Romanes, and the writer uses a signing‐off phrase not typical of him—but I am persuaded that a later contribution, signed “Another F.R.S.,” was written by Romanes.53 It demonstrates how richly entangled were private sentiments with public issues. They could be negotiated under the public gaze, but only if under a veil.</p>
         <p>This letter addressed the bishop of Oxford, John Fielder Mackarness, who had published his own letter arguing that “pity for the suffering, whether of men or other animals, is a part, and a very noble part, of human nature.” He called for a “logical” position, in which vivisectors acknowledged that the only way to gain a “perfect knowledge of the secrets of the human frame” was by using “human victims,” which, he was assured, was a sacrifice forbidden by “feeling.” Such “feeling,” he argued, was precisely the same grounds for objecting to vivisecting animals. “Another F.R.S.” saw no logic in “inflicting possible pain and certain death upon a man ‘in the interests of mankind,’” since “the lower animals are, as all physiologists so well know, available for the purpose.” The letter then took a turn for the confessional. Physiologists were notorious for their agnosticism: the “new priesthood” railed against theism and the fallacies of Scripture under the banner of Darwin as it was waved by T. H. Huxley. Yet the reality was that many faced private spiritual struggles—and none more so than Romanes, whose scientific duties and affiliations were constantly being juggled with a personal sense of crisis about his own faith. This letter captured sentiments to which no hard‐line Darwinist could reasonably have attached his name: “In many of us, physiologists though we be, there is still a fixed belief that in some deep and dreadful sense the Almighty has fixed his canons against murder, and that we have an authority higher than mere sentiment for holding the life of a man to be immeasurably more sacred than the life of a sheep, or even than the lives of many sparrows.”54 Here is a glimpse into a private world of doubt, where morality was still determined more by Christian ethics than by natural law. For this vivisectionist, experimenting on animals for the sake of humanity was an act of the highest moral order, just as Romanes would later explain in the letters responding to Freeman. Yet there is expressed a doubt as to whether the image of a perfect gentleman fit with the persona of a materialist.55 Just as Romanes had refused to join Moncure Conway's Society of Liberal Thinkers (at Huxley's behest), worried that “the old landmarks in the territory of religious belief are now being hurried away at a rate which scarcely seems to call for any organized effort to ensure their more rapid destruction,” just as his theories of mind never quite escaped reference to a super mind, or supreme being, so Christianity ultimately influenced his scientific ethics. At the heart of his calling was a notion of humanity that increasingly prevailed over his theoretical leanings, and Romanes ultimately returned to the conviction that man occupied a special place in the universe, under God. Duties to mankind outweighed any considerations about other animals, for it was in man's relationship to God that Romanes ultimately sought the universe's “soul of loveliness,” which at the height of his materialist phase he feared lost.56 Despite the fears of the antivivisectionists, certain Darwinists clung to the structures of religious life in order to retain a grip on moral purpose. And here, amidst the buzz of the increasingly organized machinery of professionalizing science, could still be heard the voice, however faint, of the gentleman amateur.</p>
         <p>Whether or not the “Another F.R.S.” who wrote this letter defending vivisection was Romanes, the device of anonymity serves as an indicator of the limits to which gentlemen could go in publicly professing their private thoughts. Public fuses could be lit, ethical doubts raised, from the relative safety of anonymity. Controversy, to which Romanes would not proactively sign his name, could be initiated. The gentleman and the scientist were at the beginning of a process of disharmony. Whereas the inner circles of the scientific community still afforded the philosophical, “evenhanded, disinterested consideration of rival positions,” the professional scientist now had to defend his work from outside attack or face the real possibility of further legislative imposition.57 Romanes's choice of anonymity suggests that in his private world he still identified more readily with the idea of the gentleman scientist. But the behind‐the‐scenes professional work of men like Romanes took place in a world of activity beyond traditional gentlemanly public life. Networks constructed through personal familiarity now also took on the appearance and structures of professional collegiality. The unified voice of the physiologists on the issues of pain and experimental research was reached through person‐to‐person coordination and relied on the efforts and commitment of individuals charged with that duty. How many of the roots of these professional machinations and public declarations can we expect to find bound up with private life and private affections? The answer to this lies in the extent to which experimental research was a part of day‐to‐day domestic life.</p>

                  <italic>Times</italic> (London), 16 Jan. 1885. Freeman attacked the “learned” for obfuscating the merits (or otherwise) of vivisection through their use of anatomical jargon. He referred to a letter signed “F.R.S.” that had appeared in the <italic>Times</italic> the month before (16 Dec. 1884); it extolled the virtues of vivisection for the gains it afforded human brain surgeons, so that a man in Regent's Park hospital had had a tumor removed successfully. This letter was the principal reference point for the flood of letters that followed through January and February 1885.

               <p>This was consistent with a certain interpretation of Darwinian cosmology. While the opponents of vivisection pointed to the amoral individualism of Darwinian morality—a struggle for survival in which altruism had no place (see, e.g., Frances Power Cobbe, “Darwinism in Morals,” in <italic>Darwinism in Morals and Other Essays</italic> [London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1872])—the practitioners of experimental medicine drew on Darwin's anthropocentric optimism about humanity's future, with its social instincts of sympathy and love combined with “the intellectual ability to reflect on one's past behaviour, the linguistic ability to communicate and understand communal approval and disapproval, and the power of hereditary transmission of habits and instincts”: Thomas Dixon, <italic>The Invention of Altruism: Making Moral Meanings in Victorian Britain</italic> (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2008), p. 140. What Dixon calls “the casual manner in which Darwin proposed that happiness be replaced by health as the proper end of human endeavours,” combined with the strong motif in the <italic>Descent</italic> of man as the highest being, progressively moving toward perfection, accounts for the motives of medical science (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 175). Darwin demonstrated that the Great Chain of Being had, by a natural process, placed man at the summit and that this supremacy could, through the social cultivation of the human instincts of sympathy and filial concern, be reinforced. (For the problem of resolving the tension in Darwin's work between individualism and the development of a moral sense with regard to others see <italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 129–151, 175–180.)</p>

In one of his most famous passages, Romanes lamented: “whether I regard the problem of Theism on the lower plane of strictly relative probability, or on the higher plane of purely formal considerations, it equally becomes my obvious duty to stifle all belief of the kind which I conceive to be the noblest, and to discipline my intellect with regard to this matter into an attitude of the purest scepticism. And forasmuch as I am far from being able to agree with those who affirm that the twilight doctrine of the ‘new faith’ is a desirable substitute for the waning splendour of ‘the old,’ I am not ashamed to confess that with this virtual negation of God the universe to me has lost its soul of loveliness.” Romanes's work after this point can be viewed as an attempt to integrate science and religion, and he returned to the faith by the end of his life.</p>

         <title>PRIVATE OPERATIONS</title>
         <p>In 1878, Charles Darwin's son Francis jokingly recommended that Romanes “keep an idiot, a deaf‐mute, a monkey and a baby” in his house, that he might compare their intellectual capacities. By 1880, Romanes was halfway to realizing this experimental menagerie. If it were not for his wife's sensibilities, he would certainly have been making notes on the interactions between his child and his newly acquired chimpanzee. Darwin, on this occasion, chided him, remarking that “Mrs Romanes is quite right not to allow the monkey to enter the nursery, for how dreadful it would be if the monkey received more attention than the baby.”58</p>
         <p>Though Romanes planned only to observe the chimp, not to cut it up, there can be no doubt that animal experimentation was at the heart of his domestic life. It took place in his house, impacted his closest private relations, and consumed his time. We can assume from the letter with which this essay began that his pet cats as well as his dog went the way of the knife.59 Romanes's spirit of inquiry colored everything that he did, from observations of his new child, which he referred to as “it,” in 1880, to noting the vibrations of jellyfish as he teased them with a scalpel. At home, the gentleman was husband, father, and friend, but he was no less a scientist. The separation of public and private is rhetorically convenient but unfaithful to the complexity of the life of a late Victorian gentleman. There is a wealth of documentary evidence on the vivisection controversy, from intimate personal communications to public political transcripts. Yet it would be a mistake to attempt to divide the evidence “into traces of personal life and traces of social life,” for “all such documents are at one and the same time the record <italic>both</italic> of purposive cognitive projects at the individual level <italic>and</italic> of argumentative interactions at the social level.”60 Through his portrayals of gentlemanly character and through anonymity—in attempting to defend others' reputations and his own—Romanes sought to keep the appearance of the public/private distinction intact. The historian collapses the distinction: Romanes's private world influenced his public role, which in turn fed back into his private life.</p>
         <p>What come across in Romanes's private thoughts on vivisection are his acerbic opinions of the opposition and the caustic humor he shared with his friends and allies. Romanes eagerly wrote Darwin about his travails, and they shared sardonic comments about those whom they could not count on for support. Romanes still occupied a scientific world constructed largely of informal networks, where character and conduct were, as Jim Endersby states, “as important as any practical or formal credentials.” Romanes must have abhorred the irreverent attacks of outsiders who knew nothing of the mores of scientific communication that they were helping to usher out. He spared them no mercy in private communications. His only failure during his industrious gathering of signatures at the International Medical Congress in 1881 was relayed to Darwin thus: “The only refusal to sign came appropriately enough from the president of the section ‘Mental Diseases.’” His poor opinion of antivivisectionists chimed well with Darwin's frank assessment of “the sweet miss Cobbe,” whom he labeled a “liar” while exclaiming to the heavens over the butchering he had received from her pen in the <italic>Times</italic>. Romanes had been of the opinion that Cobbe “had more wit than to adopt such a tack and tone,” and both men seemed well satisfied that Darwin's “stirring up the mud” on vivisection had helped the cause. So frank were the two friends when they talked in private that Darwin had to remind Romanes that their thoughts on vivisection should be veiled in the company of the rest of Darwin's family. As early as 1877, Darwin thought it prudent to warn Romanes not to talk about experiments on animals when “in presence of my ladies … as they will be horrified.”61</p>
         <p>Darwin's warning suggests the complexity of private life for the gentleman scientist. Both Darwin and Romanes carried out much of their scientific work at home, and their labors were certainly not unknown to their families. The separation of space within the domicile must have been blurred at best. Professional life carried on within private dwellings, and in large part public life was orchestrated there too. The Physiological Society was established at John Burdon‐Sanderson's house on Queen Anne Street, and thereafter meetings rotated among the homes of the scientist members, including Romanes's house at 18 Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park. The large group of men (nineteen attended the first meeting) must have tested the capacity of the townhouse parlor, and their presence would certainly have had some bearing on the other occupants of the house. Romanes surely became acquainted with the wives of his fellow scientists, for he attended most of the meetings between 1876 and 1881 in his capacity as secretary, and he must have been accustomed to talking about vivisection in domestic settings.62 Darwin's warning was not, therefore, a reminder that work should not be discussed at home but, rather, an acknowledgment that home was the usual venue for talking shop. His request that Romanes avoid any mention of vivisection in the presence of his “ladies” was the exception to the rule.</p>
         <p>Romanes's activities against the antivivisectionists were likely motivated directly by his need to maintain and honor his private relationships with Darwin and Burdon‐Sanderson. Romanes had a personal interest in Burdon‐Sanderson's cause in the matter of the construction of the physiology laboratory at Oxford. He eventually moved there, in 1890, in order to make use of the facilities. Not only was Burdon‐Sanderson a firm friend (they holidayed together in Scotland, carrying out experiments of mutual interest); he was also able to facilitate Romanes's own research. Though he lacked an academic appointment, Romanes was nevertheless ultimately ushered into the Oxford community.63</p>
         <p>As for Darwin, the enthusiasm for the shared cause was matched only by the recoil from it when Romanes sensed that he had gone too far. After Darwin's refusal to write an article for the 1881 “symposium,” Romanes hastened to respond (having removed his Physiological Society hat) in a contrite tone. He wished to “relieve” Darwin's mind and to apologize for having written coincidentally with the death of Darwin's brother, Erasmus. As a friend, he should have known that Darwin, despite everything, shied away from controversy. Six weeks after his original letter, Romanes was still placating Darwin—and framing his contrition with humble and affectionate compliments. “The vivisection fight does not promise well,” he said. “Like yourself, most of the champions do not like the idea.” The same letter reassured Darwin that Romanes's recent review of his book on earthworms was in earnest, despite Darwin's suspicions that he had been overrated. “If I am so uniformly stupid as to ‘over‐estimate the value of all you do,’” Romanes said, “it is at any rate some consolation to know that my stupidity is so universally shared by all the men of my generation.”64 Thus the loyal student retreated to his subordinate place under his great mentor. He would not “dun” Darwin again.</p>
         <p>Romanes thought carefully about what the life of a private gentleman should be. He even wrote on the subject. Gentlemen “at large without occupation,” the idle rich, were the “most objectionable of creatures.” Work established the substance of a gentlemanly life and made possible the definition of worthwhile recreation. Romanes wrote autobiographically of the need for occupation and of the joys of eclectic tastes. He worked incessantly but always found time to shoot or write poetry. He objected strongly to specialization in anything, complaining that it led to divisions avoided in the spirit of amateurish participation. He was probably alarmed at the rise of the career scientist, as he continued to dabble at everything. His domestic life was arranged accordingly. Wife, children, novels, scientific experiments, poetry, letter writing (professional and private), book writing—all took place under one roof (or, rather, two, as he moved between London and Scotland).65 Ever present were his dogs, which he held in high esteem.</p>
         <p>Not all the animals in Romanes's domestic setting were there for the purposes of study. Indeed, Romanes was a self‐styled lover of animals, and he doted particularly on his dogs. As a keen shooter (he saw no contradiction between being an animal lover and shooting at game), Romanes depended on the fidelity and skill of his canine companions. Two of his sonnets, in which hunting glories past are recalled as shared experiences, were written for his dogs. He saw in his dogs “eyes that glow in love” and recognized in them an “Intelligence that might become a man!” On the death of Countess, a beloved setter, Romanes reflected that it mattered not that dog and master could not engage in shared thoughts, since they shared “that greater life of love” that he thought particular to the relation between humans and dogs.66 These were private thoughts, published posthumously. They betray an affectionate streak that to our eyes may seem at odds with the cold cuts of the vivisectionist.</p>
         <p>Yet there is no contradiction. Little evidence can be mustered, in Romanes's case, to accord with White's claim that physiologists were able, “on entering the laboratory, to mobilize their curiosity, stem the tide of sentiment, and perform like well‐tuned instruments for the pursuit of truth and medical mercy.”67 Romanes did not “self‐legitimize” in this way, and in any case the dividing line between laboratory and elsewhere was not always clear. His curiosity was always mobilized, his pursuit of truth active at all times. These things defined his love for animals as much as his desire to experiment on them. Romanes was a lover of nature; and one expression of that love was his dissection of it, sometimes when it was still alive. His higher purpose—the cause of humanity—was not reserved for his research but shot through his entire way of life. This brings us back to the question of vivisecting Major. It seems certain that Major had been a pet, but Romanes genuinely thought that having him vivisected was the most useful, and therefore the most moral, thing he could do with him. Then, as now, some would point to this as an act of remarkable callousness—a proof of the hardness of heart wrought by too frequent exposure to the spilling of blood. But Romanes would certainly have palled at charges of insensitivity. His was one of the more active, more acutely sensitive consciences in Victorian society. He simply could not see the cruelty in vivisection, for if he could not entirely guarantee its painlessness thanks to anesthesia he could at least point to the subjects' likely lack of sensitivity or, at worst, justify any pain they felt as necessary for the greater good. He understood vivisection as humanism, carried out with the highest moral intentions. Romanes may have felt a touch of sadness. He certainly did not deny that animal pain was real, but when it was put into the balance with human pain there was no contest.</p>
         <p>Fittingly, the man to whom Romanes sent Major, Edward Schäfer, reviewed Romanes's memoirs after his premature death in 1894. The review read more like a character reference: Romanes had a “simple child‐like nature,” with “unvarying good humour” and a “gentle disposition.” In him they were “combined … with the highest intellectual attainments; qualities which won for George Romanes the affectionate regard of all who were privileged to know him.”68 As a public figure, Romanes guided himself through the ruptures of professionalizing science by means of private sentiment, following the imperative—the duty—to experiment while clinging to prevailing notions of honor, propriety of conduct, Christian justification, and personal friendship: in short, through gentlemanly amateurism. Rather than seeing the emergence and flourishing of the scientific professional as distinct from the continued presence of the gentleman amateur, we can identify, through Romanes, the complex relation of both in the occupational tensions faced by individual practitioners.69 Jim Endersby has noted that the “identification of profession with disinterestedness and public duty represents perhaps the most important of the values that were transferred from the eighteenth‐century idea of the gentleman, via the mid‐nineteenth‐century term ‘philosophical,’ to become part of the professional ethics of the late‐nineteenth/early‐twentieth‐century professional scientist.” Indeed, Gowan Dawson has pointed to the “extremely precarious process” and vital importance of “maintaining an unsullied personal reputation,” for science's intellectual credibility still “relied upon the virtuous character of its leading individual exponents.”70 This “process” was undertaken by Romanes, straddling the transition from gentleman to professional, maintaining his personal and scientific respectability. The vivisection controversy, seen through the eyes of such a man, gains a rich complexity otherwise lost in the rhetoric of a polarized public debate.</p>
