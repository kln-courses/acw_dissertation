<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEME OF CHURNING OF THE OCEAN IN INDIAN AND KHMER ART by A. K. BHATTACHARYYA Deputy Keeper , National Museum, New Delhi , India In the cultural migrations from India towards further east and south-east, Cambodia was perhaps one of the earliest to play the host among a few countries geographically and ethnically falling in together. With Puranic ascendancy during the early medieval period, Saivite, but more so, the Vaisņavite themes gained ground in both India and her cultural expansions. During the seventh century, while north India was under the Vaisņa- vite rule of the predecessors of Harsa, we have the staunch Saiva convert in Mahendra- varman I, the Paliava, a powerful cultural force in the south. With the successors of Mahendra, and the ultimate emergence of the Cholas, specially under the great Rājarāja I and Rājendra Chola, cultural explorations were carried on with success resulting in the great upsurge, culturally speaking, of a unified Brahmanic kingdom, as it were, in the south and south-east of Asia. With the cult of Devarāja established by the Brahman Hiranyadama, a period of grand architectural undertakings was launched in Kamboja by Jayavarman II (802-869 A.D.). Hailing from Java, the latter initiated Banteai Chmar and others, to mark the epoch of grand Khmer styles of architecture. Indeed his successive attempts at experiment in three capitals of the kingdom supplied the necessary impetus for structural grandiosity which was followed up in the succeeding reigns. Already in the eighth century, nearer home in Java, a height of achievement was reached in structural and sculptural compositions in Bārābudur. The strong Brahmanic influence, manifest in its Puranic aspect, continued well into the reign of Jayavarman Ill's successor, Indravarman I (877-889 A.D.) who brought into being Bakong, one of the first terraced structures, a characteristic architectural device of this part of East-Asia. In fact, the over-whelming and pervading Brahmanic cult in Kamboja did not stop here but rather penetrated well into the tenth century, when in its first few years we have yet another great builder, Yasovarman (889-910 A.D.), the founder of Angkor Thom. No less important was, again, the sphere of cultural influence that extended to Kamboja in the 9th century from the Sumatran capital, Srïvijaya, specially in the first three quarters of that century. Here in India, contemporary with this great ARTS ASIATIQUES 16</page><page sequence="2">122 A. K. BHATTACHARYYA mission of Puranic Hinduism in outer spheres, was the Kanauj empire under Bhoja, the champion of Brahmanic culture. This, by a strange coincidence of cultural history of countries, was largely marked by the successes of the Cholas in the south, noted for their political as well as cultural missions in and out of India. So far as the reactions to this cultural conquest are concerned it is interesting to note that while Buddhism in Sumatra was largely established much earlier, specially in the time of king Balaputradeva with his contemporary in India, the great Pāla king of staunch Buddhist persuasion, king Devapāla of Puņdravardhana, Kamboja continued to be under the spell of neo-Brahmanism of the Purāņas till much later, the first Buddhist king of Kamboja being Suresavarman I (1002- 1049 A.D.), who even continued to build and dedicate orthodox Hindu shrines. The theme of the churning of the ocean, it must be remembered, is a long continuous allegory wherein all the important deities of the Brahmanic pantheon and its hierarchy come into play. It is, further, symbolically representative of an ascendancy of Brahmanism itself. It is the triumph of the cult-forces of Puranic resurgence that is symbolised by the ultimate victory and deathless continuance, the amrtatvam , of the devas . And, therefore, it is naturally born and shaped in sculpture in India, the country of its conception, and nourished and nurtured in that of its foster-mother, like Kamboja and Java-dvīpa, immediately following. As we have seen above, by a happy coincidence, the great epoch of Brahmanic revival in India is also the most powerful period of its penetration and stabilization in Kamboja. It is no wonder, therefore, that sculptural representations of such themes start from about 7th-8th cents, or perhaps a little earlier and continue down into the 12th- 13th cents. A.D. One of the earliest specimens showing this theme in India, ascribed (1) to the 7th cent. A.D. on stylistic grounds, is carved on a lintel from vili. Jhevarhedi, 16 miles south of Hardwar (U. P.), and now preserved in the Gurukull Kangri Museum at Hardwar. In this sculpture while there are eight devas (gods) represented, only one asura (demon) stands for their group. Symbolising a grand revival of Brahmanism in India, as we have noted already, this sculpture, peculiarly enough, represents the asura in « a conical kulah cap » with a trimmed beard and short pointed cheek-bones, recalling a Sassanian type. Here the body of the serpent is coiled twice around the churning stick which is placed in a ghala put on a mountain below which rests on the back of the tortoise. In the rock-cut caves of Badāmi, distt. Bijapur, we have also representations of this theme in the Vishnuite cave no. Ill on the entrance lintels of different cells. Badāmi which was a great centre of Brahmanic influence in the 8th-9th centuries A.D. naturally was the fittest ground for a delineation of this subject of wider significance. Here in three successive panels in front of the door-ways, the three scenes, two relating to the prologue and the other, representing the feat of the churning, are given expression to. In the first panel (fig. 1), the devas (gods) are shown engulfed in deep grief for their defeats (1) V. S. Agrawala, Journal of the U . P. Historical Society , 1951-52, vol. XXIV-V, pp. 203 if.</page><page sequence="3">i. - Badāmi. Cave III (Cliché A.S.I.) at the hands of the demons. Here the central figure, viz., that of Brahma, with his four faces is seen touching his left knee pondering over the ways and means to bring about success for the devas. To his right is probably Indra touching his chin with one of his right hands brooding over his defeats, and showing vajra (thunder-bolt) in his other left hand. One of his right hands shows the ańkuśa (elephant-goad) while the inner right hand rests on his right knee. Beside him, to his right, is a four-armed figure, probably representing Agni, the Fire-god, who, according to the Puranic texts, led the deputation of the celestials to Brahma. There are three more figures to the right and five to the immediate left of Brahma, which all represent the other deities who approached Brahma for advice in their calamity. According to the narration in the Vimu Purāņa (i), Brahmā was approached by Indra and others, led by Agni. The other deities in the group which went to seek the help of Visņu, on the advice of Brahmā, included Siva accompanied by the Rudras, Pūsā ie., Sun-god accompanied by the Ädityas, Agni accompanied by the subsidiary fire-gods, as also the twin-gods, Aswins, the Vasus, the Maruts or Wind-deities, and Indra (2). In the 2nd panel, the premier scene shows (fig. 2) a pair of devas clasping Fig. 2. - Badāmi. Cave III (Cliche A.S.I.) (1) Cf. Visņu Puraņa , Oriental Press, Bombay, 1889, p. 30 //.

K. BHATTACHARYYA the tail-part of the Serpent, and one figure representing the asuras . The next scene presumably corresponds to the episode of the fatigue of the churners and their inability to manage to turn the floating Mandarãchala , and their encouragement by Brahma and ultimate prayer and request to Visņu to help them in holding Mandara firmly. In the panel of five figures seated, the second one definitely represents Brahma with three of the four faces visible, the next to the right obviously is Visņu with mukuia (crown) seated in sukhāsana , with the right upper hand holding aksamãlã (rosary of beads), the right lower being placed on the right knee, the left upper holding the chakra ( ?) in profile, and left lower, the lotus. The two figures to farther right, whom it is difficult to identify in the absence of any characteristic attributes, are verily in the pose of explaining their difficulties to the central figure of the scene, viz., Visņu. The next scene, the final in this series, shows the renewed performance of the churning. Here Mandara is being held firm by Visņu with one of his left hands, while the other left holds the chakra ; beyond him is another figure, presumably a deva . Visņu, according to the Purāņas (i), helped the devas to pull Vāsuki, the Serpent, in one of his forms, while in another, he similarly aided the asuras , but in a third, more majestic yet invisible form, held the Mandara firm. To the other side of the Mandara is the sole figure of a demon with a boar's face holding the mouth-side of the Serpent, while on the top of Mandara is shown Srī, the goddess of Fortune, in bust, with folded hands. In the 3rd panel (fig. 3), there are eight figures each, of the demons and gods, on the two sides respectively of Mandara, which is placed on the Tortoise representing cosmic energy. Srī is, again, featured here above Mandara, the churning stick. Vāsuki, the Serpent, is given here a human head with a kirlla (crown) with seven hoods over his head and is richly ornamented with key āra , valaya^ and hãra . He is lying with folded hands ( añjali ) close to his breast. A similar scene (fig. 4) is also depicted on a lintel in cave no. II, where a group of ten devas and nine asuras are shown. Of the devas , the nearest to Mandara seems to be Visņu with his attributes in the four Fig. 3. - Badāmi. Cave III ( Cliché A. S.I.) (1) Ibid. Cf. Rüpenänyena devānām madhye Cakragadãdharah.

Behind him is Indra with his four hands, the upper right one of which clearly holds the ańkuśa. Here in addition to Šrī shown with folded hands above Mandara, we have the figure of Uchchaihsravas, the divine horse, shown in the left lower part. Mandara is placed, as usual, on the Tortoise. In the art of the early Châlukyas this motif finds expression in the form of pillar details from the well-known Virūpāksa temple dedicated to Siva-Lokesvara by the queen of Vikramaditya II. This temple assigned to about 740 A.D. is one of the finest of the early Châlukyan art built in close imitation of the Kailāsanātha temple at Kānchīpuram. The temple shows mainly representations of Siva and scenes from the Rãmãyana. The cosmic theme of the Churning of the ocean which is also figured here (fig. 5) is symbolic of the great Brahmanic stronghold that the region was round about the 8th century. Here in one of the top panels the Churning scene is depicted with one of the asuras repre- senting their clan holding the mouth of the Serpent Vasuki as also helping to entwine it around the Churning pillar, Mandara. Figure of Sürya in anthropomorphic form is depicted on the top, behind the Mandara, with the discus of the Moon shown at the corner representing the Moon-god. Three representatives of the devas are shown at the other side of the churning stick which is placed on a full-blown lotus on the figure of the Tortoise. At the lower panel the Churning feat is shown as in progress with four representatives of the devas to the left shown as holding the tail and four of the asuras to the right as holding the head-side of the Serpent. Kāmadhenu (Divine Cow), Airāvata (the Divine Elephant), Šrī in full standing form, are shown as the treasures coming out from the performance of the churning, and reliefed to the right. To the left stands the Divine Horse, Uchchaihsravas. Possibly the figure in bust of the churning stick Mandara is shown at the centre at the lower part of which is the Serpent. This early sculpture from an area of Paliava influence is a strong evidence of the popularity of this theme in this part of Southern India which is noted for its being a Brahmanic strong hold in the successive ages. One of the earliest temples of Chitorgarh in Rãjasthan dateable perhaps to the 10th- 11th century, now known as Kalka Mātā temple, contains one of the early sculptures showing this theme of the churning of the ocean. This sculpture (fig. 6) which is set in a niche on one of the outer surfaces of the temple shows shows the Mandara placed on Fig. 4. - Badāmi.

The composition is set on a lotus and on the top of the Mandara is a seated figure presumably of Laksmī with hands folded in añjali. On one side of it is a figure of an asura and on the other that of a deva, with a few celestial figures on both sides. At the back over the scene of churning there are groups of deities watching the feat. One of the figures down below to the right is presumably of a deva holding the tail of Vasuki. In style and composition it is typically of an early Rājasthani school of sculpture and a precursor of the products of medieval Western India. While the delineation of the human figures is somewhat stiff and formal, face angular, arms sharply bent, the column of the Mandara octagonal and the figure of the Kūrma (Tortoise), with its head turned upwards, fairly conventional, some of the features such as the lotus, the full- jar and the general ornamentation are such that it marks very well the period of transition between the late Gupta and the medieval styles in Western India.

Late in origin, the carving on this lintel has some peculiar iconographie features. Here similarly as in the earlier sculpture from Hardwar only a single figure of an asura represents the demons while another on the other side stands for the devas . The most interesting feature, viz., that of the figure of Sri as Mohinī, which bears a large correspondence with the Purānic description of the episode of Sri, the consort of Nārāyaņa Visņu, in this connec- tion. The figure is shown in the full bloom of her youth, charming, and giving out an expression of poise and composed bliss as required by the literary descriptions. She is crowned and has a tiara and a hara , and is seated cross-legged on the Cosmic Tortoise. Describing her peculiar function of overwhelming the world of gods and men by her charms, the Kūrma Purāņa (1) says, in the words of Visņu : Iyarh sã parama Sākti r-manmayī Brahma-rūpiņī Mãyã mama priyãnantã yayedam dhãryate jagat / / anayaiva jagat sarvarh sadevãsuramãnwam mohayãmi dvijasrestha ! grasãmi visrjãmi ca // utpattim pralayam caiva bhãtãnãmãgatim gatim vidy aya vîksya cãtmãnam taranti vipulāmimām // asyãstvarhsãnadhis Ihãya saktimantďbhavan surāh Brahmaesãnãdayah sarve sarvasaktiriyam mama 1 1 saisā sarvajagatsūtih prakrti striguņātmikā prāgeva matto saň jātā Srih kalpe padmavāsinī // caturbhujā śańkha-cakra-padma-hasta sraganvitā koļisūryapratīkāsā Mohinī sarvadehinām // nāham devā na pitar 0 mānavā Vāsavo'pi ca mãyãmeatãm samiittartum ye cãnye bhuvi dehinah 1 1 In our sculpture, although she is not four-armed but has only padma (lotus) in her right hand, out of the four attributes of hers stated in the Puranic text, her personal charms brought out in the stone stone carving are really commensurate with her function of capti- vating as Maya, all including Vasava. She is said also to have been created out of the energy of Visņu himself, and with her, further, Nãrãyana is to create and destroy, for, she finally, represents his all-energy ( sarva-sakti ). It is an interesting feature of our sculpture that four elephants are depicted below the cosmic tortoise, out of the eight intended on all the sides. These represent the Eight Dig-gajas or Elephants of the Quarters, according to Brahmanic cosmology. There is an interesting verse quoted by the Sãhitya-darpana (2) of Kavirāja Gos wami of the 14th cent. A.D. in illustration of the figure of speech, arthãn - taranyãsa , which aptly describes the functions of the tortoise and the Eight Dik-kuñjaras (1) Kürma Purãna, Venkateswara Press, Bombay, p. i if., chap.

According to the Matsya Purāņa , Indra, Sùrya, Rudra, Vasus and Guhyakas headed the devas , while, of the asuras , Vipracitta, Namuchi, Vrtra, Samvara, Dvimūrdhā, Vagrudamstrā, Rāhu, Bali, etc., were prominent and faced the mouth of Sesa. In the upper panel seated extreme left seems to be Rudra with a serpent as the upavīta across the chest. The figures in the upper panel are celestials borne across the sky on the vehicle of swans as sculptured here. Mandara, as in Indian depiction, is placed on the ghala which in turn rests on the cosmic Tortoise. Stylistically the sculpture must be assigned to the pre-Buddhistic period as certainly not being the product of the creative extravagance of Khmer art in the n-i2th centuries of the Christian era. In fact, the features of our sculpture bears the closest relationship to the art of Pràsàt Khna Sen Kéo. More precisely, it perhaps belongs to a period after Jayavarman II (802-869 A.D.) or more certainly well into the period of Jayavarman III (869-877 A.D.), his successor. Our sculpture marks a definite early stage of a simpler head-dress, a less stylised form of the garments and a general flatness of figures that stand apart (1) from the intricately wrought ornamentation as in the sharp protruding muku tas and a general sharpness of features, noticed in the Pràsàt Prei group of sculptures of the eleventh-twelfth cents. In details of composition, however, our sculpture has some similarity with those on a lintel, in sitù , from Pràsàt Sneng West which, stylistically, belongs much later to about the 13th century (2). As here, in the Pràsàt Sneng lintel too, the sculpture is divided into two panels, in the upper one of which, the devas are represented watching the great event. The latter period (ie., I2th-i3th Cents. A.D.) represent the zenith of Khmer art and is characterised by an individuality and bears only a distant semblance to its originals of remote past in India (3). For instance, the coiffure of Sri in our sculpture illustrated here is just in the manner of an apsaras (4), and her hands are joined in añjali . Speaking of the symmetry of placement of šrī generally in the sculptures from Kamboja, Madeleine Giteau says (5) : « Généralement Vapparition de Çrî est symétrique de celle d'Utchtchaihsravas », and in our example from Kamboja, too, this holds true. Uchchaihsravas is shown on the other side of Mandara to keep balance in the entire composition. She is symbolically represented by a lotus (6) in a scene of this theme at Pràsàt Kuk Daung, where the horse is shown very lively and trotting. At Präh Eńkosei, another figure, viz., that of Kāmadhenu, the divine cow as a product of the churning, is shown in a sculpture on a lintel at the south sanctuary (7).

BHATTACHARYYA In the epoque of Baphuon, the composition of the theme of the churning of the ocean in the 2nd half of the nth cent, is highly stylised and formal. This scene at Angkor Vat in the façades at Präh Vihear, Thommanon, Baiìteai Samrè, two lintels at Präh Pithu where the depiction is highly stylised, represents a wide range of variations. Here in India, belonging to the Chandellas, is another sculpture : assignable to the nth-i2th cents. A.D., now preserved in the British Museum which represents the scene of the churning in the upper corner of a Visņu image. The great churning stick, Mandara, represented by a shaft has a group of three figures on the left, probably standing for the asuras as holding the thicker side of the body near the mouth of the Serpent, and has one figure on the other side which obviously represents the devas . Mandara is placed on the Tortoise and Sri-devi is shown coming out with her hands clasped in añjali , being sculptured on the Tortoise and in front of the mountain shaft. In a sculpture from Bodoh, distt. Bhilsa, Madhya Pradesh, now preserved in the Gwalior Museum, the scene is represented in a very interesting way (fig. 9). In the panel of the devas watching the great feat is prominently represented Chandra, the Moon-god, with the crescent shown at the back, while the Sun-god is shown with a lotus in right hand and a full-blown lotus, symbolic of the Sun, at the back. Visņu being approached by the devas and Bali, representing the demons, for holding Mandara firm, shook off his yogic repose and held the summit of the Meru with his left hand and Bali held the thousand heads of Sesa also with his left and with his right he caught hold of his body. This Purānic description (1) of the details is faithfully sculptured in this figure assignable to the 9th- 10th cent. A.D. Visņu standing to the right of Mandara holds śańkha (conch-shell) in his outer right hand and chakra (discus) in his outer left. He touches Mandara with his inner left hand which along with the inner right has the tail of the Serpent, while leading the devas. The asuras are represented by Bali who is shown to the left of Mandara as clasping the head of Sesa by his hands one of which is mutilated. Indra on Airāvata, the divine elephant, is shown near the top of Mandara and close to the panel of devas , where one figure has a jar held in a hand and half-figure of a cow beside this. It seems quite probable that the entire panel above is meant to figure the group of divinities and divine animals, such as the crescent of the moon, disc of the Sun, garland (sumarias)^ g ha la (jar of nidhi or jewels jar excellent), Kãmadhenu (the divine cow) and Airāvata (the divine elephant) which Indra took, while Laksmī with nectar- jar is shown below at the front. As in the Khajurãho sculpture, here too, the Dik-Kuñjaras or Elephants of the Quarters are shown supporting the Cosmic Tortoise. In later day paintings this theme did not escape the attention of artists and painters. In a painting illustrated here (fig. 10), of the late Rajput school, now preserved in the Musée Guimet, we have this theme very well represented. Here three fierce figures, two of them horned, represent the asuras , while three of the devas holding Sesa at the other end represent Siva, Indra (?) and Brahmã with four faces. It is really unusual to (1) Matsya Punitici, CCXIyIX, vv. 13 /7.</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 9. - Bodoh.
