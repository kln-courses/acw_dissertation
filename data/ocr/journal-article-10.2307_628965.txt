<plain_text><page sequence="1">Senofane, Testimonianze e frammenti, a cura di M. UNTERSTEINER. Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1956. Pp. cclxxx+ 155. L. 4,000. Although this book is in general well produced and printed, neither editor nor publishers can be accused of pampering the reader. The fragments and testimonia are printed substantially as in Diels-Kranz (whose numbering and pagination are included) and both are accompanied by an Italian translation opposite, as well as by copious footnotes, occupying, frequently, the better part of both pages. There is however no apparatus criticus and the occasional departures from D-K's text are not clearly indicated, e.g. on p. 44 Apelt's reading of MXG 978b, 14 is adopted, but the fact is only to be discovered by reference to a series of footnotes in another part of the book. A large proportion of the footnotes, concerned with Xenophanes' philosophy, consists of these cross- references to the Introduction, and these are given not by the page but by chapter and footnote; the chapters being numbered only at the head. If the book had to be constructed in this clumsy way, it would have been kind to print it in two volumes. The notes, which include discussion of textual points, are full and comprehensive, and contain much that is of value, though they are somewhat clotted with superfluous bibliography. Those on the VOL. LXXVIII G</page><page sequence="2">162 NOTICES OF BOOKS doxographic material are welcome, and useful to have beside the text. In some of the others the relevance to Xenophanes is slight, as on A.27, where half a page is devoted to the ndaO KaT'ge68tav of the hexameter in which Xenophanes (as the relevant testimonium tells us) did not indulge. The substance of U.'s views is to be found in the eight introductory chapters of which the first (occupying ioo pages) deals with the difficult problem of MXG, and the remainder with Xenophanes as a religious thinker and philosopher, and with his life and works. All contain much quotation and dis- cussion of work on the subject since Zeller. On his life and works, nothing very new. U. argues in favour of the title 'nept qinajuo'; against the influence of Parmenides, any close connexion with the Eleatic school, and the doctrine of spherical Being, and finds in Xenophanes an opponent of anthropomorphism rather than of polytheism. For U. Xenophanes is significant chiefly as an early agent in the transfor- mation of mythical into scientific and abstract forms of thought. As a groping initiator of this process he reverts from Homeric anthropomorphism (see esp. pp. cxx ff. on BII and 12) to the 'pre-Hellenic' conception of the Earth Mother (identified, ap- parently, with the Winged Oak) which emerges in a new and more abstract form as the 'One God' of B23-26 (compatible, to his still mythical way of thinking, with a plurality of 'Sonderg6tter'), and as Earth in his physics. God is not for him a spiritual, much less a providential, Being, but mana, 'fluido divino', both one and many, in a process of transition to the 'rational' concept of Nous. In rejecting anachronistic sophistication from this theology, U. deserves approbation even from those who remain sceptical of the schematism of Mythos and Logos. But the relation to a pre-Hellenic Earth deity, though there may be some element of truth here, is supported by some dubious arguments. Kpa&amp;aiveL in B25 is found to contain a reference (in- stinctively divined by Xenophanes) to Kpa6t'l, the sacral branch ('impregnato di fluido energetico') of the Cosmic Oak. On p. cxli much is made of the word '"ppt &amp;aOat' in Aristotle de Caelo 294a, 22, which even if it is in Aristotle, is still not known to be in Xenophanes: and on p. cxxxix he finds in de Anima 405b, 8-Io very questionable support for the 'funda- mental proposition' of Xenophanes, 'ya a dai nadvra'. Elsewhere the concatenation of polysyllabic categories (pampsychism, hylozoism, pan-rationalism, etc.) does not succeed in supplying the lack of concrete evidence: the individual eludes the net of abstractions. The most remarkable part of the book is the first chapter. Recognising the difficulty of accepting the rest of MXG as substantially reliable while dismissing cc. 3-4 as worthless, and unwilling to follow Rein- hardt, U. propounds the hypothesis of a post- Theophrastean author of the Megarian school who, regarding Xenophanes as the founder of the Eleatic (and ancestor of the Megarian) school, corrected and restated his doctrine in terms of his own scholastic logic: thus the framework of c. 3 is Xenophanean but the development Megaric. This is one way of accounting for the singular features of this chapter (including the Theophrastean elements) and in working it out U. displays doggedness and ingenuity. But the attempt to discover and isolate in it most of the Megarian doctrines known to us, e.g. the identi- fication of iv and dyaOdv, or of 6VvautS and 8v8'pyeta (!), and even of their favourite (but surely not peculiar) forms of argument, induces, at a first and second reading, admiration and perplexity rather than conviction. Serious students of MXG will no doubt, however, wish to study it more minutely than has been possible to the reviewer. Despite its faults of excessive ingenuity and over- interpretation, this is the work of a scholar of great erudition, subtlety, and enthusiasm, and those who cannot accept its conclusions may still find in it a useful critical account of recent scholarship. There are no indices. The bibliography, which disclaims exhaustiveness, covers ten pages. It mentions Leisegang's RE article on Logos, but not that on Physis, nor Cook Wilson's notes on the text of MXG in CR vi and vii. More surprising, in view of the author's approach, is the omission of Onians' Origins of European Thought: and not less so, the inclusion of the Oxford Classical Dictionary. R.
