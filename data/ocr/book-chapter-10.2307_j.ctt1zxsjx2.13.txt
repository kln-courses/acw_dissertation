<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Rousseau’s God and Tolstoy’s God The above title may strike readers as scandalously heretical: most of  us, as heirs of the Judeo-Christian tradition, know that God is one.1 My  intent, however, is not to propagate a ditheistic or Manichaean heresy,  but merely to symbolize a move from the (quasi-)objective realm of  theology to the subjective one of psychology. My premise is simply this:  all of us, Rousseau and Tolstoy included, use whatever God or gods we  may have to serve our own intellectual and emotional needs. My aim is  therefore to seek whatever illumination may emerge from a comparison  of the ways each of these two great thinkers used his own private, inter- nal God. The comparison is not purely arbitrary; there is a strong genetic  connection between the two. The importance of Rousseau as a formative  infl uence on Tolstoy’s ideas on many subjects, among them religion, has  been clearly attested by Tolstoy himself: Rousseau has been my master since the age of fi fteen [he wrote  in 1905]. Rousseau and the Gospel have been the two great and  benefi cent infl uences of my life. Rousseau does not age. Quite recently  I happened to reread several of his works, and I experienced the same  1 An early version of this essay was presented at the AAASS convention in November,  1995, where excellent papers were presented by Liza Knapp, the organizer of the  symposium, and by Donna Orwin. There was also an illuminating commentary by Robin  Feuer Miller. </page> <page sequence="2"> 144 TOLSTOY THE THINKER feeling of spiritual uplift and of admiration that I experienced reading  him in my fi rst youth.2 Earlier he told Paul Boyer: I read all of Rousseau, all twenty volumes, including the Dictionary of  Music. I did more than venerate him; I formed a real Rousseau cult.  I wore his portrait around my neck like a holy image.3 Such veneration is all the more surprising in that by temperament Tolstoy  was anything but a hero-worshipper. He tended to regard all canonical  lofty reputations with fi erce skepticism and during his life shot down and  contemptuously cast into his commodious cultural rubbish heap such see- mingly sacrosanct master spirits of Western civilization as Shakespeare,  Dante, Goethe, Bach, Beethoven, and Raphael.4 But Rousseau was the  exception. Rousseau was even used as a personal measuring-rod. “I am  reading Rousseau,” Tolstoy wrote in 1852, “and I feel how much higher  he stands than I do in education and talent, but lower in self-respect,  fi rmness, and rationality” (diary 15 July 1852; SS 19:98–99).  To compare in full detail the religious views of Rousseau and Tolstoy,  would be a vast topic, far beyond the scope of this essay.5 I will therefore  2 Tolstoy to Bernard Bouvier, president of the Societé Jean-Jacques Rousseau of Geneva,  20 March 1905 (PSS 75:234). Original in French, my translation. The letter was written  in reply to an invitation to join the recently formed Rousseau Society. Tolstoy’s favorable  response to this invitation is most unusual: in general, he replied to all requests to lend  his name to honorary societies, academies, public bodies of any kind with scornful  silence. 3 Boyer, 40. In his biography of Tolstoy (p. 36) A. N. Wilson casts doubt on this statement,  arguing that neither the locket nor anyone else’s memory of it survived to corroborate  Tolstoy’s claim. Neither of these considerations seems to me weighty enough to impugn  Tolstoy’s unequivocal testimony. Moreover, Wilson’s reference to several conversations,  in one of which Tolstoy states only that he “wished he could have worn his [Rousseau’s]  portrait” seems to have no documentary basis at all. 4 In What Is Art? (1898) all of these eminences, along with all the great Greek dramatists,  Tasso, Milton, and Michelangelo (“with his absurd Last Judgment”) are cited as examples  of art falsely and harmfully canonized by generations of elitist critics who copy one ano- ther’s misassessments out of incompetence or cowardice (PSS 15:80). Shake speare,  of course, later got a special Tolstoyan roasting in “О Шекспире и о драме” (1906).  Beethoven’s early work is to some extent spared Tolstoy’s blanket censure, but the music  of his last period, when he had become deaf, was harmful, and it led directly to that very  epitome of everything musically pernicious, Richard Wagner. See the illuminating study  by Rischin. 5 The subject is quite well covered in the thorough, if somewhat dated book by Markovitch.  A more literary, less ideological approach to the comparison is taken by Vladimir Zbožilek.  I have also learned much from two books, one on each of my two protagonists: Weisbein  </page> <page sequence="3"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 145 begin by simply highlighting a few crucial similarities and differences in the  two men’s religious ideas. My ultimate aim, however, is to try to elucidate  the emotional relationship of each to the being they called God: what did  God mean to each of them, why did they need Him, and to what uses did  they put Him? The religious evolution of both Rousseau and Tolstoy was marked  by years of restless searching, with many twists, turns, and reversals  of direction. Born in Geneva, Rousseau was brought up as a Calvinist  Protestant. Formally converted to Roman Catholicism at age sixteen,  largely for opportunistic reasons, he remained at least nominally a Catholic  during his years of self-education under the cozy wing of his seductive  sponsor, Mme. de Warens, his adored “Maman.” But after his move to  Paris and association with the philosophes, Rousseau’s connection not  only with the Church, but even with Christianity itself, at least as most  believers would defi ne it, was essentially sloughed off. To be sure, in one  of his periods of confl ict with the French establishment he did for a time  proudly reclaim his Protestant Swiss birthright; but before long he found  the Protestant clergy as dogmatic and intolerant as their Catholic confrères  and renounced them in turn.6  Rousseau never embraced the complete atheism of his sometime  friends Diderot, Helvétius, Holbach, and La Mettrie, nor did he share  Voltaire’s bitter animus against the Church as an institution. He also  retained a deep admiration for the human personality of Jesus, who, he  felt, had propagated lofty ideals in a debased milieu and had borne with  dignity the sufferings of an ignominious death. But despite his differences  with the philosophes, Rousseau remained very much a product of the  rationalist Enlightenment. He emphatically repudiated all the central tenets  of offi cial — ecclesiastical — Christianity: Rousseau’s Jesus was not an  incarnate deity; he did not perform miracles; he did not rise from the dead;  and his death was not a payment needed to redeem mankind from original  sin.7 In all these views Tolstoy was very much in accord with his Franco- Swiss mentor, except that the late Tolstoy placed much more emphasis  and Jacquet. On Rousseau, Grimsley is also to be recommended. Especially illuminating  on Rousseau’s relation to the intellectual history of the eighteenth century and on the  later impact of his ideas is the fi ne essay by Melzer, “The Origin,” recommended to me by  Donna Orwin. 6 In Lettres écrites de la Montagne (1763) he accused the Calvinists of having betrayed the  chief principle of the Reformation, which he identifi es, quite ahistorically, as the right of all  Christians to interpret Scripture in the light of their own reason. 7 My summary of Rousseau’s religious views is derived primarily from the Profession du  foi du Vicaire Savoyard from Émile, supplemented by other texts collected or extracted  in Religious Writings. </page> <page sequence="4"> 146 TOLSTOY THE THINKER than Rousseau did on the moral teachings of Jesus as set forth in the  Sermon on the Mount.8  Rousseau retained a fi rm faith in the existence of God and in the  immortality of the human soul — two basic tenets also fairly consistently  shared by Tolstoy throughout his life, though Tolstoy suffered more  agonizing doubts on both counts than Rousseau did, and Tolstoy’s view  of immortality, particularly in his later years, was of a more Buddhist-like,  impersonal blending of the individual soul with the ultimate One than  the complete survival of personality pictured by Rousseau.9 Rousseau  insisted that the existence of God is demonstrated by the universe He  created, for it is impossible to explain the orderliness of the natural world  without postulating an intelligent Being who formed it. Rousseau’s God is  good, and the universe He created is also good. The world is orderly and  beautiful; all sin and disorder are of human making. A good God must by defi nition be just; justice is one of the necessary  attributes of an inherently orderly world. A just God could not favor  certain peoples over others, hence Rousseau’s rejection of Judaism, nor  could He damn to perdition the millions of people in Africa, Asia, and the  Americas whose only crime was that they had never heard of Jesus and  His salvifi c sacrifi ce. The doctrine of original sin is likewise unjust: how  can we be blamed for being born? Furthermore, Rousseau’s conviction  of the fundamental equality and goodness of all people bore the corollary  belief that God has implanted in every human heart a basic understanding  of right and wrong, good and evil, an innate conscience that lies at the  foundation of the “natural” religion which could and should unite all men  if only they would stop bickering over insoluble mysteries of theology or  technicalities of ritual. This belief is very close to Tolstoy’s The Kingdom  of God is Within You: the moral principles preached by Jesus are already  latent in every human being; we need only listen to the voice of God  8 See “Tolstoy and Jesus” in this volume. In general, Tolstoy clung far more tenaciously  than Rousseau did to the label “Christian.” As Arthur Melzer argues, Rousseau essentially  sought to replace institutional Christianity, a source of intolerance, strife, and war, with  a “natural” religion based on each individual’s “inner sentiment” or “sincerity,” on “what,  at the bottom of our hearts, we really do believe (“The Origin . . . , 352). Melzer pursues  the question of “sincerity” further in another interesting essay, “Rousseau and the Modern  Cult of Sincerity.” Tolstoy, on the other hand, insisting that his Christianity was the true  Christianity of Jesus, wanted to force all ecclesiastical Christians to recognize that their  churches had falsifi ed their Founder’s central teachings. 9 ”Желать при смерти одержать свою личность, это значит желать лишения себя  возможности новой, молодой жизни” (To wish to preserve one’s personality after death  means to wish to deprive oneself of the possibility of a new, young life), Tolstoy wrote in  his diary on 20 September 1902 (PSS 54:136). It is not clear, however, in what sense the  “young life” would be one’s own if one had lost all personal identity.  </page> <page sequence="5"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 147 within us. God does not care, Rousseau asserted, about what words are  said by a priest before an altar, nor how many genufl ections he makes.  God cares only about what lies in our hearts.10 These views were fully  shared by Tolstoy, who in his later years was even more vehement in his  fulminations against the sorcery and ritualism of the priests, culminating in  the famous “defamiliarized” satirical representation of the Orthodox liturgy  in Resurrection. Unlike the late Tolstoy, Rousseau acknowledged a certain place  for formal religion as an element of cultural unity in a particular country;  he did not object to the notion that all a king’s subjects should at least  formally share his faith. Thus even late in his life Rousseau was willing  to attend mass, just as his very unorthodox Vicaire Savoyard was willing  to celebrate it, simply to mark his membership in French society. But of  course Rousseau did not believe a word of what was said during that mass,  including its central mystery, the transubstantiation of bread and wine  into the body and blood of Christ.11 Thus Rousseau in his mature period  had only very loose and formal ties with Christianity. Though still living  in a nominally Christian society and conforming to some of its traditional  customs, he had essentially moved past Christianity to advocacy of a  “natural” universal faith. We can draw the obvious parallels with Tolstoy’s religious biography,  so vividly set forth for us in his Исповедь (A Confession, a title obviously  inspired by Rousseau’s Confessions).12 Brought up as a child within the  Orthodox Church, Tolstoy performed whatever religious observances were  expected of him, but without deep involvement or conviction. By the age of  fi fteen, perhaps already under Rousseau’s infl uence, Tolstoy had ceased  to observe the fasts or go to church. In the Confession he claims that  10 “The worship which God requires is that of the heart; and this, when it is sincere, is always  the same. One must be vain to the point of madness to imagine that God takes such  great interest in the form of a priest’s garments, the order of the words he pronounces,  the gestures he makes at the altar, and all his genufl ections,” says the Vicaire Savoyard  (Religious Writings 169, my translation). 11 “According to my new Principles,” says the Vicaire, “I celebrate it [the mass] with  more veneration,” to which Voltaire, in his marginal comments, remarked sarcastically,  “Ridicule, car tu ne crois pas à ta messe” (Ridiculous, for you don’t believe in your mass).  “With the thought that I am bringing to Him [God] the vows of the people in a prescribed  form, I follow all the rituals with care; I recite scrupulously, I take care never to omit even  the least word or the least ceremony,” the Vicaire goes on, again provoking an angry  comment from Voltaire: “Et pourquoi? Miserable!” (And why? Wretched one!) [Religious  Writings, 191]. Voltaire’s comments are cited in the footnotes.  12 It appears that this title was not originally assigned by Tolstoy himself, but the evidence  is clear that he later accepted and used it. See Gusev, Материалы с 1881 по 1885 год,  157–58.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 148 TOLSTOY THE THINKER all his middle years, up to the crisis of the late 1870s, were spent in this  state of religious indifference, though his diaries do not entirely confi rm  this assertion. Like Rousseau, he retained a belief in the existence of God,  though he was assailed by periods of doubt. For instance, his diary entry  for 7/19 March 1857 laments, “Last night I was tormented by the sudden  appearance of doubts about everything” (PSS 47:118). Earlier, in 1853, he  had given the doubts logical underpinning: I cannot prove to myself the existence of God, I fi nd no effective proof  of it, and I fi nd the concept unnecessary. It is easier and simpler to  conceive of a world that has existed eternally with its unutterably  splendid orderliness than of a Being who created it (diary 8 July 1853;  PSS 46:167). Just before writing this apparent apologia of atheism, incidentally, Tolstoy  had again been reading the Profession du foi du Vicaire Savoyard. “As  always after such reading,” he adds modestly, “I conceived a mass of  effective and noble thoughts. Yes, my largest misfortune is my big intellect  (большой ум)” (diary 8 July 1853; PSS 46:167).13 In 1857, sojourning  in Rousseau’s Switzerland, Tolstoy is affected, as he often was, by the  beauty of the night. A marvel of a night . . . And not to believe in the immortality of the soul,  when you feel in your soul such immeasurable greatness. I looked out  the window. It was black, broken and light. What’s the use of living? My  God! My God! What am I? Where am I? And where am I going? (diary  7 July 1857; PSS 47:141). But by 1860 Tolstoy had reasoned his way to belief in a rather impersonal,  deistic God: To whom can one pray? What sort of God is it that one can represent  to oneself clearly enough to supplicate Him, communicate with Him?  If I do represent such a God to myself, he loses all greatness for  me. A God who can be supplicated and served is an expression of  weakness of mind. What makes Him God is that I cannot conceive of  His whole being. And He is not a Being, He is law and power (diary  1 February 1860; PSS. 48:23). 13 Donna Orwin, in a searching exposition of the impact on Tolstoy of the Savoyard Vicaire’s  Profession du foi, convincingly interprets this passage as an expression of doubt on  Tolstoy’s part in the capacity of human reason to penetrate the ultimate realities [Orwin,  Tolstoy’s Art and Thought, 41]. Such doubts were intermittent, manifestations of the  lifelong warfare within Tolstoy of his “big intellect” and his yearning for faith.  </page> <page sequence="7"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 149 Although, as we shall see, in his prayers Tolstoy addresses God as  “Father” and seems to assume a personal relationship, in his moments  of more severe rationalism he suspects himself — and others — of anthro- pomorphic projection. The only God we can be sure of is the law and  will (закон, воля) to which we are called upon to submit (diary 30 March  1902; PSS 54:128). Only after his crisis of the late 1870s did Tolstoy turn decisively back  to Christianity. He fi rst attempted to reembrace the Orthodox Church, but  now on typically Tolstoyan “repentant nobleman,” peasantophile grounds.  The peasants must know best since they are peasants, and the peasants  are Orthodox believers. (The plebeian Rousseau, incidentally, felt no such  reverence for the superstitions of the bas peuple.) But when he actually  examined systematically the theology of the Orthodox Church as taught  to its clergy, Tolstoy’s rationalist mind, perhaps shaped partly by his  readings of Rousseau, revolted. Everything the Orthodox were supposed  to believe was absurd, beginning with the Trinity: how could anything be  one and three at the same time? He inveighs against this absurdity again  and again.14  Yet as we have seen, Tolstoy still ranked the Gospels alongside  Rousseau as his deepest spiritual infl uences. But the Gospels whose  wisdom Tolstoy cherished were not the Gospels of the miracle cures, the  marriage at Cana or the resurrection of Lazarus — violations of the natu- ral order that Rousseau also found unacceptable, despite his admiration  for the Gospels as a whole. Indeed, the resurrection miracles offended  Tolstoy’s very Rousseauistic sense of justice: why resurrect just Lazarus  and not John or Joan? It was the Sermon on the Mount, with its crucial  passage, I say unto you, that ye resist not evil (Matt 5:39), that Tolstoy  14 Here, for instance, is a characteristic diary entry for 1 January 1900, lumping together  the divinity of Jesus and the Trinity as irrational absurdities wrongfully instilled in child- ren: “Если ребенку раз внушено, что он должен верить, что Бог — человек, что Б[ог]  1 и 3, одним словом, что 2 × 2 = 5, орудие его познания навеки исковеркано: по- дорвано доверие к разуму. А это самое делается над всеми детьми. Ужасно.” (If it is  once instilled in a child that he must believe that God is a man, that God is one and three,  in a word, that 2 × 2 = 5, his instrument of cognition is forever spoiled; his confi dence in  reason is undermined. And this is done to all children. Terrible.) Similarly: “The person  who believes in Christ the God, in the resurrection, the holy mysteries, etc., ceases to  believe in reason. It is a direct statement: I do not believe in reason” (diary 9 November  1895; PSS 53:70). Texts like these seem to me to demonstrate that the infl uence on  Tolstoy of Western rationalists like Rousseau was much more powerful than the latent  effects on him, acquired simply by living in a Russian Orthodox culture, of “Eastern  Christianity.” The latter position is ably and exhaustively expounded in Richard F. Gus- tafson’s splendid work, Leo Tolstoy: Resident and Stranger: A Study in Fiction and  Theology. I argued my objection more fully in my review article, “Tolstoy Made Whole.” </page> <page sequence="8"> 150 TOLSTOY THE THINKER placed as the very keystone of his teaching. This was the deepest and  most fundamental message Tolstoy wanted to preach to the world; and  he insisted that it was, or should be, the essence of Christianity, since  these were words uttered by Christ Himself in His most fully articulated  statement of His teachings. Thus Tolstoy’s aim in the latter part of his life was quite different from  any pursued by Rousseau. Tolstoy’s purpose was to renovate Christianity,  to purge it, to restore a pure “Jesus” Christianity, freed from all the lies  and priestly encrustations of the ages, beginning with those imposed by  that great traducer and distorter of the message of Jesus, St. Paul. Only  very late in his life, after much reading in the scriptures of other faiths,  did Tolstoy come around to a universalist position more like Rousseau’s.  He then found affi nities between his Christian views and moral truths  propagated by most of the great religions, especially Buddhism, Taoism,  and Confucianism, and he hoped for a universal brotherhood that would  transcend all religious labels.15 After this brief summary I turn to a more speculative attempt to assess the  emotional underpinnings of these beliefs in both men. One is struck at once by certain marked similarities in their life  experiences. Each lost his mother at a very early age, too early to have  any memory of her. Both fathers were a poor substitute for the lost  mothers; in both cases relations between father and son were on the  whole friendly and benign, but far from close. Tolstoy, whose father also  died when he was only nine, was much better compensated for the loss  of his parents than Rousseau — by his siblings, extended family, various  aunts and mother-surrogates, and by his gentry status and inherited  wealth. Rousseau’s sense of isolation and abandonment remained acute,  in his late years degenerating into real clinical paranoia. Of course,  Rousseau did at times experience real persecution, but the atmosphere  evoked in the late Rêveries du promeneur solitaire is a nightmarish one  of a person beset from all sides by fi endish plots and diabolical intrigues.  As Byron put it, His life was one long war with self-sought foes  Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind  Had grown Suspicion’s sanctuary . . .     (Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, III, 18 [1816]) 15 See Pavel Biriukov, Tolstoi und der Orient. The subject of Tolstoy’s connection with the  Orient is also surveyed in Shifman, but unfortunately from a stridently “Leninist” point of  view. </page> <page sequence="9"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 151 The God who serves Rousseau’s emotional needs is more than the abstract  principle of will, order, and virtue postulated in his philosophical works as  permeating the universe. In his anguished isolation Rousseau longs for  a more personal God, a paternal God of justice who will recognize his  goodness and vindicate him. It is to this God he appeals in the famous  opening paragraph of the Confessions: . . . I shall . . . with this work in my hand . . . present myself before my  Sovereign Judge . . . I have displayed myself as I was, as vile and  despicable when my behavior was such, as good, generous, and  noble when I was so. I have bared my secret soul as Thou hast seen  it, Eternal Being! So let the numberless legion of my fellow men gather  around me, and hear my confessions . . . Then let each of them in turn  reveal, with the same frankness, the secrets of his heart at the foot of  Thy throne and say if he dare, “I was better than that man.”16 Rousseau puts his challenge in italics: Je fus meilleur que cet homme-là.  Obviously, no one will dare. What seems to me remarkable here is Rousseau’s complete sure- ness: a sublime self-confi dence that actually marked his entire life, making  it possible for him to take on the world, as it were, with the full certainty  that he was right and the world wrong. His fundamental, life-long existential  stance was to place himself, his feelings, his heart as the most authentic  reality, the ultimate source of truth and value. Thus standing before God at  the Last Judgment, he is completely sure that he is not only no worse than  any other person, but in fact better, since he has been more honest than  they. He has confessed his sins, at least some of them.17 However, I sense  very little real contrition in Rousseau’s Confessions. The confessed sins  were errors of immaturity and growth, and he has corrected them by his  16 The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 17. I have made some changes in the  translation. 17 Rousseau’s most famous confessed sin was the theft of a ribbon in the household where  he worked as a lackey. When the theft was discovered, he publicly blamed a young  maidservant, who was then dismissed. Rousseau says that he was haunted all his life  by this “cruel memory” (Confessions, Book II). For most readers, however, among them  Voltaire, a far worse crime was the abandonment of the fi ve children he had with his  mistress Thérèse Levasseur, an act he blandly justifi es by the thought that they were better  off being brought up by the State to be workers and peasants “instead of adventurers and  fortune-hunters.” In fact, however, most of the babies left in the home for Enfants-Trouvés  died in their fi rst year, a fact Rousseau did not allow himself to face. He also seems to  have given little or no consideration to Thérèse’s feelings about the matter. The relevant  passages are in the Confessions, Book VIII. Rousseau’s fullest effort to justify his act is  in his letter to Mme de Francueil of 20 April 1751, cited in the notes to Les confessions  (Oeuvres complètes, I, 1431).  </page> <page sequence="10"> 152 TOLSTOY THE THINKER own efforts. He now stands before God proud of himself and his suc cess.  Perhaps surprisingly, Rousseau does not extend his scene of ulti mate  vindication to include a satisfying punishment imposed by God on his  enemies. Apparently, his belief in the Lord’s goodness and mercy was too  strong to permit this bit of imaginative self-indulgence. He always insisted  that a God ‘’who condemns to eternal torments the majority of His creatures  is not the good and peaceful God my reason has demonstrated to me.”18  I discern much the same pattern in Tolstoy’s Исповедь. Indeed, the simi- larity is more than literary, but stems from a profound similarity of these  two men in personality, in basic attitude toward themselves and the world.  Like Rousseau, Tolstoy was sublimely self-confi dent, insistent on thinking  things through for himself, suspicious of all authorities and received  opinions, willing to take on the whole world and set it right. Tolstoy’s  Confession also seems to me to lack any real contrition. He says he has  committed all possible crimes, from adultery to murder, but he gives very  little detail about them: I killed men in war, I challenged them to duels in order to kill them. I lost  at cards and consumed the labor of peasants. I punished them, forni- cated, deceived. Falsehood, robbery, adultery of all types, drunkenness,  violence, murder. There was no crime I did not commit, and for all this  I was praised. My coevals considered and consider me a comparatively  moral person. (SS 16:98) Even here the thrust of his discourse is to place the blame not on himself,  but on the milieu, on the ubiquitous “they” (that wonderful, self-exonerating  Russian third person plural verb without any subject!) who implanted  false values in him and actively discouraged his striving for truth and  goodness. Tolstoy, however, had none of Rousseau’s paranoia. He does  not look forward to a scene of triumphant vindication after death, and he  issues no such bitter challenge to his fellow men as Rousseau’s defi ant  dare to anyone who might venture to claim moral superiority over him.  Indeed, Tolstoy does not seem much interested in any version of the Last  Judgment, as some sort of reckoning performed by God with assignment  of rewards and punishments. The idea of metempsychosis, so charmingly articulated by Natasha  Rostova in War and Peace, had been with Tolstoy for a long time. The  idea of a “one-directional immortality” (from death onwards), as embraced  by offi cial Christianity and even by Rousseau’s Vicaire Savoyard, seemed  18 From Émile, cited from Markovitch, 120. </page> <page sequence="11"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 153 to him absurd: if our souls live eternally after death, they must have lived  eternally before birth as well. As early as 1852, rereading the Vicaire’s  Profession du foi, Tolstoy found it  full of contradictions, unclear and abstract passages along with ones  of extraordinary beauty. All I got out of it was a conviction of the non- immortality of the soul. If the concept of immortality requires that we  remember a previous life, then we are not immortal. But my mind  refuses to comprehend immortality from one end (diary 29 June 1852;  PSS 46:128). In a diary entry of 24 January 1894 Tolstoy offers a diagram of the process  of “double-ended immortality”: The straight line is God [he explains]. The narrow places are the  approach to death and birth. In those places God is closer. He is not  hidden by anything. But in the middle of life he is obscured by the  complexity of life. Lord, take me, teach me, enter into me. Be me. Or  destroy me: without Thee it is not that I do not want to live, I cannot  live. Father! (PSS 52:110) Later Tolstoy overcomes the problem of our failure to remember our  previous existence by postulating that the kind of consciousness we  enjoy here on earth is specifi c to our animal nature here. Our life after  death (and also, presumably, before birth) will lack (or lacked) personality,  individuality. We were and will be fused with the deity in a state to which  the earthly concepts of space and time are inapplicable: The essence of Christ’s teaching [he wrote in 1895] is that man . . .  should understand that he, he himself, was never born and never died  but always is and in this world passes through only one of the countless  forms of life to fulfi ll the will of the One who sent him into this life (diary  7 December 1895; PSS 53:75). Though prayer plays an important part in the relations with God of  both our confessors, their prayers are never truly penitential, pleas for  forgiveness. Clearly, they have already forgiven themselves, and God  is given little choice in the matter. Their prayers serve other functions.  Both also consistently reject the most common human prayer, the plea for  </page> <page sequence="12"> 154 TOLSTOY THE THINKER some special benefi t or concession. An omniscient and benevolent God,  they insist, already knows what we require and will provide for us; He  has no need of our instructions. It is presumptuous and childish to plead  for favors, which if granted would disrupt the divine order. The Vicaire  Savoyard prays simply in order to adore the wise Author of the universe.  “I am moved by His benefactions and I bless Him for his gifts,” he says.19  And in the Confessions Rousseau recalls the delight of praying in the  midst of nature’s beauties, simply thanking God for the joy of being alive,  a sentient part of His superb creation: I got up every morning before sunrise and climbed through a near- by orchard . . . As I walked up there I said my prayers, which did not  consist of a vain motion of the lips but of a sincere raising of the  heart towards the Creator of that beauteous Nature whose charms  lay beneath my eyes. I have never liked to pray in a room; walls and  all the little works of man come between myself and God. I love to  contemplate Him in His works, while my heart uplifts to Him. I venture  to say that my prayers were pure, and for that reason deserved to be  heard. (The Confessions, 225) Rousseau does, however, allow himself after all to make some modest  requests, though none that demand any special intervention on God’s  part, let alone suspension of the laws of nature: For myself and for her whom I always remembered in them [i.e., Mme.  de Warens], I asked no more than an innocent and peaceful life, free  from all wickedness, grief, and distressing want, and that we should die  the death of the just, and share their fate in the hereafter. He does, to be sure, qualify the plea with the recognition that the best way  of obtaining these benefi ts is not to ask for them, but to deserve them (The  Confessions, 225). In Rousseau’s case almost our only data for speculating about his  religious feelings come from his published writings.20 With Tolstoy, on the  other hand, we have the diaries, for our purposes a precious source of  insight into their author’s feelings about God, especially since he often  19 Cited from Jacquet 154. “Je m’attendris à ses bienfaits, je le bénis de ses dons.” 20 An early prayer composed by Rousseau in the Chambéry period was found among his  papers and published (Oeuvres complètes, 4:1036–39). After the expected effusion of awe  and admiration before God’s infi nite power and benefactions, Rousseau does confess,  in very general terms, to a plethora of sins brought on by his “passions.” He promises to  amend his life. “In a word, O my sovereign Master, I will dedicate my life to serving Thee,  to obeying Thy laws, and to fulfi lling my duties.” Quoted form Religious Writings, 6.  </page> <page sequence="13"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 155 incorporates into it actual prayers. What were these feelings? One is  reminded of a famous image evoked in Gorky’s memoir on Tolstoy: “With  God he has ill-defi ned relations, but sometimes they remind me of the  relations of two bears in one den” (GSS 14:261). After the evidence of  Tolstoy’s diaries, early and late, however, I conclude that Gorky’s image is  misleading. The two bears metaphor, however picturesque, does not seem  to me at all to convey the nature of ToIstoy’s relationship with the deity.  Tolstoy was not a богоборец, a God-fi ghter, like several of Dostoevsky’s  characters. He does not argue with God or threaten Him, like Kirillov in  The Devils nor blame Him for the moral disorder in the universe, like Ivan  Karamazov. There was, to be sure, at least one moment in his life when Tolstoy  did shake his fi st at the heavens, a burst of cosmic rage after the death of  his beloved brother Nikolai in 1860. What’s the use of anything [he exclaimed in a letter to Fet] when  tomorrow the torments of death may begin . . . What a funny joke! Be  useful, be virtuous, be happy while you live, we and other people have  been saying to one another for centuries; and happiness and virtue  and usefulness lie in truth, and the truth which I have extracted from  my 32 years is that the situation in which someone has placed us is the  most terrible deception and crime, one for which we (we liberals) would  not fi nd words if a human being had placed another in such a situation.  Praise Allah, God, Brahma! What a benefactor! (17/29 October 1860;  PSS 60:357–58) One would have thought that the death in 1895 from scarlet fever of his  seven-year-old son Vanichka might have provoked outrage in Tolstoy  similar to what he had felt at his brother’s passing thirty-fi ve years  earlier. Vanichka was the adored child of his and Sofya Andreevna’s old  age, evidently an exceptionally loving and promising boy. The loss was  devastating to both of them. But though he himself connected the two  events, the late Tolstoy cannot allow himself to blame God: We buried Vanichka. It was terrible — no, not terrible, but a great spiritual  event. I thank Thee, Father, I thank Thee . . . Vanichka’s death was for  me like Nikolenka’s, no, to a much greater degree a manifestation of  God, an approach to Him. And therefore I not only cannot say that it  was a sad, melancholy event, but I say straight out that it was (joyous)  [радостное] — not joyous, that is a bad word, but an act of God’s mercy,  which dispels the falseness of life, an event which draws one to Him.  (26 February and 12 March 1895; PSS 53:10) </page> <page sequence="14"> 156 TOLSTOY THE THINKER In general, Tolstoy’s most frequent attitude in prayer seems genuinely  humble. One might have thought that a man as proud and self-assured  as Tolstoy would be unable to assume an attitude of humility even before  God. Certainly his model Rousseau could hardly be described as humble:  Rousseau as it were smiles at God and expects God to smile back, a  mutual admiration society. But in the privacy of his diary Tolstoy repeatedly confesses to weak- ness, inadequacy. Feeling awkward and unattractive in the presence of  women of his own class, Tolstoy in his youth even violated the Rousseau- istic prohibition against asking God for favors. In one of his nocturnal mo- ments of intense awareness, he begs the Lord to make him better looking:  “I just looked at the sky. A glorious night. God have mercy on me. I am ugly.  Let me be good-looking and happy. God have mercy” (25 August 1855;  PSS 47:60). Later, after a repeated failure of nerve he begged God to help  him screw up his courage to propose to his future wife, Sofya Bers: “Lord,  help me, teach me,” he pleads twice, for reinforcement even turning to the  Mother of God, a personal, anthropomorphic deity he later emphatically  repudiated (10 September 1862; PSS 48:44). By far the most frequent  prayer ful note in the diary is: Help me, give me strength. “Do not abandon  me, Lord,” he writes in 1853. “Teach me. Give me strength, decisiveness,  and intelligence” (4 January 1853; PSS 46:156). It is a plea repeated again  and again over the years. “Father, help me,” he begs in 1888, troubled by  his failure to win over his wife and family by love (25 January 1889; PSS  50:29). “I am sad, sad,” he writes in 1892, appalled at the greed and strife  displayed by his children when he undertook to renounce all his property  rights. “Heavy-hearted. Father, help me. Have pity on me. I do not know  what I should do. Help me. Teach me to love” (5 July 1892; PSS 52:68).”Lord,  help me,” he writes in 1894, tormented by the ever-present contradiction he  felt he had to live with: while advocating for others voluntary simplifi cation  of life to its basest fundamentals, Tolstoy himself continues to lead the  comfortable life of a Russian gentleman, surrounded by a wife and family  who share few of his spiritual aspirations. He would like to right the moral  balance with some dramatic display of sacrifi ce, but voluntary self-abne- gation, self-repudiation in the name of family love, was much more diffi cult.  He had to endure the mockery of his critics and often the reproaches of his  followers. “Teach me how to bear this cross. I keep preparing myself for the  cross I know, for prison, the gallows, and this is quite different, a new one,  and I don’t know how to bear it” (24 January 1894; PSS 52:110). In his moments of need Tolstoy obviously perceived God as a loving  father who will hold out a hand, pull him out of his diffi culties, and instill  strength in him. But all too often his rationalist mind keeps undermining  </page> <page sequence="15"> ROUSSEAU’S GOD AND TOLSTOY’S GOD 157 his belief. He knows that God cannot be conceived as a personality: that  is the root of anthropomorphism. One of the chief causes of the evil of our life is the belief, taught in our  Christian world, in a crude, Jewish, personal God; whereas the chief  feature (if one can use this expression) of God is that He is in no way  limited and therefore is not personal. (18 December 1899; PSS 53:232) Maybe God as the addressee of prayer does not even exist. I love to address myself to God [he writes]. If there were no God, even  so it would be good to address an impersonal void. In such address  there is none of the weakness, vanity, desire to accommodate others  and calculation almost inescapable when one addresses people.  (25 November 1888; PSS 50:5) And elsewhere Tolstoy suggests that in praying to God one is in fact  simply addressing what is holy within oneself:  You pray to God. They say, to what God. How can you know that He  hears you? That God who is in me hears me, of that there can be no doubt. Then you are praying to yourself? Yes, only not to my lower self, not to my whole self, but to that part of  me that is divine, eternal, loving. And it hears me and answers. I thank Thee and love Thee, O Lord, who dwellest in me. (19 March  1900; PSS 53:15) Year after year the tragic struggle goes on. Both demands of the  public persona, as the prophet of a new religion, and the private yearning  to see himself as a loving, self-abnegating human being who will blissfully  blend in death with the principle of love that pervades the universe — this  need and this hope are continually undercut by assaults from his relentless  reasoning intellect. Always there lurked in the shadows the all-purpose nihilistic weapon  he had once aimed at a critical article by Aleksandr Druzhinin: ‘’It never  occurs to him to wonder whether it’s all nonsense” (не вздор ли это  все)21 (7 December 1856; PSS 47:104). If zapped by this fearful weapon,  perhaps the whole edifi ce of Tolstoyan Christianity might also be deemed  “all nonsense” — indeed, a shattering thought. 21 In teaching Tolstoy, I used to advise students to make for themselves and carry a pocket  copy of this marvelous weapon, не вздор ли это все — very useful when reading news- papers, listening to political speeches, or reading articles by learned professors. </page> <page sequence="16"> 158 TOLSTOY THE THINKER But back in his youth the tragic contradiction was still only latent, the  optimism he found in Rousseau was still accessible. Perhaps the most  purely Rousseauistic prayer recorded in Tolstoy’s diaries occurs very early,  on 12 June 1851, at age 23, in the Caucasus: Yesterday I almost didn’t sleep all night and after writing my diary began  to pray to God. The sweetness of the feeling I experienced in prayer  is inexpressible. I recited the prayers I ordinarily say, to the Father, the  Mother of God, the Trinity, the Gates of Mercy, to my guardian angel,  and then I went on praying. If prayer is defi ned as begging or gratitude,  then I did not pray. I wanted something lofty and good; but what, I cannot  express, although I clearly understood what it was. I wanted to merge  with an all-embracing Being. I asked It to forgive my transgressions, but  no, I did not ask that, for I felt that if It [Оно] had given me this blessed  moment, It had forgiven me. I asked and at the same time felt that  there was nothing for me to ask for, that I could not and did not know  how to ask. I gave thanks, yes, but not in words and not in thoughts.  In that one feeling I combined everything, both plea and gratitude  [crossed out: and submission to Its will]. Any feeling of fear completely  disappeared . . . No, the feeling I experienced yesterday was love of  God, a sublime love, combining in itself everything good and excluding  everything bad . . . I did not feel the fl esh, I was all spirit. To be sure, Tolstoy goes on to admit that the fl esh soon reasserted  itself. He went to sleep and dreamt about glory and women. But even to  that he adds a disclaimer of responsibility: Я не виноват, я не мог (I’m not  to blame, I couldn’t help it) (PSS 46:61–62). There is no evidence, alas, that such a sublime moment in Tolstoy’s  life was ever repeated. Far more typical, I fear, is the cry “Father, help  me!” — the cry of a man who, like Dostoevsky’s Shatov, is desperately  trying to defend his belief against the unremitting assaults of his “big  intellect.” </page> </plain_text>
