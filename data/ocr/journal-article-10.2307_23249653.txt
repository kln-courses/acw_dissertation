Emerson, Illinois State Archaeological Survey, University of Illinois, 209 Nuclear Physics Lab (MC-571), 23 East Stadium Drive, Champaign, Illinois 61820 Abstract The exchange of some Oneota red pipestone artifacts commonly, but sometimes incorrectly, identified as manufactured from catlinite from southwest Minnesota, likely created fictive kinship alliances between unrelated groups from ca. A.D. 1450 into the early 1700s. Research ers have determined, however, that red pipestone raw material occurs across a wide area within the United States and Canada. Determin ing the provenance of this red pipestone raw material is thus critical to understanding Oneota trade and alliance building. Using Portable Infrared Mineral Analyzer (PIMA) technology to identify the raw material sources of 84 red pipestone artifacts from seven Oneota vil lages in the Little Sioux valley of northwest Iowa, we demonstrate that while the local inhabitants had access to the catlinite quarries, they also used a wide range of pipestones from other sources. The possible implications of these multiple source areas are also discussed. ...their greatest wealth is in buffalo hides and red stone calumet pipes —Father Louis Andre, 1676 (Wedel 1986) The first known meeting between the French and the Ioway was recorded by Jesuit Father Louis Andre at a Winnebago village south of Green Bay in 1676.

Fishel et al. importance of two items to the Ioway, bison hides and red stone (generally assumed to be catlinite) calumet pipes. By the time Andre encountered the Ioway, they, and their probable Oneota ancestors, had been quarrying this red pipestone for more than 200 years. The abundance of red pipestone artifacts and scrap pieces found on some Iowa Oneota sites frequently as sociated with the Ioway, as well as the occurrence of finished items across the Prairie Peninsula, into the Plains, and even as far east as Pennsylvania and New York (Hamilton 1967; Hollinger et al. 2008), has led Henning to suggest "the Ioway were important middlemen in down-the-line trade dur ing the period 1650-1700. Very likely, their ancestors had functioned in this capacity for centuries" (Henning 2003:216). The Ioway were also just one of the many groups, including the Omaha, Ponca, Arikara, and Oto, who occupied or visited the Blood Run site in northwest Iowa/southeast South Dakota that probably functioned as a redistribution center for trade items, including red pipestone, throughout the Midwest (Alex 2000:204; Henning 2007:76-79). Thus, while the Ioway were not always the sole "middlemen" participating in the trade or exchange of red pipestone artifacts across the Midwest, they undoubtedly played an important role in this redistribution. While the best known of the red pipestones is catlinite from southwest Minnesota, Howell (1940), Sigstad (1973), and Gundersen (1993) were among the first to warn against assuming that all red pipestone can be classi fied as catlinite originating from the Pipestone, Minnesota locality. Gunder sen's research (1991) demonstrated that while many red argillites ("red pipestone") may appear similar macroscopically, their mineralogical com position varies based upon source area. For example, red pipestone cobbles occur within the glacial till south of Pipestone as far away as Kansas. These pipestone cobbles, when recovered from the drift deposits in South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas are known as "Kansas pipestone" (Gundersen 1988; Gundersen and O'Shea 1981; Scott et al. 2006). Scott et al. (2006:Table 3) further list areas in 11 U.S. states and also Ontario, Canada as source loca tions for red pipestone. To that list of locations we add northeast Millard County, Utah (colloquially known as "Utah pipestone") and the glacial till in Woodbury County, Iowa (discussed below). To the archaeologist, dif ferentiating between true catlinite and other red pipestone source materi als can provide insights into social and political relationships that shaped Oneota society (Henning 1998a) via such rituals as the calumet ceremony (Blakeslee 1981; Brown 1989). Previous researchers have had to rely primarily upon either subjective methods, such as color (e.g., Sigstad 1970), or destructive tests, such as X-ray powder diffraction (e.g., Boszhardt and Gundersen 2003; Farnsworth et al.</page><page sequence="3">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 169 2004; Gundersen 1987, 1991; Gundersen and Tiffany 1986; Penman and Gundersen 1999), to determine the raw material from which a pipestone artifact was manufactured. During the past decade, however, our team of ar chaeologists and geologists (Hughes, Wisseman, and Emerson) at the Uni versity of Illinois has used a Portable Infrared Mineral Analyzer (PIMA) in conjunction with X-ray diffraction and selected chemical techniques to de termine the types and origins of pipestones used to make prehistoric North American figurines and pipes (Emerson and Hughes 2000, 2001; Emerson et al. 2002, 2003, 2005; Hughes et al. 1998; Wisseman et al. 2002). The PIMA was first used by geologists in Australia to locate precious metals, assess ore quality, study the degree of crystallinity of minerals, and map zones of alteration in rocks changed by hydrothermal processes. This shoebox-size instrument can be operated in the field or in a museum setting. It is totally nondestructive; there is no induced radiation damage or sample modification. PIMA spectroscopy is an excellent precursor to standard labo ratory analysis by the complementary technique of X-ray diffraction or by more costly elemental techniques such as neutron activation analysis. The PIMA uses short wave infrared (SWIR), from 1300-2500 nano meters (nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared radiation causes vibration, including bending and stretching, of atomic bonds. Absorption features seen in PIMA graphs are manifestations of energy absorption within the crystal lattice from vibrational state transitions. These vibrational states correspond to distinct energy levels, so absorption features are narrow and occur at well-defined wavelengths (Horsefall 2001:6). The PIMA is especially sensitive to minerals that have hydroxyl, water, carbonate, or phosphate bonds. Such minerals dominate pipestone groups (Emerson et al. 2005:194). Examples are clays such as kaolinite and musco vite, carbonates such as calcite, and phosphates such as apatite. Archaeologi cally, this translates into stone and low-fired clay artifacts, some corrosion products, bone, and certain museum restoration materials such as plaster and shellac (Wisseman et al. 2004). PIMA analysis has successfully been applied to red pipestone speci mens from Cahokia (Emerson and Hughes 2000, 2001), the Hoxie Farm site (11CK4) southeast of Chicago (Brown and O'Brien 1990), and the Lima Lake locality of western Illinois (Nolan 2007). It has also been used to iden tify limited early Ohio Hopewell use of catlinite (Emerson et al. 2005). Nu merous artifacts macroscopically identified as catlinite from the Cahokia area were determined to actually be derived from Missouri flint clay (Em erson and Hughes 2001), while the Hoxie Farm artifacts, which consisted primarily of a few pipes and pipe fragments, were manufactured from true</page><page sequence="4">Richard L. Fishel et at. catlinite from southwest Minnesota (Madeleine Evans, personal communi cation to Fishel 2008). The Lima Lake artifacts were likewise derived largely from catlinite; one Lima Lake disc pipe was manufactured from the red pipe stone of northern Wisconsin (Nolan 2007). This article presents the results of PIMA analysis conducted on 84 red pipestone artifacts and four red pipestone cobbles collected from seven Oneota villages in the Little Sioux valley of northwest Iowa. This analysis was spurred on by the discovery of red pipestone pebbles and nodules in the glacial till beneath the Dixon Oneota village in Woodbury County, Iowa (see below). It was hoped that the mineralogical composition of these nod ules would significantly differ from the composition of other pipestones (including catlinite), allowing for a more-precise provenance determination of pipestone raw material sources for Oneota artifacts from the Little Sioux valley. Before detailing the results of this analysis, a brief introduction into the initial (pre A.D. 1400) utilization of red pipestone in the Iowa region is presented, followed by a summary description of the Iowa Oneota sites used in this analysis. Early Red Pipestone Utilization Red pipestone use within the Upper Midwest is frequently associated with the calumet ceremony (Blakeslee 1981; Brown 1989). This ceremony con tains "an adoption ritual... which establishes] a fictive kinship relationship between individuals of different clans, bands, or ethnic groups" (Blakeslee 1981:759), thus making "friends out of foes" (Brown 1989:313), and in some Native societies allows a person to be reborn or revitalized (Brown 2007:95-96). The calumet ceremony likely began on the Great Plains and spread east onto the Prairie Peninsula and the Eastern Woodlands (Blakeslee 1981). While the principle component of the calumet ceremony, the wood en pipe stem, does not usually survive archaeologically, the stone pipe bowl is often preserved. Calumet pipe bowls are usually manufactured from a red pipestone often assumed to be catlinite. However, Blakeslee (1981) and Brown (1989) both emphasize that the recovery of a red pipestone pipe bowl does not necessarily imply the occurrence of the calumet ceremony. Other than limited utilization during the Early and Middle Woodland periods in the Great Lakes region (Boszhardt and Gundersen 2003; Emer son et al. 2005; Hollinger et al. 2008), catlinite was not intensively quarried until the Oneota began manufacturing the raw material into tablets, pipes, and pendants nearly 1200 years later (e.g., Penman and Gundersen 1999). Red pipestone artifacts are present at many Mill Creek (ca. A.D. 1100-1250)</page><page sequence="5">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 171 sites in northwest Iowa (Baerreis 1968:187; Fugle 1962:67; Gundersen and Tiffany 1986; Henning 2003; King and Henning 1996). These pipestone ar tifacts are usually (but not always) small in size, leading some researchers to suggest the Mill Creek pipestone was likely collected from northwest Iowa glacial gravels as opposed to being quarried from southwest Minnesota. Only four Mill Creek red pipestone artifacts have thus far been sub jected to raw material analysis. One artifact from the Broken Kettle site (13PM1) has been identified by X-ray powder diffraction as catlinite (Scott et al. 2006:Table 4) and an effigy pendant from the Possum site (13PM420) has been identified by PIMA as manufactured from catlinite (Fishel and Tit comb 2009). Two other artifacts, a cloud blower-type pipe from the Double Ditch site (130B8) and an effigy pendant from the Rock Creek Ossuary (13PM65), both have been identified as Kansas pipestone by PIMA (Fishel and Titcomb 2009). These results suggest that the Mill Creek people were aware of, and utilized, the catlinite quarries in addition to collecting red pipestone raw materials from glacial gravels south of Pipestone, Minnesota. Even though the Mill Creek people have been described as the "preeminent traders" of the Northeastern Plains (Henning 2007:82), red pipestone was evidently not routinely included as a Mill Creek exchange item, at least not with most Middle Mississippian groups farther to the east, suggesting it had not yet achieved the power and significance the stone would later attain with the Oneota (e.g., Emerson and Hughes 2001). Red pipestone is scarce on Great Oasis sites (the precursor to Mill Creek in some geographical areas, ca. A.D. 950-1100 [Lensink and Tiffany 2005:127-129]). However, other trade items, such as minimal amounts of Gulf and Atlantic coast marine shell, are found on some northwest Iowa sites and at one central Iowa Great Oasis site (Henning 1991, 2007:69; Tiffany and Alex 2001). One small piece visually identified as catlinite, perhaps used as a pigment stone, was recovered from the Cowan (13WD88) Great Oasis site in Woodbury County, Iowa (Morrow and Mayer 2005:84). A red pipestone pipe fragment came from the Crocker site (13CK71) (Jason Titcomb, person al communication to Fishel 2008), and a worked red pipestone piece came from the Beals site (13CK62) (Jason Titcomb, personal communication to Fishel 2008). Both sites are in Cherokee County, Iowa. Five pieces of red pipe stone tentatively identified as catlinite were also recovered from the Great Oasis/Mill Creek Larson site (13PM61) in Plymouth County of northwest Iowa (King and Henning 1996:56-57). The predominance of red pipestone at Mill Creek sites compared to Great Oasis suggests that the Larson site red pipestone may be associated with the Mill Creek component rather than the Great Oasis occupation. Great Oasis ceramics have been found within Pipe</page><page sequence="6">172 Richard L. Fishel et at. stone National Monument (Scott et al. 2006), which is within the region of southwest Minnesota that Great Oasis was first defined as a discrete cultural entity (Wilford 1945). The presence of these sherds, however, does not con firm Great Oasis use of catlinite. Red pipestone pipes occur at some Nebraska phase sites (ca. A.D. 1150 1300) in the Glenwood locality of southwest Iowa and the adjacent state of Nebraska (Billeck 1993; Blakeslee 1981; Blakeslee and Caldwell 1979; Hill and Cooper 1937). This raw material may originate from glacial till deposits in Kansas and Nebraska, or perhaps even Iowa. Because interaction with some northern and western societies has been documented in Nebraska phase assemblages (Alex 2000:178; Ritterbush 2007), future PIMA analysis of these Nebraska phase red pipestone pipes would be helpful in verify ing possible external contacts with the Mill Creek, Oneota, or those Central Plains tradition groups living along and west of the Missouri River. Oneota initially appears as a recognizable cultural manifestation in the Upper Mississippi valley late in the second half of the twelfth century (Theler and Boszhardt 2006). The Oneota first settled in Iowa in the central Des Moines valley around A.D. 1260, later abandoning this area around A.D. 1300 (Fishel 2001) and relocating to southeastern Iowa (Henning 1998b:375). Moingona phase Oneota sites in the central Des Moines valley dating to this time show no evidence of red pipestone use. One of the earli est uses of red pipestone at Iowa Oneota sites may occur at the Wever village in southeast Iowa, which dates between A.D. 1300 and 1350. However, only two pieces, macroscopically identified as possible catlinite, were recovered from the plow zone of that extensively excavated site (Henning 1995:70). While the Dixon site in northwest Iowa was first occupied ca. A.D. 1300 and numerous types of red pipestone are present at the site (see below), Fishel (1999:61) suggested that intensive red pipestone utilization primar ily occurs after A.D. 1400 in the Dixon occupation. The use of "catlinite" by the Oneota was "extremely rare" in the LaCrosse region of western Wiscon sin, eastern Minnesota, and northeast Iowa prior to A.D. 1300 (Boszhardt 1998:212). Early red pipestone use, consisting of catlinite and Kansas pipe stone, has been documented at several Wisconsin Oneota sites that date in the A.D. 1300s (Penman and Gundersen 1999). In Minnesota, Penman and Gundersen (1999) used X-ray powder dif fraction to identify several Oneota red pipestone artifacts from the Red Wing area as siltstone as opposed to catlinite. These sites likely date between ca. A.D. 1150 and 1300 (Boszhardt 1998; Penman and Gundersen 1999). Gib bon (1983) also reports that three pieces of what are visually identified as catlinite were recovered from the Blue Earth phase Humphrey Village and</page><page sequence="7">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 173 Vosburg sites in south central Minnesota. A large amount of red pipestone exists within local collections from these sites (Dale Henning, personal com munication to Fishel 2008), the occupation of which has been estimated to occur between ca. A.D. 1350 and 1450 (Dobbs 1984). In Illinois, red pipestone artifacts are not associated with the Bold Counselor Oneota of the central Illinois valley (Lawrence Conrad, personal communication to Fishel 2007), which dates primarily to the fourteenth century (Esarey and Conrad 1998; Esarey and Santure 1990:164-165). They do occur in very limited numbers at the fourteenth century Hoxie Farm site near Chicago (Douglas Jackson, personal communication to Fishel 2008). Red pipestone artifacts, some of which have been identified by PIMA analy sis as catlinite (Nolan 2007), are also present at Oneota sites in the Lima Lake locality ofwestern Illinois (Nolan and Conrad 1998). While the date of the initial appearance of the Oneota in the Lima Lake locality is unknown, it may have begun in the A.D. 1300s and Oneota occupation probably lasted into the A.D. 1500s (Nolan 2007; Nolan and Conrad 1998:141). Red pipe stone artifacts are not associated with the Oneota Groves phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1400) of the American Bottom (Jackson 1998:108), but several red pipestone artifacts have been recovered in surface collections from some American Bottom generic "Oneota" components (Emerson and Hughes 2001). A limited number of red pipestone artifacts are associated with the few known Oneota sites in the lower Illinois valley (Farnsworth and O'Gorman 1998). The time frame of these lower Illinois valley sites, as well as the context of some of the pipestone artifacts, is ambiguous. The White Rock Oneota phase of north-central Kansas/south-central Nebraska (Logan 1994) contains a limited number of red pipestone pipes (Blakeslee et al. 2001; Logan 1998), one of which has been identified through X-ray diffraction as catlinite (Blakeslee et al. 2001:94; see also Scott et al. 2006:Table 4). The White Rock phase is likely contemporaneous with the Dixon site of northwest Iowa, dating between A.D. 1300 and 1450 (Lo gan 1998). In Missouri, Oneota red pipestone artifacts appear to be mainly from surface, long-term, mixed, or later contexts (Jeff Yelton, personal com munication to Fishel 2008). Thus, determining the time frame of the initial use of Oneota red pipestone in Missouri is difficult. While there was sporadic and limited use of red pipestone in the late A.D. 1200s and 1300s by some Oneota groups, extensive Oneota utiliza tion and trade of this material can be viewed as primarily a post-A.D. 1400 phenomenon (cf. Boszhardt 1994; Fishel 1999; Henning 2007; Tiffany 1998) and appears to not have become a driving force in Oneota trade and exchange until after ca. A.D. 1450. Penman and Gundersen (1999:55) sug</page><page sequence="8">174 Richard L. Fishel et al. gest the increased use of Oneota pipestone in the Upper Mississippi Valley occurs even later, after A.D. 1550. It would be beneficial to subject the red pipestone artifacts from the above-mentioned Oneota sites, as well as those red pipestone pieces from Great Oasis, Mill Creek, and Nebraska phase sites, to PIMA analysis to better understand the sources and timing of red pipe stone/catlinite across this region and to then use the distributions to infer interaction models. Northwest Iowa Oneota The Oneota occupation of the Little Sioux valley in northwest Iowa focused on three widely separate localities within a ca. 150-km-long stretch of the valley. These localities were defined by Fishel (1999) as Correctionville, Cherokee, and Iowa Great Lakes. The sites within the Correctionville and Cherokee localities are dated to ca. A.D. 1300-1500. The Iowa Great Lakes locality represents the early historic contact period in the late 1600s (Fishel 1999:120-125; see also Henning 1998b:380-385). While the descendents of the Oneota that occupied the Correctionville and Cherokee localities are unknown at this time, the Iowa Great Lakes locality was likely occupied by the early historic Ioway (Henning 2007:75; Wedel 1986:47-48) and pos sibly the Oto. The Little Sioux valley is distinguished by the presence of seven large Oneota villages that are, from south to north, Dixon (13WD8), Gothier (13WD3), Correctionville (13WD6), Bastian (13CK28), Harriman (13CY1), Gillett Grove (13CY2), and Milford (13DK1) (Figure 1). The Dixon site (Fishel 1999; Harvey 1979), which is the southern-most Oneota village within the Little Sioux valley, may have been the first village occupied. In contrast, Milford, the northern-most village, appears to have been the last occupied. Gillett Grove (Doershuk 1997; Henning 1998b), Harriman (Hen ning 1998b), and Milford (Anderson 1994; Henning 1998b) within the Iowa Great Lakes locality all contain European historic trade items. These artifact types are absent from the other four Oneota villages in the Correc tionville and Cherokee localities. All of the large villages in this valley have yielded varying amounts of red pipestone artifacts in the form of pendants, disc and elbow pipes, tab lets, and scrap pieces. Based upon the valley's proximity to the catlinite quar ries in southwest Minnesota (the straight-line distance between the Dixon site and Pipestone, Minnesota is ca. 185 km, while the straight-line distance between Milford and Pipestone is ca. 120 km), researchers have generally assumed that all of these artifacts are manufactured from catlinite.</page><page sequence="9">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 175 Figure 1. Northwest Iowa locality showing locations of Oneota sites (®) and nearby known red pipestone source areas (A). As mentioned previously, red pipestone sources are found across the United States and Canada. The closest reported sources to the Oneota sites of northwest Iowa include the catlinite quarries in southwest Minnesota (Scott et al. 2006), cobbles occurring within the glacial drift spread throughout southeastern South Dakota in the Sioux Falls locality, eastern Nebraska, and eastern Kansas (known as "Kansas" pipestone) (Gundersen 1988; Gunder sen and O'Shea 1981; Penman and Gundersen 1999; Sigstad 1973), and cobbles within the glacial drift of Waterman Creek in O'Brien County, Iowa (Gundersen and Tiffany 1986) (Figure 1). During the 1994 Dixon investi gations (Fishel 1999), numerous red pipestone pieces, some in the form of nodules up to 10 cm in diameter, were found in the underlying glacial</page><page sequence="10">176 Richard L. Fishel et al. outwash. Six unworked red pipestone pebbles were also recovered during feature and hand unit excavations at the site. Three pieces of red pipestone were later collected in 1998 from gravel bars in Pierson Creek northwest of the town of Correctionville (Morrow and Mayer 2005:84, see Figure 1). The possibility exists that the Oneota were collecting red pipestone raw materials from local till exposures prior to discovering or heavily exploiting the catlin ite quarries of southwest Minnesota. Little Sioux Valley Oneota Sites and Blood Run Blood Run While the densest concentration of distinct northwest Iowa Oneota villages occurs within the Litde Sioux valley, we would be remiss not to mention the largest (ca. 800-1200 acres) Oneota site in northwest Iowa. The Blood Run site (13L02) is more aptly described as a locality rather than a site due to its large size and multiple occupations and mound groups (Harvey 1979; Hen ning 1998b, 2007; Schermer 1987). It is located at the confluence of Blood Run Creek and the Big Sioux River in Lyon County, Iowa and extends into adjacent Lincoln County, South Dakota (see Figure 1). Blood Run was likely first occupied by Oneota people ca. A.D. 1500, and is historically documented as the primary village of the Omaha during the late 1600s and early 1700s. Other inhabitants of Blood Run include the Ioway, Ponca, Arikara, and Oto (Henning 1998b). As mentioned earlier, Blood Run likely served as a redistri bution center for trade items, including red pipestone. Because the site has a lengthy occupational history including multiple groups, Blood Run red pipe stone artifacts were not subjected to PIMA analysis as part of this study. Dixon The Dixon site is estimated to cover 36 ha and appears to have been occu pied intermittently. Radiocarbon assays suggest the site was occupied from ca. A.D. 1300 to 1440 (Fishel 1999). Excavations conducted by the Univer sity of Wisconsin-Madison at Dixon in 1964 recovered eight red pipestone pieces (Harvey 1979:86-87) and excavations conducted in 1994 by the Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist recovered 19 pieces of red pipestone (Fishel 1999:60-61), including pebble-sized examples. In 1994 the senior author also collected numerous red pipestone pieces from the glacial till underlying the Dixon site. Twelve of the Dixon red pipestone artifacts (Fig ure 2a-j), as well as four till cobbles (Figure 3), were subjected to PIMA analysis.</page><page sequence="11">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 177 Figure 2.

One possible red pipestone pipe disc (Figure 2k) was submitted for PIMA analysis.</page><page sequence="13">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 179 Correctionville The Correctionville site may have been the last of the three Correctionville locality Oneota villages to be occupied (Fishel 1999; Henning 1961). Two radiocarbon assays have returned dates of 410 ± 80 B.P. (W1S-71) and 290 + 90 B.P. (WIS-35) (Tiffany 1981). The site's artifact inventory suggests Cor rectionville was occupied mainly during the fifteenth century. Fourteen red pipestone artifacts, consisting of 11 scrap pieces, two pipe discs, and one pipe fragment (Figure 2l-m), were submitted for PIMA analysis. Bastian Bastian is a little-studied Oneota village within the Cherokee locality which has produced a lone radiocarbon date of 390 ± 50 B.P. (WIS-284) (Tiffany 1981). The 10 red pipestone Stiles tablets exhibiting incised figures of ser pents, birds, birdmen, bison, arrows, and other anthropomorphic figures and animals, purportedly originate from Bastian (Bray 1963). Drawings of these tablets are pictured in Bray (1963:Figures 11-21) and we follow his numbering sequence for this analysis. The Sanford Museum of Cherokee, Iowa, also has approximately 40 additional red pipestone tablet fragments and numerous red pipestone pipe and scrap pieces from Bastian. In addi tion to the 10 Stiles tablets, 31 red pipestone objects from Bastian, consisting of 17 pipe fragments, 4 tablet fragments, 9 scrap pieces, and 1 cube (Figures 4a-c, 5-8), were analyzed. Harriman Information pertaining to the Harriman site is likewise sparse. This Iowa Great Lakes locality site once contained 12 mounds and has yielded Europe an trade items such as brass and glass beads, brass tinklers, and iron knives (Henning 1998b, 2007). Five pipestone items from Harriman, consisting of two pipe preforms and three scrap pieces were subjected to PIMA analysis. Gillett Grove Gillett Grove is a 4-8 ha upland village above the Little Sioux River within the Iowa Great Lakes locality that has been popular with archaeologists and artifact collectors since at least the 1920s (e.g., Harvey 1979; Henning 1961; Hull and Barglof 1966; Titcomb 2000). Beginning in the mid 1990s, the Iowa Lakeside Laboratory began conducting field schools at the site (Do ershuk 1997, 2002; Shott and Doershuk 1996). Gillett Grove has yielded</page><page sequence="14">180 Richard L. Fishel et al. Figure 4.

The cali brated 2-sigma range for the five Gillett Grove radiocarbon assays is A.D. 1634-1661 (Doershuk and Resnick 2008).

Milford The Milford site is the northern most and latest of the Oneota villages in the Iowa Great Lakes locality and is located approximately seven kilometers southwest of West Okoboji Lake in Dickinson County. This site has yielded a plethora of trade items, including glass beads, brass kettle fragments, silver Jesuit finger rings, a silver Apostle spoon fragment, metal gun parts, and gun flints (Anderson 1994). Almost 60 pieces of red pipestone were recovered from Milford during a 1978 Iowa Archaeological Society field school (An derson 1994), and more than 500 red pipestone pieces from Milford are in the possession of one artifact collector (Tiffany and Anderson 1993:Table 4). Seven red pipestone items recovered during the 1978 field school were subjected to PIMA analysis (Figure 4h-n). These consist of a near-complete elbow pipe, five pipe fragments, and a possible gaming piece. PIMA Results Table 1 shows the samples analyzed from each site. Table 2 shows the dis tribution of the different types of pipestones at each site. To date, our team has characterized pipestone sources in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Wiscon sin, Kansas, and Missouri (Emerson et al. 2005; Hughes et al. 1998) (Figure 9). After spectra are acquired by the PIMA spectrometer, PIMAView software is used to manipulate each spectrum and compare it to reference collections of spectra. These reference spectra were created through the analysis of hun dreds of known quarry specimens by the PIMA project personnel in over a decade of quarry sampling. In our analysis, hull spectra are particularly useful because this function removes background distractions and sharpens features. The hull is conceptually like a string stretched tightly over the top of the spectrum and anchored at each end. A "hull quotient" is calculated by dividing the value of the spectrum by the value of the hull at each wave length position (Horsefall 2001:36). Chemically, many of the pipestone sources are similar, but the way the chemical ingredients are combined in minerals and the staictural details of those minerals give virtually a 100 percent separation between the vari ous pipestone groups (Table 3). The technique is sufficiently refined that we have been able to discover mineral variation within what were previously thought of as homogeneous pipestones. For example, we have discovered</page><page sequence="17">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 183 Barron Wisconsin Pipestone Minnesota Pipestone Baraboo Illinois Pipestone Ohio Pipestone Kansas\ Pipestone \ Figure 9.

Kansas pipestone appears very similar to Catlinite B when PIMA spec tra are overlaid, but there are key differences at 1410, 2195, and 2165 nm (Figure 11). Both pipestones show up as "100 percent pyrophyllite" using the basic mineral ID in our software PIMAView, but X-ray diffraction shows that the Kansas pipestone has quartz as the most abundant mineral with no muscovite. In contrast, Catlinite B can have a small amount of muscovite, no quartz, and significant diaspore. The reason for this discrepancy is that quartz is invisible to the PIMA instrument (Wisseman et al. 2002). While most (86 percent) of our northwest Iowa Oneota samples are good matches for Minnesota catlinite (Figures 12, 13), this group also contains Kansas pipestone, Barron County (Wisconsin) pipestone, pure muscovite, and a "Wisconsin-type" kaolinite (Table 2). Figure 12 compares a hull spectra overlay of Catlinite A to Sample 5978-101-20 from the Correctionville site and Figure 13 compares Catlinite B to Sample 81-2 from the Milford site. Figure 14 shows a hull spectra overlay of Sample 1103-9 from the Dixon site and an artifact made from Kansas pipestone, while Figure 15 shows a hull overlay revealing another match between Sample 3477-128 from the Bastian site and pure pyrophyllite, suggesting our sample is Kansas pipestone.</page><page sequence="21">Figure 11.

Three other artifacts from three sites are also identified as a Wisconsin-type kaolinite (Table 2). Wisconsin-type kaolinite is so-named because it was originally identified within Wisconsin. The geographical range of Wiscon sin-type kaolinite is yet unknown, but, as just mentioned, it does occur with in the till of northwest Iowa as well as Wisconsin.

Conclusions The working hypothesis of this study was that the Oneota of the Little Sioux valley utilized red pipestone from the local till of northwest Iowa before discovering the catlinite source area of southwest Minnesota (cf. Gundersen and Tiffany 1986; Penman and Gundersen 1999). Our study has shown,</page><page sequence="24">190 Richard L. Fishel et al. however, that while the Dixon inhabitants were collecting red pipestones from the glacial till (presumably of northwest Iowa, but possibly also from more western till sources), as indicated by the presence of worked scrap and nodules of muscovite, Wisconsin-type kaolinite, and pyrophyllite at Dixon, the site's inhabitants were also aware of the catlinite quarries and heavily utilized them. Some of the Dixon artifacts, as well as samples from Cor rectionville and Bastian, are manufactured from Kansas pipestone. The only one of the four prehistoric Little Sioux valley Oneota sites not to yield Kan sas pipestone is Gothier. However, because only one artifact was available for testing from Gothier, this absence may be due to the single sample. The presence of Kansas pipestone at these sites compares favorably with Fishel's (1996, 1999:128-132) hypothesis that the Dixon inhabitants were collect ing lithic raw materials from the Kansas/Nebraska area, possibly while on communal bison hunts there. With one exception, all of the tested samples from the three protohis toric sites in the Iowa Great Lakes locality (Harriman, Gillett Grove, and Milford) originated from the catlinite quarries. The lone exception was likely collected from local glacial till. While the low number of Wisconsin pipe stone artifacts in our sample may be due to the small sample size of the tested artifacts, it may also suggest that contact between northwest Iowa and Wisconsin Oneota groups was limited (cf. Finney and Crawford 1999:59). It should be noted, however, that most of the analyzed red pipestone arti facts originating from Wisconsin Oneota sites are true catlinite as opposed to Wisconsin pipestone (Penman and Gundersen 1999). Kansas pipestone does occur at Wisconsin Oneota sites, thus the Wisconsin Oneota groups themselves may not have been heavily exploiting the Wisconsin sources. The lack of Kansas pipestone in our study from the protohistoric Iowa sites sug gests that trade emphasis for the northwest Iowa Oneota may have shifted by this time from the west to the east, likely in an effort to obtain European items (cf. Henning 2007:75). The near-absence of pipestones collected from the till at the protohistoric sites also suggests a shift in pipestone procure ment from both till sources and catlinite quarries to the near-exclusive utili zation of the catlinite quarries (cf. Gundersen and Tiffany 1986:63). Emerson and Hughes (2001), in noting that the rise in the use of cat linite coincides with the decline of Cahokia, speculated that this Minnesota pipestone might have replaced the red Missouri flint clays used exclusively for Cahokia figurines, which presumably were imbued with great spiritual power. The shift from southern flint clay to northern catlinite would then parallel the late prehistoric shift in regional cultural dominance from the southern Cahokians to the northern Oneota groups.</page><page sequence="25">Red Pipestone Artifacts from Oneota Villages 191 We also observe an intriguing pattern in the use of "red pipestones" versus catlinite at the northwest Iowa Oneota sites. While sampling is always an issue, we note that, despite the presence of several types of red pipestone, 29 of the 30 dearly defined pipes or pipe fragments and all 14 of our tablet specimens were sourced to the catlinite quarries. We can suggest two pos sible reasons for this near exclusivity in pipe and tablet material. First, it is possible, at least in the case of the till sources, that the generally small size of the nodules usually precluded their use to manufacture pipes. Catlinite, because it is found in large, thick strata is ideal for making pipes, especially the disk forms. The second reason for the almost exclusive use of catlinite for pipes and tablets may relate to the spiritual power of the catlinite quarries. Historically we know from accounts by Lewis and Clark (Thwaites 1904:115, 1905:44 45) and by Catlin (1973 [1844]:167-169) that the Sioux and neighboring tribes considered the area around the Minnesota catlinite quarries to be sa cred and the red stone powerful. It is possible that from the inception of the late prehistoric quarrying of catlinite that it carried an aura of spiritual pow er making it especially desirable as a material for ceremonial pipes. If our speculation is correct, it suggests that to at least the northwest Iowa Oneota groups, all "red pipestones" were not equal. While the red till materials were suitable for items such as pendants, the northwest Iowa Oneota may not have considered the till material as having suitable spiritual power for pipe and tablet use. This potentially differential use of the red pipestone sources by prehistoric people is worth considering in future investigations. Acknowledgments.
