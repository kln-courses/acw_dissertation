<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALOGICAL PREDICATION THE suggestion that religious discourse leans heavily upon the use of analogy, especially in its references to Deity, was de- veloped in considerable detail by the scholastics. It has also been re- vived recently as an account of the nature of the meaning which the language of religion typically, if not uniquely, employs.' Con- currently with its recent revival, however, there has been displayed considerable resistance to the view that the meaning of religious predicates is analogical.2 This paper seeks to show, first, that this resistance is not likely to be mitigated by the Thomistic view of analogical predication. But, second, an alternative view of analogi- cal predication is here proposed which its author believes can be de- fended successfully as a justification for speaking about "the ana- logical truth" of some religious utterances. 1For a defense of analogy in religious discourse, see Raphael Demos, "Are Religious Dogmas Cognitive and Meaningful?"

Such assertions are pos- sible, however, only if the meaning of the terms predicated of God and creatures is neither equivocal nor univocal. Since "there is a certain mode of likeness of things to God," 3 and it is possible to prove many things about God, as would not be the case if all such attempts involved the fallacy of equivocation,4 the terms predi- cated of God are not entirely equivocal. But neither are such terms predicated univocally of God and creatures. God as Prime Agent so far exceeds His creatures in power and glory that what- ever is predicated of God must be understood as far transcending any similar thing in creatures. Hence the names predicated of God are used in an analogous sense, "that is, according to the sense of proportion. " 5 Two kinds of analogy are distinguished by St. Thomas. The first involves an analogical meaning based on a relation, or "propor- tion," of many things to one. Thus "healthy" may be predicated of an animal, as the subject of health, of medicine as the cause of health, of food as the preserver of health, and of urine as the sign of health.6 The names of God cannot be predicated of Him ac- cording to this kind of analogy, however, because to do so would in- volve our positing something prior to God as that to which He is related along with other things. But nothing can be prior to God. The second kind of analogy is based on the relation of two things, not to some third thing, but to one of them. Thus "healthy" may be predicated of both medicine and animal body since medicine is the cause of the health in the animal body. It is in this latter way that names are predicated of God: "whatever is said of God and creatures, is said according to the order that exists of a creature to God as its principle and cause; wherein pre-exist excellently all perfections of things."7 We cannot here examine in detail the Thomistic use of analogi- cal predication in references to God. Suffice it to point out that the basis of such predication "is the resemblance which an effect always preserves in relation to its cause, however inferior to it it may be." 8 The resemblance, or "proportion," is not that of God 3 Summa Contra Gentiles, I, 33. 4 Summa Theologica, I, xiiii, 5. 5 Summa Theol., I, xiii, 5. 6 Contra Gentiles, I, 34. 7 Summa Theol., I, xiii, 5. 8 E.

But it is in terms of "the relation binding each effect to its cause" which is "the only link enabling us to make an accurate ascent from creature to Creator." 9 The resemblance which effects may bear to their cause varies according to whether the effects are contained in the same species or genus as their cause, or whether, as in the case of God, the agent is not contained in any genus. Since every agent "acts from its form, the effect must in some way resemble the form of the agent. " 10 When the agent is contained in the same species as its effect, agent and effect have a specific formal likeness. When agent and effect are not contained in the same species but in the same genus, agent and effect have a generic formal likeness. But since God is not contained in any genus, his effects (creatures) can be said to "par- ticipate in the likeness of the agent's form . . . only according to some sort of analogy; as existence is common to all."" Thus it can be said, according to St Thomas, that all created things are like God so far as they exist, since God is the "First and universal prin- ciple of all being." 12 But still the likeness of creatures to God may be affirmed "solely according to analogy; inasmuch as God ex- ists of His own Essence, and others in dependence upon Him." 13 This account of the analogy between God and His creatures can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory. Despite the denial that agnos- ticism is its necessary result,14 its supporters are at a loss to explain in what way it makes possible true statements about God. Indeed it must be admitted that the perfections attributed to God are in Him in a way which is "wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures." 15 To invoke the use of analogy at this point is merely to beg the question. For it is clear that a "perfec- tion" such as "intelligence" may be attributed to God only as a finite effect of that which is its Infinite Cause. And to say that such an effect can be said to resemble God "solely according to analogy" is, in the absence of any specific or generic likeness, to invoke another analogy to explain the analogy in question, and thus to fall into an infinite regress of analogical explanations. The ignorance which we suffer at this point is as it should be, according to Gilson,16 since we can never know God's essence in this life. But if so, the appeal to analogy in the first place loses its point. 9 Ibid., p. 106. 10 Summa Theol., I, iv, 3. 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid. '3 Ibid. 14 See, for example, G. M.

J., in a chapter entitled "The Meaning of the Terms Predicated of God" has recently formulated a version of the Thomist position on analogical predication,17 but with no more success than attends the classical attempt. He rejects the view that statements about God are purely mythical in character and function solely to evoke emotion- and conduct-responses. They are either true or false "in the sense of asserting a state of affairs which does or does not obtain." 18 But now the problem arises of specifying the meaning of terms such as "personal" and "intel- ligent" when predicated of God. If such predicates are construed literally, the result is anthropomorphism. On the other hand, if by "intelligent" we do not mean literally that God is quick at drawing inferences or clever in solving problems, the alternative seems to be agnosticism. For in this case "no attribute [can] be significantly predicated of Him." 19 The objectionable consequences of this dilemma are avoided, Copleston thinks, by maintaining that "the terms which are predicated of both finite things and God must be used analogically when they are predicated of God, if they have any meaning at all. " 20 Copleston's explication of analogical predication in references to God is based on a distinction between the "objective meaning" and the "subjective meaning" of a term: between "that which is objectively referred to or 'meant' by a term and my understanding or conception of what is referred to." 21 This is not a distinction between the true, or real, meaning of a term and a merely subjective meaning, but rather between my (possibly inadequate) conception of what is referred to and the reality itself to which the term (pri- marily?) refers. Thus in saying that God is intelligent, I distin- guish between the meaning this term has for me, based on my ex- perience with human intelligence, and the "purified" meaning of this term which results from the employment of the way of nega- tion. This via negativa enables us to avoid anthropomorphism in references to God, while acknowledgment of the objective meaning of such a predicate as "intelligent" avoids agnosticism. As Coples- ton puts it: In our language about God we always move within the sphere of analogy. We have no direct natural apprehension of God, and we can have no natural knowledge of Him save by way of reflection on the things which do fall within 17 Ch.

Hence the use of analogy. What I have called the "objec- tive meaning " of the terms predicated of God transcends our experience. Hence it cannot be positively and adequately described. All we can do is to attempt to purify the " subjective meaning. " 1 22 This view of analogical predication is, in my opinion, no im- provement over that of classical Thomism. In fact, it is a distinct weakening of that position, I believe, in that it is offered without the support of the metaphysics of the earlier view. But again the net result is agnosticism. We simply cannot claim any knowledge of God by this method. Since the so-called "objective meaning" of the terms predicated of God falls completely outside of any pos- sible experience that man can have in this life, the analogy is quite useless. To be told that the meaning of "intelligent" as predicated of God is analogical as compared to its meaning as predicated of man, but that there is no specific basis for the analogy which we can know, is not to avoid agnosticism but to embrace it. Suppose we grant, for the sake of argument, that it is possible to distinguish my conception of God from what God is in Himself. It still re- mains a puzzle as to how my knowledge of God is in any way ad- vanced by such a distinction. For if I would proceed to "purify" the subjective meaning of such a term as "intelligent" in order to make its meaning correspond more closely to its objective meaning, which in this case is God Himself, I am completely at a loss even as to the direction such "purification" should take, quite apart from being totally ignorant as to how far it should extend. Since the objective meaning of the terms predicated of God transcends any possible experience, I can never know even how the signification of terms is not to be applied to God. As a matter of fact, the use of the via negativa in this connection seems in itself to presuppose a knowledge of God. How could I possibly know that God does not have a body, for example, unless I already knew that the characteristic of having a body was in- compatible with the nature of God? But how could I know this unless I had a knowledge of God's nature that was sufficient to en- able me to deny that the characteristic of having a body is properly predicable of Him? I could never affirm positively that "bodili- ness" is inconsistent with God's nature unless I could know, in some sense, what God is. But if this is true, then the thesis that God's essence is unknowable in this life cannot be maintained. III The consequence of this criticism is not, I think, that we must abandon the use of analogy in our references to God. Rather what 22 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">860 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY we need is a redefinition of "analogy." This term itself must be so defined as to enable us to use it without ending in agnosticism. But at the same time we want to remain faithful to the tradition which maintains at least a difference in kind between God and things. This, of course, was the aim of Thomist philosophy. But it could not realize this aim, given the conception of Deity with which it began. The suggestion here proposed is that, in order to employ analogi- cal predication in religious discourse, we must hold that any two entities standing in an analogical relation to each other, including the Deity, must have a minimum of one property in common. " God is love" is analogically true, for example, only if all entities, in- cluding God, of which "love" is predicated share at least one prop- erty. We may thus avoid agnosticism by the view that what may be truly asserted about God may also be truly asserted, at least in part, about things other than God. One question which is sure to arise at this point is whether such a view of analogical predication does not entail anthropomorphism. I believe that this consequence is avoided by the stipulation that terms which are analogous in meaning always have overlapping significations. As Rudolph Otto has pointed out,23 in illustration of a similar point, the statement, "he loves me," has the same verbal form when uttered by a child of its father and by a girl of her lover. Nevertheless there is a qualitative, and not merely a quantitative, difference between the love of the father for the child and the love of the lover for the girl. At the same time, however, we would probably agree that there is some sense in which the word 'love" means the same thing in both cases. In other words, there is an analogy, but not identity, of meaning for the term "love" as used in these two cases. In somewhat more technical language, there is a difference in signification to be noted in these two uses of "love" in the sense that the combination of properties signified by one is different from the combination of properties signified by the other. Hence the meaning (i.e. the signification) of these two terms is not identical, or univocal. But neither are they completely equivocal. And because they are not completely equivocal, we are justified in using the same term, "love," in both cases. They are not completely equivocal because some (at least one) but not all of the properties signified by the term in the first case are identical with some but not all of the properties signified in the other. What is more, if necessary, we could designate the common properties signified by both terms. I would maintain that this is exactly the situation which obtains 23 Ch. VII of The Idea of the Holy.</page><page sequence="7">ANALOGICAL PREDICATION 861 when terms having one meaning when predicated of other things are predicated analogically of God. Whether we are talking about the "fear" of God as a quality of experience when confronted by Deity, or the "love" of God as a kind of affection God has for His creatures, we are using such predicates analogically. While such terms are not completely equivocal in meaning, as compared with their "ordinary" use, they are not univocal either. The term "love" is predicated analogically of God and man, and it is on this basis that we can say that "God is love" is a statement which is analogically true. It is analogically rather than literally true be- cause "love" when predicated of God is understood to signify a combination of properties which is different from the combination of properties signified by "love" when predicated of man. On the other hand, the statement is not completely equivocal either, for the combination of properties signified by "love" when predicated of God includes at least one property in the combination of properties signified by that term when predicated of man. The word "love" is being used ambiguously when predicated of God compared to its use in other contexts. But the ambiguity can always be clarified by designating the properties signified by this term when predi- cated of God, and comparing these properties with those signified by the same term when predicated of other things. Whenever an analogical meaning is involved, the two sets of properties will over- lap. Thus "love" as predicated of God may signify, among other things, the property of having tender concern, and the same prop- erty may be signified by this term when predicated of a human father in his relation to his children. In other words, having tender concern is a property signified in common in both cases of its predication. Another question which may be anticipated is whether in this view of analogical predication justice is done to what religious people sometimes refer to as the "majesty" of God, i.e., His transcendence over all earthly categories and things. I believe such "majesty," or transcendence, is preserved by the circumstance that the terms predicated of God signify a combination of properties which is unique and hence qualitatively different from those signi- fied by the same terms when predicated of other things. The fact that God may be said to share some properties with His creatures does not, in itself, necessarily impugn His "majesty" inasmuch as He may still be regarded as, in some sense, qualitatively "above" His creatures. We cannot here consider the many other issues raised by this view of analogical predication except to note, in conclusion, that this approach has the merit, in its author's opinion, of providing a</page><page sequence="8">862 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY basis for a sound explanation for the claim to a "natural" knowl- edge of God. Since a consequence of this formulation of what is involved in analogical predication is that God cannot be regarded as having no properties in common with anything else, the property (or properties) He shares with others places Him in a class with other things. Such class membership may provide the starting- point for non-analogical assertions about God which can be said to constitute knowledge claims. PAUL C.
