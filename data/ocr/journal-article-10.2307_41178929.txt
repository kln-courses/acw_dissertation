<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEEP JOKES: Reflections on Ultimate Explanation in Metaphysics and Myth Steven G. Smith J've spent a lot of time with questions that are inherently large and intractable - questions, for example, about the nature of the basic possibility of the existence of things and about the basic conditions of meaningful human action. Such questions are com- monly called "ultimate" because they seem to haunt the farthest horizons of our thinking and feeling, where we can go no further on a given line or with a given type of inquiry. (Of course, no question is "ultimate" in the sense that its meaning does not de- pend on how some other questions are handled.) Experience with philosophical and religious treatments of ultimate questions can lead one to wonder: What, in general, makes for a compel- ling way of handling an ultimate question? What sort of idea or formulation is the most rewarding in such cases? This question might presume too much, either about ideas or about myself. There might not be any eminent pattern to find. As it turns out, though, I do find my attention drawn back con- sistently to certain favorite metaphysical and theological propos- als. These are ideas that I don't perfectly understand or feel entirely inclined to embrace, but they impress me (and many others) as profoundly interesting and promising, and - here's the kicker - I find that they share a somewhat unexpected char- acter of being funny. They are typically put forward and dis- cussed as though they were serious and straightforward explanations of ultimate matters, but in addition to their explan- atory aspect they have the aspect of a joke. Further, they are Steven G. Smith is Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippl. Soundings 83.1 (Spring 2000).

Smith funny not incidentally but at the same level and with the same kind of force, so to speak, as their explanatory content - in- deed, that is a major part of their interest and possibly of their promise. There is more in them than a generic funniness of human beings trying to explain everything. They have a penetrat- ing meaning. They are not to be dismissed. They are deep jokes. My experience in these matters could be similar to yours, or dissimilar - we will have to see - but for the time being I will dare to pose the question as concerning an objectively discussible meaning: How are deep jokes constituted and how are they compelling? *f* *l* *l* *l^ ^1^ Jokes raise questions and deal with them in a nonordinary way. A joke typically fabricates and imposes a question that didn't arise "naturally." You were not previously wondering why a chicken would cross the road. Yet the joke question wasn't com- pletely strange or lacking in relevance: if a joke is resonant at all, it engages an interest you do have, perhaps a general curiosity about how animals make up their minds, or what it is to have a mind. In both their superficial irrelevance and underlying rele- vance, joke-questions differ from the ordinary questions that arise "naturally" as we run into gaps in our working knowledge while going about our business. An ordinary question opens up like a pothole across which you have to throw some sort of plank in order to advance on your path. Its immediate relevance is clear, but it need have no farther-reaching relevance at all. "Which road leads to Memphis?" is of front-and-center interest when traveling to Memphis and of no interest otherwise. Once answered, an ordinary question is left behind. But a joke keeps coming up, precisely because it comes out of left field. Like jokes, ultimate philosophical and religious explanations are artificial, outlandish, and persistent. You can't engage them if you haven't been initiated into asking an unusual kind of ques- tion to which they supply an answer. For example, there is a Pla- tonic thesis that chairs are real because they participate in the abstract form of chairness, and there is a Christian doctrine that the fundamental power of the world was incarnate in a certain human individual; to understand either of these ideas, you must have been led to question not just this or that step in your daily</page><page sequence="3">Deep Jokes 23 path but what a path is and what's involved in trying to be on a path at all. When a question is about the nature of life as a whole, it may never come up, or it may be disregarded - one can just plug along, living the life one has got - but if such a question really does register, it can never be left behind. The great explanations might seem to be opposite to jokes in that they purport to really explain something, or everything, while jokes are usually funny in part because their punch lines don't give true explanations. The contrast here lessens on further con- sideration. An ultimate explanation may not wear a provocatively false face the way a joke does, but it is not obviously true or con- clusive either. Indeed, it is non-conclusive not only in the sense that its merits relative to other doctrines can be debated end- lessly but also in a more structural, built-in way: one can be con- vinced by an ultimate explanation, firmly inscribe it in one's mind, and yet, since it is grasped at such a distance from ordinary things and causal connections, one is bound to go on wondering how exactly it relates to other ideas and how it applies to con- crete situations. (Thus Plato's Socrates was wedded to the hy- pothesis of Forms but perplexed by the difficulties raised against this idea in Parmenides; and the amazing development of Chris- tian theology through the centuries bears witness to the continu- ally unsettling influence of the doctrine of divine incarnation.) Ordinarily, an explanation puts us in a position of cognitive mastery. Once we see why something is the way it is, once the relevant reasons and causes have been shown to us, we are free from surprise or confusion in our relationship with it. For exam- ple, once it's been explained to me how an automobile engine works, I may be surprised by the fact that my car won't start this morning, but I'm aware of reasons why such a thing happens. The explanation puts me in a position to check the battery, the spark plugs, etc. Or a response to a question may not be particularly analytical or technically empowering and yet still tell the hearer exactly what he or she needs to know, as when the daughter in Ring Lardner's story gets this from her father: "'Shut up,' he ex- plained" (704). Some people always ask about the meaning of life or about the one thing needful for salvation, and Zen Buddhist traditions re- spond with a collection of ultimate answers that are at least as much jokes as explanations, the koans. "What is Buddha?" "A dry</page><page sequence="4">24 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith turd" (Wumenguan, no. 121). A koan is usually embedded in an anecdote telling how a disciple approached a master at a particu- lar point in the quest for enlightenment. The answer to the disci- ple's question is peremptory and shocking: at some level the master is telling the disciple to shut up. And this is an important message for the disciple to receive. He is being rebuffed in his attempt to construe the question of life in an unenlightened way. His mind needs to change radically. If simple rebuff were the only significance of koans, though, they would be interchangea- ble with each other and with any other dismissive gesture, whereas in practice an extensive literature of koans is transmitted and carefully used (especially in Rinzai Zen schools) to advance the insight of Zen practitioners. The goal of Zen inquiry can be described with misleading simplicity as a non-objectivizing or non-dual consciousness, but to attain or present this desired con- sciousness is no less complex an affair than is the delusory world within which we seek it. Knots must be untied in a variety of cog- nitive and emotional contexts in order to continue to make pro- gress toward enlightenment or inhabit it. The koans are tests of perspicuity corresponding to particular threads in the logic of our existence. Both like and unlike ordinary riddles, they both are and aren't "solved": on the one hand, the object of studying koans is to surpass the state in which they simply pose an obstacle to understanding, but on the other hand, the answers and inter- pretations that can be given for koans are always only suggestive, never completely determining for any inquirer. A koan must be lived with. How is it that koans are funny? They exemplify the general nature of jokes in following the "wrong is right" principle. A question projects an answer of one kind; an answer of a threaten- ingly wrong kind is given (not like some well-considered exercise of poetic license); but the answer establishes itself as appropriate on its own terms. We are sufficiently engaged by the new way of thinking and feeling made available by the joke's answer that we agree to adopt it. With ordinary jokes, we merely play at living in the world of the answer - we wouldn't dream of seriously ac- cepting the mind of the more aggressive or "sick" jokes, for ex- ample, because we don't find such a mind truly congenial - but in the case of the koan I mentioned, really to accept the answer "a dry trrd" is desirable because the goal is to be able to do with-</page><page sequence="5">Deep Jokes 25 out the objectivizing habit of mind that the question represents. The koan joke would become a non-joke if one settled entirely into the Tightness of its well-interpreted answer. But even the most radiantly enlightened human being retains a relationship with ordinary humanity, and within that relationship the clarify- ing mind entertains the incongruity and the sense of a break- through in resolving the misfit between question and answer in favor of the answer. The funny energy of jokes is built up by the incongruity, the wrongness, and then explosively released in the solution, the new lightness. A joke launches like a spring-loaded missile. If an ordi- nary answer is like a plank across a pothole, a joke is like a flight over a wall or a sea of troubles. To get a joke is to be above and beyond the ordinary world. Normally, an explanation has the op- posite effect of landing us solidly somewhere. Once we've gotten a good explanation, our feet are on the ground and our hands are firmly on the levers of the situation we are addressing. The whole system of koan use in Zen seems designed to get the launching and flying of good jokes together with the firm orien- tation and detailed, applicable insight of good explanations. To become enlightened, we need to reach escape velocity from the delusory world and at the same time we need to know how to navigate through it. We must be able to sustain our escape, to make some sort of world out of our break with the world. One koan in isolation might pack a jolt, but it passes too easily as the cheap fix of a casually good joke. On the other hand, a textbook explanation of koans (such as I might be offering now, I shudder to think) might stand up well over time, but it is too easily ac- cepted as the ordinary kind of practical benefit, so that we ha- ven't gotten the better of the world after all. An ultimate explanation must contain incongruity because it presumes to relate finite beings to infinite or inherently indeter- minate horizons. Whether the incongruity is felt as sharp, and whether that sharpness is felt as funny or sublime or merely pain- ful, depends on how exactly the terms of explanation match up with the worldly terms to be explained. Probably the most famil- iar example we could consider is theism, which explains the world as the work of one or more supremely powerful, personal beings. To think of a being like you or me controlling the uni- verse is incongruous. Supposing that a personal being controls</page><page sequence="6">26 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith the universe, to compare ourselves with such a person or to think of having a relationship with such a person is incongruous. Rep- resenting the supreme power of the universe anthropomorphi- cally is incongruous, but if we completely got rid of anthropomorphism we would deny any personhood in the di- vine, which, according to theists, would leave us with a wholly unsatisfying explanation. Finally, in the general order of explana- tions it is incongruous that an explanation should land us in di- lemmas of incongruousness. So there is incongruousness everywhere a theist turns. Is it funny? Is there a "flying" release from the tension of these incongruities? Some god-stories seem geared in part to provide such release. Homer's god scenes are often like this, with their all-too-human god psychology of lust, envy, and malice; the beginning of the book of Job is like this, with God making a perverse deal with Satan to inflict grotesque sufferings on a good man. However, there is a terrible sublimity in the end of the book of Job, where God uses the human tactic of legal self-vindication to prove the absurdity of calling God into account. We are not "flying" or "ahead of the world" in the posi- tion the book of Job leaves us in, we are very much in the world and behind God - unless we fly vicariously by identifying finally with the transcendent God rather than Job, which may be the book's punch line. I would like to give more careful attention now to two ultimate explanations that have foundational importance in Western phil- osophical and religious tradition. They are taken very seriously, as befits foundational claims. They are supposed to tell us a firmly orienting truth about our world. But they are funny, and I want to see what their funniness has to do with their possible truth and what this implies about the genres of ultimate explana- tion they belong to - namely, metaphysics and myth, or, more specifically, creation story. ***** I begin with a theory of being offered by the Greek thinker who is often credited with discovering the very topic of being and the whole project of philosophical idealism. Parmenides of Elea appears to have flourished in the early 5th century BCE. We have extensive quoted fragments from a treatise he composed in verse. The earlier philosophers of phusis, "nature," had specu-</page><page sequence="7">Deep Jokes 27 lated about the world's ultimate ingredients in materialistic terms like earth and air, rarefaction and condensation, trying to explain the combination of continuity and change in our experi- ence; Parmenides shifted the basic question, asking not about the possibility of "nature" but about the possibility of there being anything to think about truly, the possibility of being itself, or of the character of being as itself and not as it is misleadingly ban- died about by implication in the various things we say and think about things in our experience. His key point is that it is impossi- ble to think nothing, and thus no perception or reasoning that posits nothing can be true. But all claims of change depend on something coming to be from nothing or becoming nothing from something. Therefore all claims and assumptions of change are false. The true way to think about what is is not by concepts of changeable things but strictly by the concept of being. How, then, are we to think being purely, to recognize it adequately? So far it looks as if nothing very funny is in store in Parmeni- des's ontology. He seems to be addressing the extremely abstract issue of the nature of the realness of what is real, that is, to say accurately what is true of any real thing just in the respect that it is real. At least, he would be most comfortably read by many phi- losophers in that way. Like many theists, however, Parmenides seems to have a dominant interest in the supreme Being taken not as an aspect or attribute of things in our experience but as a Being in its own right, as a commanding object of our attention. (Some commentators think Parmenides was influenced by ear- lier efforts by Xenophanes to conceive a perfect, non-anthropo- morphic God [Kirk, Raven, Schofield 240-41].) How will Parmenides handle the logical incongruity of portraying Being as a being? (Compare: what would it mean to treat "number" as a number?) How can the unique, utterly comprehensive reality be presented as one of the things we might look at? Parmenides has argued that Being, the object of thought inso- far as thought stays strictly away from what-is-not, is necessarily "uncreated and imperishable . . . whole and of a single kind and unshaken," without past or future, and perfectly continuous and homogeneous (Kirk, Raven, Schofield 249-51). But since Being perfectly exists, it requires determinacy. A limitless Being would be just a haze, no better than nothing. And so, "since there is a furthest limit, [Being] is perfected, like the bulk of a ball</page><page sequence="8">28 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith [sphairos] well-rounded on every side, equally balanced in every direction from the center" (Kirk, Raven, Schofield 252). A ball? Yes, sphairos means "ball." Perhaps a more dignified-sounding word would be "sphere," and that is the word most often used in the Parmenides literature, but I for one cannot keep a straight face even in likening Being to a sphere, since I can't help envi- sioning a great big cannonball or beach ball. Of course, Parmeni- des doesn't say Being literally is a beach ball, he only compares it to one to make a point about its perfect consistency and determi- nacy. Still . . . Would Parmenides's argument come off better if the reference to the ball were taken out? Theological discussions of God pur- sue some of the same Parmenidean points about perfect being and never once mention a ball. I suspect that most theologians are not even tempted to liken God to a ball because they believe (whether in piety or for intellectual reasons of their own) that God is infinite; they don't share Parmenides's assumption that the supreme being needs limits if it is really to exist. When theists need a model or simile of God, their imagination runs to per- sonal forms (king, shepherd, etc.). But Parmenides seems to have an important double point here, one he shares with the older critic of anthropomorphism, Xenophanes: if the supreme Being is to be conceived purely, unrestricted by our limitations, then all creaturely physiognomies have to be ironed out of its image - which would leave us with something like a smooth sphere. The other is that if Being is to be conceived as existing in anything like the way existents exist, it must be significantly like something we can experience as existing. You may prefer to com- pare it to a fog and not a ball, but there must be some such legiti- mate comparison. And any such comparison puts us in a funny position. We human thinkers, who are supposedly adjusting our horizons radically inward and outward so as to entertain the truth of Being, are really poking through a fog or holding (if not tossing) a ball - we cannot not have the initiative, the practical superiority, in our relation with the object of our discourse. We could remove ourselves from this incongruity by sticking with a very austere or mystical way of talking about Being. We would have a better-sounding ontology then. But would we have a nec- essarily truer ontology in the most meaningful sense? Would we be as honest?</page><page sequence="9">Deep Jokes 29 Parmenides was brave enough to enforce on Being what he took the requirements of pure thinking to be. The requirement of determinacy and limit for perfection resulted in Being being ball-like. I doubt that he intended the ball simile as a satire on the project of bringing thinking and being together. The satire that needed to be carried out, from the Parmenidean perspec- tive, was that of his disciple Zeno, who in his famous paradoxes of motion showed the absurdities that come from affirming a coher- ent fit between rational thought and the changeful objects of or- dinary experience. You assume, for example, that a runner can run to any given point on a track, but mathematical reasoning tells you that wherever the runner is, an infinite number of points remain to be reached before the destination, and since each must be reached in turn, the runner can never arrive (Kirk, Raven, Schofield 270). On first hearing Zeno's perverse results, one is moved to laugh at rational thought, not at worldly events; but the joke within the joke (for a convinced Parmenidean) is that the worldly events cannot really be what they seem. Parmenides's own follow-up to his ontology is a discourse on "nature" much like that of his predecessors, making use espe- cially of the principles of light and darkness. He disparagingly calls this a "way of opinion" in contrast with the ontological "way of truth." He says he wants to provide the reader with the most reasonable cosmology possible so that "no thought of mortal men shall ever outstrip you" (Kirk, Raven Schofield 255-56). And you shall know the nature of aither and all the signs in it and the destructive works of the pure torch of the shining sun, and whence they came into being; and you shall hear of the wandering works of the round-eyed moon and of her nature; and you shall know too of the surrounding heaven, whence it grew and how Ne- cessity guiding it fettered it to hold the limits of the stars. . . . (Kirk, Raven, Schofield 258) But this Parmenidean cosmology is related to other cosmologies in the way that a comedian's parody of a political speech is re- lated to a politician's speech. We are clued in about the whole class of cosmologies as we note the correspondences between his model, which he presents with a devastating caveat, and all the others. Where does Parmenides leave us? Wrong is right. Reason and being are misfits in their relationship, yet we carry the rela- tionship forward. The obvious key to metaphysical incongruity in general is that metaphysics is meant to deal with issues that tran-</page><page sequence="10">30 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith scend nature while at the same time it has to be somewhat natu- ral in its reasoning. Plato's forms are logically required not to be like things, and yet we have to approach them and arrange rela- tions with them as though they were things. Leibniz's monads are logically required to be nonspatial, but to understand them as the ultimate constituents of our reality we have to place them everywhere as little atoms. This is a point not merely about the limits of our imagination but about the logic of explanation, the necessary continuity between the somehow deeper terms of ex- planation and the more familiar terms to be explained. The most intriguing and potentially funny metaphysical explanations con- tain a jolt we rebound from Parmenides's smooth ball, we get tangled and pulled in Plato's forms, we are inundated and brim- ming with Leibnizian monads. Such is the energy that launches us in the metaphysical kind of flight. 5jC 5JC îjî 5|C 5JC My other main exhibit is the second creation story in the He- brew Bible, the Adam and Eve story in chapters 2 and 3 of Gene- sis. Many scholars assign this story to a source originating early in the first millennium BCE. The source has come to be known as "J" for the double reason that it deliberately introduces and makes much use of a personal name for God, "Yahweh" (which starts with a "J" in German), and that it is connected with the southern Israelite kingdom, Judah. A recent translation of J texts by David Rosenberg with commentary by Harold Bloom stresses the distinctive literary qualities of J, especially its delight in word- play and in ironies of all kinds.1 As is well known, J's version of the creation of humanity in Genesis 2 and 3 differs from the ver- sion in Genesis 1, where humanity is simply said to be created male and female. According to J, Yahweh begins by creating a single "earthling" (adam is a word for earth) from the clay of the earth. This presumably sexless being is settled in a garden, told it may eat from all trees except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and presented with all the new-made animals in hopes of finding a companion. Adam names the animals but finds no companion among them. Then Yahweh puts Adam in a deep sleep and takes out a rib and makes a woman from it. She is called "woman" (ishsha) because she was taken from a man (ish - as of this moment of sex-splitting, Adam is considered male).</page><page sequence="11">Deep Jokes 31 The woman hears the tempting words of the serpent and eats from the forbidden tree, precipitating a set of serious, basic problems in human life: shameful self-consciousness (as Adam and Eve feel compelled to cover their nakedness and to hide from Yahweh), an unpleasant role for women in the sex/gender economy, an unpleasant work experience for men, and death. The Adam and Eve story belongs to a couple of easily recog- nized types of story, first the so-called etiological myth that traces some noteworthy feature of human life back to an event that caused it, and second the fairy tale with its dreamy, magical tenor (mysterious prohibitions, deep longings and deep sleeps, talking animals). Humor is a natural ingredient in such stories since they tend to be "tall tales," flights from the everyday, involving unreal- istic yet resonant alterations of worldly things and especially tell- ing reversals, such as when the animal that talked became dumb or the dumb animal began to talk. I'll give a made-up example to illustrate the familiar form: Once upon a time, people were born knowing everything, but over the course of their lives they forgot it all, which was very danger- ous. So "schools" were founded as places where adults could be brought into regular contact with children to be reminded of things they needed to know. But the children got tired of spend- ing time with the older people and the schools declined. As a re- sult, the adults got so forgetful and inept that they didn't feed themselves well and so shriveled and shrunk. Very soon, babies had a hard time coming out of women's bodies: their heads were so squeezed that they were born knowing almost nothing instead of everything. And so it is that ever since that time, children have had to go to schools to learn whatever the adults can remember. In the genre of sex-role reversal stories, things go wrong when women take precedence, and so a reason is adduced for their real-world subordination to men.2 And yet Eve's faux pas in J's story is nothing like a power play in relation to Adam. Indeed J seems to sympathize with females while lowering the boom on them, in the language of Yahweh's curse: "In pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you" (Genesis [NRSV] 3:16). s The irony here is as sharp as the pang of childbirth. That women are fated by their own desire to subject themselves to the worst pain and danger, as well as to an everyday degradation, is a bitter pill. But wrong is right, in the manner of jokes: instead of breaking down, we break</page><page sequence="12">32 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith through; having traced out and even embellished the incongruity of the situation, we are able to hold it in focus and relish it from a mentally superior, critical perspective. J's foundational joke about human existence actually comes earlier, in the creation of Eve from Adam's rib. I've been late in perceiving this. Since the Adam and Eve story is not told as a joke in the religious culture in which I grew up, for most of my life I didn't realize that the story presents, in effect, a comically re- versed birth scene, a man bringing forth a woman. If I had won- dered about the meaning of this aspect of the story I would probably have followed the New Testament writer Paul's calm ex- planation that the sexes owe each other respect because "as wo- man [once] came from man, so man [now] comes from woman" - everything in order (1 Corinthians 11:12 [NRSV]). But since the assumed social order is patriarchal and so unacceptable, as I've come to think, my reaction to the story when I learned to see it in this light was indignant. The birth of Eve from Adam is the Big Lie, a theft of the share of women's dignity that lies in their procreative power! It was all the more amazing for me, then, to hear Bloom's suggestion that J was a woman and to see the birth of Eve in the context of J's larger tendency to portray women sympathetically. To imagine J as a pro-woman woman is to see Adam's giving birth to Eve as a particularly rich joke (though also, to be sure, a dark and dangerous one). The dawning of this perspective on J's story is an interpretive breakthrough, for it is precisely as a joke that the birth of Eve functions most credibly as an ultimate explanation. Let us be clear on the story's primary target of explanation: it is not how there came to be human beings, or how humans acquired some generic capacity like speech or reason; it is how there came to be the differentiation of sex within humanity. As for sex, the ques- tion in the foreground is not how sex functions for procreation, which isn't envisioned until the curse - at this point in the story, Yahweh is still creating all living things directly. The question is rather how sex functions for fellowship. The great challenge of explanation in this area is to try to explain sex relations in their difficulty - for we are vexed by sex. Sex isn't an innocent varying quality like hair color; sex doesn't work smoothly and reliably as a communication tool or as a means of enjoyment. The problems associated with sex are more than technical, since they are con-</page><page sequence="13">Deep Jokes 33 tinuously aroused and worsened by the desires of human agents. Further, the social and personal inequalities of sex trouble our conscience. What original weirdness could explain all this, if we assume that the basic design of humans makes basic sense for human life? What Paul presents very blandly as a symmetry in the recipro- cal dependence of men and women is originally presented byj as a great reversal. J's impish God created reproductive sex back- wards, with Eve coming out of Adam. For all we could tell in Gen- esis 2, it would be Adam, not Eve, who would function as the mother of all humans. It is Eve's disobedience - traditionally seen as the cause of all our sex troubles - that puts this side of sex right, with women having the babies. But when sex is right, it's not right. Babies bring great pain. J's joke hangs us up between two schemes, one idyllic but incredible, the other realistic but too painful to endorse. And this hang-up is precisely where we most honestly feel we are in sex relations - that's what the sex- ual relation in the broadest sense is, a shuttling between ideal and real that goes well only with some luck and some fancy foot- work. The flying power of J's joke keeps us up above these turbu- lent waters and quicksand islands. Paul has distilled the "theory" from it with his proposal about reciprocal dependence, but the theory by itself cannot secure our perspective on the subject since it is too much contradicted by the confused emotions and inequalities of real sex relations. (The emotional complexity of sex difference would also give the lie to a purely reasonable, utili- tarian approach to sex relations.) A strong deep joke cannot be overridden by experience in this way; it always asserts itself trium- phantly. We can trust it to keep us sane. Another reason the birth of Eve story is not much of an expla- nation unless it's a joke is that if it is read simply as a factual account of the creation of the first woman, it does not have a value intrinsically different from that of hundreds of other old stories of human creation, many of which could readily be adapted to fit into the book of Genesis; it is distinguished only by the fact that we do happen to find it in the canonical text. It does not enjoy special support from biology, archaeology, or any re- flective sort of theology. The only reason to believe it is conven- tional. Of course, that reason is sufficient for many devoted Jews and Christians, but in believing the story for the sake of conven-</page><page sequence="14">34 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith tion alone they get from it only a weak kind of explanatory bene- fit. The story gives them something to say on the subject of humanity's creation, if asked, and what they can say fits reasona- bly well together with the other things their tradition gives them to say. If the story is interpreted with theological ingenuity and insight, it may fit very well; it may even come to be seen as an especially important reference point in elucidating biblical faith. But the story makes this sort of contribution only accidentally. Its key attribute is that it falls in with the larger purposes of biblical editors and theologians, not that it offers a distinctive lead. If, on the other hand, one wants to say that the Adam and Eve story doesn't merely fit into a Jewish or Christian world view but forces its way in, so to speak, then one must be able to point to some impressive (or "revelatory") content in it. In what way is it impressive? Not at all in the majestic manner of Genesis 1. J's story is not about a wise and sober God who designs our world perfectly, only to see it spoiled later by a perennially growing human corruption. J's theme is rather an incalculable interaction between God and humanity (or, if you prefer, between higher and lower possibilities of humanity) . Instability is built into the relationship at the very start in at least two ways, with the prohibi- tion on eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and with the improvisational approach Yahweh takes to creating living things. Both of those elements tell us we're in for a wild ride in a scary world. Of course J the storyteller prefers a lively and unresolvable story; that makes a stronger story. So it would be misleading to imply that J sets things up in this way only to pro- vide the most helpful explanation of life as we experience it. J is a troublemaker, churning our troubled waters - but the story draws us into addressing the trouble in a position of cognitive strength. Getting the joke of J's Adam and Eve story is the intel- lectually pointed aspect of holding the trouble in view, the lame- ness of patriarchy, while holding ourselves together. Thus the story is literarily and theologically impressive in a way that stimu- lates and involves us, not in a way that settles us down in a subordinate place. The story talks about God knocking us down but actually lifts us up. (Similarly, the story I made up about schools is superficially insulting to youth, yet it implicitly empow- ers them as the source of knowledge.) * * * * *</page><page sequence="15">Deep Jokes 35 Now that I've admitted that I laugh at Parmenides's Being and J's creation of sex, I wonder who joins me in laughing, what com- munity I am in. A variety of conditions must be met for a joke to register. I, in the first place, must be able to perceive incongruity, which requires a certain degree of wit on my part together with a sufficiently permissive context. (My previous training may have made it unthinkable that I would find anything funny in a canon- ical text of metaphysics or religious narrative.) But some others besides me must enjoy the joke, too, if it's to count, even for me, as really funny; otherwise I'm "off or "twisted." Usually a joke is told, one is invited by someone else to share a perception of in- congruity along with a clever intellectual maneuver and a trium- phant attitude toward it, and so the most basic form of the social condition is taken care of from the start. Yet the sharing of a joke may be initiated and not sustained. It may be seen that the joke's main target has not been hit squarely. The energy of the joke may fizzle out, so that we fall abruptly back to earth. The attitude induced by the joke or one or more of its assumptions (for exam- ple, an ethnic or sexual stereotype) may not be tolerable. There may have been a shift in comic culture.4 A joke usually unleashes mockery of some sort - at the very least, a gentle mockery of ourselves for being vulnerable to the punch line, but often a robust mockery of its object. Parmeni- des's ball-shaped Being seems dumb. Can a community that takes metaphysical questions seriously afford to let a canonical thesis be held up as laughably dumb? Actually, in the Socratic tradition, ridicule is indispensable; nothing stimulates rational inquiry so well as a direct confrontation with the absurd entailments of thoughts. Where is there room for mockery in a religious out- look? Not, one would think, directly in a religious person's per- ception of the holy. But J's Yahweh seems impish and perverse, setting humans up for disobedience and midwifing a woman out of a man. Can a religious community accept J's story as a portrait of its object of devotion? Bloom argues that the spirit of religious seriousness will always get in the way of appreciating J's irony. He assumes (for the sake of his polemical contrast between literature and religion) that devout persons must be committed to single- minded affirmation and practical application of their articles of belief. But Bloom fails to allow for the double-mindedness that actually flourishes among the religious, their iconoclastic and</page><page sequence="16">36 SOUNDINGS Steven G. Smith ironic sense of strangeness in the human enterprise of forming a relationship with ultimate reality. He gets J's jokes but he doesn't get religion, because he doesn't see how J's jokes can be nourish- ing and even foundational in religion. We tend to feel that how to get jokes and which jokes to like are very personal matters. For one thing, we see a lot of variation in personal senses of humor; for another thing, the idea of being forced to share someone else's sense of humor is repellent. We think we live in a sort of free marketplace of jokes. In principle, you are free to choose your favorite TV shows and movies, hear the jokes you like, and incorporate them in your worldview as you see fit. However, the enormous amount of public attention given to jokes offered in this marketplace - the commentary literature on entertainment, the ratings, the consequences of the ratings, and the relentless review of this material in conversations among friends, along with a large body of jokes that circulate person to person - shows that jokes are not personal even to the degree that consumer product preferences are. It is of vital con- cern that we get each other's jokes and share jokes because jokes declare what the real, shared world is like, and they refer to the world in a fundamentally dangerous aspect. Each specific incon- gruity in a joke is like a fissure that we understand might lead to or open up into a huge crevasse. Merely to be deprived of some- thing I like, a brand of cheese perhaps, makes my life a bit duller; but not to see a joke as others see it is to lack (or at least fail to show) an ability to live in a wild world that my fellow human be- ings are stuck in. Thus we are all constantly working jointly on our jokes, just as diligently indeed as we work on what are consid- ered true explanations. Jokes are properly evaluated for morally desirable qualities like fairness and generosity. Whether a joke puts us in a world that we can decently inhabit or only in a nasty closet is the basic and most important consideration. What specifically matters in the pursuit of ultimate explana- tions, in metaphysics or creation accounts, is intellectual ade- quacy, so we must ask: Is a deep joke pertinent and heuristically fruitful in relation to all the requirements of understanding? A deep joke cannot be expected to provide a tenable theory of its subject matter, but it does make an important new disclosure of common requirements of understanding relating to the subject matter. For example, Parmenides's ball-being and Zeno's para-</page><page sequence="17">Deep Jokes 37 doxes alert us that a simple conceptual division between determi- nate existents and some sort of ether of ontological potentiality is not actually fully intelligible. J's Adam and Eve story reminds us that women are not mere auxiliaries to men and that men are not really qualified to be women's lords, so that we are forced to admit that we do not fathom the causation or the prevailing ac- ceptance of the patriarchalist gender system. We do see in both cases that there is a deep tangle - the incongruity around which the joke revolves - and we see this not in such a way that we can directly set about solving the "problem," to be sure, but neither in such a way that we gape wonderingly and powerlessly at a "mys- tery." We see the shape of the difficulty and some of its key ingre- dients; we have an intellectual purchase on it. Brute absurdities and japes trash the apparatus of explanation and so divide sub- jects from each other, but deep jokes do not. Parmenides initi- ates each generation of philosophers into the exceptional characteristics of the question of the nature of being as such. J's story warns that the human attribute and institution of gender involves a confusion before God powered by collisions of desires and of power and authenticity claims. If we heed these accounts, we will stay in touch with things we need to work on. NOTES I've benefited from good suggestions on this essay by Paula Garre tt, Darby Ray, Sandy Zale, and two anonymous readers for Soundings. 1. More recently, Richard Friedman has presented a much larger "J." 2. Compare, for example, Chapter 4 of the Kojiki, an eighth-century Japanese text in which the creator goddess Izanami gives birth to a leech-child after improperly taking the lead in courtship (191). 3. Rosenberg's translation is significantly different: "To the woman he said: 'Pain increasing, groans that spread into groans: having children will be labor. To your man's body your belly will rise, for he will be eager above you'" {The Book of J 64). 4.
