<plain_text><page sequence="1">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH: THE CASE OF R. BARUKH SCHICK by DAVID E. FISHMAN The name of Rabbi Barukh Schick of Shklov (1744-1808) does not figure in the pantheon of great eighteenth-century Jewish personalities, alongside those of R. Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, Moses Mendelssohn, and R. Elijah, the Vilna Gaon. Unlike the latter, his teachings were not distin- guished by great originality or profundity, and they exerted rather limited influence. Indeed, Schick's name might well have fallen into total oblivion were it not for a few lines in the introduction to one of his books (a Hebrew translation of Euclid's Elements), in which he related certain remarks made to him by the Vilna Gaon in support of the study of science. "I heard from his holy tongue," Schick wrote, "that for every deficiency of knowledge a man has in the sciences [h.okhmah], he will have a hundred deficiencies of knowledge in the science of the Torah; for Torah and science are closely related. And he commanded me to translate everything possible of the 95</page><page sequence="2">96 DAVID FISHMAN sciences into our holy tongue ... in order to spread knowledge among our people Israel."' These lines played a pivotal role in immortalizing the Vilna Gaon as an advocate of the sciences, and a forerunner of the Haskalah. During the nineteenth century, Russian Maskilim cited them in order to lend a rabbinic stamp of approval to their program to reform Jewish education and culture. Their educational ideal, they claimed, was not unlike that of the Vilna Gaon. Traditionalists responded by offering more restrictive interpretations of the Gaon's words to Schick. This small exegetical controversy, echoes of which can be found in modern Jewish scholarship, assured Schick a small but secure place in historical memory. He was, in some cases, depicted as R. Elijah's loyal disciple; a flattering but baseless characterization.2 The Maskilim and historians who quoted these famous lines accepted them as an accurate reproduction of R. Elijah's words. They focused their attention on interpreting their message, and neglected to take a close look at the messenger. Schick's personal odyssey was frequently ignored or glossed over. Rarely was much attention paid to the fact that he had spent a year in Berlin, in the company of Moses Mendelssohn, Naftali Hirtz Wessely, and David Friedlfinder, shortly before his audience with R. Elijah.3 Yet an awareness of this fact leads one to raise questions about Schick's motives and reliability. Did he approach R. Elijah with a hidden Maskilic agenda? Was his account of the latter's words accurate or a self-serving distortion? The entire episode-and with it, perhaps, the Vilna Gaon's attitude toward science-can only be evaluated properly in light of Schick's biography and ideology. But Schick deserves to be examined for reasons which go beyond this one celebrated incident. A person who traversed the distance between Berlin and Vilna in the late eighteenth century, and who was exposed to the intel- lectual ferments surrounding Moses Mendelssohn and the Vilna Gaon, requires close scrutiny. Until now it has usually been assumed that these two 1. Uklides (The Hague, 1780), introduction (unpaginated). 2.

Schick's story suggests that there was a level of contact between the Berlin and Vilna circles, and it may even reveal that there was a measure of intellectual traffic between them. In addition, the story of a Lithuanian rabbi who went to Berlin, saw the Haskalah circle first-hand, and then returned home somewhat changed, promises to shed light on the cultural division which was emerging at that time between Maskilim and tradi- tionalists. Schick's reaction to the Haskalah-which was neither one of total embrace nor total rejection-draws attention to the variety and complexity of modes in which traditional rabbis approached modernity. This paper will analyze Schick's encounter with the Mendelssohnian circle in Berlin, and assess its impact-on Schick, and secondarily, on the Berliners. The best way to go about such an assessment (in the absence of extensive memoirs and retrospective statements by the protagonists them- selves) is a before-and-after approach. How did Schick's thinking on science differ before and after his stay in Berlin? Conversely, how did the Berlin circle's thinking about Polish Jews differ before and after Schick's visit? Such an approach may, of course, suffer from the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy. It is always difficult to prove direct causation. I believe, however, that there is a sufficient body of evidence to support the contention that this encounter precipitated certain discernible changes in Schick's mind, and, to a lesser extent, in the Berliners'. Toward the end of the paper, I will suggest that Schick's reaction to the Berlin Haskalah is in a sense paradigmatic of a type of reaction by East European traditionalist rabbis to the Haskalah. I Barukh Schick was born in 1744, in the east Belorussian city of Shklov, which, much like the Galician Brody, emerged as a burgeoning Jewish center during the eighteenth century. Schick was born into a distinguished family belonging to Belorussia's rabbinic elite. His father, R. Jacob, served as Shklov's communal rabbi for some twenty years, and was, according to contemporaries, a respected talmudist and halakhic authority. Schick's uncle on his mother's side was the noted R. Arye Leyb Ginzburg, the Sha'agat Arye, widely viewed as the most outstanding halakhist (alongside the Vilna Gaon) in eighteenth-century Poland. In a society where social status was closely connected with family pedigree, Schick's relation to the</page><page sequence="4">98 DAVID FISHMAN Sha'agat Arye was of particular importance. The Ginzburg family was, in addition, the predominant force in the Belorussian rabbinate, with members of this family holding the office of provincial rabbi for "Medinat Rusiya," and communal rabbi in several local towns.4 What we know of Schick's youth seems to indicate a young man follow- ing in the footsteps of his family. He studied the Talmud under his father's tutelage, then moved to Minsk, the capital of Belorussia, in 1760, joined the exclusive hevra "Shivah Keruim" (open only to scholars and communal leaders), and began to rise up its ranks. In 1764, Schick was granted semikha by R. Avrohom Katzenelenbogen of Brest-Litovsk (Brisk), and eventually assumed the positions of parnas and dayyan in the Minsk community.5 One has here what appears to be a typical biography of a scholar rising up the ladder of rabbinic and communal leadership, thanks to his learning, kinship ties, and connections. But there is one feature of Schick's early life which appears to be atypical for someone of his rabbinic background and Polish-Lithuanian milieu, i.e., his study of certain scientific disciplines, and his involvement in composing Hebrew books of science. According to Schick's own accounts, these activi- ties began during his years in Shklov and Minsk. In the introduction to his first book, he reminisced: "I said I shall be wise," and I prepared my books of science. "But it was far from me," for when I composed two or three pages, the city burnt down, and all my books and tools were destroyed. Later on, I had a bit of prosperity, and I continued to collect "words of understanding and wisdom of the times." When the burden of sustenance fell upon me, I in my anguish arranged the little that I had of scientific books and decided to elucidate that which a man needs to know regarding himself, his body, and composition.6 4.

After he began to compose a work of science, his books were devoured in a local fire-an allusion to the great Minsk blaze of 1762, which destroyed the local Beth Midrash, the synagogue of the "Shivah Keruim" society, and other build- ings in the Jewish quarter.7 Shortly after returning to his scientific work, he was married and assumed the burden of supporting a family, an event we can safely venture took place during his Minsk years, when Schick was in his late teens and twenties. Despite these obstacles, Schick recalls, he was able to compose his first work, devoted to human anatomy and physiology, which he published in Berlin in 1777 under the title Tiferet Adam. In a second brief recollection, written during his stay in Berlin, Schick dated his involvement in science to an even earlier stage of his life-his youthful years in Shklov. When I was still in the home of my father, the famous rabbi and scholar, and we used to study together the Talmud with Rashi, Tosafot, and codes day and night, my soul longed to lift up the crown of Israel, and to translate books into the Hebrew language on every discipline and science. But the vicissitudes of time overtook me, and these thoughts of mine came to an end..,. due to my dislocation from one home to another, and from one city to another.8 Here again, the account alludes to a verifiable event in Schick's life-his relocation from Shklov to Minsk. One may, of course, wonder whether it was not self-serving on Schick's part, sitting in Berlin, to claim that his devotion to the sciences went back to his earliest youth. Moreover, it seems unlikely, to say the least, that the son of a Polish rabbi living in Shklov would, at age sixteen or less, conceive of the unprecedented project of translating books on all disciplines and sciences into Hebrew. One suspects that Schick was projecting his current designs back into his childhood. Nonetheless, despite these misgivings about Schick's second testimony, it points in the same general direction as the first one, indicating that his scientific studies began in Belorussia, long before Berlin. This claim is corroborated by the testimony of R. Saul Levin that Schick "came here from the land of Lithuania with a scroll on the santifica- tion of the moon and anatomy."9 7.

Anatomy was, of course, an essential part of medical education, and had attracted the interest of numerous rabbi-physicians, ever since the days of Shabbetai Donello and Maimonides. In addition to its practical application in the medical profession, anatomy was viewed by rabbis who were themselves physicians as a valuable tool for instilling an awareness of God in one's consciousness. The human body was God's greatest creation, and examination of it served to strengthen one's religious sensibility, argued Donello, Joseph Ibn Aknin, Meir Aldabi, and numerous others. They invariably cited Job 19:26, "from my flesh I behold God," as the proof-text for this viewpoint.'0 The tradition of astronomical study among rabbis was just as strong. Calculating the exact time of the lunar phasis, which marked the beginning of the new Hebrew month, was considered by many to constitute fulfillment of the biblical commandment to "sanctify the moon." Ever since Maimoni- des' epoch-making treatise on the subject, Hilkhot Kiddush ha-.Iodesh, scores of rabbis had studied the relevant mathematical and astronomical calculations, in order to determine the moment of the new moon's "birth." Lunar astronomy was thus regarded as a legitimate specialty in the field of halakhah, and generated a small library of rabbinic works and commen- taries." Both these traditions were inactive in eighteenth-century Poland. Lunar astronomy-a popular discipline among Polish rabbis in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries-fell into general disuse after the great deluge of 1648-1657; human anatomy thrived among Italian rabbi-physicians for a lengthy period of time, but was never popular among Polish rabbis, who rarely complemented their rabbinic studies with a medical education.'2 Schick's originality lay in his turning to these spheres of inquiry, which were dormant in his time and place. Dormant, but not delegitimized. Medicine was a respected and honored profession among Polish Jews in the eighteenth century, with several of the finest and brightest young men journeying to Padua or Frankfurt to obtain 10.

The Spanish-Italian tradition of rabbi-physicians was imbedded in history and viewed with distant respect. The attitude toward astronomy was more immediate; it was still considered to be a discipline which was sanctioned by the rabbinic tradition. In theory, if rarely in prac- tice, it remained a legitimate intellectual option. One can point to a few rabbinic practitioners of astronomy/mathematics in eighteenth-century Poland-R. Solomon of Chelma, R. Israel of Zamosc, R. Jonathan of Ruzhany, and the Vilna Gaon himself.1" Schick's study of these disciplines -particularly of anatomy-was not commonplace for his day and age, but there was nothing deviant or rebellious in it. It evidently did not hinder his rise to positions of prominence, such as dayyan and parnas in the Minsk Jewish community. A perusal of Schick's early works provides an interesting glimpse of his scientific workshop and thinking before his exposure to the West. On the whole, these works follow in the tradition of medieval rabbinic science- their content is essentially premodern, they cite rabbinic literature as a source of scientific wisdom, and they are prefaced by religious rationales for the study of their respective disciplines. But within these traditional para- meters, there are some novel and surprising features worthy of note. 1. Schick's early science was medieval. His anatomy followed Galen, apparently oblivious to Harvey's discoveries on the heart and blood- circulation, which revolutionized the study of the human body. His astro- nomy was Ptolemaic, without so much as an allusion to the Copernican theory of a heliocentric planetary system. In their naivet6 regarding scienti- fic developments which had occurred more than 150 years earlier, Schick's works were truly a throwback to the Middle Ages. A number of his pre- decessors in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries had displayed a keen awareness (if not an enthusiastic embrace) of the theories of Harvey and Copernicus.14 One cannot ascribe Schick's scientific backwardness to an ignorance of Latin on his part. Surprisingly, and inexplicably, Schick knew Latin and 13.

In the course of his anatomy, he cited the work of Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576), a professor of medicine at Pavia University, and in his astronomy he referred to Frangois Vi&amp;te's (1540-1603) Canon Mathematicus and Euclid's Elements.'5 In fact, Schick prided himself on his Latin scholarship, and, in his preface, took to task earlier Hebrew authors on astronomy who "lacked the necessary learning from books in foreign tongues, such as Euclid and others." (This was indeed an apt critique of the rabbinic astronomy practiced in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Poland, whose luminaries drew their knowledge exclu- sively from medieval Hebrew writings and translations.)'6 Linguistically, Schick was up to the task of obtaining a correct picture of the state of knowledge in these fields. If Schick's science was severely anti- quated, this was due to his remoteness from the centers of European science. Schick based his knowledge upon the few Latin writings which reached him in Belorussia, and the latter were, it seems, hopelessly outdated. One can only speculate as to how Latin manuscripts reached Schick's hands. A number of young Lithuanian Jews traveled to Padua, Italy, to pursue a medical education, and it is likely that they brought scientific writings back to Lithuania after their course of study.'7 One such medical student, Yekutiel Gordon of Vilna (known for his membership in the mystical-messianic circle of R. Moshe Haim Luzzatto), resided in Shklov during the 1730s and 1740s, and practiced medicine there. He may well have been the conduit through which the writings of Cardano, Vidte, and Euclid reached Shklov.'8 In a few instances, Schick's scientific information was surprisingly advanced. He was aware of the invention of the microscope and its use in biological research (begun by Malpighi in 1660), and he knew of the dis- 15.

It is difficult to comprehend why Schick singled out Isaac Israeli's Yesod Olam and Joseph Shlomo Delmedigo's Elim for criticism on account of their ignorance of "books in foreign tongues, such as Euclid." Both were replete with references to Euclid and other Greek scientists. 17. N. M.

In keeping with the tradition of rabbinic science, Schick employed the works of classical rabbinic literature as sources of scientific wisdom. His astronomy relied heavily upon Maimonides' Hilkhot Kiddush ha-Hodesh, and his anatomy invoked the Bible, Talmud, and Zohar as authorities.20 The utilization of the Zohar in this manner was an innovation on Schick's part and deserves some explication. A recurring theme in the Zohar and medieval kabbalistic literature is the notion that the Divine sefirot correspond-in one sense or another-to the limbs of the human body. It was commonplace for the Zohar to refer to different sefirot in anthropomorphic terms, as the supernal brain, eyes, liver, and so forth. The sefirotic realm itself was frequently referred to as Adam Elyon, "supernal man." Most post-zoharic kabbalists, rejecting as they did the anthropomorphic conception of God, were eager to stress that the correspondence between the human limbs and the sefirot was purely symbolic. But however allegorized or minimized, the idea of correspondence between the "supernal image" and the human image was part and parcel of the kabbalistic tradition.21 This doctrine allowed Schick to employ the anthropomorphic sections of the Zohar as reliable statements of human anatomy; indeed as the most reliable statements of all, since the Zohar was traditionally viewed as the product of Divine revelation to R. Shimon bar Yoblai. Consequently, his discussion of the lungs quoted an excerpt from the Raya Mehemna which dealt, in symbolic language, with the sefirot of Hesed and Din; his discussion of the kidneys cited a passage from Tikune Zohar elucidating the relation between Netzah and Hod; he derived information on the structure of the brain from the Zohar's discussion of Keter, and so on.22 In doing so, Schick did not empty these passages of their theosophic meaning; on the contrary, 19.

Schick's adherence to the Zohar, and more generally to Kabbalah, also came to the fore in his apologia for the study of anatomy. Besides invoking the time-honored rationale that study of the human body height- ened one's awareness and reverence of God, he adduced a kabbalistic argument as well, based on the very same zoharic doctrine of the "supernal image." Anatomy, he claimed, was key to apprehending the mystery of God himself. (This involved a new twist in the usage of Job 19:26.) Within [man] are bound and hidden the clues to the mystery of God, as it is written, "from my flesh I behold God."24 [God] created man in His likeness and image, so that [man] might attain from his very self the mysteries and knowledge of the Creator, as it is written, "from my flesh I behold God." We have therefore undertaken to explain man's structure and composition, and the composition of his limbs, so that the initiated [ha-maskil] may delve into their hidden meaning, which is concealed and spiritual.25 Here Schick employed the doctrine of the supernal image in the opposite direction as beforehand. If each sefirah was analogous to a human limb, then study of the human body could provide the initiated kabbalist with valuable insights concerning the sefirot. He would able to translate his knowledge of anatomy into Kabbalah, and read the Zohar's anthropo- morphic sections with deeper mystical understanding. "Each and every organ intimates a deep mystery," Schick claimed; hence the need for the comprehensive study of anatomy.26 This line of argumentation was not totally new. Schick drew much of it from R. Moshe Haim Luzzatto (Ramhal), the great Italian kabbalist, ethicist, and author. Luzzatto had expounded upon the theme of the "mystery of the body" in the introduction to his commentary on Idra Rabba. Invoking Job 19:26, and citing the Zohar's statement that man should "know himself, who he is, and how his body has been arranged," 23. Tiferet Adam, p. 17a, citing Zohar III 235a. Y. S. Reggio, an enlightened Italian rabbi, criticized Schick for his utilization of the Zohar for anatomical data, Otzar Nehmad 1 (Vienna, 1856): 9. 24. Tiferet Adam, p. la. 25. Ibid., p. 2a. 26. Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH 105 Luzzatto had concluded that "There are things which one should under- stand concerning the sefirot by virtue of man."27 It was left to Schick to take this argument to its logical conclusion, and claim that a systematic exposi- tion of human anatomy was of theosophic import. Schick referred in passing to "the manuscript commentary on the Idra by Rabbi Haim Luzzatto," and it is clear that his rationale for anatomy was indebted to the latter. This is noteworthy, since Luzzatto's work on the Idra Rabba was unpublished at the time, and manuscripts of the latter's works were copied and disseminated in Eastern Europe by none other than Yekutiel Gordon, the former Padua medical student who resided in Shklov in the 1740s. Our discovery of Ramhalian influence on Schick leads us to Gordon as intermediary. This lends strength to our earlier suggestion that Gordon was the courier who brought Latin scientific manuscripts to Shklov.28 Schick's kabbalistic rationale for anatomy is noteworthy for substantive reasons as well. It is a vivid illustration of the fact that Kabbalah and science were not necessarily polar opposites in traditional Jewish thought; preoccu- pation with the one did not preclude acceptance and study of the other. Rabbinic minds such as those of Schick and the young Solomon Maimon (not to mention the Vilna Gaon) constructed intellectual modi vivendi in which Kabbalah and science were harmonious, complementary, and in Schick's case, even reinforced each other. The student of science was not by definition a rationalist. While Schick's study of science was atypical for his milieu, his allegiance to Kabbalah indicates the extent to which he shared the traditional modes of thinking of his time. Kabbalah dominated Jewish religious thought in eighteenth-century Eastern Europe,29 and Schick, a product of its rabbinic elite, was no exception. His originality notwithstanding, Schick's thinking was very much that of an eighteenth-century Polish rabbi. More generally, the basic contours of his early works were set by the rabbinic tradition of science: his interest was confined to areas with strong rabbinic traditions of study, and he rationalized the study of these disciplines in terms of their advancing traditional religious values-whether the elucidation of Hilkhot Kiddush ha-.Iodesh or the enhancement of one's mystical knowledge. There is no merit in viewing Schick in his pre-Berlin years as a forerunner of enlightenment. 27. Moshe Haim Luzzatto, Adir Ba-Marom, ed. S. Luria (Warsaw, 1880), pp. 2a-b. 28.

He next surfaced in Berlin in late 1776. The intervening years are a mystery.30 Schick's journeying westward and his residence in Berlin were in them- selves nothing out of the ordinary. During the second half of the eighteenth century, thousands of Polish Jews migrated westward, to Prussia and the other German states, as a result of the political and economic disarray in which Poland found itself. Although entry into Berlin was restricted and somewhat difficult, some Polish Jewish peddlers, melamdim, and wealthy merchants made their way through the city's gates. In addition, there were those scholars and intellectuals who came to Berlin and became part of the circle of enlightened Jews surrounding Moses Mendelssohn. These included Isaac Satanov and Solomon Dubno in the 1770s, and Solomon Maimon and Menahem Mendl Lefin in the 1780s.31 One is tempted to add Schick's name to this list of 6migr~s turned Maskilim, but there are several respects in which Schick differed from the latter. Firstly, Schick was not an immigrant at all. He journeyed westward for the limited purpose of collecting advance subscribers for his scientific writings, in order to finance their publication. (This was a common practice among Polish rabbis at the time, due to the economic crisis in Poland.)32 After obtaining subscribers in a number of Polish and German towns (Zlotowo, Lissa, Schwerin), Schick had the good fortune of encountering the Jewish community of Berlin, which was singularly supportive of his literary ventures. But he was no more than a visitor in their midst: his stay there lasted less than a year, and he returned to Poland after successfully publishing his books. Secondly, Schick did not come to Berlin in search of truth and wisdom, 30. Shabad, Toldot Ha- Yamim, p. 16. According to Mahler, Divre Yeme Yisrael, vol. 1, pt. 4, pp. 53-54, Schick journeyed first to London, studied medicine there, and visited Berlin en route back to Poland. I have found no evidence to support any of these claims. R. Saul Berlin in his letter of approbation to Amude Ha-Shamayim-Tiferet Adam states that Schick "came here from the land of Lithuania with a scroll on kiddush ha-hodesh and anatomy." 31. M. A.

And unlike the other Polish Jews who came into contact with the Mendelssohnian circle, he was a bona fide member of the Polish rabbinic elite-an ordained rabbi, a dayyan, and the scion of a prestigious rabbinic family. All these factors impinged upon the relations between Schick and the Berlin circle during his stay there. They also provide a context for under- standing why Schick's Berlin experience had a moderate rather than a revolutionary impact upon him. His first contact appears to have been with the rabbi of the Berlin Jewish community, R. Hirschl Levin, and the latter's son R. Shaul, then rabbi of the neighboring Frankfurt on the Oder. Both father and son greeted this Polish rabbinic scientist warmly, and composed letters of approbation for his first book, Amude Ha-Shamayim-Tiferet Adam, which consisted of Schick's early works on astronomy and anatomy. R. Hirschl encouraged Schick to continue publishing scientific treatises, and assisted him in ini- tiating his second literary venture-the preparation of a printed edition of Isaac Israeli's Yesod Olam, a classic of medieval Hebrew astronomy-by sharing two rare manuscripts of the work from his private collection. It is also likely that R. Hirschl introduced Schick to the notables of the Berlin Jewish community, including the circle of enlightened Jews surrounding Moses Mendelssohn.33 By 1777, the Mendelssohnian circle was firmly established. Marcus Hertz, David Friedlinder, Isaac Satanov, Solomon Dubno, and Naftali Hirtz Wessely had all settled or resettled in Berlin by the time of Schick's arrival. They, along with several others, constituted a well-defined and distinct social circle, which met frequently in Mendelssohn's home. More- over, they had by then developed their distinctive outlook on the need to introduce reforms in Jewish culture and society. In 1777, Mendelssohn and Dubno were at work on the Biur, a project which undertook to spread knowledge of "pure German" among Jews, and to instill in them an aesthe- tic appreciation of the Bible. David Friedlhnder was in the midst of organiz- ing the Freischule, a school which would combine secular disciplines and European languages with a Jewish religious curriculum. Schick encountered the circle during the heady early days of its efflorescence, and, one should 33.

A group ofparnasim and prominent citizens became his patrons, and hired him to tutor their sons in mathematics. They and the Mendelssohnian circle rallied around Schick's project to publish Yesod Olam, and provided him with the material support to do so. In just over a month's time, Schick had the necessary funds to publish a volume which was a work of typographic craftsmanship-with four different typefaces on the title page, diagrams within the body of the text, clear printing, and durable paper. This magnificent edition could only have been made possible thanks to considerable financial resources.35 The list of advance subscribers to the volume, published on its second page, was virtually a who's who of the Berlin Jewish community. It included Moses Mendelssohn himself, Daniel Itzig (then head of the community), four of Itzig's sons, including Isaac Daniel Itzig (soon to be co-director of the Freischule), David Friedlinder (who purchased five copies-for himself and his four brothers in Koenigsburg), R. Shaul Levin (whose name was placed at the head of the list of subscribers), and eight parnasim of the Berlin community. R. Hirschl Levin provided a warm letter of approbation, which was endorsed by the full rabbinic courts of Berlin and Frankfurt on the Oder. Finally, Naftali Hirtz Wessely, the poet laureate of the Mendels- sohnian circle, contributed a special poem in praise of Schick and his enter- prise.36 It is clear that the Mendelssohnian circle viewed the publication of Yesod Olam as an important literary event. It was, in fact, the very first publishing venture they entered into as a group. Why so much fanfare and enthusiasm for the work of a virtual stranger, a passing visitor? What great attraction was there in Yesod Olam-a book of Ptolemaic astronomy-that its publica- tion should be transformed into a sort of public cultural manifestation? To a certain extent, the commotion surrounding Schick may have been due to condescending curiosity on the Berliners' part. The sight of an 34. On the Mendelssohnian circle, see A.

By contrast, Amude Ha-Shamayim-Tiferet Adam, published shortly after Schick's arrival, was a simple, low-cost publication. It appears that Schick had not yet made the acquaintance of Berlin's elite at the time of its printing. 36.

(They would be similarly surprised by Solomon Maimon's incisive philo- sophic thinking when the latter arrived in Berlin a few years later.) Schick, and later Maimon, did not fit their image of Ost-Juden as "ignorant of languages, dignified behavior and matters of science," an image based large- ly upon the peddlers and melamdim whom they saw in their midst. A Polish Jew who wrote books of astronomy and mathematics was cause for amaze- ment. Surely such a person deserved their charitable assistance.37 But the organized and public show of support for Schick's edition of Yesod Olam was unquestionably much more than an expression of paternal- istic benevolence. It is safe to conclude that the Berliners took Schick under their wing because they saw great promise in him as an agent of positive change among the Jews of Poland. Schick intended to return to Poland and distribute his books there, and the Berliners hoped that he would be able to generate interest in science among Polish Jews, particularly among scholars and talmudists. As a rabbi, dayyan, and scion of a great rabbinic family, he was in a unique position, they hoped, to introduce scientific studies into the rabbinic curriculum. (The Berlin edition of Yesod Olam drew attention to Schick's rabbinic credentials by printing the text of his writ of ordination.) This would be an important step forward, and could pave the way for a broadeFand more general reform of Polish Jewry. If talmudists began to study science, then the spirit of science and reason might eventually spread beyond the rabbinic curriculum into other spheres of life, or so they reasoned. This reconstruction of the Berliners' thinking is admittedly speculative. But it is the most plausible explanation for the outpouring of support which Schick's Yesod Olam project elicited from the enlightened Jews of the city. The hopes which the latter placed on Schick were expressed in Wessely's laudatory poem to him, which read, in part: Arise Barukh, and plow through your land, Cause fruits to blossom from your garden of reason, 37. On the Berliners' attitude toward Polish Jews, see N. H. Wessely, Divre Shalom Ve-Emet (Berlin, 1782), pp. 55-56; Aaron Halle Wolfsohn, "Siha Be-Eretz Ha-Hayim," Ha-Measef 7 (1797): 55.

The fortresses of the magnates shall not stand forever, In due time their iron bolts shall be broken, Your shield of wisdom is eternal, your fruit everlasting, You and your supporters will not expire. Woe unto the fools who chase after nothingness, The man of reason is in their eyes a misleader, Blessed is the man who hearkens to instruction, Who is a friend of the wise and a companion of the knowledgeable.38 To suggest that the Mendelssohnian circle embraced Schick as someone who could begin the process of reforming Polish Jewish culture does not mean, of course, that Schick's own goals were identical to theirs. Schick's "agenda," if one can call it that, was restricted to science; theirs was much broader, including reforms in the spheres of language, dress, manners and morality, economic activity, and ultimately, social rapprochement with enlightened Gentiles and political emancipation. Schick's frame of reference was squarely that of the rabbinic tradition (in the introduction to Yesod Olam, his central point was that the mathematical sciences were indispensa- ble for understanding various commandments of the Torah); the Berliners' frame of reference was largely that of the European Enlightenment. But their differing goals and outlooks did converge at this one point of science, and the Berlin circle was eager to support any project that would expand Jews' intellectual horizons beyond the conventional parameters of the day. Both Schick and the Berliners could not help but be aware of the differ- ences between them. The Berliners must have found him sorely lacking in a number of areas. His range of interests was too narrow, since he was appar- ently indifferent to philosophy, aesthetics, and the humanities; he lacked fluency in German and probably could not read German literature. In their terms, Schick could hardly have been considered a man of culture. This evaluation is precisely the one which emerges from a passage in Wessely's Divre Shalom Ve-Emet, written five years after Schick's visit. Wessely's description of Polish rabbinic scientists who visited Berlin matches Schick to a tee. It is quoted here in full. We have seen among our Polish brethren who have come to this city great 38. Yesod Olam, pp. 2a-b.</page><page sequence="17">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH 111 Torah scholars, who studied geometry and astronomy in their homeland by themselves, without the aid of a teacher. They knew the depths of these sciences, to such an extent that Gentile scholars marveled at their reaching such a level of knowledge without a teacher. They studied the few books which were written by scholars of our nation, such as Yesod Olam by Isaac Israeli and Elim by Yosef Kandiah. If these people had mastered one of the foreign languages, they would have learned much more in less time, because of the many books written on these sciences by Gentile scholars, in an orderly fashion and a pure language understandable to beginners. The books which they studied, however, were not written for beginners, and are not written in an orderly fashion. They also did not know anything of the natural sciences. since nothing is written about them in Hebrew. Needless to say, they did not know geography and history, even though the latter are much easier than the deep sciences which they studied, because there are no Hebrew books to study about them. Even in those sciences which they mastered, they could not organize their words and communicate well to others, because of their stutter- ing language. From all of this we see what a great misfortune it is if the youths do not study one of the foreign languages grammatically, such that they can speak it clearly, and can read any book or letter written in it. Wessely's reference to Yesod Olam leaves little doubt that he had Schick in mind when composing this portrait of Polish rabbinic scientists. The upshot of Wessely's remarks was to stress the indispensability of fluency in a modern European language (actually German) in order to become educated and cultured. He cited Schick as a negative example of someone whose scope of knowledge was extremely narrow, and who was unable to commu- nicate his knowledge logically and effectively because of his lack of fluency in German. Schick was hardly a model of the new type of Jew the Berlin Maskilim envisioned. But despite their ideological and cultural differences, Schick and the Berliners found it useful, for their own separate purposes, to ally themselves with each other. Schick was able to publish his books, and the Berliners were able to gain a modest foothold in Eastern Europe for their program of cultural reform. They did not share the same worldview or outlook. But they did share a common interest in disseminating scientific knowledge among the Jews, and they were able to collaborate on that basis. That common interest did, in fact, set both Schick and the Berliners apart from the Ashkenazic Jewish culture of their time. 39. N. H. Wessely, Divre Shalom Ve-Emet (Berlin, 1782), pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="18">112 DAVID FISHMAN Schick left Berlin for Poland in the fall of 1777. But before we move on to assess the impact which his Berlin experience had upon him, it is worth- while to pause and consider the converse as well. What impact, if any, did his visit have on the Mendelssohnian circle? Clearly, the visit must have been a memorable event that left a lasting impression if Wessely referred to it years later in Divre Shalom Ve-Emet. But did it have any concrete effect on the Berliners' thinking and activity? With the aid of hindsight, one can say that Schick's visit aroused a lasting interest among members of the Mendelssohnian circle in the problem of reforming Polish Jewry. Their exposure to Schick, with his unique mix- ture of progressiveness and backwardness, heightened their awareness of the opportunities and difficulties involved in altering the complexion of the vast Jewry to the east. The topic remained in their consciousness after Schick's departure, and in subsequent years they devised publication projects which were specifically designed to advance Polish Jewry's reform. To a greater or lesser extent, these publications were modeled after Yesod Olam. In 1784, Mendelssohn, Friedlinder, and a group of enlightened Jews hired Solomon Maimon to translate works into Hebrew "in order," as Maimon recalls in his autobiography, "to enlighten the Polish Jews still living in darkness." The group considered various proposals of books which would further this goal, ranging from Basnage's History of the Jews to Reimarus' Natural Religion, but finally agreed on composing a mathematics text in Hebrew, based on the Latin writings of Wolff. Maimon records with some bitterness that after he had spent several months composing his trans- lation, the group withdrew its financial commitment to the volume, claiming that it was too expensive and unprofitable.40 Five years later, in 1789, the Berlin Freischule press also managed to bring a similar project to fruition. It published Menahem Mendl Lefin's Modah Le-Binah, a volume consisting of letters on the natural sciences and a discourse on health translated from a popular medical manual. Lefin, a native of Podolia, undertook the project during his stay in Berlin (1780-1783), at the suggestion of Mendelssohn, who intended it for "our brethren the children of Israel in the land of Poland." Mendelssohn com- posed a fund-raising letter for the volume in 1785 (shortly before his death) in which he stressed the need for Hebrew discourses on medicine "in 40. Maimon, Autobiography, pp. 134-137. The original German provides the initials of the persons involved. These were Dr. B. and Messrs.

In their choice of subject matter, these projects followed in the footsteps of Yesod Olam. The tactical decision to begin with Hebrew books of math and science was in all likeli- hood the legacy of Schick's visit in their midst. III There is no need, in the context of this paper, to follow Schick's bio- graphy in its entirety from 1778 until his death in 1808. Since our focus here is on the impact of his Berlin experience, we will restrict our discussion to the few years immediately afterwards, which marked the height of Schick's activity and productivity. During this time he published three books: Derekh Yeshara (The Hague, 1779), a manual of preventative medicine, Uklides (The Hague, 1780), a translation of Books I through VI of Euclid's Elements, and Keneh Ha-Midah (Prague, 1783), a translation of a British work on algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Schick spent these years residing in Minsk, although he did venture westward, to Prague, in 1783.42 A perusal of these writings reveals that Schick was not converted into a Maskil-in any meaningful sense of the term-by the year which he spent in Berlin. He did not come to espouse Haskalah positions or the need to alter Jewish language, manners, moral behavior, economic activity, social rela- tions, or even, as we shall see, elementary schooling. Indeed he remained 41. See the partial reprint of Modah Le-Binah under the title Refuot He'am (Zolkiew, 1794), title page and verso; Jospeh Klausner, Historyah Shel Ha-Sifrut Ha-Ivrit Ha-Hadasha (Jerusalem, 1960), vol. 1, pp. 225-226. 42. Schick spent his later years in Minsk (to 1791), in Ustye, a private estate in the Mogilev province of tsarist Russia (to roughly 1797), and Slutsk, where he died in 1808. He published but one book during this span of time, a second edition of Keneh Ha-Midah (Shklov, 1791). His most surprising act was his becoming a member, in 1785, of the Vienna chapter of the Order of the Asiatic Brethren, a pseudo-Masonic organization whose members included Austrian aristocrats and Jewish Frankists. Despite this unusual association, about which very little is known, there is no basis for doubting Schick's religious orthodoxy in the 1780s and 1790s. See G. Scholem, "Karyerah Shel Frankist: Moshe Dobrushka Ve-Gilgulav," Mehkarim Ve-Mekorot Le-Toldot Ha-Shabtaut Ve-Gilguleha (Jerusalem, 1974), esp. pp. 160-163.</page><page sequence="20">114 DAVID FISHMAN profoundly indifferent to these concerns, which formed the matrix of Haskalah ideology. Schick's sphere of interest continued to be limited to science, and primarily to mathematics. But this is not to say that he remained completely unchanged by his Berlin experience-his activity was transformed and intensified, and his mode of thinking underwent certain changes. We now turn to consider these new developments. Before Berlin, Schick was an isolated practitioner of rabbinic science; afterwards he was an active crusader for the dissemination of scientific wisdom. He was now imbued with an urgent sense of mission that contri- buted toward his prolific output during these years. In addition to his pub- lished works, he completed and announced for publication three volumes- the concluding half of Uklides, a treatise on triangles, and a collection of medical remedies-whose appearance in print were prevented by a lack of funds.43 Schick was now driven by some sort of compulsion. Much as the Berliners had hoped, he was engaged in a one-man literary campaign to spread scientific knowledge among his coreligionists in Poland. This intensified literary activity was complemented by an aggressive pursuit of supporters and allies among the great rabbinic authorities of the day. One of Schick's first steps after returning to Poland was to meet with the Vilna Gaon-a meeting which took place in February 1778, roughly six months after the publication of Yesod Olam in Berlin. It is likely that Schick hoped to obtain a haskamah from the Gaon for one of his books, perhaps even a public statement on behalf of the study of science. The latter would have been the most effective means by which to gain the attention of rab- binic scholars throughout Lithuania and beyond. If so, Schick was to be disappointed by the outcome of their meeting. R. Elijah did not issue a haskamah or public pronouncement (in his lifetime, R. Elijah gave all of three letters of approbation), although he did express some general words of encouragement, which Schick eagerly publicized in his introduction to Uklides44. Four years later, in 1783, Schick journeyed to Prague with a similar intention-to enlist the support of its chief rabbi, R. Ezekiel Landau, who was second only to the Vilna Gaon in his standing as a rabbinic authority. There Schick published Keneh Ha-Midah, along with Landau's haskamah, which was remarkably brief for Landau (all of ten lines), and which praised 43.

Uklides, introduction; I intend to deal with the encounter between Schick and the Vilna Gaon separately.</page><page sequence="21">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH 115 the book in rather guarded language.45 Once again Schick had journeyed a considerable distance in order to obtain the support of a rabbinic luminary, only to receive a favorable, but less than enthusiastic, response. While in Prague, Schick conducted mathematics classes for a group of adult students, and enlisted the financial support of several prominent citi- zens of the Jewish community, most notably the members of the Jeitteles family.46 What transformed Schick from a cloistered scholar of the sciences to an activist on behalf of their dissemination? The answer appears to lie in a new development in Schick's thinking which may be attributed to his stay in Berlin; namely, his deep distress and concern about the Jews' inferiority in the sphere of scientific learning. The topic of Jewish inferiority, absent from Schick's early works, was first mentioned in his introduction to Yesod Olam and assumed greater prominence in his post-Berlin writings. Schick claimed in the introductions to Uklides and Keneh Ha-Midah that the Jews' ignorance of science had led to their being mocked and derided by Gentiles. In Uklides, he lashed out at unnamed "enemies of wisdom" and claimed that the latter had brought great harm to the public image of the Jews. They are the ones who have caused the children of Israel to sin against the sciences, and have stricken them with the plague of blindness. They have thereby made [the children of Israel] a mockery and disgrace in the eyes of the nations.47 A few lines later he returned to the topic a second time. The name of heaven is disgraced among the Gentiles, who abuse us by saying that we are a foolish nation, not a wise one.48 Toward the end of the introduction, Schick asserted that Jewish honor could be restored by disseminating scientific wisdom among rabbinic scholars. He now professed that this was in fact his chief intention in pub- lishing Hebrew books of science such as Uklides. His professed goal was 45. Keneh Ha-Midah (Prague, 1783), verso. 46. Ibid.

The topic of Gentile mockery is raised three separate times in the course of the introduction to Uklides, clearly more than one would expect for the utilization of a standard rabbinic theme, and the same "standard theme" is totally absent from Schick's rationales for scientific study in his pre-Berlin works. The claim of Gentile mockery should be taken seriously, as a matter of deep concern to Schick. Moreover, we know from Wessely's account in Divre Shalom Ve-Emet that Schick did indeed meet with German scientific scholars, who "marveled at [his] having reached such a level of knowledge without a teacher." It is likely that this "marveling" at Schick's geometry and mathematics was coupled with a heavy dosage of condescension and amusement at his antediluvian knowledge of astronomy and anatomy. If so, then Schick may well have experienced "the mockery of the Gentiles" first hand! In any event, it was certainly a topic he heard much about from the Berlin Maskilim, who were exceedingly sensitive about the subject of the Jews' ignorance of science and other branches of modern culture. Schick's phrases regarding "the mockery of the Gentiles" reflect (in stereotypical language) the personal distress which he experienced in Berlin upon his discovery that he and his coreligionists were considered to be ignorant and backward in many spheres of knowledge. This must have come as a jolting realization for Schick. In eighteenth- century Eastern Europe, Jews lived predominantly among a peasant population and were, on the whole, more culturally advanced than their Gentile neighbors. When it came to literacy and mathematical ability, Jews in Shklov or Minsk were heads above the local townsmen or peasants. But in Berlin, Schick, who had devoted years of study to the sciences, was considered backward and ignorant. This was a case of acute culture shock. For Schick, the intellectual inferiority of Jews, and specifically of rabbis 49. Ibid. The position of this sentence is ambiguous; it may be read as a continuation of the words of the Vilna Gaon which precede it, or, alternatively, as Schick's own words. I am con- vinced that the sentiment is Schick's and is totally uncharacteristic of R. Elijah.</page><page sequence="23">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH 117 such as himself, in the sciences was not so much a social problem (as it was for the Berlin Maskilim) as a religious one. It reflected negatively on Judaism, and led observers to the conclusion that Judaism itself was some- how inferior. He voiced this concern in the following terms: The Gentiles abuse us and say that we are a foolish nation, not a wise one. They consequently slander the words of our sages, and say that whoever studies them becomes divorced from the norms of civility and from nature [yibadel mi-hok ha-medini ve-teva olam].50 Here Schick was echoing in his own terms the vilification of the Talmud practiced by adherents of the European Enlightenment. Enlightenment thinkers perennially blamed the Talmud for the Jews' obscurantism, back- wardness, and separatism. It was, they asserted, a compendium of supersti- tions, nonsense, and lies which had perverted the Jews' thinking and character. In order to enlighten the Jews and render them worthy of emanci- pation, they would first have to be drawn away from the pernicious influence of the Talmud.5' Schick cared little about the Jews' emancipation or enlightenment, but he could not remain indifferent to the defamation of the Talmud. In partic- ular, he was disturbed by the charge that "whoever studies [it] becomes divorced from . . . nature," i.e., that in its content and spirit, the Talmud was inimical to science. This struck at the very essence of his personal being as a rabbi, and as a rabbinic scientist. Schick responded to the charge with an impassioned defense of the Talmud, claiming that it was a veritable treasure house of science. Such was not the way of our sages. No mystery, discipline, or science eluded them. This is evident from many statements in the Talmud, made in just a few words. Such as the statement in the Gemara Berachot [58b], "if comets passed through the galaxy of Orion, the world would be destroyed"; and the magnify- ing glass of Rabbi Gamliel [Eruvin 43b]; and all the matters of trefot in which they were highly expert, such as the animal-wound which, "if salves are applied, [the animal] will survive" [Hulin 54a], as opposed to those wounds which it would not survive.52 50.

The claim that the rabbis of antiquity had been masters of science, or even that the sciences had originated among them and been lost in the travails of</page><page sequence="24">118 DAVID FISHMAN On a more basic level, Schick's entire campaign after his stay in Berlin to spread scientific learning among rabbinic scholars was motivated by a desire to respond to the Enlightenment's assault on the Talmud. For in the final analysis, the charge that the Talmud was a pernicious, obscurantist force could not be refuted by mere textual arguments, but by living examples of talmudists who were also devotees of science. As long as the symbolic repre- sentatives of Talmudic Judaism, the rabbis, remained ignoramuses in these matters, Judaism's name would continue to be scarred. Schick's intensive program of publication and propaganda on behalf of science, following his visit to Berlin, was driven by an apologetic urge to disprove the slanderous charges against Judaism and the Talmud that he had encountered in the West. His transformation from a scholar into an engaged activist was thus a direct result of his exposure to the Enlightenment, his being profoundly troubled by its view of Judaism, and his desiring to refute that view to the best of his ability. Since the issue at stake was, according to Schick's understanding, a religious one ("what is the nature of Judaism?"), his efforts were directed at reforming the intellectual profile of the rabbinic elite, which was the living embodiment of the talmudic tradition. The reform of Jewish elementary education, a primary concern of Mendelssohn, Wessely, and Friedliinder in the 1780s, was not on Schick's agenda. This is reflected in the content of Schick's books, which were designed not for Jewish schoolchildren, but rather for sharp talmudic minds. They moved rapidly from basic principles to complex and difficult theorems, challenging their readers at every step of the way. In the introduction to Uklides, Schick's apologetic concerns shared the limelight with the traditional argument that knowledge of the sciences facil- itated and enhanced the elucidation of hallowed texts. (This was likewise the gist of the remarks Schick quoted from the Vilna Gaon, that "for every deficiency of knowledge in the sciences, one will have ten deficiencies of knowledge in the science of the Torah.") But in his introduction to Keneh Ha-Midah there was no such balance between religious and apologetic arguments. Without making so much as an allusion to the religious or halakhic benefits to be gained from the study of science, he addressed himself solely to its apologetic importance, as a means by which the public image of Judaism would be rehabilitated. exile, was an old one. What was new in Schick's case was the use of this argument as part of a polemic against the Enlightenment's view of Judaism.</page><page sequence="25">A POLISH RABBI MEETS THE BERLIN HASKALAH 119 In these times, "science" serves to increase the honor of the Torah. It renders Torah scholars honorable and esteemed in the eyes of the nations and princes. I have therefore decided to come to the aid of Israel and to lift up the fallen crown of Judah.53 To sum up this point, Schick did not become a Maskil after Berlin, but he was, nonetheless, substantially affected by his exposure to the enlightened view that Judaism was obscurantist. His response was two-pronged. On the one hand he argued that the rabbis in the time of the Talmud were deeply involved in the study of science, and at the same time he devoted himself fully to disseminating scientific learning among contemporary rabbis and talmudists. By responding to the enlightened critique of Judaism, and unconsciously internalizing a small portion of its worldview, Schick moved beyond the self-contained parameters of rabbinic science. He became a ray maskil, a rabbi who was himself, to a certain degree, influenced by the atti- tudes of the Enlightenment. There were other noteworthy changes in Schick's writings following his visit to Berlin. One was related to their scope and content. Schick's major treatises in his post-Berlin years were devoted exclusively to mathematics, with the natural and biological sciences conspicuously absent. Gone were anatomy and astronomy; in their place came geometry, algebra, and trigo- nometry. Why this sudden narrowing of purview? As we suggested earlier, Schick discovered in Berlin that his knowledge of the natural sciences was inferior and backward, compared to that of Gentile scholars. In the purely mathematical disciplines, the gap between him and German scholars was considerably narrower. Wessely had taken note of this discrepancy: on the one hand, Gentile scholars "marveled" at Schick's level of knowledge in geometry; on the other hand, he "did not know anything of the natural sciences."54 In Berlin, Schick reached much the same conclusion; and in his subsequent works he "retreated" to the disciplines where his knowledge was on firm ground, and not as blatantly outmoded. A second change related to the sources Schick utilized. After Berlin he discontinued his previous practice of drawing scientific data from the Talmud, Zohar, and Maimonides. Instead he undertook a project of trans- lating foreign scientific works into Hebrew. Rather than combining the 53. Keneh Ha-Midah (Prague, 1783), introduction. 54.

This shift is attributable to Schick's discovery that the scientific information contained in his rabbinic sources was somewhat problematic, a discovery which was an integral part of the culture shock he experienced in Berlin. Schick's failure to utilize the Zohar is particularly noteworthy. The latter was as replete with mystical mathematics (i.e., numerology) as it was with mystical anatomy, but Schick refrained from mining the Zohar for math as he had once done for anatomy.55 In general, Schick's connection with Kabbalah weakened after his stay in Berlin. He did not preface Uklides or Keneh Ha-Midah with a kabbalistic mystique of numbers-a theme with a long tradition-akin to his mystique of the human body in Tiferet Adam. Kabbalistic arguments for science were now part of his past. Schick alluded but once in his introduction to Uklides to a passage from the Zohar; his citation was elliptic, he offered no inter- pretation of its ambiguous words, and in the context of his argumentation it carried little weight.56 The decline in the position of Kabbalah in Schick's thought was likely the result of assaults on it by enlightened Jews in Berlin, who viewed Kabbalah as superstitious and nonsensical. In sum, Schick's exposure to Berlin brought on key changes in his works of science as such. Their scope and content were narrowed to mathematics alone. Non-Jewish treatises displaced rabbinic literature as a source of information, and the rationales presented for the study of scientific disci- plines underwent a marked transformation. The kabbalistic mode of ration- alization died and was no more; the halakhic-talmudic rationale receded in importance, and a new apologetic rationale assumed a preeminent position. These changes in purview, sources, and rationale constituted a move away from the tradition of rabbinic science, and a rapprochement with modern European science. Conclusion The case of R. Barukh Schick is a rare instance in which the indigenous rabbinic tradition of science and the Berlin Haskalah encountered each other face-to-face. These two intellectual currents should not be confused 55. On Jewish number mysticism and gematria, see Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (Jerusa- lem, 1974), pp. 38-39, 54, 337-343. 56.

As a result of their shared interest in science, Schick and the Berlin circle were able to collaborate on a project of mutual interest. Schick's story indicates how the two trends could mutually influence each other. Although he remained deaf to most of the Haskalah's message, particularly to its social and political goals, Schick was deeply affected by the enlightened critique of rabbinic Judaism as obscurantist and antithetical to science. In the specific area of science, Schick was transformed into a crusader and reformer. This is an instance of Haskalah ideology being inter- nalized in a fractured, fragmentary form. Schick's campaign to introduce scientific learning among rabbis and talmudists was motivated, to a considerable extent, by apologetic concerns, i.e., a desire to defend rabbinic Judaism against its enlightened detractors. His apologetic stance was predicated upon a partial, if unconscious, accep- tance of their value system. In this respect, Schick may be seen as a para- digm for a certain type of traditionalist rabbi which one finds in the nineteenth century -the rabbi who combines science and Torah primarily as a demonstrative apologetic act, in order to prove that Judaism is "wise and understanding." In the minds of such rabbis, the issue of science was divorced both from theology and from broader cultural, social, and political concerns of the day.
