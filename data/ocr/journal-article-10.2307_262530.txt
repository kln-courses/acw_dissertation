<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID MET. i BY FRANK EGLESTON ROBBINS The account of the origin of the universe offered by Ovid in Met. i. 5-88 bears so many resemblances, in one passage or another, to various ancient cosmic theories that commentators have failed to agree in determining the authority on whom Ovid depended. Among those that have been put forward are the Egyptians,' Empedocles,2 Anaxagoras,3 and Varro.4 None of the advocators of these sugges- tions have found it possible to show that Ovid adhered consistently in every detail to the systems which they select as his models; nor do I, in making a further attempt at the solution of the problem, expect to display the poet as a strict sectarian in his cosmogony. The fact must be recognized at the beginning that a thorough and consistent adherence to one theory is not to be found in the Ovidian account of the universe, and, furthermore, is not to be expected. Ovid did not possess the philosophic temperament of Vergil, and in the Meta- morphoses he is not so much concerned with setting forth true explanations as with telling stories in an interesting and graceful way. No one, in other words, would regard the Metamorphoses as a didactic and not a narrative poem. On the other hand, it is equally certain that Ovid employed ma- terial which he drew from previous writers, and scholars have made exhaustive studies of his borrowings.5 In the present discussion, however, the question will be rather that of the sources of his views of the world than of his adoption of the phraseology of other writers. Before entering upon a more minute discussion of these ideas, another a priori assumption should be noted, namely, that in all ' Gierig's edition, revised by Lemaire, Paris, 1821. 2 Carlo Pascal, L'imitazione di Empedocle nelle Metamorfosi di Ovidio reprinted in Graccia Capta, Firenze, 1905. 3 Most recently by F.

[CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY VIII, October, 19131 401</page><page sequence="2">402 FRANK EGLESTON RoBBINS probability Ovid, in view of his generally non-philosophical char- acter, would not be so likely to delve into the half-forgotten theories of the pre-Socratics and present anew a consistent account based on one of them as to set forth opinions that were commonly held in his own time and were familiar to his readers. This introduces another difficulty, which is really the fundamental one of the whole problem. In Ovid's time the popular philosophic-scientific theories were the product of eclecticism, containing elements which were ultimately derived from many sources, a situation which is cer- tain to cause confusion and inconsistency in the non-technical poets of Ovid's type, and which is likely to lead astray commentators who seek to locate the sources of their ideas. Certain fundamental notions came at this time to be used in common, and it is therefore useless to declare that a writer follows any individual philosophical school because he uses one of these commonplaces, unless it is also possible to point out in his work ideas characteristic of the sect with which it is sought to identify him. Turning now to the discussion of Ovid's creation narrative and taking up in order the various theories that have been proposed with regard to its source, we may first dismiss as improbable that which makes the poet derive his lore from the Egyptians. It has never been seriously considered and is supported only by one citation of the prooemium of Diogenes Laertius. A second theory, which asserts that Ovid drew upon Anaxagoras, has quite recently been advocated by F. Polle (supra, p. 401, n. 3). It is readily seen, as Polle admits, that there are such fundamental differences between Ovid's ideas and the doctrines of Anaxagoras that it cannot be claimed that Ovid followed Anaxagoras at all consistently. The elements of the uni- verse in Ovid are the common four, but according to Anaxagoras they were the corpuscles of all sorts of denominate substances, just the opposite of the Empedoclean elements, as Aristotle declared (De gen. et corr. i. 1. 314a 24). Furthermore, Socrates, whose dis- appointment with the way in which Anaxagoras employed the Nous in his cosmogony is related in Phaedo 97B ff., could hardly have imiade the same objections to the deus of the Ovidian passage, whose activity in the ordering of the cosmos is emphasized throughout. If Anaxagoras made mere mechanical processes too prominent, just</page><page sequence="3">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID 403 the opposite is true of Ovid. In view of these fundamental dis- crepancies and of the fact that it is impossible to show that Ovid set forth any of the distinctive doctnrnes of Anaxagoras, this proposal also may be rejected. A third suggestion is Empedocles, whom Carlo Pascal has recently put forth as a Greek source for Ovid (supra, p. 401, n. 2). It must be granted that in some respects Ovid's account resembles that of Empedocles-in the introduction of four elements, and the chaos. But the deus of Ovid fails to correspolnd with 4kX677s in Empedocles, and there is no inention of a power opposite to d)IX6rs, one of the essentials of the Empedoclean system.1 And if we compare the words of the two poets in the passages cited by Pascal, we shall find in the cases where there are real parallels what he should have himself observed, that Ovid is affected by Empedocles only through the medium of Lucretius. For example, Pascal compares the following: Met. i. 10 ff.: nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan, nec noua crescendo reparabat coomua Phoebe, nec circumfuso pendebat in aOre teUus ponderibus librata suis, nee bracchia longo margine terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite.

Lucr. v. 432-34: hiec neque tum solis rota cerni lumine largo altiuolans potert nee magni sidera mundi nec mare nec caelum nec denique terra neque aer. Of the two possible sources the probabilities surely favor Lucretius. Pascal states that the use of Titan (= sol) is derived from Empedocles (v. 236 M., fr. 8 Diels) but reference to the text shows that it is a common Ovidian usage and occurs also in contemporary poetry.2 With lines 24-25 Pascal compares Emped. v. 163 ff. M., where it is said that after Ne' ov came to the bottom of the vortex and 4t(PA' Cf. the review in W. kl. Ph., 1903, p. 769. 2 Ovid Met. ii. 118; vi. 438; Fasti i. 617; ii* 73: iv. 180, 919; Pance.

The likeness, verbally considered, is not convincing, and as before it may be objected that Ovid does not mention NeZ,Kos at all, while his deus is not very like 4&amp;X6r77. Instead of comparing Ovid i. 26-27: ignea conuexi uis et sine pondere caeli emnicuit summaque locum sibi fecit in arce, inth Emped. v. 261 M.: [gKGoPE ALEY 7rpw'TOV rVp] Kap7raXM'Aws a'o/'rato' it is muchl better to cite Lucr. v. 459 f.: :.... erumpens primus se sustulit aether ignifer et multos secum leulis abstulit ignis. The few other parallels which Pascal suggests have even less to recoili- mend them. If we are to admit that there was any Empedoclean influence on Ovid, it is far safer to suppose that it came through Lucretius. This leads naturally to the consideration of the relation between the Lucretian and the Ovidian accounts. Now, however true it be that Ovid shows traces of Lucretian influence, certain important differences prove that he was setting forth no Epicurean or Lucretian theory of creation. The greatest point of divergence is that Ovid ascribes creation to some god, " deus et melior . . . . natura," 21; "quisquis fuit ille deorum," 32; "mundi fabricator," 57; "opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo," 79; but Lucretius bluntly says (v. 419-20): nam certe neque consilio primordia rerum ordine se suo quaeque sagaci mente locarunt. Secondly, the semina in the two accounts' (for both use the term) differ. Ovid's semina are the four elements' endowed with qualities- cold, hot, dry, wet-that to Lucretius are secondary.3 They are not at all the Epicurean atoms. Thirdly, Ovid says the earth is a globe (33-34). Lucretius does not make any direct statement, but he Onid i. 9; Lucr. v. 456. 2 It is evident that "caelo terras undas a6re," 22-23, refer to the four elements, and line 9 would without doubt refer to the mixture of these elements. There are also rougher tripartite divisions: "mare terras caelum," 5, and "tellus pontus aer," 15; cf. for the former Lucr. v. 92, 594. 3 Lucr. ii. 730 ff.</page><page sequence="5">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID 405 probably thought it flat,' and in any case his theory of its support by another body beneath it is unknown to Ovid.2 Fourthly, the stars according to Ovid are placed in the ether (69-71) but according to Lucretius in the air below the ether (v. 472). Fifthly, there is no suggestion of a divine origin for man in Lucretius as in Ovid. Besides these there are minor differences in the order in which the events of the evolutionary process are related. Notwithstanding these important differences, certain phrases of Met. i are so like expressions found in De nat. rer. v that Ovid's use of Lucretian material is a natural assumption.3 But this need not be more than verbal reminiscence, for, as was pointed out above, a community of commonplace ideas between two poets of this period of eclecticism argues no necessary dependence of one upon the other. Both Lucretius and Ovid begin by describing a chaotic state of matter. In Lucretius it is the fact that there is no consilium to guide themn which bring the atoms into this chaos (v. 416-31, espe- cially 429-31). Now, though the conception of a chaotic state is similar in the two, it has already been seen that the component parts, the semina, are very unlike, and furthermore the notion of a chaos is so common a thing in ancient writers that Ovid might have taken it from alnost any source besides Lucretius, or simply have versified one of the ideas that was in the air in his time.4 The passages (Ovid 1-14; Lucr. 432-34) in which the poets describe the chaotic state ICf. Munro on Lucr. v. 534 and 764. ' Luer. v. 534 ff. 3 Zingerle's work (cited above) conclusively shows that Ovid knew and used Lucretius. 'The term "chaos," used by Ovid, is not found in Lucretius; it is not, in fact, a part of the strictly philosophical vocabulary. It occurs in Hesiod Theoag. 46 and there- after frequently in Greek poetry. The notion of a chaotic condition at first is extremely common; Euripides (Melanippe) fr. 488; Aristoph. Aaes 693; Apoll.

It was certainly a part of the Ep icurea system, as Lucretius shows. Verg. Ecl. vi. 31 describes a sort of Epicurean chaos. In the Orphic writers, also, descriptions of a chaos something like Ovid's occur; e.g., (Clem. Rom.) Recog. x. 30, Abel, p. 162; and Apoll. Rhod. as cited. Diod. Sic. i. 7 has a description of a chaos. In poetry, cf. (Tib.) iv. 1. 18, where a chaos would naturally precede the ordering process described, though the poet does not expressly say so; also Ovid Ars am. ii. 467 ff.; Fasti i. 105 iff., which are quite similar to Met. i.</page><page sequence="6">406 FRANK EGLESTON ROBBINS are very similar and may be real parallels (supra, p. 403), though they need be considered no more than verbal ones. But when in vs. 15-20 Ovid explains that this condition was due to the conflict of the ele- ments, and Lucretius (435-42) that it was due to atomic motions, they are far from agreement; and the same is true when Ovid ends this conflict by the intervention of the deus, Lucretius by the attrac- tion of likes. There are a few other passages the wording of which is similar,' but this need be no more than the casual likeness that is to be looked for in poets treating similar subjects with a similar back- ground of well-known ideas-it being admitted of course that Ovid knew the De natura rerum and might have adapted some of its phrases to his own use. No more is to be inferred from the passages describ- ing how the parts of the universe came to occupy their present positions:2 these are commonplaces. In view of the fact that Ovid and Lucretius are, as has been shown, absolutely opposed to one another in their general conception of the world, its evolution, and God, and in the lack of clearer evidence of conscious imitation (only one parallel cited is really of more than secondary importance-Ovid i. 10-14; Lucr. v. 432-34), it must be concluded that the resemblances between them are either merely adventitious or purely literary. None of the suggestions thus far considered has proved fruitful, yet it is quite certain from their character that Ovid's ideas were derived perhaps from one, perhaps from more than one, philosophic source. In order to throw light upon these sources we may profitably examine certain passages of Cicero which represent views of the uni- I Ovid 22-23: nam caelo terras et terris abscidit undas et liquidum spisso secreuit ab aere caelum. Luer. 446-48: hoc est, a terris altum secernere caelum, et sorsum mare uti secreto umore pateret, seorsus item puri secretique aetheris ignes. Other speciously similar passages: concerning the sea and winds, Ov. 36-37; Lucr. 503-4; the making of hills and plains, Ov. 43-44; Lucr. 492-93; cf. also Ovid 68 (of the ether): " nec quicquam terrenae faecis habentem," with Lucr. 497 (of the earth): "subsedit funditus ut faex." Editors of Ovid here compare Homer P 425: drp4erov ariG4c. X Fire rose (Ov. 26-27; Luer. 458-59) and took the highest place (Ov. 27; Luer. 470, 500-S501); air is next lower (Ov. 28; Luer. 501; cf. 472, 490); earth is heavy (Ov. 29-30; Luer. 429) and in the middle (Ov. 31; Lucr. 451); water surrounds the earth (Ov. 31; Lucr. 498).</page><page sequence="7">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID 407 verse commonly held in Ovid's own time. They are not so much con- cerned with the world's origin as with the arrangement of its parts, but still they will be of service. One of these is Tusc. disp. i. 17. 40: " persuadent enim mathematici terram in medio mundo sitam ad uniuersi caeli complexum quasi puncti instar obtinere, quod ice'VTpov illi uocant; eam porro naturam esse quattuor omnia gignentium corporum, ut, quasi partita habeant inter se ac diuisa momenta., terrena et humida suopte nutu et suo pondere ad paris angulos in terram et in inare ferantur, reliquae duae partes, una ignea, altera animalis, ut illae superiores in medium locum mundi grauitate feran- tur et pondere, sic hae rursum rectis lineis in caelestem locum sub- uolent, siue ipsa natura superiora adpetente, siue quod a grauioribus leuiora natura repellantur." The second is very similar, De nat. dear. ii. 91: " principio enim terra sita in media parte mundi circumfusa undique est hac animali spirabilique natura cui nomen est aer .... hunc rursus amplectitur immensus aether, qui constat ex altissimis igfnibus," etc. The similarity of these passages to Ovid's description of the arrangement of the world is obvious (cf. especially vs. 26-31). Now it is very probable that both these passages were borrowed by Cicero from Stoic sources. In the second case this is sure;' the second book of the De natura deorum is a Stoic exposition through- out; and the first is quite certainly Stoic as well,2 both from the fact that it is in juxtaposition with other Stoic passages and from its like- ness to the De nat. deor. ii. 91. In addition we may note that it is known from other sources that the Stoics made such statements about the universe.3 Besides these general agreements, there are several other Cice- ronian passages which, each introduced in a Stoic context, parallel the most famous lines of Met. i, namely, 84-86: pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram os homini sublime dedit! caelumque uidere iussit et erectos ad sidera tollere uultus. I See 'Mayor on the sources of De nmt. deor. ii in his edition, II, xvi ff. 2 See Dougan, Tusc. disp., Introd. xxi, for a summary of the views of scholars, and p. xxiii for Titsc. disp. i. 17. 40. 3E.g., Diog. Laer. vii. 137, 155.</page><page sequence="8">408 FRANK EGLESTON ROBBINS In the same Stoic book of the De natura deorum Cicero writes (56. 140): "quli [i.e. di] primum eos [i.e. homines] excitatos celsos et erectos constituerunt, ut deorum cognitionem caelum intuentes capere possent." This evidently was adduced as a proof of design in the world in the Stoic teleological argument which he copies. Again we find the same thought in De legg. i. 9. 26-27: "nam cum ceteros animantis abiecisset ad pastum, soluin hominem erexit et ad caeli quasi cognationis domiciliique pristini conspectum excitauit, tum speciem ita formauit oris ut in ea penitus reconditos mores effingeret."' The topic of man's erect stature was a common one among ancient writers' and upon this alone one could not base an argument concern- ing Ovid's sources. Yet, after Plato and Aristotle, it seems to have been fairly distinctive of the Stoic school, and I wish in short to argue that so many of Ovid's utterances are paralleled by the common topics of the Stoic writers, without any serious discrepancies which do not find a natural explanation, that, in view of the ease with which it could have come about, it is probable that the reading of Stoic treatises or of books influenced by Stoicism was the strongest influ- ence exerted upon the poet in Met. i. 5-88. In the first place, to examine the agreements between Ovid and the Stoics, we have the matter of the elements. In i. 19 ("frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis") there is evidently a reference to the Stoic classification of the air as cold, fire hot, water wet, and earth dry,3 the assignment of one quality only to each being a dis- tinctively Stoic feature, for Aristotle had asserted that each element has two distinguishing qualities. Again in the next line, "mollia cuni duris, sine pondere, habentia pondus," there may be a glance at the Stoic distinction between air and fire as light and earth and water as heavy.4 In the second place, there is much that can be urged to show that the Ovidian deus is modeled after the Stoic theology. In view of the I Also Tu.9c. di8p. i. 69: "hominemque ipsum quasi contemplatorem caeli ac deorum cultorem"; cf. Met. i. 85-86. 2 See Mayor's note upon De nat. dear. ii. 56. 140 and S. 0.

The deus is certainly derived rather from philosophical sources. It has been shown above that the Ovidian deus is neither of the Epicurean, Empedoclean, nor Anaxagorean types. By this method of elimination the possi- bilities are reduced practically to two out of all ancient philosophy, Plato and the Stoics. Now the cosmogony of Ovid differs too much from that of the Timaeus to allow us to believe that the latter was its direct source; on the other hand, seeming Platonic reminiscences in Ovid inay easily be regarded as coming at second hand to him, in view of the adoption of so many of the topics of the Timaeus by subsequent schools, including the Stoics. The Stoics believed in a supreme deity, who established this world in wisdom and providence.2 These attributes well suit the deus of Ovid, who puts a stop to the warring of the elements: "hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit" (21). In other passages the god is represented as acting for the good of the world, in a providential manner: cf. 32 ff., 47 f., "sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem cura dei": 79, "mundi melioris origo." It has already been pointed out3 that the epithet melior natura (21) may be a reference to the Stoic identification of God and Nature, or Nature permeated by God. It might further be claimed that Ovid's hesitation to name the god concerned in the creation ("quisquis fuit ille deorum," 32) may be due to a certain unclearness on the part of the Stoics who were his sources, who, as the interlocutor in Cicero remarks, identify God now with the world, now with the world-soul, and again with natural law or the ether,4 and as Diogenes Laertius' tells us named the 1 In this connection note that lightning in this passage (56: "et cum fulminibus facientes frigora uentos") is regarded as a purely meteorological phenomenon rather than as Jove's weapon, as below in i. 197, 253, 259, etc. Diog.

In strict logic, of course, the expression suggests one of a number of gods, rather than one god under various names; but a poet does not have to adhere to strict logic. It has already been seen (supra, p. 407) that Ovid's description of the arrangemnent of the parts of the world is in accord with that of the Stoics. The passage concerning chaos (5-20) is not so easy to parallel, perhaps because the Stoic cosmogony is not fully known to us; but in one respect at least, the employment of elements and not atoms, the two are in full accord. It may be that Ovid introduced the chaos simply as the general belief of his day and as a common poetic motif,' and with this interwove the Stoic ideas of the elements and a Deity; it is possible on the other hand that his notion of a chaos could have been derived from his reading of the Stoics. One account of the Stoic cosmogony at least suggests a chaotic state; Diog. Laer. vii. 136: Kar' apXas j.ep ovv KaM' aTvr o6prva [sc.

The making of the four elements is again described by Diogenes in vii. 142, and it is there stated that by 1.zs plants and animals were made from them. It is natural to assume that in this process the four elements were thought of as exist- ing together at first, not separated off from one another, just as in Met. i. 5-20. The Ciceronian passages quoted above also imply that this state of mixture formed part of the Stoic theory. Ovid, then, would simply omit, as poor poetic material and unsanctioned by poetic convention, the details regarding changes in matter previous to the production of the elements, and the doctrine of the aTrEp,aTLoK1s n&amp;yos, as we find them in Diogenes Laertius.9 It is to be noted further that in both the Ovidian and the Stoic ' See above, p. 405, n. 4. The notion of a conflict or battle between the elements (Mct. i. 18 if.) can hardly be paralleled from Stoic sources, but may well be explained, as a poetic, rather than philosophic, motif, sanctioned by such passages as Lucr. v. 439: "proelia miscens"; Apoll. Rhod. i. 498: 1EiKEOS 5' t dXooZo, etc. 2 But for the orEpp/AaTrtKZs X&amp;yos doctrine in Ovid see infra, p. 413.</page><page sequence="11">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID 411 accounts the development of the world from chaos is due to divine agency, therein differing radically from the pre-Socratic cosmogonies with their doctrine of a cosmic whorl, 3lvi, which sorts things out and generates the universe. Deus et melior natura-God, not necessarily an anthropomorphic god, but perhaps rather divine power in nature working for a good end-is the agent of creation in Ovid, just as the Stoic Zeus, remaining in matter and sometimes identified with Nature, is the cause of cosmic evolution. Lesser parallels with the Stoic writings in considerable number may be pointed out in the Ovidian creation narrative. With verse 45 begins a passage describing the zones of both the sky and the earth: 45: utque duae dextra caelum totidemque sinistra parte secant zonae, quinta est ardentior illis; sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem cura dei, totidemque plagae tellure premuntur. quarum quae media est, non est habitabilis aestu; 50: nix tegit alta duas; totidem inter utramque locauit, temperiemque dedit mixta cum frigore flamma. This topic is one which was treated both by poets and by scientific men. We are informed that Parmenides first defined the inhabited portions of the earth with reference to the zones of the tropics,' also that Pythagoras divided the earth into the five commonly named zones.2 We are upon much firmer ground when we find it stated that the Stoics spoke of the five circles in the heavens and the five zones of the earth. The straightforward account of the Stoic teaching upon this point is very like the Ovidian passage cited: Diog.

Tusc. dsp. i. 28. 68-69.</page><page sequence="12">412 FRANK EGLESTON RoBBINS In two other respects Ovid agrees with the Stoics, and disagrees, it may be noted, with the Epicureans, in holding that the stars are in the caelum, that is, in the ether (70-71), and that the earth is spherical (34-35).' Finally we mnust consider the passage which narrates the creation of man, ending with the lines on his erect stature already discussed above: 72: neu regio foret ulla suis animantibus orba, astra tenent caeleste solum formaeque deorum, cesserunt nitidis habitandae piscibus undae, 7o5: terra feras cepit, uolucres agitabilis aer. sanctius his animal mentisque capacius altae deerat adhuc, et quod dominari in cetera posset. natus homo est: siue hunc diuino semine fecit ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo, SO: siue recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto aethere cognati retinebat semina caeli, quam satus lapeto mixtam fluuialibus undis finxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum. The first few lines, 72-75, present the notion, fairly common in antiquity, that each element has its own inhabitant. Plato seems first to have used the topic, but it is important to note that Cicero in the Stoic second book of the De natura deorum (42) mentions it as an opinion of Aristotle.2 This, then, along with so many other ideas of Plato and Aristotle, was apparently appropriated by the Stoics, and Ovid might more probably have taken it at third hand from a Stoic source than directly from Plato or Aristotle. More closely related to Stoicism is the use of animantibus, 72, which shows that the stars, mentioned in 73, are regarded by Ovid as animated-a good Stoic doctrine.3 In 73 the stars also are called formae deorum, which accords with the Stoic belief that the stars are gods.4 1 For Stoic views on the first point, see Cic. De net. deor. ii. 42, 92, 117-18; for the second, Plac. iii. 10. 1; Diog. Laer. vii. 145. 2Plato Tim. 39E; on the use of this topic see Robbins, The Hezaemeral Literature, Chicago, 1912, 9, n. 5. The reference to Aristotle is probably to the lost De philosophia; see Mayor on De nat. deor. ii. 42, who collects references. 3 Cic. De nat. deor. ii. 41-42. 4 Cic. De nat. deor. loc. cit.; Chrysippus ap. Plut. Stoic. Rep. 38. 5; Plac. i. 7. 33 The Stoics, however (and apparently also Ovid), would not identify the stars and the highest god, whose seat is in the ether with the stars; Diog. Laer. vii. 138-39.</page><page sequence="13">THE CREATION STORY IN OVID 413 There are two suggestions as to the making of man, that he was made diuino semine by the mysterious creator, or that in the clay fashioned by Prometheus lingered some of the fire of heaven, semina caeli. The first seems to have been suggested by the very character- istic Stoic doctrine of the arep,4uarKOs XO4Yos generating principles con- tained in the irvp TeXVLK4P, or highest god, "in accordance with which individual things come into existence by Destiny."' The second sug- gestion, though not so philosophic in character and apparently a concession to mythology, is not without its bearing on Stoicism. According to the Stoics the mind of man is of the same pure fire as the heavens, unlike the burning fire commonly seen.2 The statement in 83, that man was made in the image of the gods, is hardly Stoic in origin;3 at least, we cannot parallel it from the Stoic sources in our present state of knowledge. But it occurs in a mythological con- text and really belongs with the stories of the same character later on in the book, where the gods do have human shapes.4 The present discussion has at least served to show that it is need- less to search for Ovid's sources outside of the beliefs that were cur- rently held in his day. Those who attempt to establish a connection between Ovid and any of the pre-Socratics are forced to rely upon the presence in both of perfectly commonplace ideas and sooner or later meet with grave unlikenesses. Lafaye's arguments in favor of Varro as a source are indefinite and unsupported by evidence. On the other hand, comparing Ovid and Stoic doctrine, we have been able I Plac. i. 7. 33: lrp reXYvuKb 0'5 ga8tioy &amp;Z -Yieov K6qlAOv, IyTepteLX7?Pbs Td1ras 7TOS aoTEp/.aLKOLS X6yous, KaO' ots &amp;Kaara MOa' eI.v.zptPv ytseraq; cf. also Ritter and Preller, Hist.

Laer. vii. 147). But it is to be noticed that Ovid is speaking of di, not the opifex rerum. 4 E.g., i. 213.</page><page sequence="14">414 FRANK EGLESTON ROBBINS to show agreement in the several items of the elements, their arrange- ment, the erect stature of man, the characteristic qualities of the elements, the creating deity, the zones, the place of the stars, the earth, the proper inhabitants of each of the elements, the animation of the stars, their divinity, the divine seed of man, and the likeness of his mind to the divine fire. Some of these topics are peculiar to Stoicism; all could have been found in the Stoic treatises on the world and its providential ordering. Stoicism in Ovid's day was well known at Rome, and Stoic sources were perhaps easiest of access to Ovid. He would not, in view of his own character and the nature of his project, seek to outline faithfully and in all its detail the Stoic cosmogony; but it has been seen in how few places he has failed to accord with the latter. In view of all these things I regard it highly probable that the account presented by Ovid is essentially Stoic. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIIGAN</page></plain_text>
