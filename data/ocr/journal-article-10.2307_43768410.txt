In the text to the CV A (p. 66), Dr. Söldner rightly associates this kantharos with the workshop of the Darius Painter and places it in the Group of New York 28.57.10; it seems to us perhaps better to place it here together with the other kantharoi of similar shape and decoration. 3. Plastic Vases (i)(a) The Negro Group Negro Head 75a Taranto. Seated youth. We owe our knowledge of this vase to the kindness of Robert Hecht who informed us that it was almost a replica of no. 75 (PI. 235,3) and that it was found in a tomb together with a bronze helmet of Corinthian shape and a terracotta patera with a frontal head in the bowl, surrounded by a white vine-wreath, and an anthropomorphic handle in the form of a youth (cf. no. 27/72-1). 188</page><page sequence="18">CHAPTER 21 (ii) Associated with the Paidagogos Group The following vasę, of unique shape, consists of a kantharos of the Paidagogos Group on top of a plastic head which rests upon a moulded base, the upper edge of which is decorated with egg-pattern in white and yellow. It may be compared with the janiform kantharos in the Cabinet des Médailles (1237; no. 83, pl. 235,4) and provides a close connecting link between the Paidagogos Group and the plastic vases. Kantharos on plastic head *83a Once New York Market, Antiquari urn Ltd. Plate XLIX, 1-3 (a) Orestes with drawn sword seated to 1., with frontal head, on altar, (b) woman seated to r. on folding stool, with head turned lo I., holding mirror in r. hand and open box in I. The scenes on both sides are framed between white Ionic columns (cf. the obverses of nos. 63-66). The plastic head is that of an Amazon, the side-flaps of whose Phrygian cap come down on either side of her neck. (iii)(a) Vases with plastic heads Oenochoe *94a Stanford (Calif.), Dr. Arnold Kriegstein. Plate XLIX, 4-6 This oenochoe, to which reference has already been made in Part I on p. 118, in connection with the figure in the naiskos on no. 17/33b, takes the form of a plastic female head of considerable beauty; the head is painted white, with the lips in red, the eyebrows, eye-lashes, and pupil of the eyes in black, which was also used for the hair, though there much of it has now disappeared. Above the brow and round the back of the head is a broad band of red material, with white patterns; it is wound across the top of the head above the hair in a series of twisted coils, and runs down on to the neck behind the ears in two flat strips. The earrings are in the form of small female heads with a red head-dress. The vase has a high handle, and a trefoil mouth (as in Shape 1); the neck is decorated with berried laurel in added white and the shoulder with black scroll-work on a reserved band. Above the head, encircling the vase, is a band of floral decoration in added white and yellow. On the back of the head, in added white, yellow and red, is the figure of a woman seated on a chest, holding a bird in her r. hand and a fan in her 1.; her head is shown in profile, turned back to 1., and she is flanked by floral decoration. Reference has already been made (see p. 1 16 in Part I) to the close stylistic connection between this figure and the woman in the naiskos on no. 17/33b, which looks as if it might well be the work of the same hand. The hydria was associated with the Group of Copenhagen 4223, contemporary with the earlier work of the Darius Painter, which would suggest a date for the present vase around 340 B.C. A pelike with plastic decoration on the obverse Pelike *94b Geneva 27800. Plate L, 1 -2 J. Chamay, Genava 38, 1990, pp. 81-85, figs. l-3b. (a) Plastic - the birth of Aphrodite from a scallop-shell, (b) in r.f. - Eros flying in front of Aphrodite beside a scallop-shell. This vase is unique in Apulian red-figure, since the obverse is in full relief, the reverse in the normal red-figure technique. On the obverse, emerging from a scallop, which looks to have been modelled from an actual shell, is the upper part of a figure of Aphrodite, wearing an elaborate head-dress, earrings and a necklace with two rows of beads; her arms are outstretched, and each hand is covered by a piece of red drapery, patterned with white crosses, which spreads out in front of her. The forward surge of the figure 189</page><page sequence="19">VASES DECORATED WITH FIGURED SCENES enhances the liveliness of the composition. On the reverse we return to the standard r.f. technique; here again the centre is occupied by the scallop, in added white, less realistically represented than on the obverse, and now closing after the emergence of Aphrodite. She is flying past, naked save for a long piece of almost transparent drapery, patterned with black crosses, which falls over her r. shoulder and is touched by her r. hand; in front of her flies Eros, his head turned in her direction, who grasps the drapery in each hand as it swirls around her. Both wear white radiate stephanai, necklaces, bracelets, a double strand of beads round the r. thigh, and white anklets. Below the handle is an enclosed palmette-fan with side-scrolls and smaller fans, enlivened by the presence of white dots. Stylistically, the vase is not easy to place, but from the pattern-work and the figures on the reverse, it looks to belong to the area of the Darius Painter and his associates, rather than to one of the later schools of Apulian. The upper part of Aphrodite's body finds a distant parallel on a Gnathian askos in the form of a siren (Lecce 1331 = Bernardini, Vasi dello stile di Gnathia , pl. 53,5-6 and Delli Ponti in Archeologia in Puglia : Lecce , p. 50, fig. 70), the upper part of whose naked body projects outwards from the vase itself, which is in the shape of a bird. Another example of the combination of relief decoration with red-figure can be found in an oenochoe of shape 10 in the Moonen collection in Emblem (Belgium), where a diademed female head is applied to the surface of the body of the vase between two crouching nude women (Genava 38, 1 990, p. 84, fig. 3d); this vase is somewhat later in date and nearer in shape to the corresponding oenochoai of the Menzies Group and in style to the work of the Baltimore Painter (no. 27/219-1 below).

I, pp. 111-127 Corrigenda The bell-krater once on the London Market (Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 16 June 1975, no. 188), which was attributed in RVAp II (p. 655) to the Magnini Sub-group as no. 22/61, is now seen to be by the same hand as Malibu 71 AE 301 and 302 (nos. 22/76 and 78) and should therefore be transferred to the Malibu Painter. The plate in Poznan (new no. A 3; old no. 1903.608 = CV A Poland 3, pl. 4,5), previously known to us only from the illustration in the CV A , was placed in RVAp II, p. 698, no. 22/609, along with two plates in Copenhagen which, from the CV A reproduction, it seemed to resemble. Thanks to a new and much better photograph, kindly supplied by Dr. Jan Szymkiewicz, we now see it as by the same painter as no. 163 and to go closely with nos. 163a-c below. The stemless cup Boston 19.308 (no. 22/426, p. 682) should more properly be regarded as Paestan; see The red-figured Vases of Paestum, p. 227, no. 2/883, pl. 143f. The volute-krater, once on the Basel market, listed in Suppl. I on p. 1 12 as possibly belonging to the Chevron Group (no. 8b), is now seen to be closer in style to the Strötgen Painter and has therefore been transferred to Chapter 17 as no. 20-7 (see above, p. 114).

(vii) The Salapia-San Severo Sub-group It should be noted that some vases which correspond closely to the descriptions of the bell-kraters from T. 1 85 at Salapia have recently appeared upon the market. As it has not been possible to obtain photographs of the vases from T. 185, other than those published in RVAp II, pl. 244,5-8 (Foggia 131487 and 131507), it is difficult to confirm the identity of these vases, but a bell-krater in a private collection in Lausanne corresponds very closely with Foggia 131498 (no. 91) and reference has already been made (p. 205 above; nos. 64-2 and 3) to two bell-kraters recently on the New York market, which might well be Foggia 131510 and 131535 (nos. 92 and 95). The pattern-work on the two last, however, is not the same as that on nos. 90, 91 and 94 and the style is nearer to that of the Magnini Šub-group. Another bell-krater, recently on the French market (Nantes, sale of 23 May 1990, no. 38; St. Jean-de-Luz, sale of 14 July 1990 = Gazette de V Hôtel Drouot , vol. 99, no. 19, 1 1 May 1990, ill. on p. 167 and no. 27, 6 July 1990, ill. on p. 74), might also belong here. The obverse shows a woman seated to left, with her head turned to right, holding a cista in her right hand and a fan in her left, and the reverse (unpublished) a female head; the pattern below the picture on the obverse is the same as that on no. 94 (Foggia 131507). The vase was later with Mythes et Légendes, Cat. 24, no. 4997 (ill.). 2. Connected Vases NOTE.

Both have a band of chevrons below the rim and might well have been placed in the Chevron Group, except for their close affinity to nos. 144ff.

It is now clear that Poznan 1903.698 (no. 22/609) belongs to this group, which is also associated with the work of the Painter of B.M.

The hair is tied up in a kekryphalos , decorated with a row of black strokes at the top, from which emerges a bunch of black hair. One of the lids on the Würzburg kemos is also decorated with a female head of rather cruder style, which suggests a fairly late date for the group.

The Ascoli Satriano Painter and associated Vases Several new vases by this painter, which have only recently come to light, represent mythological subjects of some interest, especially no. 878b, with the liberation of Prometheus. Mostly, however, only stock subjects are depicted, among which the figure of Eros seated upon a hollow rock (as on nos. 858, 883-5, 887-9, 891) is by far the most popular (nos. 878c, 884b, 885b-c). The new material also provides further evidence about the later work of this painter and that of some other artists closely associated with him at the end of his career. (ii) Vases with figured scenes Oenochoai (shape 2) 878a Geneva HR 76. PdDy pp. 201-3, ills, on p. 202. Youthful Herakles, with lion-skin and club, confronting centaur, holding a tree in his r. hand, with a woman seated on his back. The scene, as Vollkommer points out {Herakles, p. 28, no. 196), probably depicts the confrontation between Herakles and the centaur Nessos before the latter sets off over the river with Deianira on his back. *878b Princeton, University Art Museum 1989.30. Plate LVII, 1 The liberation of Prometheus - Herakles, with lion-skin and club, drawing his bow, Pan with kantharos and wreath, fettered Prometheus, bird (eagle ?) flying above altar. For another version of the subject cf. Berlin 1969.9 {RVAp II, p. 476, no. 18/6). The wound on the chest of Prometheus, caused by the eagle's attacks, is clearly indicated. 878c Once Paris Market, Galerie Mythes et Légendes. Cat. XVIII, no. 3748 (ill.).

The figures on no. 885a are very typical of the painter (cf. nos. 880, 880a and 891); the framing palmettes clearly indicate the influence of Paestan. *885a Once Zurich Market, Galerie Fortuna C 141 1.

Plate L /11,4 Int.: In the tondo is a figure of Eros, with outstretched arms, holding a phiale and a fillet in his r. hand, moving to r. Around the tondo are six animals - three griffins, a lion and two panthers (cf. no. 864). Ext.: A. Seated Eros holding looped fillet. B. Seated Eros with bead-wreath and phiale. The animals round the tondo on this vase and on no. 864 find a parallel in the griffin, boar and lion represented on the lid of a cylindrical pyxis at one time on the New York market in the Royal-Athena Galleries (PBR 01; Art of the Ancient World VI, 1 (1990), no. 1 16, ill. on p. 32), which might well also belong here. (iii) Later Work In Suppl. I, p. 1 27, the hydria now in the Geddes collection in Melbourne (A 5:5), was placed in division (ii) of the painter's work. It is now seen to be by the same hand as the two amphorae in the Guarini collection in Pulsano (Ant. Coll. G., pp. 75-6, nos. 23-4, pls. 89-90, which were there attributed to the Lampas Painter). The connection between that artist and the Ascoli Satriano Painter is referred to in PdD , p. 203, both being what may be termed "provincial" painters, who stand somewhat apart from the main stream of Apulian vase-painting. The Guarini amphorae are, however, not by the Lampas Painter but look to be later work by the Ascoli Satriano Painter, leading on to the Mattinata and Müller Painters in Chapter 30. The two lekanides in Oxford (nos. 890a and b) mark the transition from what may be called the artist's standard style to that of his later period, where the drawing is less careful and the drapery tends to have a rather "scrappy" look. Note the similarity between the flat meanders on the Geddes hydria (now renumbered 893) and those on nos. 894 and 897. Hydria *893 Melbourne, Geddes coll. A 5:5. Plate LVII, 5 Suppl.

This vase has been extensively repainted, but it is either a late work by the painter himself or else by a close imitator. (iv) By late followers The three following vases look to be by later followers of the Ascoli Satriano Painter, they have a very "provincial" appearance and are connected with the work of the Mattinata Painter, with which they must be contemporary.

I, pp. 128-133 Bibliography An article by Stefania Caranti Martignano entitled "Quattro vasi del Pittore della Patera" appeared in II Carobbio 5, 1979, pp. 62-70. It deals with the two volute-kraters Bologna 567 and 568 and the two column-kraters 577 and 579, all of which are illustrated, although the four obverses are printed in reverse. Corrigenda The amphora listed on p. 131 of Suppl. I (once Paris Market, Galerie Mythes et Légendes, Cat. 12, no. 2499) has on its reverse two youths (and not two women, as there stated). It should therefore be transferred to division (i) and renumbered as 3d. Page 735, no. 56. This vase, now in a private collection in Seraing (inv. 214) is not a barrel-amphora, but a loutrophoros Type H, of which the handles are missing. Traces of them remain where they were attached to the shoulder. Page 735, no. 56a. This vase later appeared on the London market at Sotheby's ( Sale Cat. 1 1 July 1988, no. 177, ill. on p. 112) and is now in the Geddes collection in Melbourne (A 1 :25). It is identical with Suppl. I, p. 155, no. 27/45b, and should therefore be transferred to the Baltimore Painter. Page 745, no. 154. Malibu 77 AE 1 16. Perhaps not by the painter's own hand, but very close to his work. See CV A 3, pp. 17-18, pls. 152-3. Page 761, no. 277 should be a loutrophoros, not an amphora. Suppl. I, page 131. The reverse of no. 100b represents two women and not two youths, so the vase rightly belongs to division (i).

In the light, however, of the Apollo/Artemis hydria (no. 17-3 below), it now looks as if both these hydriai are by the hand of the Ganymede Painter and they should be transferred to the list of his works as nos. 25/17,1-2 below.

As mentioned above, the Actaeon situla and the Niobe hydria, listed in RVAp and Suppl.

The treatment of the figures surrounding the naiskos on the body of the Sciclounoff hydria leaves no doubt about its attribution to the Ganymede Painter. The two hydriai are now placed in a new sub-division (a), the others, with naiskos scenes, are placed in (b), the Sciclounoff hydria providing a connecting link between them.

The following vase, as Dr. Söldner points out ( CV A , Bonn 3, Text, p. 58), is very close in style to the work of the Ganymede Painter and may well be by his own hand. The treatment of the wings of Eros finds a good parallel on the reverse of no. 35 (= PI. 297,5), on the exterior of no. 47 and on no. 56, and the rock on which he is seated is also very typical of those on other vases by the Ganymede Painter (e.g. nos. 14, 24, 25a, 57; cf. also with that on no. 51a below). 246</page><page sequence="76">CHAPTER 25 Oenochoe (shape 1) 42a Bonn 1 1 2.

I, pp. 146-168 Bibliography There have been numerous recent articles about the Baltimore Painter and his associates (see Biblio- graphy in Part I, p. xv) and the following deal in particular with his work, as well as including illustrations of many of his vases. P.E. Arias, "Un nuovo cratere apulo del Pittore di Baltimora", in Rend Pont Acc 53-4, 1980-82 (1984), pp. 69-90. K. Schauenburg, "Baltimoremaler und Bellerophon", in Jb.

Many vases by, or close to, the Stoke-on-Trent Painter are listed and illustrated in Luisa Rossi's article "Ritrovamenti sulla strada Canosa-Ofanto", in Canosa II (Studi suli' antico 6, Dedalo, Bari, 1983), pp. 7-61, and pls. XVII-XXI. Corrigenda Malibu 77 AE 16,1 (RVAp II, p. 870, no. 27/49a) was probably a loutrophoros (Type II) rather than a barrel-amphora (Type III), as parts of its handles have now been identified (CV A 4, pl. 206,1-2 and accompanying entry in the text). RVAp n, p. 876: the lekanis lid no. 27/109 should be Louvre K 200 (not 401). Nos. 27/17, 26, 57a and 60 were transferred from the Baltimore to the White Saccos Painter in Suppl. I, pp. 147-9 and 182.

Introduction Since the publication of Supplement I in 1983, nearly 250 new vases, either by the Baltimore Painter himself or else closely associated with him in style (i.e. products of his workshop), have come to our notice; of these about 100 may be regarded as major works (i.e. with mythological or funeraiy scenes), the remainder being mostly of smaller dimensions and less significance. There have also been several studies of the painter and his work, of which the articles by L. Todiseo and K. Schauenburg, listed in the bibliography at the beginning of this chapter, are of particular importance. The latest of Schauenburg^ articles (Jdl 105, 1990, pp. 67-94) deals in particular with the six vases by the 267</page><page sequence="97">THE BALTIMORE PAINTER AND ASSOCIATES Baltimore Painter (two volute-kraters = nos. 9b and c; two loutrophoroi = nos. 43-1 and 2; and two hydriai = nos. 53e and f) which formed part of a tomb-group that also included a set of bronze armour (helmet, cuirass and greaves) and some horse-trappings. The whole complex is discussed by David Cahn in Waffen und Zaumzeug (no. W 23a-j; pp. 38-53), the catalogue of an exhibition held in the Antikenmuseum und Sammlung Ludwig in Basel in 1989, with illustrations of all the items except the two hydriai, which do not seem to have been included. The new material has also shed further light on the connections between the work of the Baltimore Painter and that of his close follower, the White Saccos Painter (see below, Chapter 29; also GVBt p. 94). Most of the subjects depicted upon the new vases are already familiar to us: Amphiaraos in the Underworld (see H. Lohmann, in Boreas 9, 1986, pp. 65-82) reappears on several vases (e.g. nos. 22al-3); the adjudication of Adonis (nos. 23f and g) is a new theme, so is the death of Hippolytos (no. 23h) for this painter. The elaborate ornamental pattern- work, which is such a notable feature of the Baltimore Painter's vases (see RVAp , pp. 858-9) now finds a further parallel in the pebble mosaic floor from Pella, published by M. Lilimbaki-Akamati in AMHTOI {Festschrift Andronikos, 1987), p. 456, fig. 1. The characteristic features of the Baltimore Painter's mature style, as set out in RVAp , p. 859, will be seen on most of the larger vases listed below. Schauenburg, in GVB&gt; deals extensively with his treatment of naiskos scenes and of the objects that appear in them. We may perhaps note in passing that the rather curiously shaped fan, held by the women seated in the naiskoi on nos. 54 and 55 (RVAp, pl. 33 1 , 1 -2), reappears on several of the new vases (e.g. nos. 9b, 13a, 13c, 48e-f and i, 53c, e, f, 1, 67c, 81h and j, 135a); in this particular form it seems to be peculiar to the Baltimore Painter (see also GVB , pp. 70-71). The numerous smaller vases follow closely upon those listed in RVAp , pp. 882-5 and Suppl. I, pp. 160-162. Some may well be minor works by the painter himself, but for the most part they must be regarded as workshop pieces by artists who closely copied their master's style but did not attempt larger compositions. The heads which appear on the lids of some of the mugs, like those on the necks (or, at times, feet) of volute-kraters, are often either by the Stoke-on-Trent Painter (see RVAp , pp. 859 and 885) or one of his close followers. Additions to the Vase-lists 1. The Baltimore Painter (i) Larger Vases Volute-kraters (a) With naiskos scenes on the obverse The new vases almost double the existing number of volute-kraters with naiskos scenes which may be attributed to the Baltimore Painter. They all conform closely to the various models provided by the vases already attributed to the painter in RVAp II, pp. 860-3 and Suppl . I, p. 149 and add little that is new to our knowledge of his work. The number of figures in the naiskos ranges from 1 (nos. 8b and c), sometimes together with, or riding on, a horse (nos. 3a and 4a), to 4 (no. 1 3c), and they are treated in the standard manner with a good deal of added red and shades of yellow for details and accessories. The reverses depict either stele scenes, normally with four figures (nos. 3a, 4a, 8b, 1 le, 1 lg-i, 13a), but sometimes with only two (no. 8c), or else a naiskos, with either a woman (nos. 9b and c), or a youth (no. 1 lb) in red figure, the latter once in added white (no. 1 la), and quite frequently a flowering plant (nos. 9d, 1 ld-f, 13b). The necks on the obverses mostly represent female heads in added white in a floral setting; no. 11a has a diademed head of Aphrodite, flanked by Erotes, who hold a piece of dark red drapery behind it; nos. 1 lb and 13a represent 268</page><page sequence="98">CHAPTER 27 only Erotes; only two have figured scenes without a floral background, no. 1 li with Nike driving a quadriga and no. 1 3c with an Amazonomachy (cf. nos. 11-13). On the reverses there is often a palmette composition, sometimes (as on nos. 9b-c, 1 lb, 1 ld-f, 1 lh-i, 13c) with a r.f. female head in the centre, associated in style with those by the Stoke-on-Trent Painter. Similar heads also appear on the feet of nos. 1 If and 13c; on the foot of no. 1 lg there is a wreath of vine-leaves in added white. Only on no. Ila (cf. no. 22a3) do figures appear on the blinkers (kneeling Erotes), although scroll-work or floral patterns will be found on the handles of nos. 8c, 1 1 h and i. The plastic scroll- work decoration on the handle of no. 3a, below the rim, is exceptional. *3a Once London Market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 17-18 July 1985, no. 348, with colour-ill.

Cf. with nos. 29/1-2 by the White Saccos Painter. (b) With mythological scenes on the obverse The sixteen new volute-kraters with mythological subjects, two of which have survived only in fragmentary form (nos. 3 la-b), come mainly from the Baltimore Painter's more mature period and nearly all of them are large vases, often over 80 cm. in height. They are elaborately decorated with multi-figured mythological compositions on the obverses and usually with naiskos scenes on the reverses, with normally 4 or 6 supporting figures; the stele scene on the reverse of no. 14e is an exception. There are often figured scenes on the necks as well, though on the reverse a profile female head in r.f. amid scrolls and palmettes is more usual. The feet are also sometimes decorated in similar fashion (e.g. nos. 22/2, 22a- 1, 23f) or in two instances (nos. 23e and g) with a wreath of berried laurel. Only once do figures appear on the blinkers (no. 22a3), though scroll-work will be found on the handles of nos. 21c, 22-2, 22a4. Of particular interest is the frieze of heads (alternately winged and white, and r.f. without wings) above the figured scene on the neck of no. 23g, since similar heads appear on a number of the later vases (cf. no. 31a), and there is a comparable row on the neck of no. 23a ( Suppl . I, p. 1 52). Most of the subjects represented on the vases below are already familiar to us from the painter's previously published vases - the assembly of gods above, with an Amazonomachy below (nos. 14e and f) finds parallels on nos. 14, 14a and 15; Amphiaraos before Pluto in the underworld (nos. 22al-3) on nos. 17, 19, 23a, with an interesting variation on no. 22a4 in which Pluto is replaced by Persephone (see Schauenburg, AA 1990, pp. 9 Iff, esp. pp. 97-9); Pluto carrying off Persephone (no. 22a3), as on no. 57; scenes with Achilles (no. 23e), as on nos. 20, 23d, 25-6, and Bellerophon (nos. 22-1 and 2), as on no. 22. New to the Baltimore Painter and of particular interest is the adjudication of Adonis on nos. 23f and g (cf. New York 1 1.210.3, no. 18/20 by the Darius Painter), on both of which he is shown standing before Zeus, who is seated on a throne, holding a sceptre in his hand, with Aphrodite on the left, Persephone on the right and Hermes in between. On no. 23g Iris appears as well, behind Persephone. No. 14g gives a spirited version of a youthful Herakles grappling with the horses of Diomede, and no. 23h of the death of Hippolytos, who is shown in his chariot by the shore of the sea, represented by a leaping dolphin, from the waves of which emerges a white bull, incited by a Fury with a whip (see Schauenburg, AA 1990, p. 95 and figs. 7-8). The presence in the scene of a tripod on top of an Ionic column suggests a connection with a successful dramatic performance. 14e Once New York Market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 20 June 1990, no. 74 (ill.); ex Royal-Athena Galleries SLY 48 and London Market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 17-18 July 1985, no. 346 (ill.) and 22 May 1989, no. 188, ill. on p. 55.

Amphorae In RVAp II (pp. 867-8) the amphorae by the Baltimore Painter were not, as was the case with the volute-kraters, formally divided into two groups with (a) naiskos and (b) mythological scenes depicted upon them. The former mostly appeared together as nos. 35-39 (with no. 39a in Suppl. I on p. 153); nos. 40, 40a and b (in Suppl. I) represented mythological scenes; no. 41, with a naiskos containing three figures, was placed for stylistic reasons beside no. 40 and was followed by nos. 42-43, both with naiskos scenes. The appearance of a large number of new amphorae, all with representations of naiskoi, suggests that it is probably better to keep the two groups separate, and these vases have been placed in division (a), mostly with serial numbers following on from 39a, while those with mythological subjects are in division (b) with numbers from 40c onwards. Significant is the appearance of several amphorae with a single figure in the naiskos but with four figures on either side of it and on the reverse (nos. 39b-l), a type not previously recorded, since no. 42 contains two figures in what looks to be a building rather than a naiskos, as it has four free-standing columns.

Smaller Vases from the Baltimore Painter's workshop It is difficult to draw a hard and fast dividing line between the smaller vases which may be by the Baltimore Painter himself and those which are workshop products, since his associates are extremely well drilled and imitate the work of their master very closely. The drawing of the faces, however, is often not in complete accord with the painter's own manner (e.g. on nos. 177a-b, 178e-f, 179b, 182c, etc.), and the female heads on the lids of the mugs (e.g. nos. 184-12 and 13) often look to be by one of the associates of the Stoke-on-Trent Painter rather than his own work.

Plastic female head wearing diadem with pendant, between two crouching naked women, 1. holding branch, r. with mirror and phiale. Reference has already been made to this vase in connection with the pelike Geneva 27800 (see above, no. 2 l/94b), but it stands rather by itself with no close parallel. The plastic head projects some distance outward from the body of the vase and is covered with a brownish wash (diluted glaze ?); the decoration on the diadem is in black glaze, as is that on the bead pendant which adorns the brow. The crouching female figures on either side are related in style to the minor vases by the Baltimore Painter. 296</page><page sequence="126">CHAPTER 27 3. Vases linking the Baltimore and Stoke-on-Trent Painters On all the vases listed below there is a figured scene by the Baltimore Painter combined with a female head (usually on the reverses of larger vases or on the lids of mugs) by the Stoke-on-Trent Painter. Oenochoai shape 8B are listed here when the head is obviously by the latter artist; female heads are also to be found on several other vases of this shape - see above under section l(iv) and 2(i) - but on most of these the head is by an associate of the Stoke-on-Trent Painter and not by the painter himself.

The Stoke-on-Trent Painter Many new vases, especially plates, oenochoai of shape 1, and kantharoi decorated with female heads in the characteristic style of the Stoke-on-Trent Painter, have come to light in recent years, as well as a number which strongly reflect his influence and are probably workshop pieces. These vases not infrequently appear on the market (often without illustrations in the Sale Catalogues), whence they pass into the hands of dealers and private collectors, only to reappear on the market at a later date. It is extremely difficult to keep track of such vases, especially when they are unillustrated or when a catalogue publishes one side only, the other being illustrated subsequently by itself in a different context. It is, therefore, not unlikely that some of the vases listed below may have already been included in RVAp II or Supplement I, though we have done our best to avoid such repetitions. Some of the smaller vases listed below may well be the work of close followers. Amphora 250d Göttingen Hu 58 1 . CVA 1, pl. 12,1-3.

Smaller vases (especially lekanides) closely connected with the Stoke-on-Trent Painter The V.-T. (= Varrese-Toppicelli) Group In her article 'Ritrovamenti sulla strada Canosa-Ofanto" in Canosa H, pp. 7-61, Luisa Rossi refers to a number of vases either by, or closely associated in style with, the Stoke-on-Trent Painter. Her further researches in the 'deposito" at Taranto have brought to light several handleless lekanides, which look to be by the same hand as Bari 23540 from the Contrada Toppicelli ( Canosa II, pl. XVIII, 1-2) and these she has grouped together and discussed in an article entitled 'Un nuovo ceramografo canosino: il Pittore delle Pissidi Varrese-ToppicellTìn Arch. Class. 38-40, 1986-88, pp. 27-34, pls. IV-XVm. All the Taranto material comes from the Varíese hypogeum in Canosa and passed into the Museum in 1912, but has not been on exhibition for many years. Around the Varrese-Toppicelli vases may be grouped a number of others, mostly, like them, lekanides without handles, which she calls 't)issidi"in Italian, although in English the word '{&gt;yxis"is used to describe a very different shape. They may well be the woik of a single hand, but there are several minor 303</page><page sequence="133">THE BALTIMORE PAINTER AND ASSOCIATES variations in treatment, e.g. of the eyes and mouth, and in the decorative pattern flanking the heads, so it is perhaps safest to put them together as the V.-T.

Perhaps also here should be placed a lidded mug, known to us only from the illustration in the Sale Catalogue , on the lid of which (possibly not belonging to it) is a female head very like those on nos. 495-6 and the two above.

(b)(i) From nos. 495-6, 495a, 496a there develops a sub-group decorated with female heads which, at the start, are very close to those on the four vases referred to, but on which the quality of the drawing undergoes a rapid deterioration. The treatment of the back hair, which develops from that on no. 496a, is characteristic; it appears as a solid black mass, slightly piriform in shape, with a reserved contour. The kekryphalos is decorated with thick white stripes. Between the heads are palmette-fans, not enclosed, often with two large white dots flanking the central leaf, and a white dot in the centre of the reserved core, which may also be outlined in white (as on no. 496-1).

(v) The Group of the Hamburg Askos Pyxis lid 514a Bari, Marotti coll. 18. Very close to no. 510. (vi) The Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand So many new vases by, or closely related to, this painter have come to light in recent years that it now seems advisable to reclassify his work as a whole and to renumber the vases from 515 onwards, placing the old numbers ( RVAp II, pp. 904-5 and Suppl. I, pp. 167-8) in brackets beside the new ones, where the latter have been changed. Most of the new vases well illustrate the essential characteristics of the work of this painter, among which we should note (a) the use of a white high-light in the eyes, (b) the curved line at the base of the nostril, (b) the downward turn of the mouth with dots or dot-clusters above it, (d) the appearance of a hollow rock, outlined in white and tapering towards the top, on which figures are frequently seated, (e) an abundant use of added white for details and adjuncts. In his later phase the quality of the drawing deteriorates and the pupil of the eye increases considerably in size. The list which follows incorporates the vases already recorded in RVAp II and Supplementi , but without detailed descriptions, and adds the new vases in their appropriate places. 313</page><page sequence="143">THE BALTIMORE PAINTER AND ASSOCIATES (a) Stand 5 1 5 (5 1 5) Bari, Macinagrossa coll. 52.

The female heads on the lower register of no. 568 or on the reverse of no. 569 are clearly by the hand of this artist; the other figures find parallels on nos. 516-21 above.

(vii) Vases associated with the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand (a) The Samarcande Group The vases in this group have only recently come to our notice. Two of the volute-kraters (nos. 575-6) were published by Schauenburg in Jdl 102, 1987, pp. 199-201, figs. 1-5, who rightly noted their connection with the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand and also with the Virginia Exhibition Painter (see below, p. 332), as may clearly be seen in the treatment of the base of the naiskos, where a band of decorative pattern-work (key; zig-zag) runs between two black stripes with white dots running along them (as on nos. 28/86a-d in Suppl. I and nos. 86-1 and 4 below). The heads on these vases, however, differ from those by the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand in having no dots near the mouth, which with the short vertical stroke at the end has the appearance of a T on its side (cf. the Stoke-on-Trent Painter and no. 522). The transition from the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand is well-exemplified in no. 574 below, which, while exhibiting many of the characteristics of that painter, has a head on the reverse which differs from his and is nearer to those in the Samarcande Group. 318</page><page sequence="148">CHAPTER 27 (a) Transitional The two following volute-kraters seem to mark the transition from the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand to the Samarcande Painter. The first (no. 573) is nearer to the former, especially in regard to its reverse, but it has suffered a good deal at the hands of the restorer. The rendering of the drapery, however, is close to that on no. 574, as is also the pattern-work and the floral decoration on the neck of the obverse.

Plate LXXXI, 1-2 (a) Two Nikai, 1. with situla and alabastron, r. with wreath in each hand, at a naiskos in which is a flowering plant, (b) female head to 1., wearing saccos. Neck: (a) white female head in three-quarter view to r., in floral setting. Masks: (a) yellow hair and white faces, (b) darker hair and red faces. The masks go closely with those on no. 518 and the white scrolls flanking the head with those on nos. 520-521, and 570. For the Nikai on the obverse, cf. the seated Nike on no. 529 and the two women on the reverse of no. 573; for the head on the reverse those on no. 525 and on the shoulder of no. 527, where the treatment of the saccos is very similar. Here it is decorated with a series of ornamental bands, white between black stripes, black with white dots, white key-pattern on a black background, zig-zag, strokes with a row of white dots between them, white between two black bands, and the top in white. Such elaborate decoration looks back to that on vases like nos. 51 5, 519, etc. and the extensive use of added white is characteristic. A similar treatment is to be found on the vases in the next sub-division. (ß) The vases in this sub-division are the work of a single painter, who has a neat and uniform style. The female heads on his reverses all wear a kekryphalos , with a large bunch of curly hair emerging at the back, tied round by a ribbon or fillet. There is a row of white beads across the hair above the forehead, or a white line, a radiate Stephane with tall spikes, and bands of decoration on the head-dress, with a good deal of added white. The earrings often take the form of a half-circle with a pendant below. Rosettes and phialai appear in the field. Volute-kraters 575 Once Rome Market. Schauenburg, J d! 102, 1987, p. 201, figs. 4-5.

Body: (a) and (b) Female head. Lid: below - female head; above - head of Nike. The lid of this vase is of a most unusual shape; it has a knob, from which rises what looks like a small barrel-amphora, with shoulder, neck and open mouth. The barrel -amphora section is decorated with a head of Nike and rosettes, there are rosettes on the shoulder, white strokes on the neck. The head on the body of the lebes gamikos is close in style to those by the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand, the mouth having a downward turn (as on nos. 533-5, 539, 557, 568), but without any of the characteristic dots on either side. The earring has the typical half-circle over pendant (ivy-leaf) form as on nos. 515, 539, 542-3, 546-7, etc.), and this head might well be the painter's own work; the head on the upper part of the lid is, however, rather different in style and less carefully drawn.

The Painter of Berlin F 3383 and associated Vases (i) The Painter of Berlin F 3383 Introduction The many new vases attributed to this painter which have come to our notice since the publication of Supplement I call for a certain measure of reappraisal of his work. In this regard the two volute-kraters listed as nos. 63a and b on p. 1 7 1 of Suppl. I are of particular interest and importance. They were originally known to us only from rather inferior photographs of various details, which showed them to be a matching pair, and perhaps by the Painter of Berlin F 3383. Since then the two vases have reappeared on the market and were 327</page><page sequence="157">FOLLOWERS OF THE PATERA AND BALTIMORE PAINTERS the subject of a detailed study by Konrad Schauenburg, "Zur zwei Krateren des Malers von Berlin F 3383", in Festschrift Himmelmann (1989), pp. 215-219, with illustrations on pl. 38. To these two may now be added two more (Chicago 1984.8 and San Diego, Higgie coll. 100), which are clearly by the same artist and combine with them to make a very closely-related group of four. A further two, also very similar in style, but with a different treatment of the reverses, now in a private collection in Oreye (Belgium), may be added to the group. A study of all the six vases shows them to be not by the Painter of Berlin F 3383 but to belong to the Stuttgart Group in the workshop of the White Saccos Painter ( RVAp H, pp. 978ff.). This might have been apparent from the use of the dot-edged rosettes, commonly found on vases in that Group (e.g. nos. 29/204-6, 209, 211,217), above the neck-panels on the two volute-kraters listed as nos. 63a and b, but becomes quite clear from a study of the whole group of six, especially from the white saccoi worn by the two women on the obverse of the krater in the Higgie collection (PI. XCIX,3) or from the drawing of the torso of the nude seated youth above to right on the same vase. The two kraters, formerly listed as nos. 63a and b (Suppl. I, p. 171) have therefore been transferred to the Stuttgart Group and the other four added to them. The matter is discussed in greater detail below on p. 364. The new material adds more than twenty major vases to the list of the painter's works and thus enables us to make a fuller study of his artistic development. Most of the stock features of his style (see RVAp , pp. 9 1 7f.) are repeated on the new vases, on which we again see his typical treatment of drapery (well defined fold-lines, often in groups of two; parallel fold-lines on the arcs between the breasts; beaded girdles, etc.). Noteworthy also is his rendering of the draped youths on his reverses; on two occasions (nos. 63f and g) they appear with a draped woman in between them, but more usually by themselves with a diptych in the field above (nos. 64c, 67d, as on nos. 63e, 64), though this is sometimes held in the hand of the youth to right (e.g. nos. 64a, e and f, as on no. 63). The youths find parallels on vases by the Painter of the Macinagrossa Stand (e.g. nos. 27/568 = old no. 516, 570-1) and lead directly on to those by the Arpi Painter (as on no. 28/94), but are rather more suavely drawn (cf. no. 67d); they invariably wear white head-bands. Another popular theme for the reverse is a group of two or four figures disposed around a stele, the base of which is often decorated with a black palmette-fan with side-scrolls, sometimes in white (e.g. nos. 60a, 67b, 69c-d; as on nos. 63d, 69, 69a). Apart from naiskos scenes, a favourite subject for obverses consists of a seated woman and a youth, sometimes with a small figure of Eros flying towards one or the other (cf. nos. 64a-c and g; as on no. 64). The "apple-tree" on no. 64b is repeated on no. 67e; the pattern on the shield on no. 62a is repeated from no. 67. Noteworthy also is the way in which figures tend slightly to emerge from the naiskos - nos. 63f and g are particularly good examples, on no. 67b the youth stands almost completely outside it. Another often repeated object is the rather curious-looking mirror with a solid white disk, a handle below, and a cross on the top; this may be seen in the right hand of the woman beside the naiskos on Naples 2242 (no. 28/67, pl. 355,3) and is repeated on nos. 60a, 64a, 67b, 70b. The close stylistic relationship between the Painter of Berlin F 3383 and the Arpi Painter has already been mentioned. This is particularly clear on a vase like no. 28/63d {Suppl. I, p. 171, pl. XXXII, 1-2) and also on nos. 60a, 67b and c; it may be noted that the saltire square, with a hollow triangle in each of the four divisions, which is frequently used by the Arpi Painter, is also to be found on nos. 63f and g, 67b and c. Wave-pattern also appears frequently below the pictures - e.g. on nos. 64a-g, 67e, 69c-d; as on nos. 58, 58a, 63, 63e, 64-66, 68-9, 70. The new vases add nothing of interest to the subjects represented, since the painter seems to have little taste for depicting mythology, the San Antonio plate (Suppl. I, no. 73a), with the judgement of Paris, being almost his only venture into this area. Loutrophoros (Type HI) = Barrel amphora *60a German private coll.

These lead up to the slightly later and worse vases associated with the Bari Andromeda Group like B.M. F 408 (no. 28/1 12); see below, p. 339. 3A. The Virginia Exhibition Painter SuppL I, pp. 173-4 The larger vases by this painter {Cat. V.E. , nos. 73-77; Suppl. I, nos. 28/86a-e) were on display in the grand hall of Albemarle House (near Charlottesville, Va.), the property of their owner, and the volute-krater no. 28/8ÓC {Suppl. I, pl. XXXIII, 3) appears in an illustration in an article on the house in Town and Country , Nov. 1987, p. 273. Since the publication of Suppl. I, it has come to our notice that five other vases were found in the same tomb as those attributed on pp. 173-4 to the Virginia Exhibition Painter (nos. 28/86a-e). One of these was listed in Suppl. I on p. 190 as no. 29/280c, where it was grouped with two other kantharoi and associated with the White Saccos -Stuttgart Group. The latter two, both at one time on the Rome market, are now seen to go closely with Kiel B 582-3 (nos. 86-17 and 18 below) and have therefore been transferred to this section as nos. 19 and 20; the first remains where it was originally placed and is joined by a number of other vases very close to it (see below p. 371). They well illustrate the connection between the vases associated with the Virginia Exhibition Painter and those of the White Saccos -Kantharos Group. Among the new vases is a series of tall-necked oenochoai (shape 1), in which the upper part of the neck, including the mouth, and the handles are covered with a white slip; on no. 86-5 this also covers the shoulder and the upper part of the body. The white slip is sometimes (as on no. 86-9) enlivened with a light blue wash. The same blue, with pink as well, is used for the acanthus plants which serve as the knobs on the lids of some of the mugs (e.g. nos. 86-10 to 12 and 14). In the figured scenes several elements are repeated from his already listed vases (nos. 86a-e), notably the tambourine with loops and curly ribbons (as on nos. 86a and c), the thyrsus (as on nos. 86a-c), the flanking flowers (as on the reverses of nos. 86c-e). The new vases are numbered from 86-1 onwards to avoid confusion with the existing ones. (i) Volute-kraters *86-1 Once New York Market, Almagià.

These four vases make a compact group; all have handles, painted white, in the form of a hollow spiralling volute rising high above the lip of the mouth. There are spurs at both the upper and lower handle-joins, and the band below the pictures is painted white. It will be noted that there is a considerable difference between these kantharoi and those listed below in Chapter 29, section 3(i)a (pp. 371-2), on which the heads are more closely associated with those by the White Saccos Painter or in the Kantharos Group. In Suppl. I (p. 190) the two kantharoi once on the Roman market were erroneously placed in Chapter 29 as nos. 280a-b, but it is now clear that they would more correctly be associated with the two kantharoi in Kiel. On the four kantharoi listed above the pictures on both sides are framed by white Ionic columns. It may be noted that on the back hair of the women's heads there is a white cross, which links these vases to those in the White Cross Group - section 3C below. 334</page><page sequence="164">CHAPTER 28 (C) Oenochoai (shape 8B) 86-2 1 Once New York Market, Antiquarium Ltd., ex Almagià.

Vases probably associated with the Virginia Exhibition Painter The two following volute-kraters, formerly on the Paris market, are known to us only from photographs of their obverses; they clearly make a matching pair and, from the rendering of the naiskoi and the drawing of the figures in them, they look as if they should find a place in the present context. The floral patterns on the necks, which are very similar on the two vases, may be compared with those on no. 183.

Companion piece to the preceding vase.

Near this volute-krater was originally placed another, also on the Melbourne market, as no. 86-27, but it is now seen to be by the Oldenburg Painter and has been transferred to Chapter 29 as no. 283b (see p. 372 below). 335</page><page sequence="165">FOLLOWERS OF THE PATERA AND BALTIMORE PAINTERS 3C. The White Cross Group This group includes a number of vases, mostly decorated with female heads, associated in style with the Painter of Berlin F 3383 and, more particularly, with the Virginia Exhibition Painter, since we have already noted the white cross which decorates the back hair of the heads on some of the vases connected with him (e.g. nos. 86-13 to 15, 17 to 18 above). They also provide a connecting link with the vases of the Copenhagen Head Group in Section 13 below. On the projecting bunch of hair at the back of the women's heads on no. 28/184 ( RVAp II, p. 815) and nos. 25/1 84a-b (Suppl. I, p. 1 39), there appeared a cross in added white, on no. 1 84b, with a white dot in one of the four intersections. These three vases were then associated with the workshop of the Ganymede Painter and placed near to the Bristol Painter. The recent appearance of more vases with a similar white cross pattern on the back hair, in some cases with a white dot in each of the four intersections, and, in particular, the volute-krater formerly in the Antonovich Gallery in Paris (no. 86-28 below), suggests that these vases would be better placed in the present chapter, since the naiskos scene on the obverse of the Antonovich krater is clearly connected in style with the work of the Virginia Exhibition Painter, as the treatment of the naiskos (cf. with that on no. 86-5 above) indicates, or that of the head in three-quarter view on the neck (cf. with Basel BS 484, no. 86f). The heads on the neck and body of its reverse find parallels also on the vases of the Painter of Berlin F 3383 (e.g. on the necks of the reverses of nos. 63f and g above, or on the reverse of no. 64g), though there the drawing is of slightly higher quality. It may also be noted that the rendering of the eye on old nos. 25/1 84 and 1 84a-b is very different from that on nos. 1 79, 1 8 1 or 1 83 in the same chapter, there the eyebrow is very long, and the upper eyelid meets it at a sharply acute angle (as on RVAp , pl. 304,4-6), which is not the case on the vases listed below, where the drawing of the eye is moving towards the characteristic treatment found on the vases in the Copenhagen Head Group. The heads in the White Cross Group wear a kekryphalos , patterned with black and white stripes and dots, a radiate white Stephane, and there are usually pendant earrings. The eyebrow is clearly defined and the upper eyelid generally consists of two converging lines; the pupil is a black stroke, the lower lid a very short line. At the end of the mouth there are often one or two small black dots. (i) With a white cross with four dots on the back hair. (a) Volute-krater *86-28 Once Paris Market, Galerie Antonovich inv. 928.

The heads on the necks of (a) and on the body of the reverses are very like those on the Antonovich krater, especially in the treatment of the back hair, with white dots in the four intersections of the cross. Note also the rendering of the naiskoi, which show the same decoration (disk flanked by two solid triangles) in the pediment, which runs up on to the band of tongues on the shoulder. The Nike heads on the necks of the obverses are also closely comparable to those on no. 86-28, with the same white areas beside the women's necks. The woman in the naiskos on no. 86-33 is also similar in pose to the one on no. 86-28 and wears comparable drapery. Volute-kraters *86-32 Vienna, private coll. (Dr. W. Hagg).

Later Followers of the Baltimore Painter The following vase, which strongly reflects the influence of the Baltimore Painter, looks close in style to Milan "H.A." 253 (no. 1 17) and is probably by one of that painter's close followers.

Naiskos Vases Volute-kraters The following volute-krater looks to go with nos. 28/362 and 367; noteworthy is the treatment of the hair of the youths in the naiskos, with the row of white dots immediately above the hair on the top of the head (as on nos. 362 and 367).

I, pp. 181-199 (see also pp. 147-8) Bibliography Several of the articles referred to above (p. 262) in the bibliography to Chapter 27 are also relevant here, especially those by Schauenburg on "Unterweltsbilder" (RM 91, 1984, pp. 359-387) and by Todiseo in Xenia 7, 1984, pp. 49-66. Also important is the article by Schauenburg, "Zur Telephossage in Unteritalien" (= Telephossage ), in RM 90, 1983, pp. 339-358, pls. 79-86. This article deals primarily with the Telephos krater ( RVAp II, p. 961 , no. 29/2a), now in the Sciclounoff collection in Geneva, but also illustrates a number of other major vases now associated with the White Saccos Painter. For the vases decorated with female heads (Suppl. I, p. 185) and others from the same Canosan tomb-group, see F. van der Wielen-van Ommeren in OM Leiden 63, 1982, pp. 77-131, especially section VIII "Groupe Funeraire de Canosa", pp. 9 Iff. (= Groupe Funer airé). See also "Un corredo canosino", in Canosa II, pp. 93-1 12, with version in French on pp. 1 13-127. For the relations between the Baltimore and White Saccos Painters, see Suppl. I, pp. 182-3 and the article by Todiseo referred to above. It now seems likely that no. 27/25 (Foggia 132821 = UWB , pl. 96,3) and 27/49a (Malibu 77 AE 16) are also by the White Saccos Painter rather than by the Baltimore Painter. The Toledo volute-krater (no. 27/13) and the two vases in a private (M.C.) collection in Geneva (above nos. 27/1 3d and e) are also very close in style to the White Saccos Painter (cf. especially the head wearing a Phrygian cap on the neck of the obverse). Corrigenda The two volute-kraters listed in Suppl. I, p. 171, as nos. 28/63a and b have now been transferred to the Stuttgart Group below (nos. 200-1 and 2). The cylindrical pyxis originally placed in the Kantharos Group as no. 29/647 has been transferred to Chapter 27 as no. 4801, and the kantharos Amsterdam 1851 (no. 29/910) to the same group as no. 480o.

The White Saccos Painter Introduction The transference to the White Saccos Painter of a group of vases earlier attributed to the Baltimore Painter is discussed in some detail in Suppl. I, pp. 147-9 and 182-3. Since then more than 200 new vases from the White Saccos Group have come to our notice, including over 20 major vases (with both mythological and naiskos scenes) by the painter himself, as well as about 80 smaller ones, of which about half are decorated with female heads in added white or in red-figure. Together with these there are about 100 from the Chariot and Stuttgart Groups or by associated painters, including a series of volute-kraters (nos. 200-1 to 8 below) now seen to belong to the Stuttgart Group, although a couple of them, on rather insufficient evidence, were attributed in Suppl. I (p. 171, nos. 28/63a and b) to the Painter of Berlin F 3383. The connection between the Baltimore and the White Saccos Painters is discussed by Luigi Todiseo in his article in Xenia (7, 1984, pp. 49-66) and further comments will be found in the articles by Schauenburg listed in the Bibliography at the beginning of this chapter. The new vases give us a wider range of mythological subjects than was previously available. Two (Al and A2) provide us with a slightly different version of the Underworld scene on Malibu 77 AE 13 {Suppl. I, no. 29/A), in which Pluto and Persephone sit side by side in their palace, the former with a sceptre, the latter with a cross-bar torch; on the new vase she wears a crown. The denizens of the Underworld are ranged around the palace, as on no. 29/A, though the positions of those on the upper level have been reversed, Hermes now being on the left and Megara with the two Herakleidai on the right. The Rizzon krater (A2) has more elaborate decoration on the upper part of the obverse, with a figured scene on the neck with a female head in a floral setting above it, as well as figures (woman with torch and incense-burner) in added colours on the blinkers cf. no. 29/C). The rape of Chrysippos appears on nos. D3 and D4; Pluto carrying off Persephone on no. El, and Pelops with Hippodamia in the chariot on D5. The scenes all have a good deal in common in the posing of the figures and the rendering of the chariots and the horses. Stock figures from the standard repertory of the White Saccos Painter reappear on all the vases - we may note, in particular, the women wearing white saccoi, either shown frontally (as on nos. Dl, D2, D5, 1) or in profile (nos. Al, Dl-3, D7-8); the youth with the curious petasos (nos. A2, D3, J), the seated woman, 349</page><page sequence="179">THE WHITE SACCOS-KANTHAROS GROUP as on nos. D2 and D6, with her head and face in three-quarter view, or the woman with "trident"-hair (nos. A2, A3, Dl). Likewise many standard objects are frequently repeated - the handled cista (nos. A2-3, D3, D5), the M-handled hydria (nos. Al, A2, D6-8, El), the beribboned tambourine (nos. D2, D5), the incense-burner (nos. A2, D7, 1), or the parasol (nos. D6-8, El). Also of interest are (i) the fountain-house, which appears on nos. D8, El and J, and is clearly modelled on those on nos. 29/B and G ( Suppl . I, pl. 36,1 and pl. 37,1) and (ii) the tomb-monument with a fluted shaft and a pediment on top, the centre of which is painted black (nos. D2, D4, D5, D6); a variant of this, with a flat shaft, appears on no. D3. The bands of fish which divide the two registers on the obverses of nos. D5 and D8 are of interest since they provide a direct connection with the work of the Sansone Painter (see GRFP , p. 143 and pl. 62); likewise the figures on the shoulders of nos. D3 and D8, the upper part of which is female (winged on no. D3, holding a cithara on no. D8), while the lower merges into an acanthus base in a floral setting (cf. nos. 29/124, pl. 380,8 or no. 52a below). The elaborate and colourful naiskos scenes, which the White Saccos Painter seems to prefer for larger vases like nos. 29/1 and 2, reappear on nos. la, 4d, 8-1 to 4, the smaller ones, usually accompanied by a r.f. female head on the reverse on nos. 29/3b-d and 6c-e; on two of the latter (nos. 3e-f) only a female head appears within the naiskos. The heads appear by themselves, either in added white or in red-figure on a large number of minor vases. Nos. 2d2-4 mark the transition between the more elaborate and the simpler style of naiskos vases. On all three there is a single figure in the naiskos on the obverse, and two figures at a stele on the reverse. The feet of nos. 2d3 and 4 are both decorated in added colour with figures of sirens, with outspread wings; on the former, she plays the flute, on the latter she holds a ball on a ribbon. The vase now in Tampa (87.37 = D8) adds a new shape to those used by the White Saccos Painter. It has a tall ovoid body like that of an amphora or a loutrophoros type I, but lacks handles, and in this respect is unique. It is listed by Pascal Le Blond as no. X-4 in his catalogue of vases connected in shape with loutrophoroi. Another interesting feature is the plastic female head, similar to those appearing on the handles of volute-kraters, applied to the centre of the neck on the obverse, so far without parallel on vases of this type. It seems likely that the amphora recently acquired by the World Heritage Museum (no. J below) should also be placed in this general context. It is a very late work and the drawing, probably rather distorted by the restorer, is unusually scrappy, but the decoration includes so many elements common to the White Saccos Painter (e.g. the fountain-house, the M-handled hydriai, the petasos seen from above, the rendering of the drapery over the women's breasts) that it seems better to associate it with his work, rather than place it in Chapter 30, along with other vases by his distant followers. The addition of a substantial number of major works to the list of vases attributed to the White Saccos Painter, as well as the transference to him (see Suppl. I, p. 1 82) of a few previously attributed to the Baltimore Painter, calls for a certain measure of reclassification and some modifications in the existing numbering system, to which, however, we have adhered as closely as seemed practicable. It now seems advisable to divide the larger vases by the White Saccos Painter into four main groups on the basis of the subjects depicted upon them, as follows: (a) with a mythological or genre scene on the obverse and (where applicable) a funerary one on the reverse - this group includes nos. A to H in Suppl. I, pp. 182-3, and also no. 2a in RVAp II, p. 961. (b) with a funerary scene on both sides - normally a naiskos on the obverse and either a naiskos or a stele on the reverse - RVAp II, pp. 961-3, nos. 1, 2 and 4 and Suppl. I, pp. 183-4, nos. 2c, 2d, 4a-c. (c) with a funerary (naiskos) scene on the obverse and a female head on the reverse - RVAp II, pp. 962-3, nos. 3, 5-8; Suppl. I, p. 184, nos. 2e, 2f, 3a, 6a, 6b. (d) with a figured scene on the obverse and the head of a woman or Nike on the reverse - RVAp II, p. 963, nos. 9-13 (oenochoai); Suppl.

A very late Vase Amphora The following amphora, kindly brought to our notice by Dr. Barbara Bohen, Director of the World Heritage Museum of the University of Illinois, looks to be the work of either the White Saccos Painter himself at the very end of his career, or else of a late, but close, imitator. The vase has been recomposed from a number of fragments and there is a good deal of repainting, especially on the faces and the drapery. The youth in front of the chariot on the upper register wears the typical petasos of the White Saccos Painter (as on nos. Al, A2 and D3) and his almost frontal face is closely comparable to those of Laios and Chrysippos on no. D3; the scene at the fountain-house on the lower register is very like those on nos. B and G (. Suppl . I, pls. 36,1 and 37,1) or on the Tampa vase (no. D8 above). There is also an M-handled hydria beside the youth wearing a petasos, as on many of the White Saccos Painter's other vases. The figures on the reverse have been considerably repainted but find parallels with those on other stele scenes (cf. no. 2d3 below). There is also a stylistic connection with the scene in the upper register of B.M. F 278 (no. 28/1 1 8), by a late follower of the Baltimore Painter. 353</page><page sequence="183">THE WHITE SACCOS-KANTHAROS GROUP Amphora (cont.) *J Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois, World Heritage Museum 89.9.22.

The Stuttgart Group In RVAp, Supplement I, p. 171, two volute-kraters, at that time known to us only from rather inferior photographs, which gave only certain details of the vases, were attributed to the Painter of Berlin F 3383 as nos. 63a and b. Since then the two kraters have reappeared on the Swiss market and were published by Schauenburg in Festschrift Himmelmann (1989), pp. 215-9, with illustrations on pl. 38, where the original attribution was followed. Four more volute-kraters, clearly by the same hand, have recently come to light and these show that the attribution given in Suppl. I is not correct and that in fact all six kraters belong to the Stuttgart Group and are the most important vases in it. The two kraters in Chicago and San Diego go so closely with the two on the Swiss market as to make a very compact group of four in which we may note (i) the uniform treatment of the design on the neck of the obverse - Eros in a floral setting - and on the obverse blinkers, (ii) the presence of a black vase (volute-krater or amphora) against the shaft of the stele on the reverse, (iii) the use of a band of rosettes on the neck of the obverse, with the black strokes and small white dots, typical of the Stuttgart Group (see RVAp , p. 978), (iv) the characteristic treatment of the women's drapery. The two kraters in Oreye are close in style, but with some differences in treatment, notably on the necks and reverses; they are, however, clearly the work of the same painter. The palmettes below the handles are almost identical on all the vases. Volute-kraters (a) 200- 1 Once Lugano Market, Donati. RVAp, Suppl.

(b) Of the three volute-kraters in this sub-division the obverses closely follow the pattern of the preceding four, but the reverses show Eros between two women. They look back to the similar representations on the lower register of the larger oenochoai of the Chariot Group (nos. 146-158), which they closely resemble. 364</page><page sequence="194">CHAPTER 29 200-5 Oreye, De rwa coll.

The third volute-krater looks slightly later than nos. 200-5 and 6, but is clearly closely connected with them and therefore better placed here than in Chapter 30, although it must be contemporary with the vases there listed in section 2(iii)b.

Body: youth by horse in naiskos; above, vase and strigil, below r., helmet; to 1., seated youth in three-quarter face with wreath and sheathed sword, woman bending forward with spear and fillet; to r., Athena with shield and spear, youth bending forward with bead-chain and wreath. (b) Shoulder: head of Nike (Kantharos Group). Body: above - woman with situla and mirror bending forward, seated nude youth with stick, woman bending forward with phiale + 2 leaves; below - head of Nike (Kantharos Group). 3.(i)a The Geneva Kantharoi (GK) Group See above, p. 334; and, in particular, K. Schauenburg, "Zu einer Gruppe polychromer Apulischen Vasen in Kiel", in Jdl 100, 1985, pp. 399-443, referred to below as ApV Kiel . In RVAp, Suppl. I, p. 190, three kantharoi were listed (nos. 280a-c) as forming a special group with handles which took the form of hollow spiralling volutes rising high above the lip of the mouth and covered with a white or yellow slip. It is now clear that nos. 280a and b are better placed with the two Kiel kantharoi (B 582-3), along with other vases associated with the Virginia Exhibition Painter and they have therefore 371</page><page sequence="201">THE WHITE SACCOS-KANTHAROS GROUP been transferred to Chapter 28 as nos. 86-19 and 20. The kantharoi listed below, which are more closely connected with the White Saccos Group, despite their superficial similarities in shape, style and decoration, differ from them in the following details: (i) there are no spurs below the volutes at the upper handle-join. (ii) the outer edge of the lip of the mouth is decorated with egg-pattern and the band beneath the pictures at the lower handle-joins with wave-pattern (instead of being painted white). (iii) the female heads on the reverses are closer to those by the White Saccos Painter or in the Kantharos Group; there is no white cross on the back hair, which often appears as a series of parallel wavy lines. The stylistic resemblance is, however, close and shows the connection between the associates of the Virginia Exhibition Painter and those of the White Saccos Painter; no. 280-1 is said to come from the same tomb as nos. 86a-e (Suppl. I, pp. 173-4). The pictures are all framed by Ionic columns. The vases of the GK Group have been numbered from 280-1 onwards. Kantharoi 280-1 Laguna Hills, private coll. (formerly in Santa Monica).

(b) The Oldenburg Group The two kantharoi nos. 280-4 and 5 look like slightly later descendants from the above; they have similar high-curving volute handles covered with a white slip, ovoli on the outer rim of the mouth and wave-pattern between the lower handle-joins. The foot is also high-stemmed with a relief band in the centre, with a reserved stripe above and below it. The drawing, however, is of inferior quality and the heads are closer to those on such vases as no. 1 7a (Suppl. I, p. 1 86, where numbered 1 7c) or nos. 23a, 26-5 and 6 above, with the same double curl beneath the ear. Of particular note are the lines of dots, often doubled, in the background (e.g. on nos. 280-4 and 5, or on and around the naiskoi on nos. 283a-d); on no. 283 ( RVAp II, p. 985), the amphora in Oldenburg, from which the painter takes his name, there is a dotted and tasselled fillet hanging outwards fçom the Ionic capitals of the naiskos and this feature reappears on nos. 283a and b; the naiskoi on nos. 283c and d are similar but lack the fillets. Nos. 281-2, 284-6 and 286a ( RVAp II, pp. 985-6 and Suppl. I, p. 190) look also to be by this painter; the Eros on no. 286a is almost identical with that on no. 280-4. Cf. also the large skyphoi nos. 29/17 and 458 which may well belong here. Kantharoi (with high volute-handles) 280-4 Once Paris Market, Galerie Mythes et Légendes. Cat.

Vases decorated in applied colour Since the publication of Suppl. I several new vases with decoration in added colours have come to light. It is now clear that these fall into two groups. The first, which might be called the Ordona Group after the vases ( RVAp II, p. 991 , nos. 334-6 and 340-1) from that site, consists of volute-kraters and amphorae which normally have a naiskos scene on the obverse, with a head of Nike on the neck, and sometimes a head, either 374</page><page sequence="204">CHAPTER 29 of a woman or of Nike, on the reverse. These heads are of the same type as those which appear on the r.f. vases of the Kantharos Group or on some of those in the White Saccos Group, and the vases on which they are depicted should therefore be products of the same workshop, matching the standard red-figured vases, but decorated in applied colours. These unfortunately are very fugitive and few of the vases survive in anything but a rather poor state. The second group, which may well have been made at Arpi, where several of them have been found, is quite different and has been studied in some detail by Marina Mazzei in her article "Nota su un gruppo di vasi policromi decorati con scene di combattimento, da Arpi" in A.I.O.N. ( Annali dell' Istituto Universitario Orientale , Sezione di Archeologia e Storia Antica , Napoli) 9, 1987, pp. 167-188, figs. 28-36. She lists (pp. 1 70- 1 ) eight volute-kraters and a jug as belonging to this group, all of which are decorated with warriors, usually in scenes of combat. The style is quite different from that of the vases in the first group and looks to belong to the early years of the third century B.C., in parallel with the polychrome vases from Canosa (see F. van der Wielen-van Ommeren in Canosa H, p. 93ff.). To her list may be added a volute-krater at one time on the Paris market with Nina Borowski, representing on the obverse seated mistress in a naiskos with a standing maid, holding cista and fan. The added colours are primarily pink and blue in the typical Canosan manner. The three other volute-kraters in Sotheby's London sale of 10-11 December 1984 (nos. 356 and 358/1 -2) are difficult to place, since they were not illustrated. Both those in lot 358 have a combat scene on the obverse, and may well, therefore, go with the vases listed by Dr. Mazzei; they do, however, have winged female heads on the neck, and this might indicate that they should be placed in the Ordona Group, to which the following additions may be made. Volute-kraters The seven following, kindly brought to our attention by Dr. Elena Antonacci, who is planning to publish them, are in the Sansone collection at Mattinata. All have naiskos scenes on the obverses, with a head of Nike on the neck, and mostly female heads on the reverses, which are for the most part very ill-preserved, so that the head is often difficult to make out. They are, like the Nike heads on the necks, all in the manner of the Kantharos Group. 339-1 Mattinata, Sansone coll. 1435. (a) Warrior striding to 1. in naiskos. 339-2 Mattinata, Sansone coll. 1437. (a) Warrior striding to 1. in naiskos. The neck of the reverse has a laurel wreath as on Hobart 95 (no. 336a). 339-3 Mattinata, Sansone coll. 1436.

The Kantharos Group Well over 100 vases decorated with female heads in the typical manner of the Kantharos Group (see RVAp II, pp. 991-2) have come to our notice in recent years. They appear regularly in the Sale Catalogues of various auction-houses in Europe, London and New York and, after the sale, tend to vanish from sight, sometimes turning up later in private collections or at subsequent sales. As the decoration on these vases is extremely uniform, they are not always easy to identify from summary descriptions, unless they have been illustrated in the relevant Sale Catalogue ; this is seldom the case, since several of them are often put together in a single lot among the less significant items in the sale (e.g. lot 496 in Sotheby's, Sale Catalogue of 13-14 Dec. 1990: "Six Apulian Kantharoi, all with the head of a woman on both sides"). It is, therefore, possible that some of the vases in the lists below may be duplicated, especially when they are known to us only from a reproduction of one of the two heads with which they are decorated. We have tried to check such vases as carefully as possible, but many of them disappear almost immediately after the sale and there is no way of tracking down their present location. Heads of the Kantharos type will also be found on the reverses of the larger vases by the White Saccos Painter and his associates, as well as the sole decoration on smaller vases (see above nos. 3b-f, 6c-g, 8d-f, 17b, 23a, 26a-c, 26-1 to 4, 29a-e, etc.). They show the vases of the Kantharos Group to be products of the White Saccos workshop; they are the work of several different painters, some of whom have a charac- teristically individual style, but, in view of the generally high degree of uniformity, they have for the most part been grouped together, in sub-division (iv) "General". 376</page><page sequence="206">CHAPTER 29 (i) The K-S Painter Plates *353a Canosa, Garriba coll. 3.

(iii)a Four Kantharoi The four following kantharoi, which were sold at Sotheby's in London on 10 July 1984 as lots 471 and 472, go very closely together and are the work of the same painter. Characteristic of his style are: (1) the white spiky Stephane across a reserved stripe above a mass of black hair on the brow, which has a wavy white line running down it, (2) the hair falls in a solid mass over and below the ear; there is a pendant earring consisting of a series of white dots, sometimes with a dot-cluster, a circle or an ivy-leaf on top, (3) the hair is confined in a kekryphalos , with black, white and reserved stripes, sometimes dotted, and a row of black stripes at the top where the back hair emerges. The kantharoi have tall stems with a relief band in the centre; the heads aré framed between white Ionic columns, but there is no other pattern-work. In treatment the heads are close to those in the general Kantharos Group, but lack the typical band of crosses on the head-dress. The upper eyelid consists of two lines meeting at a very acute angle; the pupil is a vertical stroke. The drawing of the mouth on no. 370- 1 suggests some influence from the Stoke-on-Trent Painter. 377</page><page sequence="207">THE WHITE SACCOS-KÀNTHAROS GROUP Kantharoi 370-1 Once New York Market, Royal-Athena Galleries SLB 171, ex London Market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 10 July 1984, no. 471/2, then B.A. Seaby Ltd., Antiquities Forum 8, Oct. 1989, no. 37, ill. on p. 10. *370-2 to 4 Once London Market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 9-10 July 1984, nos. 471/1 and 472/1-2.

Introduction The new material which has come to light from the final stages of Apulian red-figure merely serves to emphasise the rapid decline that has taken place in the quality of the drawing and the loss of interest in mythological or theatrical subjects. The most noteworthy of the new vases form a coherent group, which may be regarded as last flowering of the school of the White Saccos Painter. Most of them appear to be the work of a single artist, to whom the name of the Moonen Painter has been given, from the three vases in that collection (RVAp II, nos. 30-31 and no. 3 lj below); his most important works are a series of oenochoai (shape 1) and kantharoi, several of which appeared on the London market at Sotheby's in December 1990 (sale of 13-14 Dec., nos. 504, 506, 508 = nos. 31e, f and o below), with others on the New York market (nos. 3 1 d, g, h, i). It is probable that all of them came from the same tomb. They depict a variety of subjects and show a very characteristic style of drawing which clearly harks back to that on vases in the Stuttgart Group, but has deteriorated considerably into something that can only be described as slapdash, with even worse to follow (as on nos. 31o-w). Of the later vases the most interesting is perhaps the large volute-krater (no. 31z below) with its multiple figures, in three registers on the obverse and two on the reverse, whose drapery is characterised by the use of numerous small broken lines, which produce a very fussy effect. The latest stage is represented by some badly fragmented volute-kraters and amphorae, at present in a private collection in Laguna Hills (see p. 397 below), with naiskos scenes on the obverse and draped youths or women on the reverse, but until they have been recomposed, it is difficult to do more than give them a general classification. With them were found a large number of vases decorated with female heads, all of very poor quality and some with over-emphasised chins (e.g. nos. 119-1 to 3 below), which give them almost the appearance of a caricature.

I, p. 201), who may be called the Auxerre Painter after the two bell-kraters (nos. 13c and d), sold in that city. Particularly noteworthy is his treatment of women's drapery, with very clearly defined fold-lines (especially across the breasts, as on nos. 13b-d); also the rendering of the hair, tied round the bunch at the back by a white ribbon, looped on top and flapping out below (nos. 13, 13a to d). There is a white beaded headdress across the hair above the brow, which terminates in an earring (ivy-leaf, or dot-cluster). The youth on the reverse of no. 1 3e is very similar to those on nos. 1 3 and 1 3a. The meanders on nos. 1 3b, d and e are identical, with a dividing stroke between them. Bari 5604 (no. 12) looks to be by a different hand but related in style. Hydria * 1 3b Once Rome Market.

The Foggia-Bassano Group (i) The Foggia Group NOTE. The volute-krater, once on the London, and later on the New York, market, listed in Suppl.

The two following skyphoi, both in poor condition and recomposed from a number of fragments, look to be associated with the vases in the Foggia Group, especially from the treatment of the women's breasts and drapery.

I, p. 202 a stamnos in a private collection in Bari and a lebes gamikos, once with Christie's, were put together as nos. 26b-c and associated in style with other vases in the Bassano Group. Further vases by the same hand have subsequently come to light, and it will be noted that on several of his vases at least one of the figures holds a wreath of characteristic appearance (e.g. the seated youth on the obverse, and the satyr on the reverse, of no. 26b; the Eros on the reverse of nos. 26c and 26e); the leaves are divided by a series of vertical black strokes, and there is often a white dot at the tip of each leaf. The painter also makes considerable use of comb-palmettes, and the faces of his youths often have a rather flattened look. Skyphos *26d Melbourne, Geddes coll.

The vase has been recomposed from fragments and there is a good deal of repainting, which has distorted the faces of the woman to 1. on the obverse and to r. on the reverse. A good deal of added red was employed, both in the pattern-work (e.g. for the lotus buds between the palmettes on the shoulder of the obverse, for alternate laurel leaves, and for the row of egg-like objects on top of the naiskos pediment) and on the drapery (the stripes and borders of the garments worn by the two women on the obverse, the border of the youth's cloak). The comb-palmettes and the wreaths find parallels on no. 26e, and the general appearance of the vase suggests it is a late work, not very far away from the volute-krater no. 31g below, and leading on to the work of the Mattinata Painter (cf. nos. 64 and 65). Amphora *26f Once Melbourne Market, Graham Geddes coll. A 1:29, ex Leonard Joel Auctions, sale of 3 Dec. 1990, no. 194, ex London Market, Sotheby's, SaleCat. 12 Dec. 1988, no. 163, ill. on p. 100.

(iii)(b) Late Descendants of the White Saccos Group In RVAp II, p. 1 022, two oenochoai, at that time on the London market and now in the Moonen collection in Emblem, were put together as late descendants of the White Saccos Group (nos. 30-31) and in Suppl. I, p. 202, a third was added to the list as no. 31a. A great many more by the same hand have now come to light and they represent the final stage in the development of the White Saccos Group, though in treatment they clearly belong with the latest vases in the present chapter. Nos. 3 ld-i and o, all said to have come from the same tomb, well illustrate the decline in the quality of the drawing, though their painter retains many of the standard devices found on the later vases from the White Saccos Workshop, especially in the Stuttgart Group. Characteristic of many of the vases listed below is the combination of diluted glaze (in a golden-brown shade) with figures in added white - this may be seen very clearly in the figures in the naiskos on no. 3 Id, but it is also apparent on the animals on nos. 3 1 g and h. We may note the substantial deterioration in the drawing of the faces, both frontal and in profile, and the rather sketchy treatment of the drapery folds, especially over the breasts, at the waist and behind the bent leg. Back hair often assumes a "trident" form, with a fairly large reserved area around it. The artist may be named the Moonen Painter, after the collection in which nos. 30 and 31 are now located.

Both sides are decorated with multi-figured compositions (14 in three registers on the obverse; 9 in two on the reverse), and on the neck of the obverse there are five figures, with four on the reverse, giving a total of 32 in all. Such compositions look back to the work of the Darius and Underworld Painters and even more closely to that of the Baltimore Painter and his associates. What is, however, unusual is that neither scene appears to have a specific funerary or mythological significance, but looks to be concerned with some form of ritual or perhaps with bridal preparations. The style follows on from that of vases like nos. 3 ld-f, with a rather more elaborate treatment of the drapery-folds (cf. no. 26f), and connects it with the work of the Mattinata Painter. The masks on the handles are surrounded by scroll-work and Erotes are depicted on the blinkers in the manner of the volute-kraters in the Stuttgart Group (cf. nos. 29/200-1 to 6 above).

Neck: (a) seated woman with phiale and bunch of grapes, nude youth with cista and rosette-chain, woman playing flute, woman bending forward with mirror and tambourine, seated youth with cista and bunch of grapes, (b) seated woman, Eros with cista and situla, seated youth with phiale and thyrsus, youth coming up with phiale, rosette-chain and mirror. Masks: (a) in scroll-work, female heads with yellow hair and white flesh, (b) similar, except that the scroll-work is more elaborate and comes down on to the blinkers. Blinkers: (a) to 1., Eros holding fillet with both hands; to r., Eros moving to r., with situla and ball. The situla in the Sciclounoff collection in Geneva ( PdD , pp. 237-240; ex London market, Sotheby's, Sale Cat. 12 Dec. 1983, no. 391, ill. on p. 120) looks somewhat akin in style and treatment (cf. especially the drawing of the drapery) to this vase. (e) Two small mugs in Bari The two following small oenochoai (shape 8B) make a matching pair; both are decorated with thin leaves (laurel) in b.f. on the neck, and large egg-pattem on the shoulder.

Stivin of Paris illustrate as item 1261 a volute-krater, which looks to be by the Mignot Painter. The description is not accurately given and no mention is made of the reverse. As illustrated the vase depicts (a) Eros and woman in naiskos, with a plant in the pediment and a bird above the acroteria on either side. On the neck is a female head, almost frontal, with a bell-shaped flower and tendrils on either side. Without seeing the actual vase, we can place it here only tentatively, but the obverse has affinities with those of nos. 43-44.

They have not yet been restored and many are still in fragmentary condition.

With the vases in (1) to (3) above were also found numerous lekanides decorated with female heads (Plate CXI, 7) in a style similar to that of the Painter of B.M. F 339, especially in regard to the rendering of the mouth (cf. nos. 1 10, 1 15). The larger vases all look to be the work of a single painter, who must be a very late descendant of the White Saccos Group, but, until they have been recomposed, it seems better not to attempt a more precise classification.

The more important auction sales of classical antiquities in both Paris and the provinces are normally announced in the Gazette de V Hôtel Drouot , often with accompanying illustrations of the more significant items. The larger provincial sales (e.g. at Auxerre) often have printed illustrated catalogues, to which references are given below, where possible; the others have only lists of the vases for sale, which are not always readily available and in such cases only the date of the sale can be given.

He has been able to make an intensive study of the old registers and accession books and thus to identify the Pottier Salle K numbers of many vases, for which they had previously been lacking. He further informs us that a catalogue of the vases in the Edmond Durand collection (compiled in 1830) records the proveniences of numerous vases. These are given below, though some of them (especially Campanian sites like Capua or Nola) should probably be treated with some reservations. Also listed are the numbers of vases in the different catalogues, some of which were not included in RVAp. AC = inventory of 1816 (vases brought back from Italy) Cp = Campana inventory K = Pottier' s catalogue of vases in Salle K LL = acquisitions in the time of Louis XVIII MN = accessioned before 1848, with subsequent accession books MNB ( 1 87 1 - 1 88 1 ), MNC (1881-1898), MND (1899-1967), MNE (1967-...). N = inventory of earlier acquisitions, 1 857 CA = an accession book and inventory started in 1886 S = an inventory started in 1907 for vases of which the earlier numbers had been lost.

References are given first to the chapter number and then to the serial number of the vase in that chapter; occasionally page references are also given when subjects are discussed at some length in the text. Many of the larger vases (especially volute-kraters) depict an assembly of gods in the upper register on the obverse, usually above a mythological scene; these are indexed under "GODS, Assembly of', and the individual deities there represented are not indexed separately, unless their presence has some particular significance. It should also be noted that the stele scenes which appear as the standard decoration on the reverses of the larger vases are not indexed separately, nor are the female heads which figure on so many vases, either as the sole design or, in a floral setting, on the necks of volute-kraters or the shoulders of amphorae. References to Eros are given only when he is present in a mythological, Dionysiac or genre context, and not to his very frequent appearance as the principal subject or on the necks of volute-kraters. In Index IV(iii) references are given to the pages on which the vases of the painter or group concerned are listed. Much of Index IV(i) and (ii) was compiled by Stavros Paspalas of the University of Sydney, to whom we are greatly indebted for his help in this regard.
