<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Tillich and the Supreme Court: Tillich's "Ultimate Concern" as a Standard in Judicial Interpretation JAMES McBRIDE In its pivotal decision of the 1960s conscientious objector cases, the Supreme Court's United States v. Seeger (1965) opinion introduced the concept of "ultimate concern" as the criterion by which an individual's beliefs may be judged religious under the Free Exercise Clause.1 As one commentator has put it, the justices "had tapped into one of the most respected, yet expansive, traditions in the phenomenological approach to religion."2 Pursuant to the constitutional precedent of Everson v. Board of Education and affirmed by Torcaso v. Watkins,3 the High Court was compelled to expand its reading of the Free Exercise Clause beyond the narrow limits of Judeo-Christian theism invoked in past constitutional opinions and incorporated by the Congress in statutory legislation, particularly the laws of conscription. Since the Court was ill-equipped to formulate its own phenomenological description of a more broadly defined concept of religion, the justices sought to dismantle the narrow interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause by invoking authorities on religion who were widely known and accepted in contemporary intellectual circles. Drawing upon the supporting evidence submitted in the appellant United States v. Jakobson case4 (reviewed with Peter v. United States under United States v. Seeger), the Court cited • JAMES McBRIDE (B.A., The Johns Hopkins University; M.A., University of Chicago; Ph.D., Graduate Theological Union/University of California at Berkeley) is Assistant Professor of Religion and Social Ethics, College of Wooster, Ohio, and a former editor of Cults, Culture and the Law: Perspectives on the New Religious Movements.

Robinson, the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich, England, and Paul Tillich, the German-American philosopher of religion who had taught at some of America's most prestigious institutions of religious scholarship—the Union Theological Seminary, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago Divinity School. In delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice Tom Clark used Bishop Robinson to distinguish between the more traditional notion of a God "up there" and the contemporary recognition of God as a spiritual presence "down here."5 Robinson's distinction was prefaced in the opinion by reference to Tillich's concept of the deity as "the God above the God of theism" and later followed by Tillich's conclusion that the word "God" is not definitive in the designation of religious belief. "And if that word [God] has not much meaning for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life, of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of what you take most seriously without reservation. Perhaps in order to do so, you must forget everything traditional that you have learned about God . . . ."6 Based upon the concepts of religion provided by these two Christian theologians, the Court held that, in regard to Seeger as well as to Jakobson and Peter which were subsumed under Seeger, the individuals in question need not profess belief in a traditionally conceived notion of a "Supreme Being" in order to qualify for conscientious objector status under the 1948 Universal Military Training and Service Act. Although the Court's new and more open interpretation of religion was legitimated by both Robinson and Tillich, it is clear that Tillich's concept of religion was dispositive largely due to Robinson's acknowledgment that Tillich's work had inspired his own. Indeed, it was the passage discussing "ultimate concern" cited by the Court in the Seeger decision which was one of the key writings that, in Robinson's words, "have since proved seminal not only for me but for many of this generation."7 Although the Court did not recognize Robinson's debt to Tillich, the bishop confessed that Tillich's sermon on "ultimate concern," entitled "The Depth of Existence," "opened my eyes to the transformation that seemed to come over so much of the traditional religious symbolism when it was transposed from the heights to the depths."8 5.

Indeed, one critic claimed that "[f]ar-reaching and, to some, surprising consequences, seemed to flow from that reliance" of the Court on Tillich's definition of religion.9 Recent federal cases bear witness to the attempt by conservative Christian litigants to employ the Seeger decision, aptly called "the most thoroughly considered attempt by the Supreme Court to define 'religion,' "10 as the basis for the determination of religious belief not only under the Free Exercise Clause but also under the Establishment Clause as well.11 Conservative Christian lawyers have argued that if traditionally nonreligious, nontheistic beliefs, e.g., "secular humanist" values held with "ultimate concern," were to be considered religious under the Free Exercise Clause, then such views should likewise be regarded as religious under the Establishment Clause.12 And if what is protected under the Free Exercise Clause is prohibited under the Establishment Clause, the religious status of "secular humanism" under the former should ensure that it not be "established" in the public school system under the latter. Although conservative Christians have failed in the past to have Tillich's criterion of religious belief recognized under the Establishment Clause, most notably in Grove v. Mead,13 the abbreviated success of fundamentalists on the federal district court 9. "Toward a Constitutional Definition," 1066. 10. Jesse H. Choper, "Defining 'Religion' in the First Amendment," University of Illinois Law Review (1982):579, 593. 11. The "religion clauses" of the First Amendment read as follows: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." 12. Although, strictly speaking, the Seeger decision did not raise the question of whether atheistic beliefs could be considered religious (see 380 U.S. 163 at 173-4), the Court's interpretation of "ultimate concern" as referring to a belief which occupied "the same place in the life of an objector as an orthodox belief in God" (at 184) indicated that a belief need not be theistic to be religious. This interpretation was confirmed by the Court's decision in Welsh v. United States in which it was held, Welsh's atheism notwithstanding, that "[bjecause his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as much entitled to a religious conscientious objector exemption under 6(j) as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions." 398 U.S. 333, 340. 13. In Grove v. Mead School District, 753 F.2d 1529 (1985), the plaintiff, a Fundamentalist Christian parent, alleged that in requiring her daughter to read Gordon Parks' The Learning Tree in a sophomore English class, the school board abridged the right to the free exercise of religion and established a "religion of secularism," i.e., "secular humanism." Since the plaintiffs daughter was offered an alternative reading, no violation of the Free Exercise Clause</page><page sequence="4">248 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE level in the Greenville, Tennessee, Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board case suggested to some attorneys that conservative Christians had heretofore lacked the appropriate vehicle for litigation.14 In that case, fundamentalist parents argued that the school district's basic readers, published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, taught forms of salvation which rivaled "faith in Jesus Christ." In drawing up his opinion Judge Thomas Hull established an "opt-out" alternative for parents who find materials in the public school curriculum religiously objectionable, allowing students to receive alternative education in those subjects at home.15 And in the Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County case litigated at the federal district court level in Alabama, conservative Christian parents contended not only that certain materials in the public schools advance the "religion" of secular humanism and inhibit fundamentalism but also that such materials should be removed from the curriculum since they stand in violation of the Establishment Clause.16 These plaintiffs found support from some witnesses, such as Professor James Davison Hunter, a sociologist from the University of Virginia, who drew on Tillich's notion of religion to testify that secular humanism is in fact a bona fide religion. Although the arguments of conservative Christian lawyers may be flawed on factual grounds—for example, whether public school curricula may be characterized as constituting a coherent worldview held with "ultimate concern"17—nonetheless they have raised constitutionally significant issues: whether the religion clauses of the was found. Although the court examined the claims of the plaintiff that The Learning Tree resulted in "advancing" the religion of "secular humanism" while "inhibiting" the plaintiffs faith of "Biblical Christianity," the court held that the inclusion of such a work, even if it contains anti-Christian or "secular humanist" elements, does not necessarily imply government endorsement (at 1539-40). The claim of establishment must be substantiated by how the book is taught. Even the discussion of the Bible is permitted in the public schools as long as the text is not presented to the students as religious truth. 14. Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board, 827 F.2d 684 (1987), cert, denied, 2/22/88. 15. Although in the Mozert decision, Federal District Court Judge Thomas Hull ruled that portions of the public school curriculum violated the sincerely-held religious beliefs of Fundamentalist parents and their children under the Free Exercise Clause, the decision implied that educational programs of the state which encourage the autonomous values of citizenry establish a "religion of secularism," in violation of the Establishment Clause. If sustained, the opinion would have put the state in a precarious position. By the very fact that educational programs are designed within constitutional guidelines, i.e., they have a secular purpose, public schools may violate the constitutional rights of religious parents and children. 16. Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 827 F.2d 684 (1987). 17. Although conservative Christian litigants won victories on the federal district court level in both the Mozert and Smith decisions, both lost on the appeals level. Neither proved to be the long-awaited definitive case by which the "ultimate concern" standard could be tested, since the courts of appeal held that the plaintiffs in the Mozert and Smith decisions had not proven their claims. "Under the court's assessment of the facts," stated the Mozert opinion, "this is a most uninteresting case. It is not the test case sought, or feared, by either side.</page><page sequence="5">PAUL TILLICH AND THE SUPREME COURT 249 First Amendment are co-extensive, i.e., does religion have the same meaning in both clauses?, and whether Tillich's concept of "ultimate concern" as commonly interpreted by legal scholars and judges clarifies or obscures constitutional claims involving the religion clauses. The purpose of this article is to describe the logic and utility of Tillich's concept of religious faith as the definitive standard by which to judge the character of beliefs under the Free Exercise Clause; to illustrate the substantive problems in constitutional interpretation which have arisen in the wake of the Seeger decision; and to demonstrate that these problems, particularly the application of the "ultimate concern" standard to the Establishment Clause, are based on widely-held misinterpretations of Tillich's theology common to legal scholars in this area. The Expansive Definition of Religion in the Free Exercise Clause In light of the citation of Tillich's "ultimate concern" as the criterion to judge whether a belief is religious in nature, the Seeger decision stands as a significant case in the judicial interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. Yet, strictly speaking, United States v. Seeger concerns the statutory interpretation of congressional intent embodied in the 1948 Universal Military Training and Service Act. How, then, could the Seeger decision be considered a crucial element in the formation of constitutional precedent relevant to religious The court reviews the record and finds that the plaintiffs actually want a school system that affirmatively teaches the correctness of their religion, and prevents other students from mentioning contrary ideas. If that is indeed the case, then it can be very simply resolved. It would obviously violate the Establishment Clause for any school system to agree with such an extravagant view. "It should be noted and emphasized that if such is the holding, this decision is largely irrelevant to the national legal controversy over this case . . . "I find the [district] court's conclusion based on its reading of the record to be unsatisfactory on the factual basis of what was said at the trial." Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board at 1074-5. Likewise, the plaintiffs in Smith did not reach the substantive constitutional issues involved in the application of "ultimate concern" to secular humanism since they too failed to prove their case. "The Supreme Court," read the Court of Appeals opinion, "has never established a comprehensive test for determining the 'delicate question' of what constitutes a religious belief for purposes of the First Amendment, and we need not attempt to do so in this case, for we find that, even assuming that secular humanism is a religion for the purposes of the establishment clause, appellees have failed to prove a violation of the establishment clause through the use in the Alabama public schools of the textbooks at issue in this case." Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County at 689. It should be stressed that since both Mozert and Smith litigations failed for evidentiary rather than constitutional reasons, the "ultimate concern" standard as a potential "comprehensive test for determining the 'delicate question' of what constitutes a religious belief" is still very much a live issue.</page><page sequence="6">250 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE belief? "Although Seeger was resolved strictly as a matter of statutory interpretation," wrote one constitutional scholar, "the decision appeared to have important Constitutional portents, particularly because the Court's straining of the language of the statute . . . was prompted by its desire to [avoid] imputing to Congress an intent to classify different religious beliefs, exempting some and excluding others . . ."l8 Accordingly, it is persuasively argued that the grounds for the High Court's interpretation of the congressional statute on conscription was implicitly, if not explicitly, constitutional, i.e., that the congressional statute could not be at variance with the meaning of religion inherent in the Free Exercise Clause.19 Hence, in the context of the Free Exercise cases heard by the High Court, the Seeger opinion held a crucial position in the evolution of the judicial understanding of religious belief. In two of the most prominent nineteenth century cases involving the religion clauses and Mormonism, the Court seemed to settle implicitly on three criteria in the determination of religious faith, consonant with the tenets of Judeo-Christian theism: (1) a belief in the existence of a deity; (2) a recognition of the cosmogonie powers of that deity, i.e., a Creator-God; and (3) the establishment of some personal relationship between deity and believer which demanded particular forms of ethical behavior. The Court defined religious belief as "the duty we owe the creator" in Reynolds v. United States20 and reiterated its position in Davis v. Beason when it held that "the term 'religion' has reference to one's own views of his relations with his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character and of obedience to his will. One cannot speak of religious liberty, without proper appreciation of its essential and historical significance, without assuming the existence of a belief in supreme allegiance to the will of God."21 This attitude of the Court which seemed to inject confessional elements into the very definition of religion was held well into the twentieth century. Even as late as 1931, the Court couched its discussion of religion in these traditional terms. "Religion obviously encompasses more than mere belief, faith, sentiment, or opinion. By its very force it embraces human conduct expressive of the relation between man and God."22 18. "Toward a Constitutional Definition," 589, citing United States v. Seeger at 176. 19. Although the Court recognized that Seeger, Jakobson, and Peter raised constitutional arguments against paragraph 6(j) of the 1948 draft law concerning the status of conscientious objectors, the Court granted the cases certiorari on the grounds of statutory interpretation. Hence the Court sought to "narrow the inquiry" by divining "the meaning of this statutory language." United States v. Seeger at 165, 173. 20. Reynolds v. United States at 163. 21. Davis v. Beason at 342. 22. United States v. Macintosh at 612.</page><page sequence="7">PAUL TILLICH AND THE SUPREME COURT 251 Yet, it was also obvious that the confidence of the Court was eroding due to its understandable discomfort with judging which tenets of faith might be indicative of "true" religion and which betrayed fraudulent claims. "What constitutes free exercise of religion cannot perhaps be dogmatically determined. It is a case where this Court must pick out a line, between conscience and the command of the State."23 The change in the Court's posture intimated by the Macintosh opinion was later to be realized in the United States v. Ballard decision of 1944.24 Although in this landmark decision, the defendant's religious views coincided with the above-listed criteria, the Supreme Court held that it was beyond the reach of government and the Court's competence to judge the veracity of religious beliefs in order to determine the authenticity of such claims. As Justice William O. Douglas argued, "Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others. Yet the fact that they may be beyond the ken of mortals does not mean that they can be made suspect before the law."25 The Court however held that the judiciary may legitimately inquire into the sincerity of the beliefs held. In displacing the veracity of belief, the sincerity test implied that the definition of religion under the Free Exercise Clause was not so much a question of cognitive content as affective attitude. The rejection of explicit doctrinal criteria in the definition of religion was later confirmed in the establishment case Torcaso v. Watkins in which the Court held that theistic belief could not be considered the sine qua non of a constitutionally viable notion of legally recognizable religious faith.26 The Court justified its abandonment of theistic tenets, common to the Judeo-Christian tradition, by citing the existence of nontheistic beliefs long since held as religious elsewhere in the world and popularly recognized as such in the United States.27 Although the judicial direction on this constitutional question had been laid out in the Ballard and Torcaso decisions, this new perspective betokened by the sincerity test and the rejection of theistic criteria posed a fundamental problem. Since the Court was Ibid, at 613. United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944). Ibid at 86-7. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961).

The Court was left with only the sincerity test as a means to implement a relatively barren criterion on which to base judgments in Free Exercise cases. How could simply an affective attitude, i.e., sincerity alone, be construed as the determinative characteristic of religious faith? It was in the context of this history of the Free Exercise Clause that the Court was driven toward Paul Tillich's theology and his concept of religion as "ultimate concern." Although Tillich's work could be viewed as a catalyst for the Court's opinion on the Free Exercise Clause, the introduction of "ultimate concern" as a dispositive criterion in the constitutional interpretation of religion is rooted in the judicial history of conscription cases. For it is here that the definition of religion is deemed crucial in the adjudication of conscientious objector status. Interpretation of Congressional Statutes on Conscription According to the Draft Law of 1917, conscientious objector status was granted only to "members of a well-organized sect or organization."28 The intent of the legislation was to deny exemptions to registrants who had "private" reservations about the Great War, unrelated to a comprehensive religious ethos. The failure of the "personal interpretation" of the will of God to reach a source of constitutional and statutory authority was later affirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Macintosh,29 In refusing the naturalization application of a Canadian immigrant, Douglas Clyde Macintosh, Dwight Professor of Theology and chaplain at Yale Divinity School, the Court in 1931 rejected the defendant's claim to reserve the right to decide whether a war in which he was called upon to serve was morally justifiable. The Court further suggested that the only constitutionally viable grounds for religious objection to conscription were beliefs rooted in Christian theism—a position consonant with the operative definitions of religion found in both the Reynolds and Davis cases. "We are a Christian people," read the opinion, "according to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledging with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God."30 28. Act of 18 May 1917, ch. 15, para. 4, 40 Stat. 78 (1919). 29. United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605 (1931). 30. Ibid at 625.</page><page sequence="9">PAUL TILLICH AND THE SUPREME COURT 253 With the war in Europe pressing closer toward the end of the 1930s decade, the Congress adopted the 1940 Selective Training and Service Act which replaced the conscientious objection criterion of "membership in a well-organized religious sect or organization" with an exemption based on "religious training and belief. " The broadening of the grounds for conscientious objection was due in part to testimony before the Congress which emphasized the need to recognize religious scruples either outside sects traditionally associated with pacifism or apart from religious institutions altogether. In separating conscientious objection from institutional religion the Congress placed statutory priority on religious conscience rather than membership in religious bodies, and, by doing so, opened the question of religious belief to more nontraditional, e.g., nontheistic, non-Christian, interpretations of faith. In the wake of the Ballard decision (1944), where the Court declared it beyond its competence to determine the tenets of a legally-recognizable religious faith, the Congress amended the language of subsection 5(g) of the 1940 act to mean by "religious training and belief," "an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code."31 Although the statutory language of the 1948 Act was reminiscent of the criteria formerly used by the Court in Free Exercise cases, i.e., a deity to whom the individual is morally obliged, the Court was determined in the conscientious objector cases of the 1960s to read the statute as being consonant with the Ballard decision. Hence, in the eyes of the Court it was significant that, although the language of paragraph 6(j) was drawn almost word for word from Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' definition of religion found in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Macintosh,32 the Congress saw fit to substitute the term "Supreme Being" for "God"—thereby providing the opportunity to read the statute in conformity with Ballard's proscription against establishing tenets of "true" religious faith. The change in congressional language could be used as a lever which would widen the interpretation of religion to encompass all manner of religious belief—a judicial maneuver described by one constitu tional scholar as a "remarkable feat of linguistic transmutation."33 Yet the question remained: How would the federal judiciary and 31. 50 U.S.C. 4560). 32.

"Toward a Constitutional Definition," 1065.</page><page sequence="10">254 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE particularly the Supreme Court specifically interpret the term "Supreme Being"? The federal judiciary was faced with the difficult task of translating the High Court's guidelines, outlined in the Ballard and Torcaso decisions, into a practical understanding of what a "sincere" belief in a "Supreme Being" might mean. The opportunity arose in the Second Circuit where the U.S. Court of Appeals agreed to hear the case of Arno Sascha Jakobson who had been denied conscientious objector status and convicted of refusal to submit to induction in the U.S. Armed Forces.34 Although the local Selectivè Service Board had accepted the sincerity of his beliefs, it had rejected his application for conscientious objector status on the grounds that his views were based on a "personal moral code" rather than "religious training and belief."35 Jakobson argued that his religious beliefs were not based upon faith in God but rather upon "Godness" to which the individual may have a "direct, vertical relationship" or an "indirect, horizontal relationship." Jakobson further argued that a direct, vertical relationship leads either to an egocentric hubris which undermines the very foundations of faith or to an inward-turning pietism which tolerates evil in the world. Neither, claimed Jakobson, was an acceptable religious alternative. Thus, the only legitimate association with "Godness" lay in the indirect, horizontal relationship in which the individual binds "himself to the qualities of Godness that exist in every creation, in Mankind and throughout the world."36 Jakobson's respect for the manifestation of the divine in creation prompted him to reject war and violence as morally repugnant. Although Judge Henry Jacob Friendly noted the unorthodox character of this concept of "Godness," he saw no reason to exclude Jakobson's faith from protection under the statute's provision for those whose objections are based on "religious training and belief." "A statute could scarcely be defended on this score," he wrote, "if it protected the 'free exercise' of only a few favored religions over others without a reasonable basis for doing so. . . . The time honored principle of construing a statute not only to escape unconstitutionality but to avoid 'grave and doubtful' constitutional questions . . . thus dictates reading the definition of 'religious training and belief in 6(j) as broadly as the words pertain."37 Judge Friendly did not choose on his own to regard Jakobson's notion of "Godness" in terms of the statutory designation of a 34.

Indeed, the judge supported his conclusion by citing Paul Tillich whose theology seemed to "embrace" Jakobson's unorthodox religious ideas. "Jakobson's definition of religion," read the opinion, "parallels] the views of this eminent theologian rather strikingly."38 In footnote 5 the Court concluded that Jakobson's concept of the horizontal relationship to "Godness" was reflected in Tillich's notion of transcendence, presented in the second volume of his Systematic Theology which had rejected the anthropomorphic "superworld" of divine objects.39 The "Godness" of Jakobson's cosmology seemed to mime Tillich's affirmation of God as the "ground of being" in which the natural and spiritual worlds are rooted. Jakobson's discarding of "God" for "Godness" did not invalidate his appeal since the language of the statute had substituted "Supreme Being" for "God," and Tillich himself had abandoned this theistic designation for what he alternatively called "the power of being" in The Courage to Be and the "God above the God of theism" in the second volume of the Systematic. In what would prove to be a key passage cited in footnote 5 of the Jakobson decision and featured in the text of the Seeger decision of the Supreme Court, Tillich's description of "ultimate concern" was incorporated by Judge Friendly as the operative definition of religion. In light of Tillich's concept, it was apparent that Jakobson's concept of "Godness" constituted a religious belief and the appeals court considered it an "erroneous construction" of the statute to construe Jakobson's beliefs as falling outside the scope of the statutory definition of religion. Jakobson's conviction was reversed. In granting review of the decision on appeal by the United States government, the Supreme Court subsumed United States v. Jakobson and Peter v. United States under United States v. Seeger since these cases raised substantially the same questions on the interpretation of the 1948 Universal Military Training and Service Act. In Peter v. United States the appellant, Forest Britt Peter, was convicted for refusing to submit to induction despite his moral objection to participation in war. In words reminiscent of Justice Holmes' definition of "religious training and belief," Peter argued that the prohibition against taking human life was superior to his obligation to the state. Peter chose not to base his convictions on what was commonly regarded as the "Supreme Being," i.e., God, but on a conception of religious belief described as "the consciousness of some power manifest in nature which helps man in the ordering of his 38.

Peter surmised that his religious views might be regarded as a belief in a Supreme Being, but his refusal to complete Section VII of the Selective Service form on religious belief in a Supreme Being led to doubt concerning the religious character of his beliefs and ultimately to his conviction for refusal to undergo induction (affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals). In United States v. Seeger the respondent had argued that although he preferred to leave the question of his religious belief in a Supreme Being open, he practiced a "religious faith in a purely ethical creed"41—a juxtaposition which seemed particularly problematic from a legal viewpoint since the statute specifically excluded practitioners of a "merely personal moral code" from conscientious objector status. Although Seeger was found to hold these beliefs sincerely, the district court ruled that his views were not based on "a belief in a relation to a Supreme Being"—a judgment overturned by the Second Circuit Court and appealed by the government. In the oral arguments of the Seeger decision presented before the High Court by the solicitor general of the United States, Archibald Cox, the government contended that the Supreme Court ought to affirm the conviction in the Peter case and overturn the reversals in the Jakobson and Seeger cases due to lack of sincerity, on the one hand, and the "essentially political, sociological or philosophical views" of the individuals, on the other. It is surprising to note that the government accepted the concepts of Paul Tillich and Bishop Robinson, first cited in Judge Friendly's opinion in the Jakobson appeals case, as authoritative in the broadening of the statutory language, i.e., "Supreme Being." We- do not quarrel in any material respect with Judge Friendly's interpretation of the statute. I'm also inclined not to stress any differences with him as to whether Jakobson's presentation of his views about the nature of God fails to come within the statute. They are remarkably similar to those of Paul Tillich and of Dr. Robinson.42 We adopt a more liberal interpretation, having in mind not only the diversity of religions in this country, but also the fact that such eminent theologians as Professor Tillich and Dr. Robinson, the Anglican Bishop of Willich [sic], eschew the idea 40.

"Within that phrase ['religious training and belief]," wrote Justice Clark, "would come all sincere religious beliefs which are based upon a power of being, or else upon a faith, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent. The test might be stated in these words, 'A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory defini tion.' "45 This so-called "parallel position" test to be used as a standard of interpretation in judicial consideration of conscientious objector cases was therefore introduced and shaped by the language taken almost directly from Tillich's conception of religion in which a "Supreme Being" is conceived in terms of a "power of being" (cited in the passage on the "God above the God of theism" from the second volume of Tillich's Systematic) upon which "all else is dependent"—a clear allusion to Tillich's notion of "ultimate concern" (cited in the quotation of Tillich's sermon "The Depth of Existence"). Although the standard for the interpretation of "religious training and belief' which governed conscientious objector cases was to be the "parallel position" rule, it became clear that both the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary's understanding of religion under the statute and the Free Exercise Clause was to be grounded in Tillich's expansive definition of religion. The Court's adoption of this expansive definition of religion was tested five years later in Welsh v. United States in which the appellant sought to overturn his conviction by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for refusal to undergo induction into the Armed Forces. The High Court determined that the Welsh case was "factually similar" and "controlled by" the Seeger decision.46 Like Seeger, Welsh would only sign the Selective Service form after altering the language. Whereas Seeger crossed out the words "training and" in the phrase 43. United States v. Seeger, 60 Landmark Briefs and Arguments 1057. 44. United States v. Jakobson at 180, 187. 45. United States v.

Like Seeger, Welsh would not or could not either affirm or deny belief in a "Supreme Being. " The government argued that Welsh's objections to war were based on what the 1948 Universal Military Training and Service Act called "essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code," neither of which were grounds for exemption from military service. In light of Seeger's contention, however, that he had a "religious faith" not in a Supreme Being but in a "purely ethical creed," Welsh's refusal to characterize his beliefs as "religious" (at least in the sense of a belief in a Supreme Being) was not prima facie evidence that his views were not religious.47 On the contrary, because of the "parallel position" rule established by the Seeger decision, it was clear that an individual's belief might be considered "religious" even if the individual denied characterizing it as such. "In view of the broad scope of the word 'religious,' " wrote the Court, "a registrant's characterization of his beliefs as 'non-religious' is not a reliable guide to those administering the exemption."48 The Selective Service Board and the courts had been wrong in denying Welsh an exemption from military service solely on the grounds that he had claimed his objections were not religious. If an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nonetheless impose a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in war at any time, those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual "a place parallel to that filled by . . . God" in traditionally religious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as much entitled to a 'religious' conscientious objector exemption [6(j)] as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions.49 Hence, consistent with Tillich's expansive definition of religion, the Court chose to construe the notion of "an individual's relation to a Supreme Being" in terms which would permit even an avowed atheist protection of "religious" exemption from military service if the individual's beliefs were "ultimately" held, i.e., functioned in a parallel fashion to those practiced by orthodox believers. In the wake of the Seeger and Welsh decisions it became clear 47. Although Welsh originally denied belief in a "Supreme Being," he later asked his local Selective Service Board to expunge that statement from his file, leaving the matter "open to question." Welsh v.

Hence the citation of Tillich appeared in a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1979 which did not involve the law governing conscription nor even the Free Exercise Clause but rather raised questions about the interpretation of religion under the Establishment Clause. In Malnak v. Yogi, it was alleged that the introduction of instruction in Transcendental Meditation in New Jersey schools was, in fact, an establishment of religion, despite the denial of its religious character by representatives of the TM movement. Although the court held that certain aspects of TM, as taught in the schools, were manifestly religious, e.g., the practice of puja (the Hindu veneration of the teacher or guru), the court also cited the ultimate nature of the ideas cultivated by instruction in meditation. Taking the lead from the High Court's Seeger and Welsh decisions, the court of appeals noted that "expectations that religious ideas should address fundamental questions is in some way comparable to the reasoning of the Protestant theologian Dr. Paul Tillich, who expressed his view on the essence of religion in the phrase 'ultimate concern' . . . Thus, the 'ultimate' nature of the ideas presented is the most important and convincing evidence that they should be treated as religious."50 The Malnak decision indicated that the federal judiciary had taken its cues from the High Court's conscientious objector cases and had incorporated Tillichian language as a means to read both the Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses more broadly. Despite the adoption of Tillich's concept of "ultimate concern" as a standard by which to judge religious belief (even when its "religious" nature was denied by its authors), some were alarmed at what they regarded as the semantic distortion of the term religion. Although Justice Harlan recognized the "plasticity" of the term "religion," he warned in his concurring opinion in the Welsh decision that the Court was descending into an "Alice-in-Wonderland world where words have no meaning."51 The use of Tillich's definition had distorted the term religion beyond all sense and certainly did not reflect the "Congressional intent" of the statutory language. Harlan voted with the majority not because he agreed with the Court's adoption of Tillichian language but because the religious exemption 50. Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F.2d 197 (1979), 208. 51. Welsh v. United States at 354.</page><page sequence="16">260 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE from military service constituted, in his view, "an establishment of religion." Nonetheless, Justice Harlan expressed concern that the adoption of such language was a dangerous precedent which would have problematic repercussions.52 Legal scholars have interpreted Tillich's notion of "ultimate concern" to mean that the cognitive substance of the term "religion" has been emptied. "This definition does not consider the content of belief nor is it interested in the institutional manifestations of a belief."53 In this "Alice-in-Wonderland world" where religion is stripped of cognitive meaning, how can "ultimate concern" distinguish between religious and non-religious belief? "The word 'concern,' " concludes one commentator, "denotes the affective or motivational aspect of human experience. The word 'ultimate' signifies that the concern must be of an unconditional, absolute, or unqualified character . . . every person has a religion."54 Critics therefore argue that the thrust of Tillich's argument yields the metamorphosis of any seriously held political, sociological, or philosophical belief into a religious one, undermining the very meaning of the statute in the conscientious objector cases. Tillich's definition of religion appears to be so broad as to obliterate any distinction between religion and nonreligion. Tillich himself reasoned that this seemingly all embracing notion of religion, described as the dimension of depth itself, is the foundation for the "narrower concept" of religion, recognized in the traditional faiths.55 52. Justice Harían was not alone in his reaction to the Tillichian language of "ultimate concern." Christian theologians and philosophers of religion raised questions about the validity of Tillich's thought. Neis F. S. Ferré argued that Tillich's work was "pseudo-theological." "Tillich and the Nature of Transcendence," Paul Tillich: Retrospect and Future (New York: Abingdon Press, 1966), 15-16.

The word "religion" appears only once in the religion clauses, and it is only logical that the term has the same meaning in each clause. Yet, such an assumption has been open to question in legal journals, particularly since the Tillichian definition of religion as "ultimate concern" provides an unexpected twist in its application to the Establishment Clause. In contrast to the modern Court's emphasis on a "high wall of separation" between church and state, conservative secular and Christian critics of the Supreme Court have argued that the First Amendment prohibits only the establishment of a state religion. "The language of the establishment clause," wrote one conservative Christian legal scholar, "was directed against the Congressional creation of a national church or favoritism of one ecclesiastical authority over another."56 According to attorney John Whitehead, director of the conservative Christian Rutherford Institute, the Founding Fathers envisioned a society characterized by a legally recognized "denominational pluralism" which welcomed religious practice in the public realm, as long as no one sect was officially sponsored by the state.57 Taken from Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association, the concept of a "wall of separation" 56.

Shepherd and James McBride, eds., Cults, Culture and the Law: Perspectives on the New Religious Movements (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985). These conservative secular and Christian critics of the Court have received verbal support in recent times from an unexpected quarter, the United States Department of Justice. Based on his own judicial philosophy of the "jurisprudence of original intention," Attorney General Edwin Meese has argued against the "evolution" of constitutional law and has affirmed his personal agreement with those who limit the Establishment Clause to the question of a "national church" or "state religion." According to this "jurisprudence of original intention," the Establishment Clause restricts only the federal government with respect to a "state religion" and allows states to determine for themselves the question of religious practices in state-sponsored institutions and activities. See Edwin Meese, "Interpreting the Constitution," USA Today, September 1986.</page><page sequence="18">262 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE between church and state was first invoked by the High Court in the Reynolds decision (1878) as "almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment."58 Although the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses were incumbent only upon the federal government during the first one hundred fifty years of the Republic, the Court saw fit to interpret the First Amendment guarantees as being equally incumbent upon the states in the Cantwell v. Connecticut decision of 1940. "The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as the Congress to enact such laws."59 Based upon the Reynolds and Cantwell decisions, Justice Hugo Black articulated their logical consequences in the Everson v. Board of Education decision (1947) by concluding that the Jeffersonian principle of strict separation impeded both the federal and state governments from passing legislation which would "aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another."60 The position of the Court was later confirmed in the McCollum v. Board of Education ruling (1948) in which it was reiterated that the Establishment Clause betokened more than a prohibition against a state church. It insisted upon the complete separation of the state and religion. In applying these standards of constitutional interpretation in Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), the Warren Court held that "religious tests" as a qualification for public office were a manifest violation against constitutional precedent of the Establishment Clause. The "secular reach" of the First Amendment, as Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the McCollum decision, penetrated the very notion of the state61 and led to the famous "school prayer" cases of the 1960s in which the Court held that government could not "sponsor" religious practices, even if (in conformity with the conservative Christian constitutional principle of "denominational pluralism") they were "non-denominational."62 Hence, the constitutional perspective of the Court seemed to fit the principle that what is permitted under the Free Exercise Clause must necessarily be prohibited under the Establishment Clause. The Court sought to translate the "secular reach" of the Establishment Clause into a constitutional standard by which government programs could be 58. Reynolds v. United States at 164. 59.

Following in the steps of the Warren Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger set forth these criteria in the Lemon v. Kurtzman ruling. "First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal and primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . . . finally, the statute must not foster 'an excessive entanglement with religion.'1,63 Although the Lemon three-prong test was designed to provide a standard which would definitely ensure the "complete separation of church and state," conservative secular and Christian critics have suggested that, coupled with Tillich's definition of religion, the test proves the existence of a state-sponsored faith in the public school system: the religion of "secular humanism." In the Tor caso v. Wat kins establishment case (1961), the High Court had rejected traditional theistic concepts as determining the religious character of beliefs. Noting that other widely-recognized religions have nontheistic beliefs, the Court mentioned in passing the existence of a secular humanist faith which had been recognized as a legitimate religion in several free exercise cases, e.g., Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda and Washington Ethical Society v. District of Columbia.64 Critics found the inclusion of secular humanism as a religion by the Court in an establishment case constitutionally significant. As two of the most vocal legal spokesmen (John Conlan and John Whitehead) for the conservative Christian community have argued, "Although the court did not define 'Secular Humanism,' it is clear that Secular Humanism is a religious belief system subject to first amendment protection and prohibition"65— a conclusion based on the logical principle that what is protected under the Free Exercise Clause is prohibited under the Establishment Clause. In the establishment cases which followed the Torcaso decision, the Court proceeded with the "disestablishment" of traditional faiths by holding that school prayer and even Bible readings violated the principle of the "separation of church and state." Yet, Justice Tom Clark (who was to author the Seeger opinion in 1965) warned in the Abington v. Schempp decision (1963) against the dangers which "disestablishment" betokened. "[The] State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or 63. Lemon v. Kurtzman at 612. 64. Fellowship of Humanity v.

Whether one distinguishes between a "religion of secularism" and "secular humanism" or finds them identical, Justice Clark's incorporation of "ultimate concern" as the dispositive criterion in determining the religious character of belief in the Seeger decision indicates that "secular humanism" may be considered a religion if it systematically promotes "secular" values which are held with "ultimate concern" and "without reservation." Hence, if the meaning of religion is the same in both free exercise and establishment cases, e.g., Seeger and Tor caso decisions respectively, then it would seem that some government programs, ostensibly secular in intent, may in fact result in the establishment of a state-sponsored faith under the expansive definition of religion provided by Tillich's theology. Yet, in this respect, constitutional interpretation has encountered a "Catch-22." Under the Lemon test to probe for unconstitutional intrusion of religion into government programs, legislation must have a "secular intent," but it is precisely because of such "secular intent" held with "ultimate concern" and "without reservation" that secularism may be considered a religion, i.e., secular humanism. Such government programs, particularly in public education, therefore violate prongs two and three of the Lemon test ["neither advances nor inhibits religion"; "must not foster 'excessive entanglement with religion' "] precisely because they follow the first prong ["must have a secular legislative purpose"].67 Have we then descended into what Justice Harlan had called that "Alice-in-Wonderland world where words have no meaning"? Although Tillich's expansive definition of religion may be regarded as a flawed diagnostic tool which has led to unfortunate consequences, conservative Christian legal scholars have used this liberal theologian's ideas to attack the "institution" of secular humanism in the public schools as an establishment of religion. Because the Christian New Right tends to couch this "secularist 66. Abington v. Schempp at 225. 67. "Religious Activity in the Public Schools," 388.

The suggestion that government sponsored legislation and programs may in fact promote a "religion of secularism" is discredited as the rantings of extremists; yet, the knotty problem of the constitutional understanding of religion is not so easily dismissed. Despite the hostility of his commentary on Conlan and Whitehead's seminal legal article on secular humanism, Professor Robert Davidow, a faculty member at the Texas Tech School of Law, admitted that allegations of a secularist religion levelled against the state have a certain plausibility. "It may be true that if one defines religion to include any deeply-held belief, or matter of 'ultimate concern,' a governmental entity cannot avoid espousing, and hence, establishing in the broad sense, a religion or religions. It is difficult for a school, for example, to refrain totally from advocating such views as that it is important to respect the person and property of others."68 Other legal advocates of the conservative Christian community have suggested that such religious presuppo sitions of secular humanism are promoted through the humanist educational movement—a broad philosophy of education which has generated such programs as "values clarification" to encourage the development of children as morally autonomous agents. With an extensive literature, the movement has trained tens of thousands of American public school teachers in such educational approaches as "values clarification.""Humanistic Educational Programs,"argued one critic, "do touch on many ultimate concerns . . . [Although the philosophical movement of Secular Humanism does possess a limited institutional structure, the form of Secular Humanism promoted by Humanistic Education Programs is not easily identified by a narrow definition of religion; yet because Humanistic Education Programs attempt fundamentally to alter the moral orientation of children, they thus are at least arguably religious."69 It might be argued in rebuttal that there are several reasons why such a conclusion is illegitimate. The conservative Christian legal argument represents an unwarranted extrapolation of Tillich's concept of "ultimate concern" which distorts a useful insight into 68. Robert P. Davidow, "Commentary: 'Secular Humanism' as an 'Established Religion.' A Response to Whitehead and Conlan," Texas Tech Law Review 11 (1979):51, 54.

However, Tillich himself would seem to have anticipated this broader application of his concept of religion. "It gives among other things," he wrote in his book My Search for Absolutes, "a positive religious meaning to secularism, which is usually condemned in sermons and publications of the church."70 But despite Tillich's comment and the contention that "humanistic educational programs" are "arguably religious," it may be countered that humanist educators do not consciously design these programs to be religious and to construe them as such is a gross distortion of their intentions. As one legal scholar has concluded, "The characterization of a belief as religious would seem to be beyond the competence of anyone other than the adherent."71 Logically, teachers should be taken at their word that they do not intend to advance religion through such programs as "values clarification." Yet, although the Court is constitutionally impeded from declaring sincerely held beliefs of "ultimate concern" nonreligious, the Court may declare such beliefs religious, even if they are denied as such by the adherent. In the Welsh decision, the Court ruled that it could consider Welsh's moral objections to war religious even if he declared them not to be. "The Court's statement in Seeger that a registrant's characterization of his own belief as 'religious' should carry great weight, 380 U.S. at 184, does not imply that his declarations that his views are nonreligious should be treated similarly."72 Although the Welsh ruling, like its Seeger antecedent, fell under the auspices of the Free Exercise Clause, the 1979 federal case of Malnak v. Yogi applied the same standard to the Establishment Clause. Although the counsel for the respondent suggested that transcendental meditation was arguably nonreligious and should not be considered an establishment of religion, the Court found otherwise and excluded the program from the public school system.73 Hence, it would seem that, denials to the contrary, humanistic educational programs which promote values of "ultimate concern" to the state may be construed as the establishment of a state-sponsored faith. Although the paranoia of those who speculate about the existence of secularist conspiracies has done much to discredit the claims of conservative Christians, the deepest fears of evangelical and fundamentalist communities have been legitimated by this legal construction which applies Tillich's definition of religion to the 70.

Since secular humanism is alleged to be an establishment of state religion, constitutionally the courts have no alternative but to ensure that no one religion, e.g., secular humanism, is preferred over another, e.g., any of the Christian denominations or sects. "Therefore," wrote one sympathetic commentator, "it is only through a method that allows for the introduction of ultimate-value learning in the public schools that the objection that the neutrality test favors religions of secularism can be overcome."76 In other words, religious views of all stripes ought to be admitted in the public schools in the process of discussing values of ultimate concern and of providing moral education. If such a program is unworkable, George Marsden, the respected scholar of American fundamentalism, has suggested that the state should support a "pluralistic school system" (which includes both public and private religious schools) with public funds.77 "Ultimate Concern" as a Standard of Constitutional Interpretation Based upon a cursory reading of Tillich's theology and the dependence of Justice Clark's Seeger opinion on the citations of Tillich in the Jakobson case, it would seem that Tillich's notion of "ultimate concern" gives credence to conservative Christian allegations that secular humanism in the schools represents an establishment of religion. Yet, although his definition of religion provided the phenomenological basis for the Court's opinion, it is open to question whether the Court and consequent legal interpreters read Tillich carefully and whether they drew the proper conclusions 74.

As one observer prudently warned, "To extract from them [Tillich's writings] the phrase "ultimate concerns" [sic], and instruct judges to apply it as a legal formula seriously underestimates the subtlety of Tillich's thought and overestimates the theological sophistication of the participants in the legal process."78 Viewed in light of Tillich's ideas, the "sincerity test" by which beliefs are judged religious or nonreligious is conceived in the minds of justices and attorneys alike solely in terms of the "affective attitude" of the individual in question. Hence, any belief at all might be considered religious if taken "seriously without reservation" [Tillich, quoted in both the Jakobson and Seeger decisions] since the Court is ostensibly barred from distinguishing between "true" and "false" religious statements, i.e., from judging the validity of "cognitive content." Yet, does this interpretation of "ultimate concern" adequately reflect Tillich's phenomenological description of religion? Tillich's Systematic Theology (1951-1963) and his popular expositions of its central ideas, e.g., The Shaking of the Foundations, The New Being, The Courage To Be, The Dynamics of Faith, represent the culmination of his life's work on a comprehensive theologico-philosophical system begun in the 1920s at the University of Marburg. Steeped in the German Romantic philosophy of Friedrich Schelling on whom he wrote dissertations for graduate degrees in both philosophy and theology, Tillich publicly acknowledged his debt to his "intellectual father," particularly for Schelling's concept of God as the Überseiende ["being above being"], later translated by Tillich into the "God above the God of theism." According to Schelling, this "being above being" is the Unvordenk liche or the "unthinkable," i.e., "beyond thought." God is therefore inconceivable, not because God does not exist, but because God cannot be comprehended by human thought. God can only be alluded to as "Thatness"—what Schelling called the eternal Dass. Based upon German Romantic presuppositions, Tillich's "system" was influenced by the work of his fellow faculty member at Marburg, Rudolf Otto, whose book The Idea of the Holy was regarded by Tillich as a seminal work in the phenomenological description of religion. It is significant that Tillich explained his concept of "ultimate concern" in volume one of his Systematic in terms of Otto's phenomenological work.79 According to Otto, the "holy" or numen embodies a realm distinct from the profane or secular character of 78. "Toward a Definition of Religion," 90. 79. Systematic Theology, 1:215-16.</page><page sequence="25">PAUL TILLICH AND THE SUPREME COURT 269 everyday existence. The perception of the "holy" is characterized by Otto as a subjective "mental state" which is sui generis.*0 From this perspective it would appear that if religious belief is considered the acknowledged perception of the holy, then religion must be simply a matter of affective attitude. Such a view closely parallels the definition of religion provided by the nineteenth-century German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, i.e., that religion is a "feeling of dependence"; however, Otto strenuously disagreed with Schleiermacher and took pains to distinguish between Schleierm acher's definition and his own conception of the holy. "[T]he 'creature feeling,' " wrote Otto, is itself a first subjective concomitant and effect of another feeling-element, which casts itself like a shadow, but which in itself indubitably has immediate and primary reference to an object outside itself. Now this object is just what we have already spoken of as "the numinous." For the "creature-feeling" and the sense of dependence to arise in the mind, the numen must be experienced as present. . . . The numinous is thus felt as objective and outside the self.81 In distinguishing between Schleiermacher and his own definition of religion, Otto concluded that the affective attitude of religious feeling and belief is caused by what is perceived to be an "objective source." Hence, based on Otto's classical study of the phenomenology of the holy, subjective feelings or affective attitudes are valid as indices of religious belief only insofar as they reflect the substantial object of religious belief. Influenced by Otto's phenomenology of religion, Tillich's "ultimate concern" cannot be reduced to an affective attitude alone. As he explained in a series of lectures at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1963 (two years before the Seeger decision and his death), "ultimate concern" "indicates, on the one hand, our being ultimately concerned—the subjective side—and, on the other hand, the object of our ultimate concern."82 Hence, the concept of "ultimate concern" invoked by the Court cannot be reduced merely to an affective attitude as legal scholars and justices have implied. If Tillich's notion is to be spared violence, the Court must recognize that there exist two poles in "ultimate concern": objective as well as subjective. Does that suggest that this legal notion may be characterized by both affective attitude and cognitive content? But if cognitive content is recognized as an inherent element of "ultimate concern," does 80. Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy, translated by John W.

In order to determine the viability of "ultimate concern" as a judicial guide which falls within the bounds set by the Ballard decision, Tillich's analysis of the holy "objective" dimension needs to be examined carefully. "Holiness," wrote Tillich, "cannot become actual except through 'holy objects.' But holy objects are not holy in and of themselves. They are holy only by negating themselves in pointing to the divine of which they are mediums."83 To reduce holiness to the objects themselves, i.e., to cognitive contents, is to transform the holy into the demonic. In such a case, argues Tillich, holiness becomes idolatry. In criticizing cognitive contents, Tillich is not suggesting that a phenomenology of religion abandon the objective dimension for it is that which transcends both form and contents that stamps the holy with objectivity. What makes "ultimate concern" ultimate is not only the affective attitude of the believer but also the object of belief which transcends the form and contents of the empirically observable world. Tillich refers to this essential transcendent characteristic of the holy as the "Unconditioned," i.e., that which lies beyond the conditions of phenomenal existence. Although the objective character of religious experience is thereby maintained, i.e., one is "grasped" by something, the substance of that objective character cannot be reduced to specific contents since to do so is to negate its transcendence. Hence, the objective pole of religious experience can only be alluded to by its "thatness"— much in the same way as Schelling described the Unvordenkliche as the eternal Dass. If Tillich's concept of "ultimate concern" were to be applied as a standard in judicial interpretation, justices would not need to probe the particulars of religious beliefs but only the character of those beliefs in general, i.e., to determine whether the "ultimate concern" of the claim has an object which transcends the empirical form and contents of the phenomenal world. Although Tillich himself described secularism, humanism, and nationalism all as "quasi-religions," there seems to be no doubt that in making this distinction he is not distinguishing between "true" and "false" religion (proscribed by Ballard) but rather between religion and that which falsely masquerades as religion, i.e., nonreligion. And although it is clear that the Courts have no authority to probe the truth of religious beliefs, they have a constitutional responsibility to assess what are and what are not religious beliefs. If the Court's appropriation of Tillich's "ultimate concern" is 83.

Although humanist education and "values clarification" programs in the public schools treat moral questions, it is not clear from the materials and methods used in the classroom that such "secular humanist" agendas are advancing any truth claims about the objective nature of the transcendent. Indeed, teachers take pains not to make such judgments since it would violate the principle of moral autonomy—a principle encouraged by humanist education but which stands in direct opposition to the theonomous ethics of Tillich's "ultimate concern."84 As the dean of American ethicists William Frankena has argued, ethics is not logically dependent on religion.85 Hence, the discussion of moral values in a classroom does not necessarily imply the propagation of religion. Tillich himself distinguished between the religious ethics derived from a theonomous relationship with the "unconditioned" and the autonomous ethics of Enlightenment philosophy. He lamented the direction of American education since it seemed to be leading away from rather than towards consideration of the substance of "ultimate concern." "[Humanistic education] considers the human potentialities as expressions of man's being a mirror of the universe and its creative ground. When the religious substance of humanism disappeared, the mere form was left, abundant, but empty."86 Tillich feared the failure of humanism precisely because under the impact of the Enlightenment it had forgotten its religious, i.e., Christian, character. Its new form, what is now called "secular humanism," had divorced itself from the transcendent substance of the holy, only to be replaced with autonomous "forms" and "contents" of values. "Secularism," as he told his students at Santa Barbara, means turning toward the cultural productions of the finite. . . . The danger of quasi-religions, the element of danger in them is the potential emptiness, the loss of ultimate meaning. Because of the turning of the mind toward the production of cultural goods in autonomous ways—autonomous, again, in the sense of following 84. See, for example, the widely held "values clarification" textbook designed to introduce teachers to its methods, "In our society, families and organized religions will not allow the school to usurp their role and teach a particular set of values. Therefore, modern values education as it has evolved in the schools has, for the most part, emphasized the teaching of a process of valuing, rather than any one value or value system."

Whereas it was assumed that Tillich's idea of "ultimate concern" encompassed only an affective attitude (in which case anyone might be considered religious), the incorporation of Tillich into the American legal tradition provides an objective standard of "transcendence" as the criterion by which beliefs may be judged religious. For Tillich, the affective attitude of "ultimate concern" itself must be grounded in the transcendent reality of the "substance" which "grasps" the believer. The argument of conservative Christian lawyers that secular humanism constitutes the establishment of religion is missplaced since affective attitude alone is insufficient as prima facie evidence of religious belief. Such "quasi religions," beliefs that masquerade as religion, substitute finite forms and contents for transcendent substance. Far from confirming the religious status of secular humanism, the use of the "ultimate concern" standard confirms that humanism has lost its religious substance precisely because its secularization has resulted in a focus on forms and contents. Rather than being discarded as inherently flawed as some critics suggest, Tillich's definition of "ultimate concern" should be recognized not only as a useful elaboration of the Ballard standard of "sincerity" but also as a judicial guideline by which religion and nonreligion may be objectively distinguished. 87.
