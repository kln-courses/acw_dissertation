This book would be more complete if it included studies of them, as well as of the fu. Studies in Chinese Literary Genres is evidence of a generation's achievements, and also of its limitations. The editor mentions the "comparative approach" as a dominant feature of critical methods shown in these essays, but the kind of comparative approach often appears to be only rudimentary. In many cases, the array of parallels and contrasts does not enhance our knowledge of the subject. Sometimes the western counterparts brought in for comparison actually dilute the intensity of the Chinese originals. A great number of the references to western works are embellishing rather than illuminating. Most of the essays are inspiring not because of their "comparative approach," but because they penetrate the texts. Their authors have surpassed many of their predecessors and their work will be of enduring value to students of Chinese literature. C. H. WANG University of Washington, Seattle NATURE'S WORK OF ART: THE HUMAN BODY AS IMAGE OF TIIE WORLD. By Leonard Barkan. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1975. x, 291 p. This valuable study of the microcosm-macrocosm analogy traces the "history and varieties of one particular metaphor"-the human body as cosmic symbol- and investigates both its doctrinal origins and its "poetic use as a vehicle for a wide range of ideas." In Professor Barkan's opinion, the "most important attribute of the body as a metaphoric vehicle is that it is a complete and finite system, highly complex but at the same time familiar and immediate": a system "both exhaustive and all-inclusive," possessing "everything it needs and nothing superfluous." In consonance with this "sense of coherence and completeness" the author focuses his study on "the use of the human body in a complete and systematic way," the "creation of a system out of a group of parts, a system which is brought into paral- lel with another system postulated outside of man." The "concrete multiplicity" of man's body serves as the "vehicle for either concrete or abstract multiplicity in the world around him." Accordingly, in literature and philosophy alike, the human body possesses considerable range as metaphoric vehicle, inasmuch as it is "cap- able of subdividing its referent into a great number of parts, while at the same time controlling the total range by means of the body's essential unity." Because of this diversity in unity, and unity in diversity, the system of the human body forms "the perfect vehicle for allegory." Stressing the Renaissance concern with men as "multiple rather than single beings," Professor Barkan argues that "in order to depict man as a creature of great complexity and multiplicity, poets fixed upon the image of his multiple body and used it to subdivide him." In the philosophical tradition, "the thrust of the argument is away from man: human complexity is assumed, and the body is used rather as a figure for the world's complexity, whether cosmic, political, or architectural." In the poetic tradition, on the other hand, the "thrust returns to man, proving that the complexity of the human body and of the worlds analogous to it are figures for the multiple nature of man himself." The first three chapters explore the intellectual background of three facets of 359</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE the microcosm-macrocosm analogy-the human body as symbol or model for the cosmos, for the commonwealth, and for architecture. In each of these chapters the author endeavors not only to trace the history of an idea but also to "suggest poetic techniques which the idea may have produced, and to read one or more im- aginative works in such a way that the history sheds light upon the critical reading and the critical reading upon the history." By combining the methods of history and literary criticism, he attempts to achieve "something midway between the two": the definition of "a habit of thought." In the first chapter, which begins with Plato and concludes with Donne's Devotions, Professor Barkan distinguishes four different approaches to cosmology which arise "from such speculation as Plato's and become the systems by which the bodies of greater and lesser worlds are united: the chemical geocosm, en- visaging a world composed of the four elements; the astral geocosm, presupposing a heavenly cosmos that is both physical and spiritual; a numerical geocosm made up of abstract mathematical relations; and a natural geocosm composed of the objects of this world as immediately beheld by the senses." Through the medieval period and well into the Renaissance these four systems "became increasingly syncretized and unified around the figure of man so that together they represented a microcosmic vision of man containing a vast but orderly quantity of the cosmos." In studying cosmology, the man of the Renaissance came "to know himself"; in understanding "the relations of like to like in the two worlds," he succeeded in grasping "self and world at once." The second chapter traces the "anthropomorphic vision of the commonwealth" from Plato through medieval and Renaissance writers to the "point where body politic, idealized body, and natural body are internalized" in such figures as the heroes of Jonson's Sejanus and Shakespeare's Coriolanus. In classical literature the image of the body was "idealized and rhetorical." The Pauline conception of the church as the mystical body of Christ nevertheless "suggested ways in which the body could be actually and dogmatically genuine," and during the Middle Ages the "analogy was realized in much more realistically corporeal terms at the same time as its actuality was believed and its potential for differentiation was increased." In Renaissance England, finally, the analogy possessed "all of these attributes. The idealized image for purposes of propaganda was at the same time a field for corporeal realism suggesting elaborate anatomies of the State and also a genuine image of the nature of world order-rather than a mere rhetorical device -to the Elizabethans." The third chapter traces the numerical and geometrical traditions concerning the human body and its shape and structure-and the architectural speculation associated with these traditions-from antiquity to the Renaissance, concluding with a discussion of the House of Alma in Book II of The Faerie Queene. Al- though the human body had been studied and measured as "subject and object for artists since the beginning of time," its aesthetics (Professor Barkan main- tains) first began to be "interpreted through metaphor and allegory in the high Middle Ages." Distinguishing two different kinds of allegorical reading in medie- val systems of measurement-"geometric and modular"-he argues that the two tendencies combine "when we investigate the philosophical principles behind the medieval allegorical system." Both delineate "unchanging principles which do not vary from man to man," and their canons of measurement are "the pictorial equiva- lents of the philosophical propensity for essence deriving from concrete specifics which is so characteristic of the medieval allegorical system." With the Renais- sance, however, the "unity and simplicity of human life as it appears in the medie- 360</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS val architectural analogy with the body" becomes transformed into a "multiplicity of derivations, parallels, and allegories." The "estheticians of the Italian Renais- sance derived the analogy through the scientific study of measure and proportion by which works of architecture could be simulacra of the body," and their ultimate source for "this scientific derivation of the analogy" was Vitruvius' De Archi- tectura. In his discussion of the "house poem" (which attempts to "capture the complexity and harmony of a single person in architectural terms") Barkan contributes fresh insights into Marvell's poem "Upon Appleton House" as a series of microcosms. Observing that the figurative "castle of the body" combines "architectural, political, and anatomical images to illustrate the complexity and harmony of man's overall moral condition," he regards Spenser's House of Alma as the culmination of this tradition: "perhaps the most acutely presented version of discordia concors in all of Renaissance literature ..." In the fourth chapter ("Astrophil and Stella: The Human Body as Setting for the Petrarchan Drama"), Professor Barkan emphasizes the "tension between fragmentation and union" in Sidney's use of the body image. In these sonnets the "most basic function of the body is as literal locus for the action," bridging the gap between "concrete narrative events and the abstract emotions which the speaker is undergoing." The body is "at once the metaphoric image of God's cos- mic wholeness and also a specific and unique part of creation, one which is literally very susceptible to immoral disorder." The final chapter ("The Faerie Queene: Allegory, Iconography, and the Hu- man Body") reconsiders the narrative and poetic texture of Books I, III, and IV of Spenser's epic "in the light of the notion that the world is a body and the body is a world." In "surface, structure, and meaning," the Faerie Queene is "contin- uously in flux from the One to the Many and back," and the poet's treatment of allegory and iconography reflects his emphasis on "methods which by their nature express unity and multiplicity at the same time . . " Whereas allegory suggests "at once the multiplicity of intricate analogical narratives and the unity of a hierarchic world view in which it is possible to build a poetic structure parallel to a divine or abstract structure," the iconographical method suggests at once the "multiplicity of interpretations and the unity of the object which is being inter- preted." In both cases the human body provides a "concrete basis for the method" inasmuch as the body "is that quintessential construct which is at once single and multiple." After discussing the motif of discordia concors in the Mutability Cantos and Spenser's praise of the "wholeness of the cosmos" in the account of Artegall's adventures, Dr. Barkan turns to the first, third, and fourth books of the poem as offering the "greatest range and interest for the subject of the human body as cosmic model and iconographic subject." The essence and uniqueness of Spenser's allegory resides in "'the endless flux from the single figure to multiples and back ... " The poem is "centrally concerned with the process of anatomizing and re- uniting," and the poet himself is "seeking not only the One but also the Many, for perfection in his terms is human and multiple at the same time as it is single and immortal." This book will be useful both to students of intellectual history and to special- ists in the literature of the English and continental Renaissance.
