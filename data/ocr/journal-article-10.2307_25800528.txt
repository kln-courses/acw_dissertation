Telegin1 Considerable progress has been made in the study of the Ukrainian Neolithic within the last 30-40 years. Some 500 settlements and more than 20 cemeteries are now known and show many features in common with Neolithic cultures elsewhere in Europe. The Ukrainian Neolithic can be divided into two distinct zones: the food producers (both agriculturalists and animal husbandmen) occupied the forest-steppe on the right of the Dnieper and in the western regions of the Ukraine; the hunter-gatherer-fishers occupied areas to the north and east. The early Neolithic lasted from the end of the eighth to the beginning of the sixth millennium B.P., and the food-producing economies seem to have spread from the south and west. The middle Neolithic lasted until the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.P. and overlapped in time with some of the Aeneolithic cultures. The Neo-Aeneolithic period includes only the last three-quarters of the fifth millennium B.P. KEY WORDS: Ukraine; Neolithic; food-production; chronology. INTRODUCTION It is conventional among archaeologists to consider as "Neolithic" those prehistoric sites in the territory of the Ukraine which characteristically con tain pottery but not artifacts of metal. The Neolithic of the area around the Ukraine shows a gradual transition from non-food-producing forms of economy, such as hunting, fishing, and plant gathering, to food-producing 1 Institute of Archaeology, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian S.S.R., Voudoubetskaya 40, 252142 Kiev, U.S.S.R. 307 0892-7537/87/090O-0307$05.00/0 ? 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">308 Telegin forms, such as agriculture and cattle breeding. In general, the Neolithic cultures of the Ukraine discussed in this paper are dated to the second half of the sixth and to the fifth millennium B.P. Neolithic sites of the area around the Ukraine were first studied at the end of the nineteenth century. A large number of Neolithic sites were excavated in the period between the two World Wars, including the first settlements in the Crimea such as At-Bash, Tash-Air, and Zamil-Koba 2, those in the upper Dnieper region such as Sredni Stog, Sobacki, and Vovnigi, Pestchanoie in the Volhynian region, as well as sites in many other regions of the republic. In 1930, Makarenko (1933) excavated the first collective Neolithic cemetery of the Mariupol type, in the pre-Azov sea region. It was also at this time that the first sites of the Linear Pottery culture (Linear bandkeramik or LBK), which is well known elsewhere in Europe, were discovered in the Dniester region (Torskoie) and in Volhynia (Baiev); the number of these sites increased considerably later (Passek and Tschernysh, 1963). Particularly significant contributions to the study of the Neolithic population of the Ukraine have been made since the end of World War II, that is, during the last 30-40 years. In 1946, field investigations were resumed in the upper Dnieper region, where Bodianski and Danilenko excavated Neolithic settlements on the islands of Shulaev and Surskoi. Artifacts from these excavations served as a basis for defining the Surskaia or Sursko Dnieper Neolithic culture (Danilenko, 1969). A number of new Neolithic sites were also investigated in the Crimea, including the Kaia-Arasy settle ment (Formozov, 1962), a burial near Dolinka village, and some local finds in the steppe Crimea and in the Kerch peninsula (Kolosov, 1972; Matskevoi, 1977). Artifacts from Kaia-Arasy and these other Neolithic camps in the Crimea were later used to define the Crimean Mountain Neolithic culture (Telegin, 1977; Kolosov, 1971). Significant progress has been made since World War II in the study of the Neolithic of the Desna River Valley, of Volhynia, of the upper Dnieper region near Kiev, and of the drainage basin of the Severski Donetz River, where a number of important settlements have been investigated. These include Cape Otchkinski, Pogorelovka, Mostva, Vita Litovskaia, Pustynka 5, Lisogubovka, Bondarikha 2, and Ustie Oskola 1 and 2 (Neprina, 1976). Based on material from these excavations, it was concluded that settlements in the forest-steppe on the left side of the Dnieper and those of the Polessye Ukraine region belonged to two different populations: to bearers of the Comb-Pricked Ware culture on the one hand and to bearers of the Pit-and Comb Pottery culture on the other. The Comb-Pricked Ware culture was later renamed the Dnieper-Donetz culture (Telegin, 1968), and our knowledge of it was considerably expanded</page><page sequence="3">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 309 by the results of investigations carried out by a number of expeditions headed by the author. This included the investigation of new Neolithic sites such as Buz'ki, Uspenka, Grini, Gastiatin, Shmaievka, and Kamienka. By this time also, Rudynski, Bodianski, Stoliar, Shaposhnikova, and Telegin had excavated some 20 large, Neolithic cemeteries in the Dnieper region, which were later called cemeteries of the Mariupol type (Vovnigi 1 and 2, Vasilievka 2, Marievka, Nikolskoie, Lysaia Gora, Dereivka, Jasinovatka, Kopulovka, and others.) Before World War II and beginning again in 1949, the first Neolithic settlements were excavated in the southern Bug region. Later, field investiga tions carried out by Kchavluk revealed several dozen new Neolithic sites in this area, most of which were excavated (Skibency, SokoPcy, Samcincy, Pecera, and so on). Using material from these excavations, Danilenko (1969) distinguished the South Bug Neolithic culture, which, after the discovery of identical sites in the Dniester region (Markevitch, 1974), was renamed the Bug-Dniester culture. For a long time, sites of only one culture (Tisza) were known from the Transcarpathian region. However, our knowledge of the Neolithic of this territory has been considerably enriched in the last 10 years, due mainly to the activities of Potushniak, who discovered sites of the Koros culture and of the Diakovo type (Potushniak, 1984). Thus, 60-70 years of investigation into the Neolithic of the Ukraine and of surrounding areas have led to the accumulation of a vast amount of material. At present, some 500 Neolithic settlements and more than 20 cemeteries are known and are attributed to a variety of archaeological cultures (Fig. 1). The quantity and diversity of material from these sites have allowed us to solve several important problems of prehistory, which are intimately connected with problems of cultural and territoral differentiation, the chronol ogy of cultures, the anthropological structure of ancient populations, and the principal forms of economy, art, ideological views, religion, and so forth. The general results of the study of the Neolithic of the Ukraine have recently been summarized by several scholars in the "Neolithic" section of the first volume of the Archaeology of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. We examine two aspects of this subject: a brief characterization of the Neolithic cultures and the determination of their chronology. All the Neolithic cultures of the Ukraine passed through a number of developmental stages and phases. Agricultural and cattle-breeding cultures appeared earlier in the south, whereas hunting and fishing survived until the end of the fifth millennium B.P. in more northerly territories. Because of this irregularity in historical development, the latter existed simultaneously with the Copper Age cultures of the southern territories. Thus, the chronology and periodization of the Neolithic of the Ukraine are tightly linked to the absolute dating of the Copper Age cultures of this territory.</page><page sequence="4">^// *"~" ~ ~~'?' ~~ ~~ ~~ ^ ~"~ 1^ Fig. 1.

Unfortunately, there is seldom a close correspondence between the actual dating of Neolithic sites and their periodization by archaeologists. There are particularly marked differences of opinion with respect to the problem of the earliest date for the Neolithic, which is assigned by some of the ninth millennium B.P. (Danilenko) and by others to the second half of the eighth millennium B.P. (Markevitch, Tringham, Telegin, and others). Many important differences of opinion exist concerning the problem of periodization of cultures. On the basis of the available information (dates) for Neo-Aeneolithic sites in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, there are three main periods, of which the first (I) is the early Neolithic, the second (II) is the middle Neolithic, and the third (III) is the Neo-Aeneolithic. The first and second periods may each be subdivided into two subperiods or stages: 1-1,1-2, II-1, and II-2 (Fig. 1). The first two periods cover about 1500 years each and the third period covers about 500-600 years. Changes in the economy and material culture as well as in the ethnic structure of the populations provide reliable criteria for these divisions into periods and stages. Radiocarbon dates, stratigraphic data, the study of cultural exchange imports (mainly pottery), and typological analyses of assemblages are the main sources for the absolute dating of cultures and for their periodization; the first archaeomagnetic dates are also now becoming available. THE EARLY NEOLITHIC The first period of the Neolithic extends from the end of the eighth to the beginning of the sixth millennium B.P. At this time, early Neolithic cultures developed in the Ukraine, such as the Bug-Dniester culture, Koros culture, Linear Pottery culture, Surskaia culture, and Painted Ware culture. The Crimean Mountain Neolithic also developed in the first period, and there appeared the earliest Dnieper-Donetz settlements in the Dnieper region. The Bug-Dniester Culture The Bug-Dniester culture occupied the middle reaches of the south Bug and Dniester rivers, where more than 60 settlements and sites have been discovered (Danilenko, 1969). This culture is characterized by pointed- and</page><page sequence="6">312 Telegin Fig. 2. Pottery (1-8), horn (10, 14), and stone (9, 11-13) artifacts of the Bug-Dniester culture.

Two main forms of pottery are present: a black, burnished bowl and a vessel which is usually richly decorated with linear (meanders, spirals, and vertical zig zags), pinch, and rarely, comb-impressed patterns. Bug-Dniester culture tribes created a particular spiral-meander style of pottery decoration, in which the principal motif consists of an elongated, curvilinear composition, with dots or strokes filling the pattern (Fig. 2: 1-8). Flint artifacts are microlithic and include scrapers on flakes, trapezes, and other forms (Fig. 2: 11-13). Stone axes are also found (Fig. 2: 9) as well as numerous horn mattocks (Fig. 2: 10 and 14). This culture dates from the end of the eighth to the beginning of the sixth millennium B.P. The Bug-Dniester culture settlement at Soroki II, in Moldavia, has yielded two radiocarbon dates (from the Berlin Laboratory) of 6495 B.P. ? 100 years and 6830 B.P. ? 150 years. There are three main periods in the development of the culture: early (pre-Samci), middle (Samci), and late (Savranski) (Telegin, 1977a). According to Danilenko (1969), these periods can be further subdivided into a number of phases.</page><page sequence="7">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 313 The Bug-Dniester culture appeared at the end of the eighth millennium B.P. but had developed for a long time under influences infiltrating from the Balkans and the lower Danubian region, which were inhabited at that time by people of the Koros culture. During the second half of the early Neolithic of the Ukraine, the direction of cultural contacts changed with the infiltration of a noticeable Dnieper influence into the southern Bug region. This is well reflected by changes in pottery decoration: in the Samci stage, geometric straight-line decoration, characteristic of the Neolithic of the Dnieper region, became widely used instead of the spiral-meander pattern which had been predominant earlier. At this time, the comb-stamp pattern also occurs widely across the southern Bug region, but its origins seem to lie in the Dnieper region. The gradual disappearance of "Balkan" traits in the culture of Bug Dniester people has been explained as reflecting the movement of the bearers of the early stage of the Dnieper-Donetz culture along the Dnieper River into more southerly regions. The people of the Bug-Dniester culture had domesticated animals (cattle and pigs) and cultivated cereals (wheat and barley) (Markevitch, 1974). The Koros Culture The Koros culture has been discovered in recent years in the Transcar pathian region by the work of Potushniak. At the settlements of Zastavnoie, in the Beregovskiy district, and Rivne, near Mukachevo, he has excavated traces of large pit-houses of this culture, both shallow and deep, and has collected many (about 20,000) artifacts. The pottery is of two main types: coarse ware and fine ware (Fig. 3:1-3). The coarse ware is made of poorly kneaded clay with sand and sherd tempers. There are three forms of vessel?a pot, a bowl, and a pan?which are usually undecorated. The fine ware is more carefully made. There may be traces of lugs and the surfaces of the vessels are well smoothed. There are various forms of pots, bowls, and pans, with flat bottoms or sometimes with a ring bottom, and lids. Fine ware is richly decorated with pinches, imprints or ear like patterns, and barbotine. Some of it is of particularly high standard of manufacture. It is thin walled, covered with slip, frequently well glazed, and often painted black. Other artifacts include clay spindle whorls, loom weights, beads, colanders, models of dwellings, animal figurines (wild boars), and female figurines. The latter are of two types: realistic and schematic, in the form of a plate with facial features (Fig. 3: 7). Stone tools include ground or polished pieces [polished axes (Fig. 3: 5), adzes, and querns] and flaked obsidian (knives, scrapers, and chisels). Points and trapeze-like microliths are also found (Fig. 3:4), as well as horn and bone</page><page sequence="8">314 Telegin 5 Fig. 3. Pottery artifacts (1-3, 6, 7) and stone tools (4, 5) of Koros culture in Transcarpathia. Provenance: 1, 3, and 5, Zastavne; 2, 4, 6, and 7, Rivne-Kish meze I. mattocks. The settlements have also yielded fragments of clay and tuff bracelets, which are trihedral in cross section, and clay amulets (Fig. 3: 6). Using the artifacts described above from Zastovnoie and Rivne, plus those from Mectelok and Satmar in eastern Hungary and from Le{ in Romania, Potushniak distinguishes an independent upper Tisza group of the Starcevo-Koros culture. On the basis of material from Mectelok, it is possible to determine that the bearers of this culture practiced agriculture and bred domesticated animals, mainly sheep and goats. Sites of the upper Tisza group are dated to the first half and middle of the seventh millennium B.P. They are therefore partly contemporaneous with the Starcevo-Koros culture of the Danubian region and preceded the Alfold Linear pottery sites in the Tisza River region. Potushniak considers that the</page><page sequence="9">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 315 appearance of the upper Tisza group is connected with a direct intrusion of bearers of the Starcevo-Koros culture into the Tisza River region. Titov (1980), however, considers them to result from the "peripherization and impoverishment" of the Starcevo-Koros culture. The Linear Pottery Culture (LBK) The Linear Pottery culture occupied the western parts of the Ukraine and the Volhynian region. Some 40 sites have been found there, including such settlements as Nezvisko, Tarskoie, Kotovanoie, and Gnivada; two cemeteries have been found at Nezvisko and Baiev. This culture is known from a very wide area of Europe and penetrated into the Ukraine in a fully developed state, perhaps from the territory of modern Poland. Two types of ware are characteristic: fine ware and coarse ware (Fig. 4: 1, 3, 4, and 6). The fine ware is thin walled and well smoothed and occurs in the form of hemispherical, flat-bottomed bowls. The decoration consists of curvilinear motifs; lines often form curved bands, and the "music-note" motif (Notenknopf) is formed by diametrical incisions across these bands. The coarse ware is tempered with burnt organics and has molded decoration. The stone artifacts include small, flint knives (Fig. 4: 2) and scrapers and shoe-last axes (Fig. 4: 5 and 7); many sickle inserts and querns have also been found. Unlike other Neolithic sites in the Ukraine, Linear Pottery culture settlements have yielded spindle whorls and loom weights, indicating the knowledge and ability to spin and to manufacture fabrics. The economy of the Linear Pottery culture people was based mainly on agriculture and cattle breeding: this is one of the "mature" agricultural and cattle-breeding cultures of Europe. Anthropologically, the Linear Pottery culture tribes are of the Mediterranean type. They were of middle height, with thin, graceful features, narrow faces, and elongated skulls. They buried their dead individually in pits, lying on their sides in a contracted position and sprinkled with powdered red ocher. Pottery and tools were included as grave goods. The Linear Pottery culture tribes inhabited the Volhynian and Dniester regions for several centuries, but their culture disappeared at the end of the seventh millennium B.P., leaving no noticeable traits in the later cultures of the area. Sites of the Diakovo Type in Transcarpathia After the period of Koros (that is, in the second half of the seventh millen nium B.P.) in the valley of the River Tisza in Transcarpathia, archaeologists</page><page sequence="10">316 Telegin Fig. 4. Pottery (1, 3, 4, 6), flint knife (2), and stone tools (5, 7) of the Linear Pottery culture. Provenance: 1, 3, and 4, Nezvisko; 2, 5, and 7, Zviniatchin; 6, Toskoie. have distinguished the so-called Alfold Linear Pottery culture, as well as a number of types or groups of sites, such as Satmar, Silmeg, Szakalhat-Lebe, Estar, and others (Titov, 1980). The same situation occurs in the adjacent territories of Czechoslovakia (Radzovce, Kapusiany, Barca III) and of Romania (Ciume?ti, Let 0- In general, these sites belong to the second half of the early and middle Neolithic of the Carpathian Basin. Unfortunately, the chronological positions of the sites are very unclear: they are assigned by some to the Alfold Linear Pottery culture (Kalicz and Makkay, 1972), while others consider them to be separate historic phenomena (Titov, 1980). The post-Koros sites of Transcarpathia have similarly received different inter pretations. Thus, Potushniak attributes them to the Painted Ware culture, while Titov includes them in the Alfold Linear Pottery culture or Satmar group.</page><page sequence="11">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 317 The most completely studied site of the middle Neolithic of Transcar pathia is the eponymous settlement near Diakovo village, near Monditchtog, where Potushniak has excavated two pit-dwellings, 1m deep and some dozens of square meters. Dwelling structures and refuse pits have also been discovered at other settlements of the Diakovo type: Drysino-Balotsa, Ushgorod-carier, Kholmtse-Karan, Maylie Gaievtsi, and Rivno-Kish meze 2. The pottery complex of these sites consists of two characteristic groups, the coarse kitchen ware and the thin-walled fine ware. The main forms of the kitchen ware are a pot, a bowl, and a pan, the last two sometimes of considerable size, with cross sections up to 70-80 cm. Decoration is poor and includes incisions and imprints across the rim, finger pinches, and strings of half-beads. The fine ware is well baked, often burnished and covered with slip. The typical vessel forms are pots, bowls, pans, and beakers, including hollow-footed beakers (Fig. 5: 1-3); there are also some subrectangular bowls. The entire surfaces of these vessels are usually painted black. Decora tive motifs include straight lines and meander compositions. A particularly characteristic ornament is made of bands with thornlike projections on their sides in the form of cactus spines. Relief ornament is comparatively rare. Flint was the main raw material for stone tools in Diakovo-type settle ments and was used for knives, scrapers, and chisels. There were also trapeze like microliths (Kholmcy) and points, as well as polished axes, adzes, and mattock heads. Occasionally, there are anthropomorphic vessels and figurines, including one in the form of the head of an old man with a wrinkled face. Most of the Diakovo-type sites were occupied in the second half of the seventh millennium B.P. Potushniak recognizes three periods of development and Diakovo itself is considered to be the latest settlement of this type. Their economy has received very little study but, by analogy, is likely to have been based upon agriculture and cattle breeding. The Surskaia or Sursko-Dnieper Culture The Surskaia or Sursko-Dnieper culture occupied the steppe region on the left side of the upper Dnieper, where more than 30 sites and settlements with characteristic pottery are known at present. The northern boundary of the culture area lay along the River Orel. A small settlement, including three shallow pit-dwellings, has been excavated on Surskoi Island in the upper Dnieper region. The remains of a similar dwelling were also found on Shulaiev Island. Pottery vessels have pointed bottoms and are dark gray in color with an admixture of shells and sand in the paste. The surface is slightly burnished, and decoration is in the form of lines, chevrons, and zigzags; there</page><page sequence="12">318 Telegin 3 Fig. 5. Pottery (1-3) and stone ax (4) of the Diakovo type in Transcarpathia. Provenance: 1-3, Rivne-Kish meze 2; 4, Kholmcy-Karan. are also incised lines and irregular pinches (Fig. 6: 1). The flint artifacts are microlithic scrapers and knives (Fig. 6: 3, 4, and 9). Geometric microliths occur, but very rarely; other stone artifacts include ax-adzes (Fig. 6: 5) and digging tools. A particularly characteristic feature of the Sursko-Dnieper culture is the everyday use of stone vessels (Fig. 6: 2). This does not occur in any other Neolithic culture of eastern Europe. The tribes of Surskoi Island subsisted primarily on the upper Dnieper's very rich fish resources, although they also were acquainted with domestic animals such as ox and pig. Their tool kit is designed principally for a fishing economy. Bone-working reached an apogee in the Sursko-Dnieper culture in the manufacture of tools such as fishhooks, harpoons (Fig. 6: 6-8), and</page><page sequence="13">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 319 Fig. 6. Clay pot (1), stone vessel (2), ax (5), flint artifacts (3, 4, 9), and bone tools (6-8). Provenance: 1, Striltchaia Skelia; 2-9, Surski Island. daggerlike objects. Polishers and fine examples of needles were also made of bone, and some of the artifacts are considered to be needles for net-making (Fig. 6: 7). The Sursko-Dnieper culture has no equal in the Ukraine in the high standard of manufacture and the variety of its bone tools. The Sursko-Dnieper culture dates to the beginning of the sixth millen nium B.P. It may have developed locally out of the Dnieper variant of the Kukrek Mesolithic culture. The Mountain Crimean Culture The Mountain Crimean culture occupied the mountain pasture areas on the first and the second ridges of the Crimean mountains, where more than 10 settlements have been found. The most important artifact collections of this culture were excavated from shelter sites, such as Tash-Air (Layers VI and Va), Zamil-Koba 2 (Layers VI and V), and the lower layer of Kaia-Arasy</page><page sequence="14">320 Telegin Fig. 7. Pottery (1-3) and flint artifacts (4-7) of the Mountain Crimean culture. Provenance: Kaia-Arasy sites. (Krainov, 1960; Formozov, 1962). From the excavated artifacts it is possible to distinguish two stages in the development of the Mountain Crimean culture. The first stage is represented by the lower (VI) layers of Tash-Air, Zamil-Koba 2, and the single-component sites, such as At-Bash, Balin-Kosh, and Denisovskaia. Pottery was not common at this stage. Vessels were made of poorly mixed clay with sand or, in some cases, crushed shells in the paste. They have pointed bases and are undecorated (Fig. 7: 3). The second stage of the Mountain Crimean Neolithic is represented by a large number of camps with considerable inventories. Typical pottery of this stage comes from the lower layer of Kaia-Arasy, Layer V* of Tash Air 1, and Layer V of Zamil-Koba 2. Sites such as Ulu-Uzien, Kurtsy, and Simferopolskaia may also belong to the same stage. The pottery forms of this stage were more developed. Many vessels are decorated with linear patterns (Fig. 7: 1 and 2), although the paste, as in the early Neolithic, is tempered with an admixture of fine quartz sand or crushed limestone or shells. Vessels have relatively thick walls (1-1.2 cm). Most have pointed bases, although several sites of this type (Ulu-Uzien) yielded flat-bottomed vessels. Rims are either smooth and even, rounded, or thick and flared outward. The most common vessel forms are wide-mouthed conical pots with pointed bases and weakly developed wall profiles. Their surfaces are well smoothed and unmarked. The decorative motifs are mainly incised lines, but impressed and</page><page sequence="15">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 321 pricked pits also occur. The arrangement of the ornaments on the vessel is not completely known but included borders and bands of rows of incised lines in vertical and oblique directions. Sometimes several wide, smooth, vertical lines were drawn under the edge of the rim. The linear patterns were accompanied by rows of pricks and impressed pits. On the Zamil Koba 2 pottery, the rows of impressed pits are considered to be independent com ponents of the pattern. There are a few differences between the flint complexes of the first and those of the second stages of the Mountain Crimean culture. The character istic blade industry of this culture generally includes a considerable number of geometric forms (Fig. 7: 4-7). "Mesolithic" forms, such as segments and trapezes with a steeply retouched side, predominate and there are also trapezes and segments with semisteep retouch and backed trapezes. The last variety, however, forms only a minor portion of the trapezes and is completely absent from Tash-Air. Points made on blades by complete, bifacial retouch are also characteristic artifacts of this stage; sometimes the blade is retouched only on the ventral face. Of significance in this culture is the appearance of hoelike horn artifacts, with a socket for the shaft. Hunting and gathering were still important parts of the economy of the Mountain Crimean culture, but the people were also acquainted with domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, and dogs. There is little information concerning the absolute dating of the Mountain Crimean culture, but it might date to the second half of the seventh and to the sixth millennium B.P. Summary The cultures and sites of the first period of the Neolithic of the Ukraine and surrounding regions discussed above were not contemporaneous. The Koros culture and early sites of the pre-Samci stage of the Bug-Dniester culture are attributed to the first subperiod (1-1), whereas the Linear Pottery, Painted, and Surskaia cultures and the later phases of the Bug-Dniester culture are attributed to the second subperiod (1-2). Sites of the Dnieper Donetz culture appeared at the end of the second subperiod. The absolute age of the sites of the first subperiod is estimated on the basis of radiocarbon dates from the Bug-Dniester sites (Soroki II) and their contemporaneity with the Koros culture of the Danubian region. The dating of the Linear Pottery culture is also quite reliable, since there are many radiocarbon dates available for it. The dating of other cultures and sites of the first period rests upon the basis of typological comparison with more reliably dated complexes.</page><page sequence="16">322 Telegin THE MIDDLE NEOLITHIC The second (middle) period of the Neo-Aeneolithic sequence of the Ukraine and adjacent areas is generally dated from the sixth to the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.P. (Fig. 1). By the time it began, most of the early Neolithic cultures described above were extinct; instead, the first Aeneolithic cultures, such as Cucuteni-Tripolye, Gulmenija, and others, appeared. The middle Neolithic of the region includes the florescence of the Dnieper-Donetz culture, and we may also attribute to this period the Tisza culture of Trans carpathia and the oldest sites of the Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture in north eastern Ukraine. The Dnieper-Donetz Culture The Dnieper-Donetz Culture is found on the left side of the Dnieper River Valley in the Ukraine and in the middle reaches of the southern Donetz River; about 200 sites and 20 cemeteries are known. There are also many sites of this culture in southeastern Byelorussia. The most fully studied sites in the Ukraine include Sobacki and Volcok on the upper Dnieper, Bondarikha in the southern Donetz region, Buz'ki in the middle Dniester region, and Mostva in the Volhynian region. Many cemeteries of the Mariupol type have been excavated, including Mariupol, Nikolskoie, Vovnigi 1 and 2, Vasilievka 2 and 5, Jasinovatka, Dereivka, and Osipovka (Telegin, 1968). Dnieper-Donetz culture pottery is represented by thick-walled pots; small bowls occur only in a few sites in the Volhynian and Kiev regions. The paste usually includes vegetable temper?quite considerable amounts of it occur in the early stages of the culture's development; mineral tempers were rarely used. Vessels with pointed bases are common in regions such as the southern Donetz, the Ukrainian Polessye, and Byelorussia; flat-based forms appear in the later stages. Pointed- and flat-based vessels existed simul taneously in the middle reaches of the Dnieper, but the latter were predomi nant in the upper reaches of the river (Fig. 8: 1, 2, 9-12, 47 and 48). Decoration usually covers the whole surface of a vessel and consists of comb impressions (usually of a fine comb), rows of horizontal V's (Furchenstich), and incised lines; there are always one or two rows of deep conical pits under the rim. Other types of decoration are rare. Pottery at some of the latest sites in the Kiev region has cord impressions and a string of half-beads under the rim. The flat bases are often decorated (Fig. 8: 10) with a motif of straight fines and herringbone patterns. This system of geometric ornament lasted throughout the whole period of the Dnieper-Donetz culture, although there</page><page sequence="17">nepw? k e pa m i Ka k a mI h b k p e m i h t&gt; *y*li p""' Z Fig. 8.

The flaked stone tools include bifacially retouched artifacts such as axes, arrowheads and spearheads, and microliths, scrapers, knives, and awls (Fig. 8: 4-8, 19-35, and 50-56). Microliths are numerous and varied and include symmetrical and asymmetrical trapezes, backed trapezes, truncated blades, and backed blades. Scrapers are the principal tool form and are usually rounded and on flakes. Knives are made on blades with one or both sides retouched. Arrowheads and spearheads are usually triangular with straight, concave, or convex bases. Flaked axes are found mostly in the Severski Donetz and Volhynian regions. On the basis of the manufacturing technique and the shaping of the blade, they are divided into three types: tranchets, choppers, and wedgelike axes (glut). The wedgelike axes were often polished. Adzes, mace-heads, and the so-called shuttles (Fig. 8: 3, 13-18, and 49) are made of ground stone, and the surfaces of the adzes and shuttles are well polished. They occur principally in the upper reaches of the Dnieper and are rarely found in more northerly regions. The shuttles, the purpose of which is still unknown, are usually made of talcum slate. They are oval in plan, with a semioval cross section, and vary in length from 5 to 20 cm. All of them have a deep transversal groove. They have been considered to be polishers or grinders or tools designed for smoothing out seams. The Mariupol-type cemeteries of the Dnieper-Donetz culture are communal. They are usually situated beyond the limits of a settlement; they often include only a few dozen graves but sometimes have more than a hundred (Dereivka, Nikolskoie, and Vovnigi 2). About a thousand graves have been investigated thus far. The dead were buried lying in the extended position on their backs in a large communal pit and were sprinkled with ocher. The grave goods include tools and ornaments (Fig. 8: 36-46). Broken pottery has been found inside some of the cemeteries (Nikolskoie and Lysaia Gora) and is explained as the result of sacrifices at the funeral feast. Anthro pologically, the bearers of the Dnieper-Donetz culture belonged to the late Cromagnon type and were a tall, broad-faced people (Konduktorova, 1956; Kiebiets, 1966). Three main stages may be distinguished in the development of the Dnieper-Donetz culture of the Ukraine. For the Byelorussian territory, Isaienko (1976) also distinguishes a latest, fourth stage. Sites of the second period are subdivided into three phases (Ila-IIc) and five local groups: the upper Dnieper-Azov group, the Cherkassy group, the Donetz group, the Kiev-Volhynia group, and the Gomel group. Danilenko and Tiurina con sider that sites of the upper Dnieper-Azov group and those of the Gomel group belong to different cultures. Titova, on the other hand, suggests that</page><page sequence="19">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 325 all variants of the Dnieper-Donetz culture represent different cultures, but that together they form the Dnieper-Donetz ethnocultural assemblage or complex, which includes a number of cultures and types of sites. To the sites mentioned above for the latest stage of the Dnieper-Donetz culture, we may also add Zasukhy on the left of the Dnieper and Pustynka in the Kiev-Chernigov Dniester region. Such sites as Strumelia-Gastiatina and Lisogubovka (Neprina and Beliaiev, 1974) should perhaps also be included in the Dnieper-Donetz ethnocultural complex. The age of the Dnieper-Donetz sites and cemeteries is established primarily on the basis of synchronization with the Tripolye culture (Telegin, 1968). For example, a vessel from the Borisovka site in Nikolskoie cemetery (stage lib of the Dnieper-Donetz culture) can be correlated with the end of stage A or beginning of stage Bj of the Tripolye. The finding of imported Tripolye pottery at Pustynka settlement 5 (stage III of the Dnieper-Donetz culture) and the considerable influence of the Tripolye pottery-making tech nology on Pustynka ware indicate that the third stage of the Dnieper-Donetz culture in the Kiev region was contemporaneous with Tripolye C. Tripolye sites of stages A-Q are dated by radiocarbon from the middle of the sixth to the end of the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.P. (Telegin, 1982; the dates are not calibrated). Therefore, the latest cemeteries of the Mariupol type (Nikolskoie and Lysaia Gora) may be attributed to the middle of the sixth millennium B.P., whereas settlements of stage III of the Dnieper Donetz culture (Pustynka 5 and Zasukha) date to the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.P. The Nikolskoie and Lysaia Gora cemeteries are the latest of the Mariupol type; we may therefore date all cemeteries of this type (stages Ila and lib of the Dnieper-Donetz culture) to the first half of the sixth millennium B.P. This conclusion is confirmed by the radio carbon dates for the Osipovski cemetery [5940 B.P. ? 420 years (Qi-517) and 6075 B.P. ? 125 years (Qi-519)]. If the second stage of the Dnieper Donetz culture began in the first half of the sixth millennium B.P., then its earliest stage should fall in the seventh millennium. There are some indica tions of contemporaneity of the early Dnieper-Donetz sites with the Samci stage sites, so that the earliest can be attributed to the second half of the seventh millennium. Overall, therefore, the Dnieper-Donetz culture existed from the middle of the seventh until the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.P. The main subsistence activities of the bearers of the Dnieper-Donetz culture were hunting and fishing, but the faunal remains show that domesti cated animals such as cattle, pigs, and caprovines were already known to them. Impressions of barley have also been found on pottery vessels of this culture from Vita Litovskaia.</page><page sequence="20">326 Telegii The Tisza Culture The Tisza culture occupied the drainage area of the River Tisza, mainly in Hungary and the southeastern regions of Czechoslovakia. A few sites of this culture have also been found in Transcarpathia, of which the most com pletely investigated is the Malaia Gora settlement, which lies within the limits of Mukatchevo. Artifacts of the Tisza culture and of the Cane-Ware culture were found in two layers of the Malaia Gora settlement (Potushniak, 1972). There were not large numbers of artifacts recovered from this site or from others in Transcarpathia with Tisza pottery, such as Beregovoie and Vlazy. Like Tisza sites in adjacent areas, the Tisza culture of Transcarpathia dates to the first centuries of the sixth millennium B.P. The Tisza pottery of Transcarpathia is represented by biconical vessels with mineral-tempered paste. The centers of the vessel walls are fired a darker color than the outer parts; the external surface of the pottery is reddish brown. The decoration is of incised lines, made with a pointed stick and covering the whole of the surface of the vessel. The motif is a very character istic and specific one, consisting of "angular" meanders and S-like figures. These are made in the form of two parallel lines with a clear band between them (Fig. 9: 1). As well as simple pots, there are also elongated pots with molded beads along the edge of the rim. Fragments of painted pottery of this culture are sometimes found in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Other ceramic artifacts at Malaia Gora included fragments of anthropomorphic figurines. Stone tools are represented by polished axes and adzes (Fig. 9: 2). No cemeteries of this culture have been found in Transcarpathia, although some have been excavated in Hungary and show a variety of burial practices. In the Neolithic and Aeneolithic of the Carpathian Basin, there are not only the usual burial form with the body lying flexed on its side (Kekengdome, Veste-Magar), but also burials with the body lying extended on its back (Kishkore-gat). On the basis of finds from the lower and middle reaches of the River Tisza, the economy of the Tisza culture included the cultivation of emmer and perhaps einkorn (T. monococcum) and the raising of domesticated pigs, goats, and sheep (the last were not common). Summary As can be seen from the outline above, the cultures of the second period of the Neolithic of the Ukraine were not all contemporaneous. The Tisza culture and sites of stage Ha in the Dnieper-Donetz culture are placed within the first subperiod (II-1). The second subperiod (II-2) includes later sites of</page><page sequence="21">z /8 4b 00 J. .. . LS -b .L .%&amp;. !^ - 1P .1 Fig. 9. Clay pot and stone ax of the Tisza culture.

THE NEO-AENEOLITHIC The third period of the Ukraine Neolithic, the Neo-Aeneolithic, is rather short (the last three-quarters of the fifth millennium B.P.). Only one Neolithic culture, the Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture, continued to develop in the Ukraine; in Byelorussia, the latest sites of the fourth stage of the Dnieper Donetz culture were occupied. The Pit-and-Comb Pottery Culture The Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture occupied the whole northeastern part of the Ukraine as far as the southern boundaries of the forest-steppe zone. Some 40 sites have been found, situated along the banks of the Desna, Seim, Southern Donetz, Worskla, Psla, and Suly rivers. About 10 sites have been excavated, including Pogorelovka, Skunosovo, Vlyntsevo, and Mys Ockinski. No cemeteries are yet known within the Ukraine, but a few related Pit-and Comb Pottery culture burials have been investigated in the Volga-Oka drain age area. The dead were buried lying extended on their backs, accompanied by adornments made of animal teeth and flint tools. The pottery is rather primitive, and vessel forms are limited to ajar with a pointed base (Fig. 10: 1). The paste includes mineral tempers. The entire surface of the vessel is usually covered with decoration in the form of horizontal rows of deep pits with a rounded edge and similar configurations; sometimes the rows of pits alternate with rows of comb impressions. The flaked stone tools are macrolithic (Fig. 10: 2-4, 6,10, and 11), they are usually made on blades and include scrapers, knives, chisels, and awls. Bifacial, elongated, pointed-oval, or subrhomboid arrowheads often occur and there are many axes. The latter are of various types but usually tranchet like or wedgelike. They are bifacially flaked; polished axes appear only in the later sites. There are also numerous bone artifacts in the Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture complex, such as multiple-barbed harpoons, arrowheads with biconical head, adzes, and fishhooks (Fig. 10: 5 and 7-9). The Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture in the Ukraine dates to the second half of the fifth millennium B.P. Telegin distinguishes two stages within its development, while Neprina (1976) sees three stages. The subsistence bases of the bearers of the Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture were hunting, fishing, and gathering. Neither domesticated animals nor cultivated cereals were known.</page><page sequence="23">Neolithic Cultures of the Ukraine 329 Fig. 10.

CONCLUSIONS There are many specific features in the development of Neolithic cultures in the Ukraine and in surrounding areas which are reminiscent of the cultures of other European territories at this time. As in Central Europe and western Asia, the Neolithic cultures of the region can be divided into two distinct zones: agricultural and animal breeding on the one hand and gathering hunting-fishing on the other. The boundary between the southern agricul tural and animal-breeding cultures and the northern gathering-hunting fishing cultures passes through Europe and Asia from northwest to southeast,</page><page sequence="24">330 Telegin from the northern part of France through northern Central Europe, Poland, the Ukraine, the lower Don region, the Volga region, and Central Asia. In the Ukraine, the agricultural and animal-breeding cultures include the Koros, the Bug-Dniester, and the Linear Pottery cultures, sites of the Diakovo type, and the Tisza culture. They are distributed in the forest-steppe on the right of the Dnieper and in the western regions of the Ukraine. The characteristic features of the southern agricultural and animal-breeding cultures are the predominance of flat-based ware (round-based ware is rare) with linear decorations, including spiral meanders, the presence of painted pottery and of polished stone axes, and burials with the dead lying flexed on their sides accompanied by pottery vessels. Anthropologically, the people of the agricultural and animal-breeding zone were of the Mediterranean type. The gathering-hunting-fishing populations occupied the northern and northeastern regions of Europe and Asia. Among the Neolithic cultures of this zone in the Ukraine and adjacent areas are the Pit-and-Comb Pottery culture and the Dnieper-Donetz culture. The Surskaia and Mountain Crimean cul tures might also be assigned to this zone, since gathering, hunting, and fishing remained the most important subsistence activities, although like the Dnieper Donetz culture, they practiced some rudimentary forms of food production. Unlike the agricultural and animal-breeding cultures, the gathering-hunting fishing cultures are characterized by the presence of pointed-based pottery, which was usually decorated with a stamp ornament (pits, comb, or pricks). Flint axes were not polished and played an important role in everyday life. Microlithic artifacts were widely used. Their dead were usually buried lying extended, on their backs, and were never accompanied by pottery vessels as grave goods. The people of these cultures were mainly late Cromagnons. During the early Neolithic of the Ukraine, most of the territory was inhabited by populations of southern origin. In the middle Neolithic period (sixth millennium B.P.), these were largely replaced by the late Cromagnon population of the Dnieper-Donetz Neolithic, who moved along the Dnieper into the southern region as far as the Crimean steppe. With the beginning of the Aeneolithic and the appearance of the Copper Age cultures, the reverse process took place and populations of southern origin moved into the Dnieper River regions earlier inhabited by Cromagnons (Tripolye, Sredni Stog). During the later history of the Copper-Bronze Age population in the Ukraine, both of these anthropological types, late Cromagnon and Mediter ranean, were present. REFERENCES Danilenko, V. N. (1969).
