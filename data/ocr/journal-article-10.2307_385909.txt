An earlier theory by L. Jordan has lanier2,3 derive from lanierl, claiming that the profession of the lanarius was held in such low esteem in feudal society that the word came to mean vil. Following Mme E.-G Lindfors-Nardin, the author refutes this origin for lanier2,3. He disposes of lanierl as being unrelated to lanier2,3 and concerns himself henceforth mainly with lanier2,3. As suggested by L.-N., lanier3 probably represents an early calque: ane (duck) + -ier &gt; *anier created to translate the germanic anothapuh (anot = duck, hapuh = generic term for hunting birds) attested among other texts in La Loi des Bavarois (ca. 728), with the addition of a prosthetic definite article. To sup- port this theory E. cites several parallels: epervier &lt; sparwarius, grue + -ier &gt; gruier (crane-hunting bird). Lanier3 is thought to have been created during the period 800-1000 and conveyed then presumably its basic meaning of "duck-hunting bird." Used to qualify the falcon which primarily hunted ducks and other smaller river birds, faucon *anier came to signify a special kind of falcon. The ellipsis of faucon accounts for the use of *anier as noun. By the time the word appears in medieval French literature (ca. 1180) the article is affixed. The step of the agglutination of the definite article is the hardest part to accept. Aware of the difficulty, E. offers as reasons chance, the existence of the homonym asnier, its obscure meaning due to the disappearance of ane, the need to have a special name for the special kinds of falcons, and finally a single possible parallel: loriot presumably derived from aureolus. From its first appearance lanier has two distinct meanings, and E. shows that lanier2 derives from lanier3. Lanier3 (adj. and noun) used in its primary meaning signified a special kind of falcon: faucon lanier or lanier. It appears from contemporary treatises on falconry that the faucon lanier was considered a less noble kind of falcon because of cer- tain undesirable characteristics: it is slow, lazy and untrustworthy. From these associa- tions evolved a new word lanier2 which eventually freed itself completely from the world of falconry and ornithology to enjoy a short and not very distinguished career pri- marily as a fill-in word of pejorative value in later epic poetry. The medieval poetic practice of using synonymous pairs of qualifying adjectives helped to establish the fol- lowing meanings of lanier2: 1. mauvais, vil and failli. 2. couard. 3. vilain, antonym of chevalier. 4. lent, paresseux, faible, and finally, derived from this last meaning, the expression lanier de = lent (a faire quelque chose), even negligent. The meaning of cruel proposed by Scheler is discarded. In the course of the study light is thrown on other related problems of semantics such as the special meaning of gruier = gentil, a meaning derived from the quality of the falcon trained to hunt cranes. This special meaning is easily acceptable in the light of its frequent use in opposition to the term faucon lanier. The argument for the development lanier2 &lt; lanier3 is convincingly presented. E. sees the expansion of the semantic field from bird to man, when used in the figurative sense, as natural in view of the habitual medieval anthropomorphic interpretation of animal behavior; cf. hagard and niais, which have passed into the common vocabulary from ornithology. E.'s examination of the rhymes in the later rearrangement of older epic songs proves that the fairly extensive use of the word in the late 12th and early 13th centuries is closely related to the introduction of the rhyme. Rarely used in interior position, lanier provided a welcome fill-in rhyme in -ier, and thus found its place in the formulaic vocab- ulary of the later epic poets in expressions like ne pas (mie) avoir (le) coeur lanier, tenir pour/d lanier. The use of lanier2,3 in the other genres is very restricted, and it seems clear that lanier never became part of the common vocabulary. This is probably due to</page><page sequence="3">470 FRENCH REVIEW its social restrictions, falconry being an exclusively noble pastime, to its rather vague semantic content, and finally to possible confusion with its homonym lanier1. In the early 13th century lanier2,3 seem to have enjoyed more common usage in the northeast of France. Modern Picard "paresseux comme une ene" and "quelle anette!" (personne paresseuse) can possibly be traced to *anier. After a brief revival in the works of Baudouin and Jean de Conde (early 14th century) lanier falls into disuse and there are no examples found in the literature after 1400. The various spellings of lanier are discussed in the appendix. The author completely fulfills his promise to present a study in lexicology conforming to the standards of modern linguists.
