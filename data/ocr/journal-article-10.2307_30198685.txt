More and more Johann Nestroy is coming into his own as a dramatist. Both of these works aim to demonstrate his individuality, one in relation to the Viennese Comic Theatre, the other in relation to the source of one of his plays. Siegfried Diehl shows that the magic apparatus, so dear to the Vien- nese Volkstheater, becomes in the early Nestroy an instrument for social satire that represents the collapse of traditional values in Vienna in the nineteenth century. After an introductory section dealing with the Viennese "Zauberstiick" in general, Diehl proceeds to discuss all of Nestroy's early plays, even the most trivial. He shows how the early parodies mock their romantic subjects and reduce traditional magic to comic silliness. In Die Verbannung aus dem Zauberreich the magic spirits have become ineffective. To be sure Nestroy has carried the traditional anthropomorphism of the "Feenreich" to its limits by making these spirits as helpless and foolish</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 89 as mortals. In Die Zauberreise in die Ritterzeit a journey into the past re- veals, not the expected romantic middle ages, but a medieval world iden- tical to the Viennese "Vormlirz" which the travelers had tried to escape. Diehl insists that this is not the customary Biedermeier admonishment to accept homey limitations, but a recognition that there is no escape from the dreariness of the present. If anything, it is a travesty of Biedermeier morality. In Der bilse Geist Lumpazivagabundus and the plays related to it (Genius, Schuster und Marquer, Der Feenball, and Die Familien Zwirn, Knieriem und Leim) we see a thoroughly decayed fairy-tale world, one that has become a caricature of itself, "a persiflage of classical transcen- dence." In Der Feenball particularly the spirits are passive spectators of events on earth; they must even depend on natural means, such as peeking through cracks in the door, to keep abreast of events in the world of reality. The world is no longer governed by these magic spirits, and all their at- tempts to improve the human race are doomed to failure. According to Diehl, Nestroy is not deliberately trying to break down Raimund's ideal world, but he is revealing the emptiness of the real world with its sentimentalities and superstitions: the breakdown of the magic apparatus is the corollary to all this. Nor are the characters Zwirn, Knieriem, and Leim descendants of the "Taugenichts" of Romanticism. Instead they are seen as men helpless before a world that has lost all mean- ing and seems to be on the verge of disintegration. They would seem to be more likely ancestors of Beckett's Estragon and Vladimir. All that is left for them is their doubt of the beyond and the necessity, not the moral value, of accepting the real world. There is no ideal life, and even the acceptance of everyday reality has no positive reward. Then Diehl proceeds to a thorough analysis of two misunderstood plays, Der konfuse Zauberer and Der Zauberer Sulphurelectrimagnetiko- phosphoratus, based on manuscripts discovered since the historical-critical edition of Fritz Brukner and Otto Rommel in 1924. Karl Kraus had already called attention to the brilliance of Der konfuse Zauberer in his adaptation of it in 1925, but Diehl seems to be the first to point out the value of Der Zauberer Sulphur... In analyzing these plays he observes that the pub- lished texts are based on versions which were watered down, not only for the censor, but to make some of the roles suitable to the harmlessly silly Staberl comic tradition. The published versions represent Director Carl's intentions more than Nestroy's. This analysis also gives further evidence of Kraus's critical insight into Nestroy: Der konfuse Zauberer, which Kraus admired so much, emerges in the original manuscript as the best of all of Nestroy's "Zauberstiicke," superior even to Lumpazivagabundus. Ultimately the magic in Nestroy is pure theatrical fantasy, its function is parodistic, showing that "deeper meaning" can no longer be taken seriously. The social satire in the plays is directed against those who live as though the world were the plan of benign spirits while everything around them suggests that it isn't. Especially when one considers the collection of</page><page sequence="3">90 Monatshefte aphorisms in Nestroy's Nachlap, it is clear that in his plays all transcendence is a joke, the life of his characters is a grotesque travesty of what they think it is, illuminated only by a satanic laughter. Nestroy's comic spirit seems closer to Baudelaire's and Wedekind's, as Kraus noted, than to the wistful gaiety of the Viennese Volkstheater. In comparing Der Talisman with its model, a trivial play called Bonaventure by two French writers named Depeuty and De Courcy, Leo Tiinz certainly proves that Nestroy is his own man as a dramatist. This type of comparison, however, reminiscent of that old Germanistik which always managed to prove that German versions were more profound and better than their foreign models, is not the most interesting way to do it. Furthermore there is no mention of a Master's Thesis cited by Diehl (Helmut Herles, Nestroy als Bearbeiter-gezeigt an einem exemplarischen Beispiel: "Talisman und Bonaventure," Frankfurt/M. 1966), which makes use of "Szenenentwiirfe" that ought to have been considered by T6nz. Finally it should be mentioned that this book is a photostat of a poorly typed manuscript, complete with official stamp and signatures of approving examiners.
