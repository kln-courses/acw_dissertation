      <p>The recent interest in the formation of national identities has led to a rediscovery by historians of the importance of the concept of “national character.” <italic>Italian Vices</italic> is a timely and welcome contribution to the growing literature that studies the self-images of nations. The title indicates a peculiarity of the Italian discourse on national character; the prevalence of negative stereotypes, often of foreign origin, but apparently internalized by Italian opinion makers. If Italy was unique, it was “a uniqueness fraught with liabilities” (7).</p>
      <p>Silvana Patriarca's learned and sophisticated work recounts how the discourse on national character evolved in parallel with the changing aims of elites involved in inventing and shaping the new nation. The origins of many of the current stereotypes about the Italian character go back at least to the sixteenth century. However, the perception of Italian decline changed both the context and the content of the discourse about Italian national character. With the rise of the industrious nations of the Protestant North, the trope of “Southern indolence” took on a new force, and the image of a people made lazy and overaddicted to sensual pleasure by the mildness of their climate came dangerously close to the image of the enervated Orientals for whom despotism was the only possible form of government. Still, even foreigners could not fail to recognize the past glories of Italy, at least under Rome, and so the explanation in terms of climate was never wholly convincing. A historical explanation that emphasized the evil effects of the papacy's encouragement of supine obedience and superstition catered to Protestant prejudices but also found an audience among Italian intellectuals from the Enlightenment onward—clerical education and absolute monarchy were described as “emasculating.” On a quite different cultural level, Sismondi provided an immensely influential and reasoned analysis of the forces that had robbed Italy of its cultural primacy. Yet he could not resist pointing to the prevalence of the <italic>cicisbeo</italic> or <italic>cavaliere servente</italic> as a proof of the immorality and effeminacy of old-regime Italy.</p>
      <p>The idea of national character and the need for its regeneration became part of the repertory of Risorgimento nationalism. However, I think quite rightly, Patriarca does not see a Herderian urge to establish national originality as the prime mover in the Italian case. The key question was not so much “How do we distinguish ourselves?” as “Why do we behave the way we do?” (11). When, in the late nineteenth century, Pasquale Turiello wrote that the inhabitants of the Mezzogiorno had preserved more of the original Italian character, he was not praising them for their unique essence but blaming them for their excessive individualism and “looseness”—that is, the refusal to be bound together by strong collective ties or discipline. The tone of the literature of national character is prevalently moralistic. It is true—and perhaps Patriarca could make more of this—that fears and denunciations of “effeminacy” and “idleness”—the two vices most often mentioned in Italian self-criticism of the late Enlightenment and Risorgimento periods—were not peculiar to Italy. They were commonplaces of a cultural critique of the mores of a nobility that appeared to have lost its military functions and that could also be accused of working against the national interest by the aping of French styles and fashions. The English emphasis on “manliness” and character had its origins in such a critique. Although Patriarca's analysis is set in a robust comparative framework, some more concrete examples of comparison would help readers distinguish more clearly what is specific to the Italian case.</p>
      <p>For Machiavelli, Italian “indolence” was associated with loss of the civic and military spirit of republican <italic>virtù</italic>. These were still key contrasts in the Risorgimento discourse. The recovery of manly honor through war was in origin an aristocratic motif, although during the Risorgimento heroism and self-sacrifice became democratic virtues. However, the Piedmontese nobleman Cesare Balbo, one of the most influential national propagandists, contrasted the indolence of the Italians of his own time with their past industriousness. This already implied the need for a new work ethic, although this motif became really dominant only in the writings of the 1870s and 1880s, once national unity had been achieved, when Samuel Smiles spawned a host of Italian imitators. Perhaps the most widely read was Michele Lessona, whose Smilesian collection of exemplary lives came out under the significant title <italic>Volere è potere</italic> (Where there's a will there's a way; 1869). More theoretical approaches, such as that of Turiello, do not seem to have avoided the risk of circular argument; they explained the failure of Italians to cooperate effectively via the scarcity of their propensity to do so. The belief that Italians were more “individualist” than were Northern peoples, which owed something to Burckhardt's ambivalent exaltation of Renaissance individualism, was a reversal of earlier views. “Familism,” though a contested concept, would seem to be a more adequate description. Ernest Gellner's arguments about the obstacles posed by “clan society” to the development of civil society could be relevant here. In the later nineteenth century, Italian writing about national character was influenced by the prevailing climate of positivism and tended toward a more racialist and determinist view of character, especially in dealing with the “Southern Question.” However, in commenting on the Neapolitan admiration for <italic>furberia</italic> (cunning), Turiello raised an important issue. Conceptions of national character, as Ralf Dahrendorf once argued, can influence behavior by providing role models and shaping expectations. It is easier to see how this works with positive stereotypes—like that of the “hardworking German”—than with negative ones. However, one could argue that the widespread belief that “we are a people of <italic>furbi</italic>” has a powerful feedback effect, discouraging cooperation. The persistence of this belief is exemplified, as Patriarca remarks, by the cult of Alberto Sordi, admired not just for being a great actor but for being the most faithful interpreter of the Italian character.</p>
      <p>Patriarca's analysis is wide-ranging and based on an impressive collection of texts. Readers might sometimes wish she had paused a little longer to discuss more thoroughly some of the more serious examples of the genre, such as Leopardi's <italic>Discorso sopra lo stato presente del costume degli italiani</italic>, even if, written in 1824, it remained unpublished for over eighty years. The decision to exclude fiction almost wholly was perhaps inevitable, but it does rob the story of a dimension. Edmondo De Amicis, the author of <italic>Cuore</italic> (1886), is well represented, but more could usefully have been said about the pedagogical aims (and popularity) of Carlo Collodi's <italic>Pinocchio</italic> (1883). Novelists and storytellers shape the conception of national character not so much through stereotypes as through representative “types”—for example, Manzoni's <italic>azzeccagarbugli</italic>, the image of the hairsplitting lawyer. But Patriarca would argue, I think, that her aim could not be so comprehensive. She has set out to tell the story of a discourse that has shown a remarkable capacity to reinvent itself in new forms, including both Fascist and anti-Fascist versions. It is hard to take issue with the author's conclusion that this discourse represents a simplistic and anthropomorphic form of self-criticism that often gets in the way of more serious analysis.</p>
