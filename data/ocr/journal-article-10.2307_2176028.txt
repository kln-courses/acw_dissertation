Pleasure is a peculiar psychological phenomenon. It has been far less exhaustingly studied than has Pain. There is only one extant theory, that of Wundt. The views of this psychologist and of Richet are open to criticism on many points. My own theory is as follows: Pleasure is a special sensation, and not a common sensation or a property of sensation in general. It is of the same nature as the special emotion of tickling (chatouillernent). [Charac- terization of tickling.] Pleasure is a diffused tickling, of slight intensity. - The following arguments may be adduced in favor of this theory: (i) Authoritative. (a) Descartes, so far as he has any definite view, tends to identify pleasure with tickling (titillation). (i) Bain emphasizes the role of contact in pleasure (sexual and maternal love, etc.). (2) Factual. (a) There are certain nerves, whose excitation gives rise neither to pleasure nor pain. These seem, then, to be special states. (i) Pleasure always implies cutaneous excitation. This is obvious (a) for the sensation of contact. It is hardly less so (/3) in the case of temperature sensa- tions. The common view that extreme heat and extreme cold are sensed identically is incorrect. (y) The same holds of non-retinal sensations of movement, whether of our own or of some other body. And the hypothesis explains (8) the pleasantness of certain tastes and (E) scents. [We may distinguish here between the agreeable and the pleasant, the disagreeable and the painful. Pleasure is 729</page><page sequence="2">730 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. agreeable, pain disagreeable; but not every 'agreeable' produces pleasure, and a 'disagreeable' need not be painful.] (I) The sounds which we emit are attended by mechanical excitations, not only in the buccal region, but often also over a considerable portion of the body. My theory explains the terms 'high,' low,' 'scale,' etc., as applied to sound. Deep notes should be theoretically the more pleasant: but association complicates matters. Heard sounds are pleasant or unpleasant through tactile association. (v) Visual sensations do not cause pleasure or pain: they are rather agreeable or disagreeable. Still, there is pleasure involved in the movements of the eyeball, in conjunctival excitation, etc. And association may be strong, - of easy or impeded movement, of 'warm' and 'cold' (in color), etc. (0) The internal or general sensations allow of ready subsumption to my hypothesis. All are probably reducible to special emotions, and in particular to different kinds of cutaneous sensa- tion. (c) A consideration of the emotion of joy gives support to the theory. Cf Lange's analysis. (d) So with the so-called ' higher' pleasures, which are psychologically identical with the sense-pleasures. - The will has been plausibly reduced to a sensa- tion-group. The question of pain-organs and pain-nerves has been carefully discussed. My aim has been the indication of an organic substrate and a sensory basis for pleasure. E. B. T. Thdorie vibratoire et lois organiques de la sensibili/r. J. PIOGER. Rev. Phil., XVIII, 9, pp. 238-262. (i) General ideas as to sensibility. Its general or synthetic study has been neglected. But this is important, because it is the study of the uninterrupted transition from objective to subjective phenomena. - We must not confuse Sensibility in general with Impressionability or general sensibility; we must not restrict it, either to the sensations of pleasure and pain, or to conscious sensibility. Sensibility is a modifiable term, covering a group of 'sensible' phenomena; it is a generalization or abstraction, which expresses the fact that living organisms react ' sensibly' to excitation, - the ' sensible' reaction being by differentia active or spontaneous in its lowest forms, perceived or conscious in its highest. -There is an intimate connexion in our minds between the idea of Sensibility and that of Essentiality. Cf. Cuvier. There are two tendencies. For some, Sensibility is the essential, an entity, as opposed to special sensibilities. Others analyze the former into the latter, its con-</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 73I stituents, desiring to discover the common element in them.- Always there is the difficulty that we cannot take facts as they are, but view them through the medium of our own mentality. - Sensi- bility is the animal attribute par excellence. We begin with the simple reactions of the proto6rganisms. And this is the last notion of Sensibility; contraction or movement in presence of an external or internal excitant. Consider the sensibility of an amoeba. - The relation of things to us must be kept in view: not us, or the things. Necessary to the production of Sensibility is the coupling of excitant (object) and excited (subject). This is fundamental. Cf. my work Le monde physique. - To define: Sensibility is reducible to the idea of the property, common to all living bodies, of reacting intrinsically upon every external or internal excitation, in the special way of function (physiological) or faculty (psychological), but always essentially in the form of a molecular modification which we must term vibration. (2) Vibratory theory of Sensibility. Consideration (a) of the ear; law of vibratory synchronism. (b) The eye; simile of organic photography. (c), (d) The current theories of olfactory particles and of gustatory chemistry are sub judice, and the verdict may be predicted to be against them. (e) For touch, which readily accords with the theory, see Le monde physique. (f) Temperature, the bridge connecting special with general sensibility, presents no difficulty. -The best idea of the phenomenon of objective Sensi- bility is that of a transmitted vibration, variously impressed on the molecules of our organism, the transmission being differentiated in direct ratio to our organic differentiation. Living matter is molecularly excessively unstable; hence its high sensibility. - In a word, Sensibility is Vitality. Only we express different modes of manifestation by different terms, and thus confuse words with things. Every reflex is a resultant of organic sensibility; and all life is a resultant of reflexes. - A crowd of problems is solved by the right definition and appreciation of Sensibility. Living matter becomes more complex, unstable and motile as we advance along the scale of life: hence, e. g., the greater sensibility of civilized peoples, of oppidans, of the rich. Our ' molecular' vibration is vibration within the limits of change of constitution: there are, i.e., in the universe, constitutive movements and vibratory movements, which must be distinguished. - Molecular motility increases with complexity and instability. We understand, then, the maintenance of the general organic equilibrium; we note the function of nervous specialization; we begin to grasp the genesis and mechanism of Sensibility proper,</page><page sequence="4">732 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. internal and psychical sensibility and consciousness. The ' sensible' reaction is the repercussion of a local modification on the whole, a necessary result of the equally necessary organic solidarity. And as we find in the physical world complications, interferences, polar- izations, so may there well be a similar play of action and reaction in the psychical. (3) Laws of Sensibility. Our leading ideas must be those of differentiation and incessant equilibration. And we distinguish dynamic modification of the organism (Sensibility proper) from organic (nutrition and organization; our general idea of Sensi- bility). So we have (a) the law of differentiation and (b) the law of organization. The dynamic is always tending to pass over to the organic, as is readily seen in physical examples. -The first law has many corollaries. Necessity of differentiation of an excitation in time and space. Perception of vibration-totalities or groups. (Cf Taine.) - A simple variant of (b) is (c) the law of habituation. And a fourth law is (d) that of the uniformization of Sensibility, implying the coordination of individuals to a whole, or the gradual attenuation of differences till there is a resultant fusion. - Funda- mental for consciousness, as for our mentality and knowledge, is differentiation. To repeat: Objectively there is necessary, for Sensibility, an intraorganic modification, extrinsically originated; this implies a general reaction to the local difference, - and this repercussion (generalized, analyzed, or redistributed by the nervous system) constitutes the subjective perception of the objective excitation. The intrinsic vibration (conscious perception) is subject to the same laws with objective Sensibility. Here is the key to many philosophic riddles, -subject and object, consciousness and subconsciousness, instinct and reason.- Every sensation (registration at tension in a nerve-cell of an external impression) is at once a gate of entry for any similar sensation, and a store of activity, to be increased or energized by its own repetition. Hence the possibility of education, and the complexity of our concrete mentality. E. B. T. The Psychological Basis of Hegelism. ALEX. FRASER. Am. J. Of Ps., V, 4, 472-95. The psychological process of apperception plays a very large part in the development of the sciences. The dominant scientific con- ception of an age tends to be carried into all realms of thought. All phenomena are interpreted in the light of this conception. In</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 733 Hegel's time the dominant conception was that of polarity, the attractive and repulsive agency manifested in galvanism. Chemical processes and the processes of life and thought were alike regarded as manifestations of electric agency. The same thought of polarity was deeply rooted in the philosophy of Schelling and Hegel, and they based all the sciences on it. In Hegel's Logic the one dialectical principle (positive, negative, indifference point) is over and over again repeated. This can best be seen in the doctrine of essence. The one passes over, not into any other, but into its own other. The opposition is real (not logical) polar opposition. "The conception of polarity," says Hegel, "which is so dominant in Physics, contains by implication the more correct definition of opposition." Schelling emphasized the identity or indifference-point of the magnet, Hegel the difference of the poles. Hegel applied the physical conception of polarity to the constitution of thought. The facts which Hegel seeks to explain are empirically arrived at and then interpreted and strung together by the principle of polarity or electric synthesis. The synthetic principle does not develop. The evolution is a repe- tition of the one principle, repeatedly read into experience. The real development is the movement from abstraction to the concrete forms of experience. In all the Hegelian categories the valuable thing is not the interpretation given, but the statement of the facts. The principle of polarity fails to explain things. With Hegel, Nature always remains irrational, and yet he maintains that it is ultimately rational. The principle which harmonizes Mind and Nature, the rational and the irrational, cannot be rational. It must transcend reason. It is the principle of polarity. Hegelism has value: first, in the facts which Hegel observes and the general conclusions reached; secondly, in showing, by breaking up the old hard and fast lines, not indeed the positive infinity, but the wonderful plasticity, of thought. Our main thesis suggests that all the great systems rest on psychological presuppositions. J. A. LEIGHTON. Origine et nature du movement organique. J. LOURY. Rev. Phil., XVIII, 7, PP. 32-55. M. Loury gives an account of the theories of Max Verworn in regard to the origin and nature of protoplasmic movement. Verworn distinguishes three classes of facts to be accounted for in the study of movement in unicellular organisms : (i) the formation of pseudo- pods, (2) phenomena of protoplasmic excitation, (3) phenomena of the degeneration of denucleated protoplasm. He offers a physico-</page><page sequence="6">734 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. chemical explanation of all these facts, the substance of which explanation is that all expansion, whether 'spontaneous' or in response to external stimulus, is due to the affinity of certain proto- plasmic particles for oxygen, which can be obtained only at the surface of the protoplasmic mass; while all contraction results from the opposite affinity of the most highly oxidized particles for the nuclear substance. A cell deprived of its nucleus disintegrates, because it lacks the substance which can give rise to the centripetal currents. Verworn, however, deprecates the exclusive importance ascribed by Kblliker and others to the nucleus, holding that the cell-body is equally essential. The same general principle of a protoplasmic affinity first for oxygen and second for the nuclear substance is used to explain all forms of organic movement. Each segment of a muscular fibre, for example, is composed of a layer of contractile substance between two layers of a non-contractile substance which is in direct con- nection with the surrounding highly nucleated sarcoplasm. An excitation causes the contractile substance to decompose. Like all highly oxidized protoplasm, it is strongly attracted to the nuclear substance, which can be reached only through the non-contractile layers on either side: hence the whole fibre is shortened. MARGARET WASHBURN. Der Blinde und die Kunst. FR. HITSCHMANN. V. f. w. Ph., XVII, 3, PP. 312-20. The author confines himself chiefly to a discussion of the signif- icance of poetry for the mental life of the blind. Blind persons are perhaps more receptive than others to the influence of psychological poetry. When poetry is descriptive of the phenomena of external nature, they must, of course, form make-shift images (Surrogat- vorstedlungen) of these objects. Their own poems on Nature show that these are oftentimes exceedingly minute and accurate. It is generally lyric poetry for which blind persons show greatest talent, but they are also much influenced by the dialogue. They ex- hibit an extraordinary susceptibility for rhythm, and are able to reproduce large portions of poems without any effort. In general, the fine arts (i) enrich the mental life of the blind by a host of ideas and sensations which nature would bestow neither in such rich variety nor with such force and liveliness; and (2) they enliven and ennoble his whole being, and at the same time extend and raise his mental outlook. J. E. C.</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 735 ETHICAL. The Relations of Religion and Morality. WILHELM BENDER. New World, II, 7, pp. 453-478. At the close of the Middle Ages men began to abandon theological foundations for law and morality, and sought to explain both exclu- sively from the nature of man and of society. Yet the emancipation of morality from religion was not then thoroughly accomplished, since the declaration that the moral law would preserve its validity, even if there were no God, was invariably accompanied by the assurance that it might be regarded at the same time as the expression of the will of God for mankind. Only when, after Schleiermacher, men began to understand the special nature and independence of religion, and to study it historically and psycholog- ically, were they prepared to determine its true relation to morality. Religion is neither the pure product of the human subject, nor the pure result of an influence working from without, but rather the product at once of outer forces and inward responsive action. It always appears in history as belief in powers operating upon man, to which he offers prayer and sacrifice in order to win their help and avert their punishment. He does not understand the nature of those conditions upon which the realization of his life depends, and finds his purposes thwarted or promoted in an inscrutable manner by overpowering forces. These incitements to the formation of religion are: objectively, the laws and forces of the universe; subjectively, our dependence on them and the necessity of subordinating our- selves to them because we cannot thoroughly understand and master them. These factors lead us to feel our weakness, our need of help and salvation, and concentrate desires and hopes and faiths upon the belief that, where our own insight and power fail, we may reckon upon the support of a general world-order in the fulfilment of our life interests, so far as these do not run contrary. Thus religion has no other origin than civilization has -the impulse to the preserva- tion and enrichment of life. But religion manifests itself in desire, in hope, in faith and prayer; civilization in productive, moral, and intellectual labor. Now as all human affairs are conditioned by a course of things superior to man, these religious prayerful desires will attach themselves to all forms of activity without distinction - the productive and economic, as well as the social and political. Hence religion stands in no closer connection with moral life than with the</page><page sequence="8">736 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. productive activities. Prayer for the needs of economic life arises with the same power when we have reached the limits of our own strength, as prayer for forgiveness when we have violated the moral order. The independence of morality and religion is made plain in three essential features. First: religious action, as faith and prayer, is distinct from the moral deed. Second: the religious act is con- nected with every activity, not merely with the moral. Third: the religious act is called forth not only by moral, but also by immoral efforts, as the history of religion shows. Now morality is to be explained purely from the interaction of man with man in social relations. There is, then, only one opening by which religion can enter the moral life: the supplementary sanctioning of custom, law, and morality, through which those moral regulations which have arisen naturally are designated as the laws of the world-governing power, a revelation of the divine will. Thus religion is not the pro- ductive and guiding power in moral progress. The moral law could develop itself independently, and had so developed before it received the religious sanction. On the other hand, morality influences religion in three ways. It is the social-moral necessities which call forth and condition the religious expression of duties and laws. Again, the collision into which man falls with the moral law furnishes the strongest incentive to the formation of religious views. Lastly, it is especially when we consider the progress of morals in its relation to the whole world-process that the necessity of a religious interpre- tation and foundation of this process comes to the front. E. L. HINMAN. Can Economics furnish an objective standard for Morality? SIMON N. PATTEN. Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XXII, 3, PP 322-332. This paper consists of a criticism of Spencer's theory of ethics, and an argument in support of an 'economic' theory-a system whose objective standard is deduced from the conditions deter- mining the 'food-supply.' The. 'greatest happiness' principle is assumed throughout. Spencer asserts that it is the business of moral science to deduce from the laws of life and the conditions of existence what kind of conduct tends to produce the most happiness and least unhappiness; and he holds the view of a pro- gressive evolution, during which pain is gradually eliminated, which has as its goal an ideal social state where pleasure is unalloyed with</page><page sequence="9">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 737 pain anywhere. But an examination of the conditions of existence, which Spencer neglects, shows that a progressive evolution is possible only in a world of change, and that the ideal social state is possible only in a world of uniformity, and consequently his theory is inap- plicable to the world which exists. An objective standard for morality may, however, be deduced from ' the external conditions of existence'; these conditions are mainly those surrounding the food- supply, and they must determine what are 'the highest types of moral action.' The greatest amount of happiness or pleasurable existence being the goal, the world must be filled with happy beings. But the number of these is limited by the conditions of the food- supply. Consequently, there is demanded the greatest economy in consumption and a maximum of production, and this latter require- ment implies the use of all land in the most productive manner. Thus a person's conduct is determined, 'in an objective sense,' by his demand for land, that is, by that kind of consumption which it requires a fewer or greater number of acres to supply, e.g., if an acre of land will produce the food-supply for one person in a year, and he consumes besides the produce of another acre in "liquor and tobacco," he is cutting off the existence of a fellow-being from the world. "Only that conduct can be absolutely right " which allows of these two ends: "the greatest economy of the food-supply and the use of all the land in the most productive manner." W. B. ELKIN. METAPHYSICAL AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL. Ein zinazifgekldries Moment in der kantisciten Philosophie. ROBERT HOAR. Phil. Mon., XXIX, 5 u. 6, pp. 278-291. This article puts the question: Was Kant a Mystic? Considerable highly interesting evidence is presented for both the affirmative and the negative, but no solution is attempted. Some time ago Carl du Prel published Kant's lectures on psychology together with an introduction: " Kant's mystische Weltanschauung." These lectures form a portion of a work which was published in 182i by K. H. Ludwig P6litz, entitled: " Immanuel Kant's Vorlesungen fiber Metaphysik." This work, as is explained in a quotation from its preface, was constructed from two manuscripts of notes taken down in Kant's lecture room-the first older, fuller, and without date,</page><page sequence="10">738 THE PHIL OSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. Ii. the second dated I788, and being on the broad margin by a second hand in 1788 or I 790 " theilweise berichtet, mehr aber noch erweitert und erganzt." P6litz considered that he had in these manuscripts the report of the same course of lectures given at three different times. In one portion of his edition of these lectures the first manuscript, and in another the second, had been made the basis, without any alteration by the editor except in the arrangement of the punctuation, the omission of an occasional superfluous aber or also, and the striking out of a few passages where the copyist had apparently missed the sense. Politz assures his readers that they have before them "the true Kant" in every line of the work. It is to be observed now that those lectures on metaphysics from which Du Prel extracts the mystical lectures on psychology had passed through four hands -the writer of the first manuscript, the writer of the second, the. writer of the margin of the second, and the editor, P6litz. A number of quotations from different parts of the work of 182i are given, which seem to show the absolute incapacity both of the original copyists and of the editor. The lectures on psychology in this work are indeed in the highest degree dogmatic and mystical. Can it be that we have here "the true Kant," as Politz asserts ? Quotations are given from Schulze, Borowski and Jachmann, which show that to his most intimate friends Kant never displayed the least tendency towards mysticism, although he seems to have been charged with such by some of his contem- poraries. Could these lectures be assigned to his early pre-critical years the discrepancies might be explained, but besides the date given by P6Xitz, Du Prel reports having examined a copy of a fragment dated 1788, and agreeing almost word for word with the text of P6litz' edition. There is a problem here that remains to be cleared up before we can be sure that we have "the true Kant." F. C. FRENCH. Die Religion der Wissenschaft. Eine Skizze aus dem philoso- phischen Leben Nordamerikas. PAUL CARUS. Phil. Mon., XXIX, 5 u. 6, pp. 257-278. This article, by the editor of The Open Court and The Monist, is intended to set forth to European readers the aims of the Open Court Publishing Company and the character of the 'religion of science,' for the establishment, development, and propagation of</page><page sequence="11">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 739 which this company was formed. By religion is here understood a world-view as guide to action. It has to do with the whole man; it is the sum total of his ideas as they affect his feelings and thereby determine his will; it is a matter at once of the understanding, the heart, and the practical life. The object is to retain all that is true and good in the old religions, and summarily to eliminate the errors; to establish religion on the verities of modern science rather than on the myths of a supposed revelation. The idea of developing out of the old religion a religion of science which shall recognize no revelation but the facts of nature is no more utopian than was in earlier times the idea of developing astronomy out of the superstitions of astrology or chemistry from the errors of alchemy. The philosophical principles by which the Open Court Publishing Company is guided may be expressed in two words: positivism and monism. By positivism is meant the principle that all knowledge is a description of facts. Laws of nature are formulas which describe the facts of a certain class with the greatest possible economy. Our abstract concepts represent, not metaphysical essences or forces which act upon things from without, but certain properties of the things. Our world-view must be built up on; such facts only as are indubitable and are always open to fresh investigation, and, further, to be regarded as indubitable, a fact must not come into contradiction with other facts. A description of all facts must form a unitary system, in itself congruent and free from all contra- dictions, i.e., a monism. Monism regards the world as an inseparable and indivisible whole, all different truths as so many different conceptions of one and the same truth. There is only One Truth, and this One Truth is eternal. Positive Monism can be called a new philosophy only in opposition to the philosophies which still think that there is a philosophical or metaphysical knowledge radically different from scientific knowledge. The last half of the article is given to a concise summary of the application of these principles to theology, ethics, and religion. The following subjects are treated in paragraphs of from one to two pages in length: The Data of Experience and the Soul; the Object and its Reality; the Unity of Subjectivity and Objectivity; One-sided Conceptions; the Ethics of the Religion of Science; Character of the Religion of Science.

The human mind is, to a great degree, the product of society. Therefore, to completely understand its nature, we must leave the individual standpoint and attend to the psychol- ogy of social man. We must consider races as great complex wholes. First in importance is the light that is thus thrown upon the action of our unconscious mental processes. What we can discover by introspection is soon exhausted, but the field of knowl- edge may be indefinitely extended when we infer from the phe- nomena of sense the nature of our own mental activities. For our sense world is not the world in itself, but only a group of images which are the product of our own inner life. We can, therefore, discover in it much concerning our unconscious soul-life, and, in this way, become more fully acquainted with our own inmost nature than we could by introspection alone. Ethnology also enables us to explain the origin of many concepts and notions that have hitherto been regarded as mysterious. I1. Epistemology. Ethnological studies furnish evidence from many fields to the fact that knowl- edge is the resultant of reciprocal action between the external environment and the human soul. III. Ethics. The first gain for which ethics must thank ethnological induction, is the proof which it furnishes of the complete relativity of the content of our moral ideas. The form of our moral consciousness -the ability to dis- tinguish right from wrong - may indeed in a certain sense be called a priori; but the morals of each individual are determined by the social organism in which he lives. From the point of view of ethnology the moral ideas of the individual are perceived to be the necessary result of the relations which he sustains to society. Ethnological sciences, and especially ethnological jurisprudence, show us that scientific treatment demands a purely objective stand- point, and that we should furnish explanations of the origin and nature of the various ethical notions and customs without any individual estimation of their moral quality and worth.

The ordinary a priori theory supposes, first, a</page><page sequence="13">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 741 concept, A, concerning which we make the analytic judgment "A is b + c." Here b + c may be considered as the analysis of a second or predicate A; hence the judgment "AS is b + c" presupposes the judgment "A4 is A." The steps of development are therefore as follows: 4, A - A (a simple reduplication), A is A, A is b + c. Since it is impossible to obtain the form of a judgment from the analysis of a mere concept, though reduplicated, and since "1A is A " is the primitive form of judgment, presupposed by all others, the principle of identity is a prior. To this theory E. grants that no analysis of a concept will give the copula. But we need not therefore despair of tracing the origin of judgment. Its source is simply the process of association by similarity. Resemblance is partial identity. When the child associates 4 with B on the ground of resemblance, he does so because he perceives in them a common element, a, and he tacitly affirms that a (in A) is a (in B). "; The association by resemblance and the judgment differ as the Cartesian obscure and clear idea, and what is clear in a judgment has been produced from an association by an ordinary and well-known mental operation, to wit, abstraction." What, then, becomes of the distinc- tion between analytic and synthetic judgments ? It practically disappears, for while every judgment -being the connecting of two terms-is a synthesis, it is when compared with the general idea, 4"4whose point of departure is also association by resemblance," an analysis. For the general idea is a fusion of elements, while to make a judgment it is necessary to extract a simple element from the genus. As for association by contiguity, its result in consciousness is a simple enumeration, it never gives the copula. It may be objected that even at the beginning of speech a distinction is made between "A is B " and "Ae is like B "; the latter expression being a secondary form of the first, having as predicate the class "like B." To this it is answered that the beginning of speech is not the beginning of thought, but so much later that the original habit of uniting indi- vidual to individual by means of the copula has already yielded to the tendency to generalize. The further objection that enumeration of resembling objects is as natural as enumeration of contiguous objects is met by distinguishing between "natural contiguities" of space and time, which can only be enumerated, not united by the copula; and "artificial contiguities" of resemblance, which may indeed be enumerated, but which also furnish material for a com- plete judgment.

Psychology is the basis of Philosophy. Mind is a 'permanent possibility' of movement. Knowing and feeling exist for doing and the capacity for doing. Muscular strain is the starting point of Philosophy. The standard is impulse, the basis of will and work. The criterion is catholic human instinct. Ejective philosophy seeks its leading principles in the philosophy of character and religion. It will exalt aesthetic anthropomorphism. Philosophy is represent- ative and therefore elective. Man is not objective (matter), not subjective (feeling), but elective, self-objective, actively personal. J. A. LEIGHTON. Suir l'origine de la vie terrestre. SULLY PRUDHOMME. Rev. de Met. I, 4, pp. 324-345. Naive notion of children ascribes life to everything which seems to feel, think, and act voluntarily. With them sensation, especially that of pain, is the most patent characteristic of life. Later under the influence of observation and study, the way of regarding it is changed, - becoming at once narrower - wider. Purely physio- logical life is distinguished from psychical. Scientists ascribe to the phenomena of consciousness (sensation, ideas, will, feeling) a character which cannot be reduced to definite properties by the so-called natural sciences. This character of psychical life does not take into account at all the metaphysical question of the relationship between physiology and psychology. Scientists confine themselves to the determination of the relationship of phenomena of the two forces of life, leaving aside the metaphysical question of the relation of their essence. In the vegetable the organic seems entirely separated from the psychical life, owing to the lack of a nervous system. In the development of forms according to inherited types, nutrition and reproduction are the only characteristics which these two kinds of life have in common. No germ continues to exist at the high temperature the earth must have had in its evolution (in the theory of Laplace), and we must therefore regard life as having been generated by a particular collocation of certain mineral elements. But the conception of the germ as made up alone of physico-chemical elements differentiated by the manner of arrange- ment does not accord with the data of experience and observation.</page><page sequence="15">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 743 The body known as germ reveals an action which is not explicable by physico-chemical forces -e.g., vegetable growth counteracts the force of gravity. The force which realizes the type of a plant is different from anything we know of the mineral elements. The work of Pasteur has overthrown the hypothesis of spontaneous generation of life, formerly held by Pouchet, and has shown that life presupposes always a germ or elementary organism. But if spontaneous generation is impossible, when or how do these organisms arise? In the author's hypothesis the appearance of the first living cell is explained as the initial attempt of the principle of life, whose activity up to this time has been impersonal, latent, unconscious, to become individualized in organizing itself. The organism may be regarded along with the principle of life as a condition of feeling, for every sensation presupposes an impression and every impression an organ. It is for this reason that there is no occasion to ask what has been the effect of extremely high temperature of the earth on the principle of life prior to the appearance of animal and vegetable forms. This effect was zero by reason of the lack of organization. The work of the principle of life existed only potentially, not actually. The principle of life in the author's hypothesis is, like gravity, a force revealed by its effects; its action exists in a potential state before being manifested without, and its development was from the simplest rudimentary form up to the stage of consciousness.

The fundamental law which furnishes the primitive idea of all mathematical notions is, at bottom, an extension of the relation which the well-known principle of the conservation of energy supposes, unlimited extension, for this law applies to all orders of physical phenomena. Reduced to its simplest and most general expression, it means that for a change to take place in a "continuous and isolated " material system, it is necessary that this system be heterogeneous, and that the like homogeneous elements of which it is composed be not all in the same state. The cause of every change, then, is a difference of state, just as the cause of every manifestation of energy, is an absence of equilibrium. It results from this law of the association of like elements that, in the particular case of the association of two bodies in different states, two phenomena and only two are possible, according as the total change with which</page><page sequence="16">744 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. the system is affected takes place simultaneously in both bodies or in only one. We conceive, in the first case, a series of changes which mutually determine each other, and in the second case a change which may take place in one of the bodies without a corresponding change taking place in the other. The opposition between a symmetrical and an asymmetrical relation, both reduced to a common term, becomes the foundation of a new kind of relation, the relation of the finite to the non-finite, these last words serving to designate two correlative attributes, i.e., the places of the two terms in the relation. But this asymmetry which gives rise to the non-finite, has a definite sense relatively to the common term, a sense defined by the relative role of the unique body whose state is not modified in spite of its association with another body. This unique body, indeed, may be either the body taken as a standard or the body compared, and that allows one to conceive the existence of two joint asymmetrical relations of opposite import with regard to the common term, a system which gives rise to another kind of relation, that of zero to a finite quantity. These last words designate, moreover, two correlative attributes, two aspects of the relation. This common origin of zero and of infinity involves, as regards that which more particularly concerns infinity, the following consequences, already admitted for zero. Infinity is conceivable, like zero, as expressing a particular, relative position of its object, considered as a term of a certain rational system. Infinity may be conceived as the attribute of objects finite and limited in their other qualities. But while a negative concept in so far as it is a species of the genus non-finite, it is positive in so far as it is a species of the great genus which includes finite and non-finite, by which genus a change, simple or double is affirmed. It should be added that this change is always a finite, limited change, and that thus an infinite does not rest upon any other infinite. The infinite is not, as one would be tempted to think a priori, a complex, formed of the infinites of space, or of time. The infinite may be composed of finites, and its primitive elements are not only real, but finite. Finally, the infinite is not an absolute, it is a relative; it is the place of a term in a system of relations. Whoever believes in the absolute ought to seek for it elsewhere than in the data of science, for he never will find anything there, in the last analysis, except differences between states of consciousness. We shall see later whether this conclusion stands the test in the case of the true infinite, which is that of quantity, the mathematical infinite. E.

The Vita Pseudo-Ammoniana. In all of the MSS. of the Commentaries of Ammonius and Philoponos to the Categories a brief Vita of Aristotle is prefixed, and this is followed by a slight treatise on Logic as the Organon of philosophy. In the editio princeps of the works of Aristotle the Vita appeared without the treatise on Logic under the title /3[os 'Aptfror4EXov3 Kara ?tXo'7rovov. In the following edition (Venetiis 1503, 1545, 1546), it was ascribed to Ammonius, and so acquired the name Pseudo-Ammoniana. This Vita is closely related to the Vita Marciana, and the question arises whether one is derived from the other or both are from a common source. From the evidence of language Pseudo-Ammoniana must be later than the Marciana; the former on linguistic grounds must be referred to the Byzantine age, while the latter belongs probably to the time of the last Neoplatonists. This fact taken with the evidence found in the manner of composition and the contents of the two Lives, indicate that the Vita Marciana is the source of the Pseudo- Ammoniana. The author of the Byzantine Commentary to the Isagoge of Porphyry (Flias, a pupil of Olympiodoros), is the probable author of the Vita Pseudo-A mmoniana and the accompanying treatise on Logic. II. The Vita Marciana. This is a collection of disjointed excerpts from some older Vita. The chief source as given in the Vita itself is Andronikos and Ptolemaios, and these two are quoted by Elias in his Conmentary to the Categories as authorities (Brandis, p. 22 a 12, 24a 20). The work of Ptolemaios, which con- tains an account of the life, an enumeration of the writings, and a copy of the will of Aristotle, furnishes the chief source of the Marciana, and was used by Elias, as is shown by parallel passages. In addition to Ptolemaios, the Vita is dependent on Simplicius and Olympiodoros (ef Simplic. de coelo, p. 4I1t and Vit. Marc., p. 433, 5; Olymp. in Plat. Gorg., p. 39i and Vit. Marc., p. 431, 20; Olymp. in Ar. Meteor., f. 32 and Vit. Marc., p. 432, I5.) W. H.</page></plain_text>
