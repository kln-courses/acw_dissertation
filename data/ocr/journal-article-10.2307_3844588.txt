Similarly, cultural materialism finds an uncannily apt exemplar in drama, especially the insistently vernacular, economically driven, politically drenched Renaissance theater. But what of prose? It seems to offer a glimpse into neither psychobiography nor cultural politics, at least not in the terms ofthe current criti? cal discussion. More to the point, it is a stylistic quagmire. Ac? cepting the fallacy of linear progression, we feel ourselves obliged to confess that, contra Henry Fielding or George Eliot, English prose fiction of the early modern period toddles along clumsily, filled with much potential but little achievement. Thomas Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller, or, The Life oflacke Wilton, stylistically cacophonous, cheerfully amoral, and boast? ing an encyclopedic range of miscreant behavior from pranks to tortures, is paradigmatic. As a cultural artifact it is surely in? triguing, but as literature it perplexes, alienates, and even repels many readers. In the four hundred years since The Vnfortvnate Travellefs publication, nothing resembling consensus has been reached on even the most basic assignation: genre. Some declare Wendy Hyman is assistant professor of Shakespeare and Renaissance Literature in the English Department at Ithaca College. She is expecting her Ph.D. from Harvard University in March 2005. Her dissertation is entitled "Skeptical Seductions: Carpe Diem, Materialism, and Doubt in English Re? naissance Literature."</page><page sequence="2">24 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller Nashe's 1594 work to lack not only a genre, but also a subject. "In a certain sense ofthe verb 'say,'" writes C. S. Lewis, "if asked what Nashe 'says,' we should have to reply, Nothing . . . In his exhilarating whirlwind of words we find not thought nor passion but simply images."2 And in a rare moment of critical exaspera- tion, Richard A. Lanham simply announces that in the face of The Vnfortvnate Traveller* s most violent imagery?for truly, not even Christopher Marlowe lingers so salaciously over violent de? tail?"[l]iterary analysis is helpless."3 An alternate view, prefer- able because it accepts Nashe on his own terms, instead defends the "distortions, shifts, ambiguities, and improprieties of The Unfortunate Traveller [as] . . . legitimate challenges to our critical and epistemological codes rather than severe flaws which some? how disqualify the work." But this defense comes at the cost of making Nashe a kind of protodeconstructionist out to contest "any system of meaning or any concept of 'reality'" and threaten the naive reader's "cherished notion of a transparent, intelligible world."4 What both the rhetorical and deconstructive approaches have in common, then, is their equation of incongruity with opac- ity, of polypfiony with discord. It is undeniable that Nashe's text, with its deluge of bizarre and discordant metaphors, orgiastic violence, and cacophony of voices and genres, makes such readings almost irresistible. No- where, with the possible exception of some of the most daring seventeenth-century metaphysical conceits, do we find this de? gree of strain between tenor and vehicle. For example, Nashe gives us such neologisms as eyes that "glared &amp; burnt blew like brim- stone and aqua vitee set on fire in an egshell"; compares a gentleman's cloak to "am Elephantes eare, that hanges on his shoulders like a countrie huswiues banskin"; and figures a vivi- sected human heart as "a plum [pulled] from the bottome of a porredge pot."5 The Vnfortvnate Traveller is also marked by ge- neric fecundity: one critic itemizes "humanist oration, Anglican sermon, jest-book anecdotes, urban journalism, satire, aristo? cratic lyric, [and] revenge tragedy," among others.6 In the face of these pyrotechnics, Lanham, for one, avers, "there exists no com- monly accepted critical procedure to deal with such an artifact."7 That Nashe transgresses every rhetorical, generic, and nar? rative convention he comes across is not, then, in dispute. But what has been largely overlooked is the extent to which these transgressions are a deliberate form of "travel" and transgres? sion in The Vnfortvnate Traveller and not merely deconstructive ends in themselves. As Lorna Hutson provocatively notes, "we</page><page sequence="3">Wendy Hyman 25 should start considering the way in which an apparent shape- lessness, a lack of continuity and coherence, might function as a politically and morally significant aesthetic in its own right."8 I propose that, analogous to the theatrical violation of sumptuary laws, Nashe's quashing of literary decorum is his passport into exotic literary, political, economic, and historic territory: the court of Henry VIII; the workshops of Agrippa, Erasmus, and Surrey; the banqueting houses of Italy; the universities of Germany. An ideological method bolsters the apparent madness. Nashe's mis? cegenation of styles, classes, and identities offers a subversive, and often violent, challenge to the social hierarchy, one that conflates king with page, pamphleteer with court poet, and cozenage with religious holy war. The Vnfortvnate Traveller pre? sents this challenge not only in its manifest narrative (that is, the trickster stealing beer or making off with a lord's identity), but at a minute level of rhetoric and language: for example, the indeco- rous use of the grand style for quotidian or base subjects, or the high-profile sparring between oral and literary modes. The unru- liness that first appears to be merely a matter of style, then, is also a form of intentional subversion. The Vnfortvnate Traveller plunders the past for genres, personas, and literary styles to ab- scond with and redefine. And each instance of flouted decorum displays Wilton's ingenious appropriation of entrenched forms of power. But for all its picaresque sedition, I will argue, The Vnfortvnate Traveller finally applies its confrontational tactics most incriminatingly against its readers and itself, scrutinizing the lit? erary imagination?just as it does political or religious or eco? nomic power?as something rapacious, transgressive, and unreliable. Through its cacophonous experiments with style and genre, and through its mock bibliographic forms, the text inter? rogates both its status as an artifact and the larger system of literary consumption and production in which it circulates. This article will consider Nashe's bibliographic self-consciousness at a number of key sites: the implicit provocation of the dedicatory apparatus; the equivocal positioning ofthe narrator during a pair of especially violent incidents; and the recurring contests between early modern prose fiction and the literary tradition. As I shall suggest, Nashe's experiments with narrative in all of these in? stances reveal a prescient degree of historical and literary aware? ness. Above all, they demonstrate Nashe's agon with courtly and traditional models of literary production and his ambivalent self- promotion as the progenitor ofa radical, new idea of authorship.9</page><page sequence="4">26 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller I. THE INGENIOUS INFANT OF THE LITERARY MARKETPLACE The subversive power ofthe written word, like the early jests of The Vnfortvnate Traveller, initially appears cheerfully cathar- tic. Like all rebels, the subversive text must spar with entrenched forms of political, economic (and in this case literary) power. Yet Nashe's Jack Wilton does so with sufficient zest to remind us not ofthe grasping courtier but the exuberant Autolycus: if you can single-handedly turn a tragic world into a comedic world, after all, you are well entitled to pick a few purses along the way. In? deed, the picaresque mode is a crucial part of The Vnfortvnate Travellefs ideological framework. Its vivacity, craftiness, and rogue authority provide a template for the more portentous socioeco? nomic coups of the text, particularly those touching its own ma? teriality and circulation. Just as Jack Wilton's jests play Robin Hood with other men's beer, Nashe democratizes his own literary artifact by slyly undercutting the contemporary system of aristo? cratic book production. The prefatory matter ofthe volume shows Nashe's literary experiments in confrontation with the traditional socioeconomic hierarchy, patronage, and authorship itself, ironi? cally confessing the text's implication in these systems all the while. The Vnfortvnate Traveller begins, as was of course standard in an age of literary patronage, with a dedication. But this dedi? cation to the earl of Southampton, for all its punctilious polite? ness at moments, veers dangerously close to insult at other times.10 Nashe must have been overly optimistic that Southampton would appreciate the joke (he apparently did not) and the dedica? tion quietly absents itself from the second edition.11 But a joke it certainly was. "Ingenuous, honorable Lord," Nashe begins, "I know not what blinde custome methodicall antiquity hath thrust vpon vs, to dedicate such books as we publish to one great man or other; In which respect, least anie man should challenge these my papers as goods vncustomd, and so extend vppon them as forfeite to contempt, to the seale of your excellent censure loe here I present them to bee seene and allowed" (p. 201). What does one make of this exercise, simultaneously earnest and parodic? Whatever ostensible pecuniary ends Nashe may have purposed, this dedication must also be read as a theatricalization of style: as the first among many ofthe contemporary genres that Nashe exuberantly parodies.12 On the one hand, Nashe seems genuinely to have wished for remuneration from Southampton. There is a kind of modesty topos implicit in his metaphor of the</page><page sequence="5">Wendy Hyman 27 text as "goods vncustomd" that must be approved by external authority. "Your Lordship is the large spreading branch of re- nown," he avows later in the dedication, "from whence these my idle leaues seeke to deriue their whole nourishing" (p. 202). And yet, on the other hand, he surely damns with faint praise by scoffing the genre of the dedication as a "blinde custome methodicall antiquity hath thrust vpon vs"?to say nothing ofthe dismissive wave to Southampton as "one great man or other." The gesture is expressly insubordinate, in fact defying "two kinds of authority?literary tradition and literary patronage" at once.13 A good part of the work of this dedication, that is, is the deft reversal of the economic relationship between author and pa? tron. For the writer returns from his travels with an "vncustomd" text as if it were forbidden exotica, making the earl of Southampton merely the functionary at the border, assessing the goods therein.14 Nashe's economic hijinks construe the wealthy patron, not the money-seeking writer, as the philistine. Some "great man or other" does not actually promote the arts; he merely appraises a com- modity.15 Nashe thereby stages the economic necessity of literary patronage not so much as a force he yields to, but as just more raw material to be devoured by his text (and, by the second, dedi- cation-free edition, spit out). The only thing that undercuts the patron's position more than the dedication to him is the quasi dedication that follows: "The Induction to the dapper Mounsier Pages ofthe Court," which of? fers a very different performance for a very different audience (p. 207). While multiple dedications are historically par for the course, the Induction shuns obsequious platitudes in favor of a rede- fined, even subversive authorial position. If the epistle to Southampton satirizes the formulaic high style of the dedicatory genre, the performative Induction goes beyond satire toward an experimental redefinition of the form: "Gallant Squires, haue amongst you: at Mumchaunce I meane not, for so I might chaunce come to short commons, but at nouus, noua, nouum, which is in English, newes ofthe maker. A proper fellow Page of yours, called lack Wiltonby me commends him vnto you, and hath bequeathed for wast paper here amongst you certaine pages of his misfor- tunes" (p. 207). What is most immediately noticeable is Nashe's pluralizing of the dedicatory form, requesting the audience not of a lord and potential patron, but a boisterous gallery of "fellow Page[s]." The radical populism of such a move should not be underestimated, for it signals nothing less than, in Jonathan V. Crewe's words,</page><page sequence="6">28 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller "the emergence of an entire pseudo-order of which the page is king . . . represent[ing] the full enfranchisement of an inferior order destined to servitude."16 Moreover, instead of proffering a courtly document, Nashe stages what seems to be a live perfor? mance, replete with Prospero-like pleas for attentiveness ("Gal- lant Squires, haue amongst you"; "euerie man of you take your places, and heare Iacke Wilton tell his owne Tale," p. 208). And rather than modestly recommend the document that follows for its learning or morality or even its entertainment value, Nashe tells us Wilton has suggested it might be used to "kindle Tobacco" or "stop mustard-pottes" (p. 207). The whole performance stag- gers out of the court and into the saloon. It also, quite momentously, staggers out of the past and into the future. The Southampton epistle derides the "blinde custome" of "methodicall antiquity." But the Induction offers something novus, nova, novurru the news, the new. The Induction subtly plays off against the dedication to Southampton in other ways as well. If the first dedication flagged the status of the text as an economic object and turned the pa? tron into an insensate bureaucrat, the Induction uses a different kind of sleight of hand. Rather than humbly presenting the text as something potentially worthwhile for his readers, Nashe con- scripts his readers to do something worthwhile for his text: "lost a little neerer to the matter &amp; the purpose. Memorandum, euerie one of you after the perusing of this pamphlet is to prouide him a case of ponyardes, that if you come in companie with anie man which shall dispraise it or speak against it, you may straight crie Sic respondeo, and giue him the stockado. It standes not with your honours (I assure ye) to haue a gentleman and a page abusde in his absence" (p. 207).17 By staging this production in the court of public opinion, the common auditor is at once equated with, and thereby displaces the primacy of, Southampton. In one of the most clever and sig? nificant doublings in The Vnfortvnate Traveller, then, the com- moners as well as the lords are given a very active role in whether Nashe will "be out-landish Chronicler more"; in a market economy, of course, that power is determinative (p. 328). This democratiz- ing move signals Nashe's keen awareness of literature as com? modity. The competing dedications make the same artifact feel as if it belonged at once to two very different editions: one pack- aged in deluxe vellum for the highbrow set, and one in a trade binding?or, more accurately, a throwaway pamphlet of the type Nashe had so frequently, and calamitously, penned. With an acute</page><page sequence="7">Wendy Hyman 29 degree of authorial self-consciousness, this pair of dedications registers a precocious turn away from the patronage system and toward the emerging public literary marketplace. What Nashe's dedicatory apparatus does by way of introduc? tion, his bibliographic puns do passim: they draw attention to the material object itself and reposition its relationship to the patronage system. For example, the suggestive set of associa- tions that accumulate around the equivalence of the "leaves" of Nashe's book with those of a tree thoroughly confuses the accus- tomed relationships among reader, author, and text in interest? ing ways. Nashe begins simply with an extended conceit in which his book, rather than receiving subsistence from its own author, feeds parasitically on the sap the patron provides. Just like the leaves of a tree, writes Nashe: This handfull of leaues I offer to your view, to the leaues on trees I compare, which as they cannot grow of themselues except they haue some branches or boughes to cleaue too, &amp; with whose iuice and sap they be euermore recreated &amp; nourisht; so except these vnpolisht leaues of mine haue some braunch of Nobilitie whereon to depend and cleaue, and with the vigorous nutriment of whose authorized commendation they may be continually fosterd and refresht, neuer wil they grow to the worlds good lik- ing, but forthwith fade and die on the first houre of their birth. Your I^ordship is the large spreading branch of re- nown, from whence these my idle leaues seeke to deriue their whole nourishing. (p. 202)18 Ostensibly, Nashe would have us believe that his book is help- less, passive, existing simply as a supplicant in relation to its lord. What else is a printed book in an aristocratic economy than a kind of low-class messenger, a court page literally bound to his service? But the usual ontology of power is also uprooted, as it were, by the same technical vocabulary. The leaf metaphor puts us on the lookout for the double valence and misappropriation of bibliographic terminology. To whom, then, is the "Induction to the dapper Mounsier Pages of the Court" really addressed? Cer? tainly, at least in part, his audience is the group of imagined "gallant squires," which I have suggested forms a counterpoint to the lordly audience of the first dedication. But the "pages," in another significant sense, are also being construed as the pages</page><page sequence="8">30 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller of his own text.19 The bibliographic self-consciousness is indeed novus: according to the OED, Nashe was the first to use "page" as a printed sheet.20 By employing this double meaning ofthe word pages, that is, Nashe's quasi-mock dedication is simultaneously a witty send up ofthe "go forth little book" genre: it is an address, an induction, to his own literary production. The personage of the Page doubles for the physical object of the page, as Nashe? through a message delivered by his double, Wilton?addresses both his own book and his common audience.21 The "crowning" challenge to the accustomed hierarchy of these relationships comes when Nashe refers to his own creation as "this Chronicle ofthe king of Pages" (p. 208). Appropriating royal terminology for his own person, the subsequent claim that King Henry VIII is "the onely true subiect of Chronicles" emerges as nothing more than a cleverly disguised, and patently disingenuous, palinode (p. 209). The king, indeed, is not a subject. Nashe has much ground to cover before he arrives there, but by the end of The Vnfortvnate Traveller the power structure has been so thoroughly redefined that the pretense of a noble audi? ence is dropped altogether: "if herein I haue pleased anie," Nashe writes, "it shall animat mee to more paines in this kind" (p. 328). An author needs not "one great man or other," as the "braunch of Nobilitie whereon to depend and cleaue." And this turning away from the patronage system is a gesture that, as I have hoped to suggest, exceeds the economies ofthe printed page. It begins the process that will be the obsession of The Vnfortvnate Traveller. redefining the power structures implicit in prose authorship. I have proposed earlier that Nashe was aware of the violent, even radical nature of this process. I would suggest that it is no acci? dent that each of Nashe's pages is, in the battlefield of public opinion, to "prouide him a case of ponyardes." This wit combat may well be bloody. II. THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD Many have observed that The Vnfortvnate Traveller has, for all its digressiveness, a kind of developmental structure. Begin? ning with the roguish pranks Wilton perpetuates to the fierce rape, vicious religious battle, and gruesome executions he wit? nesses, the text's violence builds toward a crescendo of cruelty. What has been less frequently observed is that as the narrator's concomitant descriptions of these events become increasingly lurid and grandly histrionic, the literary "chronicler" emerges not as</page><page sequence="9">Wendy Hyman 31 an eyewitness but as a manipulator, even as the villain, of the text. I will look in particular at the narration of the slaughter of the Anabaptists and of Heraclide's rape to trace the ways in which The Vnfortvnate Traveller illuminates parallel trajectories for vio? lence and for storytelling. The scrutiny to which Nashe subjects the literary imagination in these episodes belies the narrator's ludic affectation, and shows a text at war with itself. I would like to begin with a consideration of the massacre of the Anabaptists. The entire incident elicits a bewildering range of responses from the narrator, from moral smugness to amused wisecracks to horrified remorse. Here I quote from the climax of the battle: The Emperialls themselues that were their Executioners (like a father that weepes when he beates his childe, yet still weepes and stil beates) not without much ruth and sorrow prosecuted that lamentable massacre . . . their swordes, theyr pikes, their bills, their bowes, their caleeuers slew, empierced, knockt downe, shot through, and ouerthrew as manie men euerie minute of the battell as there fails eares of corne before the sythe at one blow . . . so ordinarie at euerie foot-step was the imbrument of yron in bloud, that one could hardly discern heads from bullets, or clottred haire from mangled flesh hung with goare. (pp. 240-1) A paragraph that begins with a homely and sentimental pic? ture of the reluctant father's punishment culminates in a horri- fying scenario of ubiquitous blood and viscera. The kinds of weapons and the varieties of death multiply in an orgy of vio? lence. Human lives are wiped out like "eares of corne before the sythe." Both the mercy ofthe father and ofthe "Emperialls" who perpetrate the slaughter are undermined, as is the gullibility of the reader. No lesson is learned from this massacre, least of all by the dead Anabaptists schooled by their weeping fathers. What, then, is this macabre lesson really about? The narrator's relation of his experience transcribing this event suggests an answer: This tale must at one time or other giue vp the ghost, and as good now as stay longer; I would gladly rid my handes of it cleanly, if I could tell how, for what with talking of coblers, tinkers, roape-makers, botchers, and durt-daub-</page><page sequence="10">32 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller ers, the mark is clean out ofmy Muses mouth, &amp; I am as it were more than duncified twixt diuinity and poetrie. What is there more as touching this tragedie that you would be resolued of? say quickly, for now is my pen on foote againe. How lohn Leyden dyed, is that it? He dyde like a dogge, he was hangd &amp; the halter paid for. (p. 241) This apologia, if that is what it is, begins with the wry com? ment that the story must quite literally expire,22 equating the climax of the slaughter and the climax of the narrative. It ap? pears for a moment that the end of Wilton's tale portends Wilton's own end, as he finds himself "duncified twixt diuinity and poetrie." Structurally, the progression is of great interest. The climax of the massacre provokes the narrative terminus, fantastically lit- eralizing the truism that a story feeds off its subject. This is fol? lowed by a curious expression of guilt on the part ofthe narrator, apparently sullied, like Lady Macbeth, by the acts of his own imagination: "I would gladly," he insists, "iid my handes of it cleanly." Finally, following the threat that the narrative will ex? pire, it is suddenly and abruptly revived in a tone as belligerent and even vicious ("he dyde like a dogge") as the one that preceded the apology. The life of the narrator, the massacre, and the text all become conflated in one analogy. Indeed, the only harvest of the felled Anabaptists is the narrative itself. This incident can be usefully compared with the rape of a matron named Heraclide, to whom Nashe gives the most eloquent and moving rhetorical performance in The Vnfortvnate Traveller (if we are collecting generic experiments, here is Nashe as con- summate tragedian). Her heart-rending pleas, predictably, do nothing to forestall the violence perpetrated against her: "So strugling and so resisting, her iewels did sweate, signifying there was poison coming towards her. On the hard boords he threw her, and vsed his knee as an yron ramme to beat ope the two leaud gate of her chastitie. Her husbands dead bodie he made a pillow to his abhomination. Coniecture the rest, my words sticke fast in the myre and are cleane tyred; would I had neuer vndertooke this tragicall tale. Whatsoeuer is borne, is borne to haue an end. Thus ends my tale: his whorish lust was glutted, his beastly desire satisfied" (p. 292).23 Many aspects of this incident deserve consideration, but I would like to emphasize how remarkably similar the culmination ofthe rape scene is to the slaughter ofthe Anabaptists?suggest-</page><page sequence="11">Wendy Hyman 33 ing the root likeness is to be found not only in the incidents, but also in the narration of them. Just as Wilton's narrative nearly "giuefs] vp the ghost" at the climax of the massacre, so too does the conjectured climax ofthe rapist Esdras coincide with Wilton's pronouncement that "Whatsoeuer is borne, is borne to haue an end. Thus ends my tale"?bawdy puns clearly intended. Wilton claims he would "gladly rid my handes" of the relation of the massacre; likewise, after the rape of Heraclide he repines, "would I had neuer vndertooke this tragicall tale." But moments after this ostensible repentance, Wilton's grotesque voyeurism revives in earnest, just as it did in the relating of the massacre. The dying Heraclide "knockt her head against her husbands bodie: wherwith he, not hauing been aired his ful foure and twentie howres, start as out of a dreame . . . Awaking, he rubbed his head too and fro, and . . . began to looke about him. Feeling some thing lie heauie on his breast he turned it off (p. 295). From the height of tragedy to the depths of farce, Wilton's wilted narrative has only "dyed" insofar as Esdras's has: after a brief flagging, he re? vives in fine spirits from his (narrative) climax. In its consuming trajectory, storytelling has two sinister correlates: violent death and violent rape. In other ways as well, the rape narrative repeatedly impli- cates Wilton, and therefore Nashe, in the violent act. One need simply chart the narrative progress ofthe sword/rapier, clearly a stand-in both for pen and for phallus, during the course of the rape scene.24 The weapon is first presented from Esdras's per? spective. During Heraclide's peroration for mercy, Esdras's gaze is fixed on his "unsheathed" weapon: These words might haue mooued a compound hart of yron and adamant, but in his hart they obtained no im- pression: for he sitting in his chaire of state against the doore all the while that she pleaded, leaning his ouer- hanging gloomie ey-browes on the pommell of his vnsheathed sword, he neuer lookt vp or gaue hir a word . . . Therewith he flew vpon her, and threatned her with his sword, but it was not that he meant to wound her with. (pp. 290-1)25 A sword next appears in Heraclide's hands. In contrast to the rape weapon, her own blade, used as a means of suicide, she willingly embraces: "Point, pierce, edge, enwiden, I patiently</page><page sequence="12">34 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller affoorde thee a sheath: spurre forth my soule to mount poste to heauen. Iesu, forgiue me, Iesu, receiue me" (p. 295). And finally, having appeared in the hands of rapist and victim, an "vnsheathed" weapon materializes in the possession of none other than narra? tor Jack Wilton: "Here beginnith my purgatorie. For [Heraclide's husband], good man . . . running from chamber to chamber to serch who in his house was likelie to doo it, at length found me lying on my bed, the doore lockt to me on the out-side, and my rapier vnsheathed in the window: wherewith he straight coniectured it was I" (p. 295). The reader has information Heraclide's husband does not: Jack Wilton did not, in any literal sense ofthe term, rape Heraclide; the rapier he has next to him is not, in any literal sense, the rape or murder weapon (for one thing, a rapier is a rather diminutive weapon compared with a sword). And yet the reader also has contracted the queasy feeling that Wilton's voyeurism implicates him in a kind of guilt as well. His own mention of "purgatorie" approaches the level of a confession which heretofore has been implied ("I would gladly rid my handes of it cleanly"). And as oth? ers have observed, one need not be a Freudian to be disturbed by the presentation of Wilton during the rape scene, nor his subse? quent droop from voyeurism into a kind of postcoital exhaustion, "lying on [his] bed . . . rapier vnsheathed in the window." This transubstantiation ofan unsheathed blade from beneath Esdras's autoerotic gaze, to the suicidal stabbing of Heraclide, to its final retirement on the windowsill, inscribes/revises the narrative of the weapon like a palimpsest. The rapier, and the culpability, ultimately rests with Jack Wilton (or rather Thomas Nashe), who "unmasks himself and discloses his complicity . . . as the author of the 'tragicall catastrophe' . . . which he and the reader alike have witnessed."26 Is the act of reading these stories one of implicit collaboration in, or victimization by, the narrative act? Critics are divided on this question. In both the relation of the slaughter of the Anabaptists and the rape of Heraclide, Jack Wilton stages him? self as the phenomenological, if not the actual, perpetrator. After the rape, Esdras apparently has ample stamina to plunder the house and then escape. The narrator, however, finds that his words "sticke fast in the myre and are cleane tyred" (p. 292), as if he were the one exhausted by the violation. For all the text's self- incrimination, however, we are never allowed to forget that the ultimate consumer of these narratives is the reader. Heraclide's rape has made it clear: voyeurism is not a neutral activity. In one</page><page sequence="13">Wendy Hyman 35 of many instances of "deliberate entanglement of the reader,"27 Wilton assigns the completion of his narrative to his readers, who are told to "[c]oniecture the rest": that is, finish what Wilton's narrative started. It is no wonder then, that the dedication's ir- reverent turn away from patronage is staged as an "induction" of and to a larger audience. Producer and consumer of the narra? tive exist in a relationship of entangled agency and culpability, which is only multiplied in the public marketplace.28 If we "[c]oniecture the rest" ofthe rape narrative, then precisely whose "whorish lust [is] glutted," whose "beastly desire satisfied"? Esdras's, the narrator's, or the reader's? III. "HAPPIE . . . ARE THEY WHOM GOD HATH DOUBLED HIS SPIRITE VPPON" It is significant to the narrative's class-consciousness that the dedicatee, the earl of Southampton, is only the first of three persons of that rank ("one great man or other") with whom The Vnfortvnate Travellerfaces off. The second is the curious "banisht English Earle" (p. 296) who gives advice against travel. He, too, seems to exist primarily to be flouted, as his wan didacticism is annulled by the whole of Nashe's scintillating travelogue (a strat? egy later adopted by eighteenth-century novelists: one thinks of the narrative envelope for Moll Flanders or The Sentimental Jour- ney, both indebted to Nashe in more ways than one). The third earl, whom I will turn to here, is the earl of Surrey. This is the same Surrey who was the lyric poet par excellence during the period in which Nashe's fiction is set?and hence a worthy com- petitor. Aptly, after a swelling encomium to what he calls the "double soule" of poets, Jack Wilton appropriates the earl of Surrey's identity, and later his poetry: O, it was a right noble Lord, liberalitie it selfe (if in this yron age there were any such creature as liberalitie left on the earth), a Prince in content because a Poet without peere. [H]appie, thrice happie, are they whom God hath doubled his spirite vppon, and giuen a double soule vnto to be Poets. My Heroicall Master exceeded in this supernaturall kinde of wit. (p. 242)</page><page sequence="14">36 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller A consensual identity swap is initially liberating to both par? ties. Surrey gets the license to travel and philander in obscurity; Wilton achieves privileges and credit that only his borrowed name and rank could bestow. Yet while Nashe clearly admires his pre? decessor, Surrey typifies the beneficiary of the very patronage system against which the text postures. At the level of manifest narrative, freedom is equated with class position, and what Nashe ultimately borrows from Surrey is not just literary forms but power. The swap quickly reaches a point of diminishing returns for the nobleman, whose accounts are run up and whose name is be- smirched. But for Nashe/Wilton, it is an act of socioeconomic and literary triumph, even if only temporary. Earlier Wilton had reversed the roles of king and page, and of patron and author. Similarly, the earl of Surrey?initially "a Prince in content be? cause a Poet without peere"?becomes "[m]y seruaunt, or my master, which you will" (p. 257). This redistribution of power raises questions not only about class, then, but also about the relationship of narrative to lyric, and of individual accomplishments to literary heritage. Which is the servant and which the master? The conceit is comedic but unmistakable: Wilton travels around the countryside with Surrey's borrowed identity, and Nashe, penning sonnets for the dead poet, performs a metaphorically parallel act. To reliteralize the meta? phor, The Vnfortvnate Traveller suggests that even the appar? ently domesticated habits of literary composition, such as borrowing sources or emulating styles, are acts of conquest and usurpation. Surrey's courtly lyrics are not so much done obei- sance to as they are, like Southampton's favor and the unnamed earl's advice, contained within and outdone by Nashe's voracious text. Specifically under contestation here is the status of the Petrarchan tradition vis-a-vis prose fiction, vetted through the (quite plausible) sonnets that Nashe/Wilton pens in Surrey's name.29 Many critics have noted the seemingly superfluous na? ture of Surrey's "love" for Geraldine. For example, Constance C. Relihan suggests, "the love of Geraldine and Surrey exists only as an abstraction and as the motivation for the description of Surrey's tournament."30 But the inauthenticity of Surrey's Petrarchan romancing is, of course, first observed by Wilton him? self: "he wold praise her beyond the moone and starres, and that so sweetly and rauishingly as I perswade my self he was more in loue with his own curious forming fancie than her face; and truth it is, many become passionate louers onely to winne praise to</page><page sequence="15">Wendy Hyman 37 theyr wits" (p. 262). The Petrarchan poet indulges his fancy of loving Geraldine in order to write poetry about her. But Nashe outdoes him one step by turning the complacent Petrarchan re? lationship into fodder for his own literary experiments?here, the satiric Sidnean prolixity of the tournament scene, and the star turn of the ghostwritten sonnets. Not only Geraldine, then, but also Surrey, exists as an abstraction to be consumed by Nashe's art. Narrative invention is not merely polyphonic. It is omnivo- rous, and, if we take Wilton's possession of Surrey's "double soule" seriously, potentially mortal. "Let me not speake anie more of his accomplishments," writes Wilton, "for feare I spend all my spirits in praising him, and leaue my selfe no vigor of wit or effects of a soule to goe forward with my historie" (p. 242). Wilton knows well how literary indulgence leaves his words "cleane tyred." Either Surrey flourishes at Wilton's expense, or Wilton must flourish at Surrey's (one thinks of Shakespeare, defensively killing off Mercutio). Literary creation, at its most fertile, seems necessarily to result in the obliteration ofthe poetic subject. In the possession of Surrey, manuscript lyric gives way to the polyphonic, digressive printed narrative. Southampton's "braunch of Nobilitie" is shaken off (p. 202). Heraclide and the Anabaptists are violated in order to be eulogized. And the Petrarchan conceit and its Neo-Platonizing tendencies give way to Nashe's amoral, brilliant, obsessively carnal prose. Put another way, we might say that if Geraldine exists to have sonnets written about her, Heraclide exists to be raped, the Anabaptists to be slaughtered, the banqueting house to be rendered in high style, and Surrey to have his "double soule" possessed. Or, more simply, each narra? tive event exists because of the triumphant literary exercise it creates. For the poor rhetoricians Wilton encounters at Wittenberg, contrarily, literary style is little more than the command perfor? mance of the automaton-like Cicero?the residuum of an oral culture, resurrected as a ghostly joke. But for Nashe, the phrases, genres, and images that cyclone through his text rather resemble the resurrected husband of Heraclide. Bewildered, infuriated, and irrepressible, the text lurches through its own mansion attempt- ing to locate the perpetrator, but only stumbles again and again upon itself. Nonetheless, it would be a misrepresentation, at the end of the day, to say that what The Vnfortvnate Traveller stages is an act of aggression by its narrator against its audience.31 If we are subjected to exacting descriptions of tortures, we are also drawn an Italian banqueting house in rhetoric so mellifluous that it ri-</page><page sequence="16">38 Nashe's The Vnfortvnate Traveller vals the Song of Songs. Encomiums jostle with satire, and the low style shares the stage with language redolent of courtly verse. It may not be that all narrative acts are violent then, but that early modern prose, in and of itself, is exhilaratingly amoral, ge- nerically fluid, and frequently extralegal (in that there were ample opportunities, if exploited with varying success by Nashe, for unregulated publication). Nashe at every turn exploits the sub? versive potential of English prose fiction while also making the pleasures and pratfalls of this rogue medium his obsessive sub? ject. As we have seen, The Vnfortvnate Traveller presents a kalei- doscopic tour de force of images, subjects, and rhetorical styles. At the same time, the text deprives its audience of any reliable narrator, genre, diction, location, or moral. And in the absence of any stable center, The Vnfortvnate Traveller instead provokes us to consider what the experience of literature is and might be? come, what ought be the true relationship ofthe reader to the "page." Rather than dictating an answer, The Vnfortvnate Traveller presents us with possibilities. Perhaps reading The Vnfortvnate Traveller?perhaps reading?is like cheap entertainment, like imbibing the intoxicating products of the cozening trickster. Or maybe reading prose fiction is like travel to a foreign land, a psy? chic rape, or a boring Puritan sermon; or perhaps like a conta- gion, a conversation, or a ritualized joust. It might be like receiving tedious advice from an exiled English earl, or like donning an? other identity; it can be a magical summoning of the past, or an invitation to a paradisiacal banquet. Perhaps it is the inscru? table, disruptive, contentious artifact that launches all of these adventures.32 As this catalog?Nashe's catalog?suggests, Renais? sance prose fiction demands methodological approaches that do not view it as a clumsy progenitor ofthe nineteenth-century novel. We do better to read and teach it as an organically experimental, even confrontational, form, necessarily in contestation with other genres and the vagaries of its own production.33 Nashe, at any rate, has a nascent sense of his place in the development of prose fiction, posturing against the past and offering us something ilnouus, noua, nouum" The Vnfortvnate Traveller thereby appro- priates and satirizes traditional systems of power by staging them as antiquated or feeble, and offers in its own text a radical depar? ture from the constructions of authorship and publication then in place. Fittingly, The Vnfortvnate Travellefs manifest narrative is one of promiscuous cozenage, jests, battles, identity swaps, and other disruptions ofthe economic, political, and moral hier? archy. But it is no wonder that Nashe turns his "ponyardes" most</page><page sequence="17">Wendy Hyman 39 insistently against the literary product itself. For the "superingenious" author (p. 245), the ungovernable possibilities of early prose narrative were almost limitless, irresistible to the unleashed force of Nashe's art. Such boundless possibility, how? ever exhilarating, was not without its price. The Vnfortvnate Trav? eller pays its custom tax straight up. It revels in the potentials of a new literary age and a new model of authorship. At the same time, it suggests that narrative imagination is insatiable, trans- gressive, and more than a little drunk on its own newfound power.

Elizabeth Fowler and Roland Greene, Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture 16 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), which carefully "avoid[s] the novel-ori- ented and thus fatally retrospective" approach to early modern prose fiction (p. 6) and reminds us that "[t]he innovations ofthe period were tremendous in poetry and drama, but it is in prose that writers forged religious reforms, radicalized natural and political philosophy, and practiced new ways of think? ing about language and the categories of knowledge itself (p. 9). 2 See C.

Nicholl speculates on the rivalry between the young Shakespeare and Nashe for the favor of Southampton, the supposed "fair youth" of Shakespeare's sonnets. 12 Some critics, such as David Kaula, 'The Low Style in Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveler," SEL 6, 1 (Winter 1966): 43-57, tend to see all ofthe literary genres exhibited in The Vnfortvnate Traveller as parodies, but I ques? tion this. Nashe is a fabulous mimic, but often seems quite in earnest: for example, resisting the twin temptations of banality and maudlin sentiment in the Surrey sonnets (not to mention the temptation of pornographic ex? cess, which accounts for Nashe's other notorious foray into verse, the "Valentine's Day" poem). Nashe, I believe, sometimes emulates literary genres for purposes other than parodying them; The Vnfortvnate Traveller is not simply a satire, if it is a satire at all. 13Mihoko Suzuki, "'Signiorie ouer the Pages': The Crisis of Authority in Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller " SP 81, 3 (Summer 1984): 348-71, 350. 14 In fact, there were substantial laws regulating the importation of for? eign books during this period. In 1534, a year before the slaughter of the Anabaptists that Nashe relates, the strictest of a series of acts against alien printers and foreign presses was passed. Among its stipulations was that absolutely no bound books could be imported into England. Nashe's think? ing of his book as "vncustomd" (p. 201) may therefore imply both its foreign? ness and its uncouthness. For the historical background, see H. S. Bennett, English Books and Readers, 1475 to 1557: Being a Study in the History ofthe Book Trade from Caxton to the Incorporation ofthe Stationers' Company (Cam? bridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1969), and A. W. Reed, Early Tudor Drama: Medwall, the Rastells, Hey wood, and the More Circle (London: Methuen, 1926). I am indebted to Ben Annis for these references (private correspondence, 28 November 2002). 15 Suzuki, p. 350. 16 Jonathan V. Crewe, Unredeemed Rhetoric: Thomas Nashe and the Scan? dal of Authorship (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1982), p. 72. A fascinating recent elaboration of the bibliographic, economic, and peripatetic role of Nashe's page can be found in Julian Yates, Error, Misuse, Failure: Object Lessons from the English Renaissance (Minneapolis and Lon? don: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2003), pp. 101-37. See also Suzuki, pp. 352-3. 17 Despite Wilton's absurd tone here, emphasizing the anthropomorphic viability of literature emerged as a serious anticensorship strategy?e.g., Milton's assertion that books "do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them," and equation of censorship with "a kind of homicide" (Areopagitica, in Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed. Merritt Y. Hughes [New York: Odyssey Press, 1957], pp. 717-49, 720). Nashe himself had at least "Three run-ins with censorship in six years" (Jones, p. 62), and his anthropomorphization of his work can well be seen in light of his biographical experience. One who attacks Nashe's pamphlet literally abuses "a gentleman and a page . . . in his absence" (Nashe, p. 207). 18 This tree finds its curious doppelganger in the description ofthe para- disiacal "trees" at the Roman banqueting house. There the intricate inven- tions mimic living beings (as Nashe's "leaves" do); their artificial mechanisms</page><page sequence="19">Wendy Hyman 41 are hidden in and literally supported by various trees. Again, art that dis- guises art is presented by Nashe as dangerous, magical: "But so closely were all those organizing implements obscured in the corpulent trunks of the trees, that euerie man there present renounst coniectures of art, and sayd it was done by inchantment" (p. 284). 19 For further discussion of this bibliographic punning, see Hutson, pp. 34ff. 20Crewe, p. 69. 21 Simons cleverly refers to Jack Wilton as a "fictive, or subjective, ap- pendix to the author's ego and a page upon which the author can express this created self (p. 22). 22 Cf. Latin exspiro: (1) to breathe out, to exhale, (2b) to give up the ghost, to die (Cassell's New Latin Dictionary [New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1959], p. 234). 23 Note that the "two leaud gate of her chastitie" (p. 292) is yet another bibliographic analogue; Heraclide's genitalia, and/or her legs, are an open book. 24 While the parity is only implied, elsewhere Wilton explicitly associates writing instrument and weapon: Aretine, "Chiefe Inquisiter to the colledge of curtizans," had a pen "sharp pointed lyke a poinyard; no leafe he wrote on but was lyke a burning glasse to set on fire all his readers. With more than musket shot did he charge his quill, where hee meant to inueigh" (p. 264); not to mention the "case of ponyardes" earlier recommended for the pages' defense of the text. 25 Parenthetically, Wilton puts Esdras in a metaphorical "chaire of state," another embedded jab at royalty and hierarchy. 26Crewe, p. 75. 27 Cynthia Sulfridge, "The Unfortunate Traveller. Nashe's Narrative in a 'Cleane Different Vaine,'" JNT 10, 1 (Winter 1980): 1-15, 2. 28 My thanks to Marie Rutkoski for our discussion on this point. 29 If here Nashe contests the lyric tradition, at other points he contests other literary predecessors, including prosodists, as well: condemning the poor orators at Wittenburg and leaving Erasmus and Thomas More to their "discontented studies" (p. 246). 30 Constance C. Relihan, Framing Elizabethan Fictions: Contemporary Approaches to Early Modern Narrative Prose (London and Kent OH: Kent State Univ. Press, 1996), p. 147. 31 Critics disagree on the point; for example, Sulfridge reads The Vnfortvnate Traveller as a confidence game played at the expense ofthe reader (pp. 6-8; 13-4). 32 See Jones for an excellent analysis of The Vnfortvnate Travellerin light of Bakhtinian polyphony and Kristevian intertextuality. She notes that Nashe "mak[es] a drama out of his narrative shifts" although he is "not entirely in control" (p. 77). Charles Larson, 'The Comedy of Violence in Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller," CahiersE 8 (October 1975): 15-29, also points to Mikhail Bakhtin and Francois Rabelais. 33 Nashe's urge to experiment was not, of course, contained even by this one most heterogeneous text. From the morbidiry of Pierce Penniless to the cheerfully pornographic "Valentine's Day," Nashe availed himself of a stag- gering range of styles, genres, and themes.</page></plain_text>
