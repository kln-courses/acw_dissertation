This controversy, prompted by government demands for research that earns it keep, resonates with and speaks to wider debates about the 'relevance' of academic work. Geographers have much to contribute to these debates, by showing how curiosity can be cultivated, and by illuminat- ing this appealing but elusive term. In September 2009, the Higher Education Fund- ing Council for England (HEFCE) announced plans to link research funding to social and eco- nomic impact. The Council's research director sta- ted that the new system, known as the Research Excellence Framework (REF), would 'recognize and reward excellent research and sharing new knowledge to the benefit of the economy and soci- ety, and will ensure effective allocation of public funds' (Curtis 2009). Earlier, the UK's social sci- ence and humanities research councils (the ESRC and AHRC) introduced requirements for funding applicants to complete 'impact plans', and grant holders to report on observed impacts. Impact plans 'describe the impact or potential impacts' of research 'outside of the academic research com- munity [including the] private sector, the public sector, third sector or the wider public in gen- eral'.1 The requirement to write impact plans gar- nered relatively little opposition or scrutiny, though those who did speak out - including the investigative journalist George Monbiot - expressed concerns about academic freedom, and complained about the growing influence of busi- ness leaders in assessing academic research. 'Why,' he asked, 'is the Medical Research Council run by an arms manufacturer? Why is the Natural Environment Research Council run by the head of a construction company?' (Monbiot 2009). These sorts of arguments resurfaced much more vocifer- ously in responses to HEFCE' s proposals, which were widely published and posted, and engaged with by the UK's academic trade union, the Uni- versity and College Union (UCU). The UCU issued press releases and circulated a petition against the proposals, which attracted support from thousands of academics including a number of Nobel laureates, many of whom also issued their own individual and collective statements (Sattary 2009). In this debate, one word has fre- quently surfaced: curiosity. The new champions of curiosity have tended to assert rather than explain their faith. A group of philosophers, one of many to speak out against HEFCE' s proposals, put out a statement declaring that 'It is a fundamental mistake to think that pol- iticians, business leaders or civil servants can devise tests that will spot which curiosity-driven research is likely to bear practical fruit' (Times Higher 2009). This echoed the words of Sally Hunt, General Secretary of the UCU, who asserted that 'curiosity-driven research has led to major scientific and cultural advances' (Hunt 2009). Though issued by academics who pride them- selves in the precision of their written and spoken words, and by union leaders who generally make very specific interventions, these statements remain vague about curiosity, and they add noth- ing to commonplace definitions of this term: 'a strong desire to know or learn something', as the Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 35 447-452 2010 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2010 The Author.

If we want to argue that academic research- ers should be free - which in the UK means pub- licly funded - to be guided by curiosity, we need to say more about what that should entail, and how curiosity may be cultivated and respected. The following sections address these themes broadly and also draw out the specific ways in which geographers - in all their forms - stand to contribute to these debates. Cultivating curiosity I will begin by making three suggestions for how universities can cultivate curiosity, and will then go on to examine in more detail what curiosity does and can encompass. First, we can explore Sally Hunt's proposal that universities should be refashioned as 'spaces in which the spirit of adventure thrives' (Hunt 2009). Geographers have a distinctive contribution to make by illuminating the ways in which environ- ments variously encourage and discourage curios- ity. Speaking not only of universities but a variety of workplaces - construction sites, hospitals, facto- ries, and so on - Richard Sennett finds the desire for 'curiosity and experiment' in a wide range of settings, but he also finds some workers are more fulfilled than others in this respect (Sennett 2008, 49). He draws inspiration from John Ruskin, the British Victorian cultural critic who 'sought to instil in craftsmen of all sorts the desire, indeed the demand, for a lost space of freedom'. This 'would be a free space in which people can experiment, a supportive space in which they could at least tem- porarily lose control'. Moreover, 'This is a condi- tion for which people will have to fight in modern society (Sennett 2008, 114). To understand, and to create and even defend environments in which people feel able to take risks and learn freely is axi- omatic. These environments include: classrooms, lecture theatres, laboratories and fieldwork settings in which much research and learning takes place. Virtual and metaphorical spaces matter as well: the geographies of e-learning in all its forms, and the disciplinary spaces that underpin and frame schol- arship. Importantly, these are spaces of teaching and learning as well as research. Albert Einstein once remarked that it is 'a miracle that curiosity survives formal education' (Ryan and Cooper 2007), and his words resonate, underlining the need to be vigilant in the manner suggested by Boundary Crossings Ruskin: making sure that spaces of learning encourage curiosity. The million dollar question remains - how? This has led to a series of pedagogical experiments and developments in active learning. Problem Based Learning (PBL), for example, involves students in defining and then solving problems, which 'are used to engage stu- dents' curiosity and initiate learning' (Pawson et al. 2006, 106; emphasis added). Students may not sim- ply benefit from efforts to cultivate curiosity; they may also help to interrogate and negotiate this ideal. Generally speaking, students respond posi- tively to techniques such as PBL, but they do not want too much of them. This is instructive because it qualifies Hunfs ideal, inviting a discriminating and critical approach to curiosity itself. A second way to support curiosity is to reject sim- plistic distinctions between curiosity-driven and practical research; the former as self-indulgent and the latter as utilitarian. Chris Hamnett once sug- gested that cultural geographers have been 'fiddling while Rome burns', while worthier representatives of the discipline attend to real world emergencies and opportunities (Hamnett 2003). This kind of rhet- oric has been brought to debates about impact and relevance. Reporting HEFCE's proposals in the Guardian newspaper, Polly Curtis wrote that useful research would be rewarded while 'pointless uni- versity studies [were] to be weeded ouf. She explained that the move 'follows criticisms of some academic work ranging from the gender politics of Tarzan and Jane to surf science and David Beckham studies' (Curtis 2009; see also Shepherd 2009). But these caricatures do not stand up to scrutiny. Taking a step back from the impact controversy, Sennett argued persuasively that curiosity can be embedded within practical activity. In craftwork, he finds 'the intimate, fluid join between problem solving and problem finding' (Sennett 2008, 33). In academic research, too, the curious and the practical can be natural bedfellows. Research motivated by curiosity can have practical spinoffs - something repeatedly pointed out by HEFCE's critics, and in wider debates about the usefulness of academic freedom (Nowotny 2008). A more fundamental synergy between these spheres is also recognisable: the fund- ing of doctoral studentships in which universities collaborate with industrial partners (Demeritt and Lees 2005), and the 'translational sciences' in which problems identified in medical and other forms of practice are isolated for focused and more abstract investigation.

(2005, 359) Simplistic distinctions between types of research- ers and research - pure/applied, pointless/useful, curiosity-driven/practical - are as counterproduc- tive in defences as in condemnations of curiosity. Less divisive and more nuanced language is needed. A third way to create an environment amenable to curiosity is to stop worrying about whether we appear to be led by the head or the heart. Anxieties about emotional dimensions of academic practice have been identified in geography as in other disciplines. Addressing the American Geographical Society in 1946, John K. Wright articulated and responded to anxiety among some geographers about the passions and emotions - rather than the reason - that seemed to motivate their research (Wright 1947, 4). Much more recently, Liz Bondi (2005) has observed that geographers remain anxious about admitting the human emotions and feelings that drive our research. These anxieties have not entirely crushed geographical curiosity, but Bondi (writing with Mick Smith, Joyce Davidson and Laura Cameron) argues that emotions and feelings such as curiosity have often been deliberately excluded from, or habitu- ally suppressed within, many geographical discourses, especially those which understand geography as an attempt to provide objective, narrowly scientific, and quantitative models of the world. (Smith et al. 2009, 3) It follows that, if we can disrupt 'the very under- standing of geography as an entirely rational (in the sense of being emotion-free) enterprise', we may be able to open up our imaginations, cultivat- ing rather than repressing curiosities (Smith et al. 2009, 6-7). When we begin to embrace feelings such as curiosity, we may also begin to understand and to interrogate them. Interrogating curiosity Geographers have a distinctive contribution to make not only in understanding how to cultivate curiosity, but also in explaining what curiosity is. When peo- ple try to make curiosity explicit, they tend to speak and write geographically. Curiosity is widely por- trayed as a desire to encounter the unknown, articu- lated with reference to various terrae incognitae. This 449 is expressed through travel writing and exploration narratives: from prosaic chronicles of actual journeys to freer, imaginative voyages of fiction and poetry (Brantlinger 1972). Writers variously express and interrogate their own curiosity. George Orwell dis- tinguished between forms of curiosity in Down and out in Paris and London. Explaining that his descrip- tions of people in a poor quarter of Paris were not motivated by 'mere curiosity7 - a fickle, superficial and potentially intrusive interest in others - he stressed the seriousness of his purpose (Orwell 1987 [1933], 9). Academic geographers have drawn simi- lar distinctions, distancing themselves from the undisciplined, childish and even bestial characteris- tics attributed to certain forms of curiosity. Referring implicitly to Curious George, the anthropomorphic monkey whose curiosity leads to all sorts of gentle misadventures in a series of children's books (from 1941 onwards), Wright distinguished between higher and lower forms of curiosity: Now, as to curiosity, it seems a little unfortunate that this word, used to designate a nosy, impertinent charac- teristic of monkeys, small children, and gossips, is also applied to the loftier and more impersonal impulse that drives the astronomer to search the depths of the uni- verse and the geographer to penetrate the mysteries of terrae incognitae. (1947, 4) These comments reference the 'focussed curiosity that Carl Sauer (1941, 353) endorsed and demon- strated in his own work, but left to others to inter- rogate explicitly. David Lowenthal argued that geographical curiosity is 'more narrowly focussed than mankind's; it is also more conscious, orderly, objective, consistent, universal, and theoretical' (1961, 242). These principles have been echoed by a newer generation of geographers (Jackson 1980) and by other academics, advocating focused and disciplined forms of curiosity (Groen et al. 1990). Academic geographers are not alone in writing geographically about curiosity. Helga Nowotny describes the inspiration for scientific research in spatial terms: 'curiosity aims to explore a space that may still be furnished for us' (2008, 3; emphasis added), while Rebecca Solnit articulates curiosity in more poetic terms as a form of seduction, the search for 'a psychic state achievable through geography7 (Solnit 2006, 6). Solnit suggests that we 'Leave the door open for the unknown' (2006, 4), but there is nothing straightforward about this. Losing oneself means more than just losing one's way, and this underlines the need not simply to unleash curiosity, Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 35 447-452 2010 ISSN 0020-2754 © 2010 The Author.

In a lively, illustrated and witty book entitled How to be an explorer of the world, Keri Smith suggests a series of exercises, experiments designed to reawaken and cultivate curiosity. One involves documenting 'parts of a building that most people ignore', while another consists of going round a room in the dark, then describing it by touch (Smith 2008, 64). In this book, Smith invites the reader to open, perhaps re-open, his or her eyes and mind, to notice things, as if for the first time, without worrying too much about how practical or useful this may seem. The enemies of curiosity, she reminds us, are not simply research funding councils and university managers, but things we have been more culpable in buying and sliding into: the professionalisation and compart- mentalisation of academic activities, the bureaucra- cies in which we teach and conduct research, but perhaps most of all the passing of time and our tendency to close our eyes to the world around us as we get older. Smith's is an inspiring book, but it also illustrates the distinctions proposed by Sauer, Lowenthal and others, between forms of curiosity. How to be an explorer contrasts with many of the sources cited by its author, which not only encourage curiosity, but also contextualise it in some more sustained if still often playful and radical ways. These include Gas- ton Bachelard's Poetics of space (1964) and Species of space and other pieces by Georges Perec (1997), both of which investigated and sought variously to enlarge and disrupt environmental experiences. Perec drew, in turn, upon a slightly earlier generation of French 'geographers' including the Lettrists and Situation- ists, the focused curiosity of which has been por- trayed as a form of exploration, discovery and, in David Pinder's terms, 'adventure' (Pinder 2005, 1, 127-60). Compared with Smith's open-ended cele- bration of curiosity, these writers, grounded in coherent intellectual and/or political projects, are more 'focused' in their curiosity. This articulation of focused curiosity unsettles the simple and idealistic assertions of this term - as a positive and pure thirst for knowledge - that pro- vided my point of departure. It recognises that curi- osity takes different forms and that some may be more credible for academic activities. This set of dis- tinctions - between the impish curiosity disowned by Wright, the academically respectable counterpart championed by Sauer, the ethically responsible form claimed by Orwell, and the politically engaged curi- osity advanced by Situationist and radical geogra- Boundary Crossings phers, to name but a few - have an instructive parallel. Each echoes and recasts moral distinctions between good and bad forms of curiosity, which were once drawn within Christian traditions and lit- eratures. The latter are articulated more directly within books such as Paradise Lost, in which Patrick Brantlinger (1972) finds an explicit engagement with curiosity, expressed largely through the desire to explore, see and know the world, in a context where the desire for knowledge was not assumed to be intrinsically or universally a good thing. To under- stand this morally discriminating approach to curi- osity, it helps to turn to Joseph Conrad's Heart of darkness, the fin-de-siècle, dystopian adventure story that begins with a sketchy and largely blank map. Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look like that) I would put my fin- ger on it and say, 'When I grow up, I will go there/ (Conrad 1899, 197) In this story, curiosity was the point of departure for an adventure that proved tragic, not only for the protagonist but also for the real people and places he encountered: the Africans drawn into colonialism's brutal sphere. One way of learning from this is to try to salvage a form of curiosity purged of its imperialist and masculinist tenden- cies, to write and critically acknowledge postcolo- nial adventure stories (Phillips 1997). To this end, for example, Solnit (2006) exchanges the masculin- ist heroism of the explorer for the vulnerable figure of the lost individual. Another response to Conrad is to acknowledge the ambivalence - the appeal but also the danger - of adventure, exploration and most generally curiosity. The fact that curiosity can lead to some very dark places - a message from Heart of darkness - does not necessarily mean that its wings should have been clipped. Curiosity, we must understand, will always have unintended and unpredictable consequences, and it will always be associated both with good and evil. There is no way around this, which is why curiosity is some- thing not simply to celebrate, but also to respect, to approach critically, and to take seriously.

Funding councils need to understand that most academics are both intellectu- ally curious and interested in making a difference in the world, and in this being thoughtfully recognised by employers, students and funders (Staeheli and Mitchell 2005). While funding councils allow appli- cants for research grants to opt out of writing impact plans, where they can justify that their work is pure rather than applied, this common sense should extend to HEFCE's proposed system of assessing research. Critics of HEFCE's proposals need to acknowledge that some kind of impact assessment may be a good thing. It would be more productive to contest and negotiate the meanings of impact. To this end, Avril Maddrell (2010, 151) proposes that geog- raphers should find ways of being more 'outward- facing', while Staeheli and Mitchell (2005) argue that this process must be negotiated and politicised. This commentary has looked beyond an immedi- ate and localised controversy to some broader debates about academic values. If academic activi- ties are to be driven by curiosity, and if universities are to be 'spaces of adventure', these terms and ideals should be approached explicitly and criti- cally. In this unfinished project, geography and geographers have important parts to play, since environments are potentially significant in the culti- vation of curiosity, and since this term is frequently expressed in spatial terms. Thinking and writing geographically, it is possible to draw distinctions between different forms of curiosity: between the 'focused' and the 'mere', the good and the bad, even the evil. These distinctions pave the way for nuanced approaches to curiosity, and speak to questions of inspiration and direction: our motiva- tion and our intellectual compass.
