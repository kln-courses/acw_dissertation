LEPPLA Insect Attractants, Behavior and Basic Biology Research Laboratory Federal Research, Science and Education Administration, USDA P.O. Box 14565, Gainesville, FL 32604 This intriguing topic, developed by combining the unifying concepts of sociobiology with particularly illustrative examples of mating behavior in arthropods, was presented originally as an exceptionally popular sym- posium. Sociobiology, an emerging and therefore somewhat controvcrsial field, provides a framework for exploring the genetic bases, ultimate causes, and evolutionary consequences of animal behavior. Sexual reproduction, the other component of our topic, is an extremely costly yet pervasive form of propagation-one that commits an apparently inordinate amount of time and physical energy to a seemingly overcomplicated activity. We observe differ- ential parental investment and almost automatically question its relation- ship to associated mating strategies and sexual selection. We ponder, for example, the adaptive significance of complex and prolonged courtship dis- plays that include the use of elaborate chemical and physical cues. How can the fitness of insects be maximized by devoting an entire developmental stage almost exclusively to this singular activity? We intended that this -ym- posium would stimulate these kinds of questions by proffering relevant ob- servations and preliminary interpretations. Our goal was to create an aware- ness and appreciation for the subtleties of insect reproduction amnong entomologists who might otherwise consider the subject esoteric. The conceptual framework for our discussion may be gleaned from E. 0. Wilson's prodigious monograph, Sociobiology, the New Synthesis, and the equally intriguing Sociobiology and Behavior by David Barash. Wilson loosely defines sociobiology as "the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior" and emphasizes animal societies, population structure, communication, and the physiology that underlies these social adaptations. Both he and Barash based their compendia on the work of R. D. Alexander, R. A. Fisher, W. D. Hamilton, M. J. Smith, R. L. Trivers, and G. C. Williams, among other pioneering zoologists, who analyzed animal behavior in evolu- tionary terms and thereby discovered unifying principles that apply to both social and solitary sexually reproducing organisms. The quintessence of sociobiology is examined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, which describes societies and individuals (survival machines) as mere vehicles of genetic evolution. For our purposes, however, the "Sociobiology of Sex" ap- plies to all animals that engage in any form of sexual reproduction. 'Adapted from a symposium, "Mating Behavior: Sociobiology of Sex," co-organ-zed by N. C. Leppla and J. E. Lloyd and presented at the Fifty-Second Annual Meeting of the Entomological Society of America-Southeastern Branch, held in Gainesville, FL, on 26 Jan- uary 1978.</page><page sequence="2">2 The Florida Entomologist 62 (1) March, 1979 Since comparative animal behavior is fundamental to sociobiology, we must understand the historical development and current state of this field before we can discern the ways in which the two are linked. Animal behavior has been studied from the time that man first experienced an interdependence with other animals. Indeed, the classical works of Aristotle, Pliny, Descartes, Darwin, Fabre, and their respective contemporaries abound with behav- ioral anecdotes. However, it was not until 1894 that Lloyd Morgan founded the so-called "science of animal behavior" by advocating quantitative ob- servation rather than anthropomorphism and teleology. In 1910, Oskar Heinroth established ethology as the study of species-specific, instinctive behavior patterns and the discipline subsequently proliferated in Europe primarily through the efforts of Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and their associates. Specificity is determined by the comparative method, and in- stinctive behavior includes that which is genetically programmed and environmentally mediated. Both aspects emphasize the adaptive significance of behavior and therefore necessitate an evolutionary approach. Now ethology generally is known as the study of animal behavior in nature. The stereotyped character of insect behavior is ideally suited to intensive ethological analysis and this has prompted such prominent zoologists as Karl von Frisch, T. C. Schneirla, Howard Evans, Charles Michner, G. P. Baerends, and Erik Nielsen to select insects as their experimental animals. iTheir dissections of complex behavioral sequences ultimately yielded "ethograms" composed of discrete elements. However, these kinds of subtle elements often are inaccessible, being integrated into complex hierarchies with built-in contingencies and alternatives. Others may operate by means of simple switches, with the triggering stimuli either present or absent. In any case, behavioral repertories must be described before we can understand the reproductive strategies of insect species. Our distinguished authors represent a new generation of ethological in- quiry. Robert Matthews is well-known for his detailed studies of social wasps and he just coauthored Insect Behavior, the first comprehensive text on this subject. His paper introduces the topic by describing ongoing studies of sexual behavior associated with aggregation in male Megarhyssa wasps. His approach demonstrates the importance of relating observed behavior to the subject's morphological capabilities. Glen Morris has concentrated his sci- entific efforts on the aggressive behavior of acoustic Orthoptera. His article, therefore, focuses on specific mating systems, relates them to paternal in- vestment, and culminates by enumerating the conditions under which ag- gression escalates. James Lloyd, internationally recognized for his research on the photic communication of fireflies, concludes the symposium by em- phasizing relationships between systematics and behavior. He uses fireflies and bed bugs to illustrate the use of a one gene analysis model, describes and speculates on several unusual mating systems, and incorporates Smith's concept of evolutionarily stable strategies. These papers are enhanced con- siderably by the incorporation of many previously unpublished ideas and much new information. We thank C. 0. Calkins (Insect Attractants Laboratory) and T. J.
