<plain_text><page sequence="1">"CREATION" MOTIFS IN ANCIENT HEBREW POETRY The OT scholar should be surprised when he finds that Ugaritologists ordinarily deny that anything like a creation story has been found at Ras Shamra.1 It may well be true that nothing like the various Egyptian cos- mogonies, the Babylonian enuma elis, or Hesiod's Theogony have turned up in Ugaritic literature, and it is a limitation of the definition of a creation story to this kind of thing which brings about the reservations of the Ugaritologists. However, there is a great deal about the struggle of the beneficent weather god, Hadd (mostly designated by his title, Baal), to (re-) establish a proper order of things which means assuring sovereignty for Baal and fertility for the earth. This is exactly the sort of thing which we have taken for granted to be creation myth since at least Hermann Gunkel's Urzeit und Endzeit . We deal with a picture of a divine struggle against chaotic forces repre- sented usually by the sea or the "waters," and we assume that this is a creation story of a kind. This sort of story, which we may call a Chaoskampf, is generally held to have three basic themes : ( 1 ) the fight against chaos often represented by or personified as a monster of the waters; (2) the conquest of this monstrous force by a god who is consequently acclaimed king; (3) the giving of a palace (temple) to the divine king. In fact, despite the doubts of so many students of the Ugaritic texts about the occurrence of creation ideas in them, these discoveries have actually confirmed most of us who are primarily concerned with the OT in the conviction that some such picture of creation was part of Canaan's legacy to Israel.2 Perhaps the 1 For discussion and references see Loren R. Fisher, "Creation at Ugarit and in the Old Testament," VT 15 (1965) 313-324, and "From Chaos to Cosmos," Encoun- ter 26 (1965) 183-197. Fisher suggests that we distinguish between theogony and cosmogony and that we can find the latter in Ugaritic texts. He would call this crea- tion because it is the typical thing we call Chaoskampf here, a struggle of a young god, Baal, against hostile waters (Yam, the sea god) leading to his acclamation as divine king. This calls for more discussion than can be given here. It must suffice to notice that the struggle is between adversaries for control of an apparently orga- nized world, and that there is no hint that the winner constructs a new order as Marduk does in enuma elis : this hardly conforms to what are usually considered creation or even cosmogonie ideas in the ancient Near East. 2 For a recent study in this sense see Lucien Legrand, "La creation, triomphe cosmique de Yahvé," NRT 83 (1961), 449-470 (TD 11 [1963] 154-158), who feels that the creation theme was so inviting and dangerous because of its Canaanite origin that it was allowed into the canonical writings only in late times. We shall see that this reservation is hardly correct The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, Vol. 29 (393)</page><page sequence="2">88 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 problem the Ugaritologists find in identifying this sort of thing as creation is a good omen. It should give us pause. Are we so sure that the Chaoskampf with all its attendant themes is really a story of creation in any meaningful sense ? Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions of our texts. In fact, when it comes to creation we seem fated to do this in one way or another. The Christian is familiar with the firm teaching of the Church that God made everything without using any pre-existent materials. We tend to forget that the explicit and official formulation of this teaching has been governed by the actual situations which the Church has had to face. It has addressed itself to specific problems, particularly the recurrent challenge of gnostic dualism and the need to distinguish the trinitarian processions from the process of creation.3 Hence the rightful insistence on creatio ex nihilo which denies both the existence of some sort of matter independent of God and the formation of the world as something which emanated (in the Plotinian sense) from God. However, apart from John,4 dualism is not a biblical problem, and nowhere in the Bible are the special questions of developed trinitarian theology a concern. Addressing the scriptures directly (their implications are something else, but they are not the imme- diate concern of the exegete in this matter) for answers to questions not their own turns out to be fruitless, and yet we have asked our texts about creatio ex nihilo as though this was the concern of them and their authors. Still, without going so far as the technical meaning expressed in terms drawn from philosophy, for us the word creation in its normal context must mean some sort of absolute beginning of our world, or we equivocate. Can we really say that this is what the Chaoskampf and all it implies is usually concerned with ? In other words, when we speak of these things as creation motifs, are we in danger of introducing foreign elements, our own common sense notions even if not technical ones, into the understanding of the texts just as we do when we seek philosophy in them? It seems to me that in fact we are. In the OT the so-called creation motifs are intro- 3 The classic official Catholic text is the decree of the 4th Lateran Council (1215 A.D.) condemning the dualism of the Cathari ( D S 800) ; on the Fathers and the problem of procession and creation see H.

(394)</page><page sequence="3">1967] Ancient Hebrew Poetry 89 duced in function of something else, and we must wonder whether we are safe in speaking of creation here at all.5 The questions which bring out the motifs in the OT are various. There is the question of where salvation lies. There is question of an orderly world of men (and secondarily of nature).6 There is question of identifying the true god (Deutero-Isaiah; 2 Mc 7,28). There is question of the proper cult (P). But where is the question of absolute origins as such? Obviously, all of this is matter for many papers ; we can deal only with restricted aspects here. We shall take only the first point : salvation and so- called creation imagery. This probably seems to be a commonplace. It is such, and one can find reference to it anywhere.7 However, it is often rewarding to review the commonplace from the proper viewpoint. We may begin by noting the most influential study of the relation between the origin of things and salvation : Gerhard von Raďs brilliant analysis of the form of the Hexateuch and his conclusion that the primeval history is the genial addition of J as a kind of cosmic prologue for salvation history.8 It is not without interest, then, that von Rad, following Hartmut Gese, now admits that the primeval history must have been part of Israel's basic account of itself even before J. This conclusion is based on the fact that the literary form of this account called for such a prologue.9 Of course, if the primeval history was a given part of the genre rather than an addition to the basic historical credo by J as von Rad argued, it is harder to show that it is a brilliant stroke relating creation and grace as never before. Still, it can be shown that the genre has been adapted to a new purpose. Borrowed from 5 As implied in the first note, I believe that the Ugaritic materials show that the so-called creation motifs borrowed from Canaan are also in this class. Not only do they not speak of creation by progressive emanation from some primordial thing (Fisher's theogony), but they do not really tell of a struggle against chaos and the formation of an ordered world consequent on victory over that enemy. At most they speak of a struggle for control of the world and its organization. This, how- ever, is matter for another article hopefully to appear soon. 6 This is characteristic of much in the Psalter, where the laments imply that sin creates disorder and the royal psalms (note especially Ps 72,1-7) see the king's jus- tice (right order) as being in the same line as and even the cause of right order in nature. 7 For example and more or less at random : T. Boman, "The Biblical Doctrine of Creation," CQR 165 (1964) 140-151; A. Jepsen, "The Scientific Study of the Old Testament," Essays in Old Testament Hermeneutics (edd. Cl. Westermann and J. L.

In the Yahwist parts of the primeval history, the only ones which interest us, there is no real concern for the origin of the world. All the interest is directed toward its good ordering. This is not creatio ex nihilo of course, but equally it has nothing to do with the Chaoskampf theme either. The order depends upon watering (rain) and man (cultivation) : "When Yah weh God made heaven and earth no plant had yet sprung up in the fields because neither Yahweh God had brought rain to the earth nor had man worked the ground" (Gn 2,4b-5). The familiar motif of the waters is there, but in unfamiliar guise. They are no force to be fought or contained. They are simply God's instrument, his contribution to an orderly world. Even in the flood story the waters are no raging monster ; they are released to do their task quietly enough.11 In all the talk of the struggle against a watery chaos which is supposed to have been of the essence of the Chaoskampf type of creation story, as far as is known to me there is no attention paid to the fact that in the only instances when the waters do get out of hand (and remember that they are supposed to threaten this yearly!)12 they do so not as a force opposed to the divine but rather as the passive instrument of divine punishment. In the OT version, in fact, they are used to overcome disorder, moral disorder it is true, but for the OT moral and natural order or disorder are a continuity,18 and in any case we shall see that Chaoskampf motifs are commonly linked to 10 See H. Gese, "Geschichtliches Denken im alten Orient und im Alten Testa- ment," ZTK 55 (1958) 127-147: the literary form called for a "Golden Age" at the beginning of things but J has made it a time of sin; this is developed in detail else- where by me, cf. "The Word of God and 'Literary Embellishment/" RRel 24 (1965) 771-784. 11 It is not surprising that the waters are not represented as a personal monster in Gn, but the same thing is true of the Babylonian deluge story where, if the Chaoskampf idea were as ubiquitous as is often claimed, we should expect something different. This is another of the bits of evidence calling for a review of our ideas of ancient cosmogonies and cosmologies in general. 12 This, of course, is the basic idea behind the Chaoskampf concept : the representa- tion of the annual vegetation cycle in the guise of a divine battle against the ruin which threatens when the vegetation dies : see T. H. Gaster, Thespis (Anchor Books ; Garden City, N.Y., 21961) for a study of the ancient Near Eastern Material from this point of view; more general: Mircea Eliade, Cosmos and History : The Myth of the Eternal Retitrn (Harper Torchbooks; New York, 1959). 18 See above, note 6. (396)</page><page sequence="5">1967] Ancient Hebrew Poetry 91 moral or social order in the OT. The flood at least is there to purify, not pollute. The conclusion must be that the center of attention is the order of things, not their origins, in this use of the theme of the raging waters. In J, then, rather than speak of creation or cosmogony as the background for the OT drama of sin and grace one should speak of the order of things, cosmology in the root sense, if one will. Thus the familiar struggle element is entirely absent from J. At most it gives us very early evidence (older than the document itself!) for an inter- est in the beginnings of the order of things, particularly the moral order. There is no mark of the mythic Chaoskampf, but then this section of Genesis has never been part of the argument for the occurrence and im- portance of the Chaoskampf theme in the OT. It is rather the poetry of the Hebrew Bible which has shown the creation struggle imagery. In view of this, it is remarkable that the poetry which is identifiably oldest does not seem to have been studied systematically from this point of view. Yet much is gained if we can characterize the attitude to these most ancient texts. It may be that the forms found in later poetry, the kingship of Yahweh psalms for instance, are older as forms, for they surely antedate Israel itself. However, as we have them they are hymns modified by later use. They do not bear the linguistic marks of antiquity which other poems do, for example. If these latter tell us something about the use of the Chaoskampt theme in early days in Israel, about the meaning of the imagery borrowed from it and the purposes to which it was put, this direct evidence will show more clearly the meaning of the theme in Israel in the vital forma- tive stages of Israelite religion than any extrapolation from later texts, even though this latter is integrated into a view of the theme as it was supposed to have existed outside Israel in earliest times. The ancient poetry in question can be found in Gn 49; Ex 15,2-18; Dt 32,1-43; Dt 33; Jgs 5; 2 Sm 22,2-51; and Psalms 29 and 68, materials which bring us back close to Israel's beginnings. Rather than take the older and relevant parts of these texts one by one in exegesis we shall address three basic questions to them. (1) What does God do in them which can be related to creation ? This will come down to a discussion of certain basic vocabulary, the verbs used. Are they in fact ones also used of creation? (2) How does God act? Is the imagery used that associated with creation? (3) Why does he do it? This is crucial, for the purpose of an action will often reveal whether it is creation or not, and in what sense. When we turn to the first question : what does God do, we find at once that certain of the predicates attributed to him in these old texts are asso- ciated with creation or at least production both in the Bible and at Ras (397)</page><page sequence="6">92 The CatholiÄ Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 Shamra. Among these are qnh (Ugaritic qny) and to».14 In the ancient victory hymn in Ex 15,2-18, verse 16b reads ' am-zû qanítã, "the people which thou hast gotten." In another old text, Dt 32,6b, we have : halô'-hû 9 9 ãbíkã qânekã, "Is he not thy father (who) got thee?"15 It is well to retain here the double meaning in the rather old fashioned use of "get," for, though the root seems to mean "form" in a general sense, "acquire," or "be master of,"10 the myths of Ugarit certainly demonstrate that it has the sense of "produce" and "procreate."17 This Ugaritic evidence points up the sexual overtones of the root qny /qnh as opposed to some more general note like produce or the like. The other root, kwn, on the other hand, does not have this sort of over- tone: the basic meaning is to "make firm," and so, among other things, "form," and "found."18 This is clearly the case in Dt 32,6, where it is part of a passage describing Yahweh's founding of Israel as a special instance of his universal activity of "setting the boundaries of the peoples, assigning them to the various sons of God."19 Yahweh has formed a social order with each people given a proper place and guide. These verbs do not exhaust the vocabulary pertinent to our investigation. On the contrary, though the ancient Israelite poems avoid a favorite word of the Ugaritic texts relating to origins, bny (Hebrew bnh ), which is so 14 On these roots in Ugaritic and "creation" see M. H. Pope, El in the Ugaritic Texts ( VTS 2ģt Leiden, 1955) 50-54, though it is hard to follow him in emphasizing the sexual aspects of the roots, qny certainly has this aspect, but not always; see I Aqhat 220: d y qny ddm, "who possesses/owns (i.e., is master of) fields." kwn is certainly neutral, though it may have a sexual sense in context. Its basic meaning is established by the new text in PRU II, 188 (RS 15.128), lines 6 and 9, where it is a question of establishing guarantees. 15 For the antiquity of the poem in Dt 32 see O.

At Ras Shamra this was a cosmogonie or better théogonie word. For instance, goddesses bear a divinized Dawn and Dusk to El.20 In Dt 32, 18 Yahweh himself is "the Rock (who) bore thee . . . , the God who was in travail with thee." The imagery is strong : "bore thee" ( yelãdkã ) is parallel to mehollekā, "writhe in the pangs of childbirth" literally, surely at first sight as extreme an anthropomorphism as one could imagine. But, of course, it is precisely a freedom from the basic anthropomorphic view of the divine current in the ancient Near East which permits this. A pantheon preserves the distinct sexual functions with its gods and goddesses. The one God of Israel is beyond anything like this, so far beyond that the poet can freely use the image of childbirth to emphasize the affective aspect, the love of Yahweh for his people, a love which like a mother's is unearned and even more intense for the weakling among her children, since the poet uses this image to introduce the section on the faithlessness of Israel which deserves and gets parental punishment.21 This makes the usage here all the more poignant, for verse 18 resumes verse 6 with a new note. In the earlier verse we have to do with a section concerning the special marking out of Israel for Yahweh's favor among the nations, but the verbs used, qnh and kwn, though significant, are not especially colorful. The repetition of the title Rock (32,4) as well as the parallel in ideas between 32,6 and 32,18 form a kind of inclusion which brings us back to the earlier, happier situation, but by the change in tone also points forward to the judgment scene which continues the poem in verses 19ff . Hence the highly emotional figures ; the measure of Yahweh's love and favor is the measure of Israel's guilt and punishment. This is the mood of Hos 11, but in archaic form. The conclusion at this point is clear. Yahweh is indeed spoken of in terms which, in one way or another, refer to the coming to be of things, and this vocabulary is the same as that of the Ugaritic texts when they speak of origins. However, the OT gives the words a particular focus. It uses the 20 C. H. Gordon, Ugaritic Textbook (Analecta orientalia 38; Rome, 1965) Text 52, called by Gaster, Thespis, 418-435, "Poem of the Gracious Gods." Gaster points out, probably rightly, that there is a burlesque element in it as we have it. This, though, implies something serious to be burlesqued. Insofar as this deals with nat- ural phenomena we might speak of a cosmogony; insofar as they are personified and deified, a theogony. This ambiguity seems inevitable in the ancient stories of origins. 21 V. 18 is evidently old: witness the ancient title, Rock, and El (not Elohim), the lack of connectives and of the article. We may assume that the less colorful parallel, v. 6, which also lacks some connectives, is also ancient.

Even at Ugarit these expressions were mostly used for the origins of man and the gods (though the latter may well be personified natural phenomena), of a kind of social order or at least of social beings rather than of a cosmos. Still there is nothing there about the formation of a goďs people, nor of his loving and judging them. Israel seems to have done something quite new in applying these "creation" words to the description of its position as a saved and chosen people among peoples all under Goďs guidance.22 What is "created" is a social or political order. In Ex 15 Israel is constituted a nation at Egypt's expense. In Dt 32 all nations have their place and their guides assigned them ; a whole social order is brought into being.28 We can and do call this sort of thing creative, but it is scarcely creation in any tech- nical sense since it does not touch at all upon absolute beginnings of a whole world. We find thus far that what Yahweh is described as doing when "creation" verbs are predicated of him is something quite different from what the divinity does in the supposed Chaoskampf creation myth. It is somewhat different when we turn to the how of things. The poetry makes ready use of the motifs associated with the Chaoskampf . This is obvious in Ex 15. We have a battle in which the raging waters do indeed figure, the victorious god gains a temple, and he is acclaimed king. This is the very stuff of the creation myth in its classic formulation in enuma elis . But here it is demythologized.24 The waters are not the enemy but the weapon of God, and his temple is his own work. He is not subject to approval from on high, nor does he need a motion from the floor in a divine assembly.25 This use of terms related to the Chaoskampf is not confined to this passage. The psalm in 2 Sm 22 turns the imagery to a different purpose : 22 Perhaps we should add to the "creation" words the very name Yahweh if, as has been persuasively argued, it is a causative of the verb "to be" and so means "he makes to be." See F. M. Cross, HTR 55 (1962) 252-254. Note 123 is important for showing through parallel forms that the idea was not too "abstract" and "meta- physical" for the ancients. 28 This is not a common OT idea, but it does occur in another form in Am 9,7. Does Amos' insight into Yahweh' s universal love and providence depend somehow on the view couched in more mythic terms in Dt? The idea is very old, as it occurs in the 14th century Egyptian hymn to Aton (see ANET 370b) where, as here, it is entirely disassociated from any Chaoskampf motifs. 24 See on this Cross and Freedman, J NES 14 (1955) 239-240. 25 As did Baal at Ugarit: Text 51, IV-V ( ANET 133), and Marduk at Babylon: enuma elis, VI, 49ff.

The imagery of the mighty sea is the same, but its function is different. Now it is not Yahweh's weapon as in Exodus but the symbol of the adversary he so easily puts down. Early in its history Israel is so free from seeing any reality in the Chaoskampf theme that it has become a mere source for figures of speech. Its language can be used now one way, now another as seems useful in a given literary situation, something hardly possible if it were felt to be a description of reality, for then the use of the language would have to be controlled by the reality behind it. The only consistency is the end to which the imagery is directed. Always it tells how Yahweh saved by producing or restoring order, whether it is by means of the waters or by saving from the waters which symbolize evil. The "crea- tion" motifs have become images of salvation, and, of course, this became a tradition in Israel. In the psalms of lamentation, for example, the waters are a cliché for evil, and we shall find them appearing again as a weapon in God's hands. The point is that this turn was given to the imagery very early. Indeed, from its very first recorded use in Israel this is so. One further instance of the imagery of the waters is worth noting. This motif from the Chaoskampf theme appears in Gn 49,25 (= Dt 33,13) : birkôt Fhôm rõbeset tãhat, "blessings from Deep lying in wait below."26 The note of threat, even of recalcitrance, echoes faintly in that "lying in wait," a hint of an evil will in the waters, a hint all the more striking because it seems unconscious. It is just there. It serves no figurative purpose, it has no reason to be there except it be some traditional phrase or the like. The most one might say is that it emphasizes Yahweh' s control even over dif- ficult things, but this will hardly do in a context where there is no hint of any difficulties or opposition. This is as close as one comes to "rebellious waters" in the earliest poems, and it seems to be a case where the phrase is so trite it has lost any figurative meaning and its participle has become so colorless as to be equivalent of "being" or the like, even with the mild poetic figure of a personified Deep. Once more no battle, once more the waters are Yahweh's instrument, not enemy, and they are as mild as the brooklets they refer to, the blessings of springs in a dry country. So here too, in the realm of nature, the emphasis is on order for the benefit of Goďs people. 26 On the date of this text see H.-J. Zobel, Stamesspruch und Geschichte (BZ AW 95 ś, Berlin, 1965) 59-61, and F. M. Cross, Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry (Balti- more, 1950) 226-227. The translation in the text here of course takes t6hom to be personified as is indicated by the primitive ideas in the phrase. On this see F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, "The Blessing of Moses," JBL 67 (1948) 206, note 44. This, of course, refers to the entirely parallel text of Dt 33,13. (401)</page><page sequence="10">96 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 This same emphasis on order in society comes out in the motif of Yahweh the Warrior (Ex 15,3) inseparable from much in the ancient poems. Now, obviously the idea of the Chaoskampf implies (a) warrior god(s), but nonetheless the divine warrior idea had its own independent and important place in Israel's traditions. In many ways it was the holy war led by Yahweh, God of armies, which made the people of Israel.27 It would seem that this was combined with the other theme. The warrior god (' îs milhãmâ) is described in images borrowed from the Chaoskampf theme, as is clear in Ex 15, but especially in 2 Sm 22 where the God who pushes back the waters and bares the foundations of the earth (10-16) is the one who trains the king to fight (33-37). The same relationship appears in Jgs 5,20-21, where the very elements, the stars and the rain, are the weapons of Yahweh in the holy war against Sisera. This is not precisely the imagery of the Chaoskampf, as in the case of Ex 15, but rather of the Lord of nature and man making use of the re- sources of his domain on behalf of his people. This again brings us to a new theme. This is the god of the storm. Very early the description of the storm goďs power was applied to Yahweh. Already in Ps 68,5 Yahweh is the cloud-rider, an epithet of Baal at Ugarit, and in 2 Sm 22,1 lb-15 he moves on the wind with thunder and lightning.28 However, the locus classicus here is Ps 29. Yahweh shows his dominance through the storm. The emphasis is on the awesome power displayed in the thunder, the lightning, the blasts of the wind capable of smashing the mightiest giants of the forest. Awesomeness calls forth awe, and this terrible God receives it from the "sons of God" (29,1) as well as from men, and he receives it in his palace. Thus the result of the storm god's appearance at oncę ties into the complex of motifs associated with the Chaoskampf. The conqueror god receives homage and temple, but once again as in Ex 15 the means are different. There the means was not any conquest of chaos but the formation of a people through the defeat of Egypt, but at least the imagery describing this defeat was borrowed in part from the traditions of the Chaoskampf. Here in Ps 29 even the imagery is different. In a sense it is true that the picture is closer to the Chaoskampf in that the storm is real and 27 The basic work on this idea has been that of R. Smend, Jahwekrieg und Stamme- bund ( FRLANT 84; Göttingen, 1963), and Die Bundesformel (Theologische Studien 68; Zurich, 1963). 28 For the dates of 2 Sm 22 (Ps 18) and Ps 68 see H. J. Kraus, Psalmen {BK AT 15/1; Neukirchen, 21961) 136-151, 464-477, with extensive references to the litera- ture. The basic study of 2 Sm 22 remains F. M. Cross and D. N.

(402)</page><page sequence="11">1967] Ancient Hebrew Poetry 97 belongs to the realm of nature, not merely figurative and pertaining to so- ciety as in Ex IS. But this general connection proves nothing. The explicit topic of the psalm is the terrible power which the divinity shows in the storm. To be sure, the rainstorm could be beneficent. It was essential to the economy of Syro-Phoenicia, but this is not what the poet chooses to em- phasize. In the accepted analysis of the supposedly ubiquitous Chaoskampf theme this would be impossible. Such destruction wrought by water is not the manifestation and instrument of the divinity who will be king but of his monstrous opponent. Yet there it is; the storm god is acclaimed king, and this is in a hymn taken over almost without change from pre-Israelite sources.29 This might be significant in several ways. It attests an attribution of kingship to the god of the storm by acclamation of the divine council, something which as far as we know Ugaritic mythology allowed only to El.80 It shows that the waters, even in their destructive aspect, could be a divine instrument and bring a god to supremacy. If this is because of the concern with a rain economy as so often and persuasively argued by C. H. Gordon, it shows a concern with the order of things, an order maintained by violent divine power but not in any way which resembles the workings of the so-called creation myth. In any case, what matters is the maintenance of the world of Syro-Phoenicia, not its origins. Granted that this psalm is a direct borrowing from Canaan, we have here an antecedent to some of the things which we have found in the ancient Hebrew texts we have examined. There is the use of the waters, natural phenomena, as divine weapons in- stead of making them symbols of inimical chaotic forces. There is the con- nection of this altered or new motif with the divine kingship. Finally, to complete the survey of the means by which Yahweh is repre- sented as achieving his purposes in our texts, the answer to our second question about how Yahweh acts, we must look at a further set of images commonly used. Regularly he is associated with mountains. He is the "One of Sinai," the one who "goes forth from Seir" (Jgs 5,4-5; Dt 33,2). He comes with smoke and fire (2 Sm 22,9; Dt 32,22-25), and at his coming the earth is shaken to its foundations (Jgs 5,4-5 ; 2 Sm 22,8). This calls to mind at once the account of the events on Sinai, especially Ex 19, and the tradition associating Yahweh with mountains was constant (1 Kgs 19; Psalms of Zion; Na 1,5-6). What is pertinent here is that the manifesta- 29 On this see most recently M. Dahood S.J., Psalms I: 1-50 (The Anchor Bible; Garden City, N.Y., 1966) 175-180, with extensive references. 80 See W.

He destroys Israel's enemies (Jgs 5 ; 2 Sm 22) or he punishes his disloyal people (Dt 32,22-25). This is the same figure as that of the waters in Ex 15 or the storm in Ps 29. Probably Dt 32 and 2 Sm 22 are most important here since the fire of the mountain god merges with the raging storm, and everything seems to have cosmic meaning. The foundations of the earth are consumed, the breakers of death turned back. So many motifs are crowded together here: mountain god, storm god, warrior god, Chaoskampj' but they are all symbolic, impressive figures of speech and thought for picturing the way Yahweh controls events among men. The point is always political or social order.81 We have not yet turned explicitly to our third question about the why of Yahweh's activities as depicted in our texts. Since the answer is so bound up with what he does and how he does it, in fact we have dealt with much of the answer. It is double: one object of it all is that Yahweh be acknowledged supreme, acclaimed king, the other that order be established for his people. As for the first, we have seen Yahweh reigning in Ex 15 ; Ps 29; Ps 82 ; Dt 32,2-3 and possibly Dt 32, 43.82 The ancient Israelites saw no difficulty in picturing Yahweh as reigning in a divine council, since we must take a picture of him amid the sons of God in Dt 32 as somehow real if his special choice of Israel is to mean something. If it is a mere figure of speech, then the contrast between his taking Israel and the others' taking the other nations loses its force and election disappears. What appears to be unusual is the source of his reign. It is not the conquest of chaos in the 81 We might note that this mixture of motifs is not peculiar to Israel. Apart from the kingship in the divine council and the mountain god aspects they are all applied to Baal in Ugaritic literature. He is even associated with a mountain (Schmidt, Königtum Gottes , 23-27), but this is the seat of kingship, and he manifests none of the fiery attributes of the God who comes from the mountain in the OT. Even so, we should note this pre-Israelite mixture of motifs. Such mixing of literary phe- nomena is generally held to be part of the declining stage of a form, and this should call our attention to the fact that we should not assume pure forms at the start of OT literature. The Hebrews borrowed wholesale from an advanced culture, and this example shows what is evident anyway: much that they borrowed was far past the stage of pure forms. This is borne out by the mixed state we find in the forms of the oldest Israelite texts. 82 On the reconstruction of Dt 32,43 in this sense see G. E. Wright, Muilenburg Festschrift, 33. On Ps 82 see, besides the commentaries, G. E. Wright, The Old Testament against Its Environment ( SBT 2; London, 1950) 30-41.

However, in another image he is absolute ruler who orders society and its guardians as he will (Dt 32,7-9) or nature and its powers as he wishes (Gn 49,25). This is quiet superiority, but still total power. Once more the total expression cannot be simply subsumed under one head but the basic aim is clear amid the many images : Yah weh is absolute king of all. If anything the other object of Yahweh's activities in our texts is even clearer. With imagery borrowed from almost any source at hand including the Chaoskampf theme, they affirm that God controls events among men for the benefit of his chosen people. In itself this is no very startling conclusion. The longing for order in human and natural affairs is characteristic of the laments of the ancient world, including Israel, and the praise of it rings in the Psalter (e.g., Pss 8; 19). Here Ps 104 is informative. In part very old, it hais the spe- cial feature of uniting a Chaoskampf motif (putting down the rebellious waters: 5-9) with quiet praise of the order of nature (lQff.). However, the union is not quite smooth and organic. One feels the abrupt change from the mythic imagery to the Listenwissenschaft of the ancient Near Eastern wisdom tradition.83 Evidently it is not this wisdom tradition even united with hymns based on Chaoskampf motifs which is the original locus of Israel's articulated and (to it) self-evident concept of Yahweh as orderer. Neither did it grow out of a gradual "demythologizing" of a primitive Chaoskampf concept fully held in earliest Israel. Rather, the study of the ancient poems scattered in various books of the OT has shown them concerned with the events of Israel's historical rela- tionship with Yahweh and points in another direction. Israel was thoroughly at home in the imagery of the Chaoskampf from the earliest evidence for it in Israel. This ease with mythic imagery seems to come precisely be- cause it was seen as having nothing to do with a story of real, ultimate origins. The origins which counted for Israel were political and social, ultimately religious because these things were not separated, and these origins were seen to be the mighty work of Yahweh in choosing and saving Israel, protecting it, and punishing it if proper order called for it. Connected with this was the proper allotment of places to the other na- tions. All this could be and was described in the imagery of battles involv- ing nature, especially the waters, which could symbolize Yahweh's enemy or instrument involved in the real task, bringing about the desired order 88 See W.

Other imagery could be and was used; the divine warrior, the storm of God, the God of the mountain, the divine king who could and did extend his order to the "sons of God," the guides of nations, and thus all mankind. What we have here is not evidence for any real belief in a Chaoskampf with its attendant pantheon, forces on the same plane as God. Quite the contrary, as was mentioned earlier, the freedom in using Chaoskampf imagery in different, even contradictory, ways shows that there was little feeling of a reality behind it. Rather it was simply a con- venient source of tropes. This is borne out by the complex mixing of motifs which we have found. Warrior, mountain, and storm gods motifs are all used along with those from the Chaoskampf. This sort of mixing is usually seen as repre- senting the break-down of a form. Be that as it may, the fact confirms the point already made : there is little or no effort to use all these ideas and images as consistent, independent wholes. Rather they are merely sources for means to describe what is important, and this once again is the proper ordering of the world of men. Thus the evidence hardly indicates a need for demythologizing in the sense of a working away from a belief in the Chaoskampf and all its char- acteristic apparatus. The evidence is that such "demythologization" was there from the first because Israel was interested in historical, not cosmic origins, and so it could use the mythic themes without hazard. Once more, if we ask the proper questions, it would seem that we get answers. We should not ask about creation as such from these texts. It may be that there are relics in them left over from myths about absolute origins, though it seems to me that this idea forces the meaning even of the supposed myths. The problem arises because we assume the myths and assume their meaning, a meaning they sometimes had indeed ; but do we not extend this meaning to all the myths because there is always for us the question of absolute origins ? In fact, the ancient Israelite poems we have looked at do indeed contain material usually associated with the Chaoskampf. However, because the poems speak not of absolute origins but rather of the origins of the social order as Israel found it and understood it, these relics do not speak of world origins. They speak of God's saving Israel, and it may be misleading to seek more from them. Dennis J. McCarthy, S .J. St. Louis University St. Louis, Missouri (406)</page></plain_text>
