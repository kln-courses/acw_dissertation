Cambridge (Mass.), Harvard University Press; and London, H. Milford, 1936. Pp. x + 462. $5.00, 21s. THE latest volume of Peirce's papers deals mainly with Ontology, C-osmology and Religion. Here then is the heart of that " vast philosophical system of which he left only some fragmentary out- lines "-concerning which the remarks of Dewey, James, Royce and Prof. Cohen have raised our great expectations. By this volume that system is chiefly to be judged : it is, say the publishers, " the metaphysical culmination ", and after it comes the denouement- purely scientific papers, a memoir, and the letters. These last should be of very great interest: many are published in Chapters xxxii, lxxv and lxxvi of Prof. R. B. Perry's " Thought and Character of William James " and provide admirable comments upon the Thought and Character of both the co-founders of Pragmatism: some use will be made of these in what follows. Contents: Book i sets forth the doctrines of Tychism, Synechism and Agapism : that is to say, it attempts to explain the universe by the use of Pure Chance, Continuity, and psychological categories. Book ii consists of random, more personal, papers on God and social morality, the problem of evil, immortality and miracles. Scattered amongst these, however, are writings of a more analytical sort- his account of the psychology of purposeful conduct (468-477 1) and two versions (478-485, 485-491) of an account of Pragmatism. Many of these papers (Chapters 3, 7, 8, 10, 12 paras. 1-8, of Book i.; Chapters 4, 5, 7, of Book ii) are here published for the first time others are reprinted from such sources as The Monist, the Popular Science Monthly, the Hibbert, the Open Court, Baldwin's Dictionary, the Century Dictionary. Six of the most important chapters, how- ever, -have already become familiar in Chance, Love, and Logic, (Kegan Paul, 1920), in which they occurred as Part ii and Chapter 5, Part i. The papers vary very much in date and style: in general they might be described as written in a racy and aggressive manner- that is, in the manner vividly suggested by the photograph which occurs as a frontispiece. Three Categories.-The questions which here exercised the Philo- 1 Unless otherwise stated, numbers refer to.Paragraphs of Vol. vi.</page><page sequence="2">Collected Papers of C. S. Peirce, Vol. VI. 395 sophical Surveyor, he hoped to solve by observation. Peirce thought that his observations showed three sorts of elements in all phenomena; so that he has three categories which can be identified in every serious science. " First is the conception of being or existing in- dependent of anything else. Second is the conception of being relative to, the conception of reaction with, something else. Third is the conception of mediation, whereby a first and second are brought into relation . . . Chance is First, Law is Second, the tendency to take habits is Third " (32). Perhaps Tychism corresponds to First, Agapism to Second, and Synechism to Third. These doctrines were applied to metaphysics, psychology and biology: these different illustrations may be regarded as different " deductions of the cate- gories ". Tychism.-Chance " as an objective phenomenon " is defined as the fortuitous distribution of elements or characters-that is, their independence when ordered by a generating relation (74-76). Peirce puts forward the hypothesis that characters in the universe show a tendency towards fortuitous distribution as well as towards regularity. The hypothesis needs no explanation: for it is regu- larity that calls for explanation and not irreg4l1arity. But his hypothesis provides an explanation: (i) it explains " experimental errors " (44). These suggest chance, and no experiment can refute the suggestion. (ii) It explains diversity-the " initial configura- tion " which is a determinant in every mechanical action. The mechanist supposes " all the arbitrary specifications of the universe were introduced in one dose, in the beginning, if there was a begin- ning . . . But I, for my part, think that the diversification, the specification, has been continually taking place " (57). (iii) It explains Novelty: Time is discontinuous in the present moment and here-by sheer spontaneity-novelty is possible. Infinitesimal departures from law are always occurring-great ones, infrequently (59, 86). (iv) It explains uniformity, habit, law. Any given law is due to a general tendency towards uniformity, but this tendency is a chance development: " underlying all other laws is the only tendency which can grow by its own virtue, the tendency of all things to take habits " (10ig). (v) Chance explains non-conservative processes (e.g., organic growth)-it provides the only explanation of their irreversibility (71-72). (vi) It explains mind and con- sciousness. These are treated as epiphenomena by mechanistic philosophy: "It enters consciousness under the head of sundries, as a forgotten trifle; its scheme of the universe would be more satisfactory if this little fact could be dropped out of sight " (61). The law of mind-of truth and error-requires Chance. In general, chance explains " Variety, Uniformity, and the passage of Variety into Uniformity " (97). In IOIg we have a good short summary of the thesis. Synechism.-There follows a psychological deduction: the ex- position of mind, chiefly by the use of the mathematical concept</page><page sequence="3">396 CRITICAL NOTICES: of continuity. This is defined (120-126) by reference to Cantor's concatenation and perfection, and re-defined (174 ff.) by the intro- duction of the principle that " whatever is continuous has material parts " (i.e., a multiple set of homogeneous parts). There are special applications of the doctrine to Space and Time (82-87, 210-213). The application to Mind is as follows: (i) Feelings have temporal spread: " we are immediately conscious through an infinitesimal interval of time " (110 : see also volume i, Book iii). (ii) Feelings have intensive continuity-this is presupposed by the continuity of change (132). (iii) They lbave spatial extension: an agitation (liquefaction) spreads from one point in a protoplasm continuously through the environment: " Whatever there is in the whole pheno- menon to make us think there is feeling in such a mass of protoplasm . . . goes logically to show that that feeling has a subjective, or substantial, spatial extension, as the excited state has " (133). (iv) Feelings affect each other: that is, many agitations in one proto- plasm combine their effects, much as many waves of sound do: and a general idea is nothing other than such a combination of feelings (137, 142). (v) The manner of such combinations is not ab- solutely uniform: there is a certain arbitrariness in them (154). (vi) The unity of a personality is nothing other than a very special unity of feelings-that is, a spatial sort of general idea (270-271). (vii) One mind communicates feeling to another through various media-these include animate objects (hands, lips, lungs) and in- animate objects (books, the air). Peirce holds that the suscepti- bility to ideas of both animate and inanimate objects supports the important conclusion that both are in some degree mental- that we have a world of pure feeling (158). This fits in with the principle that spontaneity, creativity, is to be found everywhere in the universe, and with the principle of continuity. Realism, Idealism, Evolution.-These psychological arguments support Scholastic Realism: "general ideas are not mere words but they are just as much, or rather far more, living realities than the feelings themselves out of which they are concreted " (152 see also the letter to James in Perry, op. cit., ii, 424). There is nothing unreal about the agitation of a protoplasm: why then doubt the reality of a pattern of such agitations ? Objective Idealism also follows: " we ought to suppose a continuity between the characters of mind and matter, so that matter would be nothing but mind that had such indurated habits as to cause it to act with a peculiarly high degree of mechanical regularity" (277). And the whole universe is liable to change-laws as well as particulars; the whole Platonic world is " evolutionary in its origin ". Agapism.-Peirce has shown that reality is social and that change takes place by effort, the " Eros-exuberance love " of minds, communicating general ideas in a mental continuum. So that Agapism is what " Synechism calls for ". He examines three rival theories of evolution and supports a Lamarckian view that change</page><page sequence="4">Collected Papers of C. S. Peirce, Vol. VI. 397 comes about mainly by effort leading to new habit. Mere Tychism (chance variation) and mere Anancasm (necessary variation) are "degenerate cases " of Agapigm. Practical Beliefs about the Universe.-These are distinguished from scientific beliefs (216): I gather that Peirce regarded as a reasonable religious belief, one which (a) is not adequately supported by systematic, deliberately collected evidence; (b) is not incom- patible with beliefs so established; (c) is corrigible by reference to beliefs so established; (d) is an answer to a question which must be answered if unavoidable action is to be taken; (e) is actually founded upon an enormous mass of evidence never consciously observed or analysed. Peirce described himself as " an individual whose unbiased study of scientific logic has led him to conclusions not discordant with traditional dogmas " (446). What are the relevant conclusions ? In all nature, Chance (eros) has led to some degree of order (401). The unity of the whole may be described as the Mind of God (199). This is a figure of sypeech to the scientist, but of pragmatic value to the man of action. Every man, in his " musement," may frame this hypothesis and will find support for it in his pure feeling. (It is anthropomorphic, but after all the universe is mental, and a human mind is a fairly highly developed one: why regard the universe as inferior? Why study, as White- head says, only the minds of savages and morons?) But we are not justified in ascribing to the universe any particular moral character (422). Reality is social, but the eros is not directly op- posed to hatred-rather it requires hatred and evil as a necessary object. (" Evil-i.e., what it is man's duty to fight, being one of the major perfections of the universe ", 479.) To any narrower religion, the spirit of science is hostile (426). Character of Religion.-It follows that religion is moral and social. "Religion is a life, and can be identified with a belief only provided that belief be a living belief " (439). The basis of religion is in the society, the Church. For here men may find " a life broader than their narrow personalities, a life rooted in the very being of truth" (451)-that is, the truths of synechism and agapism. The church is the continuum of minds, raised to higher levels of richness, mean- ing, harmony and contrast. In the church, in society, we have our immortality-our perpetual influence. Peirce is sceptical about any other form of survival. What do the Three Categories mean ?-It will be seen that Peirce intended his Scientific Metaphysics to be judged as an exposition of his three categories. But even a Hegelian (who might share Peirce's triadicism) could not say that this volume makes their meaning clear. As universal categories, however, they ought not to be novel, and ought to be recognisable upon reflection. Peirce insisted on this in a letter to James: " It rather annoys me to be told that there is anything novel in my three categories; for if they have not, however confusedly, been recognised by men since</page><page sequence="5">398 CRITICAL NOTICES: men began to think, that condemns them at once " (1903, Perry, op. cit., ii, 428). Two previously unpublished passages (189-237, dated 1899, and 338-348, dated 1909) seem to me particularly important as evidence of what he meant-and also of his difficulty in saying what he meant. Firstness is described in three different ways. It is " potentiality of this or that sort-that is, some quality " -that is, it is the realm of universals. But also it is Chance-" mere sporting "; and again it is feeling-a simple unitary consciousness. Negatively it is described as not rational, general or continuous, but capable of being rationalised and generalised. Secondness is actuality, event, the vividness of reaction here and now. It too is feeling, but a feeling of contrast, connection: one feeling rising into consciousness and modifying a previous feeling; achieving some possibility and excluding others. It is possibility become deter- minate and concrete. Thirdness is described as habit, order, law. It is a connection of actuals, hence of feelings, hence it is Generality. It is continuity, society, relation, sign (344). And it is essentially transitional, since law changes: Thirdness is Evolution. These descriptions suggest most immediately the cosmology of Prof. Whitehead. (See especially his " Categories of Explanation " in Process and Reality, the paper on " Objects and Subjects " in Adventures of Ideas and chapter x of Science and the Modern World. These would, I think, have made a great appeal to Peirce.) But it is as if Peirce had confused together (as Firstness) both the in- determinacy of universals with the chance or random features of the concrete : that is, the Platonic Unlimited with the Limits. The Limits are indeterminate as to their ingression in actual objects, but are entirely definite in their (necessary) relations one with another. (e.g., Phaedo, 102). The Apeiron seems, on the other hand, to stand for the fact that the inter-relations of concrete things cannot be stated quite definitely. Owing to this confusion of Peirce's it is hard to know whether we ought to " recognise " Firstness as Actuality (feeling) or as Possibility, and whether we ought to " recog- nise " Firstness or Thirdness as the Limits, the External Objects. The first confusion he himself seems to notice (217 ff.) " A pos- sibility, then . . . is a particular tinge of consciousness. I do not say the possibility is exactly a consciousness, a potential conscious- ness. However, the distinction is little more than verbal." It is in this context that he does seem to introduce a Fourth-the primi- tive origin and togetherness, in which anything might happen. I think his cosmology would have been more intelligible if he had developed this Fourthness: but perhaps the Hegelian triad really has a meaning that has quite escaped me. Peirce and German Idealism.-Peirce's debt to Plato, Aristotle, and their mediwval followers is apparent: but he was perhaps even more influenced by Kant, Schelling and Hegel. He boasts that his logic is post-Kantian and post-Hegelian (226): that is, the laws of the phenomenal world are psychological. But he holds-against</page><page sequence="6">Collected Papers of C. S. Peirce, Vol. VI. 399 Hegel-that these laws are not narrowly rational, are changeable, and are real in the Realists' sense. To Kant's ethical writings, and to Schelling's inferences from them, Peirce also owes- very much. It is only in action that we make the real world, and overcome the antinomy of freedom and determinism. It is in effort (said Schelling) that evolution comes about-in the effort of the knower and the artist as well as of the doer. And in this action we realise that the world is of one substance with ourselves. And this effort is evoked by Evil, and without it the world would die of inertia. Peirce wrote to James: " If you were to call my philosophy Schellingism transformed in the light of modern physics, I should not take it hard " (Perry, op. cit., ii, 416). This " Schelling-fashioned Idealism " he drew partly from the American Transcendentalists of the 'fifties. (" I was born and bred in the neighbourhood of Concord-I mean in Cambridge.") His father frequently met Emerson at the Saturday Club in Boston in the days when Emerson, Thoreau, Alcott and Hawthorne had made their village the intellectual centre of New England. " Scientific Metaphysics."-It is possible, perhaps, to divide the teaching of this volume into three groups. First are hypotheses relating to one or more experimental sciences. These certainly refer us to observation for their support or refutation. But usually no definite experiments could be suggested which would prove the hypothesis superior to the many rivals that have been (or might be) formulated. The best example is his molecular theory of the for- mation of habits in protoplasm (275 f.). These hypotheses would to-day be regarded as scientific but not metaphysical. Second are his practical beliefs, religious and social. It seems to me that he gives a good general account of such beliefs and defends their rationality and importance. His own particular beliefs naturally reflect the " intellectual climate" of his day and country: but some at least are of great and permanent value. Third are his categories and allied principles. These are certainly not (as Peirce said that they were) " observational ". We may regard them as clear and distinct ideas or as principles of the understanding or as principles of the syntax of any language used to convey information about the world. " My philosophy, and all philosophy worth attention ", wrote Peirce in 1897, " reposes entirely upon the theory of logic " (Perry, op cit., ii, 419). But I do not think Peirce could ever have been persuaded to regard his categories as quasi-syn- tactical principles. The editors are again to be congratulated warmly upon their thorough and highly skilful work. KARL BRITTON.</page></plain_text>
