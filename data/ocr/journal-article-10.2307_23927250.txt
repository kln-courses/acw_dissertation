Ryan and Geoffrey Hartman, among others, this essay examines Shelley's poetic treatment of religion. It takes its title and cue from the poet's assertion in 'A Defence of Poetry' that 'all original religions are allegorical or susceptible of allegory, and like Janus have a double face of false and true'. In the first section, it argues that Shelley is a pivotal figure for any reflections on poetry and belief because he emerges as a chief exemplar of that moment when Romanticism expli citly secularises religion, when poetry discovers and celebrates its onerous, significant role as unmasker of the claims of dogma. In the second section, close readings of passages seek to demonstrate the ways in which Shelley subsumes religion into forms of poetic imagining. The third section explores The Triumph of Life as a poem in which Shelley offers one of his most demanding and fascinating investigations of spiritual value. It argues that the poem, like much of Shelley's greatest poetry, never wholly disallows the possibility that what it calls 'the realm without a name' is a potentially numinous space. Meditation on the absence or unknowableness of a transcendental signified abides as a presence in Shelley's work. Perhaps only a flamboyantly self-designating atheist would have had the 'Supreme Cause' so much on the brain.1 If that which is rejected always returns, then it is inevitable as well as slightly odd that someone thrown out of Oxford for refusing to disavow authorship of a pamphlet called The Necessity of Atheism, and who signed himself in Greek in the register of the Hotel de Londres, Chamonix, 23 July 1816 as 'a lover of mankind, democrat and atheist',2 should spend a great deal of his time thinking about God and religion.

Yet even when his thinking is most bluntly polemical, doubleness haunts his speculations. Of the exclamation, 'There is no God!' he writes in a note: 'This negation must be understood solely to affect a creative Deity. The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit coeternal with the universe, remains unshaken' (p. 79). This formulation might have one eye on the orthodox thought-police, allowing the young revolutionary a queasily Deist or Spinozan bolthole. But it also expresses a deep conviction about the need not to have deep convictions when convic tion is not present. Shelley does not mind leaving 'unshaken' a 'hypothesis'; he does mind the idea of being forced to believe. Hence he recycles material from The Necessity of Atheism to sustain the argument, derived from the em piricist notion that ideas emerge from reorganised sensations, that 'When a proposition is offered to the mind, it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed. A perception of their agreement is termed belief' Such a perception, Shelley contends, is 'passive', even if the mind is 'active in the investigation' that precedes the perception. Therefore, he rejects the idea that 'belief is an act of volition' or that it is right to attach 'a degree of criminality to disbelief (p. 79). This may seem casuistical, at best a form of logic-chopping designed to wrong-foot bigots and zealots, since Shelley's distinction between final 'belief and the mind's preliminary work of'investigation' seems specious. It is at odds with what occurs in his greatest poetry, in which the interplay between ac tivity and passivity, investigation and final outcome is subtle, dynamic, and open to unexpected possibilities. And yet, if one grants the early Shelley his premiss, it is evident from his poetry that, in it, the supposition of beliefs very passivity means that disbelief, if it should operate at the level of the willed, cannot always be sustained. As Robert M. Ryan remarks, 'Observing a kind of Blakean dialectic, Shelley expresses the paradox that atheism allows religious speculation a kind of spontaneity and freedom that would be denied by any formal creed.'3 Nowhere does this wavering of a premeditated stance show itself more than in the way in which the language of the Bible, incessantly reorchestrated, sounds throughout his work. If this language undergoes secu larised transformation, it often trails clouds of disconcerting sacredness. In 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty', Shelley asserts that Intellectual Beauty 'Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream' (36), adapting for his own ends John 1: 17, which rejoices that 'grace and truth came by Jesus Christ'. Christ may have given way to the poem's enigmatic 'thou' (14), but the need for 'grace and truth', and for mediating intercession ('Thy light alone' (32)), remains. The question arises: what if your ideological foe is in some way your im agination's or your heart's ally? Or, phrased differently, can we assume that Shelley's reworking of Christianity always displays a rational, agnostic control</page><page sequence="3">34 MICHAEL O'NEILL over the original? By the time of'A Defence of Poetry' written in 1821, some sixteen months before his death, a death greeted with some ill-concealed gloating by the conservative press (John Bull noted that the drowned poet had been seeking to 'coalesce with some others of his own opinions to write down Christianity'),4 Shelley was able to speak of 'religion' at least in terms which seem almost conciliatory: 'Poets' by whom he means 'those who im agine and express [an] indestructible order' include among their number 'teachers, who draw into a certain propinquity with the beautiful and the true that partial apprehension of the agencies of the invisible world which is called religion. Hence' he continues, 'all original religions are allegorical or susceptible of allegory, and like Janus have a double face of false and true' ('A Defence of Poetry', p. 677). 'Original religions' is a phrase that implies a Vico-like sense of history obeying cycles, a critique, perhaps, of religion as a supposedly time-transcending body of truths, but also a tribute to 'religions' as a binding together of poetically generated 'apprehensions'. Indeed, Vico's com ment that 'the origin of poetry' can be related to the fact that 'the proper subject of poetry is a believable impossibility' resonates with aspects of Shelley's paradoxical view of religion in 'A Defence of Poetry'. Vico refers to 'a hidden sense that nations have of God's omnipotence'.5 Shelley's position is more that poetry answers to, speaks of and from, and itself offers ways in which to imagine 'the divinity in man' ('A Defence of Poetry', p. 698). In his arresting phrase, 'a double face of false and true', Shelley suggests that what is 'true' about 'all original religions' links with their susceptibility to 'allegory', that is, to some kind of non-literal mode of understanding, and with their 'partial apprehension of the agencies of the invisible world'. The formulation implies that there is 'an invisible world' with 'agencies' which religion does it best to apprehend, but does so only 'partially'. To grant as much is to concede a great deal, and shows how Shelley's career involves a constantly shifting view of the relationship between poetry and religion. He is a pivotal figure for any reflections on poetry and belief because he represents a cultural development of great significance, emerging as a chief exemplar of that moment when Romanticism explicitly secularises religion, when poetry discovers and celebrates its onerous, significant role as unmasker of the claims of dogma and metaphorically self-aware hierophant of the poetics of belief. In his work, Shelley poeticises the nature of belief; in it, belief turns into a crossroads where breakdown and breakthrough double up as one another, crisis and possibility exchange surreptitious glances, metaphor and fact engage in an endless arm-wrestle. Robert Browning thought that 'had Shelley lived he would have finally ranged himself among the Christians'.6 In doing so, he indicates how Shelley lends himself to conservative or orthodox recuperation by those who wish to align the evident spirituality of his work with their own religious quests. If this recuperation can falsify the record of Shelley's</page><page sequence="4">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 35 intransigent opposition to Christian religion, it responds to the invitation, extended by the poet's work, for the scattered 'Ashes and sparks' ('Ode to the West Wind', 67) of his words to kindle a variety of inspirations in the minds of his readers. That said, Browning's scenario of a poet ranging himself among his most explicit ideological foes would have difficulty in accommodating the evidence of a late letter (29 June 1822); this is Shelley writing some nine days before his death: It seems to me that things have now arrived at such a crisis as requires every man plainly to utter his sentiments on the inefficacy of the existing religions no less than political systems for restraining &amp; guiding mankind. Let us see the truth whatever that may be. The destiny of man can scarcely be so degraded that he was bom only to die; and if such should be the case, delusions, especially the gross &amp; preposterous ones of the existing religion, can scarcely be supposed to exalt it.7 Even here, Shelley's objection to the 'delusions' of 'the existing religion' (presumably that of the Established Church of England) do not seem to come from the usual robustly hopeless quarter from which we learn that Death is 'The anaesthetic from which none come round', as Larkin phrases it with a soured melodiousness in 'Aubade'. Rather, Shelley objects elusively to the notion that human beings were 'born only to die'. Yet the notion that we are born for something better can also seem a delusion. Commenting on Goethe's Faust some weeks earlier, he writes that the poem is 'an unfit study for any person who is a prey to the reproaches of memory, and the delusions of an imagination not to be restrained'. Those imaginative 'delusions', not wholly separable from the kinds of longing that lead others to construct tran scendental absolutes, are, on reflection, worth entertaining. He goes on: Perhaps all discontent with the less (to use a Platonic sophism) supposes the sense of a just claim to the greater, and that we admirers of Faust are in the right road to Paradise. Such a supposition is not more absurd, and is certainly less demoniacal than that of Wordsworthâwhere he says This earth, Which is the world of all of us, &amp; where 9 We find our happiness or not at all. Shelley is misquoting lines excerpted from the Prelude in The Friend (26 October 1809) and in Wordsworth's 1815 Poems, under the title 'The French Revolution, As it appeared to Enthusiasts at its Commencement'. In those lines Wordsworth speaks of 'the very world which is the world / Of all of us, the place in which, in the end, / We find our happiness, or not at all'</page><page sequence="5">36 MICHAEL O'NEILL (The Prelude, 1805, X. 725â7).10 This is strange: you would expect the rhap sodically Utopian poet of Prometheus Unbound to welcome such humanist urgency, but, to the contrary, Shelley, by 1822, is on the side of those whom nothing will ever satisfy, searching for 'something evermore about to be' (The Prelude, 1805, VI, 542): potentially, one might wish to say, a quasi-religious state. At times it seems that the upshot of Shelley's contemplations, as he surveyed what seemed to him to be the post-Enlightenment wreckage of the Christian system, was the capacity of human beings to create systems that would be wrecked. Echoing Milton's 'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity', his choral lyric in Hellas beginning 'Worlds on worlds are rolling ever' (197) laments in its third stanza that 'The Powers of earth and air / Fled from the folding star of Bethlehem' (230-1). On the Olympians 'killing Truth had glared' (234). The echo points up a dissimilarity. Milton, the Christian poet, surprises by elegising the vanishing of Pagan gods. Shelley, the supposedly anti-Christian poet, identifies Christianity with 'killing Truth'. It may be that he is dramatising the cultural predispositions of a chorus composed, after all, of 'Greek Captive Women' (p. 551) with no love of Islam. And a note invites us to see the Chorus's view of religions as historically relativised: 'The popular notions of Christianity are represented in this chorus as true in their relation to the worship they superseded, and that which in all probability, they will super sede, without considering their merits in a relation more universal' (p. 584). Yet, as this note partly leads us to discover, the inflections of the lyric are antiphonal and complex. The chorus hails the triumph of Christianity over Islamâ'The cross leads generations on' (224) while 'The moon of Mahomet / Arose, and it shall set' (221-2)âeven as it is saddened by the vanishing of 'the golden years' (238), namely, the era associated with Hellenic myth. The lyric differs from the prose gloss of the note in that it cannot wholly sustain an intricately progressivist position. Its movement, as often in Hellas, begins as though seeking to trace a meliorist, even Utopian trajectory, but ends with a falling away from such an upward construction of history. But the lyric's reference to Christ as 'A power from the unknown God' (211) brings into the reader's mind the possibility of an absolute ('the unknown God') removed from the endless coming and going of 'New gods' (208) mentioned in the chorus's first stanza. At the same time, such is the suggestive instability of the writing, the 'unknown God' may stand less for some ultimate reality than for human beings' persist ent need to believe in such a reality. As Bryan Shelley has shown, Hellas swerves away from Christianity in the act of approaching it. It evokes as one of its analogues, not only Aeschylus' The Persians but also the Book of Daniel, yet the poem's differences from biblical apocalypse are real. In</page><page sequence="6">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 37 particular, 'Hellas presents no overruling God superintending the revolution . 11 ary process. Christianity and Shelleyan thought in Hellas run in swift, uneasy parallel lines. Ahasuerus, as Bryan Shelley notes, echoes the New Testament when he instructs the anxiety-ridden and power-shedding Mahmud: 'Wouldst thou behold the future?âask and have! / Knock and it shall be opened' (803-4). For Bryan Shelley, the echo of Matthew 7: 7 points up a sharp difference between Jesus characterising 'the relationship between earthly man and his heavenly Father' and Ahasuerus who would 'obliterate the dis tinctions between temporal and eternal, past and present'.12 But the fact that Shelley turns to such biblical language illustrates how profoundly such lan guage presents itself to him as a medium for conveying the possibility of consciousness-altering apprehensions. At the poem's close the choms imagines another turn of the cycle when 'Saturn and Love their long repose / Shall burst, more bright and good / Than all who fell, than One who rose, / Than many unsubdued' (1090-3). Shelley's note spells out his hostility to deities worshipped by various post-Saturnian creeds and cults, Christianity among them. Yet if the note serves to shock the orthodox, especially in its uncen sored form in which the poet refers to the deity of Christianity as 'a Demon, who tempted, betrayed and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by his sole will', the praise of 'the sublime human character of Jesus Christ' (p. 587) bespeaks a need on Shelley's part to re-define Christianity in humanist terms. Praising the greatest Protestant and Catholic epics, Shelley wishes a plague upon their sectarian houses, but offers hosannas for their quality of poetic imagination: 'The Divina Commedia and Paradise Lost have conferred upon modern mythology a systematic form; and when change and time shall have added one more superstition to the mass of those which have arisen and decayed upon the earth, commentators will be learnedly employed in elucidating the religion of ancestral Europe, only not utterly forgotten because it will have been stamped with the eternity of genius' ('A Defence of Poetry', p. 692). This passage was reworked in 'A Defence of Poetry' from an earlier prose work, the essay, On the Devil, and Devils, an essay even more intransigent in its opposition to 'the popular creed'. If for Matthew Arnold, poetry was destined to replace religion, for Shelley, religion is always a form, albeit a distorted form, of poetry. Poetry, for the Shelley of 'A Defence of Poetry', does not usurp religion; it is what religion always was, a mode of imagining. And it is no small part of Milton's and Dante's achievement to bring this fact, however unconsciously on their part, to the fore: '[Dante's] apotheosis of Beatrice in Paradise, and the gradations of his own love and her loveliness, by which as by steps he feigns himself to have ascended to the throne of the Supreme Cause, is the most glorious imagination of modem poetry'</page><page sequence="7">38 MICHAEL O'NEILL (pp. 690â1). 'As by steps he feigns himself: even as Wallace Stevens' Supreme Fiction beckons, what lends energising tension to Shelley's understanding of religion is a dual sense at work here. Feigning is what we do to understand; we cannot know save through 'the human mind's imaginings' ('Mont Blanc', 143). Yet this fact does not mean that reality is the sum of those imaginings, merely the means by which we seek access to it. It is tempting but over-simplifying to see Shelley as a child of Enlightenment thought, scoffing at the superstitious follies of religion. Here is the poet in 1817, hitting his rationalist, shrewdly evocative stride in Laon and Cythna, as Cythna asks: What then is God? Some moon-struck sophist stood Watching the shade from his own soul upthrown Fill Heaven and darken Earth, and in such mood The Form he saw and worshipped was his own, His likeness in the world's vast mirror shown; And 'twere an innocent dream, but that a faith Nursed by fear's dew of poison, grows thereon, And that men say, God has appointed Death On all who scorn his will, to wreak immortal wrath. (8. 6. 3244-52) Cythna's Enlightenment instruction uses the sinuous rhymes and rhythms of the Spenserian stanza to convey ideas that entwine an Enlightenment critique of superstition with Romanticism's own form of deconstruction. Such deconstruction involves an undeceived awareness of the role played by imaginative projection in all human constructions of meaning, an aware ness shown, for example, by Coleridge in 'Dejection: An Ode' ('we receive but what we give', 47).13 Volney, too, in The Ruins of Empire is one of a number of Enlightenment sceptics (other are Holbach, Condorcet, and, closer to home, Paine) who would have influenced Cythna's sceptically nominalist perspective. He writes, for example, of primitive man that, 'substituting a phantastical world to [sic] the real one, he peopled it with imaginary beings, to the terror of his mind and the torment of his race'.14 From this perspective, 'God' is just a word, corresponding to no objective reality; it names something to which 'moon-struck' mortals give meaning, solipsistically making the world a 'vast mirror' reflecting only their projected 'likeness'. This 'likeness' forgets its origin and nature, mistakenly supposing that the 'Form' it assumes has an independent reality.</page><page sequence="8">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 39 Richard Dawkins might applaud such resolute agnosticism. Yet where do our best hopes derive? God might be an 'innocent dream', we notice, were it not for the uses to which He can be put. Later in the poem, Cythna, antici pating the imagery and argument of 'Ode to the West Wind', speaks of the way in which hope is sustained: 'In their own hearts the earnest of the hope / Which made them great, the good will ever find' (9. 27. 3703-4). Hope, the sense that the world can be bettered, seems to grow in the same place, 'their own hearts' as God, the product of the distorting aspirations projected by 'his own soul'. The stanza goes on to assert the ever-present functioning of Necessity, which will ensure that any 'envious shade' (3706) that comes be tween the 'effect' (3705) of such an 'earnest' and itself will be rendered null and void. Necessity allows Shelley to believe that 'Evil with evil, good with good must wind /In bands of union' (3709-10). This trust in the adamantine chain of causal links caused by human 'good' (and 'evil') accompanies tenaciously and with a flicker of contradictoriness mockery of the Christian idea that 'the cause of life could think and live' (8. 5. 3237), rejected as illicit anthropomorphism in such works as A Refutation of Deism. In this work, which stages a dialogue between an orthodox believer, Eusebes, and a deist, Theosophus, Shelley adeptly undercuts rational argu ments in favour of Christianity, leaving the outcome to be a choice between blind faith and atheism. And yet among the arguments that are used to dis credit belief in God is one that threatens to boomerang against Shelley's own atheism: it is the contention that because we cannot, following Hume, have knowledge of 'causation', 'it would be inadmissible to deduce the being of a God from the existence of the Universe'. Again, Shelley adds, and can be understood in so doing to be speaking his own view, that 'If Power be an attribute of existing substance, substance could not have derived its origin from power'.15 But in 1817, Shelley would publish 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty', in which he hails 'The awful shadow of some unseen Power' (1). The same year, he published 'Mont Blanc', at the close of which he asserts that 'the power is there, / The still and solemn power of many sights' (127-8). The addition of the definite article makes it hard to avoid the view that this 'power' is, indeed, the attribute of 'being', and not necessarily a 'being' bestowed by human projection, even though the 'human mind's imaginings' make possible its suppositious existence. We need almost a new term for Shelley's fluidity of attitude: believing unbelief, perhaps, or unbelieving belief. Much critical writing on Shelley's religion tries to claim the poet for a hard-headed rational scepticism, which is often only almost true, as the critic, albeit reluctantly, will admit. An example is Kenneth Neill Cameron who asserts in successive paragraphs about the 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty' that 'The experience in the poem is neither mystical nor Platonic', but that 'the language of the poem conveys a sense of</page><page sequence="9">40 MICHAEL O'NEILL hope and feeling beyond scepticism, as do some prose passages in the Essay on Christianity and "A Defence of Poetry" This, Cameron explains, is because 'in impassioned creative writing, the emotions tend to take over and to force the writer's language beyond what he may rationally believe'.16 Such an as sertion is radically misleading about the function of poetic language, which is heuristic and exploratory in a way that Cameron ignores. Shelley can express views that anticipate an 'as if outlook. So, in the Conclusion to The Sensitive Plant, he rounds out his parable of beauty destroyed, fairy tale turned into Gothic nightmare, with the wryly and yet triumphantly consoling reflection that in this life Of error, ignorance, and strife, Where nothing is, but all things seem, And we the shadows of the dream, It is a modest creed, and yet Pleasant if one considers it, To own that death itself must be, Like all the rest, a mockery. (9âr6) If Shelley mocks himself as he mockingly discovers meaning in the fact or supposition that all is mockery, his language contrives, too, to remain yieldingly open to the solicitations of desire: 'the shadows of the dream', for example, give a sudden, intensified ontological stability to the dream, with an underlying hint that there is an awakened state beyond it.17 This Shelley is engaged in what Zygmunt Bauman refers to as 'the "re enchantment" of the world after the protracted and earnest, though in the end inconclusive modem struggle to dis-enchant it'.18 But it is a desperate gamble at the same time, albeit a gamble that differs in its modus operandi from the act of self-consciously and self-protectively offering always and only 'fictions'. Instead, Shelley occupies an imagined state, seeing what emerges in the pro cess of writing, and doing so, he was conscious that such stanzaic unfurling might provide, in Keats's phrase, 'a regular stepping of the Imagination towards a Truth': arguably, the only 'Truth' available to both poets.19 One idea or desperate hope that Shelley could never relinquish finds expression in a number of places. It is the idea expressed in some fragmentary stanzas ('Frail clouds arrayed in sunlight lose their glory') 'apparently intended to serve as a meditative opening to Laon and Cythna': here is the third and crucial stanza: There is a Power whose passive instrument Our nature isâa Spirit that with motion</page><page sequence="10">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 41 Invisible and swift its breath hath sent Amongst us, like the wind on the wide Oceanâ Around whose path the tumult and commotion Throng fastâdeep calm doth follow, and precedeth. This Spirit, chained by some remote devotion, Our choice or will demanded not nor heedeth But for its hymns doth touch the human souls it needeth. (19-27)20 Wasserman writes of the 'quasi-theological myth' 21 developed in the passage, and from the opening assertion, 'There is a Power', the writing gleams with an unanswerable authority. This is more than a naming; it is also a conjuration. Through the fleet, hushed, controlled movement of the verse, there is the sense of an assured intuition that is too subtle for rational disquisition and too self-aware to be dismissed as homespun religious enthusiasm. Shelley is af fected by the thought that we are the 'passive instrument' of 'some Power', that human souls are the trumpet of a prophecy that originates beyond them. This Power or Spirit sounds like a cross between a revelation of Godhead and a muse; it can be secularised, humanised, but it articulates a sensed connection between poetic inspiration and what is difficult not to term religious experience. In 'Frails clouds arrayed in sunlight like the glory', there is a rich, syntactical ambiguity in Shelley's assertion that the Spirit is 'chained by some remote devotion': the wording might imply that the chaining devotion is the Spirit's to us or ours to it. In 'Ode to the West Wind', Shelley both celebrates and confronts the Spirit, and reconsiders the question of reciprocal influence. The poem tries to net the Spirit through metaphors, continually raiding the religious word-hoard: 'hear, O, hear!' (14) concludes the first of the couplets trans forming each section's terza rima into a sonnet. The couplet acts as a stay against the onward momentum of the wind, the holy spirit turned into its uncanny opposite. The 'breath of Autumn's being' (1), and an 'unseen pres ence' (2), it reminds the reader, too, of different theologies and theodicies when named as simultaneously 'Destroyer and Preserver' (14), Siva as well as Vishnu.22 Beyond that, the wind manifests itself as an Orphic storm that not only threatens corrupt regimes but recalls through its operations in the upper air 'the bright hair uplifted from the head//Of some fierce Maenad' (20-1), bringing to mind the legendary followers and ecstatic slayers of the archetypal poet.23 Shelley does what Eliot does in 'What the Thunder said', the fifth and final section of The Waste Land: he enters his own phantasmagoria, in which reli gious and mythic images swim into his mind rather as they will do in Rimbaud's prose poem from 'A Season in Hell': 'Jesus walked on the troubled</page><page sequence="11">42 MICHAEL O'NEILL waters. The lantern showed us him standing, in white and with brown tresses, on the flank of an emerald wave.. ,.'24 There is a kinship between this vi sionary blurring and collapsing of gospel and reverie, between the rehearsed proto-Christological humiliation of 'I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!' ('Ode to the West Wind', 54), and Eliot's 'agony in stony places / The shout ing and the crying' (The Waste Land, 324-5).2:&gt; Rimbaud, for his part, makes explicit the freedom to engage in hallucinatory recollection of Christianity and other religions when he asserts, with calculated bravado, 'I am about to unveil all mysteries: mysteries religious or natural, death, birth, future, past, the cosmogony, the void. I am a master of phantasmagoria'.26 All three poets arrive at the recognition, and feel on the pulses of their poetry the fact, that the poet is a seer, privileged and condemned, in his person, to reinvent the world's myths. Shelley in 'Ode to the West Wind' negotiates with belief systems; it contrives to be, in Harold Bloom's terms, 'Jobean' in its quality of struggle and deeply humanist in its assertion of its 'affirmation of images and image-making power'.27 Bloom's conjunction of suggestions is helpful, and yet the poetry's re-engagement with Christ's crucifixion, in 'I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!', is remarkable for its momentary but decisive destruc tion of cordoned-off categories such as 'religious' and 'humanist'. 'Ode to the West Wind' moves recklessly, dangerously and exhilaratingly between per sonal confession, mythologising, and constructing something upon which to rejoice. Shelley clings to prayer, even as his conviction of his powers under goes a transitional crisis, and his prayer is, ultimately, to a force both within and without: 'Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is' (57), the last stanza begins, sounding the first notes of its post-Passion recovery. The poet, who had been striving, Jacob-like, in the previous section with the 'unseen pres ence' of the Wind, gradually offers us a present-tense re-enactment of such strife, as he bends the Power to his own will: 'Be through my lips to unawakened earth/The trumpet of a prophecy!' (68â9), the relations be tween poet and wind endlessly locked in intimate and mutually inspiring struggle. In James Chandler's memorably riddling words, 'The Wind makes Shelley make the Wind make Shelley make the Wind and so on'.28 The poem can be read in more or less secular tenus, as involving the translation of motifs drawn from religion into a new and post-religious idiom. But it is more acutely read as able to destabilise the difference between the sacred and the secular, the religious and the non-religious. Above all, it is a poem that re-enacts, in its very form and onward rushing quasi-Pentecostal move ment, the poet's identification of some ultimate power with his own recov ery of inspiration.</page><page sequence="12">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 43 in It would be hard to hear any traces of the Hound of Heaven gambolling down the byways of the terza rima of The Triumph of Life. Yet the poem has a powerful sense of life as a place where and state in which ideals are brutally conquered, and energies are cruelly consumed, and of the imagination, deluded or otherwise, as exercising itself most compellingly in the presence of questions and enigmas, 'Show whence I came, and where I am, and whyâ /Pass not away upon the passing dream' (398-9), cries Shelley's double, confrÃ¨re, and familiar compound ghost, the root-resembling Rousseau, na ture's Savoyardian vicar, down on his uppers, sounding for all the world like his creator as he undergoes some kind of shattering experience in the presence of a 'shape all light' (352) who is at once emblem of transformation and a purveyor of disenchantment.29 As so often in Shelley, Milton lurks behind the text, as a complex prompter. So Rousseau's questions to the shape echo an Adamic state of disorientation when he wakes to self-consciousness: 'My self I then perused', 'But who I was, or where, or from what cause, / Knew not' (Paradise Lost, VIII. 267, 270-i).3n He then undergoes a dream in which he meets 'Presence divine' (314) that says to him, 'Whom thou sought'st I am, /... author of all this thou seest' (316-17): a sublime response that is intransitively echoic of the God who asserts 'I AM THAT I AM' (Exodus 3:i4).31 Rousseau and, indeed, Shelley have no dream from which they awaken to visions of truth. Rather, their state is permanently to know, if not wholly to assume is constitutive of reality, the despair which temporarily afflicts Adam when in a further waking dream he imagines Eve: 'She disappeared, and left me dark, I waked/To find her, or for ever to de plore / Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure' (VIII. 478â80). He does find Eve, but briefly figured there, and explaining its resonance in Shelley, is a recurrent scenario in the Romantic poet's work in which 'She disappeared, and left me dark'. And yet if the imagination deceives, it can create. Rousseau is taken into a state which might be glossed as 'unknowing'. The writing switches into the third person, as the mental or psychic trans formation he undergoes in the shape's presence takes us into a labyrinth of 'as ifs' and similes: And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot The thoughts of him who gazed on them, and soon All that was seemed as if had been not, As if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath Her feet like embers, and she, thought by thought,</page><page sequence="13">44 MICHAEL O'NEILL Trampled its fires into the dust of death. As Day upon the threshold of the east Treads out the lamps of night, until the breath Of darkness re-illumines even the least Of heaven's living eyesâlike day she came, Making the night a dream (382-93) Rousseau experiences the very passivity that Shelley associates with belief, only here neither seeming nor reality, believing or disbelieving seem some how to matter; what does matter is the evocation of a state akin to mystical annihilation that is wrought by what might be, probably is, but possibly is not, a delusion. If day extinguishes some higher power of intuition or vision, there is always the hope that 'the breath / Of darkness' will renew inspiration, allow access to some different mode of seeing; momentarily snuffed out the moment it is awakened here, this hope is poignantly reanimated when the shapeâhere figured as day extinguishing nightâsoon becomes like a star extinguished by the day (see lines 412â15), glimmering, like so many hopes in Shelley, 'forever sought, forever lost' (431). The poem's Dantescan parallels similarly shimmer, glimmer and grow dimmer throughout the poem, ultimately indicating roads not taken or takeable, baffling the would-be finder of system; but they, too, stay in the poem's sub-conscious, wandering cultural ghosts, straying in and out of a Christian belief-system that is never wholly abandoned or forgotten. All that Shelley has to follow is the winding path of poetry itself, sure, in the words of Les Murray's poem 'Poetry and Religion' that 'Religions are poems' and that the 'only whole thinking' is 'poetry'; sure, too, that 'Nothing's said till it's dreamed out in words / and nothing's true that figures in words only'. One imagines, though, that he would be more doubtful than Murray is whether 'poetry', let alone 'God', can be 'caught in any religion'.32 Through its awareness that 'nothing's true that figures in words only', however, Shelley's poetry at its most fascinating holds open a fine-spun hope that it seems right to call poetic and religious. Murray swithers between 'figures' as meaning 'making sense' and as 'serving as a figure for some prior reality', and Shelley anticipates him here, since his poetry never wholly disallows the possibility that 'the realm without a name' (396) is itself a potentially numinous space. One day, in another poem, The Triumph of Life tempts its reader to think, when, once more, 'Figures ever new / Rise on the bubble' (248â9), poetry will or might or should embody its own 'apprehension', albeit 'partial', of 'the agencies of the invisible world'.</page><page sequence="14">POETRY AND RELIGION IN SHELLEY 45 REFERENCES 'A Defence of Poetry', in Percy Bysshe Shelley: The Major Works, eds.
