<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bergson's Creation of the Possible Pete A. Y. Gunter "The Possible and the Real," Bergson insisted to Isaac Benrubi, is an important part of his philosophy (Benrubi, 306-307).1 Far from a mere, perhaps interesting adjunct to his thought, this essay (originally given at Oxford in 1920)2 both demarcates his fundamental ideas and brings out their meaning. It is therefore surprising that this essay has suffered from relative neglect. In The New Aspects of Space and Time, Milic Capek writes, "Space does not permit us to discuss here the precise meaning of the Bergsonian views on possibility which, in appearance were seemingly contradictory" (160). Unfortunately, Capek never responded to this challenge. In the text cited to above he refers the reader to the last chapter of Jankelevitch's Henri Bergson. But here Jankelevitch, besides reviewing Bergson's ideas on the possible, remarks only that besides our ordinary ideas of possibility, there is in Bergson a quite different concept of "organic" possibility - a concept which, however, Jankelevitch never worked out (Jankelevitch, 215-228). If Capek and Jankelevitch did not tackle the problem of the possible and its implications in Bergson, then surprisingly, neither did many others: for example, Jacques Maritain or Maurice Merleau-Ponty or, among other Bergson scholars, Jacques Chevalier or James Wildon Carr. The proceedings of the Bergson Conference of 1959 (the centennial of Bergson's birth) contain at most only brief allusions to the possible.3 The Bergson bibliography of 1986 contains only four references (out of 5,926) to "The Possible and the Real," and none of these discusses in detail the conceptual problems raised by this essay.4 Of six recent English-language books on Bergson, only one, by John Mularkey, offers critical reflections on what Bergson might have meant by the term possible.5 Gilles Deleuze's Bergsonism might be taken as concerted reflections on possibility and its alterity, the virtual. But Deleuze (if brilliantly) reconstructs Bergson's ideas to suit his own views (142).6 In what follows, I will first outline Bergson's critique of the idea of possibility, including his treatment of two closely allied concepts, disorder and non-being (i.e. nothingness). In the concluding section, I will point out some of the difficulties in Bergson's position as stated in "The Possible and the Real" and then show how, based on his earlier writings, Bergson believed that these problems could be overcome.

Gunter result will be an analysis of Bergsonian virtuality as revealed in his concept of the vital impetus or elan vital. I hope that this analysis will shed new light on certain aspects of Bergson's elan vital. 1. Against Prior Possibility Bergson's argument against preexistent possibilities is linked by him to two other dubious notions: that of substantive "nothing" and that of absolute disorder. All three ideas (possibility, nothingness, disorder) have the same behavioral source and lead to the same unexamined assumption. Any human project begins, he points out, from a felt lack. I do not have food, and must find some. I lack shelter, hence I must make or find it. Starting from a felt lack we find or fashion something that satisfies it. There is nothing wrong with this procedure. (Among other things, it has no practical alternative.) But just because we proceed in this way, it does not follow that nature or, more broadly, the universe does. In assuming (in line with our common behavior) that lack or emptiness proceeds being, or that the cosmos begins with a void or emptiness that must be filled, we unconsciously ally ourselves with anthropomorphism: an anthropomorphism of behavior. The same holds if we presume in the universe an initial disorder in the nature of things that must then be ordered. We do not need to follow our natural inclination in such matters. As F.T.C. Moore puts it, we can "think backwards," moving away from engrained conceptual habit and recovering data that would otherwise elude us. We can thus escape the tendency to think order before disorder, emptiness before being. Bergson's denial that possibility precedes actuality is closely linked to his treatment of disorder and non-being. There is no space here to deal in depth with the conceptual ties between these three concepts. (Essentially, Bergson believes that if we start from non-being and disorder we will be compelled to appeal to a transcendent realm of possibles to "tame" or order them, while if we start from the dynamic and funda mental creativity of things, we can come to understand the world without appeal to nothingness, radical disorder, or transcendent possibles). It will simplify the discussion to limit it in what follows to the pragmatic origins of our concept of the possible. In practical affairs we begin with a schema - a notion, more or less clear - of what we intend to do. This schema necessarily precedes its actualization, as a blueprint precedes a building or a machine. It is thus natural to assume that the universe does likewise, filling in preexistent possibilities as it goes. Or, in matters theological, it is then almost SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="3">Bergson's Creation of the Possible 35 inevitable to think of God as designing the world (the blueprint) and then filling in these possibles step by step (the creation). Platonists by nature, we seem locked into the idea that possibility must precede actuality and be more real than actuality: more real not in the sense that it is more concrete than actuality, but in the sense that without it actuality would have no form or character whatsoever. For Bergson, an intuitionist, the case is exactly opposite. He maintains that we can correct our all-too-human presumptions about possibility and actuality Indeed, he says, this is inevitable if we believe that there is real creativity, real novelty in the world. If we postulate real novelty, then it is incumbent on us to spell out its logical conditions. If creativity is seen as a choice between pre-existing possibles then a priori that which is chosen is that which has always existed, and creativity is rendered an illusion: an illusion because either alternative chosen, rather than involving novelty, involves characteristics that have always existed. But if possibility is not real, what is it? Bergson argues that it is an optical illusion, a retrospective mirage that we have inadvertently projected onto the prior past: As reality is created as something unforeseeable and new, its image is reflected behind it into the infinite past, thus it finds that it has from all time been possible, but it is at this precise moment that it begins to have been always possible, and that is why I have said that its possibility, which does not precede its reality, will have preceded it once the reality has appeared. The possible is therefore the mirage of the present in the past; and as we knowr the future will finally constitute a present and the mirage effect is continually being produced, we are convinced that the image of tomorrow is already contained in our actual present, which will be the past of tomorrow, although we do not manage to grasp it. That is precisely the illusion. (CM 111) To try to make this mirage (the present projected into the past) the basis for the actual present, he argues, is analogous to trying to make the flesh and-blood human being materialize from his or her image seen in a mirror. 2. Bergson's elan vital Were one to read in Bergson's corpus only "The Possible and the Real," one would be confronted with a serious puzzle. That is, it would seem to follow from Bergson's argument that there exists no inherent relation between the past and the present, or, put another way, that the most one can say about the present is that, given the past, there was "no insurmountable obstacle" (CM 120) to the present's actualization. Clearly, this cannot be Bergson's position. No philosopher has insisted more SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="4">36 Pete A.Y. Gunter firmly on the primacy of memory than Bergson, and for him, memory always involves the carry-over of the past into the present: This is made abundantly clear in Matter and Memory (1896), and is developed more fully in Creative Evolution (1907) in the notion of the elan vital or vital impetus. It is to this concept that I will now turn. The elan vital has few adherents in contemporary philosophy, fewer still in today's sciences. The unity of life, Bergson argues, is derived from a vis a tergo, an impetus that pushes it from its primitive beginnings to its expression in the myriad species now extant. This impetus contains the basis for the emergence of the various forms of life, as well as those forms which, given the vagaries of evolution, did not come to exist (CE 164-65). It would be wrong to assume that this basis consists of distinct "possibles." Rather, it consists of characters that interpenetrate and are to this extent indefinite: "In reality, life is of the psychological order, and it is of the essence of the psychical to enfold a confused plurality of interpenetrating terms"(CE 165). This, as Deleuze clearly saw, is one of Bergson's essential contentions (B 105-106). Creativity starts from a confused (con-fused) state and proceeds via "dissociation and division" (CE 58). The original impetus contains the basis for what will follow, but could divide differently in varying contexts (CE 165). Differences in dissociation would produce different sorts of organisms: plants more animal-like than those now extant, animals more plant-like, a humanity more instinctive or more intelligent. Dissociation/division, itself not predetermined, creates creatures whose exact features or structures could not be predicted. But the new present can never occur ex nihilo. It depends on a set of conditions?vital conditions?without which its spontaneity and creativity could not arise. Bergson uses a variety of contrasting images to try to convey the nature of his life-impetus: a steam jet (CE159), a hand thrust into iron filings (CE 61), fireworks (CE 161), physical motion (CE 59), and currents (119). Such images can be and often have been treated as crude physical analogies, or as at best, obscure. A different sort of metaphor can be offered today, however?one not available when Creative Evolution was written: that of the wave function in quantum physics, with its quantum "superposition." An in-depth account of this concept cannot be given here. What follows is a simplification. The quantum wave superposition contains all probabilities of future events within its range?possibilities that remain in suspension until precipitated by measurement. We do not know the position and momentum of, say, an electron, until we attempt a measurement of it. Measurement involves the "collapse" of the wave-function, leaving us SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="5">Bergson's Creation of the Possible 37 with a definite position or momentum, but given Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, the more precise the position, the less certain the momentum, and vice-versa.7 Precision here is bought at the cost of ambiguity, since if we choose to get an exact position, momentum becomes infinite (not allowed), and if we choose to get an exact momentum, position becomes indefinite. The effect of measurement is the at least partial elimination of dynamism and uncertainty. In the past, the restriction of such measurements to one or a few microscopic "particles" and the need to bring in a human observer or measuring instrument to make obser vations have posed a barrier to the extension of quantum physics to biology. These two impediments have recently been removed, resulting in numerous speculations on the effect of richer quantum superpositions than those involving a few electrons or protons?complex superpositions, whose collapse could transform the structure of peptide chains or DNA.8 From such preoccupations it is a short step to the notion of quantum waves at work in the course of evolution.9 The transition in Bergson from the virtual to the actual in many ways resembles the quantum transition from superposition to measured actuality. In both cases there is passage from a broad, or indefinite, thoroughly dynamic state to one that is narrower, more definite, more stable. In both cases, perfect predictability is not possible. Quantum measurement eliminates dynamism and uncertainty, replacing them with the actual and the definite. While Bergson stresses the opposition of life and matter, he also asserts that matter causes the division and dissociation of the original thrust of life (CE 84). The analog of quantum measurement would be the action of physical matter on the vital impetus, causing the "collapse" of the original impetus into kingdoms, genera, and species. In more recent quantum physics, the collapse of the wave function ("decoherence") can be occasioned by the action of any macroscopic object on the wave: this without the requirement of a measuring instrument (CE 64). Implicit in the previous discussion has been the notion of nonlocality. Einstein never ceased to protest against this concept, dismissing it as a "spooky action at a distance." Unfortunately, this sort of distant action now appears inescapable. Defenders of classical quantum physics (The "Copenhagen Interpretation") must assert the existence of a universal wave: a single massively entangled superposition. Similarly, physicist David Bohm, from his own point of view, proposes that the universe is filled with an infinite number of overlapping (pilot) waves, connecting all matter in an undivided whole.10 Quantum teleportation experiments demonstrate that information derived from a measurement at one point SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="6">38 Pete A.Y. Gunter is instantaneously transmitted to other distant places, no matter how distant. The elan vital has, among other factors, remained unintelligible precisely because of its nonlocality. This nonlocal character is found most dramatically in instances of closely similar organs appearing in widely varying species (eyes with inverted retinas in man and in the pectin, a shellfish) and in animal characteristics making their appearance in insectivores (CE 48, 70). It also appears, Bergson believes, in the innumerable shared similarities of animals and plants and in the wholeness of the evolutionary process generally (CE 69). To explain such phenomena, he argues, we must go beyond Darwin's two factors, ecological context and point mutations, and concede the existence of a single factor (to stretch the metaphor, a vital superposition) embracing the entire creative advance of nature. It would be a mistake simply to identify the vital impetus with a quantum wave-function. Unlike the wave-function, the vital impetus contains no distinct probabilities or, in a broader sense, possibilities. Its modalities interpenetrate, becoming distinct by degree only when expressed. Still, in trying to understand what Bergson means by vital impetus, one is better off working through the notions of quantum superposition and quantum wave than struggling with his dynamic but physical-material imagery. Jankelevitch was right, therefore, in speaking of an "organic possibility" in Bergson, just as others have been right in speaking of the importance of dynamic memory in his philosophy. But it is helpful to give specific content to such notions. One thus explains the preconditions of creativity without reducing them to "possibles," much less to strictly deterministic causality. In what follows, two other preconditions of free creativity will be sketched: the internal relations involved in the components of the vital impetus, and its "lawlike" routes of expression? routes always dissimilar in content but profoundly alike in general form. Though Bergson's "virtual" or "vital" impetus is described by him as "one" (CE 67,166) or a "whole" (CE 193), he does not see it as a whole without parts. The self, to take his paradigm case, is for him both one and many (CM 22-23). Its "states" (CM 38) are "real parts" (CM 30) that change internally (CM 27) in relation to each other. An external relation is a non constitutive relation?one that in no way changes the characters of its relata. An internal relation is a constitutive relation, one that (to some degree) changes the character of its related terms. Rather like A.N. Whitehead's mutually prehending actual occasions, transformations of SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="7">Bergson's Creation of the Possible 39 mutual relations between Bergsonian interpenetrating virtualities would change them without ablating their character as individual. Evolution is for Bergson decidedly not an immense mind or person. But it is (as noted above) "of a psychological order." The inner life, he insists, contains the same multiple unity as life in general. How does this interplay of multiplicity (real parts) and diversity (real relations) in Bergson help us? Because it allows us to see that expressions of one aspect of the impetus would have impacts on others. For Bergson, in an evolutionary series (say, the transition from chordates to primitive vertebrates to highly elaborate vertebrates) the appearance of each new instance involves transformations of fundamental "virtualities." If the Bergsonian virtual contains, at the beginning, the ground for everything that may follow, we must conceive this virtual as itself changing, through the reciprocal interactions of its parts. The first two sorts of order in Bergsonian virtuality concern the prior conditions that make creativity possible. The third concerns the structure of creative expression itself. Those familiar with Bergson's thought will find these structures familiar. Expressions of creativity, whether in biological evolution or elsewhere, for him always exhibit the same five characteristics: 1) divergence; 2) increased spatiality (Bergson uses the term "detension" (CE 130); 3) elaboration of spatial form; 4) repetition in time (CE 9); and 5) unique temporalities (biological times).11 These factors and others related to them could be profitably described at length. It is enough here, I hope, to give only this brief enumeration and to point out their ubiquity in Bergson's thought. Expansive and spontaneous, Bergsonian evolution nonetheless is structured throughout by analogous routes of expression. It thus turns out that Bergson's statements in "The Possible and the Real" can not all be taken at face value. In particular, it is not true that for him the only thing that can be said of the free, creative act is that nothing can prevent its happening. One must also say, as Bergson in fact does, that there are active prior conditions that must be met if such acts are to occur. This essay has attempted to single out these conditions and also to make them intelligible. They are (to repeat the sketch developed above) 1) a "virtuality" comprised of interpenetrating characters; 2) the dynamic and yet limited internal relatedness of these characters; and 3) routes of expression exhibiting ubiquitously common features. Bergson gives us good reasons to hold that the possible does not precede the real. But on his terms, there are multiple dynamic factors that do.
