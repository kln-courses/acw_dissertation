<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ambivalent Beginnings Strindberg, the Artist's Book, and the Foundation of Swedish Material Modernism Jon Viklund Uppsala University In uncontroversial as a Sweden sort of experimental modernism given that poetic poetic comes language modernism late. in This terms is most statement of often formal defined seems char- uncontroversial given that poetic modernism is most often defined as a sort of experimental poetic language in terms of formal char- acteristics. The "breakthrough" of these formal modernist traits did not take place in Sweden until the 1940s according to standard Swed- ish literary history (see Lönnroth &amp; Delblanc 220-59). This historical account has been challenged during recent decades. Peter Luthersson argues for a horizontal alignment of modernist texts in terms of intel- lectual history. If poetic modernism were defined more in terms of an intellectual movement- and more to the point, a movement in defense of the individual- then its breakthrough would be earlier: "Modernismens problem ... var ett jagproblem" (Luthersson 94) [the problem of modernism ... was the problem of the self]. In this article, I propose another, previously under- explored point of departure for Swedish modernist poetry in order to challenge both the formalist and intellectual-historical assumptions. I am interested in the book as a material artifact that provides a body for modernist poetic entities and confers value upon them in the literary market. Consistent with this approach, one would thus write the story of Swedish modernist poetry not as a history of poetics but as a history of the poetry book. Strindberg's 1905 collection of poetry Ordalek och smâkonst (Word Play and Minor Art) is an excellent starting point for such an account. Ordalek och smâkonst provides a means of access to a different tradition of Swedish modernist poetry than the one usually associated with it. I will refer to this tradition as Swedish material modernism. Strindberg's Ordalek och smâkonst is one of the first collections to give evidence of a tradition in which the poetic texts are intimately bound up with the</page><page sequence="2">300 Scandinavian Studies material book and the artistic as well as the monetary value of the work lies as much in the design of the book as in the texts themselves. In literary studies, the concepts of modernism and the avant-garde are often linked: the material features discussed in regard to modernism in that context are normally typographical experiments and other graphical forms connected to avant-garde movements and poets. But with a broader view of materiality, these typographical trends are just one of many forms of poetic materiality typical of Swedish twentieth-century poetry. From the beginning of the century on, one can observe in many poetic works a closer connection between poems and their bibliographic context. What made these books distinctly collections of poetry was increasingly displayed in the design of the book- for example in the cover, format, illustrations, or typographic face of the book. This intensified alliance between modern poetic styles and graphic design, I suggest, is connected to the birth of the modern book of poetry in Sweden around 1900. A modern book of poetry can plainly be defined as a collection of poetry assembled by the author and published in a bibliographic setting that reinforces the character of the work and, perhaps, also the legacy of its author. The latter part of the definition includes many artistic ideals that mark modernism. For example, the modern book of poetry is often "self-conscious about the structure and meaning of the book as a form55 (Drucker 4); it attempts to integrate images and text; it attempts to present the text as a "visible language55 (McGann, Black); and, from a more market-oriented point of view, the modern book of poetry creates a desired body for the author on the market by means of an exclusive and/or original material form. One facet of this modernist tradition of the book is the fact that col- lections of poetry tend manifestly to emphasize their material design in terms of individuality and uniqueness. These features are demonstrated in limited and numbered editions, artisťs books, and illustrated edi- tions. These materially distinct forms of publishing distinguish not only established authors, but also lesser-known and less commercial ones, who use the means of sophistication of design or a limited edition in order to generate significance in their work. The values embedded in the material design of these books such as exclusivity or originality tell us something about what a Swedish modernist collection of poetry is or is supposed to be. One might connect these features to the elitist approach of modernist literature. However, these are also effects of modernity's consumer culture, which, in regard to the book market in</page><page sequence="3">Ambivalent Beginnings 301 Sweden, originates at the end of the nineteenth century. The tradition of material modernism is thus more than a purely aesthetic movement; it is also an exponent of bourgeois culture. The notion of fine print and the deluxe edition is thus ambiguous. These books are a reaction against the industrialized book market and mass consumerism. Nevertheless, the very form of resistance installed in the work is also that which confers value to it on the market. The material framing of poetry collections in the modernist era is better understood through this historical context. Strindberg's Ordalek ochsmãkonst, published as a deluxe edition, highlights the tensions inher- ent in the work. These include tensions between dual artistic intentions and the different expectations of the author, publisher, and consumer of the book and how it should be read or used. These transactions are most apparent in poetry since this mode of imaginative communication, more than any other, has the objective to display the textual condition; these texts "operate to display their own practices, to put them forward as the subject of attention" (McGann, Textual 10-1). One fundamen- tal approach to the self-reflexive nature of poetic language is thus to investigate the poetry book's historical background: the beginning of a specific kind of visual language connected to books of poetry. The Renaissance of Printing in Sweden McGann's seminal book Black Riders: The Visible Language of Modernism (1993) argues that English modernism was formed in the renaissance of printing at the end of the nineteenth century. The modernist poetic tradition from Dickinson through Yeats, Pound, Gertrude Stein, Laura Riding, and Bob Brown goes back to William Morris and the practices of early fine printing presses like the Kelmscott Press. McGann's main point is that modernist writing is typically distinguished by, using Mor- ris's own words, a "resistance in the materials" (qtd. in Biadi xiii). The emphasis put on the production of texts and the expressiveness of mate- rial language, demonstrated in the bibliographic features of the work, is, according to McGann, at the root of modernism. He argues that such an artisanal approach is manifest also in modernist poetic practices, in its view of language, and in its use of the spatial field of the page as well as the overall bibliographic form of the book. In short, English modern poetry took shape in the printing press. "The history of modernist writ- ing could be written as a history of the modernist book" (76).</page><page sequence="4">302 Scandinavian Studies In Sweden the renaissance of printing is marked less by creative private presses and influential original poet-artist-printers like William Morris though influences from England and the continent are nevertheless apparent. It is evident that the publishing houses around 1900 took a greater interest in book design, and this goes for both major houses like Bonniers as well as smaller ones like Lagerströms and Ljus (all of which published works of Strindberg).1 An increasing number of books were also manufactured as unique objects, that is, as numbered editions (and many publishers made use of well-established authors like Strindberg).2 Book design in general went through rapid changes in late nineteenth century. As in many other European countries, printing techniques shifted during this period from manual to mechanical typesetting, which were part of general changes in industrial techniques for book produc- tion. As with Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement in England, albeit not expressed ideologically and politically, there was a reaction to the industrialization of the book market that entails a demand for fine prints, exclusive editions, as well as unique and individual books. This development in the book market coincides with the foundation of the modern poetry book as defined earlier. More than any other literary genre, poetry is tied to the material setting of the text. Whereas modernist poetic writing is closely linked to a particular form of language use that has a poetic function, the form of the book is more broadly associated with certain functions that have both aesthetic and social implications. The material book lends the work a character or identity so as to fit in a certain literary exchange; examples include expressive typography that signals the author's alliance to modernist aesthetics. Also, the biblio- graphic framing of the book discloses the social meaning of the author's text. An expensive and elaborated material form of a poetic work may, for example, make it useful in new contexts (e.g. for collectors). At the i. One should mention here, on the one hand, the deluxe editions published by Lager- ströms, Antibarbarus (1906) and Laokoon (1917), as well as, on the other, Ljus's cheap edition (in booklet for 10 öre) Svenska öden och äfrentyr: Berättelser frãn alla tidehvarf (1907) ; these and other publications bear evidence of the clear influence ofWilliam Morris. 2. As part of a discussion about Strindberg's relation to his publishers, Gedin draws attention to several numbered editions of Strindberg's works between 1906 and 1911: Antibarbarus (Lagerströms, i9o6),Afö#£rO/öf(Versuppl., Lagerströms, 1909), Direktor ens prolog (Swanströms, 1910), Kina och Japan (Björck &amp; Börjesson, 19u), En extra bla bok (Björck &amp; Börjesson, 1912), Kinesiska spràkets härkomst I- II (Björck &amp; Börjesson, 1912). As Gedin suggests, most of these books were not primarily published by virtue of their content but were published and bought for the sake of the material book itself.</page><page sequence="5">Ambivalent Beginnings 303 turn of the century, we find the beginning of a long (and still) thriving tradition in Sweden of fine prints, artist books, as well as limited edi- tions-books of poetry forming a complementary circulation on the book market arising from their own material conditions. An important figure at the outset of this movement was the artist Arthur Sjögren (1874-1951) who illustrated and designed Strindberg's Ordalek och smàkonst. He was one of the major "book artists" at the time, who worked with a variety of books. The practice of having a person specifically in charge of the artistic design of the book was initiated in the late nineteenth century, and the word bokkonstnärwzs consequendy coined at this time.3 The book artist was thus a new function in the literary system taking part in defining what kind of object a literary work is. In 1903 Sjögren had his own collection published, Maskros (Dande- lion). This work is never mentioned in histories of Swedish literature though it displays some of the bibliographic trends that characterized the coming decades. It illustrates new emphasis put on the material expression of the book. Maskros is distinctive both as a reaction to the technological shifts in book production and as a product of these new conditions. Sjogren's poems are set in a highly decorated book, an illu- minated manuscript, and printed in a numbered edition. Illustrations and calligraphy were done by Sjogren's hand but reproduced by a fairly new printing technique, fototypi, a photographic method that facilitated reproduction of original images such as ink drawings and watercolor paintings. The work is full of romantic sentiment, melancholy, as well as celebrations of beauty. The effort spent on materials, layout, and images seems to highlight the book as an object of worship. The design is in some cases original, in other cases derivative. One poem is presented with a golden illuminated tide and initials in medieval style, an obvious influence from the book design of William Morris. What stands out in this book is not the poetry as such but precisely the book as a material object. Its material and pictorial style, thoroughly inspired by Jugendstil or art nouveau, emphasize that the book is an artisanal product much in line with Morris's ideas about the return to beauty of everyday goods such as books, minus the political implications of Morris's work; it is all about beauty, design, and the author's original signature. The poem "Döden gär- i skönhets spar" (Death Treads- In the Footsteps of Beauty) might suffice as an example. The poem is mate- 3. On the term bokkonst in Sweden, see Gram, Bokkonstnären 44-5.</page><page sequence="6">304 Scandinavian Studies rialized through the artisťs handwriting and illustrations that point to the craftsmanship and the artfulness of the poem, a great part of the message of beauty that the text conveys (fig. i). Although the book gives the impression of a bibliographic concept not poetically fulfilled, some of the poems like this one for example nevertheless exhibit self- reflection mirroring not only the author's personal condition but also that of the poem. "Skönhet du mask, / som vi älska att bära! / Dig, som vi sälja / och köpa och ära" (Sjögren) [Beauty, oh mask / that we love to wear! / to sell / and to buy and to honor]. It is apparendy a dangerous commodity: cc[ett] gyllene skal / omkring maskars bo55 [a golden shell / around worms] ; but the author still confesses: "Ändock- mitt öde bief / att dig hylla" [still- my destiny was / to pay you tribute], a comment referring to Sjögren not only as a poet but also as a book artist. Sjogren's work was highly innovative in the Swedish context although perhaps too poor poetically to be acknowledged. The debt to Jugendstil and art nouveau artists abroad is apparent. The English Pre-Raphaelite painter and illustrator Burne-Jones and the American art nouveau illustrator Will H. Bradley might be mentioned as possible sources of Figure i</page><page sequence="7">Ambivalent Beginnings 305 inspirations (Lagerström 20). It is probably most fair to consider the work primarily as an artist's book. What stands out in the work is not the melancholy verse, but its celebration of beauty, in particular the beautiful book. In the tradition of material modernism, the book is not only a "work of art," it is also a commodity, an object artfully made and intended to be bought on account of the aesthetic qualities of its design. So in that respect, this tradition implies a conventional understanding of beauty that we generally do not associate with modernism. The artisťs book is just one of many expressions of the new interest in original graphics and beautiful books. Indeed, Johanna Drucker has labeled the artisťs book " the quintessential 20th-century artform" (1), as it embodies many of the artistic ideals that marked modernism. Maskros meets a few of the criteria set up by Drucker: there is a self-consciousness about the book as a meaningful material artifact; there is no definitive hierarchy between images and text (they are integrated, but the images are no mere illustrations of the poems) ; and it plays on its air of authority or its "auratic" qualities (94) through the material presentation of the work. Only a small minority of poetry books produced in twentieth-century Sweden are artisťs books in a more restricted sense (i.e. books as works of art), but these exclusive artworks can be seen as indicative of a larger trend in the production of poetry books, and it is reasonable to empha- size the material form of the books more broadly and their value in a consumer culture. Industrialized book production led to cheaper books and books for the lower classes, but also a wave of deluxe editions: expensive cloth bindings with polychrome covers and golden letters, books that could fill the book shelves and embellish the homes of the growing new middle classes (Lundblad 186-247). The new interest in fine print can in this perspective also be seen as a way of supplying the book with greater value at a time when the book is devalued. What is considered worth more can also be considered more significant; the implications of this paradoxical development will soon be discussed in relation to Strindberg's Ordalek och smâkonst. Sjogren's collection presents itself (using Benjamin's well-known terms) as a work of art in an age of mechanical reproduction. Maskros functions as an "auratic" object, though printed in a fairly large edi- tion (500 copies). Sjogren's collection is thereby an extreme example of a general situation in modern book production. As demonstrated by Kristina Lundblad, the book market in the early 1900s is marked by a consumer culture of "mass individualism." Around the turn of the</page><page sequence="8">3o6 Scandinavian Studies century the publisher's bindings are produced so as to market the books as original expressions, sometimes even in different covers so that the consumer is given the choice between different colored cloth bindings, for example (Lundblad 180-5). One effect of the mass individualism of the time was the renaissance of print briefly introduced here. In the case of the poetry collection, the originality and authenticity of poetic expression came more or less to demand a material form that could carry these poetic ideals. As I have suggested, it is possible that the idea of the "auratic" work, the Arts and Crafts movement, and the greater emphasis on the material design of books around 1900 had effects on how authors, publishers, and consumers came to regard collections of poetry. Ordalek och smâkonst The efforts that were made to enhance the material design of Strindberg^ Ordalek och smâkonst testify to its social meaning, as does the fact that the visual form of the book often was highlighted as one of the main arguments in advertising. On the back cover of Strindberg's^# svenska öden (1906) Bonniers quotes reviews, all of which emphasize the dis- tinctive look of Strindberg's 1905 collection of poetry: "Arthur Sjögren har här âstadkommit nägot synnerligen originellt och artistiskt.... Det är en charmant bok, värd att läsas och se pa" [Here Arthur Sjögren has achieved something particularly original and artistic.... It is a charming book, well worth looking at] ; "Den typografiska och illustrativa utstyrsel, hvarmed Arthur Sjögren försett boken, är djärf, i ögonen fallande och originell55 [The typographic and illustrated form given the book by Arthur Sjögren is bold, conspicuous, and original]; "Hvad den typografiska utstyrseln beträffar, är denna bok ett litet unicum. -Arthur Sjögrens illustmtioner och vignetter, tryckta i fiera färger, täfla värdijjt med de Strindbergska dikterna. Detta, jämte det originella bandet gör boken tili ett alldeles egenartadt litet praktverk55 [With regard to the typographic form, this book is unique. Arthur Sjogren's illustrations and vignettes, printed in multicolor, can worthily compete with Strindberg's poems. This fact, as well as the original binding, makes this book a singularly magnificent work]. The review quotations demonstrate primarily what the publisher regarded as the book's potential market value to a growing bibliophilie interest in literature.</page><page sequence="9">Ambivalent Beginnings 30 7 The paratexts of Ordalek och smàkonst thus constitute an important part of this collection of poetry. The covers and the graphical design constituted the kind of work that the authors and the publisher wanted to present to the readers. As the back cover quotations from the reviews demonstrate from the publisher's standpoint, the artful materiality of the book itself was a unique selling point for the work. In effect, the exterior of the book gestures towards an alternative aesthetic order- that of the artist's book- emphasizing the work as an artist's object not only, or even primarily, a work by Strindberg. The book is covered in yellow- green linen cloth, which brings an immediate physicality to the work. The black and red cover illustration depicts a stylized nature scene: two white swans flying over the tops of spruce and birch trees. The tide - set in a modern Jugendstil typeface- is centered at the top, and the image is asymmetrically placed in the right-hand side just under it leaving an abundance of space underneath. The author's name is integrated in the frame of the image, as is the artist's signature. The back of the book contains no text or images. These thresholds are places of transaction where the reader is influenced by several layers of intentionality that frame the text: Strindberg's, Sjogren's, and Bonniers's as well as the more general socio-cultural meanings that constitute an author's name, for example, or conceptions of how illustrations are to be understood in relation to the text.4 In short, this book presents itself to the reader as a composite work of dual artistic motivations as well as a desirable modern commodity that would embellish the coffee table. The endpapers- front and back- display another stylized nature image, a night scene, a picture of a lake associated with the cover image. On the next page the reader finds a frontispiece, depicting a lute against the dark background of a forest. The main text is accordingly framed by several artistic manifestations prior to the tide page. Subsequendy there are two title leaves. On the first, we have the author's name and tide of the work on recto, and on verso we read: "Illustrerad och typo- grafiskt redigerad af Arthur Sjögren" [Illustrated and typographically edited by Arthur Sjögren]. According to Georg Svensson, this was the first time in Sweden that the artist responsible for the graphic design of a book was credited (100). There is thus a new authorial function inscribed into the work accentuating the elevated status of the book designer, but also the greater significance ascribed to the artistic form 4. 1 use the term paratext and the metaphor "thresholds" in Genette's sense.</page><page sequence="10">3o8 Scandinavian Studies of the book in the public domain. As in most books considered deluxe editions, there is a minimum of bibliographic information. There is no price (it was 8.50 kr, which was comparatively high), no information about the number of copies printed (it was a fairly large edition, 1,300 copies), and, of course, given that this book was to be regarded as a deluxe edition, there is no advertising for other books (see Ollfors 47). The transmission history of Ordalek och smãkonst is typical of many a collections of poetry during the modernist era. The poems exist in multiple versions, in pre- and post-publications in magazines, as part of poetry books from 1902 and 1903, in the collection in question from 1905, as well as in two later editions. Strindberg himself understood these poems as a whole and wanted them published together in a single volume; however, the publishers he approached were not interested. It was not until Sjögren came up with the idea of an illustrated deluxe edition that Bonniers agreed to publish them. Consequendy the book was born on the condition that it would be something more than just a collection of texts. Sjögren was given full responsibility for the entire design of the book although Strindberg was promised the last word. As indicated, Bonniers invested a large amount of money in the book. A new typeface was bought, and illustrations were printed in multicolor on fine antique paper. Strindberg's Ordalek och smakonst , like Sjogren's Maskros, is thus typi- cal of new bibliographic trends. Strindberg's work is also an exemplar since self-reflection and a modernist style of writing is embedded in the form of the book. The following argument will consider three aspects of the materiality of Strindberg's book of poetry: firsdy, Strindberg's ideas about typography and the material expression of the poetic text; secondly, Sjogren's illustrations and the correspondences with the visual language in Strindberg's texts; and thirdly, the matter of the value- monetary and aesthetic- of the deluxe edition, values about which Strindberg felt ambivalent. Strindberg's Blackletter Poems Strindberg considered the material face of the text an important part of the expression. He was anxious to give his manuscripts a carefully prepared design so as to complete the works by their material form (cf. Söderström 58-63). His illuminated tide pages and beautiful lettering</page><page sequence="11">Ambivalent Beginnings 309 turned the manuscripts into finished works connecting the work to the author and his creative labor. What is more, this aura thus installed in the artifacts made them desirable objects, a fact confirmed by Strindberg's habit of selling the manuscripts or giving them away as gifts. With regard to the print, he was similarly fastidious about the choice of typeface and layout, as this section of the article will illustrate. Generally Strindberg preferred sober typography (Gram, "August" 6). He was often involved in the making of the books and was in contact with the prominent printers of the time. Although he was opposed to advertisements on books as well as the free typographic style (with many new and mixed typefaces) that characterized the previous decades, he was well aware of the need for marketing and strategic thinking in publishing. Gram stresses two contemporary background issues in the design of his books. Firsdy the domestic scene and the printers behind the journal Nor disk boktryckarkonst touched upon above. The people behind this journal advocated a simple "Swedish" or "Nordic" design characterized by simplicity and a comprehensive plan for typography, page layout, and illustrations. Modern typography should thus be characterized by formal awareness, artistic integrity, and a rejection of the heterogeneous style of previous decades (e.g. many new and mixed types). No imported cliches were allowed. The fact that several of Strindberg's works were published as deluxe editions is explained by his associations with bib- liophiles like Hugo Lagerström and Arthur Sjögren, who were involved in Nordisk boktryckarkonst . Strindberg himself was not the force behind these books; rather, he often emphasized his preference for cheap edi- tions that could be bought by a large audience. But as indicated above, the intention behind these fine prints cannot be narrowed down to the writer-author. The German typographical reform movement around 1900 is the second background issue for the design of Strindberg's books. Under the label of Buchkunst, artists and printers advocated and strived for har- monious configurations of books. Many new typefaces were created, but the elaboration of traditional blackletter typefaces was also an influential feature (Gram, "August Strindberg" 8-15). Although Strindberg was very much in the hands of his printers and their bibliographic vision, he also advocated his particular artistic ideas for several of his works. One such feature was precisely his special predilection for old blackletter or Gothic typefaces as opposed to the standard roman types. Schwabacher, an early German typescript, was popular in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century</page><page sequence="12">3IO Scandinavian Studies Swedish books, such as the famous Gustav Vasa Bible. Strindberg wanted these blackletter typefaces in many tides and at the header of the book pages, but curiously, after the turn of the century, he also specifically wanted certain poems to be set in these blackletter faces. In his manuscripts, it is evident that these style choices coincide with the formation of the poems. For example, in the long hexameter poem "Trefaldighetsnatten" (Trinity Sunday Night), Strindberg makes a note to the printer in the manuscript that certain sections of the poem shall be set "i en vacker och läslig Fraktur eller Schwabach55 [in a beautiful and readable Fraktur or Schwabach].5 The long poem in question is divided into speeches and songs, the majority of them in hexameter. Strindberg singles out the piece "Chrysáětos" (Chrysaetos) - i.e. the poeťs gloomy song about love- as well as "Jag drömde55 (I Dreamed) and the nonsense poems "Flöjeln sjunger55 (The Weathervane Sings) and "Näktergalens sâng55 (The Song of the Nightingale). These poems- all in other metrical forms- differ from the narrative mode of the rest of the poem. These differences in design are at work in the major prepublications of Ordalek och smãkonst. A majority of the poems in Strindberg5s 1905 collection was published in 1902 in a collection of short stories, Fajjetvik och Skamsund. In this work one finds the subtle but also, for the time, radical typographical distinction between different stanzas in the "Tre- faldighetsnatten55 suite mentioned above. The Schwabacher type design creates two separate semiotic orders in the suite, open to interpretation (fig. 2). The choice of a second typeface apparendy points to the author's desire to install differences within the material design. The thickness of the selected poems with blackletter faces seems to correspond to the greater "thickness55 or aesthetic density of the poems. Consequendy there is a marked difference between the uncomplicated narrative modus of the parts of the suite set in roman types and the parts set in Schwabacher types, the latter typeface generally used for the songs ascribed to "Skalden55 [the poet] as well as the sound poems. In the 1903 prose book Ensam Ç Alone ), two poems are integrated in the narrative ("Ahasvérus55 ["Ahasuerus55] and "Vargarne tjuta55 ["The Wolves are Howling55]), and both are set in Fraktur, making a typographical distinction between poetry and prose. Mixtures of type- faces were a common feature at the time, not least in literary journals. 5. MS Strindberg Collection, SgNM 8:9, 5, pp. 14-5; cf. also 8:9, 6, pp. 10-1.</page><page sequence="13">Ambivalent Beginnings 311 Figure 2 However, in Strindberg's own writing, in the semi-autobiographical novel Ensam , we find a passage about typographic effects that in a general sense can be taken for a personal motivation behind his choice. Strindberg's narrator has grown accustomed to meditating and reading devotional literature. He compares the different sensations of reading a Bible from the seventeenth century and one from the eighteenth century: the same text but different books. The older one, a black cordovan leather book, printed in Schwabacher typeface, is described as having a tremendous power: it seems to have accumulated "hat och vrede" (36) ["hate and anger" (380)]. The eighteenth-century book has a calf binding and pressed letters in gold, the paper is lighter, the typeface is more joyful- 'vänder mest den vackra sidan till" (37) ["always presents its best side" (380)] according to the narrator. With his flair for modern metaphors, Strindberg compares these sacred books to storage batteries that can be charged by the faithful reader. In Ensam this passage is one of many instances of introspection: the</page><page sequence="14">312 Scandinavian Studies hero finds yet another proof of his sensitivity to signs and other stimuli in art, dreams, or in the behavior of other people (cf. Erik Johannes- son 218-20; Westin 178-9). In this case, there is an awareness of how the bibliographic codes contribute to the message the reader receives (McGann, Textual 56-62). The typeface and other graphical elements can create effects of estrangement in providing associations and energy to the reader. In the 1905 collection Ordalek och smàkonst a modern blackletter font is used: Neudeutsch. Sweden had traditionally acquired typefaces from abroad, in particular from Germany (Falk 123). This Gothic -Jugendstil bastard typeface was created by the German graphical artist Otto Hupp, whose artful typographical design in turn was inspired by the English Arts and Crafts movement (Falk 27-8, 132). As we see on these pages (see fig. 3), the nonsense poems in free verse are beautifully set in rela- tion to the illustrations, in contrast, one might add, to the hexameter stanzas that do not seem to fit in the frame. The typeface creates a gesture that points the reader to the text as an artifact, and the same gesture is evident in the nonsense or sound poems. At this time Gothic typefaces were rarely used, but rather Jugendstil typefaces in general commonly appeared in headlines, ads, and occasional prints. In his sound poems, Strindberg was interested in translating the sound into Figure 3</page><page sequence="15">Ambivalent Beginnings 313 words and metrical units; and alongside the "translation" Strindberg is working with a technique of free association. The sounds make him think of actual words that in turn lead to new associations, links of associations that often lead to drastic utterances, for example in the "Näktergalens sâng": "sa5, sa', sa', sa' na! / Ji, jih, guh, guh, guh, guh" leads up to "gu'hjälp" [God help me]. In more than one sense, the language becomes visible: the typography, page layout, white spaces, forms of spelling, and diacritical signs that are supposed to embody the sounds of the weathervane or the nightingale. Like the graphical language of the page, the nonsense poems do not transparently display the meaning of the poems. This trait of much modernist poetry makes a case for the fact that the meaning of poetry, in particular, lies in the textuality or the medium of the work. Unlike roman typefaces, which were standard at this time, the neo- Gothic letters create noise and a sense of difference. One can assume that this was something that Strindberg desired, but at the same time he acknowledged the deficiencies of these effects. In a letter to Bonniers, he states that the text is hard to read for common people ("smâfolket"), and he wants the publisher to publish a new, cheaper edition "med slāt latinstil, afsedd for mina fattiga vänner" (August Strindbergs brev 179) [with plain roman style, for my poor friends]. Illustrations: Images and Words Ordalek och smãkonst is a polyphonic work, populated with multiple voices, none of which has any natural priority over the other. Every poem in the collection is either illustrated or furnished with a vignette. Apart from a few artistically uneven images, the illustrations are fre- quendy assuming the visual language in Strindberg's text. Sometimes, by way of more independent approaches vis-à-vis the texts, they open new perspectives on the poems and vice versa.</page><page sequence="16">314 Scandinavian Studies The first page of the poem "Gatubilder" (Street Images) represents how text and images are graphically matched as a close correspondence between the two (fig. 4). In this famous poem, we have a description of a street in Stockholm at dawn: "Ödslig gatan i morgonskymning / Kryper, sträcker sig ut i fjärran" (9) ["The desolate street in morning twilight / creeps, stretches itself out in the distance" (Bellquist 126)]. In the six stanzas, the depiction of the dark, somber city is in the fore- ground and moves with close attention from the details on the street level through the city, up to the top of a church tower, and then in the last stanza down into a dark cellar where Strindberg depicts a dynamo, a "hemsk" (12) ["horrible" (129)] electric generator. Throughout the poem there is also a double projection of the "soul" of the city and the people living there are displayed. Sjogren's first illustration has extracted a few details from the description of the street (e.g. the lampposts, baker pretzels, and grocery-shop brushes), but primarily the image forms its own interpretation of the dark city landscape. So there are literally two "Street Images," two equal utterances, and both can be seen as an illustration of the other. From a rhetorical point of view, the first part of the poem seeks to awaken the city by animating it through a number of anthropomorphic tropes, almost in an expressionistic fashion. For example, the street Figure 4</page><page sequence="17">Ambivalent Beginnings 315 "kryper55 (Strindberg, Ordalek 9) ["creeps" (126)] and "stracker sig ut i fjärran" ["stretches itself out in the distance55], and "dar hänga skyarna over55 ["clouds hang above55]. In the fourth stanza a street sweeper is stirring up the dust so that "jord och himmel i molnen mötas55 ["earth and heaven meet in the clouds55]. As we see in the illustration, this image has been taken up, and there is a stick figure sweeping up a cloud of dust. Alongside the images picked up by Sjögren in his illustration, there is a more immediate kind of description pointing to details in the image of the street: Husens längor, grâbruna vöggar, lister, rännor, rächen, balkonger, bagarkrinpflor och kryddboborstar ; trottoarernas plansten som marginaler. The houses' rows, grey-brown walls, fillets, gutters, railings, balconies, baker pretzels and grocery-shop brushes; the sidewalks' flat stones as margins. Strindberg5s text shifts in mood; certain parts describe the world as if enumerating the details of an image and then refer to "the margins,55 which suggest a redefinition of the naturalistic description. The choice of words creates ambivalence : do they refer to the real world or a picture of the world? This ambiguity seems to expose certain characteristics of poetic language: in this case the book as a constructed object of words and images. In the words of McGann, we are thus brought to the scene of textuality (22-3). There is a link between the materiality of the book, its status as an artifact, and the character of the text itself.6 Other parts of the poem are marked by expressionistic images taken from modern life- the city or modern technology- like in the famous last stanza (see fig. 5) in which Strindberg describes the great generator situated in a cellar. This strange, "svart och hemsk55 ["black and horrible55 (129)] machine "mal ... ljus55 ["grinds light55] for the whole neighbor- hood.7 On a figurative level, one is reminded of the description of the 6. Bellquist relates the poetic technique in the poem to symbolism, but his vision is per- sonal and his language unique: "it is not a pictorial landscape deriving from the paintings of Watteau, but rather an animated, mythopoeic transformation of the objective scape of the city" (129; see also 125-31). 7. For various interpretations of this symbol, see Ollén 279-80; Gustafsson 22-4; Bel- lquist 129-30.</page><page sequence="18">316 Scandinavian Studies Figure 5</page><page sequence="19">Ambivalent Beginnings 317 old seventeenth-century Bible in Ensam , which is full of energy and "psykiska krafter" (37) ["psychic energies" (381)]. In his illustration, Sjögren has chosen to depict the effect and not the cause- not the dynamo but, literally, the light it creates, thereby stressing not the dark and complex machine underground, but the nervous energy it creates. We find another kind of poem-illustration relationship in "Maj pa Heden" (May in the Meadow). This poem was written 1902- as indicated under the tide- a reference to the turbulent May Day dem- onstration this year. In 1902 the struggle for universal suffrage and the eight-hour day had culminated in popular disturbance, and there was fear of an uprising. Strindberg's poem is written in forceful diction, imitating the demonstrators' choral speech and the rhythm of march music (Ollén 291-5). The four stanzas focus on dissimilar scenes marked by the tension between quietness/stillness on the one hand and clamor/ movement on the other: in the first the meadow scene, in the second the building of a red speaker's platform, in the third the soldiers making themselves ready for batde, and lasdy the demonstrators moving on: Skaror tága i rad! frantati Rödafanor de fóra! Utan vápen och utan stát Ingen mäktar dem skilja dt Ingen vagar de tyste röra ! Dã höras dar ord frãn talarebord Ej om brand eller mord; Blott om orätt och rätt! Rätt Vili vi ha! Ja! (28) (Crowds march in a row! Forward! They carry red banners! Without weapons, and without splendor No one has the power to divide them No one dares to touch the silent crowd Then words are heard From the speakers' stand Not about fire or murder; Only about injustice and justice! Justice! What we want! Yes!)</page><page sequence="20">3i8 Scandinavian Studies The huge procession is rendered in the main illustration (see fig. 6). However, it is pictured in the background, as if not at the center of attention. In the second stanza, carpenters are building a podium, painting it "rödt som blod" [red as blood]. It is compared to a scaffold, which the text lets us know does not portend well; and this implication seems to be what the stanza primarily wants to communicate: "Den är lik en schavott, / Den badar ej godt / Men star dar den stâtt / Bâdar den godt? / Säj! / Nej!" [It is like a scaffold, / It does not bode well / But it stands where it stands / Does it bode well? / Tell us! / No!] In the illustration, the empty red platform is placed in the forefront completely dominating the frame and covering up a large part of the crowd. The image does not convey the dynamic threat of the situa- tion; rather, it depicts a calm and almost idyllic scene. This mood is reinforced by the snail in the grass depicted on the right. Sjögren was inspired by the description of the podium but leaves out the carpen- ters, and the aesthetic pleasure of the picture lies in the dominating red color and the irregular lines of the podium, which all work well with the red frames of the page. The unexpected focus of the illustra- tion points to the fifth line in the second stanza, which at first sight appears to be unrelated to the main theme: "Rodt är grundfárg, den Figure 6</page><page sequence="21">Ambivalent Beginnings 319 syns och kläder" [Red is a primary color, it is eye-catching and becom- ing]. (When the subsequent line states "Den är lik en schavott" [it is like a scaffold], it does not refer to the red color in the preceding line but to the podium under construction.) Again, there is a reference in the text (although composed before the illustration was made, of course) that points to the picture and the dialogues between poem and illustration. The reference does not entirely make sense in the poem's narrative and fictional universe; rather, it points the reader to the text's and the illustration's- the book's- literal surfaces. The contrast between Sjogren's picture and Strindberg's poem highlights a tension that is already there in both text and illustration. The vignette on the right-hand side depicts a snail with a royal crown, which implies an ironic layer in the overall presentation of the poem. As metaphor the snail plays on the similarity between the slow proces- sion of demonstrators and the snail. As symbol it is often derogatory, and the connection to the crown is of course significant in the context of the poem: the demonstrators move slowly but inexorably, and they want democratic change. The snail moving along in the meadow grass, like the king and government, are in peril considering the marching crowd of demonstrators. The ornamentation and the images make the text more difficult to read; it adds a layer of meaning to the text, but not simply as an embel- lishment, even though the images has that function also. Above all they take the reader's attention back to the text and make him/her question the readability of the poem. The images consequendy cannot be reduced to any instrumental function normally attributed to illustrations. The snail is decoration, moving slowly in the margins of the text, but it also refers back to the poem, expanding and complicating the visible language of the text. In that sense the "thickness" of the material page is a radical form of material modernism. Valuation and Devaluation of Strindberg^ Material Modernism Literary works in the tradition of material modernism draw their value precisely from their material form. A limited edition reinforces its value through the scarcity of copies and the deluxe edition through the exclusivity of the paper, printing, and cover or through the name</page><page sequence="22">320 Scandinavian Studies of the book artist involved. Of course, how readers at times value or disregard literary works is indicative of the social meaning of art. Finally, I turn to the value of Ordakk och smãkonst and the value of the work as a book on the market. Strindberg's collection as noted was only published thanks to Sjogren's idea of a deluxe edition of the work; the value of the work- according to Bonniers- resided in its form as an artisťs book. As demonstrated by the advertisement for the work above, it is apparent that some of its significance for the consumer lay in its material form. Today, however- for critics, for scholarly edi- tors-its value lies in the text in a restricted sense. This collection has generally been seen as a text cut off from its bibliographic context. As to the transmission of the work, the original context has been ignored or disfigured. George Bornstein has demonstrated how the reception of modernism tends to dehistorize the works as they are rendered as immaterial instead of material texts (5-32). In the collected works of August Strindberg, Ordalek och smãkonst is represented as pure text, as if Strindberg's work arose in a historical void, and this critical edition is generally representative of how modern poetry is transmitted and interpreted (see Viklund, "August Strindbergs"). The exclusion in the collected works of Strindberg is also a devaluation of some of the aspects of the work that made it valuable at the time. When Strindberg entered negotiations with several publishers, he offered his collection of poems for free on condition that they were released quickly, but the offer met with no success. Some scholars have contended that this proves that Strindberg did not care much for poetry as opposed to drama (cf. Ollén 221). But the fact that he did not demand money does not mean that poetry, for Strindberg, had less worth. On the contrary, Strindberg put more value on the poems' reaching an audience than on realizing a profit. Strindberg was ambivalent towards a deluxe edition like this because he thought it was too expensive, a fact which in turn restricted the audience. He presented this problem to his publishers in several letters trying to convince them to publish a "fattigupplaga" [poor man's edition] of the poems, but it took Bonniers a good seven years- until 1912- soon after Strindberg's death to reprint the work in a cheaper edition (August Strindbergs brev 216-7, cf. also 178-9).</page><page sequence="23">Ambivalent Beginnings 321 Conclusion Ordalek och smâkonst makes us reconsider the boundaries of modernism. The deluxe edition points to many features that would characterize the tradition of the modernist book of poetry. By way of conclusion, one might comment on the tide of the work and how it reflects on the book. The word smâkonst (minor art) is in one sense a figure of modesty, and it reflects on the ambiguity with which Strindberg presented himself as a poet. But smâkonst also refers to visual culture of the time: with new printing technologies came an overwhelming number of images in advertising as well as in books. These were forms of embellishments but also features that, as for poetry, were integrated into the concep- tion of the poetry book. Our selective historiography tends to neglect Kleinkunst as part of the visual culture of the time, as Lena Johannesson has argued (27). This is also true of collections of poetry, which have a visual and a material culture of their own. This material culture, I have argued, is a central aspect of the poetry book. It forms a part of the textual condition of these objects and makes us as readers reflect on our reading practices- what we do when we read, and what we see- as well as the wider function of collections of poetry in our modern era.
