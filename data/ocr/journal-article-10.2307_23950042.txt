<plain_text><page sequence="1">382 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES THE RELIGION OF THE MANICHEES.1 It is easy to understand the value of the study of the great historical religions, and the importance of the study of the beliefs and customs of rudimentary peoples is ever more widely recognized; but between these two classes there lies a curious and difficult field which as yet has hardly come into its own. The Oriental cults against which Christianity had to contend, especially those which were felt to be more closely related to it and were naturally regarded as the more dangerous, have, however, a distinct value, in that they enable us to determine some at least of the true differentiae between a conquering and progressive religion and its unsuccessful rivals. As a rule it is possible to distin guish (a) those more familiar religious ideas and systems which, though they may not be our own, seem to fall within our mental horizon, and (i)(i) those which are found among rudimentary peoples and, though quite alien from modern thought, yet seem to possess a certain intelligibility and rationality, granted particular premisses. If the adult normally understands other adults, and if he feels that he can at least adequately understand child-thought, it is because there is a true genetic connexion between normal child and adult mentality. Similarly in the study of religions there appears to be a true genetic connexion between the ' child' stage and the more ' adult י stage of the history of religion. On the other hand, in these Oriental cults, the rivals of Christianity, the wholly intelligible and frequently commendable features only throw into stronger relief other features which wholly elude us : they can with diffi culty be interpreted, or the modern interpretation of them is often too bizarre to be useful; the concepts are not those of rudimentary or of modern folk; and they find no place in our ways of thought, although the cults are known to have attracted men and women of their day who were relatively not less intelligent than ourselves. These cults are of extreme interest because, however prominent they once were, they prove to have lain outside what one may call the curve of religious evolution; and they contribute uniquely to the problem of the place in the absolute "history of religion of a Christianity which sprang from the Old Testament and a world of Sumerian-Semitic-Egyptian thought. Accordingly Professor Burkitt's book on Manichaeism and the renewed interest in all these Oriental cults open up questions of more than merely academic or antiquarian significance, and this must be the excuse for so lengthy an introductory paragraph. 1 The Religion of the Manichees, by F. C. Burkitt. Donnellan Lectures for 1934 (Cambridge Press, 1925.)</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND STUDIES 383 Manichaeism has special claims to attention—its long career, the fact that it attracted, among others, the young Augustine (in whose writings Prof. Burkitt thinks he has found traces of it), its peculiarly evil reputa tion, and the readiness to identify it, even where, as in the case of the Albigensians, the identification is misleading. More recently, explora tion in Chinese Turkestan has recovered from Turfan many extremely interesting documents which illuminate the religion of the later Mani chees. They also illustrate an art which, as Prof. Burkitt points out, well deserves the attention of students of both art and religion; and Sir Thomas Arnold, in his Charlton Lecture, has lately been suggesting that the Manichees bridge the gulf of some six centuries which now sever Sasanian and later Persian art, and that they maintained the con tinuity of a tradition which Mohammedan antipathy to the representation of the human figure would otherwise have destroyed. Further, whatever be the true extent of the influence of Greece upon Buddhist art, Buddhist influence upon Persian Manichaeism is admitted; and Prof. Burkitt suggests that the Manichees probably helped to transmit Buddhist elements westwards, among them notably the popular story of Barlaam and Joasaph. A religion that persisted some ten centuries, and reached from Tur kestan to North Africa, must have undergone different developements in different localities and ages; and by reason of the imperfect character of our sources and their varying dates and tendencies, there are many difficult problems of the origin of Manichaeism and its indebtedness to other religions. Prof״ Burkitt's Donnellan Lectures present a general account of the main features with special reference to the Turkestan material and to the evidence from the Syrian writer Ephraim in the recent edition by the late C. W. Mitchell which he himself initiated and —owing to the sad loss in the war of that promising young scholar— completed. To this Syriac work and especially his introductory essay (vol. ii) reference must be made for fuller details; though it is only right to say that after one has compared the more technical literature, and, above all, Bevan's exhaustive and critical article in the Encyclopaedia of Religion of Religion and Ethics, these lectures, slight and merely popular though they may seem, have left out little or nothing of initial impor tance. And one may be permitted to add that there could not be a more thought-provoking—and more readable—sketch, and that the chief points are so sharpened that the lectures constitute a highly sug gestive contribution to our knowledge of the environment of Early Christianity. They also afford a further illustration of the value of that literature which Prof. Burkitt himself once described as 'practically nothing more than the contents of a very fine monastic library'. Manichaeism, as everybody now knows, rests on a theory of the</page><page sequence="3">384 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES cosmos. There were once two entirely distinct and self-contained realms, Light and Darkness. The Dark attacked the Light and carried off and swallowed up some part of it; but gradually the Light is being disgorged, and the consummation of all things will be the final severance of Light and Dark. Mani's religion is intended to accomplish this slow and painful process. It had not that cold intellectual detachment which could conceive of an undifferentiated whole subsequently divided into two opposing parts. The appeal is more immediately personal: we are a mixture of the Light and the Dark, and our salvation comes when we throw off the Dark, and the Light that is already in us is reunited with the primal and eternal Light. This is no ' anthropomorphic religion ', nor is it some ' natural philosophy'. The step ' from religion to philo sophy' has led to a religious philosophy; and, as might be expected on the analogy of similar systems elsewhere, Manichaeism was no social, tribal, or national religion, but that of select individuals, sects, and orders. The dualism itself is, of course, very familiar ; it takes us back to the old-time conflict of light and chaotic darkness in Babylonian mythology. The opposites are not worked out upon ethical lines as in Zoroastrianism, where the aim is not to restore the Light but to destroy the Evil; nor are they systematized as in the strange and highly elaborated dualism of the Chinese Yang and Yin, with its light-dark, heat-cold, male-female, and so forth. It is a particular example of pre scientific classification, the closer study of which is proving of consider able philosophical interest.1 Next, what is much more difficult to grasp, is the fundamental materialism or realism so alien from our ordinary contrasts of' spiritual' and ' materialBut instead of a fundamental monistic materialism we find a primary dualism with two opposed sorts of ' matter'. What we call 'spiritual' is only a finer kind of matter, just as in China the almost contemporary Wang Ch'ung (c. a. d. roo) distinguishes the coarse matter, Yin, of which man's body is made, from the vital and intelligent elements which are of the fiery nature of Yang, and treats both 'Heaven' and 'Earth' as material. In Jainism this sort of materialism is developed more thoroughly, and the nature of Mani chaean religion eludes one unless one has grasped the facts of this materialistic dualism. The Dark is something material—a substance; the good element, the Light, is the substance of the Sun and Moon, and Light mingled with Dark can be found in men, in organic life, and in such inorganic things as metals. The Supreme Power is wholly Light, and ' God' or the ' Divine Element' is to be regarded as substance rather than person (pp. 40, 49)—the ambiguity reminding us of that 1 e. g. Ε. Cassirer Die Begriffsform im myihtschen Denken, 1912.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND STUDIES 385 attending the precise meaning of the Mongolian Tengri and the cognate Tien. According to the Persian-speaking Manichees the supreme ruler of the realm of light is called Zervan, the Timeless, Eternal (p. Γ9). In later Zoroastrianism the Zervanite sect regarded him as the origin of all things, and the author of the good and evil beings Ormuzd and Ahriman. But this last statement is anathematized in the Manichaean ' Confession', although Ormuzd himself is accepted as the Primal Man (p. 50 sq.). That Time as an entity has an early origin has been argued by Mont gomery (Journ. of Β ibl. Lit., xliii 243 n. 1) who finds it, for example, in the Epistle of Mara (Cureton's Spic. Syr.); and when we learn that Theodore Theodore of Mopsuestia identified Zervan with Fate (Tyche), and that the first principle is 'Time or Space' (N.T. analogies are noted by Dobschiitz,Dobschiitz, Journ. of Bibl. Lit. xli 220 sqq.), we have to recognize, what has long been felt by the present writer, that semantics, and the investi gation of the varying connotations of religious terms, are indispensable for any scientific study of religion. The Manichee God has five 'dwellings': the Jewish Shekinah has been adopted, as also the Jewish kaddsh 'holy' (based on Isa. vi) and Amen.Amen. Although these may be among other instances of dependence upon Syrian Christendom (see pp. 92, 115), direct Jewish influence can hardly be ignored. It is α ρήοή probable that outside contemporary orthodox Judaism there were heretical Jewish philosophical and other systems, even as Prof. Burkitt himself holds that Mani's religion was fundamentally heretical Christian. The Shekinah as a ' dwelling' or attribute can be the abode or material manifestation of an attribute; and it is to be remembered that the Jewish Shekinah could be materialized as light or fire, and that in early Judaism ideas of a primal light ('or) are ' much mixed up with mystical teachings about God The five attributes in question are distinctively mental qualities : Sense, Reason, Thought, Imagination, Intention. They recall Ahura Mazda's Amesha Spentas, with the difference, inter alia, that the latter include such ideas as Right (conformity to order), Sovereignty, Humility, Im mortality, whereas the Manichaean qualities are specifically those of a sane and intelligent mind (pp. 19, 33). In either case speculation is concerned not with gods as functionaries assisting the head of the pantheon to rule the world, but with divine and human qualities; it is an early psychology, a step in the analysis of causation and activity which is fundamental in the history of religion and appears to have 1 J.

C c</page><page sequence="5">386 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES arisen over a large part of the old world about the middle of the first millennium B.C. The Manichaean identification of Light and Life is an old idea, long before set forth most strikingly in the short-lived solar monism of Amenhotep IV (Ikhnaton). Since Light is creative, a physical vehicle of the idea as a bodily emission is intelligible (p. 29). And since Light is already too much mingled with the Dark the true Manichee will refrain both from generating fresh life and from injuring or destroying what already contains it. There is no place in the cosmogony for the ordinary idea of ' begetting', and at the beginning things were simply 'called' into existence (p. 24). This particular activity one is tempted to associate with the divine attribute ' Imagination' mentioned above; and the Syriac term which, Prof. Burkitt observes,' generally seems to contain the notion of something freshly invented' (p. 33), might perhaps more usefully be rendered ' conception '.l The' calling ' finds a parallel in Mandaean, where the ' First Life' calls into existence his three helpers, and, though the idea is also biblical (Ephraim vol. ii p. cxxxiii n. 1), it may well go back to the opening of the old Baby Ionian cosmogony: ' Or ere the heaven above Was named and the firmament (?) below called by name . . .' In other respects, too, Mani's religion has points of contact with Mandaean and with old Babylonian lore; and it is appropriate to recall that his father had once been asso ciated with the sect of the Mughtasila (' those who practice ablutions'), a sect closely related to the Mandaeans. Light might be freed from its imprisonment in the Dark, but it must not be harmed.. This applies to animal life, though the ' Confession' denounces the feeding of evil animals. Here Prof. Burkitt with some hesitation sees a reference to dogs (pp. 56, 59); and, to be sure, there may be a polemic against Zoroastrianism, where the dog is an especially sacred animal. But since it is considered iniquitous to mix the Light elements (water, fire, light, and wind) with the foul earth (cf. p. 63), it is perhaps more probable that, as in Zoroastrianism, serpents, frogs, worms, ants, and other creeping things of the earth were specially abhorred. It may, in fact, be suggested that Earth as the antithesis of Life was an essential feature in the genesis of Manichaeism. The anxiety to refrain from killing or harming aught that contained Life is of course restricted to the animal and vegetable kingdom, though, strictly speaking, there is ,Light in metals, and among rudimentary peoples there is often a thoroughgoing belief in the life or soul that informs inanimate things (e.g. tin). Nor are the precautions carried to 1 In the Odes of Solomon xli 10, ' his wealth begat me and his heart's conception (or conceiving thought)the term is used synonymously with that so familiar in the shape of the Mandaean 'iithra.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 387 such lengths as in Jainism. In neither religion does the desire not to injure living creatures develope into the practice of humanity for its own sake; and in general, as Prof. Burkitt points out, י the sympathy of the Manichee was directed not towards men, but towards the Light imprisoned in men' (p. 60). Finally, since even to break bread may pain the Life that is in it (p. 23), the Elect Manichee has his bread prepared by disciples, and thoughtfully utters a prayer on behalf of those who by their sacrilegious treatment of the grain have obviously run serious risks. The Elect himself also apologizes before he eats, and he repudiates all responsibility for the criminal processes of winnowing and grinding, and of baking the cake in the oven (p. 45). This is in entire harmony with the widespread custom of propitiating game or of taking precautions before devouring the Life-giving and the Life-containing food.1 It illustrates the depth of the belief in a sacred י corn-spiritwhich, however, is far from confined to vegetation, but is one with the sacred Light, and holds a central place in Manichaean theology. Now the Elect contains to a far less degree than others the Dark-element, he is more nearly akin to the all-perfect Light, so that when the Light-elements in the food pass into his own pure body there is a particularly strong concentration of Light-substance. Prof. Burkitt observes that ,though he was for bidden to prepare his food himself, yet a sacramental, indeed an actual physical benefit accrued to the Universe through his eating it' (p. 47). That this interpretation of the Manichaean meal is justifiable may be conceded; it is in harmony with the cosmic character of the Light element which pervades to a higher degree all the Elect, and, in view of the significance of the idea for early theories of sacrifice and sacra ment, further evidence from Manichaean sources would be welcome. Before Mani there were other ' messengers' who possessed the Light to a supreme degree, e.g. Buddha, Zoroaster, Plato. There was also Hermes Trismegistus, and we have the luminous suggestion that con fusion of name possibly accounts for the fragments of the Shepherd of Hernias found at Turfan (p. 96). Among all 'messengers' Jesus was pre-eminent, and Mani called himself the ' Apostle of Jesus Christ'. In harmony with the Manichaean antipathy to generation, Jesus was human only in appearance (p. 40). To the African Faustus Jesus was the fruit ' hanging on every tree, produced by the energy and power of the air that makes the earth conceive', whence, he adds, ' our rever ence for everything is like that of you Catholic Christians about the Bread and the Cup' (p. 41 sq.). This, as Augustine saw, was to identify Jesus with the powers of vegetation and with the divine element in the Sun ; and, in fact, the Persian Manichees invoked Jesus as * among the 1 Cf. Frazer Taboo p. 190 sq.; Spirits of the Corn and Wild ii pp. 208 sqq. CC2</page><page sequence="7">398 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Gods first New Moon ... God and Full Moon ' (p. 92 sq.), and the two pure luminaries Sun and Moon were among the first portions of the Light-substance to be severed after the initial commingling of Light and Dark (p. 27). IVe find ourselves moving in a world more familiar, let us say, to readers of Frazer's Adonis, Attis and Osiris, a world of astral powers and processes, a world which seems—though only at first—to be utterly removed from Old Testament Messianism.1 Difficult though the ideas may be, if not at times a little repellent—so closely do they border on the magical, when they are not that already—such was the environment of Christianity. It was one which the student of biblical theology has to interrogate; and the O.T. and the N.T. fields overlap. Jesus is called the ζϊινάηά·, it is the term applied also to the five pure elements (pp. 24, 107 sq.). These are Light, Water, Wind, Fire—the ' earth' of Empedocles was naturally repudiated—and a fifth which the Syriac sources do not name, though other sources specify aer (Augustine) and νλη (Aria Arch). The Fihrist explicitly distinguishes four ' bodies' plus the fifth which is ' their spiritthe Zephyr (cf, Augustine)—in other words, the animating element. And since it is also possible to think, instead, of the common substance of the four, the term νλη. though rejected by scholars as a corruption of αήρ, may perhaps stand. Matter or essence or the animating spirit is the ultimate principle—precisely which it is depends on the point of view—and it is significant, therefore, that the Turkestan documents name two terms doubtfully rendered (a) substance or essence, and (ύ) life, living—' con ventionally rendered "aether"' (pp. 25, 107 sq.).2 Next, as regards the term ziwana (Joo-.)) which Prof. Burkitt regards as a Manichaean adaptation of a Middle Persian ziwandag ' living one', the Aramaic J a.·) can be traced back to the Assyrian ztmu face, appearance, bril liance (of Ishtar, kings, &amp;c.).3 It denotes the royal splendour of Nebuchadrezzar (Dan. iv 36 [33]), and can be illustrated by Ahikar's praise of the Egyptian pharaoh (Rendel Harris, 2nd ed., p. 118) or Ben Sira's glowing description of Simon the son of Onias (Ecclus. 50). In Jewish literature the term itself from an early date was closely associated with the Shekinah,* and just as the latter is used—and even more or less 1 The idea of the divine kingship is the connecting-link ; cf. the old semi-divine Pharaoh as the husband of the land and the cause of its fertility. 2 Besides being a problem of semantics it is also one of analysis and synthesis. An analysis into χ elements requires an additional unifying or logical term for a synthesis, just as the word ' Art' consists of three separate letters plus a parti cular arrangement. In Buddhist philosophy we find groups of six and of ten categories composed of five and of nine entities plus the unity of each group (Anesaki(Anesaki(Anesaki Nichiren, the Buddhist Philosopher, p. 154). So, also, for Bardaisan's six entities Ephraim speaks of seven ; and Burkitt gives reasons for the view that the seventh is Space (Ephr. ii cxxiii). 3 Muss-Arnolt, s.v. ; cf.

Glanz.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND STUDIES 389 physically—of the divine attributes, so the five zlwane in Turkestan have the curious name Five-God (Sacred Pentad), and are the origin, life, and essence of everything on earth (p. no). As such they are of the Light element, and we learn further that the ' Son of God' is invoked in the hymns as λαμττήρ, and that Augustine's Splenditenens suspends the world like a chandelier (p. 28). On these grounds, then, it seems much more probable that ziwdna means ' luminary' or the like (cf. Payne-Smith), and that the Persian word and meaning are secondary.1 The wide distribution and long career of Manichaeism will precjude any attempt to construct out of our imperfect sources any clear-cut and consistent system. And such are its many points of contact with its extensive environment that it may be precarious to build too much upon even the more striking parallels. To the Greek world it owed, directly or indirectly, the lampter, and also the bdlos, ' the clod' which the Dark will ultimately become when the Light (Life) has been entirely extracted. We have only to recall the prominence of Mother-cults, and especially the Mother-Earth idea—which Noldeke and others have recognized also in the Semitic area—to ask ourselves what, according to early thought, would the Life-giving earth become when utterly devoid of all that makes for life and growth. It would become cold, dead, lifeless, formless clods. Here, it may be conjectured, is the root of Manichaeism, which, on any view, contains much that is old; while, conversely, we are entitled to ask what became of the crude mythological and other ideas which at an earlier period had prevailed over the whole of. the old Oriental world. Some genetic relation between the earlier and the later mythologies and philosophies of Asia Minor and North Syria is only to be expected. Mani's polemic against ' the God of Marcion' (p. 86) and the attention he pays to the Bardesanians (p. 85) suggest that he was conscious of his agreement with, but more important divergence from, those whose teaching Ephraim considered that he had reproduced and perverted. Born at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, he would have come into touch with men of many י It can at least be safely inferred from Norberg,s lists that ziwii often occurs in the Mandaean Sidra Rabba although a hasty glance at Brandt and other writers has led to nothing. It may be added that in Ephr. ii cxxxvi η. 1 Prof. Burkitt cleverly connects the Syriac title of the Splenditenens (Jo-·) with the Assyrian sabatu to hold (it is used, e. g., of holding scales), the Jewish-Aram. ציבתא (tongs) being merely compared. Accordingly, ' Holder of the Brilliance ' is surely preferable to the suggestion in the Lectures (p. 2S n. 1) that the title means ' tongs of brilliance '. Ziwa and Shekinah belong to one and the same problem of old Oriental psychology, along with the Hebrew panim (face, presence), k&amp;bod (glory), the Egyptian ba (manifestation), ikh (glorified state), ka, &amp;c., &amp;c. Goldziher (Abhandl i )99 η. I) observes that the Persian for 'royal splendour', which can be equated with shekinah, could also have animal symbolism ; and the use of animal symbolism for the early Babylonian and Egyptian kings (especially the bull) is well known.</page><page sequence="9">39° THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES lands; and it is significant that he uses the literary Edessene Syriac and not a relatively restricted dialect as did the Mandaeans. He himself is said to have travelled as far east as China, and may well have known something of Indian and Chinese speculation.1 So striking a personality as our records make him out to be, he may be trusted to have impressed himself upon whatever ideas he owed to others, and Manichaeism as such ranks among the positive religions. But Manichaeism was essentially aristocratic and exclusive: the Elect, if not the ,salt of the earth', were on the way to becoming the ' light of the worldAs is well put: ' the deciding factor in the Last Day will be whether or no men and women have fed and clothed and succoured the Manichee Elect' (p. 90).2 There is no Divine Redeemer; no external helper in that intolerable struggle which rent Augustine; no Divine Love for the helpless individual. The divine light in man needed a transcendent power to kindle it, and Manichaeism did not reach beyond immanent deity in material form. There was no revolutionary change as when the Hinayana Buddhism, the religion of special individuals, developed into the Mahayana Buddhism, catholic in its embrace, and answered the needs of toiling, sinful humanity. Mani chaeism could not thus expand, and so it passed away. It was a perfect fusion of religion and the best speculative thought of the day. It had attractive features. It offered a religious and what was then a rational explanation of the Universe. It appealed to the religious emotion and the intellect. It was an inseparable blend of what was Religion and Science. It supplied a need which the Bible and Christianity failed to supply to those who sought a rational view of the Universe. Had it conquered its rival the fate of Christianity cannot be imagined. On the other hand, the relation between the two types of Buddhism suffices, by itself, to convince one that Manichaeism could never have been adapted, like Buddhism, to the religious needs of whole peoples. Nay more, it had a view of the Universe which not only could not have led to advance of knowledge but would have actually precluded the rise of science. Manichaeism was not socially unifying—its spiritual aristocracy was anti-social, and its ' science' excluded all further enquiry into the nature of things. Religion and Science could not be severed; they flourished and fell together. If the ideas were often daring, they were in some respects not more so than those in Christianity ; and the study of Manichaeism has the merit of emphasizing the dangerously close relation between Religion and Magic, and of shewing how Religion suffers most from what uncommonly resembles it but proves to be its worst enemy.
