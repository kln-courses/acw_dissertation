<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3Imperial Matter Between 1801 and the 1890s, the production and consumption of soap in Britain  increased exponentially, from barely 25,000 to as much as 260,000 tons per year.  Manufacture and marketing of this everyday substance developed into an imperial  commerce that pushed Victorian cleaning habits to the farthest colonized corners  of the globe, just as it brought images of empire into the most intimate spaces  of British homes (McClintock 1995: 209–210). In a wide-ranging study of gender,  race, and class in imperial Britain, Anne McClintock has shown how advertising  campaigns for the mass-produced Pears’ soap (figure 11) contributed to a larger  system of representation that unified the new commodity economy of nineteenth- century market capitalism under the “celebration of imperial spectacle” (1995:  219). Pears’ soap was one of several domestic things at the vanguard of this “com- modity spectacle,” playing a leading role in the drama of colonialism alongside  tobacco tins and whiskey bottles, biscuits and toothpaste, toffee boxes and bak- ing powder. To McClintock, in the hands of Britain’s advertisers and marketers,  everyday things became intermediaries for semiotic manipulations that allegori- cally displayed jingoistic messages of imperial success. Soap in particular served  as a “mediating form” (208) that embodied such middle-class values as monogamy  (“clean” sex), industrial capital (“clean” money), and the civilizing mission (clean- ing the savage). The industry surrounding this cheap and portable thing prospered  in part because “it could persuasively mediate the Victorian poetics of racial hy- giene and imperial progress” (209). McClintock’s telling of what she calls the “soap saga” has much to teach us about  the ways in which imperial agents harness the material world to further projects  of colonial rule. Her account is also, however, one that reduces imperial things  51 </page> <page sequence="2"> 52    Chapter Three Figure 11.

A parallel analysis of soap in late-nineteenth-century Britain casts this  mundane matter in a rather different guise. For Simon Schaffer (2008: 148), the  story of soap is a story of science, and of the “eloquent objects” of soap physics,  namely bubbles. To be sure, Shaffer also attends to soap’s commodification and the  combination of market forces that made it possible, from the accelerated produc- tion of alkali, to the extraction of palm oil and copra from colonial plantations in  West Africa and the South Pacific. But his main concern is the project of Britain’s  classical physicists to establish and communicate the underlying laws of mate- rial science through work and play with bubbles. Britain’s public scientists, intent  on demonstrating to receptive popular audiences the achievements of physics in  deriving general scientific principles pertaining to the structures of matter, looked  as closely as was then conceivably possible at suds themselves. These evanescent  things contributed to the development of microphysics, time-lapse photography,  and cinematography, as scientists worked to describe the properties of bubbles  (their dimensions, colors, formation, duration, oscillations, etc.) and to stabilize  them despite their inherent transience. </page> <page sequence="3"> Imperial Matter    53 I begin this chapter with these two contrasting stories of suds and spectacle in  late-nineteenth-century Britain because, examined side by side, they bring to the  fore the critical challenge that attends our understanding of the relation between  imperial power and things. The two studies nicely illustrate what Lorraine Daston  (2008: 16) has called the paradox of matter: “On the one side, there are the brute  intransigence of matter, everywhere and always the same, and the positivist his- toriography of facts that goes with it; on the other side, there are the plasticity of  meaning, bound to specific times and places, and the corresponding hermeneutic  historiography of culture.” McClintock and Schaffer bring this paradox into high relief. On the one hand,  following Marx on the mystique of the commodity fetish, McClintock (1995: 220)  addresses not the “brute intransigence” of the thing itself, or even its use value, but  only “its potency as a sign” that was open to manipulations of meanings tied to  imperialism and domesticity. Schaffer, on the other hand, is more concerned with  the sensible materiality of soap and the “positivist historiography of facts” that was  built around it, directing far less attention to its interpretation in a cultural sys- tem of value centered on the civilizing mission. McClintock (1995: 220) gives little  thought to humans’ tactile confrontation with the thing itself, instead forward- ing human contact with the abstraction of “commodity culture” embodied in the  advertisement. In contrast, Schaffer’s history leans in so closely to the encounter  of London scientists with soapy suds that the wider political context of global soap  consumption is lost. Finally, the two accounts also part ways when it comes to the capacities that  each accords to its nonhuman protagonists. To McClintock, it is not so much soap  that has an autonomous effect on the world, but the commodity form that it takes.  Soap is an “agent” in the civilizing mission only when it is “abstracted from social  context and human labor” (1995: 221–222). Schaffer’s bubbles are rather more pow- erful. Their very physical properties and the independent temporality of their lives  impel scientists to devise instruments to suspend their movement. It is these same  properties, according to Schaffer, that entice physicists and publics to apprehend  and appreciate the very laws of nature. When Schaffer speaks of soap bubbles  as “eloquent objects,” he picks up on Daston’s (2008: 12) idea that things do not  merely repeat the human voice, but themselves “press their messages” on us. They  too “have a say” (Olsen 2010: 31). How, then, are we to discover a working analytic for imperial things that con- joins in equal measure the force of both matter and meaning in shaping satrapal  conditions? How can archaeologies of empire discover the nodes of intersection  between the physical properties that things possess and impose on us, and the  politics in which we enlist them, individually and in assemblage? And how are  we to do this analytically, in a way that rises above the limitless multitudes of  things that abound in specific imperial times and places, while at the same time  </page> <page sequence="4"> 54    Chapter Three remaining beneath the soaring register of ontology, where the sociopolitical speci- ficity of things is lost to the cause of philosophical abstraction? This question mat- ters because things are not everywhere and always the same. It may be the case that  their abilities emerge in part from the inherent physical properties that allow them  to stand up to us, to make a difference in the world, to invite some kind of tactile  encounter, to conjure some kind of affective response, and to compel some kind  of dependence. But the forms of those encounters, the substance of those affects  and differences, and the strength of those dependencies arise from the particular  political and social constellations that humans and things together create. This is  not to suggest a social “a priori” into which things enter (Olsen 2010: 36–37), but to  accept that the collaborative work of humans and things can give rise to different  kinds of nonrandom associations. With five millennia of macropolitical power behind us, for example, students  of empire have come to understand that the relations between humans and things  recurrently produce a cluster of interlinked associations of coercion, violence,  extraction, compromise, affiliation, mimicry, complicity, and revolt, played out  across vast distances and across sundry social boundaries. Humanity’s role in this  bundle of associations that we have come to call imperialism is by now rather well  documented. But in this chapter I want to make the case that we have yet to think  concertedly about the collaborative capacities of nonsentient things in realizing  the conditions and conditionals of empire. Humans alone are not the sole protec- tors of effective imperial sovereignty, any more than they are independent actors  in their ambivalent attempts at bricolage or the determined exertions of dissent.  Such efforts are made possible, encouraged, and at times undermined or enforced  by decidedly nonhuman partners. Three steps lead us in this chapter to a conceptualization of the things that  work to produce satrapal conditions. The first section, by way of background, dis- tills a selection of key interventions in post-phenomenological and post-Marxist  philosophy, social theory, political theory, and archaeological thought that have  made it possible to recognize confederacies of things as efficacious participants in  social and political life. Several materialist perspectives emanating from a range  of scholarly locations that have come to constitute the “material turn” have care- fully diagnosed and contested the gradual exile of things from the humanistic and  social sciences—how it happened that language, reason, and culture eclipsed mat- ter, how we came to be so deeply distrustful and disdainful of things (Frow 2010;  Olsen 2010; A. T. Smith 2015). I shall not retread the philosophical historiography  that has long branded as “fetishistic” the supposedly misplaced gaze that rests too  long on putatively passive and inert stuff, instead of hastening to discover the pri- mary concerns that lie behind the “mere surface” of things (Olsen 2010: 25, 57, 64).  Even if not yet back from banishment, things are nevertheless slowly making their  return to philosophy and social theory. Thus, the question that I pose in the first  </page> <page sequence="5"> Imperial Matter    55 section of this chapter is: How are we coming to terms with them? How are philos- ophy, social theory, and archaeology conceptualizing their capacities, affordances,  and relations with humans? In this highly selective and abridged introduction to  material theory, my concern is less to explore the most fundamental questions of  the metaphysics of things (e.g. Harman 2002, 2010) than, rather more modestly,  to broadly synthesize the terms now on hand to describe what things are able to  do independent of the human-ascribed work of semiotic projection with which  archaeologists, as we saw in the previous chapter, are already well familiar. From this general background discussion of the material turn, I turn in the  next two sections to the crux of the matter: a diagnosis of the conspicuous lacunae  in material and colonial thought that has left us without an adequate account of  imperial things. Several recent political theories of matter have heterodoxically  asserted the determinative role of things in making political association possible.  But at the same time, these bodies of thought have arguably set the limits of the  political quite narrowly, in such a way as to exclude imperial polities from the  reach of their concepts. Conversely, anthropologies of colonialism have placed at  the center of their analyses precisely the unique relations of power that obtain in  imperial formations. Yet like McClintock’s soap saga, those historical ethnogra- phies that cast things prominently in the theater of colonialism tend to leave unre- solved Daston’s paradox, short-changing things in their abilities to shape imperial  projects, quite apart from the intentions of the humans who make them, use them,  and conscript them to the work of signification. To address these lacunae requires an analytic that is expressly centered on the  politics of matter in imperial formations. Such is the extended focus of the final  section of this chapter, which develops a schema for imperial things that pivots  around the four material concepts that I call delegates, proxies, captives, and affili- ates. As we shall see, each is distinctive for the different interventions of its con- stitutive matter in sociopolitical life, as well as for the nature of its relations to the  others and to human makers and users, from the most privileged imperial agents  to the subjugated whom they rule. Yet despite the varying ways in which delegates,  proxies, captives, and affiliates make and modify imperial projects, they emerge  analytically out of the well-founded postulate that virtually all things are bound  up in human–thing assemblages that make some sort of difference in the world.  Coming to grips with such capacities is a prerequisite for recognizing delegates,  proxies, captives, and affiliates as serious matters of empire. WHAT CAN THINGS DO? At the heart of most efforts to reclaim a place for things in the commotion of  existence is a withering critique of two intertwined orthodoxies: the distinction  and centrality of the human in philosophy and social theory, and the tyranny of  </page> <page sequence="6"> 56    Chapter Three semiotics that long rendered things inert and passive receptacles for the imprint  of culture and meaning. “Post-humanist” arguments that check the “long dictator- ship of human beings in philosophy” (Harman 2010: 2) and the “narcissistic reflex  of human language and thought” (Bennett 2010: xvi) have struggled to demolish  the long-cherished view that intention and cognition warrant a hierarchical figur- ing of humans and nonhumans in their capacities to make a difference in the world  (Harman 2002: 167). Things, these arguments hold, are not ontologically exhausted  by the representational qualities of signification that we assign to them. As Olsen  (2010: 10) aptly summarizes, things “do not just sit in silence waiting to be embod- ied with socially constructed meanings. Landscapes and things possess their own  unique qualities and competencies that they bring to our cohabitation with them.”  It is through these unique capacities for action and their intrinsic material prop- erties that things are able to commingle both productively and obstinately with  humans to generate the associations that we call polities and societies. Yet how are  we to characterize these actions? A highly abridged synthesis of four perspectives  drawn from contemporary social, political, and archaeological thought provides  a broad sense of both the emerging transdisciplinary consensus on the power of  things, and the range of ways in which that power can be conceived. “They have to be actors . . . and not simply the hapless bearers of symbolic pro- jection” writes Bruno Latour (2005b: 10) in his polemical introduction to actor– network theory, a framework that forcefully forwards the unqualified agency  of things in the associations that continuously gather together “the social.” The  key insight of actor–network theory is that social aggregates are not held up by  “social forces,” but endure because of a heterogeneous array of human and nonhu- man actors that continuously associate in impermanent networks. What allows  the various institutions that we conventionally understand as social or political  to obtain with any degree of endurance is our interactions with things of differ- ent durability, which lend a quality of stability or security to such associations,  without which the fleeting “social” could never be recognized as such, let alone  reproduced (Callon and Latour 1981; Latour 2005b). The actions of such nonhu- man things can be seen all around us: “kettles ‘boil’ water, knifes [sic] ‘cut’ meat,  baskets ‘hold’ provisions, hammers ‘hit’ nails on the head,” provided we accept  that action may be linked not to intention but to the ability to alter a given state  of affairs (Latour 2005b: 71). Things that make a difference are themselves actors,  participants, or “actants,” which describes “any entity that modifies another entity  in a trial” (Latour 2004: 237). In their capacities as actors, things can “authorize,  allow, afford, encourage, permit, suggest, influence, block, render possible, forbid,  and so on” (Latour 2005b: 72). Not all things are equal in their agentive possibili- ties, being efficacious to different degrees. Nor are they fully autonomous, because  every acting thing mobilizes a number of other things in its efforts. But agency  is dispersed across the full range of entities that differentially intervene in the  </page> <page sequence="7"> Imperial Matter    57 world (see also Gell 1998). Latour unequivocally divests agency of its traditional  associations with human motivation, stripping it down to the most basic capacity  to produce effects. It is a justifiable redefinition since, as others have noted, even  cognitive capacities for symbolism and self-awareness, insofar as they inescap- ably emerge from human corporeality, are themselves “indelibly material in their  provenance” (Coole and Frost 2010: 21), and thus provide something less than a  primary, determinative basis for the allocation of agency. Yet Latour’s democratic  redistribution of what has long been regarded as the human being’s most singu- larly distinctive quality, however expressly redefined, might still sit uncomfortably  with those concerned to avoid any whiff of anthropomorphism in our efforts to  make sense of nonhuman things on their own terms (e.g. A. T. Smith 2015). As we saw in chapter 2, Latour also draws an important distinction between a  thing as a mediator and as an intermediary. An intermediary does nothing more  than convey or transport meaning without causing any change (2000: 18). It is a  messenger that reflects, represents, expresses, or projects already existing mean- ing: “Defining its inputs is enough to define its outputs” (Latour 2005b: 39). Inter- mediaries are the stuff of “material culture,” collections of things whose actions  and influences amount to little more than the passive projection of society (84–85).  Mediators, in contrast, do not singularly signify meanings assigned to them, but  instead cause transformation: “Their input is never a good predictor of their out- put.  .  .  . Mediators transform, translate, distort, and modify the meaning [of]  the elements they are supposed to carry” (39). Reassembling the social requires  bringing mediators out of the shadows and not mistaking them for mere faith- ful intermediaries. Intermediaries are rare exceptions in a world brimming with  mediators. Mediators do not only symbolize relations, like “humble servants . . .  on the margins of the social” (73), but productively generate social action. Things  exist in at least these two modes, though more often as mediators. The challenge  is to discern them (79–82). Latour’s formulations have reverberated across many fields in the humanis- tic social sciences and beyond, from archaeology (e.g. Knappett 2008; Webmoor  2007; Witmore 2007) to political theory (Bennett 2010). For Jane Bennett (2010:  viii), materials enjoy a quality of “vitality,” which refers to “the capacity of things— edibles, commodities, storms, metals—not only to impede or block the will and  designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, pro- pensities, or tendencies of their own.” These active powers of nonsubjects are  intrinsic to matter itself, and not acquired through an external force that comes to  inhabit any given body. Echoing and building on Latour, Bennett speaks of mate- rial agency, the effectivity of nonhumans, and most especially, of “thing power”— the tendencies of matter to persist, to issue calls, to provoke affects, to act, and to  produce effects (2–6). Thing power is “an efficacy of objects in excess of the human  meanings, designs, or purposes they express or serve” (20). In suppressing the  </page> <page sequence="8"> 58    Chapter Three determinative weight of human design, Bennett means not to deny the existence  of intention, but to view it as “less definitive of outcomes” (32). Thing power stems  from a vitality, a kind of life, that is inherent in all matter, and is marked by a pro- pensity of things to “actively endeavor to express themselves” and their emergent  qualities, which external forces like human artisans can only bring forward, but  not endow (56; see also Ingold 2007: 12, and below). Importantly, Bennett speaks  of things rather than objects, for the latter are in her view only partial things, inso- far as they are products of human semiotics whose intrinsic existence is thus less  than fully realized. Or, in Bill Brown’s (2001: 4) words, an object is what we look  through to see what it reveals about society, culture, and most of all about us, while  a thing (at least in its nonambiguous sense) confronts us with its very own material  presence. Like Latour, Bennett (2010: 5, 10) holds that objects ought to be philo- sophically forgotten, replaced instead by “actants” in all their thing power. Yet thing power on its own is insufficient for grasping the agency of the material  world, because it suggests an overly fixed and atomistic order of things. Following  Deleuze (and earlier, Spinoza), Bennett (2010: 21, 23) insists that agency resides not in  individual things, but in the “agentic assemblage” of ontologically diverse and vibrant  entities that come together in ad hoc groupings. Things have a tendency to “conglom- erate,” to collaborate, to act in “confederations” of humans and nonhumans, which  demands a “congregational understanding of agency” (xvii, 20–21, 23). In assem- blages, effects result not from root causes residing in a subject, but in the vast “swarm  of vitalities at play” (32). This emphasis on the tangle of the assemblage has been  taken up and rethought by others concerned to move beyond the singular object to  the coalescence of multiple thingly components (A. T. Smith 2015). Like Latour, Bennett explodes the distinction between life and matter. In appre- hending a kind of vitality in “inanimate” things she trespasses a most sacrosanct  boundary of post-Enlightenment metaphysics. It is in much the same vein that  Lorraine Daston radically redistributes the capacity for speech among organic  and inorganic beings. To Daston, in their own nonverbal way, things can be said  to talk. They do not only ventriloquize or project human speech, but themselves  “press their messages on attentive auditors” (2008: 12). Daston works to check the  “narcissism” of Cartesian anthropocentrism, which “asserts a monopoly on lan- guage for human beings” and “condemns things merely to echo what people say”  (11). Things do not merely repeat. By virtue of their inherent material properties  as well as their cultural significance, they have their own say. These ideas finds  echoes in Walter Benjamin’s (1996: 73, quoted in Olsen 2010: 2096) interest in “the  material community of things in their communication,” which makes it possible  to attend to the ways things express themselves. Much like spoken speech, things  talk by conjuring certain “ways of thinking, feeling, and acting” (Daston 2008: 20). In contrast to Latour and Bennett, Daston here crosses over from a literal to  a metaphorical analytic for things. When Latour and Bennett speak of material  </page> <page sequence="9"> Imperial Matter    59 agency, they do not mean that things are active in a manner akin to humans, but  that they manifest their own forms of action and livelihood. It is more difficult to  get away from a metaphorical understanding of thingly loquaciousness (without  doing considerable violence to the meaning of the word “talk”), and to look past  Daston’s flirtation with an anthropomorphizing of things, their colonization under  the overbearing weight of the humanist discursive trope. But we can nevertheless  observe across these thinkers a shared project to dismantle the old certainty that  “subject” and “object” exist in stark opposition, and “acknowledge things not as  a backdrop to, or embodiment of, remnants of societies and cultures, but as an  inseparable part of their very constitution” (Olsen 2010: 149). Social theory has thus largely propelled the “turn to things.” And yet, as some  archaeologists and anthropologists have been quick to note (e.g. Hodder 2012;  Ingold 2007; Olsen 2010), ironically these bodies of thought have in many cases  maintained a remove from actual things in themselves, rarely pausing long enough  to undertake a sustained and serious examination of any particular thing—its  material properties, intrinsic capabilities, and what Hodder calls “entanglements.”  As the discipline with the deepest expertise in the points of encounter between  humans and things, archaeology has entered the conversation on matter in some  instances with an eye to “theoretical repatriation, that is, reclaiming a concept”  that has long occupied the center of the field’s theories and methods (Olsen 2010:  152; but see Fowles in Alberti et al. 2011: 898).For Ian Hodder, a new way of think- ing about things entails not necessarily a redistribution of agency, but a turn to  how thingly and human existence evolves out of deeply mutual and multifaceted  entanglements with one another. At the heart of Hodder’s theory is the concept of  dependence. Humans depend on things because they enable our existence through  their affordances, and at the same time as we rely on them to secure life’s routines,  they can constrain us in less than productive ways (dependency—Hodder 2012:  17–18). Our existence as humans is irreducibly “thingly” (38). Yet at the same time  as we rely on things, things rely on each other. “Things assemble” (8). They are  connected, entwined with one another and engaged in collective work in a manner  perhaps akin to Bennett’s assemblage. Things also rely on humans. If we want them  to persist in a particular state of being that is important to us, we must accord them  our care, for things can break down if left unattended, given their own nonhuman  temporalities. This dependence of things on humans “draws humans deeper into  the orbit of things” and imposes on us a “double bind, depending on things that  depend on humans” (Hodder 2012: 86, 88). It is this mutual, dialectical entrap- ment that Hodder means when he speaks of an “entanglement” between humans  and things. In an important departure from Latour and others, Hodder main- tains that to understand such entanglements requires a very close look at things in  themselves, their physical properties and the “non-human ecologies in which they  interact,” as well as their fluctuating hold over humans (93–94). Hodder calls for  </page> <page sequence="10"> 60    Chapter Three a shift in focus from “how things make society possible to the thing in itself ” (3),  yet this cannot be realized if the social dominates our approaches to things, and if  the boundaries between humans and things are relentlessly effaced to make way  for dispersed networks of undifferentiated actants. Entanglements are physically  as well as socially constructed, and archaeology is particularly well positioned to  probe their relatively neglected former dimension (95). These and other invitations to realize the existential autonomy of things, the  compass of their abilities, and the tangles in which they and we are ensnarled,  exhort us to utterly recondition both our innate sense and our analytical stance on  the very nature of existence. They provide the primal resources of the new mate- rialisms, the philosophical grist for deliberating their first principles and forward  bearings. Yet there is also a quality of relative tranquility in the atmospheres of  being that they call up, auras of thought that are free of struggle or contestation  over the proper distributions of energies and effects. How, in other words, do such  tranquil ontologies hold up against the agitations of political life? THE POLITICS OF THINGS It is perhaps a mark of a second wave in the material turn that things appear  increasingly inseparable from matters of politics, forcing yet another recondition- ing, this time of political philosophy. As “the victim of a strong object-avoidance  tendency” (Latour 2005a: 15), traditions of political thought from Hobbes to  Habermas have long written things out of the body politic, where only human par- ticipants assemble, authorize, and speak (see also A. T. Smith 2015). Yet in response  to calls for a post-humanist political theory that addresses the material constitu- tion of political association, things are increasingly being recast from outcasts to  participants in the political arena. Such a turn to take seriously the “stuff” of poli- tics (Braun and Whatmore 2010a: ix) would seem to open productive inroads into  rethinking the matter of imperial formations. And yet, as we shall see, there is an  emerging tendency to narrowly circumscribe the scope of either the material or  the political in attempting to define the relations between them. The result is that  recent materialist political thought, while offering critical insights on the thingly  qualities of our political lives, nevertheless offers insufficient analytic purchase on  the distinctive operations of materials caught up in the undemocratic politics of  imperial formations. For example, to some critical thinkers of the “new materialism” the politics of  matter is quite exclusively a politics of the body. We learn from Coole and Frost  (2010: 15–24), for instance, that the revolution in biomedicine and biotechnol- ogy has denormalized received wisdom on the proper subject of political action  and the just locations of political culpability. They note that the deleterious health  effects of environmental toxins raise new questions about how processes that  </page> <page sequence="11"> Imperial Matter    61 impact the materiality of the body have consequential policy implications. Our  bodily encounters with fertility and marriage, epidemics and food hygiene are the  realization of state intervention (23). One limitation of this concern with “bioma- terialism” is its exclusive focus on the body as the material site of the political (19),  to the radical exclusion of the vast world of nonbiological matter that brings bod- ies into being. Such a politics that is centered wholly on the body, even in its most  visceral, corporeal mode, appears rather less “post-humanist” than the “new mate- rialisms,” as Coole and Frost understand them, would seem to otherwise endorse. Other renegade strands of political thought, which have allowed for a more  capacious universe of material participants in public affairs, simultaneously  advance a rather constricted sense of the political. Latour (2005a: 16), for example,  calls for an “object-oriented democracy” that is alert to the long-neglected res of  the res publica, or the “things” of the public. He puts into play an expansive world  of things that moves far beyond the clearly delineated matter of traditional object  ontology. The things of Latour’s “Dingpolitik“ range from the objects of the assem- bly and the instruments of a parliament, to the “matters-of-concern” that divide  a public and the evidence that can settle or sharpen them. Such things join in a  participatory public sphere that assembles humans and nonhumans “in hybrid  forums and agoras”—the physical, institutional, and virtual arenas that are able to  bring to life gatherings of various sorts (23). Of concern here is a sense of politics  inextricably tied to the public assembly. Yet, as Latour and Weibel (2005: 47) themselves note, this kind of politics is one  that “entire empires have survived without.” It is the politics of democracy in places  like modern and contemporary Europe and America, where political representa- tion is a “Western obsession” (Latour 2005a: 34). For Latour the only apparent  alternative is the rejection of politics itself, which to him is equivalent to the rejec- tion of political assembly. Such objections can be detected far and wide beyond  the Western world, from the traditions of the Jivaros and Jihadists, to China and  Japan. Can these traditions count as political traditions, Latour skeptically asks  (35)? “Can we enlarge our definition of politics to the point where it accepts its  own suspension?” Yet perhaps the more immediate question to ask is whether  we should accept a definition of Dingpolitik that applies only to what Latour him- self reckons to be a mere “fraction of humanity.” In millennial terms, compared  to democracy, imperialism has been the far more enduring form of association  in humanity’s (and indeed Europe’s) political repertoires (Burbank and Cooper  2010), a coercive approach to aggregation that is premised not only on the rejec- tion of assembly but on the denial of the very option to those thus amassed. Yet  Dingpolitik admits of no such thing as the res imperia. Latour is not alone in locating the matter of the political in the res of the res  publica. In Bennett’s telling too, “vibrant matter” appears to exist exclusively in the  public sphere of the democracy. The capacities of nonhumans for political activity  </page> <page sequence="12"> 62    Chapter Three require our heightened attention only, it would seem, in the production of the  pluralist demos (2010: 30). Bennett draws on the theories of democracy advanced  by philosophers John Dewey and Jacques Rancière to locate the political material- ity of things in their role as members of a public. Her appropriation of Dewey’s  formulations suffices to demonstrate the politically constricted pertinence of her  vitalist materiality. In The Public and Its Problems, Dewey defines a public as one of many coex- isting, contingent, and temporary collectivities that arise in response to a shared  experience of a harm that eventually turns into a problem (see Bennett 2010: 100).  Such problems are the result of what Dewey calls “conjoint action,” which involves  initiatives undertaken alongside a swarm of countless other actions in a crowded  field of human endeavor and consequence. Indeed, this constant fluxing of simul- taneous acts and consequences that limits the possibility for full control is what,  for Dewey, makes a political system akin to an ecology. As in a natural ecosys- tem, the inescapable interactions of overlapping initiatives mean that no conjoint  action can be fully controlled by plans and intentions. Thus, in Dewey’s theory,  publics arise not out of will but out of consequences. While Dewey himself rec- ognizes only human origins for these actions, it is in his focus on outcomes over  intentions that Bennett sees the opportunity to admit all material bodies as mem- bers of a public. Publics of human and nonhuman members coalesce around the  need to tend to a shared problem that results from conjoint action. I have described Dewey’s idea of a public because it provides one window onto  the difficulty of extending Bennett’s (2010: 106) “materialist theory of democracy”  to contexts of macropolitical dominion. To make the case, let us continue with  Bennett and Dewey’s metaphor of the ecosystem. Imperial polities are made up  of such staggering “ecological diversity” (which is to say, diversity of political sys- tems) that it is impossible for a mass of humans and nonhumans existing in dif- ferent ecosystems to be affected by, and respond to, a common harm. We may of  course conceive of multiple publics within empires, just as Dewey allows for mul- tiple publics within democracies. But the multiple publics of a democracy emerge  out of a shared ecology and the conjoint actions of its multitudes. So while it might  be possible to speak of the multiple publics in an empire, there can be no “imperial  public.” And to the extent that, for Bennett, political actions of nonhumans are  effected through their participation in a public, we are once again left with no way  to think about the actions of nonhumans in the production and reproduction of  imperial sovereignty. Perhaps the most developed alternative to date to a materialist theory of demo- cratic politics hails from archaeology. In his “object-aware account of sovereignty,”  Adam T. Smith (2015) seeks to reground the polity writ large “in the machinery of  sovereign reproduction.” For Smith, the political machine invokes the “logics of  material assemblages in addition to . . . the agency of humans” that together drive  </page> <page sequence="13"> Imperial Matter    63 sociohistorical transformation. The conditions for such reproduction are three: a  coherent public (in this case a human collective) defined by relations of inclusion  and exclusion, the figure of a sovereign (or total sovereign establishment), and an  apparatus capable of formalizing governance. All three of these conditions are mate- rially produced through encounters of human-and-thing assemblies—encounters  that are grounded in the material workings of “sense” (which concerns the evoca- tive work of things), “sensibility” (which relates to the physicality of things), and  “sentiment” (which pertains to the imagined capacities of things). There is no tele- ology underlying Smith’s theory of sovereignty; but at least the first of his three  conditions—a cohesive public—is quite clearly a precondition for the other two. Smith provides a tight and elegant political theory of sovereignty as it obtains in  the relatively small and nascent polities of prehistory (the focus of his case study)  and, presumably, the nation-states of today. And yet the compelling suite of con- cepts in Political Machine are imperfectly suited to making sense of the political  matter of empire. To the extent that Smith’s three conditions obtain through accre- tion, he provides a robust analytical armature for tracing the work of things in  the incipient formation of sovereignty within a relatively cohesive and emergent  political community. Yet his emphasis on the necessity of a “coherent public” effec- tively excludes imperial polities from his theory of sovereignty. As we have already  seen, there can be no cohesive “imperial public,” no matter how efficacious is the  world of matter in creating encounters of sense, sensibility, and sentiment. Smith  leaves to others the question of the formation and reproduction of sovereignty  when instantiated in an aggrandizing modality that inherently refuses the pos- sibility of “a” public. Traditionally, as Jennifer Pitts (2010: 212) has noted, “political theory has come  slowly and late to the study of empire,” and early signs suggest a similar inattention  in its new materialist orientation. Latour, Bennett, Coole and Frost, Smith, and  others certainly make it possible to imagine a kind of analysis that allows room  for nonhumans as efficacious participants in the political affairs of imperial mac- ropolities (see also Bennett and Joyce 2010; Braun and Whatmore 2010a: ix). But  when it comes to rethinking in detail the work of political matter in the layered  sovereignties of empires, these important perspectives provide inspiration more  than an analytic schema. Political association is not exhausted by Western human- ity’s democratic projects, nor by other small-scale political projects grounded in  the materially mediated relations between a contained public and a sovereign. The  view of politics as a question of assembling is one shared by only a small slice of  humanity. A “more fully materialist theory of politics” that recognizes the powers  of nonhumans in political affairs (Braun and Whatmore 2010b: x) is perhaps best  reformulated in the plural, to allow for multiple theories of the political that can  account for the different ways in which humans and things come into association  under different constellations of power. </page> <page sequence="14"> 64    Chapter Three COLONIALISM AND THE MEANING OF THINGS If materialist political theories take us only part of the way toward a conceptual  reckoning with imperial matter, can materialist theories of colonialism bring us  any closer? While thus far the new materialisms have largely assumed the rep- resentational democracies of the present as their historical laboratory, their  twentieth-century precursor, materiality studies, often centered precisely on the  human–object encounters wrought by the nexus of European imperialism and  colonial capitalism. It would therefore be a mistake to suggest that a concerted  interest in the matter of empire is somehow new. In the 1990s, the meaning of  things occupied a prominent place in several seminal historical anthropologies of  colonialism, providing a critically important foundation for the present inquiry.  And yet, as we shall see, these foundational efforts also left unresolved the problem  of matter itself, the physical properties of things and their capacities to transform  human users. A close look at three influential accounts suffices to acknowledge the  important precursors to Imperial Matter, as well as to press the case that anthro- pologies of colonialism have taken the things of empire quite seriously, and at the  same time not quite seriously enough. One of the earliest extended efforts to contend expressly with the materiality  of colonialism was Nicholas Thomas’s Entangled Objects (1991), which afforded a  penetrating view onto the ensnarement of things in regimes of exchange and com- modification (see also Mintz 1985). Thomas’s concern was to direct anthropology’s  attention concretely toward “the variety of liaisons men and women have with  things in the conflicted, transhistorical history of colonialism” and away from the  “abstracted domain of man, subject, and object” (1991: 26) that had preoccupied  the revitalized material culture studies of the 1980s (Miller 1987). To Thomas, the  diverse liaisons of humans and things involved mutual appropriations and cross- ing currents of two-way traffic. For example, in the nineteenth century, European  commodities infiltrated indigenous societies of the Pacific islands, while indig- enous objects found their way into the private and public collections of European  travelers and institutions. What held Thomas’s attention were the encounters with  the unfamiliar entailed in these exchanges, and the incorporation of the exotic  into new regimes of value. On the European side, collecting practices exposed the  ambiguity of curiosity that surrounded European interests in, and apprehension  of, indigenous artifacts and their makers. On distant colonial shores, the responses  of Pacific islanders to the European objects brought by traders—iron axes, hatch- ets, muskets, gunpowder, whale teeth—revealed the ways in which a desire to  acquire such goods arose not from “the irresistible magnetism of white commodi- ties” (Thomas 1991: 87) but out of local political and cultural agendas. Thomas’s work introduces a style of engagement with objects that is common to  the anthropology of colonialism: one that privileges meaning and its malleability  </page> <page sequence="15"> Imperial Matter    65 over matter and its physicality (Daston 2008: 17). Like McClintock’s study of soap  and commodity spectacle in the British Empire, Thomas is quite deliberate in his  inattention to the brute and durable physicality of things. His central purpose is  precisely to counter the notion that a thing has a stable identity in its “fixed and  founded material form,” focusing instead on how “objects change in defiance of  their material stability” (1991: 4, 125). Even so, despite their apparent prominence,  it is fair to say that the things of Thomas’s study are largely epiphenomenal. That is,  indigenous objects matter only to the degree that their acquisition and representa- tion illuminate the sentiments and ethnological inclinations of the explorers, mis- sionaries, and settlers who collected them. For Thomas, the objects-turned-curios  and artifacts are the passive casualties of colonialism, not quite accorded powers  of their own to transform, but instead subject to the dispositions and desires of  acquisitive colonizers. Powerless, too, are the European objects that enter indig- enous worlds, which figure in Thomas’s story only to illuminate their appropria- tion and recontextualization in Pacific exchange regimes. When Thomas writes  evocatively of the “promiscuity of objects,” (27) or of their inherent “mutability”  (88), he is not referring to their own capacities for unpredictability, in a man- ner akin to Latour’s “mediators.” What mutate as objects cross cultural regimes  are, rather, the values and meanings that human agents ascribe to them, and their  standing in relations of exchange, variously as commodities, gifts, or prestige valu- ables. It is this act of crossing, “the movement and displacement of competing  conceptions of things,” that concerns Thomas, more than the things themselves  (123). Thomas’s “entangled objects” are thus ensnared not in immediate, human– object dependencies, but in the abstract transactional relations between givers  and receivers. These are metaphorical entanglements of culture and meaning, of  Western and non-Western peoples, in which objects are inextricably if collater- ally swept up. As Hodder (2012: 90) notes, what is missing from Thomas’s study  is “an adequate engagement with the object nature of things. The focus is on rela- tionships between people, how things connect opposed categories and allow for  hybridity and transformation.”1 Though foundational, Entangled Objects provides only a partial springboard  toward the satrapal condition also because of Thomas’s conspicuous silence on  power. A contrasting yet complementary case is to be found in John and Jean  Comaroff ’s (1997) telling of the nineteenth-century encounter between Britain’s  Nonconformist missionaries in Africa and the people of southern Tswana. The  Comaroffs attend to the everyday forms of consumption in homes, fields, and mis- sions that brought the Tswana into the global order of capitalism and contrib- uted to the rise of modernity in Europe, Africa, and beyond. For their purposes,  materiality means rather more than a concerted disposition toward things. The  critical intervention that puts materiality into play is a rebuke of the approaches to  colonialism centered on the “psychic forces” of “discourse and dialogics” (410) that  </page> <page sequence="16"> 66    Chapter Three cut colonialism off from the realities of social, economic, political, and cultural  experience. No mere “cultural formation” or “discursive field,” no mere problem  of “consciousness, representation, subjectivity, textuality,” colonialism is to the  Comaroffs in large measure about “material production” (19–20). Their primary  concern is the commodification of Tswana and its forced entry into the order of  capitalist relations. “Material” is here a capacious idea that accepts in its broad  folds all of colonialism’s lived realities on the ground—mundane human practices,  unequally distributed agencies, the tastes, styles, and gestures of quotidian life as it  is actually lived, as well as, to be sure, material things of the most solid and chunky  sort—cotton clothes and brass bedspreads, plows, cupboards, and windowpanes. Such an expansive mandate does not necessarily call for close dissection of  the affordances of things, assemblages, and their close-up encounters with their  makers and users (though nor does it foreclose such engagement). What matters  more is how objects are embedded and deployed in regimes of value and desire, in  projects of commodification, consumption, and civility. Objects and architecture  are very much present in this account. More often than not they figure as tools— powerful ones, to be sure—of human intention, particularly the intentions of the  evangelists who worked to remake personhood, habits, and notions of virtue and  value in southern Tswana through clothing and the design and trappings of the  home. The instrumental and semiotic logic of the object is clear: “Western cloth- ing, the social skin of civility, was to be both a sign and instrument of this meta- morphosis” (227, emphasis added; see also 267). The evangelists were not the only  ones who harnessed objects to their desired ends. The Tswana also used European  clothes, house furnishings, and architecture, sometimes unconventionally, in acts  of anachronism and bricolage that lay somewhere between rejection and accep- tance, and served as “a riposte to the symbolic imperialism of the mission tout  court“ (241). However unequally, the generative forces that changed the Tswana world  emanated from humans, who wielded their power through European objects— paradigmatic “intermediaries” in the Latourian sense. It was the human colo- nialist who was in the business of “making subjects by means of objects” (218).  Such asymmetry in the distribution of effort and effect lurks behind a language  of subtle displacement that stops short of the emancipation of the thing from the  over-determinacy of human agency and perception. Thus it is “style,” not the cot- ton of cotton clothes, that fabricates “new Southern Tswana social cleavages and  alliances” (255). It is “style,” not the wool of woolen blankets, that was part of the  “very making” of realities (273). One finds in this analysis a deliberate effort to  provenience effects not in matter per se, but in the meanings that cloak objects and  put them to work. To get this subtle nuance wrong requires correction: “African  subjects were reoriented and reoriented themselves, in large part, through recom- missioned European objects; more accurately, through regimes of such objects”  </page> <page sequence="17"> Imperial Matter    67 (12, first emphasis added). Precisely speaking, it is the systems of value in which  objects are ensnared that made the African subject, not the objects themselves.2 A more recent effort to rethink the relation between colonialism and things  represents the beginning of a significant shift toward according matter powerful  capacities to shape colonial encounters. In Archaeology and Colonialism (2004),  Chris Gosden defines colonialism as “a particular grip that material culture gets  on the bodies and minds of people” (3) or “a process by which things shape people,  rather than the reverse” (153). Of vital importance to Gosden is the production  and transmission of value, which occurs through our somatic relations with mate- rial culture. It is the attachment of human values to things that empower material  culture to “move people,” to cast them in their “thrall” (5, 20, 41, 81). Thus, we are  to understand that value-affixed things “grip” and “move” people in ways unique  to colonialism (though precisely how they generate these affective states, and how  they do so differently than in noncolonial contexts, is not quite clear). Gosden’s emphasis on the human-ascribed values attached to things means that  they are not quite yet mediators, able to bring about effects independent of human- ity’s plans for them. Yet at the same time, he clearly empowers things sufficiently to  suffer that most classic critique voiced by the material turn’s skeptics: he has been  said to fetishize material culture, to accord it too much determinacy at the expense  of human agency, to confuse human relations as relations between humans and  things (Dietler 2010: 20–21). Dietler urges us to resist the seductive trap of fetishism  to which, in his view, Gosden has succumbed, instead preferring to return things to  their proper place as “tools” and “symbolic markers” of control and cross-cultural  engagement—important tools and signs to be sure, but instruments nevertheless,  fettered to human choices and desires (20, 60, 63). But are not human relations both  relations among humans and among humans and things? Far from over-empowering  things, I would instead suggest that Gosden does not go quite far enough. As others have noted, one of the main points of divergence between material  culture studies and the turn to matter is the differential emphasis placed on con- sumption. Thomas’s Entangled Objects, the Comaroffs’ Of Revelation and Revo- lution, and Gosden’s Archaeology and Colonialism vigorously push the material  world to the front of their analyses of colonialism, but they do so only once objects,  embedded in putatively pre-existing social relations, have been tagged with mean- ings and values that allow them to fashion subjectivities. They do so primarily at  the point of consumption (see also Dietler 2010). These accounts “take as a start- ing point a world of objects that has, as it were, already crystallized out from the  fluxes of materials and their transformation” (Ingold 2007: 9). They are concerned  with objects that work instrumentally because they have been “turned into signs  and consumed as signs” (Olsen 2010: 32), in the Tswana case under a close colo- nial gaze. Insofar as value and signification are what empower things, they serve  as Latour’s intermediaries, which cause the secondary occurrences put in motion  </page> <page sequence="18"> 68    Chapter Three by human cognition. To study satrapal conditions is by no means to turn a blind  eye to consumption, use, and value, as we shall see in chapters 4–6. But it does  entail allowing matter—its vitality, properties, and the dependencies in which it  is entangled—to have a say in shaping imperial projects. Such is the work of del- egates, proxies, captives, and affiliates. DELEGATES “I found Rome built of clay: I leave it to you in marble” (Dio 1987: 245). The  famous boast of the emperor Augustus gives poetic voice to perhaps one of the  most unmistakable constellations of delegates in imperial history, the iconic  marble monuments of the Roman Empire. In the first several centuries a.d., the  city of Rome and countless other urban communities across the Mediterranean  became ensnared in a relationship with marble that was so ardent, it can fairly  be described as enslaving. From civic architecture to sculptural arts—basilicae  and temples, baths and theaters, fountains and statues—untold tons of this met- amorphic rock of recrystallized carbonite minerals made possible the practical  mediations of Roman authority. Marble permeated the public sphere, constitut- ing the spaces of assembly, commerce, and ritual, defining the terms of political  competition, leisure, and conspicuous consumption. Imperial agents came to rely  on its affective and practical contribution to the reproduction of Roman imperium  as ideology and practice. To feed the dependence on marble, Roman emperors  expropriated and exploited marble quarries in conquered lands from Asia Minor  to North Africa, from southern Spain to the French Pyrenees, sometimes trans- porting the stone on purpose-built carriers to reach the marble-yards of Rome.  This in turn set in motion practices of patronage and emulation by civic elites  across the Roman world, who refashioned their cities in Rome’s image to win favor  with citizens and sovereigns alike, fueling a complex commercial marble industry  that extended beyond the control of the imperial center (Long 2012). Marbles of  all sorts ensnared countless people in their use and care, from slave laborers to  rural landowners, from artisans to architects, from contractors to patrons, from  traders to pedestrians (4). The Roman Empire as we know it is simply unthinkable  without marble, a powerful substance that palpably made its own difference in the  perdurance of Roman sovereignty.3 But the political fixation with marble came  at a cost, fettering imperial agents to a material without which the total appara- tus of imperial sovereignty could not be maintained in its desired form. Marble  necessitated ever-expanding workforces and administrative resources. And at the  expense of civic prosperity, it entailed exorbitant expenditures that may have led  to stagnation in the growth of the Roman economy (284, 292). Like the marble public buildings of the Roman Empire, delegates are things that  take a share in the preservation of the very terms of imperial sovereignty through  </page> <page sequence="19"> Imperial Matter    69 the force of both their material composition and the practical mediations they  help afford. They are devilish things, however, for in return for their collabora- tions with the human agents of empire delegates in a certain sense come to gov- ern the very entities that empower them. The effects of delegates are unattainable  by humans alone, but this is not to deny a human role in their emergence and  workings. Because imperial agents appoint delegates to assist in their plans, such  things are kinds of representatives, conglomerating or standing in for the will and  worldview of many. Yet delegates are delegates less because of the source than the  outcomes of their actions, since their continuously unfolding effects are always in  excess of their assignments. The designation of a thing as a “delegate” has a well-known precedent in science  and technology studies. Latour (1992) used the term to refer to a very particular  class of things, namely technological mechanisms, like hydraulic door closers and  automated turnspits, that are tasked into action by humans in order to make easier  those functions that would require more effort if people had to carry them out  on their own (a porter to close a door, or a cook to turn a skewer). This is not,  however, what I mean by a delegate. Indeed, there is a curious elision in Latour’s  conception, a conspicuous silence on the political connotations of a word that is  ultimately concerned with empowerment. The focus of his formulation is on the  replacement of the human by the nonhuman, rather than on the element of desig- nation or authorization entailed in this transference. Latour’s (1992: 229) notion of  delegation involves “shifting down” to nonhumans work that humans could also  do if only they could be bothered or trusted. It is apparently an apolitical process  of substitution. But of course, not all nonhuman things accomplish their work by  standing in for us. Indeed, the vast majority of things that humans make and use  act in ways that are wholly beyond autonomous human capacities. In the sense forwarded here, delegates are less technological than political enti- ties, and thus they produce political effects. To restore the political connotations of  the term is to acknowledge three key qualities of delegates. First, since delegation  always entails the ceding of the prerogative to bring about effects from one entity  or assemblage to another, human or nonhuman, material delegates come to play a  role in the forces of political transformation under empire. They do so by mediat- ing, through direct somatic encounter, the practices that reproduce a sovereign’s  prerogative to rule. These nonhuman imperialists make their own difference in  the routines and rituals that sustain the values and institutions of an imperial pol- ity. As we shall see in chapters 4 and 5, it is not that delegates passively facilitate  such practices in dutiful accordance with the intentions of their creators. Delegates  are not intermediaries, obediently expressing or carrying out prescribed purposes.  They instead bring about effects that emerge from their own physicality, which  may block or facilitate, attract or deter, invite or impede, conjure or refuse, and  thereby keep the machinery of empire in motion. Delegates attain such efficacy  </page> <page sequence="20"> 70    Chapter Three in imperial reproduction not through their singular operation, but in confedera- tion with an extensive assemblage of other delegates, as well as privileged human  agents, who together collaborate in ad hoc groupings. Second, once empowered, delegates in some measure come to hold sway over  those who entrust them. It is the reliance that imperial agents come to have on  delegates, on both their physical materials and their political effects, for the pres- ervation of the very terms of imperial sovereignty, that are most critical to their  definition. Things of empire are delegates when the sovereign establishment is to  some degree fettered by its own need for the materials out of which such things are  made—the palm oil of British soap, the marble of imperial Rome, the alpaca wool  of the Incas, the silver of Achaemenid Persia. In such cases, sovereignty comes  to be contingent on the delegate materials on which it relies. The polity becomes  unviable or inconceivable in their collective absence. Such “contingent reliance” on  matter (Hodder 2012: 17–18) leads to a host of institutional effects—the extraction  of materials, the regulation of flows, the imposition of standards, the specializa- tion of skills—all vigorously ensured by the assemblages of violence. Importantly,  when it comes to delegate matter, instrumental and affective dependences come to  blur. Rome is no less conceivable without marble aqueducts than without marble  statuary. In this sense, in certain modes delegates are akin to Heidegger’s “gentle  things”—things that bring forth the material itself, rather than dissolving sub- stance into utilitarian purpose. Metals, once formed, come to glitter and shine;  rocks once polished reveal their colors and patterns. Such gentle things are the  work of poiesis, bringing forth the material and calling for its care (Olsen 2010: 83).  It is when materials compel imperial agents not only to instrumentally use them  but also to care for them through regimes of affect that the things forged of such  materials can be said to be delegates. Delegates and human imperial agents are  thus enmeshed in mutual dependence in Hodder’s sense, the former dependent  on the latter for their emergence, appointment, and care, the latter reliant on the  former for the continuance of the social order that upholds their positions in the  political community. PROXIES The allure and efficacy of delegates can paradoxically lead to the slow ero- sion of their own powers. Their desirable qualities and effects can trigger what  Michael Taussig (1993: 2) has called the mimetic faculty, which by its very force  “shares in or takes power from the represented.” That is, delegates can give rise  to what archaeologists and art historians of empire sometimes call “copies” or  “imitations”—things conventionally taken as local emulations of imperial canons  in alternative materials and modified forms. In contrast to delegates, such as the  marble public buildings of ancient Rome, proxies defy singular exemplification,  </page> <page sequence="21"> Imperial Matter    71 precisely because they are not exemplary but derivative. But terms like “copy” and  “imitation” are unfortunate misnomers because they implicitly repress the proper- ties and political potentialities of things under the replicative aspirations of their  makers. As their name implies, proxies, like delegates, are involved in the work of politi- cal representation. Like delegates, they also emerge out of assignments to act that  derive from sources outside themselves. These sources are both human and non- human; mechanically speaking, proxies are made out of the conjuncture of human  design and material affordance. Behind the human design are one or more mate- rial delegates that provide their templates for the proxy replacement that stands in  its place. Delegates confer the prerogative to act down the line to their less authen- tic proxies, whose representations can attenuate or dilute the delegate’s force. Prox- ies are in this sense at times rapscallion siblings of their delegates, whose political  mischief can arise out of (at least) two possible opportunities for slippage. The first opportunity can derive from their material properties. Unlike dele- gates, proxy matter does not entrap the most privileged human agents of empire  into relations of dependence, any more than proxy matter requires their care and  attention. The viability of imperial sovereignty is not necessarily contingent on  its extraction, regulation, policing, and concern. The differing relational proper- ties of delegates and proxies between their chemical composition and the humans  groups they ensnare give rise to a constitutional potentiality for proxies to bend the  rules. This possibility begins at the very point of production. As Timothy Ingold  (2000: 60) has argued, all material production takes place through a process of  interaction between material properties and a “field of forces” from the environ- ment to the human artisan. Human-made things are never merely the successful  outputs of the transcription of preconceived form onto raw material. The template  of the craftsperson does no more than set the parameters of the process that gives  rise to a thing, but does not exhaustively foreshadow the resulting form, because  form “is not imposed upon the material but arises through the work itself ” (61).  As Ingold notes, materials engage their makers as much as the makers ply their  materials (see also Malafouris 2008). In this mutual engagement, “the properties of  materials are directly implicated in the form-generating process” (Ingold 2000: 61). Since proxies can be made up of different materials than delegates, their prop- erties can press themselves on their makers during the form-generating process  in different ways than delegate matter, in turn producing forms that may differ, to  greater or lesser degrees, regardless of the precision of the craftsperson’s template.  The maker of the proxy has in mind a design, but the material does not follow  blueprints or dictates, governed as it is by its own movements and tolerances. It  is thus both the properties of the materials and the designs of the makers that  can account for the formal variance between delegates and proxies, whether sig- nificant or slight. Proxies are never really copies after all, or at least not “faithful”  </page> <page sequence="22"> 72    Chapter Three copies (Taussig 1993: 52). The dissimilitude between delegates and proxies that  results from this work is in part what invites the possibility of roguery. It precludes  the possibility of successful emulation and, as we shall see, it can support efforts at  mimicry and bricolage, or makeshift creativity. A second opportunity for unruliness can stem from the company that prox- ies keep, which is to say the immediate assemblage of humans and things with  which they collaborate in the production of social life. Proxies make a difference in  the world through their cooperation in assemblages usually made up primarily of  other nondelegates. The dutiful mediation of proxies in the practical reproduction  of rule can be attenuated if delegates reside at the peripheries of the assemblages  in which proxies mingle. I noted above that delegates are most efficacious in sup- porting the institutions of imperial sovereignty when they work in confederation  with other delegate partners. Proxies are more shallowly entangled in the work of  effective sovereignty because they act in relative isolation from a broader world of  nonhuman imperial agents. To be sure, human intention plays an important part in the work of unruly  emulation. Proxies can provoke dilutions of the values and ways of doing pro- mulgated by their material masters when human users deliberately harness them  to such unruly ends. Since the mid-1980s, social theory and postcolonial thought  have provided a well-worn vocabulary to capture this kind of human unruliness.  From Homi Bhabha’s (1997) concept of mimicry, to Michel de Certeau’s (1984:  xviii) analysis of the everyday tactical acts of “artisan-like inventiveness,” it is by  now clear that, operating within the bounds of dominant orders, humans can  “make do” through minor and creative appropriations and disruptions that “lend  a political dimension to everyday practices” (xvii). De Certeau and Bhabha alert  us to the unanticipated effects attendant on the replication of established logics  of practice, and thus fracture the metaphorical mirror that putatively represents  imperial values in the enamored consuming subject. But human intention alone cannot possibly realize the unanticipated effects  of bricolage and making do. What is left unsaid in these accounts is how matter  participates in the acts of mockery and play that Bhabha’s “mimic men” and de  Certeau’s “users” undertake (Khatchadourian, forthcoming). In the case of mim- icry, while it may be tempting to simply add materiality to its conceptual force  field (Fahlander 2007: 27), Bhabha’s own formulation simply does not permit this.  His mimicry is analytically limited by the denial of its practical operation beyond  the discursive field. Mimicry, to Bhabha, is not an agentive capacity of a colonial  subject (much less of matter), not a strategy of practice, but a pathology imposed  on the subject by the authoritative voice of colonial power in a space of discourse  that is, even if ambivalent, nevertheless closed (Aching 2002: 32–38). De Certeau  may offer more scope for the admission of matter into the tactical art of imitation  by the consuming masses. In a certain sense, however, he observes the tactical  </page> <page sequence="23"> Imperial Matter    73 practices of subjects whose capacities for creativity emerge in spite of a backdrop of  constraining objects. Thus bricolage operates in the ways that a given text is read,  or a planned city is walked, such that tactics become tactics only when the subject  escapes or subverts the prescriptions of the object. A consideration of the unruliness of proxies shifts the analytical emphasis from  the craftiness of users to the craftiness of the craft itself, and explores how material  things can be accomplices in human acts, not impediments or passive props. Due  to the ways in which they deviate from delegates in their material properties and  in the company they keep, proxies encourage and invite human efforts at gentle  play in the arts of production and consumption. Proxies themselves can help dif- fuse the hegemonic force of that which the dominant make available. It is in the  material and contextual distance between delegates and proxies that things can go  wrong (or go right, depending on one’s vantage), that the practices and principles  of an empire can be dulled by what are, in effect, material malcontents. The chal- lenge is to distinguish between poor and proper proxies, between those things that  act in accordance with the delegates that authorize them, and those that may help  their makers and users tinker with, poach from, or evade the expectations that  their delegate assemblages recommend or impose. CAPTIVES If proxies originate from the centrifugal flows of delegates that stream outward,  however periphrastically, from centers of imperial cultural production, captives  are displaced things moving in reverse, deported along centripetal routes that lead  on a straight course toward imperial centers. Captives are political things com- pelled to collaborate with the sovereign in reproducing the terms of authority and  subjection. We need look no further than the idols of the conquered in the Inca  Empire, in many ways consummate material captives, to appreciate the role that  captivation can play in the making of satrapal conditions. According to the Span- ish Jesuit missionary Bernabé Cobo (1990: 3–4), the Incas purloined the idols of  subject lands and brought them to the imperial capital of Cuzco as hostages: When some provinces rebelled against them, the Incas ordered the protective native  gods of the rebellious province to be brought out and put in public, where they were  whipped ignominiously every day until such province was made to serve the Incas  again. After the rebels were subdued, their gods were restored to their places and  honored with sacrifices. At this time the Incas would say that the province had been  subdued through the power of the rebels’ gods, who wanted to avoid being insulted.  And it is even said that the majority of the rebels surrendered just because they heard  that their idols were exposed to public insults. Material captives are the consequences of theft that come to assume a share  in the work of political and cultural domination. They are the casualties of what  </page> <page sequence="24"> 74    Chapter Three John MacKenzie (1995: 53) has called “that ultimate imperial act,” and they can  take several forms. Captives were the spoils marched through the streets of Rome  during triumphal processions, eventually to adorn public buildings and private  homes alike as constant reminders of conquest and as a continuing “incentive to  glory” (Beard 2007: 30). Captives are the “curiosities” from colonized lands that  British explorers, missionaries, officials, and ethnologists, with the approval of the  state, the navy, and the Royal Society, acquired and subsumed under the author- ity of disinterested science, or harnessed to the emerging imperialist narratives  of evolutionary hierarchies, or destroyed in the name of idolatry, or objectified  in the name of colonial knowledge and control (Thomas 1991: 138–139, 153, 175).  Captives too were the countless antiquities that British and French scholars and  bureaucrats took from their colonial possessions in order to fill private collec- tions and museums in Europe with artifacts that affirmed the manifest destiny  of Western civilization (e.g. Bahrani 2003; Cohn 1996: 76–105). Finally, no less  captive are those provincial things that become targets for innovative replication  and co-optation in the imperial metropole—the weak prey in the theft of ideas on  materials, their forms, and forces. Redeployed to metropolitan ends, these bor- rowings too are things of imperial appropriation, from the imitation orientalia of  nineteenth-century Europe’s world exhibitions (Mitchell 1988) to, as we shall see in  the next chapter, the co-opted and adapted architectural canons of ancient Persia’s  urban landscapes. Captives, then, are things in states of displacement and dislocation, things  wrested from their embedded dependencies in now subjugated communities and  thrown into new entanglements. Conscripted into the work of imperial repro- duction, captives often undergo a modal shift, transmogrifying from captives to  delegates. Captives, in other words, are liminal, chameleonic things, irreducible to  the cultural property of either sovereigns or subjects. They are, like proxies, things  that disrupt those very social categories, things that—through their crossing—  blur the boundaries between conquerors and conquered and make possible the  willing or unwilling incorporation of the latter into the work of imperial hege- mony (Gramsci 1971). AFFILIATES “Missing masses” is what Latour (1992) called the overlooked, mundane, non- human mechanisms that hold societies together, a term that also best describes  imperialism’s unnoticed affiliates. By affiliates I mean the great throngs of incon- spicuous things that reproduce social life under empire, even as they preserve an  inviolable space of experience within it. I am speaking of local habitats and habili- ments, apparatuses and adornments, foods and furnishings that bind people under  empire into distinct collectivities. Unlike delegates, proxies, and captives, affiliates  </page> <page sequence="25"> Imperial Matter    75 become imperial things by sheer happenstance, carried along by the human and  nonhuman forces that brought them under the net of empire. Whereas delegates,  proxies, and captives come to directly mold and modify the logics of imperial  sovereignty, stimulating new practices, affects, values, and dependencies among  imperial agents in metropoles and provinces alike, affiliates stand at a considerable  remove from the human agents and centers of state power, falling beyond the gaze  of sovereigns and satraps, and instead bound in mutual dependencies with com- moners in homes, villages, towns, and cities. The forms and effects of affiliates are pervasive and varied, but nevertheless  unified by the way in which such things maintain, deepen, and impel affective  and practical ties to place and to the community of human agents who collectively  depend on them. Affiliates are the things that make it possible to preserve dif- ference among the disparate groups that imperial formations envelop into their  folds—the distinctive forms of dress or dwelling, the tools of subsistence and the  paraphernalia of ritual, the things of leisure and luxury that to some degree retain  an existence despite or alongside imperialism’s new “gifts.” While, through move- ment and display, delegates, proxies, and captives variously traffic in the spread of  practices and principles across social boundaries, to the point where they become  unequivocally imperial things, affiliates mark the limits of such diffusion and the  unmitigated imperial conquest over the material world. Such armies of things,  the immense masses with which most imperial subjects daily interact, keep their  distance and hold their ground, passively affiliating with empire only by virtue of  their existence within imperialized social worlds that had no direct part in their  genesis. In this way, the work of affiliates is ambiguous, on the one hand affording the  practices of everyday life that make possible the exploitation of resources and bod- ies, and on the other hand preserving the possibility of imagining a social existence  once again unanswerable to distant sovereigns. This work is accomplished through  the material properties of affiliates themselves, and the “local” entanglements and  webs of dependency in which they and their human users are mutually enmeshed. CONCLUSION The schema of delegates, proxies, captives, and affiliates does not aspire to compre- hensively envelop all the molecularly or ethereally constituted entities contained  by the concept “thing.” Nor does this conceptual apparatus attempt to do work at  the fuzzy boundaries where organic and inorganic, human animal and nonhuman  animal, blur—where “the us and the it slip-slide into each other” (Bennett 2010:  4; see also Latour 2000; Stengers 2010). This framework does not invest heav- ily in policing what does and does not count as matter, nor does it utterly tran- scend old dualisms, as the “new materialisms” espouse (Coole and Frost 2010). It  </page> <page sequence="26"> 76    Chapter Three is possible to recognize the vitality of matter in the imperial enterprise, decenter- ing the human as the locus of all agency, without refusing the different forms that  such vitalism can take as a matter of degree and not kind. Human and nonhu- man organic bodies of course belong to the universe of matter, and themselves  have fluid existential boundaries. And while all material beings may be mutually  generative in their emergence, a fully “monological account” (Coole and Frost  2010: 8) of existence runs the risk of effacing the “presumption of difference” to  which different kinds of beings are entitled (A. T. Smith 2015: 20; see also Olsen  2010: 96). To build a theory of imperial things around the ordinary things that  humans experience in everyday life and suspend judgment on living, highly tran- sitory, incorporeal, or marginal phenomena is not to deny them materiality. Nor  is it to fall into the trap of Cartesian oppositions, since all matter is here accorded  some efficacy, and humans are deprived of the fiction that “‘we’ really are in charge  of all those ‘its’” (Bennett 2010: x). But the approach advanced, which readily cur- tails the human monopoly on “agentic efficacy” (Coole and Frost 2010: 14), takes  as a starting point the nonsentient but by no means inert materials that can per- haps be said to have come to occupy the center of thing ontology, or the space  where ontological debates on things today hold the lowest stakes. We have yet to  come to grips with how the solid, chunky, bounded objects of traditional ontolo- gies inflict “some kind of blow” on imperial realities, to paraphrase Graham Har- man (2010: 20), much less living species and microorganisms, bodily reactions,  and other natural or transitory forces. One way or another, if inquiry centered on  things is to move beyond problems of ontology to politics or society, it becomes  necessary to somehow heuristically segment the mind-bogglingly infinite world  of nonequivalent matter, and to focus on certain things—things that may possess  certain degrees of nonsentience—embedded in the relational webs that link them  with others. In chapter 1 we saw that the satrapal condition registers two dialectically  related phenomena, on the one hand conjuring the experience of subjection, as  it is generated through human encounters with the material world, and on the  other hand recognizing the limits of imperial sovereignty, as these are produced  in the relations of humans and matter. In the latter sense the satrapal condition  acknowledges the potential attenuation of imperial rule as a very consequence  of its extensive reach. I suggested that such limitations, restrictions, or modifica- tions arise from the inevitable dependencies of imperial agents on the practical  actions and material entanglement of their subjects. We can now be more spe- cific in naming some of the material actants responsible for such conditions of  effective and attenuated sovereignty. The reproduction and attenuation of imperial  sovereignty depends in part on the variable roles played by delegates, proxies, cap- tives, and affiliates in social and political life. These material participants are by  no means predestined to create particular satrapal conditions, but they do exhibit  </page> <page sequence="27"> Imperial Matter    77 predilections or tendencies depending on their relations, properties, and media- tions, as well as on the confederacies of humans and other things with which they  assemble. On a heuristic continuum, taut entanglements with assemblages dense  in delegates, captives, and proxies will be efficacious in the reproduction of condi- tions of imperial subjection, while tight mutual dependencies between humans  and confederacies of affiliates and proxies will generate the conditionals of impe- rial rule, opening the possibilities for autonomous action, deviation and devi- ance, indifference, or the imagination of alternative futures. In reality, of course,  there are limitless permutations between these poles, and it is hardly the point to  advance a cookie-cutter model of the relations between sovereigns, subjects, and  things that obscures the untidy contingencies of imperial histories. Indeed, as we  now turn in part 2 to the Achaemenid Empire, precisely such complexities and  ambiguities will come to the fore. Yet we approach the expanse stretching from the  windswept mountains of the Caucasus and the Armenian highland to the plains  of southwest Iran now equipped with the analytical tools for conceptualizing the  variegated work of things in the making and experience of satrapal conditions. </page> <page sequence="28">  </page> </plain_text>
