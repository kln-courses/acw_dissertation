<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATIONAL CONTEXT, PARENTAL SOCIALIZATION, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF: RESULTS FROM 15 NATIONS Jonathan Kelley Nan Dirk De Graaf Institute of Advanced Studies, Nijmegen University, The Australian National University The Netherlands How much does a nation's religious environment affect the religious beliefs of its citizens? Do religious nations differfrom secular nations in how beliefs are passed on from generation to generation? To find out, we use data from the 1991 International Social Survey Programme collected in 15 nations from 19,815 respondents. We use diagonal reference models estimated by nonlin- ear regression to control for a nation's level of economic development and exposure to Communism, andfor the individual's denomination, age, gender, and education. We find that (1) people living in religious nations will, in proportion to the religiosity of their fellow-citizens, acquire more orthodox beliefs than otherwise similar people living in secular nations; (2) in rela- tively secular nations, family religiosity strongly shapes children's religious beliefs, while the influence of national religious context is small; (3) in rela- tively religious nations family religiosity, although important, has less effect on children's beliefs than does national context. These three patterns hold in rich nations and in poor nations, in formerly Communist nations and in es- tablished democracies, and among old and young, men and women, the well- educated and the poorly educated, andfor Catholics and Protestants. Find- ings on the link between belief and church attendance are inconsistent with the influential "supply-side" analysis of differences between nations. R eligion remains a central element of modern life, shaping people's world- views, moral standards, family lives, and in many nations, their politics. But in many Western nations, modernization and secular- ization may be eroding Christian beliefs, with profound consequences that have in- trigued sociologists since Durkheim. Yet this much touted secularization may be over- stated-certainly it varies widely among na- tions and is absent in the United States * Direct all correspondence to Jonathan Kelley, ISP RSSS ANU, Canberra 0200, Australia (jonathan.kelley@anu.edu.au), or to Nan Dirk De Graaf, Department of Sociology, Nijmegen Uni- versity, P.O.

We explore the degree to which religious beliefs are passed on from generation to generation in different nations. Devout parents socialize their children, in- culcating religious beliefs in most of them. But inevitably some offspring break with their parents' beliefs-especially between ages 10 and 30 when children come in con- tact with the wider world, with teachers and peer groups, when they mature and take jobs, acquire new friends, and eventually marry suits for all analyses.

If there were no influences other than the family to inculcate belief, even a small loss in each generation would even- tually produce a secular society. We propose that one source of the durabil- ity of religious belief is the religious context of the nation as a whole: In proportion to the orthodoxy of their fellow citizens, people born into religious nations will acquire more orthodox beliefs than otherwise similar people born into secular nations. Following the literatures on religious socialization, secularization, and geographic differences in religious beliefs, we argue that this contex- tual effect comes about in part through people's exposure to religious culture (and perhaps to pro-religious government poli- cies), and in part because the pools of poten- tial friends, teachers, colleagues, and mar- riage partners are predominantly devout. Conversely, in secular societies, individuals are likely to acquire secular friends, teach- ers, colleagues, and marriage partners and so become secular themselves. We test this ar- gument, which has not previously been rig- orously tested.' Moreover, we go beyond these traditional claims, arguing that these processes interact with the family's religious background in ways that make family back- ground more important in secular nations, but make national context more important in religious nations. THEORY Devout parents inculcate religious beliefs in their children directly by explicit teaching and by example, and indirectly by shaping their children's views of life (Benson et al. I An important cross-national literature as- sesses church attendance, mainly using aggregate data. In a review, Stark and lannaccone (1994: 239-41) argue that church attendance reflects the interplay of "potential demand" for religious ser- vices (general beliefs in the supernatural that pro- vide a motive for attending religious services) and the "supply" of religious services offered in each nation, with the "supply-side" characteris- tics of nations strongly influencing church atten- dance. Our argument and data speak to the poten- tial demand for services, and thus complement their approach. Unlike Stark and Tannaccone's analysis, however, ours relies on individual-level data rather than aggregate-level data. 1989:162-66; Francis and Brown 1991; Hoge and Petrillo 1978; Myers 1996). This process is not unique to religion-parents also incul- cate moral values, political preferences, and a wide variety of other attitudes, values, and preferences (Acock and Bengtson 1978; Jennings, Allerbeck, and Rosenmayr 1979; Jennings and Markus 1984). But parents are not the only force affecting religious beliefs. Children acquire diverse friends outside the family, forming peer groups that by adolescence exert a strong in- dependent influence on their religious beliefs (Hoge and Petrillo 1978; Spika, Hood, and Gorsuch 1985). Children also come into con- tact with schools and teachers who may shape their values (Benson et al. 1989:166-67; Greeley and Gockel 1971). Children are ex- posed to religious values (or their absence) in school curricula, the mass media, and the nation's culture. Some are exposed to gov- ernment sponsored propaganda that can shape their views-either pro-religious (as in Ireland and many Islamic nations) or antireli- gious (as in Eastern Europe in Communist times) (Stark and lannaccone 1994:236-39). In time, children leave home, reducing their parents' impact on their beliefs, behavior, and values (Need and De Graaf 1996). They ac- quire new friends, new colleagues at work, and new peer groups, all of which may shape their religious views (Wuthnow 1994). Even- tually, they marry, founding new families that become central influences on their lives, strongly shaping (and being shaped by) their religious and other values (Hoge and Petrillo 1978; Need and De Graaf 1996). Religious beliefs thus depend not only on parents' reli- gious beliefs, but also on the religious con- tent of school curricula and the mass media, on the religious policies of the government and churches, on the general religious con- tent of the nation's culture and dominant val- ues, and especially on the religious "environ- ment" that people live in-their friends, peer groups, schools, teachers, and marriage partners. To some extent, people shape their reli- gious environments by choosing religiously compatible friends, colleagues, and marriage partners. They may even convert their friends and (especially) their marriage partners to their own religious beliefs. Thus to some ex- tent, religious environment is a consequence</page><page sequence="3">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 641 of prior religious convictions, and not an in- fluence on them. But a person's religious environment is also shaped by factors other than their own and their parents' religious beliefs, and hence is a potential cause of those beliefs, not a consequence of them. Friends and spouses are chosen on the basis of propinquity, per- sonality, interests, education, occupation, po- litical views, sheer chance, and many other traits besides religion. Schools are chosen on the basis of quality, cost, or location, not just religious compatibility. Jobs and employers are chosen more on the basis of opportunity, pay, interest, and propinquity rather than for religious reasons. We argue that prominent among these "unchosen" aspects of one's religious envi- ronment is birthplace. People have no con- trol over where they are born. Hence they have no choice about whether they grow up in a predominantly religious or predomi- nantly secular culture, and no choice about whether they are exposed to pro- or antireli- gious policies and propaganda by church and state. If they are born into a predominantly devout nation, the pool of potential friends, teachers, colleagues, and marriage partners will differ from the pool available in a pre- dominantly secular nation. As a conse- quence, and other things being equal, people born into a religious nation are likely to ac- quire religious friends, teachers, colleagues, and marriage partners and therefore are likely to become (or remain) religious. Con- versely, people born into secular nations are likely to acquire secular friends, teachers, colleagues, and spouses, and therefore are likely to become secular themselves. The same logic applies to people born during par- ticularly religious or irreligious periods of a nation's history, or in particularly religious or irreligious geographic regions. Hence: Hypothesis 1: People born into religious na- tions will, in proportion to the orthodoxy of their fellow-citizens, acquire more or- thodox beliefs than otherwise similar people born into secular nations. This type of contextual hypothesis, using the dependent variable to define the context, has a long history in sociology and political science (e.g., Blalock 1984:353-59; Prze- worski 1974). In our case, the dependent variable is the individual's religious belief, and nations are classified according to the average intensity of their citizens' religious beliefs. At first glance, such reasoning may seem circular, but such relationships are far from tautological (Blalock 1984:363-69; Boyd and Iversen 1979:22-59). For instance, the familiar and seemingly obvious ecologi- cal hypothesis that local political context in- fluences voting behavior (Butler and Stokes 1974:130-37) turns out on closer analysis to be false (Kelley and McAllister 1985). Further, we argue that national religious context has different effects on the strategies of devout and secular families. In a predomi- nantly secular society, children are likely to acquire secular friends, teachers, work col- leagues, and marriage partners. This poses a serious problem for devout parents and their churches: To ensure that their children ac- quire and retain orthodox religious beliefs, they need to control the children's social en- vironments and restrict their choices of friends to those with compatible religious beliefs. They do this by screening potential friends, teachers, and marriage partners; by enrolling their children in church groups or sending them to religious schools to ensure an appropriate pool of potential friends and marriage partners; by socializing their chil- dren to reject the irreligious; and in many other ways (Benson et al. 1989:164-67; Stark and McCann 1993). Insofar as parents succeed in controlling their children's social environments, they effectively shut out most of the irreligious national environment's secularizing pressures. Hence, the effect of the family's religious background will be large and the effect of national environment will be small. Conversely, in a predominantly religious society, devout parents need not worry about the possibility of their children acquiring secular beliefs from friends, teachers, col- leagues, or spouses, because almost everyone is devout. Therefore, devout parents need not invest time, effort, or money in controlling their children's social environments; they need not endure the emotional strain and po- tential conflict this imposes on parent-child relations; and they need not accept the po- tential loss of desirable friends and marriage partners that such restrictions would impose on their children.</page><page sequence="4">642 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Irreligious parents face the opposite con- straints. In a secular society, they need not worry about their children getting into a de- vout social environment, because most po- tential friends, colleagues, and marriage part- ners are secular. In a religious society, how- ever, their children are at risk of being drawn into a devout social environment. Thus, if the prospect of their children acquiring religious beliefs is distasteful, parents have a strong incentive to control their children's environ- ment. We suggest, however, that most secular parents will not strongly object to their chil- dren accepting some religious tenets. Few secular parents are committed atheists-most are agnostic or believe in some vague higher power if not in a personal, anthropocentric god (Greeley 1992:66-68). Even if they are convinced there is no God, parents may see little harm in their children becoming reli- gious-the duties imposed by religion are rarely onerous, the emotional support and sense of meaning and purpose religion pro- vides are valuable (Poloma and Pendelton 1990), and there is usually no "antichurch" institution encouraging secularism (save those countries under Communist rule). Moreover, being secular in a devout nation can have practical disadvantages because of prejudice on the part of the religious, and the restrictions that prejudice can impose on choices of friends, schools, jobs, and mar- riage partners. Hence, we suggest, most secular parents will make little effort to in- sulate their children from the religious pres- sures of a devout society. Nor will secular parents prevent their children from acquiring devout friends, colleagues, and marriage partners. As a consequence, many children of secular parents will become religious. Thus: Hypothesis 2a: In relatively secular societies, devout families usually insulate their children from secular pressures, hence family background strongly shapes reli- gious beliefs while national influences are small. Hypothesis 2b: In relatively devout societies, secular families do not usually insulate their children from religious pressures, hence family background has little effect on religious beliefs and national influ- ences are large. DATA Data are from the 1991 "Religion" module of the International Social Survey Pro- gramme (ISSP), an international consortium composed primarily of academic survey or- ganizations (Zentralarchive 1993). Each year, the ISSP creates a module containing exactly the same questions, answer catego- ries, and sequencing for all countries sur- veyed. This module is then fielded in con- junction with each country's regular annual survey. Each country also collects detailed data on background and demographic vari- ables, using questions appropriate to local circumstances and institutions. The samples are all large, representative national samples of adults. The most com- mon procedure is to hold face-to-face inter- views with a stratified random sample (occa- sionally a panel on an earlier sample), fol- lowed by a leave-behind self-completion questionnaire containing the ISSP module (Zentralarchive 1993). Some surveys are conducted entirely by interview, and a few are entirely self-completion. Completion rates average over 60 percent (counting losses both at the interview and the self- completion stages). These rates compare fa- vorably with recent experiences in many in- dustrial nations. For example, the completion rates for the highly regarded 1989 "Interna- tional Crime Victimization Survey" averaged 41 percent over 14 nations (Van Dijk, May- hew, and Killias 1990). ISSP data appear ac- curately to reflect opinion in each nation and have been widely used in international com- parisons (e.g., Kelley and Evans 1993, 1995). Data were processed by the Zentralarchiv (Scheuch and Uher 1993). In all there are 19,815 cases: 2,203 in Aus- tralia (Kelley, Evans, and Bean 1993); 984 in Austria (Haller and Hoellinger 1993); 1,486 in East Germany (Mohler and Braun 1992); 1,257 in Great Britain (Jowell et al. 1992); 1000 in Hungary (Kolosi 1992); 1,005 in Ire- land (Ward and Whelan 1992); 983 in Italy (Calvi 1992); 1,635 in the Netherlands (So- cial and Cultural Planning Office 1992); 1,070 in New Zealand (Gendall 1992); 838 in Northern Ireland (Jowell et al. 1992); 1,506 in Norway (Norwegian Social Science Data Services 1992); 1,063 in Poland (Cichomski 1992); 2,080 in Slovenia (Tos</page><page sequence="5">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 643 Table 1.

In to- tal, there are 17,635 cases with complete data on all variables in our model.2 MEASUREMENT Religious Belief Our religious belief scale, which conceptu- ally and empirically resembles standard reli- gious orthodoxy scales used in previous re- search (Felling et al. 1991; Van der Slik 1994), measures belief in a supernatural be- ing who is concerned with each individual human (Table 1). Most of the items have been used previously in the NORC General Social Survey in the United States, the SOCON survey in the Netherlands, or the World Values Survey in many nations. In our pooled sample, 12 percent do not believe in God, 10 percent are agnostic, 15 percent believe not in a personal God but in a higher power of some kind, 9 percent be- lieve in God some of the time but not at other times, 20 percent believe but have some doubts, and 34 percent believe in God and have no doubts (Table 1, item 1). Only 1 percent did not answer. We score these an- swers conventionally in equal intervals, from a low of 0 ("do not believe in God") to a high of 100 ("believe and have no doubts"). This scoring gives a clear and con- venient metric (Evans, Kelley, and Kolosi 1992:468-69), but any other equal-interval scoring would lead to mathematically iden- tical standardized results and metric results differing only by a linear transformation. Using our scoring, belief in God averages 63 points out of 100, with a standard devia- tion of 36. Using this 0 to 100 scoring, answers to a question which focuses on stability of belief over time average 72 points (question 2), feelings of personal closeness to God aver- age 57 (question 3), and degrees of belief in a God who concerns himself with every per- son (question 4) average 51. 2 We do not use the Israeli dataset, the Russian dataset (which omits some key variables), or the Philippines dataset (which has a serious process- ing error). These four items are highly correlated in all 15 nations, suggesting that they all mea- sure a single underlying factor (Table 2). In the pooled sample, inter-item correlations average .79 with a scale reliability (alpha) of .93; reliabilities are between .79 and .95 in each nation separately. Factor loadings aver- age .88 in the pooled analysis, with equally high figures in separate analyses for each country. The four items also have very simi- lar correlations with other variables in the model both in the pooled sample and within each nation (results available from the au- thors). Our religious orthodoxy scale is the aver- age of answers to the four questions in Table 1. Respondents who answered some but not all questions are assigned the average of the questions they did answer. Those who failed to answer any of the questions (1 percent) are omitted from the analysis. Parents' Church Attendance We measure the religious orientation of the family in which each respondent was raised by their mother's and father's church atten- dance when the respondent was 14 or 15 years old. Previous research indicates that church attendance-a clear-cut behavior-is reliably reported and is generally the key family influence, with strong direct and indi- rect effects on respondent's religion (Benson et al. 1989:163-66; Hoge and Petrillo 1978). Because we are interested in the overall ef- fect of the family, we average mother's and father's church attendance. If data were available for only one parent, we used that. Only 7 percent failed to answer for at least one parent.3 Mother's and father's church at- tendance are highly correlated (r = .77 in the pooled sample), and have similar correlations with other variables (results available on re- quest). Averaging them gives a reliable mea- sure (alpha = .93 in the pooled sample); separating them would unnecessarily compli- cate the analysis and would be difficult be- cause of their high correlation. Previous re- search on their relative importance is incon- clusive (Benson et al. 1989:165-66; Acock 3 An analysis excluding cases with missing data on either parent's church attendance leads to the same conclusions as our preferred model.</page><page sequence="7">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 645 Table 2.

We group parents' church attendance into five groups (scored 1 to 5 in the analysis): Secular(l) Parents never attend church, or have no religion; (2) Parents attend about once a year; (3) Parents attend several times a year up to once a month; (4) Parents attend several times a month up to almost every week; and Devout (5) Parents attend every week or more often. One complication is that church attendance might have different meanings in different nations. Regular church attendance could in- dicate that parents are unusually devout in nations in which church attendance is atypi- cal or politically unpopular (as in the former East Germany during the Communist era), or where "monopolistic" churches make little effort to provide attractive and diverse ser- vices (Stark and Iannaccone 1994). If so, this could introduce some error in our analysis, which assumes that the meaning of parents' church attendance is comparable in all 15 nations. Lacking data on parents' beliefs, we can not test for this possibility directly. But we can test it indirectly by looking at the re- lation between respondent's church atten- dance and the intensity of respondent's reli- gious belief, on the reasonable assumption that this reflects the usual pattern for the respondent's nation (Table 3). Regular church attendees have much the same religious beliefs in all the nations for which we have data (Table 3). Those who at- tend weekly average 89 points (out of 100) in religious belief, and this figure varies only</page><page sequence="8">646 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 3.

Those who attend church almost every week are a little less de- vout on average, those who attend monthly are a little less devout again, and those who attend only a few times a year are noticeably less devout; but for all groups the pattern is similar in all 13 nations. The largest varia- tion occurs among those who never attend church: Their religious beliefs average 34 points, indicating that for the most part they do not believe in a God who is personally concerned with each human being but they are uncertain about the matter, or they be- lieve in some kind of higher power. However East Germans who never attend are notice- ably less devout than the average, scoring only 12 points, while Americans (63 points) and the Northern Irish (65 points) are notice- ably more devout. Thus, there is some uncer- tainty about parents who never attend church. To test whether these difficulties affect our results, we excluded the deviant cases from the analysis (East German, American, and Northern Irish respondents raised by parents who never went to church) and reestimated our preferred model. The results are virtually unchanged (results available from the au- thors), and we conclude that these uncertain- ties are not consequential for our analysis. Note that these findings are not consistent with the influential "supply-side" argu- ment-that nations with religious monopo- lies have large unmet religious needs, while churches in religiously competitive nations like the United States more successfully meet the population's diverse religious needs. This argument implies that those who do not at- tend church are more devout in monopolistic societies. But our findings show exactly the opposite: People who don't attend church are actually more devout in religiously competi- tive societies like the United States and Northern Ireland. Secular and Religious Nations Measuring how secular or religious a respondent's national environment was when he or she was growing up, requires a mea- sure of the religiosity of other people in the nation-the people among whom the respon- dents would find their friends, teachers, and spouses. We measure national religiosity by</page><page sequence="9">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 647 an unweighted average of parental church at- tendance in the nation as a whole and reli- gious belief in the nation as a whole. Char- acterizing contexts by the average level of the dependent variable, or some similar vari- able, is usual and appropriate (Blalock 1984: 363-68; Boyd and Iversen 1979:22-59). It would not be wise to characterize each na- tion separately using dummy variables (Blalock 1984:357; Farkas 1974). We di- vided the nations into five groups ranging from most secular to most religious (scored 1 to 5 in the analysis): Secular (1) East Germany and Norway; (2) Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Slovenia, the Netherlands; (3) West Germany and Austria; (4) United States and Italy;4 and Religious (5) Northern Ireland, Poland, and Ireland. Other plausible measures give much the same ranking of nations and lead to virtually identical results (results available from the authors). Other Contextual Characteristics of Nations Modernization theory suggests that reli- gious belief will decline as nations become more prosperous, educated, and modern (e.g., Becker and Vink 1994; Peters 1993). To take these factors into account, we mea- sure a nation's level of development by its gross national product per capita in 1987, at parity purchasing power (World Bank 1996). For clarity, we express these figures as percentages of the U.S. GNP, ranging from a low of 21 (Poland) to a high of 100 (United States). For some 40 years preceding our surveys, many Communist nations followed explicit antireligious policies. We take this into ac- count by including a dummy variable coded 4Although the United States and Italy have very different religious institutions ("supply")- an established monopolistic church in Italy, but religious diversity in the United States-the key issue for our analysis is the level of belief in the general public ("demand"), and that is similar in the two countries. 1 for formerly Communist nations and 0 otherwise. A large literature argues for "American exceptionalism" in religion. In theory, America's competitive, entrepreneurial, open "religious market" contrasts so sharply with the typical European situation-in which there is an established church with a reli- gious monopoly-that two different para- digms seem appropriate (Warner 1993). Em- pirically, the traditional paradigm (Berger 1969) based on European experience sees the high levels of religiosity in the United States as atypical of modern industrial societies. We therefore include a dummy variable coded 1 for the United States and 0 otherwise. Individual Characteristics Because Catholics and Protestants differ in a variety of ways (Peters and Schreuder 1987; Weber [1921] 1972), we include two dummy variables for parents' denomination: one for Catholics and one for non-Christians. The reference category is Protestant (together with a few atheists and nondenominational Christians). We also test for interactions in- volving Catholicism, family background, and national context because Catholics differ from Protestants in the balance of the indi- vidual and institutional orientations in their religions (Weber [1921] 1972). Because religious belief typically in- creases with age (Benson et al. 1989:157- 59), and nations differ in their age structures, we include respondent's age (in years). Men typically are less devout than women (Benson et al. 1989:159-60), and nations dif- fer somewhat in their sex composition-so we include sex (coded 1 for men and 0 for women). Well-educated individuals are generally less devout than are the poorly educated (Benson et al. 1989:166-67), and education is correlated both with parents' church atten- dance and GNP. We therefore include educa- tion measured in years of schooling follow- ing ISSP definitions (Zentralarchiv 1993).

Design of the Diagonal Reference Model: Combinations of Parents' Church Attendance and National Religiosity Note: Shaded cells represent the average religiosity of each consistent ideal-typical cell. The order of the rows is reversed (5 to 1 rather than the usual 1 to 5) to correspond with Figures 2 through 4. tions can be represented in a three-dimen- sional table, with nations in the rows (ranked from secular to religious), family back- ground in the columns (ranked from secular to devout), and each cell displaying the aver- age religious belief score of respondents liv- ing in that religious a nation and coming from that devout a family (for the moment we ignore control variables like age and GNP). For clarity, we make the table square, with five categories of national religiosity and five categories of parents' church atten- dance. The ideal-typical religious settings are on the main diagonal: The religious extreme is represented by people living in devout na- tions and coming from devout families; the secular extreme is represented by people liv- ing in secular nations and coming from secu- lar families. Between these extremes are other ideal-typical settings-people living in nations of intermediate levels of religiosity and coming from families with intermediate levels of devoutness. In these diagonal cells, the religiosity of the nation is congruent with the devoutness of the family. We model the religiosity of cells with an inconsistent con- text-cells in which the devoutness of the nation is not consistent with the devoutness of the family-as a function of cells with consistent contexts. Diagonal reference models (Hendrickx et al. 1993; Sobel 1981) are designed to model situations of this sort in a clear and parsimo- nious manner. These models have been ap- plied to a variety of similar inconsistency and mobility problems, such as social mobility and fertility (Sobel 1985), educational mobil- ity and apostasy (Van der Slik, De Graaf, and Peters 1995), social mobility and politics (De Graaf, Nieuwbeerta, and Heath 1995; De Graaf and Ultee 1990), and the effects of het- erogamy (De Graaf and Heath 1992; Van Berkel and De Graaf 1995). Although diago- nal reference models originally were de- signed to model the impact of individual variables, they can be used to model the im- pact of macro variables like national context, giving unbiased point estimates of contextual effects of national characteristics.5 The design can be visualized as shown in Figure 1, where w is the weight for the na- tional devoutness and 1-w is the weight for 5 The disadvantage is that the standard errors will be slightly low. Multi-level methods (Gold- stein 1987) would allow us to estimate similar but much less parsimonious linear models while giv- ing asymptotically correct standard errors. The diagonal reference model applied to this problem produces a single standard error that applies to both the individual's family background and the macro context of the nation, and the two levels cannot be separated statistically. We believe that the conceptual advantages and statistical parsi- mony of the diagonal reference models outweigh this small statistical disadvantage.</page><page sequence="11">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 649 parents' church attendance: Here al to a5 (the shaded cells) represent the average religios- ity of each consistent ideal-typical cell. The implication for the religiosity of a person in an inconsistent cell, for example someone in a religious nation who has secular parents (upper left-hand corner), is a weighted aver- age of the religiosity of two consistent cells-those living in a religious nation and having devout parents (a5), and those living in a secular nation and having secular par- ents (a,). Formally, the diagonal reference model can be written: = wai + (1-w)aj + Ejk; where i =1,2,3,4,5; j = 1,2,3,4,5; k =1,. .. ., N; and 0&lt;w&lt;1. (1) In equation 1, Yijk represents the dependent variable, the intensity of religious belief of respondent k; i represents the religiosity of the nation; and j represents parents' church attendance. There is one parameter a for each diagonal cell, which represents the expected mean degree of religious belief of respon- dents within consistent combinations of pa- rental church attendance and national religi- osity. Parameters w and (1-w) are weights that indicate the relative importance of pa- rental church attendance and national reli- gious context respectively on respondent's religious beliefs. Eijk is a stochastic error term with an expected value of 0. One advantage of the model is that it makes no assumption about the linearity of the association. A diagonal reference model with co- variates in addition to the main variables can be written as: Yijk = wai+ (1-w)a + , 3mX +E (2) For each covariate Xm we estimate a beta pa- rameter Pm. There are, therefore, m co- variates and m beta parameters. This equa- tion describes Model A (with covariates for age, gender, education, Catholic, non-Chris- tian, previous Communist society, GNP, and a dummy for the United States), which ex- plains 35 percent of the variance. Table 4 presents the goodness-of-fit statistics for Model A and the other models. Model B relaxes the restriction that the weight parameters be the same for each level of national religiosity and gives a more flexible model: w = p+ dl(row2) +d2(row3)+ d3(row4)+ d5(row5). (3) Substituting equation 3 into equation 2 gives the equation for Model B with five weight coefficients, one for each religiosity level: p is the reference parameter for a secular na- tion (row 1); p + d, is the weight for row 2; p + d2 is the weight for row 3; and so forth. Weights for parental church attendance, 1-w, decline conversely. This model, which ex- plains 36 percent of the variance, leads to a substantial improvement in fit compared to baseline Model A (x2 =193.3, d.f. = 4). The BIC criterion (Raftery 1986) also suggests an improvement in fit. Finally, because the weight coefficients for rows 2 and 3, and for rows 4 and 5 are al- most equal, we put an extra restriction on the weights to create Model C: w = p + dI (row2,3) + d2(row4,5)* (4) In Model C, the nation weight is p for people living in a secular nation (row 1). The weight increases by d1 for people living in a nation of intermediate religiosity (rows 2 and 3), while the parental weight (1-w) decreases by dj. The same logic holds for d2 for religious nations (rows 4 and 5). Model C fits almost as well as Model B, but it is more parsimoni- ous. The BIC criterion also suggests that it is preferable to Model B. Alternative Models The relative weights of national religiosity and of parental church attendance may also vary between Catholics and Protestants (We- ber [1921] 1972), between old and young, between men and women, between the well- educated and the poorly educated, between formerly Communist nations and other na- tions, or between rich nations and poor na- tions. To test these possibilities, in Model D we allow a dichotomous variable (e.g., Catholic background) to interact with the weight parameters: W = p + dl (roW2,3) + d2 (row4,5) +d3(parent Catholic).

(1) Clearly, parental religiosity matters greatly: People with devout parents are far more likely to ac- quire orthodox beliefs than are those with secular parents. (2) People born into religious societies are much more likely to hold ortho- dox religious beliefs than are those born into secular societies. For example, people with secular parents living in secular nations (lower left-hand corner of Figure 2 and Table 5) score only 16 points on religious ortho- doxy, while those with equally secular par- ents residing in religious nations are far more orthodox, averaging 60 points (upper left cor- ner). Similarly, respondents from devout families living in secular nations (lower right corner) score 73 on religious belief while those born to equally devout families in reli- gious nations score 85 points (upper right corner).

The pattern is similar in nations with intermediate levels of religiosity.

Hence in religious nations, the difference between those from devout and those from secular families is not so large (upper right corner versus upper left corner: 85 - 60 = 25 points). Hypothesis 1: National Context A clear test of our hypotheses is provided by the multivariate results which adjust for dif- ferences among nations in modernization, the experience of Communist antireligious policies, American exceptionalism; and for differences among individuals in denomina- tion, age, sex, and education (see Tables 4 and 6, and Figures 3 and 4). After adjusting for all these differences, parents still strongly influence their offspring's religious beliefs. It is also clear that those living in religious societies are much more likely to acquire religious beliefs than are those living in secular societies- even if they are from equally devout fami- lies, live in nations at the same level of mod- ernization, are the same age, sex, and de- nomination, and have the same level of edu- cation.

(1) In relatively secular nations, na- tional context matters little or not at all (w = .06), while family background matters a lot (1-w = .94, p &lt; .001). (2) In societies of in- termediate devoutness, national context mat- ters more (w = .26, p &lt; .001), and family background matters correspondingly less (1- w = .74, p &lt; .001). (3) And in devout societ- ies, national context matters more (w = .58, p &lt; .001) than family background (1-w = .42, p &lt; .001), although family background re- mains important. These differences are sub- stantively large and statistically significant, and they offer strong support for Hypotheses 2a and 2b. The same pattern holds for both Catholics and non-Catholics, old and young, men and women, the well educated and the poorly educated, formerly communist nations and other nations, and rich nations and poorer nations (results available from the authors).7 OLS analyses for each nation separately show the same pattern (Appendix Table A). Other Aspects of Nation Modernization, as measured by the nation's GNP, slightly reduces religious orthodoxy, in conformity with modernization theory (Table 6). Compared to people living in a poor country like Poland (GNP = 21 percent of the U.S. GNP), those in a prosperous Euro- pean nation like West Germany (GNP = 76 7 Our comparison of the effect of parents' church attendance on religious orthodoxy in secu- lar and religious societies could be biased by ceil- ing effects. Religiosity is close to the maximum score in devout countries, biasing it downward, while there is little or no downward bias in secu- lar countries. However comparisons in which ceiling effects are unlikely-say the three or four most secular rows and columns of Table 5- shows the same pattern as the whole table. For example, when comparing the most secular fami- lies with those one category up, religiosity in- creases from 16 to 40 (24 points) in secular na- tions but only from 64 to 68 (4 points) in rela- tively devout nations. Applying Model C to the 4 x 4 table omitting the most religious nations and the most devout parents gives a more rigorous test which produces the same pattern as was obtained for the full sample (details available on request). We conclude that ceiling effects do not apprecia- bly bias our results. Table 6.

However, this effect (unlike others in the model) is not entirely robust: A plausible alternative model yields different results (available from the authors). Specifically, if the United States (which is both rich and devout) is not exceptional (contrary to the assumption of Model C), then an increase in GNP increases religious orthodoxy slightly. So no strong claim is warranted. Communism's persistent campaign against religion seems to have shaped people's be- liefs. People living in formerly Communist nations acquired religious beliefs 20 points less orthodox than otherwise similar people, a large and statistically significant difference (p &lt; .001). As many have argued, the United States seems to be exceptional. Americans hold be- liefs that are, on average, 19 points more or- thodox than otherwise similar people in other countries, a large and statistically significant difference (p &lt; .001). Individual Effects Denominational differences matter slightly. People from Catholic families acquire slightly less orthodox beliefs, other things being equal (1 point out of 100, p &lt; .05; Table 6). Other individual effects are small but sta- tistically significant and resemble those found in previous studies (Table 6). (1) Or- thodox beliefs increase slightly with age. Other things equal, a 70-year-old is likely to be 9 points more orthodox than a 20-year- old. If this is a cohort effect rather than a life- cycle effect, it implies a gradual decline over time in national religiosity. (2) Men are 8 points less orthodox than women, other things being equal. (3) The well-educated are a little less orthodox than the poorly edu- cated: The difference in beliefs between a university graduate and someone with only a secondary school education is about 5 points, other things being equal. CONCLUSION The religious environment of a nation has a major impact on the beliefs of its citizens: People living in religious nations acquire, in proportion to the orthodoxy of their fellow citizens, more orthodox beliefs than those living in secular nations. This is not because they come from more devout families (al- though most do), nor because religious na- tions differ from secular nations in modern- ization or exposure to Communism (although they do), nor because of differences in an individual's denomination, education, age, or sex (although such differences exist). Rather, the religious character of the nation itself matters. In some circumstances, national context is more important even than family background in shaping people's beliefs. A nation's culture and the policies of its churches and government are part of the ex- planation. But especially important, we ar- gue, is the pool of potential friends, teach- ers, work colleagues, and marriage-partners: In a religious nation this pool is mostly de- vout, and in a secular nation this pool is mostly secular-and these differences mat- ter greatly. Our findings about the impact of a nation's religious environment are consis- tent with previous research about differences between urban and rural areas, and between secular regions and devout regions within a single nation, but such differences have not previously been systematically tested on data from many nations. Our empirical results from a powerful multivariate model using comparable data from 15 nations and over 17,000 individuals offer strong evidence for such contextual effects.8 8The logic of our argument extends beyond re- ligion, suggesting that national context shapes in- dividuals' views on any attitude, value, or belief on which nations differ, and on which friends, colleagues or marriage partners influence each other. Thus, we predict that national context will influence attitudes to, among other things, poli- tics (e.g., views on unions, government owner- ship of industry, welfare provision, and inequal-</page><page sequence="17">NATIONS, PARENTS, AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF 655 Our results also clearly demonstrate that a nation's religious environment shapes the way in which religious beliefs are passed on from parent to child. In relatively secular na- tions, the religious views of secular families are reinforced. However, devout families in these societies are usually able to insulate their children from secular pressures. Hence in relatively secular nations, the effect of family religiosity on children's religiosity is strong, and the effect of national religious context is small. By contrast, in relatively re- ligious societies, devout families' views are reinforced. But secular families in such soci- eties generally do not insulate their children from religious pressures, so many acquire the beliefs of their fellow citizens. Hence, in relatively religious nations, family religios- ity is less important for children's religious views than it is in secular societies. This strong interaction between a nation's religious environment and the way in which family background influences religious be- lief has important consequences for future research. Studies on religious socialization (e.g., Hoge, Petrillo, and Smith 1982) usu- ally do not take national context into ac- count. Our results clearly show that studies that neglect the religious context of the na- tion can be misleading with respect to the importance of parental socialization. In de- vout societies like the United States, Poland, or Ireland, family religiosity effects will not be as strong. But in secular societies like much of Western Europe and most of East- ern Europe, the effect of family religiosity can be expected to be strong. If our argu- ments are correct, these apparent differences do not reflect differences in how families function in these societies, but instead reflect differences in the religious environments of the nations themselves. Our results also speak to the long-running debate about U.S. religious exceptionalism (Warner 1993): They support the view that the United States is unusually religious. Both fundamentalist beliefs in a personal god (the potential "demand" for religion) and church attendance are markedly higher in the United States. ity), social issues (e.g., feminism, divorce, sexu- ality, or abortion), and social groups (e.g., preju- dice against racial or ethnic groups). Our results do not support Stark and Iannaccone's (1994) "supply-side" analysis of differences between nations which argues that nations with religious monopolies have substantial unmet religious needs, while churches in religiously competitive nations like the United States do a better job of meet- ing diverse religious needs. This argument implies that those who do not attend church are more devout in monopolistic societies. But our results suggest the opposite: Those who do not attend church are actually more devout in religiously competitive societies like the United States and Northern Ireland. Modernization theory and related argu- ments by many (mainly European) sociolo- gists of religion predict that religious belief declines as nations become more modern. They contend that this has happened in many European nations in recent decades. But many other (mainly American) scholars dis- agree, citing the high levels of religious be- lief in the United States. Our results suggest that the answer to this argument turns on the issue of U.S. exceptionalism. If the United States is taken to be exceptional, as in our preferred model, our data suggest that mod- ernization (as measured by GNP per capita) leads to a modest but statistically significant decline in religious belief in the 14 non-U.S. nations in our analysis. But if the United States is not treated as exceptional, this one case-very high in both GNP and religious belief-tips the scales in the opposite direc- tion. In this case, modernization appears to produce a slight increase in religious belief. But the effect of modernization is not strong in either model. Our results suggest that religious beliefs endure in large part because the religious en- vironment of a nation shapes the beliefs of its citizens. Most residents of European na- tions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centu- ries-and the European immigrants who populated the New World-believed in a su- pernatural, at least vaguely anthropomorphic God who was personally concerned with in- dividual humans. They agreed on these fun- damental points, while often differing on de- nominational loyalty and specific points of doctrine. Devout parents raised mostly de- vout children, helped by the prevailing reli- gious atmosphere of the nation. Crucially, even when parental socialization failed, the</page><page sequence="18">656 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW religious atmosphere of the nation and the devout beliefs of the overwhelming majority of potential friends, teachers, colleagues, and marriage partners inculcated belief. Not until external forces like moderniza- tion, the Enlightenment, the growth of edu- cation, or the rise of science bring the aver- age levels of belief in the nation down ap- preciably do things begin to change. Our re- sults suggest that religiosity then changes rapidly-not declining slowly and gradually but dropping precipitously. The offspring of devout families mostly remain devout, but the offspring of more secular families now strongly tend to be secular. A self-reinforc- ing spiral of secularization then sets in, shift- ing the nation's average religiosity ever fur- ther away from orthodoxy. So after genera- tions of stability, religious belief declines abruptly in the course of a few generations to the modest levels seen in many Western European nations today.

He is also Professorial Associate at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Re- search, University of Melbourne, and is principal investigator of the International Survey of Eco- nomic Attitudes (ISEA) and of the International Social Science Survey. With M. D. R. Evans he is studying the ideology of inequality in 30 nations and continuing a participant-observation study of twins. With A. 0. Haller he is studying inequality in Brazil, and with Krzysztof Zagorski he is in- vestigating attitudes toward inequality and the economy during the transition from communism in Eastern Europe. Nan Dirk De Graaf is a member of the Depart- ment of Sociology, Nijmegen University, The Netherlands. He is also an associate member of Nuffield College, Oxford, England. His primary research interests are social stratification and the political and cultural consequences of social mo- bility and mixed marriages. He has been super- vising various projects supported by the Nether- lands Organization for Scientific Research. He is currently studying the decline of religious- and class-based voting, the decline of religiosity, post-industrialism and class, new consumer styles and post-materialism, nonvoting, gender inequal- ity, and the impact of the field of education on inequality.
