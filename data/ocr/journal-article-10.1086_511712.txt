G R AV E S University of Botswana The titles of many recent Milton publications—for instance, Milton Un- bound, or Arenas of Conflict: Milton and the Unfettered Mind, or Milton and Heresy—indicate an increasing willingness to explore the poet’s non- conformist radicalism with an awareness that Milton’s contradictions and uncertainties are central to the meaning of  Paradise Lost.1 The current critical vogue for Miltonists is to refrain from ironing out the uncomfortable creases in the poet’s writing, and this is particularly the case with regard to Milton’s theology. Whether it be that God has a metaphysically substantial body that experiences theopathetic emotions, or that angels actually defecate, or that the begetting of  the Son of  God is a humiliation into angelic form, critics have come to realize that such pronouncements are not “the common gloss / Of theologians” (PL, 5, 435–36),2 but are meaningful and veridical in their own right.3 The pendulum has swung a long way from several 1.

In fact, critics have either turned away puzzled or simply refused altogether to engage with many of  the convoluted and contradictory nuances of  the text.5 Perhaps the most fascinating of  these aporias is the elusive Miltonic simile. In his daring epic Milton does not only associate traditional scriptural types but also, to shocking effect, aligns paradoxically in- congruous characters. The effect is so uncomfortable that most critics have ignored or dismissed the resulting implications (“he surely didn’t mean that, did he? I can’t have understood that correctly”) and have thereby failed to perceive Milton’s subtle criticism of  traditional bib- lical exegesis—with the orthodox Trinitarian Son of God as his primary target. Milton’s destabilization of traditional biblical typology expresses his unorthodox theology and, I shall go on to argue, forms a para- digm in Milton’s critique of  the idea of  the Son as God’s coequal. Although I will draw on numerous examples from Milton’s epics, I will take Milton’s interpretation and reinscription of  the biblical Esau and Jacob as paradigmatic of  the poet’s analogical method of  questioning the divinity of  the Son of  God. What will emerge from this analysis is that Milton’s use of  appropriate biblical similes and scriptural asso- ciations in his portrayal of  Satan supports Milton’s use of  both ortho- dox and unconventional biblical typology in his portrayal of  the Son. Milton’s God is never typologically depicted and is compared to no defecation see PL, 5, 404–15, and particularly “assimilate,” PL, 5, 412; Albert C. Labriola, “ ‘Thy Humiliation shall exalt’: The Christology of Paradise Lost,” Milton Studies 15 (1981): 29–42. 4.

Compare Joseph Wittreich, “ ‘He ever was a dissenter’: Milton’s Transgressive Maneuvers in Paradise Lost,” in McColgan and Durham, Arenas of Conflict, 21–40: “some of  these conflicts inhabit Paradise Lost as vexing complexities, but others exist in the poem as glaring contradictions—a point worth insisting upon just because Milton criticism, especially of late, has been paralyzed, indeed impoverished, by the suppression of  such conflicts or just plain avoidance of  them” (36); and Rumrich’s introductory first chapter, entitled “The Invented Milton,” to Milton Unbound (1–23).

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 175 other character but his biblical original, but the poet’s surprising typological associations align the Son and Satan far more closely than has previously been noted.6 I Milton utilizes many different forms of  typology in Paradise Lost, but more prominent than the typology of providential events or institutions or places is the typology of character. In the opening line of the poem the “first disobedience” of  Adam is suspended as historical fact, para- doxically unfulfilled in its providential meaning “till one greater man / Restore us” in line 4. Adam is only fully educated in his typological role by the archangel Michael in the last books of the epic, but throughout the poem Milton utilizes character typology in his description of  the Son of  God as the antitype to Old Testament figures. He also does this—perhaps surprisingly—in his description of  Satan. In a form of pseudo-typology, Milton compares Satan to a number of Old Testament characters, most of  whom would be described as archetypal villains; the parallels and associations between the type and antitype correspond and function identically with that of orthodox Christological typology, perhaps similarly even fulfilling the latent historical sense and pro- claiming a providential view of  history. However, at times Milton also associates Satan with traditional Old Testament heroes. In order to make an orthodox interpretation of  these comparisons, critics, as we shall see, have been forced either to claim dramatic irony or to restrict the association to specific aspects. These strategies succeed in main- taining a form of  orthodox Christian biblical exegesis in the poem at the cost of  strangling literary hermeneutics.7 Why must it be decided a priori that all comparisons between Satan and biblical heroes are either ironic or severely restricted in nature? Is the only other alterna- tive to judge that the simile is irrelevant, albeit beautiful or musical or 6. Critics are only very recently starting to understand this Miltonic association and its implications for understanding the epic: “Much of  what Milton gives his God is biblical, but he makes it harder to swallow through parallels with Satan” (Neil Forsyth, The Satanic Epic [Princeton University Press, 2003], 11). Forsyth concentrates his study on the interdependency of  the roles of  Satan and the Son in the epic, and not on spe- cifically Milton’s typological analogies. 7. See also Mary Ann Radzinowicz’s investigation of the hermeneutic problems created by Miltonic associations in “Forced Allusions: Avatars of King David in the Seventeenth Century,” in Literary Milton: Text, Pretext, Context, ed. Diana Trevino Benet and Michael Lieb (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1994), 45–66: “Allusion . . . is an unstable instrument: its very liminality is as likely to result in imaginative constraint or excess as in imaginative freedom or discovered relevancy” (66). </page> <page sequence="4">                    176 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y decorative, and therefore an artistic mistake?8 This is not uncommon in epic poetry. It is seemingly the only conclusion to draw from, for instance, Wordsworth’s 1850 revision of  the association of  the Windermere ferryman with Charon in the fourth book of  The Prelude, wherein Wordsworth draws attention to the lone similarity of  their jobs as oarsmen—and thereby the inaptitude of  the allusion—by con- trasting the laconicism of  the stygian ferryman: “I did not step into the well-known boat / Without a cordial greeting” (lines 16–17).9 The answer to these hermeneutic aporias lies in a consideration of  several of  Milton’s similes and analogies for Satan in which it becomes clear that, paradoxically, it is necessary to interpret in a convoluted manner to produce an orthodox meaning, while to interpret in a herme- neutically orthodox manner results in a meaning that is theologically heterodox. During the war in heaven in Paradise Lost, book 6, Milton makes the comparison between Satan and an archetypal tyrant of  the ancient world, the Pharaoh of  Egypt. Satan and his devils have refused to be moved by the miraculous restoration of  heaven by the Son whereby “At his command the uprooted hills retired / Each to his place” (781– 82); their hearts have been hardened in their envious wickedness. Both the scene and the lexis are taken from Exodus chapter 7, wherein Pharaoh’s heart is hardened despite witnessing the miracles and signs performed by Moses and Aaron. Compare “And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of  Egypt” (Exod. 7:3) with: “But to convince the proud what signs avail, / Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? / They hardened more by what might most reclaim, / Grieving to see his glory, at the sight / Took envy” (PL, 6, 789–93). Milton expands and reinforces the Satan/Pharaoh analogy by equating the Son in the scene with Moses, and the Egyp- tian army engulfed by the Red Sea with the devils ejected through the walls of heaven. The Son’s statement to his angels, “Stand still in bright array ye saints, here stand / Ye angels armed, this day from battle rest” (801–2), is taken from Moses’s command to the Israelites in the face of Pharaoh: “Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, 8. The implied answer to this latter question is, of  course, “no.” John T. Shawcross makes a similar point in his study of  intentionality in Milton’s early poetry: “If  one assumes that Milton, though young, knew what he was doing, one should not conclude that the metaphors are decoration of  something trivial” (Intentionality and the New Tra- ditionalism [University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991], 143). 9.

The rolling back of the waters of the Red Sea and their engulfing motion in Exodus chapter 14 is mirrored by the “crystal wall of  heav’n, which op’ning wide, / Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed” (860–61), spewing out the rebel host, who are then swallowed up by hell’s yawning mouth as heaven’s walls roll back to close the breach: hell at last Yawning received them whole, and on them closed, Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of  woe and pain. Disburdened heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. (PL, 6, 874–79) Earlier in Paradise Lost Milton made the connection between Satan and Pharaoh explicit. In the complex “Vallombrosa” simile of  book 1, lines 302–13, Milton describes Satan standing before the fallen angels as being on “the Red Sea coast, whose waves o’erthrew / Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,” with “their floating carcasses / And broken chariot wheels” (306–11).10 According to Alastair Fowler’s note, Busiris was a mythic tyrant commonly identified with the Pharaoh of Exodus,11 and the scene is clearly taken from Exodus chapter 14. Indeed, this Satanic analogy is continually invoked in the poem with descriptions of  “the faint Satanic host . . . With shivered armour strewn, and on a heap / Chariot and charioteer lay overturned / And fiery foaming steeds” (6, 389–92), and with the Egyptian plagues inflicted on the devils in book 6, lines 835–38. The biblical history lesson of  book 12 offers the most prolonged description of the Israelites in relation to Pharaoh, who as “the lawless tyrant, who denies / To know their God, or message to regard, / Must be compelled by signs and judgments dire” (173–75). Pharaoh enthralls God’s people, “of guests he makes them slaves” (167), until “the sea / Swallows him with his host, but lets them pass / As on dry land between two crystal walls” (195–97), which recalls the “crystal wall of  heav’n” which ejected Satan in book 6, line 860.12 10. In Destabilizing Milton, Herman’s interpretation of this simile refuses to gloss over its uncertainties: “One could opt to construe this metaphor so as to erase the ambiguity; however, this involves willfully marginalizing important and relevant evidence to the contrary. If  by one turn of  the pivot the evil of  Hell contaminates Vallombrosa, another turn allows Vallombrosa’s positive resonances to contaminate, perhaps even ameliorate, Hell’s evil” (32). 11.

Genesis 14:22 describes the breach in the Red Sea as “the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.” </page> <page sequence="6"> 178 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y This extended and multiple analogy between Satan and Pharaoh offers no exegetical problems for the reader of  the poem. In each case the correspondences between type and antitype correlate almost exactly, both in the particular scene in which the comparison is made (obdurate in the midst of God’s miracles, crushed by the wrath of God’s retribution, etc.) and in their larger symbolic significance (tyrants; antagonists to God; enslavers of  God’s people; etc.). The association is successful both theologically and artistically. This is true for most of  the comparisons in Paradise Lost between Satan and traditional villains; they raise few exegetical dilemmas. For instance, in Satan’s con- versation with the archangel Uriel in book 3, the “false dissembler” (681) inquires after the whereabouts of  Adam in words that echo those in which Herod in Matthew 2:8 inquired after the whereabouts of  the second Adam, the baby Jesus, “That I may find him, and with secret gaze, / Or open admiration him behold” (671–72). As kings, dis- believers, dissemblers, and potential assassins, the characters and the specific scene are perfectly matched. Similarly, the extended descrip- tion of  Nimrod in book 12, drawn from Genesis chapter 10, creates clear and fitting associations with the Satan of  the poem. Nimrod spends “Long time in peace . . . Under paternal rule; till one shall rise / Of  proud ambitious heart, who not content / With fair equality, fraternal state,” will “refuse / Subjection to his empire tyrannous” and “with a crew, whom like ambition joins” will end up at “the mouth of hell” (23–62). Not only is this description of  Nimrod unmistakably reminiscent of  Satan’s rebellion dramatized in the poem, but also Milton’s unbiblical conflation of  Nimrod and the Tower of  Babel re- inforces this reading, since it recalls the Satanic building of  Pande- monium in book 1 and God’s punishment of  the Pandemonium devils in book 10, lines 504–77. In The Bible in Milton’s Epics, James H. Sims studies Milton’s use of biblical similes, analogies, and allusions and remarks that “in Paradise Lost Milton provides glimpses of the various facets of Satan’s character by having the language used either by or about Satan associate him with familiar villains of  the Bible.”13 Some of  these associations are merely faint echoes, discernible but subtle, such as that of  Satan with Nebuchadnezzar in Paradise Lost, book 1, lines 570–73, from Daniel 5:20, while others are clear and uncontroversial. The most interesting biblical villain that Sims sees alluded to by Satan’s words is Esau, and indeed the association is so close as to be undeniable: “profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of  meat sold his birthright. For ye know 13. James H. Sims, The Bible in Milton’s Epics (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 1962), 172. One Line Long </page> <page sequence="7"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 179 how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it care- fully with tears” (Heb. 12:16–17);14 “Oh then at last relent: is there no place / Left for repentance, none for pardon left? / None left but by submission” (PL, 4, 79–81). The passage from Hebrews is a New Testament interpretation of the original story from Genesis, chapters 25–27, wherein the starving Esau sells his birthright to his opportunistic brother Jacob for a meal and is then further robbed of  his father Isaac’s blessing by the conniv- ing Jacob, who wears a disguise to trick his decrepit parent. Although in the original story Esau seems by far the moral superior of Jacob, and recent theologians have analyzed the reasons for this,15 yet the New Testament interpretation of  the story firmly establishes Esau as the villain who, overcome with pride, rejects remorse and refuses to submit to God. Accordingly Esau is a fitting type for the Miltonic Satan, who toys with repentance in his soliloquy on Mount Niphates only to reinforce his opposition to God. As Sims correctly notes, Satan’s “sorrow, like Esau’s, is a self-pitying sorrow which is concerned not with his sin but with his loss.”16 Since Esau is a traditional biblical villain, the association with Satan is entirely fitting both in this particular scene and in general, and the allusion is explained to the reader’s full satisfaction. However, Milton also presents biblical allusions that associate Satan with traditionally “good” or heroic characters. This raises numerous theological problems, which in turn lead one to question the degree of  artistic success achieved by Milton’s use of  typology. Milton com- pares Satan to revered patriarchs such as Moses and Jacob and to famous heroes such as David, all of  whom are traditional types of Christ. Critics have been puzzled as to how to interpret these allusions and similes and have resorted to two modes of  interpretation that, ironically, contradict each other. Most critics, as I have already noted, have cited dramatic irony17 and have interpreted the allusion as a 14. Milton quotes this passage from Hebrews in Eikonoklastes (CPW, 3, 554) as an example of  repentance that fails to achieve forgiveness; other examples include obvious biblical villains such as Cain, Pharaoh, and Judas. 15. See Johanna Stiebert, “The Maligned Patriarch: Prophetic Ideology and the ‘Bad Press’ of  Esau,” in Sense and Sensitivity: Essays on Reading the Bible in Memory of Robert Carroll, ed. A. G.

Dramatic irony in this context of  biblical allusion is defined by Sims in The Bible in Milton’s Epics: “An effect of  dramatic irony is achieved through the use of  language from a biblical context which carries connotations different from, at times even opposed to, the suggestions of  the speaker whose speech includes the Biblical allusion” (155). </page> <page sequence="8"> 180 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y false comparison between the two characters that serves to condemn or criticize Satan by the ironic contrast between good and bad, believer and unbeliever, obedience and disobedience, and so on. However, some other critics, sensitive to certain artistic problems that this hermeneutic mode presents, have instead interpreted the relationship between type and antitype as a restricted comparison, substituting a limited identity for an ironic disparity. These interpretations are contra- dictory, and the reader must choose between them, which suggests that neither mode is fully satisfactory and that a different hermeneutic method might make more sense of  these allusions. The clearest example of  a direct comparison between Satan and a famous biblical hero and traditional type is the simile associating Satan at the gate of  heaven with Jacob and his dream ladder. Consid- ering the confusion it has caused critics, the passage is worth quoting at length: The stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of  Luz, Dreaming by night under the open sky, And waking cried, This is the gate of heaven. Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There always, but drawn up to heaven sometimes Viewless . . . The stairs were then let down, whether to dare The fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the doors of  bliss. (PL, 3, 510–25) In this extended simile, six lines are devoted to Jacob and further lines to his dream, suggesting Milton’s considerable interest in the topic. Indeed the scene expands and is explained through line 542, describ- ing Satan’s behavior and God’s rationale for lowering Jacob’s stairs. Christopher Ricks in Milton’s Grand Style makes a rare analysis of  this passage, noting an idea first suggested by Thomas De Quincey that “Milton does sometimes use similes and allusions with a clear sense of the fact that they don’t fit exactly, that he does sometimes use an un- likeness between the things compared.”18 Ricks argues that Milton must 18. Christopher Ricks, Milton’s Grand Style (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963), 127. Eighteenth-century editors of  Milton’s epic poetry like Zachary Pearce have noted the lack of  precision in Miltonic similes as they expand and develop: “Milton in his Simili- tudes (as is the practice of  Homer and Virgil too) after he has shown the common re- semblance, often takes the liberty of  wandering into some unresembling Circumstances” One Line Long </page> <page sequence="9"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 181 be interested in the disparities between the figures of Satan and Jacob, for otherwise “we ought to deprecate the passage (however beautiful), since it would seem to suggest either that Satan was good, or that Jacob was bad.” His conclusion is that Milton is suggesting an ironic con- trast between the two characters who yet find themselves in similar situations, for both are presented with a palpable means of repentance, but the effects are vastly different between the arch-enemy of God and what Yahweh calls his “chosen hand.”19 Initial surprising similarity is converted to overwhelming (and orthodox) dissimilarity. Ricks in- terprets the passage as ironic, since the only other option is to accept artistic failure: “The length and power of  the allusion forces us to choose between damaging irrelevance, or likeness turning grimly into disparity.”20 The problem with this hermeneutic method, as Ricks himself  notes but fails to counter, is that it is worryingly a priori. If  the allusion com- pares Satan to a traditional villain then the relationship must be that of  similarity, whereas if  the comparison is to Satan and a typical hero then the meaning must be that of  ironic difference. The price of  safe- guarding theological orthodoxy is denying hermeneutic freedom. As Ricks puts it, “The trouble here is obvious: that we now have to hand a gambit like ‘heads I win, tails you lose.’ If  a simile does turn out to be relevant, then that is good; and if  it turns out not to be, then that is good too, since it is ‘ironic disparity.’ ”21 One attempt to escape this dilemma is to replace ironic disparity with restricted comparison, as (quoted in William Empson, Some Versions of Pastoral, 3rd impression [London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1968], 170). A. D. Nuttall discusses the Miltonic simile in terms of  Homeric digression or Virgilian homologation in The Alternative Trinity (Oxford: Clarendon, 1998), 71–86. Linda Gregerson has argued in “The Limbs of  Truth: Milton’s Use of Simile in Paradise Lost” (Milton Studies 14 [1980]: 135–52) that “disjunctions are built into the figurative text to remind us of  the space [between vehicle and tenor], and our dependence” (148). 19. Milton describes Jacob as “patriarcha Iacobus” in Columbia, 15:248. Jacob has traditionally been regarded as a type of  Christ: see the general index to the Patrologia Latina, ed. J.-P. Migne (1844 sqq.), 221:984. 20. Ricks, Milton’s Grand Style, 128. Keith W. F. Stavely agrees that “one obvious way to read the present passage is as an ironic foretelling of  the defeat of  Satan’s designs by divine providence, in the unfolding of  which the story of  Jacob and Esau was to be an early episode” (“Satan and Arminianism in Paradise Lost,” Milton Studies 25 [1989]: 130). Lucy Newlyn is the first critic to reverse Ricks’s parameters and “to see disparity turn- ing suggestively into likeness” in the comparison of  Satan to Jacob, taking seriously the idea that Milton intended a deliberate congruity to be perceived: “Jacob, too, is morally ambiguous—not above deception himself  . . . [Milton] is also compelled by the thought of  Satan and Jacob becoming one” (Paradise Lost and the Romantic Reader [Oxford: Clarendon, 1993], 65, 81). However, Newlyn does not elaborate in any detail what this similitude is. See also Herman, Destabilizing Milton, 186, n. 8. 21. Ricks, Milton’s Grand Style, 127. </page> <page sequence="10"> 182 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y Fowler does in his annotation to the passage. Fowler refutes Ricks’s claim that this is a disjunctive simile, instead positing that “like Jacob, Satan fleeing judgment has reached a parting of  the ways set up by providential anticipation of the Fall.”22 However, no critic would deny this similarity, and Fowler is still forced to concede the equally obvious dissimilarity that Satan, unlike Jacob, chooses not to repent, and Fowler has to ignore the other potentially damaging problems of  associating Satan with Jacob. Mindele Anne Treip states—I think correctly—that the simile has never been satisfactorily explained, yet she argues, without full explanation, that Ricks and Fowler are both correct.23 How invok- ing both ironic disparity and restricted comparison at the same time can produce a unified and satisfying interpretation is unclear, and the passage remains puzzling. Analogies between Satan and other Old Testament patriarchs and heroes repeat these problems. In book 1 Milton uses an epic simile to compare Satan raising the fallen devils from the lake of fire in hell with Moses raising the plague of  locusts in Exodus 10:12–15: As when the potent rod Of Amram’s son in Egypt’s evil day Waved round the coast, up called a pitchy cloud Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, That o’er the realm of  impious Pharaoh hung Like night, and darkened all the land of  Nile: So numberless were those bad angels seen Hovering on wing under the cope of  hell ’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires. (PL, 1, 338–46) Conventionally, this simile is explained by critics referring to the familiar allegorization of  devils to locusts made by many theologians about Exodus 10:12–15 and authorized by Revelation 9:3–11. How- ever, it is the association of  Satan with Moses (and the concomitant 22. Fowler, Milton: Paradise Lost, 198, nn. 510–15. 23. Mindele Anne Treip, “ ‘Reason is also choice’: The Emblematics of  Free Will in Paradise Lost,” Studies in English Literature 31 (1991): 177, n. 61. Claes Schaar in The Full Voic’d Quire Below: Vertical Context Systems in “Paradise Lost,” Lund Studies in English 60 (Lund: Gleerup, 1982), argues that Ricks’s disparities outweigh Fowler’s resemblances, for “it is not only true that Satan, unlike Jacob, ‘will go on to choose deeper damnation’— he has already chosen it, and it is no more possible for a rebel against the power of God to repent at this stage than it is in Eden before the temptation of  Eve” (157). However, such a reading seems doubtful in the light of Milton’s Arminianism dramatized in Satan’s multiple flirtations with repentance. See Stavely, “Satan and Arminianism in Paradise Lost,” 125–39. </page> <page sequence="11"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 183 association of  “impious Pharaoh” with Milton’s God), and not that of devils with locusts, that is most troubling, although Forsyth notes that “the discrepancy between simile and narrative is as striking as the parallel” regarding this whole scene.24 Fowler’s annotation describes the passage as “a difficult simile . . . [a] complex travesty of Moses” but does not explain what this means, while Shawcross fails altogether to appreciate the analogy between Moses and Satan and instead makes the surprising observation that the reference to “Amram’s son . . . underscores the subordinationism of  not only the Son to the Father but of Eve to Adam.”25 Clearly there must be some similarities between Moses and Satan for the simile to function at all, but they are severely limited. Indeed, I can name only two: both characters are leaders, and both raise a huge number of flying creatures into desolate realms ruled by Kings. Even “the uplifted spear / Of  their great sultan” (1, 347–48) is an inexact similitude to Moses’s rod. The focus of Milton’s epic to this point has inarguably been Satan and his behavior and not the fallen angels, and so one cannot simply explain away the association of Satan/ Moses by concentrating on devils/locusts. Is the simile a restricted com- parison that functions by invoking the limited resemblances we have noted, while yet uncomfortably ignoring the overwhelming differences and the larger theological problem of any Satan/patriarch comparison? Or is it meant to be understood as an ironic disparity that seeks to infer the immense contrasts between Moses and Satan to the detriment of the latter—a hermeneutic strategy that we have seen to be highly ques- tionable?26 This dilemma is merely complicated by reference to further Miltonic associations of  Satan with Moses. In book 10, line 369, Satan “empowers” Sin and Death to lead the journey to the Promised Land, “right down to Paradise” (398), with the command “No detriment need fear, go and be strong” (409), repeating Moses’s empowerment of Joshua to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land in Deuteronomy 24. “The devils escape the burning marl and . . . are immediately compared to a cloud of  locusts. . . . these are biblical locusts, the ones summoned by Moses to descend on the Pharaoh and his people in Exodus 10:12–15, and once again Milton’s narrative takes a different course from the Bible” (Forsyth, The Satanic Epic, 102). 25.

Ricks argues that the allusion must be interpreted in this way for it to make any sense at all but concedes that “we must remember that we have here a dangerously useful weapon” in using ironic disparity as an exegetic tool: “Is it possible then to think that Milton was not making deliberate use, not only of  the similarity of  Satan and Moses at this point, but also of  the hideous differences between them?” (Milton’s Grand Style, 129). </page> <page sequence="12"> 184 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y 31:6–7: “Be strong and of  a good courage, fear not . . . Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land.”27 Equally confusing is the forceful analogy made by Milton in book 1 between Satan and David. The dramatic scene presents Satan reviewing his army in full battle array and proudly counting his host of warriors in defiance of  God; in 1 Chronicles 21, King David is provoked by Satan himself  to number the Israelite race against the advice of  the prophet Joab, who warns against this proud denial of  God’s divine control: “Their order due, / Their visages and stature as of gods, / Their number last he sums. And now his heart / Distends with pride, and hardening in his strength / Glories” (PL, 1, 569–73); “And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. . . . And Joab gave the sum of  the number of  the people unto David. . . . And God was dis- pleased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel” (1 Chron. 21:1, 5, 7). On the one hand the analogy seems fully justified and fitting: David’s hubristic act of numbering God’s people is closely paralleled to Satan’s act of counting his followers in whom he takes self-reliant pride. How- ever, a huge disparity is also evident, not only in the specifics of  the comparison, wherein David repents of  his crime vis-à-vis Satan who becomes further entrenched in his sin, but also in the larger context of comparing one of the most frequent types of Christ to the arch-enemy of  God. The comparison is made more incongruous by the fact that in the biblical account it is Satan who tempts David to sin, thus further confusing any simple identification of  David with the devil. Sims in- terprets the passage by concluding that “the suggestion of the Biblical allusion is that Satan, like David who was punished for numbering his people in pride . . . will fall the harder in defeat the more he exalts him- self.”28 This is to make a restricted comparison, and Sims ignores the problems with this reading, namely, that although David is punished, God himself  actually “repented him of  the evil” (1 Chron. 21:15), and that David also repents and learns from this mistake and, in a para- doxical biblical sense, good results from bad. This is not the case for Milton’s Satan, which suggests that Sims is wrong and the analogy is meant to be one of  ironic disparity: David and Satan’s hubris are com- pared in order to reveal the irrevocably hardened heart of  the latter and God’s just punishment of him. However, while this reading is theo- 27. Samuel S. Stollman argues that Milton’s “infernal trinity” is a parody of  Moses as the type of the Old Testament liberator, mediator, and lawgiver. According to the premise of  this reading, Moses and Satan could then be interpreted as mutually pernicious—the patriarch representing the inevitable condemnation by the Mosaic Law (“Satan, Sin, and Death: A Mosaic Trio in Paradise Lost,” Milton Studies 22 [1986]: 101–20). 28.

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 185 logically orthodox, it falls into Ricks’s conundrum of  “Heads I win, tails you lose”: in order to safeguard the allusion from artistic failure when the reader discovers that the comparison does not perfectly func- tion, he must decide that it is ironically disparate, and then everyone is a winner. The idea that there are more fundamental resemblances between Satan and David must be rejected a priori. I I Equivalent to these biblical allusions comparing Satan with both traditional villains and heroes is Milton’s deliberate association of  the Son of  God with both Old Testament heroes and villains. The former is standard typological practice; the latter highly unorthodox, at least superficially. Nothing could be more standard in a Christian poem drawing most of  its source material from the Old Testament than that it should utilize typological comparisons between the Son and Israelite patriarchs and heroes. In the opening presentation of God and the Son in Paradise Lost book 3, both the form and substance of  the “debate” that occurs is drawn from three related accounts in the Pentateuch— between God and Abraham in Genesis chapter 18, and between God and Moses in Exodus chapter 32 and Numbers chapter 14.29 In the Genesis account, God declares that Sodom must be utterly destroyed on account of  its wicked inhabitants, but Abraham jostles with God, arguing eventually successfully that if  even ten righteous men be found in the city it would not be just for God to destroy them. In the Authorized version, the parallels between the words of  Abraham and those of  Milton’s Son are evident: “That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of  all the earth do right?” (Gen. 18:25); “For should man finally be lost, should man / Thy creature late so loved, thy youngest son / Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joined / With his own folly? 29. This has been noted by many critics dating back to Thomas Newton in his 1749 edition of  Paradise Lost. See John E. Parish, “Milton and an Anthropomorphic God,” Studies in Philology 56 (1959): 619–25; Merritt Y. Hughes, “The Filiations of  Milton’s Celestial Dialogue,” in Ten Perspectives on Milton (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1965), 104–35; Hugh R.

Similarly, in the two separate biblical “debates” between Moses and God, the substance of  the argument is identical to that conducted by Milton’s Son. In Exodus 32:7–14, Moses persuades God not to destroy the sinful Israelites on account of  their idolatry of  the Golden Calf, arguing that both the breaking of  His past promises to the Israelite leaders and the consequent taunts of the old Egyptian overlords would be unpropitious to the honor of the Lord. In Numbers 14:13–16, God announces that he will destroy the Israelites for their refusal to enter the Promised Land, but Moses persuades God to lessen the sentence, arguing in a similar vein that God would be discredited in the eyes of His enemies if  He were to destroy His own people. This is exactly the argument Milton places in the Son’s mouth in book 3, lines 156–66: “shall the adversary thus obtain / His end, and frustrate thine, / . . . So should thy goodness and thy greatness both / Be questioned and blasphemed without defence.” I have already noted further associations of  the Son with Moses in the context of  the War in Heaven and his fight with the Satanic Pharaoh of  Egypt, and in all these Mosaic and Abrahamic allusions the typological reference identifies the Son with humanitarian intercessions by biblical heroes, and with a mind also for safeguarding God’s wider reputation.30 As one would expect, Milton naturally makes extensive use of  New Testament accounts of  Christ in his depiction of  the Son/Christ in Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained.31 More interestingly, Milton’s Son repeats the famous typological lines of David from Psalm 16:10, “Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave” (PL, 3, 247), and the “one sling / Of  thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son” (PL, 10, 633–34) recalls both the lexis of  1 Samuel 25:29 referring to the destruction of all God’s enemies, and to the defeat of  Goliath (typologically Satan/ Sin/Death) by David in 1 Samuel 17:49–50. The archangel Michael in Paradise Lost, books 11 and 12, teaches Adam history “by types / And shadows” (12, 232–33), making overt and covert typological analogies between the Son as Christ and a progressive chronological line of Penta- teuchal heroes from Adam through Noah to Abraham and beyond. Milton’s Adam stands on a hill in Eden, recalling the mountain “Whereon for different cause the tempter set / Our second Adam” (11, 382–83), and the last three hundred lines of  this book insistently 30. See also Paradise Lost, book 12, lines 239–44 for an explicit statement of  Moses as a type of  Christ. 31. See Sims, The Bible in Milton’s Epics, 186–200. </page> <page sequence="15"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 187 and repeatedly allude to Noah as a type of  Christ.32 Noah is “The one just man alive” (818), and “all shall turn degenerate, all depraved. . . . One man except, the only son of  light” (806–8), who “to them preached / Conversion and repentance, as to souls / In prison under judgments imminent” (723–25). The Miltonic Adam rejoices because of Noah, the “one man found so perfect and so just, / That God vouch- safes to raise another world / From him, and all his anger to forget” (876–78). The typological history lesson continues to Abraham, “A nation from one faithful man to spring” (12, 113), through to “Joshua whom the gentiles Jesus call, / His name and office bearing” (310–11), not forgetting the reference to Jacob, the grandchild of Abraham, who is “Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown” (154). Milton’s association of  the Son of  God with Old Testament heroes is authorized by the typological hermeneutics undertaken by the writers of the New Testament, but surprisingly both of Milton’s epics also make comparisons of  the Son/Christ to traditional Old Testament villains. While this may at first seem disturbing, the reader can immediately differentiate between those allusions made by characters in the poem and those made by the narrator himself. The characters who associate the Son or Christ with traditional biblical villains are all Satanic, and so it is possible for the reader to reject these as fallacious. In Paradise Lost book 2, the devil Belial counsels the fallen angels not to incense further the vengeful Deity, reminding them of  God’s power to inflict pain and punishment: “What if  the breath that kindled those grim fires / Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage / And plunge us in the flames?” (170–72). The biblical reference is to Daniel 3:19 and the furnace heated up seven times hotter than is customary by the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy God’s faithful servants, and Belial’s association of  God (or the Son, who performs God’s actions) with the tyrant Nebuchadnezzar can be interpreted as an ironic Satanic inversion. An orthodox interpretation of  this biblical allusion would suggest that it is a false comparison between God and Nebuchadnezzar, yet it remains questionable whether this is the correct reading. Similarly, in Paradise Regained Satan in a conversation with Christ compares the latter to Saul and refers to the incident in 1 Samuel 9:20 wherein the immature Saul is anointed as King by the prophet Samuel while out searching for his father’s asses: “The wisest, un- experienced, will be ever / Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, / 32. See Don Cameron Allen, The Legend of Noah: Renaissance Rationalism in Art, Science, and Letters (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949), 154: “It may be that Milton found the story of  Noah more artistically attractive; and moreover it was always considered one of  the best allegorical adumbrations of  the life and ministry of  Christ.” </page> <page sequence="16"> 188 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y (As he who seeking asses found a kingdom) / Irresolute, unhardy, un- adventurous” (3, 240–42). It is also possible to reject as fallacious this Satanic association of  Christ with Saul—the King that God rejects and replaces—but there is nothing in the text itself  to suggest that the com- parison must be false. In Paradise Regained this strategy by Satan of comparing Christ to Old Testament characters is, according to Barbara Lewalski, a major test for Christ whose progression “to full self  knowl- edge in this poem depends upon his becoming a skilled typologist.”33 However, far more problematic are the instances when the narrator of  Paradise Lost makes allusions that equate the Son of  God with tra- ditional villains. These associations are typically subtle, and indeed this has allowed critics generally speaking to ignore them. The Satan/ Jacob simile of  book 3, lines 510–15, details how Jacob “from Esau fled / To Padan-Aram in the field of  Luz,”34 and this unquestionably associates Esau with Milton’s Son. This important association has gone unremarked by Milton critics.35 If  the simile was intended merely to compare Jacob’s ladder to Satan’s, then there would be no need for this piece.36 Its inclusion forces a comparison not only between the flight of  Jacob, who is guilty of  treachery to his brother, and the flight of Satan, who has also attempted to usurp his “brother’s” birthright,37 33. Barbara Lewalski précised this argument of  her own book, Milton’s Brief Epic: The Genre, Meaning, and Art of “Paradise Regained” (Providence, RI: Brown University Press, 1966), chaps. 7–12, accordingly: “Satan’s strategy throughout the temptation is to present Christ with false, inadequate, or less perfect types of  himself  and his roles . . . as substitutes for certain major types to whom Christ relates himself. . . . Then, much more subtly, Satan urges Christ to repeat the actions and experiences of these same major types, literally and exactly. Christ’s hard intellectual task is to discriminate between greater and lesser types, and then to recognize that he must not only recapitulate the major types but must do so forma perfector” (quoted in “Typological Symbolism and the ‘Progress of the Soul’ in Seventeenth-Century Literature,” in Literary Uses of Typology: From the Late Middle Ages to the Present, ed. Earl Minor [Princeton University Press, 1977], 105). 34. It may also be pertinent that Milton chooses to name this place after its original pagan name, Luz, rather than its holy name granted by Jacob to commemorate the revelation: Bethel. 35. Even critics who have made a rare close examination of  the passage have failed to recognize this clear equation. See, e.g., Stavely, “Satan and Arminianism”: “The one brother a liar, the other a warrior. Milton’s comparison between this Old Testament se- quence and Satan’s own story is beginning to seem singularly appropriate, for between them Jacob and Esau encompass the two aspects of  Satan’s fallenness” (129). 36. Compare Stephen Fallon’s analysis of Milton’s careful control of the Bellerophon allusion in Paradise Lost, book 7, lines 12–20: “Intention and Its Limits in Paradise Lost: The Case of  Bellerophon” in Benet and Lieb, Literary Milton, 161–79. 37. Labriola argues that “the Son ‘really’ becomes an Angel in Book V, for the two begettings—the first in eternity, the second in time—show the continuing humiliation of the deity, first as an angel, then as a man” (“Thy Humiliation shall exalt,” 33). </page> <page sequence="17"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 189 but between the pursuer Esau, the powerful warrior who has been greatly wronged and has chased Jacob out of  his homeland by force of arms in Genesis 27:41–45, and the victorious and personally injured Son of  God who has pursued Satan out of  his father’s realm into the wilderness: “not you but me they have despised, / Yet envied; against me is all their rage” (PL, 6, 812–13). The simile functions not only because of  the analogy of  stairs, but also because of  the mutual flight of  Jacob/Satan from the wrath of  the morally wronged elder brother Esau/Son. Indeed, and ironically, this most perplexing and unexplained simile actually operates far more successfully as a literary trope than most of  the lauded Miltonic similes and allusions considered above. As Milton’s Romantic critics famously suggested in a different context, the modern reader is led to wonder if  Milton is more successful artis- tically when his material is heterodox or Satanic. A second, more allusive biblical association between the Son and an archetypal villain develops paradoxically from a “straight” allusion I have already discussed—the Son and Moses. At the climax of the War in Heaven in book 6, the Son takes command of  the angelic legions with the words, “Stand still in bright array ye saints” (801)—the injunction of  Moses to the Israelites as they face the Egyptian Pharaoh and his army at the parting of  the Red Sea in Exodus 14:13. This establishes not only the specific typological associations of  the obedient Son and Moses, the passive angels and the Israelites, the rebellious Satan and Pharaoh, and the defeat of the devils and Egyptians, but also the whole context of  the Red Sea destruction of  God’s enemy in Exodus 14:5– 30 with that of  the Satanic army in Paradise Lost book 6, lines 824–66. This association is further suggested by the parting of  heaven’s walls, which recalls the parting of  the Red Sea, as I have noted above, and the earlier explicit identification of Satan with Pharaoh in the “Vallom- brosa” simile. However, having deliberately specified this Moses/Son allusion, Milton then reverses his parameters: suddenly and shock- ingly, it is now the Son who is the wrathful pursuer seeking vengeance, driving the war chariot, the great symbol of Egyptian military strength, and who chases a fleeing people through the parting walls. Notwith- standing the source of  Messiah’s chariot in Ezekiel chapters 1 and 10 and Michael Lieb’s study of  it,38 the chariot is unmistakably and insis- tently associated with the Egyptian Pharaoh in this context, being mentioned no less than ten times in the twenty-five verses of the battle in Exodus. The description of  the Son as “full of  wrath bent on his 38.

Of  course Milton has previously compared Satan to Moses in the raising of  the locusts/devils simile in book 1, lines 338–46, and again in book 10, line 409, so this comparison of  Moses and the Israelites fleeing Pharaoh to Satan and the devils fleeing the Son is not unprepared. As we have seen with most of  Milton’s biblical allusions and similes, the associations are rarely exact, and sometimes barely function at all. I am not contending that this similitude is a perfect fit, for obviously, as Milton’s narrative continues, the chario- teer Son is triumphant and the fleeing army defeated. However, the associations that Milton deliberately raises persist and exist in their reversed allegiances in this scene; they certainly function in a way comparable to the traditional interpretations made by critics of  the Satan/Jacob simile, or the Satan/Moses locust simile with which Milton puzzles his readers. I I I As I have shown, the reader encountering these biblical allusions is faced with an exegetical aporia. But there is an alternative to the procedure of  safeguarding an orthodox Christian interpretation by utilizing problematic modes of  interpretation. Is it possible that Milton really does mean what he says? The price of  safeguarding theological orthodoxy is hermeneutic strangulation, but it is possible to invert these terms to provide a more satisfying interpretation. This is what Milton seems to be suggesting in certain instances, if  the reader is brave enough to believe him. It is possible that many of  the biblical allusions we have considered are not restricted or ironic in nature, but are in fact fully intended comparisons. The associations may not 39. In a different context, Joel Slotkin argues that the Son’s chariot “embod[ies] the paradoxical duality of  divine power . . . the close links between the divine and the monstrous,” noting that even Milton’s earliest contemporary readers such as Samuel Barrow in his companion poem to the 1674 edition of  Paradise Lost understood the reversal of  traditional qualities: “Barrow’s description of  Satan in arms is heroic; it is the Son’s chariot that is horrible” (“Poetic Justice: Divine Punishment and Augustinian Chiaroscuro in Paradise Lost,” Milton Quarterly 38 [2004]: 113, 107).

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 191 always be theologically orthodox, but nor is angelic defecation nor a material and passible deity. Utilizing a conventional method of  in- terpreting biblical allusions as extended comparisons removes the aesthetic dilemmas we have perceived above. I am not suggesting that this is in all cases the best interpretation; there are certainly instances in Paradise Lost where a comparison between Satan and a biblical hero, or between Milton’s Satan and his Son of  God, is seemingly intended to demonstrate a deliberate Satanic travesty of  an orthodox original. Consider, for instance, Sin’s words to Satan, “O Father, what intends thy hand, she cried, / Against thy only son?” (PL, 2, 727–28)—an ob- vious perverse parody of  the sacrifice of  Isaac by Abraham in Genesis chapter 22 and of  Christ by God;40 or Sin and Death “Hovering upon the waters” (10, 285) in imitation of  the Holy Spirit in Paradise Lost, book 7, lines 234–35, and Genesis 1:2. But now that most critics are coming to recognize Milton’s doctrinal heterodoxy, it is time to accept Milton at his word in some of  his more challenging biblical similes and allusions.41 So, yet once more, I return to the confusing simile of  Satan and Jacob. Freed from the a priori restraint of  forcing the interpreta- tion to be theologically orthodox, a close inspection reveals that the associations between the two pairs of  characters and their specific situations are stunningly similar. No one doubts the similarities between Jacob’s stairs and Satan’s as a practical and symbolic means of  repentance, or the similarities between their current situations of fleeing retribution and judgment and being at a crossroads where forgiveness is offered by God. However, the Miltonic story of  Satan dramatized in the poem, and the history of  Jacob in Genesis chapters 25–28 and 32–33, are paralleled at many other points, and so too is the contextual description of  Esau in the simile with that of  Milton’s Son. The Genesis account tells how Isaac bore two sons, Esau followed by the younger son Jacob. Jacob’s name means “supplanter” or “tripper” 40. See Joseph A. Galdon, Typology and Seventeenth-Century Literature (The Hague: Mouton, 1975), 15: “Steeped in this typological way of  thinking and looking at Scripture, the Seventeenth Century reader would naturally have read the story of  Isaac in terms of  Christ’s sacrifice on the cross.” 41. Several recent Milton publications are making this their explicit aim: see the introduction to Milton and Heresy: “twentieth-century scholars have often understated, explained away, or otherwise soft-pedaled his [Milton’s] heretical beliefs. . . . We believe that this book appears at an important moment in Milton studies: as the dispute over de doctrina illustrates, the persistent desire to present Milton as an orthodox Christian threatens to undermine critical accomplishments of  the past half  century” (Dobranski and Rumrich, 1, 12). </page> <page sequence="20"> 192 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y in Hebrew (Gen. 27:36).42 Even at their birth Jacob competed with the stronger and elder Esau—catching his heel as they were born in turn43—and, as they matured, Esau became the strong man of  action and his father’s favorite, while Jacob sulked in his mother’s skirts and plotted against his sibling. The whole theme of  the Genesis story, according to The Oxford Bible Commentary, is the immoral behavior of Jacob: “The theme is Jacob’s trickery by which he obtains the paternal blessing that would normally be given to the elder son and the con- sequent implacable hatred of  Esau for his brother which makes it necessary for Jacob to leave home and set out on his travels.”44 This culminates in Genesis 25:29–34, when Esau, returning from hunting and literally dying with hunger, is blackmailed into selling his birth- right to Jacob in return for food. Genesis chapter 27 tells of how Isaac promises his blessing to Esau, but Jacob overhears his father’s intention and with his mother’s help disguises himself  as Esau and deceives the senile parent about his identity, thus obtaining the all-important blessing as God’s anointed. Finally, after Jacob marches to confront his enemy, Esau, and is awed into submission by Esau’s military might (chaps. 32 and 33), a reconciliation is effected. Both the general and specific comparisons between Jacob and Satan, Esau and the Son, are startling. Milton’s Son of  God, like Esau, is the first begotten, the chosen beloved son of  the father, who exercises great military prowess and proves himself  the supreme warrior in his father’s dominions, pleasing his father with his ready obedience. Satan, like Jacob, is the supplanter, the deceiver who, disdaining his younger and inferior status, rebels, using guile and force, against his father’s decreed elevation of  the elder son to inherit the birth- right. Jacob robs Esau of  his father’s birthright blessing and is forced to run away; Satan attempts to rob the Son of his father’s birthright and is forced to flee. The central dramatic action in Paradise Lost, central both in the theological sense of  explaining the existence of  good and evil and also in the sense of  being literally placed in the epic’s middle books (5 and 6), is the rebellion of  Satan and the War in Heaven.

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 193 provides the dramatic motivation for Satan’s rebellion. The epic narrator describes Satan’s refusal to accept the Son as God’s chosen anointed—his elevation from his previous status as Satan’s angelic “brother”45—and the rationale for his subsequent rebellion: he of  the first, If  not the first archangel, great in power, In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught With envy against the Son of  God, that day Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed Messiah anointed, could not bear Through pride that sight, and thought himself  impaired. (PL, 5, 659–65) Milton’s idiosyncratic account of  the genesis of  Satanic evil and dramatization of  the War in Heaven as a fight for birthright combine to provide the theological and dramatic context for Milton’s inverted Jacob/Satan simile. This raises the important question as to why Milton would make these seemingly incongruous associations. An analysis of  seventeenth- century English interpretations of  the biblical characters Jacob and Esau reveals evidence contrary to a simple notion that Jacob is a principal type of  Christ and Esau is an archetypal villain or a “type” of  Satan. In the period, Jacob is not a frequent type of  Christ at all, and English Renaissance references to Jacob as such are fairly scarce.46 Paralleled to the Protestant tradition of attempting exhaustive “literal” exegesis of the Bible—continuing the tradition of Augustine’s three frus- trated attempts at a literal interpretation of Genesis—is the multiplicity of typological readings that interpret almost every character and event, whether ethically laudable or not, as a foreshadowing of  Christ and his mission.47 Such accounts often blur the boundaries between the traditionally attributed moral values and deconstruct (as we would say) the direct correlation of  Jacob as typological hero and Esau as Satanic villain. So William Guild, in his 1620 treatise entitled Moses 45. Compare Richard Strier’s argument in “Milton’s Fetters, or, Why Eden Is Better than Heaven,” Milton Studies 38 (2000): 169–97, that there is a moral equivalence between Milton’s heaven and hell, and between the two leaders therein: “The idea seems to be that the Son, by becoming the ‘Head’ of  angels, is ‘reduced’ to being one of  them” (179). 46. See Galdon, Typology and Seventeenth-Century Literature, 133. 47. This practice escalated until it became contradictory and nonsensical, and by the nineteenth century Protestant theologians were calling for its curtailment. See Patrick Fairbairn, “The Interpretation of  Particular Types—Specific Principles and Directions,” in The Typology of Scripture; or, the Doctrine of Types Investigated (Edinburgh, 1845), vol. 1, chap. 6. </page> <page sequence="22"> 194 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y Unvailed: or those figures which served unto the patterne and shaddow of heavenly things, pointing out the Messiah Christ Jesus, makes an interpre- tation of  Jacob’s trickery that actually associates Isaac with Christ (for reasons of  contrast) and denounces Jacob as sinful: “Isaac being waxed old, and through the dimnesse of  his eyes, not being able to discerne or see, was deceived by Jacob, who got so the blessing of  his elder brother Esau: but our unalterable all-seeing Jesus can never bee deceived, to bestow the blessing upon one for another, or place the same wrong.”48 Guild continues this Christ/Isaac analogy, arguing that “As Isaac loved Esau the elder, so did Christ the Jewes, whom he longed to gather under his wings,” and associates Jacob with the penitent Gentiles who are clothed with the skin of  a kid—Jacob’s disguise to appear as Esau—“which is the remembrance of  their sinnes that killed their saviour” (25). The typological associations are hereby confused and carry multiple and conflicting significations, all coerced toward fulfilling an orthodox Christian antitypical meaning. Although at times Guild does make what later became the orthodox typological association—“Jacob was hated and persecuted by Esau, Gen. 27.41. So was Christ by Satan” (31)—he continually complicates any direct typological alignment of characters and actions, and seems to relish the obfuscation of  type and antitype that results: Jacobs father loved his elder sonne better then him: but not so did the  Father love any equally to his Sonne, even his onely wel-beloved Christ  Jesus. Jacob attained to the birth-right and blessing for himselfe, and  that through Subtiltie: but Christ Jesus hath purchased that heavenly  and blessed inheritance for us onely, and that by paying therefore  dearely. Jacob and Esau were at once both borne of  the wombe of   Rebecca: but Christ Jesus alone onely was borne of  the wombe of  the  inviolable chaste Virgin Mary, without an associate. (37) John Donne in a sermon preached in 1618 discusses the symbolic meaning of  banishment and argues initially that Jacob’s obtaining of the blessing and subsequent forced exile is an action with typological significance: “Herein he was a figure of  Christ; he received a blessing from his father, and presently he must go into banishment; Christ re- ceived presents and adoration from the Magi of the east, and presently he submits himself  to a banishment in Egypt, for the dangers that Herod intended.”49 The typological correlations here are simple and 48.

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 195 direct: Jacob with Christ and Esau with Herod. However, in the very next sentence Donne denies Jacob’s typological role and now associates him with Adam and his exile for the punishment for sin, in effect corre- lating Jacob with the genesis of  evil: “Christs punishment, as it could not be less then four years, so it could not be more then seven; Jacobs was twenty, a banishment, and a long banishment. Banishment is the first punishment executed upon man; he was banished out of Paradise. . . . This was a particular misery, in his banishment, that Jacob must live from his father, and mother, and from that Country, where he was to have the fruits, and effects of  that blessing which he had got.”50 George Herbert in his poem Decay contrasts the somato- morphic appearance of  God to believers in the Old Testament to that of  God’s revelation in the “feeble heart” of  believers in modern days. One allusion Herbert makes is to Yahweh’s “struggle with Jacob” in Genesis 32:24–32, comparing it to the incessant war in the heart of the believer between God and “Sinne and Satan, thy old foes, / [who] Do pinch and straiten thee” (lines 13–14).51 Despite the poem’s primary comparison between external and internal revelations of  God to faithful believers, Herbert compares God’s fight with Jacob to the fight with God’s most ancient enemies, Sin and Satan, all of  whom “use much art / To gain thy thirds and little part” (lines 14–15). In De Doctrina Christiana Milton argues that Jacob’s dissimulation is not morally reprehensible for he is fulfilling God’s prophecy and correcting the disobedience of his father Isaac (CPW, 6, 763). However, in an earlier passage of  the treatise, during his rejection of  Calvinist election, Milton considers the enmity between Jacob and Esau and God’s prophecy that the younger son will receive God’s blessing. Milton argues that this does not per se condemn Esau in God’s eyes, but that both brothers and their descendants can be redeemed. He refuses to consider them as dichotomous and breaks down the correlations of Jacob as Godly and Esau as ungodly, types of  good and bad: “If  the younger is considered worthy of more grace, the elder is not necessarily considered worthy of  none. For this cannot be said of  Esau, who was taught the true worship of  God in his father’s house, nor of  his de- scendants, who were indisputably called to the faith with the rest of the Gentiles” (CPW, 6, 197–98). Accordingly, Milton seems to concur with the other seventeenth-century accounts of  Jacob and Esau that there is no simplistic typological attribution of  Jacob and Esau with good and bad, Christ and the devil. Indeed Milton seems to take it one step further in his epic and, by reversing the orthodox typological 50. Ibid., 1:279. 51. The Works of George Herbert, ed. F. E. Hutchinson (London: Oxford University Press, 1941), 99. </page> <page sequence="24"> 196 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y allegiances, suggests that the embattled elder son Esau is a type for his idiosyncratic ontology of  the Son of  God. Certainly as a biblical scholar Milton was cognizant of  the contradictions between the Genesis and the Hebrews accounts of  Esau and Jacob, an instability that authorizes its replication in Paradise Lost. Joseph Wittreich sug- gests that such instabilities constitute an essential feature of  Miltonic poetry: Rather than fogging over the meaning(s) of  Paradise Lost, the spirit of   contradiction in Milton’s poem, the clashing perspectives in the poem,  and its different arenas of  conflict are the transmitters of  meanings— not easy but subtle and sophisticated, often stinging consciousness  onto a new level of  awareness. Itself  a field of  contending forces and  competing paradigms, Milton’s poem contains—but is not contained  by—frustrating tensions and ambiguities that, a goad to truth, are also  the poem’s most distinctive defining features.52 A second example of this deliberate Miltonic inversion of traditional typological pairings is the surprising alignment of  Milton’s Son and Satan with the biblical Pharaoh and Moses in Milton’s depiction of the flight of the rebellious angels from heaven, drawn from the context of the flight of  the Israelites from Egypt. Sims notes only the orthodox similarity whereby God overthrows Pharaoh and the Egyptians (Satan and devils) through Moses (the Son), although even Sims is forced to admit that “the situations are not exactly parallel.”53 More recently Forsyth notes the indeterminacy of the typological associations but fails to tease out the radical implications: “the immediate effect of  having Satan compared in short order to Pharaoh and then to his opponent Moses is surely to unpick any firm ideas we might have about where to place this Satanic figure and how to evaluate the unfolding narrative.”54 But I have shown that there is a far more convincing analogy during the pursuit of  a broken people from Egypt/heaven between Milton’s Son and Pharaoh, and Satan and the devils with Moses and the Israelites (a common Miltonic resemblance), until the moment when in the bib- lical story it is the pursuers who are destroyed—whereas in Milton’s narrative it is the pursued that “fall,” at which point the traditional allegiances are restored. Milton makes frequent reference to the exodus in his prose writings, but it is the fallen angels standing on the edge of  the lake of  fire at the outset of  Paradise Lost that is reminiscent in Animadversions to 52.

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 197 the Israelites “standing on the shore of  that Red Sea into which our enemies had almost driven us.”55 Milton deliberately establishes orthodox typological relations with the Son’s Mosaic “Stand still in bright array ye saints” (6, 801), then immediately reverses field with the heterodox depiction of  the pursuit of  the Son’s Pharaonic “fierce chariot [that] rolled, as with the sound / Of  torrent floods” (829– 30), only to revert back to orthodoxy as the Mosaic Son watches the “impious foes right onward drove” (831) to their destruction through the parting of  the heavenly Red Sea “which op’ning wide, / Rolled inward” (860–61). One is forced to ask why Milton creates such delib- erate instability of  typological allegiances, and why these throw more doubt on the status of  Milton’s Son than on any other character? One answer is suggested by examining a famous Miltonic analogy in the light of  Milton’s radical and heretical theology of  the Godhead. I have already noted the Satanic travesty in Sin’s sacrificial plea, “O Father, what intends thy hand, she cried, / Against thy only son?” (PL, 2, 727–28), but it also functions as part of  Milton’s creation of  a trinity of  Satan, Sin, and Death at the end of  book 2 of  the poem. This infernal trinity can be simply understood as a perverse parody of the Christian Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the analogy being a false comparison created for dramatic irony. Yet I think this is to oversimplify the matter. The idea of  an infernal trinity is under- standably more problematic in Milton’s epic than it would be in a doctrinally orthodox Christian poem. In Paradise Lost, the Spirit barely appears, which is in keeping with the time Milton spent discussing it in De Doctrina Christiana, and both works go out of their way to illustrate the subordination of  the Son to God.56 Knowing Milton’s vehement disbelief  in the orthodox Trinitarian formulation, it would seem that Milton is more likely to be attacking the whole idea of a Trinity with his portrayal of Satan, Sin, and Death.57 Accordingly, the analogy is neither 55. See Galdon, Typology and Seventeenth-Century Literature, 115. 56. Chapter 5 of  the treatise—the longest chapter by far—is dedicated to refuting a Trinitarian conception of  the Son of  God. The evidence of  Arian or Subordinationist doctrine in Paradise Lost has a long critical history; for recent studies see John P. Rumrich, “Milton’s Arianism: Why It Matters,” in Dobranski and Rumrich, Milton and Heresy, 75–92; and Michael Lieb, “Milton and ‘Arianism,’ ” Religion and Literature 32 (2000): 197–220. 57. Compare Gordon Campbell, “Popular Traditions of  God in the Renaissance,” in Reconsidering the Renaissance, ed. Mario A. Di Cesare (Binghamton: State University of  New York, 1992): “The truth of  the matter is that Milton’s poem does not contain a heavenly trinity, and that his Satanic trinity is not a foil to the Godhead, but rather an attack on a theological doctrine which Milton regards as unsound. The sexual nature of the relationship between Milton’s Satan and his Sin suggests that Milton may be aiming </page> <page sequence="26"> 198 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y dramatically ironic nor a restricted comparison, but a shockingly direct comparison intended to undermine a traditional theological dogma through its deliberately perverse interpretation. This suggests that other artistically unsettling typological analogies might similarly ques- tion the theological veracity of  traditional Christian tenets of  belief. Perhaps the seemingly heretical comparisons between Milton’s Son of  God and biblical and worldly villains function as implied criticism of  a conception of  the traditional second person of  the Trinity, a con- ception that is now fully understood by critics to be rejected in Milton’s personal theological beliefs.58 Similarly, perhaps the analogy between Satan and biblical patriarchs and heroes is further evidence of Milton’s aim to demonstrate the former “brotherhood” of  Satan and the Son, thereby functioning as subtle criticism of  the undue elevation of  the Trinitarian Son.59 This hypothesis is supported by the questionable comparisons between traditional worldly heroes and the Son and Satan. In Paradise Regained, book 2, 196–98, Satan himself  makes an analogy between the Son and Alexander the Great that the devil clearly intends as a compliment to the Son’s abstemious sexual behavior in his rebuke to Belial. Yet the source for Alexander’s self-control with women is a passage in Plutarch that finally admits that Alexander did “fall” with one irresistible woman, Barsine. John Leonard rightly notes that there is hence a problem with this allusion, for either Milton had forgotten about Barsine, and it is therefore a damaging error in the poem, or perhaps the very fact that the words are put into Satan’s mouth means that the allusion is to be rejected—although how this makes sense in the context of  the passage wherein Satan is trying to praise the Son is confusing. What is absent from Leonard’s discussion is the possibility that Milton might have deliberately intended this very subtle criticism of the Son. This is the simplest interpretation of the allusion, for Milton at the font of  the Western tradition, for in his De Trinitate Augustine had articulated the idea (apparently of  his own invention) that the Holy Spirit was the embodiment of the mutual love of  the Father and the Son” (509). Offering yet another perspective, Nuttall in The Alternative Trinity argues for a similarity between the Satan/Sin/Death trinity and the Christian one, behind the obvious contrast (272). 58. The former position, that Milton was not an Arian, was most prominently argued by W. B. Hunter, C. A. Patrides, and J. H. Adamson in Bright Essence: Studies in Milton’s Theology (Salt Lake City: University of  Utah Press, 1971), but has been repudiated to the satisfaction of  most scholars (see articles by Rumrich and Lieb, noted above). 59. See Labriola, “Thy Humiliation shall exalt”; and Neil D. Graves, “Infelix Culpa: Milton’s Son of  God and the Incarnation as a Fall in Paradise Lost,” Philological Quarterly 81 (2002): 159–83. </page> <page sequence="27"> Neil D. Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 199 might have questioned Leonard’s assumption that “Alexander was abstemious by Macedonian standards,” but “those are not the right standards for judging the Son of  God.”60 The problem remains that there are no standards by which the Son can be accurately judged, at least according to orthodox assessment. But it is interesting that Milton should make allusions to the first Classical king who was officially deified and use a passage in which Plutarch is forced to admit to his hero’s failure to attain perfection. Is Milton attempting to suggest that both of  these great deific heroes fall short of  the perfection that only God can attain? Similarly, why does Milton go out of  his way in the famous epic simile comparing Satan’s shield to the moon (PL, 1, 284–91) to further extend the com- parison to Galileo? Can it be explained by either dramatic irony or re- stricted comparison? Critics are not even clear whether the analogy is meant to criticize Galileo as a Marlovian overreacher, noting the moral and spiritual dangers of  the “spotty globe” (291), or whether it is dramatically ironic to compare Galileo and “a culture . . . implicitly superior to . . . the military heroism” of  Satan.61 Whatever else it means, the effect of  the simile is either to implicitly raise Satan (and his behavior) in the reader’s imagination or to demean Galileo (and his research) by the comparison: “And encompassing [the] situation are the perceptual conundrums and choices posed for the reader: is the moon, and Galileo’s scientific exploration of  it, ‘like’ Satan’s shield and therefore a trap to the unwary, or is it the window upon liberation and hope the phrase ‘to descry new lands’ makes it out to be?”62 Con- sidering that Milton met with Galileo in Italy and regards him and his research highly in Areopagitica, it appears that Satan is elevated by this comparison—unless the reader retreats by default into the dubious safety of  the ironic disparity conundrum. As Peter C. Herman argues in Destabilizing Milton, “If  Satan’s evil contaminates the classical epic, as Broadbent noted about Milton’s comparison of  Satan to Jason, the length of  the allusions, their beauty, and their admiring tone suggest that the opposite might also be occurring, that is, that the epic lends Satan some of  its respectability.”63 Further evidence that Milton means to question the status of the Son through his use of  typology comes upon closer inspection of  Milton’s use of  the Abrahamic and Mosaic “plea,” repeated several times in 60.

I have noted that the Son’s intercession to save mankind from God’s judgment in book 3, lines 150–66, is drawn from Old Tes- tament episodes in which patriarchs argue with God and succeed in averting the destruction of  the sinful Israelites, but this typological episode is extremely disturbing in its implications for Milton’s Son. Milton goes out of  his way twice more in Paradise Lost to repeat this exact plea-bargaining argument drawn from the Pentateuch, and both times they are espoused by Adam in extremely morally dubious scenarios that force us to question the meaning of  the analogy to Milton’s Son.64 Initially this comparison between Milton’s intercessory Son and the two biblical patriarchs seems straightforward, until one realizes that the whole Miltonic reconstruction of the debate is redun- dant because the Father has already offered mankind grace (3, 129–34), and this is even acknowledged by the Son (144–45). The comparison obviously cannot function as dramatically ironic, and if  the reader perceives the analogy as severely restricted in nature then this places the patriarchs in the camp of  traditional villains and wholly inappro- priate similitudes, which seems ridiculous. In Renaissance theology, the biblical episodes were normally interpreted as a benevolent Deity demonstrating his willingness to administer unwarranted grace to a begging intercessory,65 just as Milton depicts to great dramatic effect the fictitious scene of  Adam begging God for a mate in Eden (8, 354– 451). Milton explicitly concluded that this “debate” is a pedagogic exer- cise—his God states that “Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased” (437)—which would seem to refute claims by critics such as Merritt Y. Hughes and John Peter that in the analogous God/Son debate “mod- ern criticism is rather inclined to contrast him [Milton’s Son] with the Father as much the cleverer as well as kinder of  the two.”66 However, when one reads the book 3 debate in light of the second Adamic repe- tition of  the Pentateuchal plea in book 9, lines 938–51, at the very moment of  his Fall, the full weight of  moral condemnation comes crashing down on the Son’s head. This is the Son of  De Doctrina Chris- tiana in all his (lack of ) glory: subordinate, created, potentially fallen, a pupil in a classroom discussion. The conclusion we arrive at from what seems as even the most suit- able and appropriate typological analogy is that, in Leonard’s words, 64. See Graves, “Infelix Culpa.” 65. See Randel Helms, “ ‘His Dearest Mediation’: The Dialogue in Heaven in Book III of  Paradise Lost,” Milton Quarterly 5 (1971): 52–57, for exegesis from Andrew Willet, Andraeus Rivetus, Luther, and Calvin, all certainly known to Milton. 66.

Graves „ Typological Aporias in Paradise Lost 201 these are not the right standards for judging the (orthodox Trini- tarian) Son of  God. But Milton, as we know, spent enormous energies in refuting any such conception. Milton subtly criticizes his Son of God by comparisons to human analogues—even biblical heroes—which contrasts with his treatment of  God in the poem who is never com- pared to any other being. As I have shown, Milton critics have refused to draw this conclusion despite noting much of  the evidence for it. Sims argues that the association of Adam with Abraham “prepares the way for Adam’s very human questions and admissions,” noting that Milton’s “Adam is never more dramatically human than when he pleads with his Maker for a mate.”67 The necessary but withheld conclusion of  this point is that the same association must also imply the pseudo- humanity, or less than deific nature, of  the Son. Sims goes on to make an interesting commentary on the nature of  this Miltonic typology: The biblical allusion emphasises both the similarities and the contrasts  between Adam’s and Abraham’s importunity before the Lord. Adam’s  straightforwardness raises him, by contrast, above Abraham. Abraham  repeats respectful introductory phrases as a means of  gradually  reducing the required number of  righteous persons for the city  [Sodom] to be spared instead of  making known frankly his real wish:  that Lot and his family be spared. Adam, on the other hand, is fully as  respectful and reverent as Abraham in addressing himself  to God, but,  more straightforwardly, he makes one clear request: a human consort  to partake of  the pleasures of  Paradise with him.68 If  the Abrahamic trope “humanizes” Milton’s Adam, one would have to see it also doing so to the Son, while the latter additionally argues with a degree of  circumlocution reminiscent of  Abraham’s distasteful plea bargaining rather than Adam’s straightforward dealings with God. The analogy works to the detriment of  the Son, and Milton’s multiple applications of  this typological episode seem meant to define the Son as a subordinate and created “begotten” leader rather than as the second member of  the orthodox Trinity. And this reveals a paradox in the history of  Milton criticism: the desire for Milton’s poetry to communicate the orthodox truths of  Christianity encouraged the hermeneutical distortion of  Milton’s text; by contrast, an increas- ing willingness to unfetter hermeneutical constraints has manifested a superior understanding of  Milton’s heterodoxy. 67.
