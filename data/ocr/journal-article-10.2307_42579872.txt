<plain_text><page sequence="1">RETROSPECT • FIFTY YEARS AGO IN ETC • We are engulfed by a sea of sound. Only the deaf are privi- leged to know the peace of utter stillness. Sound is so much with us that we perform the wonder of listening almost as unconsciously as the beasties afield. We listen for the most part as artlessly as we breathe. But, while under practically all circumstances Nature and the medulla oblongata will attend to our breathing for us, we can entrust our listening to our reflexes only at the risk of losing our birthrights. As speakers, men have become schooled in the arts of per- suasion, and without the counter-art of listening a man can be persuaded - even by his own words - to eat foods that ruin his liver, to abstain from killing flies, to vote away his right to vote, and to murder his fellows in the name of righ- teousness. The art of listening holds for us the desperate hope of withstanding the spreading ravages of commercial, nationalistic and ideological persuasion. Unless the gentle watchword, "Listen!" becomes an arresting command, we 109</page><page sequence="2">110 Et cetera • Spring 1999 may not halt in time the stampede of humanity in its pursuit of the enchanting tootling of the Pied Piper of Doom. Wendell Johnson, "Do You Know How to Listen?" The word-manipulating professions have of necessity grown in importance with increasing economic interdepen- dency in a technological world. The more industrialized soci- ety becomes, the more carefully must human effort be coordinated - and this coordination is achieved by lan- guage. The more interdependent society becomes, the more communications there must be. The need for everyone to be understood (or at least to be heard) by other persons, by other classes of society, by people of other faiths, occupations, other economic interests, other nationalities, is a direct out- come of this vast social interdependency which industrializa- tion has created. The result of this vast need for communication created by the modern world is familiar to us all. The citizen of today, Christian or Jew or Mohammedan, financier or farmhand, stockbroker or stockboy, has to interpret more words a day than the citizen of any earlier time in world history. Literate or semiliterate, we are assailed by words all day long: news commentators, soap operas, campaign speeches, newspapers, the propaganda of pressure groups or governments - all of these tiying to tell us something, to manipulate our beliefs, whether about the kind of toothpaste to use or the kind of economic system to support. We are told these many things sometimes for our own good, and sometimes for the good of those who tell and not for ours. We are living in a time when millions of dollars are spent each day by people who want to make up our minds for us. It is natural that this kind of climate should generate wide- spread scepticism. Confronted by the clamor of a thousand</page><page sequence="3">Retrospect 111 contradictory voices, our tendency is to say "Lefs not believe anybody!" We therefore have many sceptics in the modern world - people who simply refuse to believe anything. In my own experience I have found that such sceptics belong to two large groups: first, there is the working class group of sceptics, who tend to disbelieve all newspapers, all the propaganda of the employing classes, and most of the propa- ganda of their union leaders. They are left believing, by and large, only what they learn from face-to-face contact with people whom they have learned to know and trust. The second class of sceptics is found among those who are themselves in the word-manipulating professions. They have seen, or been party to, so many phony publicity stunts, slanted news stories, deceptive political campaigns, or ill- advised public relations drives, that they take a kind of pro- fessional pride in not believing anything. I should also in- clude in this class of sceptics some academic people of my acquaintance who are so clever that they see through every- thing: the logical weaknesses of the arguments for capitalism or against it; the weaknesses of the arguments both of theists and atheists; the shortcomings of science and the shortcom- ings of the alternatives to science. These sceptics of the word- manipulating class are perhaps in an even sadder state than the working-class sceptics, because the latter at least continue to believe in each other as partners in work, and they believe in the realities of their work. When a man digs potatoes, he does not doubt the reality and validity of potatoes. But the sceptic of the word-manipulating class is sceptical above all things of the validity and worth of his own work, because if all communications are suspect, so are his own. This convic- tion leads to the kind of disintegration into cynicism (and sometimes drink) not uncommon in the journalistic profes- sion, in advertising, in politics, and (we are forced to admit) in academic life. S. I. Hayakawa, "The Task of the Listener"</page><page sequence="4">112 Et cetera • Spring 1999 With plogglies, then, everything can be explained very satisfacto- rily - to anyone who believes in plogglies. There are many plog- glies scurrying around us today, although some of the modern plogglies are much more subtle than brownies, for example. One might say that they are more abstract. - Wendell Johnson. Semantic obscurantism, the mistaking of words for things, and belief in the magic of words are as widespread in politics as in any other field of human endeavor. Sir James Frazeťs theory that the king evolved from the magician might easily be extended to explain the operations of the modern art of statecraft, were it not for the implications in The Golden Bough that the most successful chiefs were those who clearly recog- nized the inefficacy of their magic and used it only to hood- wink their followers. Although it is obvious that the employment of scare headlines and other propaganda tech- niques to delude the citizeniy is still a major preoccupation of statesmen, an inquiry into the premises and theories on which much of the strategy and tactics of modern politics are based will show that word-magic, anthropomorphism, and other primitive notions are still working beliefs. Fenton Jameson, "Plogglies and Politics" In the introductory section of his book, Lasswell draws the distinction between symbols that are "credenda," or repre- sent things to be believed, and those that are "miranda," which represent things to be admired. In application to the current legal jargon, this distinction might be used to differ- entiate between terms that are capable of meaning, or of be- ing believed, in that they have some operational referent, and terms that are incapable of real meaning, and have only an emotional or a ritualistic function. Specifically, it is sug- gested that however ambiguous or uncertain the semantic</page><page sequence="5">Retrospect 113 significance may be, there is potentially an operational refer- ent for terms such as "property," "contract," "crimes," "torts," "corporation," "marriage," etc. On the other hand, terms such as "right," "duty," "justice," "equity," "reasonable," "legal," and similar words, have no discernible function other than to invoke favorable emotional reactions for any proposition in which they appear. If further semantic analysis should sup- port this conclusion, then a content analysis which would reveal the relative proportion of operational and ritualistic terms in various judicial decisions would be of the greatest importance in evaluating those decisions. It is truly astonishing that no serious attempt has yet been made to sort out, much less to measure, the operational as against the ritualistic terms used in law. Most writers have simply assumed that all legal terms were meaningful, and oceans of ink have been spilt in arguing the nuance of "defi- nition" of such terms as "right," "duty," "law," and "justice." The few writers, like Thurman Arnold, who have brought some semantic consciousness to their study, have contented themselves with labeling all legal symbols as purely ceremo- nial. It is certainly high time for us to begin to discriminate between the meaningful and meaningless terms that com- prise the legal lexicon. This will undoubtedly require not only legal learning but arduous work and rigorous semantic discipline. Nevertheless without it we will continue to jabber about law in a confused jargon, the principal function of which is to distinguish the initiated from the laity and to im- press the latter with the authority of the former.
