<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Pretext for Wallace Stevens' "Sunday Morning" Sidney Feshbach City College: CUNY &amp; University of Massachusetts: Amherst 1 The poems extant from 1898 to about 1914 show that Wallace Stevens had written or saved only short poems.2 In the spring of 1914, he evidently decided that it was time to attempt something longer, and over the next six months he wrote "Sunday Morning" {Collected Poems , pp. 66-70)3 and "Peter Quince at the Clavier" (pp. 89-92); in 1915-16, he composed "For an Old Woman in a Wig," extant in a fragment.4 The title of "Peter Quince at the Clavier" indicates an important relationship to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night 's Dream , with its "rude mechanical," Peter Quince, while its reference, "like the strain/ Waked in the elders by Susanna," (p. 90) is to the Book of Daniel's addition of the Apocryphal "Susanna and the Elders." The rhyme scheme of "For an Old Woman in a Wig" imitates the terza rima of Dante's Commedia ; and its three sections borrow Dante's structure of three domains of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Stevens appears to have turned to Midsummer Night's Dream , the Book of Daniel , and the Commedia for help with his problems in moving from the short lyric to the longer poem. It is highly likely that for "Sunday Morning" he turned for help to another work, George Santayana's Interpretations of Poetry and Religion .5 He followed 1 1 want to thank Lee Edwards, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who read the initial essay and encouraged me to continue, Robert Buttel, Temple University, who read the next version and whose skepticism forced me to work harder, and Blair T.

(The last chapter applies to the last stanza, but as its topic is so general, "The Elements of Poetry," it may apply as well to the entire poem. He also drew some material from across the thresholds of adjacent chapters and some from quite distant passages.)6 This is especially apparent in Stanzas VII and III. * * * * Generally accepted by Stevens' scholars and critics is the fact that Stevens made deliberate- and often easily traced- use of his readings in literature and philosophy, especially, aesthetics, in books and journals, as of his meditating on, and playing with, such items as flowers, gardens, weather, paintings, classical music, musical theatre, popular song, and radio broadcasts.7 These resources were an important part of his frequently-used technique for stimulating poetic invention. He once pictured himself, in "The Irrational Element in Poetry," as staying alert to, even deliberately seeking ordinary stimuli, or pressures, for poems: "A day or two before Thanksgiving we had a light fall of snow in Hartford. It melted a little by day and then froze again at night, forming a thin, bright crust over the grass. At the same time, the moon was almost full. I awoke once several hours before daylight and as I lay in bed I heard the steps of a cat running over the snow under my window almost inaudibly. The faintness and strangeness of the sound made on me one of those impressions which one so often seizes as pretexts for poetry."8 For him, texts did work as pretexts. Accepted by his scholars and critics is that Stevens knew Santayana personally, read his work, and deliberately derived from him aspects of his own aesthetics. Joel Porte writes that "Santayana's truest disciple, his most constant ephebe . . ., was Wallace Stevens . . . "( Interpretations , p. xxix). Discussions of Santayana's influence on Stevens narrow repeatedly to Interpretations of Poetry and Religion . Frank Kermode writes that Stevens "presumably absorbed" the writings of Santayana "in his youth," and " Interpretations of Poetry and Religion (1900) is a key book for [his] thought. . . ]."9 Before the publication of Santayana's book, Stevens could have seen or heard portions of it. George Lensing indicates that "In Stevens' last year at Harvard, Santayana's Interpretations of Poetry and Religion was published. Stevens must have known it well, and Santayana may have shared some of its 6 It is not feasible to present here the argument supporting this close correspondence between all the stanzas of the poem and and all the chapters of the book. Furthermore, to argue the thesis using only one stanza cannot be persuasive, for almost any conclusion can be drawn from only one stanza, as can be seen in other criticism of this poem, which analyzes, for example, only Stanza VII in order ostensibly to prove (incorrectly, I would add) Stevens' all-pervasive hedonism. The compromise used here is to analyze two stanzas, Stanza VII and Stanza m, and then to indicate in a summary some of the details of the other correspondences. 7 See for Stevens' readings in general George S.

"I dined with Santayana [and Pierre La Rose] last night. ... La Rose read a criticism in the Nation on his 'Interpretation of Religion &amp; Poetry.' The criticism was decidedly unpleasant- and shallow. Santayana took it good-naturedly. Discussed the Emerson essay. Laughed at Emerson's habit of eating pie for breakfast, etc."12 As though to complete this circle of intimate involvement, Samuel French Morse suggests that Stevens, as editor of the Harvard Advocate™ may have reviewed Santayana's book anonymously in his journal,14 Whether the unsigned review in the Harvard Advocate was written by him or by someone else,15 as editor surely Stevens knew it well. The review considers carefully Santayana's philosophy, and its last sentence corresponds directly with the situation of the woman in "Sunday Morning": Complacencies of the peignoir, and late Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, And the green freedom of a cockatoo Upon a rug mingle to dissipate The holy hush of ancient sacrifice, (pp. 66-67) 10 Lensing, p. 27. This essay arguing Stevens' profound familiarity with Santayana's Interpretations would appear to confirm Kermode's and Lensing's suggestions. 11 Lensing, p. 28. 12 Holly Stevens, Souvenirs and Prophecies: The Young Wallace Stevens (Knopf, 1977), p. 68. The review mentioned by Stevens appeared in The Nation , LXX (24 May 1900), pp. 405-06. Its mild satire contrasts with the intelligent, sympathetic, and most respectful review in the Harvard Advocate, which demonstrates broader awareness of Santayana's political and cultural conservatism. Stevens reversed the title's Poetry and Religion . His "shallow" suggests that La Rose read the review aloud and someone made a joke after its reference to "Mr. Justice Shallow" {The Nation , p. 406). 13 Harvard Advocate, LXIX (24 March 1900), pp. 31-32.

"Sunday Morning" begins with a composition of place, resembling poems and paintings of the type of "Et in Arcadia ego " ("And in Arcadia I, death, am"). The poem describes a woman, on some Sunday morning (possibly Easter, even Easter Sunday, 11 April 1915), sitting "in a sunny chair," relaxed, complacent, islanded, detached from any signs of weekday routines, daydreaming. The fact that the woman is daydreaming when reclining in leisure and freedom in the midst of nature domesticated in food and rug emphasizes that the "genius of the place" is internalized in the mind, engaged, in its own domestic Arcadia; stimulated by the religious celebration on Sunday mornings, she must encounter, through remembering, death, in her Arcadia, a memento mori. Santayana writes that "the ideality of the machine we call Nature, the conventionality of the drama we call the world, are too glaring not to be somehow perceived by all. Each must sometimes fall back upon the soul; he must challenge this apparition [the soul] with the thought of death; [and by thinking about death,] he must ask himself for the mainspring and value of his life" ( Interpretations , p. 160). Of course, the poem's immediate central philosophical and thematic test- and the measure of the woman's and the poet's strength of purpose-rests in its speculations about the best response to the idea and actuality of mutability and of death. The woman feels the arrival of the ideas of sacrifice and resurrection to her consciousness in the sounds of church, which is like a morbid invasion of a Near Eastern religion, Christianity. The poet writes, "she feels the dark / Encroachment of that old catastrophe" (p. 67). In Interpretations of Poetry and Religion , Santayana describes a nymph, also islanded, also confronted with the arrival of a foreign god, Apollo; she does not want him to set up a temple to himself in her area. Santayana writes, "The nymph of the spot, fearing the encroachments of so much more powerful a deity, deceived him and persuaded him to plant his temple on another site . . . "(p. 23). Stevens uses this topos of the encroachment in the bower of contentment in the companion poems of 1915: in "Sunday Morning," with the complacent woman "invaded" by Christianity and the sound of sacrifice, and in "Peter Quince at the Clavier" (p. 89), with the relaxed Susanna "invaded" by the Elders and the music of lust and sacrifice. The similarities of circumstance and phrasing are striking. Both Santayana and Stevens describe female figures in similar kinds of situations: the nymph resists the "encroachment" of a divinity with a religion foreign to her; the woman is ambivalent about the invasion of the sounds of Christianity because however disturbing is "that old catastrophe" of sacrifice, it also conveys or stirs in her daydreaming features that she desires, especially, ideas of renewal, permanence, and certainty. The woman vulnerable to mystic hopes is in need of Santayana's philosophy, as the reviewer in the Harvard Advocate notes, "as a breath of clear cold air." The poet, as a type of truth-teller, brings her that "breath of clear cold air," and his words throughout the remaining seven stanzas are meant as an "eminently sane and rational view of life and its meaning." Strengthened by Santayana's philosophical views, 16 Harvard Advocate , p. 32.</page><page sequence="5">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 63 Stevens is not shaken by the idea of death. Two of the main themes of Interpretations of Poetry and Religion- an evolving of the ideas of the divine and an evolving of eschatological inventions in response to confrontations with death- are clearly main themes of "Sunday Morning," and Santayana's example of "The nymph of the spot, fearing the encroachments of so much more powerful a deity" congruent with the reviewer's "one, drowsy with the warm scent of mystic Ones and transcendent Experiences" were plausibly primary pretexts for this poem. * * * * According to Santayana, his Interpretations was "composed of a number of papers written at various times" (p. 3), with "rather miscellaneous subjects" (p. 5). Its miscellanous character is relevant because the poem adheres exactly to its historical miscellany. Organized into three main areas, Interpretations begins with very broad epistemological, or phenomenological, generalities about the psychological fundamentals of understanding, imagination, and mysticism that, because they apply to human nature in general, are logically prior to his correlation of poetry and religion. Upon this base of human psychology, nine "miscellaneous" essays provide examples from cultural history of the changing relationships of poetry and religion, the last essay with generalizations about the functions of poetic material itself. The middle essays, Chapters 2 through 9, cover an idiosyncratic historical sequence from pre- Homeric hymns through Hebrew and Christian texts, Italian poems from Dante to Lorenzo de' Medici, plays of Shakespeare, poems of Whitman and Browning, prose of Emerson, to poems and prose by Jean Lahor, written in the last decade of the nineteenth century, with important reference to Vedantic Hinduism.17 That is, in eight not very long or dense chapters, but in its author's famous elegant manner, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion sweeps through close to three thousand years of cultural history, grouped in large cultural epochs, traveling from the Mediterranean to the United States and then to Paris, presenting a set of ideas regarding the relations of poetry and religion. Not a political or mercantile history, but a history of ideas and culture, in an approach that stands between, say, Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit and A.O. Lovejoy's The Great Chain of Being (Hegel influencing Santayana and Santayana both Stevens and Lovejoy), the eight chapters discuss differing attitudes, from the mythologized simple pagan wonderment of the ancient Greeks at the concreteness of life to a French poet's ultra-sophisticated interests in Hindu ideas of illusion and nothingness and Mallarméan symbolisme. Each chapter lends its philosophical concerns and history to the corresponding stanza. Altogether, it is a philosopher's survey of several ideas grounded in psychology and expressed in poetry and religion, across almost three thousand years of cultural history. 17 Santayana will repeat in future essays his philosophical preference for Greek and Hindi views. In 1953, he wrote about himself, "I soon learned to admire also Hellenistic and Indian wisdom," and, later, "... my philosophy reverts to a very ancient conviction of the wise, one common to Indian mystics and Greek naturalists," Birth of Reason and Other Essays, ed. Daniel Cory, new introduction, Herman J. Saatkamp, Jr. (1968; Columbia University Press, n.d.), pp. 134 and 142, respectively. That Emerson was also interested in Hindu philosophy makes an interesting comparison with Santayana's ideas and another clue to their influence on Stevens. The references to Greek and Hindi in Santayana join Stevens' Stanzas II and Vm.</page><page sequence="6">64 Journal of Modem Literature * * * * The vocabulary, syntax, and thought of Stanza VII appear fairly accessible; and so, too, are their refraction of the cultural epoch of the nineteenth century as represented in Santayana. In its clarity of statement, Stanza VII resembles the "pre-Homeric" directness of Stanza II and is most different from the convolutions of the "dissolution of paganism" of Stanza III. Yet, Stanza VII is difficult for reasons that are not directly related to II or III: the problems with Stanza VII are in determining its philosophical affiliation and its generic, or modal, qualities, that is, in evaluating its moral possibilities and in locating the attitude or tone of the language. The most frequent evaluation of this stanza's thought and style is that it presents and endorses hedonism; and, then, its hedonism is described or condemned and re-fried in an effort to define Stevens' so-called aestheticism. Perhaps the first literary criticism asserting its hedonism- certainly the best known and most influential- is by Yvor Winters.18 It is fairly easy to shake off this critique without reference to mode, because, simply, Winters mistakenly equates hedonism with Epicureanism. And Stevens' knowledge and apparent belief in Epicureanism, which he read directly in Epicurus' Fragments , or in Lucretius' De rerum naturae (On the Nature of Things ), or as mediated by Santayana (in many places, but especially in Three Philosophical Poets 19), was not hedonism, not pleasure pursued for itself, but pleasure moderated severely by self-control and satisfactions sought for the reduction of pain and anxiety in order (and it is this that Winters ignored entirely) to create conditions necessary for calmness and contemplation and poetic activity.20 No, not hedonism, but Epicureanism. When Harriet Monroe, the editor of Poetry , received the typescript of "Sunday Morning," she wrote to Stevens that she accepted it and asked for some changes. In a letter of 6 June 1915, he offered a different order, some word substitutions, and some omissions; he left out VII. Possibly he wrote another letter saying that he wanted to include this stanza, or, more probably, Monroe followed with another letter in which she wondered about including it. He responded on 23 June 1915: "No. 7 of Sunday Morning is, as you suggest, of a different tone, but it does not seem to me to be too detached to conclude with" (L 183).21 The result was the appearance of five of the eight sections in Poetry , VII (November 1 9 1 5), 8 1 -83(1 1 83n7), with Stanza VII receiving extraordinary emphasis from its location as last of the group. (If 18 Milton J. Bates, Wallace Stevens: A Mythology of Self (University of California Press, 1985), pp. 93, 113. Winters: "hedonistic ethics, as in the philosophy of Epicurus, may take on a somewhat passive or negativistic character; that is pleasure may come to be more or less nearly identified simply with the avoidance of pain" (p. 5) in Yvor Winters, In Defense of Reason: Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry, Maule 's Curse: Seven Studies in the History of American Obscrantism; The Anatomy of Nonsense ; The Significance of the Bridge by Hart Crane , or What Are We to Think of Professor X? (Swallow Press and William Morrow and Co., 1947), which includes the essay, "Wallace Stevens, or the Hedonist's Progress," pp. 431-59. Other literary criticism of Stevens which uses the term "Epicurean" does not differentiate it from hedonism and generally means by it merely "pleasure-seeking. " 19 George Santayana, Three Philosophical Poets: Lucretius, Dante, and Goethe , Harvard Studies in Comparative Literature, Vol. I (1910; Harvard University Press, 1922). 20 Stevens' characteristic Epicureanism is relevant to the whole poem as well as to the whole of Collected Poems, not alone to this stanza, and, therefore, it cannot be discussed properly here. 21 Wallace Stevens, Letters , ed. Holly Stevens (Alfred A. Knopf, 1966).</page><page sequence="7">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 65 Winters first read the poem in Poetry and made an unshakeable judgment on that basis, this placement could have misled him into emphasizing hedonism.) With the whole poem before her, Monroe was correct in noting its "different tone." Stevens' critics, also with the whole poem and certainly with Harmonium in hand, should pause before affirming, condemning, or merely describing the animal excitement of Stanza VII as primary evidence of Stevens' attitudes. Many interpretations emphasize this stanza's seeming commitment to orgiastic sun-worship. A brief and interesting commentary by Peter Thorslev, even though it is an extremer version, may stand for many more. The "Wild Man" of this stanza has come to symbolize a nature that is fecund, spontaneous, sublime . . . "mother mysterious," a dark and amoral force upon earth . . a "blood-consciousness." ... It is this savage on which Wallace Stevens' female persona meditates on a "Sunday Morning," when she has rejected all Christian mysteries and otherwordly Edens with their "insipid lutes. ..." This Dionysian savage is the most enduring of all, because he is quite immune to fact and to scientific voyages of discovery: he is on the one hand pure myth, on the other a universal psychological reality.22 It is hard to see how the critics could imagine that in his buttoned-up business-suit life, Stevens would be advertising directly for the Lawrentian savagery of only the first five lines of Stanza VII- especially without considering the anti-Lawrentian bloodless remainder of the stanza. Stevens was not comfortable in either downtown bohemia or uptown salon, no less as an advocate of an orgiastic poetry or life-style. Another perspective suggests placing this stanza in the relevant historical context of the First World War and a "vision of masculine camraderie." But when James Longenbach holds this stanza and that war in the same frame, he is compelled to self-correction: "Reading stanza VII in the context of the whole of 'Sunday Morning,' however, it becomes more difficult to tell exactly where Steven' sympathies lie."23 However tempting it may be to interpret these lines as alluding to the life and death of the young in the First World War, placing this stanza next to poems which Stevens wrote for the War issue of Poetry makes this view immediately suspect. The war poems show a much more serious attitude to the theme and greater respect for current history than is found in Stanza VII. To eliminate the deaths of the young in the war by dissolving them into nature in this way is sentimentality; when placed next to the war poems, vacuous; and, in 1915, in the midst of the war itself, a grotesque carpe diem. Indeed, if read straight, the stanza's sun-worship followed by early death is mindless excitement followed by groundless consolation. The more serious difficulty in analyzing the stanza is in determining its mode. I propose that it is satiric. Suppose that from among the first responses to Swift's "A Modest Proposal" those asserting that Swift was immoral to recommend cannibalism as a solution to famine and overpopulation in Ireland had been accepted: we would still need to offer evidence to persuade 22 Peter L Thorslev, Jr., "The Wild Man's Revenge," in The Wild Man Within: An Image in Western Thought from the Renaissance to Romanticism, ed. E. Dudley and M.E. Novak (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1972), pp. 285-86. 23 James Longenbach, Wallace Stevens: The Plain Sense of Things (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 74.</page><page sequence="8">66 Journal of Modem Literature that its proposals were intended to be satiric. But establishing the stanza's satiric intent alters the meanings of its morality. For example, if Winters is correct in saying that the stanza advocates hedonism, then satire implies a partial or total rejection in an indirect critique. If Thorslev is correct, that it endorses orgiastic excitement and sentimental absorption into nature, then satire collapses that interpretative inflation into the puny. Stanza VII is recognized clearly as a satire when its composition is read in relation to Chapter 7 and 8 of Santayana, with his judgments of nineteenth-century poetry, especially that of Whitman, Browning, and Emerson. About "this phase of genius" (p. 109), writes Santayana, "This poetry should be viewed in relation to the general moral crisis and imaginative disintegration [of the nineteenth century] of which it gives a verbal echo; then we shall avoid the injustice of passing it over as insignificant, no less than the imbecility of hailing it as essentially glorious and successful" (p. 104). Stevens balanced these views of the poems as documents of nineteenth-century morality with the excess of ignoring or glorifying them by using the mode of satire. Suggestions for using the sun to represent naked material power, while retaining its association with Apollo, come first from the previous chapter, the sixth, of Interpretations of Poetry and Religion , in which Santayana writes that "Shakespeare himself, had it not been for the time and place in which he lived, when religion and imagination blocked rather than helped each other, would perhaps have allowed more of a cosmic background to appear behind his crowded scenes. . . . The material forces of Nature, or their vague embodiment in some northern pantheon, would then have stood behind his heroes" (p. 101). Then, in Chapter 7, Santayana intuits a "northern pantheon" behind Browning's Christianity: "at heart it has far more affinity to the worship of Thor or of Odin than to the religion of the Cross" (p. 125). This view prepares the way for Stanza VII' s implicit comparison of the sun with the sun-god of the Classical pantheon, Apollo, who, Santayana writes in Reason in Religion , "travels yearly from the hyperborean regions toward the south."24 Possibly Stevens was constrained by his thematic decision to differentiate the sun from myths about the sun, as in the Apollonian myth (he may have remembered as well that the island of the pre-Homeric nymph was encroached upon by Apollo). Hence, the first lines of the stanza are influenced by (Phoebus) Apollo, "the sun god," and the last by Phoebus (Apollo), "the killer from afar" (or a Dionysian Apollo followed by an Apollonian Dionysus). This nexus of the south-voyaging northern sun is behind the famous and oft-abused lines: Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun. . . . (pp. 69-70) Following Santayana, Stevens invokes an Apollonian sun as the force of nature25 stripped of its mythic garment, rendering it as a positivistic material force to be celebrated "naked" as Whitman might have: 24 George Santayana, Reason in Religion , Vol m of the five volume The Life of Reason, or The Phases of Human Progress (1905-6; Charles Scribner's Sons, 1951), p. 67. 25 In Reason in Religion , Apollo is found "forgetting to be the material sun" (pp. 66-67).</page><page sequence="9">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 67 Not a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them. ... (p. 70) While the stanza's opening vigor and chant of the men derive mainly from Santayana's comments about Whitman, its use of summer, sun, and an implied hyperborean Apollo derive from the chapter's discussion of Browning. Contrary to Whitman, Browning dressed his characters- in masks or in a skin (much the same to Santayana): "For the most part his hero, like Whitman's, is himself; not appearing, as in the case of the American bard, in puris naturalibus , but masked in all sorts of historical and romantic finery. Sometimes, however, the personage ... is merely a Marsyas, shown flayed and quivering to the greater glory of the poet's ideal Apollo" (pp. 117-18). The stanza's orgiastic turbulence is subdued for Santayana in the following lines, in which it produces a new notion of paradise, or as paradise might be. The poet uses the blood-terms found here and there in the poem and especially in Stanza III: Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, Out of their blood, returning to the sky. ... (p. 70) Of their chant, "Fortunately, the political theory that makes Whitman's principle of literary prophecy and criticism does not always inspire his chants ..." {Interpretations , p. 1 14). Their voices, addressed entirely to the materialist's nature, minus Whitman's "political theory," misfire or inflate their natural nature of lake, trees, and hills into a landscape felt in a superficially Biblical lexicon and style: And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, The windy lake wherein their lord delights, The trees, like serafín, and echoing hills, That choir among themselves long afterward, (p. 70) Santayana's judgment of Whitman is severe. He is not swept away by the bard's rhetorical power. He differentiates his "primitivism" from the pre-Homeric, using distinctions that may also be used to differentiate Stanza II's simpler direct language from Stanza VII's more raucous actions: the pre-Homeric poet "bathed all things human in the golden light of morning; it clothed sorrow in a kind of majesty, instinct with both self-control and heroic frankness . . ., a rendering of human nature, so spontaneous a delight in life, so uncompromising a dedication to beauty, and such a gift of seeing beauty in everything" ( Interpretations , p. 103); and of the nineteenth-century poets, "The comparatively barbarous ages had a poetry of the ideal; they had visions of beauty, order, and perfection. This age of material elaboration has no sense for those things. Its fancy is retrospective, whimsical, and flickering; its ideals, when it has any, are negative and partial; its moral strength is a blind and miscellaneous vehemence. Its poetry, in a word, is the poetry of barbarism" ( Interpretations , p. 104). The pre-Homeric does not fit Stanza VII because the barbaric bard with his "barbaric yawp" is overcome with "a new faith in man's absolute power, a kind of return to the inexperience and self-assurance of youth" ( Interpretations , p. 105).</page><page sequence="10">68 Journal of Modem Literature "The poetry of barbarism is not without its charm. [Whitman's poetry] can play with sense and passion the more readily and freely in that it does not aspire to subordinate them to a clear thought or a tenable attitude of the will. It can impart the transitive emotions which it expresses; it can find many partial harmonies of mood and fancy; it can, by virtue of its red- hot irrationality, utter wilder cries, surrender itself and us to more absolute passion, and heap up a more indiscriminate wealth of images than belong to poets of seasoned experience or of heavenly inspiration" (p. 107). Nevertheless, it remains barbarism: We find the swarms of men and objects rendered as they might strike the retina in a sort of waking dream. It is the most sincere possible confession of the lowest- I mean the most primitive- type of perception. All ancient poets are sophisticated in comparison and give proof of longer intellectual and moral training. Walt Whitman has gone back to the innocent style of Adam. ... (p. 109) The style of Stevens' first eight lines may be thought of as cooked by Whitman's heat; however, it is cooled from paganism into one heavily flavored with a rhetorical Biblical grandiosity: And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, The windy lake wherein their lord delights, The trees, like serafín, and echoing hills, That choir among themselves long afterward, (p. 70) The tone, using a Biblical cadence, syntax, and lexicon here and in the remainder of the stanza, echoes ministerial Biblical oratory. This change in style expresses a shift from Apollo to Jehovah, from ancient Greek to Adam, from Whitman to Emerson, of whom Santayana wrote that being "a clergyman, he was at first in the habit of referring to the Bible and its lessons as to a supreme authority" ( interpretations , p. 139). "The spirit of conformity, the unction, the loyalty even unto death inspired by the religion of Jehovah, were dispositions acquired by too long a discipline and rooted in too many forms of speech, of thought, and of worship for a man like Emerson, who had felt their full force, ever to be able to lose them. The evolutions of his abstract opinions left that habit unchanged. Unless we keep this circumstance in mind, we shall not be able to understand the kind of elation and sacred joy, so characteristic of his eloquence, with which he propounds laws of Nature and aspects of experience which, viewed in themselves, afford but an equivocal support to moral enthusiasm" ( Interpretations , p. 137). Biblical oratory in this moment diverts attention from its terrible message about early death. For the deaths of young men, Stevens uses Santayana's description of Emerson's withdrawal from the "the ancient fellowship of the church" ( Interpretations , p. 139) in his Transcendentalist's "heavenly fellowship": They shall know well the heavenly fellowship</page><page sequence="11">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 69 Of men that perish and of summer morn. And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feet shall manifest, (p. 70) Change and death are treated too easily: consolation for young lives lost in early deaths cannot be found in "whither they shall go" or "dew" that evaporates in the noon sun and returns brand new the following dawn for orgy. Stanza VII is comparable to an item in the New York Times Magazine section for Easter Sunday, 1 1 April 1915, which day is close to the date (still unknown) when Stevens wrote "Sunday Morning." The Times remembers the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Lincoln and reprints the "Funeral Oration in Union Square" by George Bancroft, whose words sound so much like Emerson's attitudes and the juxtaposition of the death of the young men and peacefulness, as well as Stanza VIF s soft focus for the occasion: Through all the mad business of treason he [Lincoln] retained the sweetness of a most placable disposition, and the slaughter of myriads of the best on the battlefields and the more terrible destruction of our men in captivity by the slow torture of exposure and starvation had never been able to provoke him into harboring one vengeful feeling or one purpose of cruelty.26 The juxtaposition of this Emersonian Lincoln and the grim First World War is noted in an editorial, "War news give a place to the absorbing subject of the assassination." People slaughtered in war evaporating like dew into the cosmos resembles Santayana's view of Emerson's "question of evil and of its evaporation in the universal harmony of things" (p. 136). On the question of evil, Emerson's position is of the same kind. There is evil, of course, he tells us. Experience is sad. There is a crack in everything that God has made. But, ah! the laws of the universe are sacred and beneficent. Without them nothing good could arise. All things, then, are in their right places and the universe is perfect above our querulous tears. Perfect? we may ask. But perfect from what point of view, in reference to what idea? To that of man who renouncing himself and all naturally dear to him, ignoring the injustice, suffering and impotence in the world, allows his will and his conscience to be hypnotized by the spectacle of a necessary evolution, and lulled into cruelty by the pomp and music of a tragic show? (Interpretations, p. 137) Emerson "was like a young god making experiments in creation: he blotched the work and always began again on a new and better plan. Every day he said, 'Let there by light,' and 26 George Bancroft, "Funeral Oration in Union Square: Eloquent Eulogy of Lincoln by the Hon. George Bancroft, Pronounced During Lincoln Obsequies Fifty Years Ago," Mew York Times, 1 1 April 1915 (Magazine Section), p. 5.</page><page sequence="12">70 Journal of Modem Literature every day the light was new. His sun, like that of Heraclitus, was different every morning" {Interpretations, p. 132).27 Following Santayana, Stevens is toying with Emerson's presumed optimism by describing deaths with exaggerated sweetness. Like Browning's poetry, the stanza's ending "cloaks irrationality in sanctimony ..." ( Interpretations , p. 126). Stevens appears to be following the "great dramatists" and the "great poets" who have "cast [the] mixed materials furnished by life into forms congenial to the specific principles of their art, and by this transformation they have made acceptable in the aesthetic sphere things that in the sphere of reality were evil or imperfect: in a word, their works have been beautiful as works of art" ( Interpretations , p. 117). But Stevens only appears to be an aesthete, to be making acceptable (life passes like dew) that which is ugly (noontime deaths of the young). The aestheticizing is not his, as interpreted by, for example, Yvor Winters, but it is satirical mimicry: "When his [Browning's] heroes are blinded by passion and warped by circumstance, as they almost always are, he does not describe the fact from the vantage-ground of the intellect and invite us to look at it from that point of view. On the contrary, his art is all self-expression or satire" ( Interpretations , p. 117). Stevens has imitated the language and methods of Whitman, Browning, and Emerson as described by Santayana: The method is, to penetrate by sympathy rather than to portray by intelligence. The most authoritative insight is not the poet's or the spectator's, aroused and enlightened by the spectacle, but the various heroes' own, in their moment of intensest passion. We therefore miss the tragic relief and exaltation, and come away instead with the uncomfortable feeling that an obstinate folly is apparently the most glorious and choiceworthy thing in the world. This is evidently the poet's own illusion, and those who do not happen to share it must feel that if life were really as irrational as he thinks it, it would be not only profoundly discouraging, which it often is, but profoundly disgusting, which it surely is not; for at least it reveals the ideal which it fails to attain, (p. 128) In sum, Stanza VII imitates Whitman, Browning, and Emerson in such a way as to suggest that when measured against absolute death an orgiastic Whitman may be silly, the persona of Browning facile, and the rhetoric of the Jehovan or Christian Emerson inadequate. Stanza VII is a satire of their attitudes as mediated by Santayana's chapters about them, and when understood as a satire of these poets, this stanza is very funny. Composed in relation to the questions by the daydreaming woman and the responses by the rational poet, it seeks to short- circuit both orgy and dew as fantasies to satisfy her desire for mystical certainties as may be found in mindless natural energy and sentimental natural cycles. Stevens' satire does not necessarily mean that he accepted Santayana's views of Whitman, Browning, and Emerson as dogma, but, at the least, that he was interested in using Santayana's attitudes and organization 27 "Blotched" occurs, with emphasis, in "The Comedian as the Letter C," in which What counted was mythology of self, Blotched out beyond unblotching. (p. 28)</page><page sequence="13">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 71 for the consistency in composing a longer serious poem. * * * * The third stanza of "Sunday Morning" is the most difficult of the eight. Its difficulty lies in the ways in which Stevens made both its familiar and less familiar words complex and obscure. Further, in the shift from the second stanza, which is one of the easiest in the poem to enjoy immediately, its complexity startles by its contrast. The stylistic shift from the easier second to the difficult third indicates the occurrence of a large-scale change in cultural history and, therefore, in the cultural episteme ; that is, there are changes in the flow and quality of sensations, in the intensity of desire for objects, and, therefore, ultimately, in the ratios of poetry and religion, which is to say, in this poem, the poet's response to the woman's desire for a special relation to divinity and paradise. Stevens' purpose is to refract the cultural period of Santayana's third chapter, "The Dissolution of Paganism"; his stanza's contrived syntax is used to represent those massive changes in the epoch of Western culture in which Classical paganism dissolved and Christianity was created and moved swiftly toward consolidation. The intellectual and poetic strains of this stanza are the result of Stevens' seeking to synthesize so much of Santayana's analysis of that ancient axial period of cultural dissolution and resolution into new relationships, all within the poetic fiction of a meditation by the truth-telling poet on this Sunday morning. It should be noted that the complexity of the third stanza has much in common with several other modern historicizing fictions whose authors sought to contrive a multiple perspective of that era, such as Ibsen's Emperor and Galilean and Pater's Marius the Epicurean. The cultural period of the easier Stanza II is pre-Homeric; hence, its style is clear and direct, as Santayana suggests: "But the intense imaginative vitality that must have preceded Homer and Hesiod, the prodigious gift of sympathetic observation to which we owe Zeus and Pan and all their endless retinue, was too glorious to last" (p. 38). "Even the gods of Nature inspired reverence and secured a cultus only as they influenced the well-being of man. . . . The vividness and persistence of the figures of many of the gods came from the fact that they were associated with institutions and practices which controlled the conception of them and kept it young" (pp. 20-21). The new epoch- shown in a pastoral scene, a series of events, and changing moods- is to be understood mainly in its new abstractions and its vague allegory. To indicate the "dissolution of paganism," Stanza III begins in an instant when immortal Greek Zeus becomes old Roman Jove. The loss of the pre-Homeric mutual resemblance and nearness of gods and men is represented by a Jove that lacks the earlier crucial confidence of pre-Homeric anthropmorphism, which, in Santayana's argument, is an important illusory and vivifying activity carried out by the imagination and which provides vitality and warmth, motion and emotion, to mythology and philosophy. This metamorphosis is followed by additional negatives representing the breakdown of that which was "too glorious to last," the loss of those proper human connections with nature, anthropomorphic, generative, and earthy: Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave</page><page sequence="14">72 Journal of Modem Literature Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind. (p. 67)28 The earlier gods had a presence among the humans, as indicated in the earlier poetry, but "Jove in the clouds . . . inhuman" seems merely an allegorical figure for nature, merely "impersonations of natural forces" ( Interpretations , p. 20). Jove can manifest himself in many ways, but this is "Jove in the clouds. " The character of the god must be studied in the manifestations of his chosen element; otherwise men might forget that, although the form of the god was poetical, his essence was a positive reality of the most practical kind. Zeus must still toss his ambrosial locks with a certain irritation, in order that we may recognise in him the rumblings of the sky; he must still be capable of wrath and deliberate malice, that his awful hand may be thought to have hurled the thunderbolt. ( Interpretations , p. 38) Zeus rumbles in the sky and hurls a thunderbolt; hence, "Jove [sits] in a cloud." If Stevens' Jove has the defect of being unearthly (an "inhuman birth," him "no mother suckled," "no land" moved his mind), then he is without substance and lacks vividness. In cultural history, he has been emptied of substance by the Stoics: "despite a reverential tone and an occasional reminiscence of the thunderbolts of Zeus, the Stoic's conscience knew how to scorn the moral nothingness of that blank deity to which his metaphysics had reduced the genial company of the gods. . . . Finally, little remained of the gods except their names, reduced to rhetorical synonyms for the various departments of Nature . . . "( Interpretations , p. 41).29 Stevens' Jove is no longer of the earth even if he is able to come down to it. He moved among us , as a muttering king, Magnificent, would move among his hinds. ... (p. 67, emphasis added) "All that we may fairly imagine to have been in the mind of the pious singer is the sense that something divine comes down among us in the crises of our existence, and that this visitation is fraught with immense although vague possibilities of both good and evil" ( Interpretations , p. 33). No longer as powerful as Zeus, Jove, a "blank deity," is less than Lear-like, a "muttering king," when he "comes down among us" ( Interpretations , p. 33), "among his hinds." "Hinds" are usually defined as animals, a usage which Stevens found in Santayana's 28 Some details in these three lines of the poem are taken from the corresponding chapter in Santayana: the name "Jove" appears in a quotation of a Homeric hymn, in a translation by Shelley ( Interpretations , p. 34); "No mother suckled him" is found in the story of Demeter who, as nurse to Demophon, "neither suckles nor feeds the infant but anoints him with ambrosia ..." (p. 28); and the word "hinds" also appears here (p. 27). 29 It should be noted: that Santayana liked the phrase "local habitations," repeating it in several of his works: he took it from Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream , from the Act V speech of Theseus beginning "More strange than this . . that Stevens argues with in the poem, "'All things imagined are of earth compact . . (written 1913- 15?, Opus Posthumous , p. 13); that a major production of Midsummer Night's Dream was performed in New York in the spring of 1915, around the time that he wrote "Sunday Morning" (written spring? 1915); and that, of course, the play lent a name and other matters to "Peter Quince at the Clavier" (written summer? of 1915).</page><page sequence="15">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 73 translation of the Hymn to Demeter M "As hinds or heifers gambol in the fields/ When Spring is young" ( Interpretations , p. 27); "hinds" may be female "red deer" ("deer" appear in Stanza VIII) and "heifers" are "young cows." "Hinds," as given in the OED , also means "farm laborers," or peasants; "hinds" as "peasants" is Shakespeare's most frequent use of the word. Use of the one word to mean "humans" and to suggest "animals" adds to the obscurity of this stanza. The male divinity Jove, moving among his farmers and/or his female deer and cows, "among his hinds," recalls a pastoral tradition and stories associated, for example, with Ovid's Metamorphoses. Ovid's Metamorphoses and the earlier three Gospels, with their own idea of a Bibically-derived god as a shepherd, are nearly contemporary texts, that is, written within a period of about seventy-five years; both reflect a cultural epoch in which gods and humans are in intimate contact (as the Emperor Augustus proclaimed himself a god at approximately the time of the birth of Jesus). Until our blood, commingling, virginal, With heaven, brought such requital to desire The very hinds [=peasants] discerned it, in a star. (p. 68) Together, Stevens' "blood," "virginal," "heaven," "hinds "=peasants, maybe =animals, and "star" are some of the terms associated with the epiphany of the birth of Jesus, without saying as much. That is, the dissolution of the Roman mythology and ideology is simultaneous with the beginning of the new integrations of Christianity and the dispensations of Christian dogma. Santayana draws together the Classical and the Biblical worldviews and several times practices such comparisons. For example, he writes that the ancient pagan priests and their forms of worship "were the Greek representatives of the religion of revelation and of sacraments, and bore much the same relation to the supernaturalistic elements in Christianity as does the idea of a shade in Hades to the idea of a soul in heaven. The fundamental intuitions were the same, but in Pagan times they remained vague, doubtful, and incoherent" ( Interpretations , p. 35). In contrast to the abstract Jove, Stevens uses a figure for sources of vitality, "our [human] blood" that "brought such requital," a reward or a return, for its own desires. That is, the influences of human vitality and imagination and desire were so strong that the peasants in this epoch could sense effects in a star.30 We may wonder whether this is possible, whether the intelligence that is present in human blood can project a universe proper to itself, a universe in which both animals and gods are humanized. "When natural phenomena are conceived as the manifestation of divine life, human life itself, by sympathy with that ideal projection of itself, enlarges its customary bounds, until it seems capable of becoming the life of the universe" {Interpretations , p. 33). Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be The blood of paradise? And shall the earth Seem all of paradise that we shall know? (p. 68) 30 For an interesting supplement to these lines, see "Nuances of a Theme by Williams" {Collected Poems , p. 18).</page><page sequence="16">74 Journal of Modem Literature If we humans are to build this universe without an aged Jove, we will make a sky that is "friendlier" to ourselves, one which is a renewal of anthropomorphic sky-projections. "Sky" personified as a divinity recalls the pre-Homeric Cronos, Saturn, and Zeus, who, when evoked as "indifferent," are become a "blank deity," Jove. After Zeus and the Biblical eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, there were Adam-like "labor" and Eve-like "pain" of the earth followed by the Stoic cloudy Jove and by Christ-like heavenly "idealism." "So the lovely pantheon of the Greeks yielded in time," writes Santayana, "to analysis and was dissolved into abstract science and conscious fable. So, too, the body and soul of later religions may come to be divided, when they render back to earth what they contain of positive history and to the heaven of man's indomitable idealism, what they contain of aspiration and hope" (p. 49). The sky will be much friendlier then than now, A part of labor and a part of pain, And next in glory to enduring love, Not this dividing and indifferent blue. (p. 68) Santayana' s retrospective turn to the Greeks and his prophecy of the Christians suggest that an alternative is possible which is not merely the transference of priests and forms of worship without a change from paganism to Christianity. The past of the "then" in Santayana's "Gods and men were then nearer together, and both yielded more frankly to the tendency, inherent in their nature, to resemble one another" {Interpretations , p. 26) becomes Stevens' future "then," "The sky will be much friendlier then than now. ..." The sky will be revitalized by human desire and imagination, by what is carried by the "blood," and thereby it will reward desire ("requited"). This positive alternative to paganism and Christianity is found in Santayana's Aristotelianism, indicated in his discussion of metereological ("Jove in the clouds") mythologies (p. 40). It is well-known that Stevens saw in Santayana's epistemology an alternative to paganism and Christianity. Stevens presents in one stanza- the third, corresponding to the third chapter's "Dissolution of Paganism"- an historical sequence. In it, the earlier history is recalled but now with a name-change to indicate aging (Zeus becomes Jove); it is joined with "friendlier," "labor," "pain," "glory," and "love" and "blood," "virginal," "heaven," "hinds"=peasants (=animals) and "star," whose connotation as a group forms a pattern suggesting the Biblical terms of Genesis and the Pauline second Eve and Adam in a "visitation" "fraught with immense although vague possibilities of both good and evil" ( Interpretations , p. 33). Stevens' Golden Bough- like layering of the text- with references to Greek and Roman mythology and theophany and with allusions to Hebrew Genesis and Christian Gospel- emphasizes the potentialities of these words in the stanza that are similar to what Christian exegetes found in Virgil's Fourth Eclogue.31 While nothing of the Christian Bible appears in the Fourth Eclogue, all may be, and has been, interpreted as Christian prophecy. Virgil's poem appears to prophesy that after an Iron Age, a time of "dissolution," will begin a Golden Age, in the 31 Virgil, Eclogues , Georgics, Aeneid ¡-VI, trans. H. Rushton Fairclough (Loeb Library: Harvard University Press, 1956, rev. ed.), pp. 396-45.</page><page sequence="17">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 75 birth of a special boy and an age of peace and plenty, with a "friendlier sky." Stevens knew thoroughly his Virgil as well as such Christianizing legends surrounding the Fourth Eclogue, and he knew that in important ways what the Roman poet did accidentally his third stanza was seeking to present consciously. There are enough coincidences of his third stanza and the Fourth Eclogue to justify a pause to consider the possibility that Stevens made direct use of Virgil here. In Santayana the "dissolution of paganism"- re-stated most tersely by Stevens in the devolving or weakening of "Zeus" into "Jove"- was, in Virgil, in the period of decadence, the Age of Iron about to end, the evolving of Saturn into lovis (Jove). It is the time of the virgin ("wzrgo"), as this moment is "virginal"; a "descent from heaven" (" caelo demittitur alto"), as "Jove," a metonymy for "heaven," did descend to be "among us." There are "she- goats" (" capellae ") and cattle or herds, or "hinds" (=female deer, cows); and the "ploughman" ("robustus arator") or "hinds" (=farmers, peasants). And as the Fourth Eclogue indicates a better future, so Stanza III concludes by implying that, ultimately, the correct future lies not in Christianity as such but in understanding the epistemological basis for the content of the shift from paganism to Christianity that follows Santayana in what Aristotle had to offer, leading to an undivided, non-dissociated, existence with a "friendlier sky." Santayana writes, Aristotle had spoken of an intelligence, happy and self-contemplative, who was the principle of movement in the heavens, and through the heavens in the rest of Nature. Such expressions had a sound far too congruous with Mosaic doctrine not to be seized upon with joy by the apologists of the new faiths. . . . Aristotle first constructed this ideal, not out of his fancy, but by building on the solid ground of human nature and following to their point of union the lines which moral aspiration and effort actually follow. . . . Thus Aristotle's God is not superfluous, not invented. This theology is a true idealism, I mean an idealism itself purely ideal, which establishes the authority of human demands, ethical, and logical, without impugning the existence or efficacy ofthat material universe which it endows with a meaning and a standard, (pp. 44, 46, 47) As the Harvard Advocate reviewer of Interpretations of Poetry and Religion put it: For anyone a little God-weary ... the book, with its simple Aristotelianism, will be at the same time a stimulus and a relief. To such an one, drowsy with the warm scent of mystic Ones and transcendent Experiences in which all differences are merged, the eminently sane and rational view of life and its meaning which Mr. Santayana sets forth will come as a breath of clear cold air. Thus will come about, not a Golden Age, but a better age. In Stanza III, Stevens enacts in the personal meditation of "Sunday Morning" the cultural crisis of the "dissolution of paganism." Jesus, implied as the divinity of the next epoch, and the Christian institutions will establish a transcendent "enduring love" and obviously still not satisfy the daydreaming</page><page sequence="18">76 Journal of Modem Literature woman's desire for permanence. Not until Stanza VIII does Stevens give a full positive response to the woman's desires and questions. * * * * Because Santayana's chapters form a chronology covering idiosyncratically nearly three thousand years, a strong implication is that each corresponding stanza of "Sunday Morning" must be understood in relation to the history of the cultural epoch discussed in each chapter. Robert Buttel notes the signs of a different historical dimension in the allusions and thought in the poem: "Sunday Morning" "takes on depth and a sense of the sweep of time through the references to Jesus, Jove, and the pagan worshippers of the earth and sun."32 Helen Vendler suggests to her students that the poem has a broad "three-stage cultural progress."33 Neither Buttel nor Vendler appears to have followed his or her own leads to survey the poem's comprehensive sweep of cultural history. There are many signs of this cultural chronology. A list of words and phrases in each stanza in squence hints at it: II: "passions of rain," III: "Jove"; IV: "gat," V: "maidens who were wont to sit and gaze"; VI: "insipid lutes," VII: "heavenly fellowship," and VIII: "ambiguous undulations."34 One of the problems in Stevens criticism is that the critics have listened in the depths for rumblings of Milton and Keats and missed the gentle engines of Santayana on the surface. In Stanza I, "Complacencies of the peignoir," and Chapter 1 of Santayana, "Understanding, Imagination, and Mysticism": Stevens' stanza re-presents the chapter's epistemology in "hieroglyphs of sense" ( interpretations , p. 7) and shifts from sensation to understanding, then to the imagination's dreaming of "the dark/ encroachment of that old catastrophe," and finally to the problem of sacrificial asceticism in religion, or mysticism, the "Dominion of the blood and sepulchre." Its epistemology suggests the ways in which humans know along with what they come to know. Hence, this stanza presents experience, preceding and superceding the subtextual historical and cultural signs in the other stanzas. The "old catastrophe" of Sunday morning, that of the repetition of institutional religious sacrifice, stirs in the woman's moods a call for spiritual self-sacrifice, for an asceticism that demands a sacrifice, a hushing, of her senses, that Interpretations of Poetry and Religion repeatedly rejects. In Stanza II, "Why should she give her bounty to the dead?" and Chapter 2, "The Homeric Hymns" of the pre-Homeric epoch: the very early Greek (with an interesting connection to the discussion later of the "Shakespearean") worldview possesses direct, human-centered, feelingftil responses to nature. Emotions and nature are intertwined, mutually reinforcing, for example, "Passions of rain," with "passions" intending more the association with Greek 32 Buttel, p. 240. Helen Vendler, "Wallace Stevens: Teaching the Anthology Pieces," in Teaching Wallace Stevens : Practical Essays, ed. John H. Serio and B.J. Leggett (University of Tennessee Press, 1994, Tennessee Studies in Literature Vol 35), p. 7. 34 A summary, with approximately one stanza of the poem for one chapter of the book (further details would show that several stanzas extend beyond the edges of the chapters; Stevens often overlaps chapters by applying some statement given in the immediately prior chapter to the next stanza- an example is given in the earlier discussion of "Apollo"), can indicate the poem's consistency. Each brief entry, requiring longer arguments, can indicate only very broadly the match of each stanza's construction and each chapter's complex cultural interpretations. The summary, which needs to be held next to the poem to see its full application, attends to its superficial and most audible tones, listening for those resonances in the poem whose source may be Santayana's Interpretations of Poetry and Religion.</page><page sequence="19">A Pretext for "Sunday Morning" 77 passivity and emotions than with the Christian Crucifixion. This stanza does not mention any god but has a lexicon of potentially religious meanings; hence, it is experience occurring before religious hypostasis and institutional worship. Obviously, this Greek, or pre-Homeric, stage precedes the Roman. In Stanza III, "Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth," and Chapter 3, "The Dissolution of Paganism": the aging of the Greek Zeus into a Roman Jove signals the breakdown and emptying of the vitality of its ancient pagan naturalism. The stanza's movements of Jove from clouds to earth to sky again are analogous to Santayana's view of the Roman gods, detached from nature, expressing in abstract notions the atrophy of strong feelings. Its spatial and logical movements mime the Fail of Adam and Eve and anticipate the descending incarnation and rising death of Jesus. In Stanza IV, "She says, 'I am content when wakened birds,'" and Chapter 4 of Santayana, "The Poetry of Christian Dogma": the stanza's Scriptural-sounding "gat them home" reduces the varied interests of Christian dogma to "paradise" and "prophecy," with a humorous inventory of Classical and Christian locales for living life-after-death, such as a Floridian "palm / Remote on heaven's hill" (p. 68). The poet asserts that no mystical or prophetic place endures as well as do memories based on the actual. Santayana's broad-jump of a thousand years in his Interpretations is repeated by Stevens's leap over a thousand years in "Sunday Morning." This jump and another shorter, but noticeable after the next chapter, are identical in "Sunday Morning"- a clear sign, albeit negative, the stanzas' conforming to the chapters. In Stanza V, "She says, 'But in contentment, I still feel," and Chapter 5, "Platonic Love in Some Italian Poets": Santayana's selection of poets emphasizes their repeated experience of the death of the beloved, such as Dante's of Beatrice, and their confidence in an imagined posthumous union. Platonism's permanent truths appear, only appear, to satisfy hopeless needs as in "the need of some imperishable bliss." For his scene of eros , Stevens has used a seeming cultural anachronism of seventeenth-century French paintings of the genre of the landscape of the fêtes galantes and Arcadia as variants of the Keatsian Grecian and erotic pursuit. That this is more a substitution than an anachronism needs a separate and lengthier explanation including Stevens' special affinity for the fêtes galantes in painting and for romance literature. In Stanza VI of the poem, "Is there no change of death in paradise?" and Chapter 6 of the book, "The Absence of Religion in Shakespeare": this stanza's cultural period uses an antique and feudal language in its Elizabethan "wear our colors there" and "insipid lutes." It is Shakespearean in its following Interpretations' $ presentation of the poet himself as a character and in its dramatization of the contradictions of Shakespearean paradox; it is not a clear assertion of Stevens' desire for some kind of worldly Platonism, "mystical," yet with the poet's "absence of religion." After these epochs, another two hundred and fifty years are ignored in both Santayana and "Sunday Morning," leaping from the Elizabethan period to the middle of the nineteenth century. In Stanza VII, "Supple and turbulent, a ring of men," and Chapters 7 and 8, "The Poetry of Barbarism" ("barbarism" means merely responding to sensations without elevating apperceptions to a higher mode of understanding) and "Emerson": the opening Whitmanesque scene might be confused with the pre-Homeric unity of nature and emotion, as in Stanza II. But, in II, experience is pre-worship and responds emotionally to nature in all seasons; in VII, it is charged with pseudo-worship and draws down the sun in its positivist or mechanical</page><page sequence="20">78 Journal of Modem Literature nakedness. Stanza VII also uses Chapter 8: "Emerson," in the idea of "the heavenly fellowship" of the Transcendentalists, invoking a preconceived nature only to reproject it to minister sentimentally to themselves. In Stevens' final stanza, VIII, "She hears, upon that water without sound," and Chapters 9, "A Religion of Disillusion," and 10, "The Elements and Function of Poetry": this stanza follows Santayana with both an acceptance of the nothingness of death and a depiction of everyday nature and transient beauty. Disillusion is a "tomb in Palestine" that "is not the porch of spirits lingering." Its religion is emptied of illusions of permanence and false metaphysics without its being submerged in the century's positivism and scientism; it retains its own calm pessimism. Its phrase "ambiguous undulations" echoes Emerson's "great principle of Undulation,"35 but now it is associated with a (seemingly) unsentimental Euro- Hinduism. Chapter 1 O's discussions of poetically generalized landscapes are especially relevant to this stanza's generalized and idealized landscape (with its several roots in Virgil's Eclogues). In sum, the cultural chronology of "Sunday Morning" is idiosyncratic and miscellaneous and fits closely the idiosyncracies of the "miscellaneous" collection of Interpretations of Poetry and Religion. The consistency of the parallels of the poem and the book suggests strongly that Steven made use of this book and not some other cultural survey by some author or, for that matter, another by Santayana;36 he used its organization and its ideas regarding poetry and religion to organize his longer serious poem as well to exploit components along the way. With "Sunday Morning" indeed informed by Interpretations of Poetry and Religion , many questions follow, from Stevens' techniques for initiating poetic attitudes, through his transforming use of other people's ideas and words, as well as his relation to Santayana. Much remains to be discovered. But it seems clear that "Sunday Morning" is informed, stanza after stanza, by chapter after chapter of Santayana' s Interpretations , which serves as a major pretext for his poem. 35 Ralph Waldo Emerson, "The American Scholar," in Essays and Lectures , ed.

It recalls Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit and not his History of Philosophy.</page></plain_text>
