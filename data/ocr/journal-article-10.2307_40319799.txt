<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bruce W. Wilshire William James, Phenomenology and Pragmatism: A Reply to Rosenthal In two valuable articles in this journal (Vol. X, Nos. 2 and 3, 1974), Sandra Rosenthal examines 'interdisciplinary' approaches to pragmatism, particularly phenomenological ones, and contends that they can both extend and clarify pragmatism and, at a certain point, deflect and distort its thrust. She places herself in the pragmatic camp, but is willing to concede that its boundaries are subject to revision under the impact of the phenomenological critique. Her grasp of Peirce and Lewis is particularly remarkable, and yet, refreshingly enough, she approaches Continental phenomenology with considerable imagination. She extends thinking in both camps, I think. I disagree, however, with some of her interpre- tations of William James, as well as of phenomenology, and I question certain elements in the pragmatism she espouses. Let the dialogue continue. Professor Rosenthal begins by agreeing with the position she cites in my William James and Phenomenology that James is unable to regard the thought- thought's object relation as an external and causal one, and that this reversal in his program in the Principles is salutary. She agrees, in effect, that both pragmatism and phenomenology cannot first set out to empirically discover the causes of thought in the material world because - given our ordinary contexts of description - the specification of a thought will have already involved a reference to its object. So it is internally linked to its object - an object which otherwise might have been regarded as its dynamical cause. We must return to the Lebenswelt, to thoughts described along with their objects, as the grounding level of all meaning, including that of science (p. 80). But pragmatism cannot be content with only a description of lived experience - as she implies phenomenology can - but requires an explanation of it as well. She writes, ". . . the relation between belief, habit and action is one both of a logical character and of causal efficacy.</page><page sequence="2">46 Bruce W. Wilshire Such complementary types of analyses are operative throughout prag- matism" (p. 89). Explanation for pragmatism must evidently include a causal aspect, whatever else it includes as "speculative description." With this we have a burning issue that confronts both camps: How can causal and cognitive analyses be complementary? Her approval of Mathur's rejection of a * 'transcendental" interpreta- tion of James, and her agreement that "experience is of as well as in nature" does not clarify this issue for phenomenology, nor, indirectly, for pragmatism. Alas, following Mathur, "transcendental" is taken in only one of its senses, that which singles out the thought of Husserl, rather than in the much more valuable sense that applies to all phenome- nology. The first sense expresses Husserl's conviction that all the salient aspects of our ordinary, lived experience, our active, pre-reflective involvement in the natural world, can be identified by reflective con- sciousness and placed within a field of disinterestedness in which the sheer meaning of all consciousness and its objects is intuited in isolation of all causal and existential theses. Of this reflective ego we might say that it is only of the world and not in it, and that to apply causal theses to it is to be confused. But other phenomenologists, such as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, do not think that there is any such purely detached reflective standpoint; all we can hope is to further clarify "hermeneutical- ly" an involvement with the natural world which we can never escape and completely objectify. The use of "transcendental" here is broader, and is exemplified even in the work of C. I. Lewis: it is assumed that ideas must be applicable to the world if knowledge is to be possible at all, and the question becomes how they can be applicable. While involved in the world, we try to discover how involvement which is cognitive is possible. Thus to place "transcendental" over against "existential" phenomenology is misleading (p. 81). For this latter approach the causal question might arise, and to understand how it could is a great problem. "Transcendental" becomes as negatively loaded a term in Rosenthal's account as "experimental" is positively loaded, and both terms must be de-fused before we can confront the issue of whether James' approach is similar to existential phenomenology (which she denies, p. 81). Rosenthal approves of my analysis of James' view of sensation as highly discriminated (and perhaps fantasied) aspects of things sensed, achieved through a peculiar way of looking at the thing: we see the thing, as it "feels" (p. 82). So sensations cannot be the "building</page><page sequence="3">William James, Phenomenology and Pragmatism: A Reply to Rosenthal 47 blocks" of the world, since such data are lifted out by abstraction from a world already there and experienced as such in ordinary life. Sensa- tions are essentially worldly in reference. Now for James this peculiar way of looking is associated with his interests as an artist: to grasp the world in its sensational aspect; to cut away - as much as possible - intellectualized interpretations of the world (which are not necessarily false, nor if true only superficially so) . Even in the ostensibly empirical context of the Principles he despairs of causally correlating these "minimal" facts of consciousness with "mini- mal" states of the brain, because large sections of the brain seem to be involved in all mental activity. He develops no thesis that "minimal" equals "most fundamental" or "primordial."1 But Rosenthal, who tends to equate "pragmatism" with the thought of C. I. Lewis (and Peirce), will link the minimal with the most primordial; it is the clue to the hypothesized "given" - the "independently real" as it first obtrudes upon us (in our experience but not intuitable as in it). Minimal con- scious experience is the "thin" bridge over which the "thick" experience of the world (in which phenomenologists allegedly cannot extricate themselves) is explained in terms of the idealized "given" which "underlies" all consciousness. "(T)hin experience . . . post-analytic data ... or appearances of objectivities" are a "verification level" for philosophical hypotheses about the "idealized experience of pure immediacy, of sheer contact of organism and environment." (p.84) Now it might be thought that such sense data are a fit level of verification only for scientific hypotheses, say of psycho-physics (e.g., experiments on the reaction time of consciousness). But the ideal of experimentalism has spread here to metaphysics, and we must ask, "Yes, it is not a directly observable matter, and it is a metaphysical hypothesis, but is it a good metaphysical hypothesis, or the best one?" It seems suspiciously like a metaphysical commitment which is, ironically, subjectivistic and atomistic - a commitment which can be criticized phenomenologically.2 The intentional reference of "primordial" experience to the experienceable world (Lebenswelt) , and hence the control of lived-experience over the concept of experience as "primordial," is questionable.3 For all of James's experimentations he does not seem to be an experi- mentalist in Rosenthal's preferred sense. His radical empiricism grew directly, if incompletely, from his view in the Principles of the world of practical realities as a founding level of meaning. He wants to speak of</page><page sequence="4">48 Bruce W. WiLSHiRE experiences neutral between mind and matter, thus constitutive of both, which are pure in the sense of being thats that are not any whats at all. But he realizes that this is an unexperienceable so un verifiable hypothesis, hence a view that cannot be adopted by his radical empiricism. All he can pin down are experiences already beginning "to fill themselves with emphases," with whats.4 "Pure experience" is a nascent network of intelligibility, of interpretation; it is only a quasi-chaos. His classic analysis of human activity, for example, is vividly anti-reductionistic and phenomenological. He turned the tables on those who charged him with anthropomorphism. What we mean primarily by "cause" is just the intimate experience within ourselves of initiation of activity and striving, and any theory which projects this sense out of the context in which it is known and into "the cubic deeps" beyond intuitable experience amounts to an illicit displacement of human traits into non-human contexts.5 The contrast with Lewis is not insignificant. He describes the "given" as "a chaos," as if it were the prime-matter which must be postulated as the counterpart of the pure form of the concepts applied pragmatically a prior/.6 And then what is organized by these concepts, since it might have been organized differently, is accorded an epistemic reality only. In another place Rosenthal has reconstructed in a revealing way Lewis's ultimate metaphysics.7 He appropriates Peirce's three categories as super categories to be used to understand our ordinary epistemological cate- gories, our ordinary understanding of the world as interacted-with (a world composed of individuals and their qualities) . Interaction is under- stood on the assumption that "thin experience," being most nearly pri- mordial and basic, is the clue to the link between the "independently real" and personal experience, the "given." Now, why ought we to accept this assumption? His ultimate metaphysics might be the only way to account for this account of knowing, but isn't the latter subjectivistically biased to begin with? Lewis construes "independently real" as transcending the content of any particular experience. It is just general potentialities or probable behaviors of things which can do this. Here is Peirce's thirdness. Ingeniously, Lewis argues that predictive knowledge is possible only on the assump- tion that not all possibilities can be realized at once.8 This is that which obtrudes upon us, actuality, or secondness. Mere possibility, or deviation from probability, is firstness. Individual things experienced "in the (epistemic) world" seem to be the potentialities of independently real</page><page sequence="5">William James, Phenomenology and Pragmatism: A Reply to Rosenthal 49 processes merely insofar as they are relative to the sensory constitution of man (the universe "in itself" is just shifting gradations of intensity in a "sea" of process and energy). But just how the universe is so relative as to "give rise" to conscious experience through the "underlying given," is not clear to me at all. Shouldn't this imply a causal connection? But I see not even a coherent sketch of a theory for the prediction of particular sense data via the mediation of the given. In its absence we are left with the suspicion that the assumption about the primordiality of the given, while not in- compatible with the ultimate categories, is not indispensable either. And it seems to conceal the possibility that the thought-thought's object and self-world relationship is much different from what Lewis says it is, e.g., more complex primordiali)'. (We leave aside now the question of the determinacy of the categories themselves, and of how it is shown how they, and only they, are "illustrated" in all experience.) The literary terms "underlie" and "give rise to" must be cashed philo- sophically. Until they are we must suspect that the "ultimately real" is excessively remote just because it is the only corrective for a view of the self and its "epistemic" activity which is excessively "near" and subjective to begin with. Why shouldn't we suppose that the most primordial categories - whatever they are - mediate the most pri- mordial experiences, but that these are ab ovo interpreted experiences, i.e., ones of the world of individual things and processes? Rosenthal writes, "Metaphysics is a speculative hypothesis which offers an 'explanation' of lived experience by providing a 'speculative des- cription' of the features of that process which presents itself in the im- mediacy of organism-environment interaction, which is 'open to' certain meanings, and which is known only through such meanings" (p. 175^). But how does the process of lived experience present itself in the im- mediacy of organism-environment interaction? It is just this that I cannot make evident to myself - to use the phenomenological terms. What are the meanings which the process is open-to and in terms of which it must be known? I can select-out through an odd way of looking the "minimal" experiences that present themselves in perception as pertaining to a thing before me now, but why think that I have spent time(!) isolating-out something immediate? Why are they immediate and the interpreted "maximal experiences" not? A person who interprets takes time to interpret a message, so the word "interpreted" may suggest some-</page><page sequence="6">50 Bruce W. Wilshire thing derivative and of later occurrence. But I do not see that this analogy is justified in the context of our present discussion. And when I reflect I can make no sense out of "that which presents itself in the immediacy of organism-environment interaction." The organism can respond to the environment and stop short of producing any feeling or any experience. Think of an unfelt response of a toe to anything you like. If it is objected that all immediate interaction needn't involve experience, but all experience that is primordial is involved in immediate interaction, then that is the assumption I fail to see demonstrated. If James and other physiological psychologists are right, the proximate or immediate cause of personal experience is only the brain, and this is within the organism, so not part of the environment at all. To suppose that what occurs at the immediate intersection of organism and environ- ment must be that which * 'underlies" personal experience suggests a latent and unwitting dualism of mind and matter, subject and object, hovering in the theory: mind, what's personal and private "in here," looks out at a world "out there." Such a vestigial dualism seems at work in Peirce's and Lewis's view that the only bridge between personal experience and the independently real that a scientific functionalist can take is the immediately perceived (or its idealized correlate, the "given"). Ironically, it seems subjectivistic. We need phenomenology to criticize this idea of immediacy of organism-environment interaction within personal experience. Without phenomenology metaphysical ghosts slip into the most "scientific" philosophies. How, conceivably, could this immediate interaction be evident to any observer, give him the most penetrating powers of observation and of thought you wish? Modes of being, if they are to be reliably described, must be correctable in some way to modes of being presented to consciousness. Rosenthal writes, "In brief, the 'would-be' of a metaphysics of prag- matism is meaningful because it is rooted in lived experience. And, the pervasive features of lived experience are rooted in the pervasive features of what is independently there to be experienced" (p. 177). Presumably the first "rooted in" connotes a cognitive and internal rela- tion only. It requires an analysis which she believes can be given but which "falls beyond the scope of this paper": "analysis ... of felt habit or disposition to respond as it operates as the unifying factor within the internal structure of conceptual relationship" (fn. #65). The analysis certainly must be supplied. The second "rooted in" must connote</page><page sequence="7">William James, Phenomenology and Pragmatism: A Reply to Rosenthd 51 something different if it is to have any dynamically causal sense at all. There must be some way of specifying the identity of the independently real independently of specifying the lived experience as an individual experiencing, even if we should grant that all of experience is "per- vaded" by the same categories as "pervade" the independently real. Thus experiencing would have to be specified in terms of the experienced. But the extreme generality of the categories may allow the causal relata to fall out independently in some description of them. There is little reason to think that the "given" as advanced by Lewis is an adequate causal base for experience in its apparently primordial fullness, and yet that the base, whatever it is both proximally and approximally, be hypothesized and idealized in some responsible way may be required for conceptual independence and an external relationship. These are problems which have to be ironed-out if causal-cognitive confusions are to be avoided, and the control of concepts by experience effected. But at long last - we should not think that because the single name "pragmatist" has been applied to James and the others that there is one body of thought to which all subscribe. Too many commentators have believed that James is just defective or careless when he differs from his allegedly more sophisticated colleagues. They try to push him back into line. This is a failure of both analytic and human judgment. James truly is a "nominalist" if by this one means one who takes important excep- tion to Peirce's general would-be's, his "realism." For James, one's individuality is irreducible, and this is not merely a matter of one's irreducible ignorance or error, as it was for Peirce. The person directly knows his unique self through acquaintance (John Wild best made this important point) . Of the pragmatists it is only James who penetrates to what Kierkegaard called the inner man where fear and trembling begin (viz., the story of Abraham who is called upon by God - singled out - to kill his son: is it sacrifice, or is it murder?) * Ethical responsibility absolutely individuates - no one else is responsible for my behavior. And not only is individuality irreducible, but so is the world as indi- vidually experienced - even though intersubjectively valid necessary truths play an essential role. All this does place James close to existential phenomenology. 10 Rosenthal gives an account of John Wild's rendering of James's notion ot apriori truth, and affirms that Wild distinguishes two types of apriori, a. "testable" and an "existential apriori" (p. 166). This seems to be an error. Wild is using two different names for the same concept.</page><page sequence="8">52 Bruce W. Wilshire The existential apriori must be testable in whatever way is philosophically appropriate. Hence Rosenthal does not see the strong affinity between the phenomenological view and Lewis's on this point. She is further misled in thinking that the existential apriori applies only to meanings, not to things in their "otherness" - things to which the pragmaic apriori supposedly applies - pp. 168-9 (although, if something evidentially inadequate is meant by "otherness" or "independently real," there may be an important difference in the approaches here). But this need not be an exclusive disjunction. We refer to things through meanings (par- ticularly when Wild speaks of "perceptual meanings"), and the neces- sity applies both to the meanings and the things meant. Both existential phenomenology and Lewis with his notion of an apriori of "sense mean- ings" are affirming an absoluteness in "coerciveness over thought" which distinguishes their view from the conventionalism of positivism (p. 169). Unlike positivism, the apriori is not neatly segregable in the form of mathematics and logic; there is also an apriori "that underlies all empirical knowledge" (p. 170). n This is an immensely important point, but it should not blind us to another: that for both James and Lewis necessary truths with empirical import are testable and modifiable in history - which would not be denied by certain phenomenologists. Hence it is misleading to say flatly, "The pragmatic apriori cannot be assimilated to the apriori of the phenomenological perspective" (p. 171). This affinity of the two approaches to philosophy has been slighted because, in part, of the positively loaded terms "scientific" and "experi- mental" in "pragmatism." The model of science misleads us to think that all apriori projections are like deliberate theorizings and experimenta- tions (and she speaks of the tenuous relationship of phenomenology to "conceptual pragmatism." (p. 168) "Conceptual"?) "The model of scientific knowledge provides the model for all knowledge," she writes. I think it is very dangerous to say that. Apriori reasonings examined within transcendental investigations are simply not verified like straight- forward hypotheses in science. A questionable view of sensations as possibly predictable psychic entities contributes to this kind of thinking.12 Then there is the negatively loaded term "transcendental." Rosenthal should give us an account of how Lewis's view is a transcendental one (i.e., because he transcendentally deduces what must be true of the world if knowledge is to be possible) . Of course, there is at least one genuine difference in approach. She writes that the testable apriori (in the form of an "intentionally polarized</page><page sequence="9">William James, Phenomenology and Pragmatism: A Reply to Rosenthal 53 perception* ') is not * 'given" in experience at its most fundamental level for the pragmatist, but rather it emerges via interpretation" (p. 169). But I have already questioned the equation of "most fundamental" with "uninterpreted," and denied that the "pragmatist" James makes that assumption. I freely concede the equation to some of the other "prag- matists." The concept of "independently real" must be related to the pri- mordial intentionality of mind if it is to be intelligible. Not only does this not render a causal explanation of experience impossible, it is necessary for it to be possible. All talk of "brute breaking in upon one, " "interruption," "groping to grasp what has happened" presuppose an "independent" world of things than can interrupt us; it presupposes the relation of that world to us. We can select concepts for things only when we select what must be selected (intended) as "not selectable at will," the "intrinsic" and "what must be acknowledged" (p. 177). But Rosenthal's articles are very valuable indeed. They would be justified if all they did was force phenomenologists to think hard about description involving causal explanation. Phenomenologists (e.g., Mer- leau-Ponty) have insisted that to speak intelligibly of the world we must speak of things as experienceable to some degree, but to so speak of them we must have related them internally to ourselves and to mind. Hence, since a causal relationship presupposes an external relationship between the relata, the basic relationship cannot be a causal one. But we need only insist that the intentional relationship is irreducibly internal as a relationship; we can leave open the possibility that the elements are also related in other ways, e.g., causally (// there is a specification of the conditions of identity of each that does not refer to the other). This seems absurd only when we forget this possibility, and only when, ironically, we think of the causal relationship after the model of the cognitive, and think that the object itself as known, which must be cited to specify the knowing, is by itself (and as so specified) sufficient to cause the knowing. At best it is a necessary condition em- bedded in a matrix of emergent and standing necessary conditions, some of which must be elements of one's own body, e.g., the brain.1^ Just what would count as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions to pro- duce the effect is a very difficult matter. But metaphysically we should not shut down the possibility thoughtlessly or prematurely.14 A description of experience may be the first stage of an analysis which develops a causal thrust. All we need imply when we say that the</page><page sequence="10">54 Bruce W. Wilshire cognitive analysis is prior to the causal is that we must avoid a causal explanation that is inadequate descriptively from the start - and that is just what we normally get in Humean, classical causal explanations. The causal explanation compatible with phenomenology would acknowledge in its own way the "independence" of the world; but I see no reason why it need be incompatible with a "pragmatic specula- tion" via categories, as long as this is purged of questionable causal (and atomistic) elements, and as long as we can tie "speculation" to evidential clarity. Sometimes phenomenologists blur founding and constituting conditions. If any case can be made for phenomenology's being weak in its explanation of experience, then a case can be made for a scientism in pragmatism that weakens some of its descriptions. Pragmatism and phenomenology should be seen as mutually assisting philosophical efforts, and Rosenthal has helped us see this. Her work should help silence those who think that comparative studies must be superficial. Rutgers University NOTES 1. He sometimes speaks of the sensation "itself" as the "real being" of it, but he develops no thesis here, e.g. no thesis of it as a "given," and he also says that its "fringes" (cut away in the odd way of looking) are "bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh." See my William James and Phenomenology (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1968) p. 114 ff. 2. She describes the "felt datum" as "devoid of future reference" (p. 83) - an aspect apparently of its immediacy. Yet in a footnote she writes ,". . . however, interpretation is very much in evidence, since abstractive . . . attention is a type of interpretive process." We are left with the suspicion that "felt datum" is a (mis- guided) distinction of reason posing as an ontological distinction. 3. A critique of Lewis more ambitious than we can undertake here would try to make the following case: this initial failure of intentional reference constrains Lewis to explicate "independent reality" as that which makes possible the epistemo- logical situation in which alternative categories can be applied to given data to %'grvt rise" to "epistemic reality" (see Rosenthal, "Pragmatism and the Methodol- ogy of Metaphysics," The Monist, Vol. 57, 1973). Presumably this a a causal, or quasi-causal explanation of the given that does employ it as a "building block" of at least "epistemic reality." 4.

It is misleading for Charles Morris to cite James's allegiance to Peirce's thirdness (The Pragmatic Movement in American Philosophy, New York: George Braziller, 1970, p. 137, note 14), since James regards percepts as primordial and concepts as secondary, so his allegiance to "logical realism" is "somewhat eccen- tric," as he himself admits (Some Problems of Philosophy ; New York: Longmans Green &amp; Co., 1948, p. 106). By "percept" James means the flowing "much at once," and his admonition that we return to embrace it in the "flux of our hourly experience" (ibid., p. 109), suggests that continuity can just as much be a "first" as a "third." (By the way, does Peirce ever demonstrate that continuity can only be a "third"?) Indeed, Peirce's categories are so vague and abbreviated that something like them can be found in many philosophies never called pragmatisti they can hardly delimit a pragmatic philosophy. 11. I have previously made this point in William James: The Essential Writings (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1971), lviii-lx. 12. Perhaps there is a constancy hypothesis at work in Lewis's view, i.e.. the notion that a constant relationship obtains between physical conditions of the environment and psychical states (states however hypothesized). The constancy hypothesis has been damagingly criticized by Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty. 13. If there is an identity between thoughts and brain states, tnen this is meta- physically challenging in its own way. I do not think it need be handled in a reductionist manner (see my William James and Phenomenology, last chapter). 14.
