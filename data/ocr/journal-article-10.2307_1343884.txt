<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet Michael Fried Halfway through Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins, Jacques Derrida briefly considers several remarkable self-portrait draw- ings by the nineteenth-century French painter Henri Fantin-Latour (figs. 3, 4, 8). He does this in the context of a discussion of what he calls the "retrait transcendantal du trait"-the "transcendental retrait or withdrawal" of the trait (a basic term in Derrida's lexicon that carries a range of mean- ings, from a trait or feature to a line, stroke, or mark).' Roughly, the necessity of such a retrait follows from the inherently differential structure of the trait in Derrida's account. Because the trait, once drawn, ideally has no thickness but instead only marks the separation between the inside and outside of a figure ("the single edge of a contour"), it cannot strictly speaking manifest itself (MB, p. 53). In Derrida's words: "Nothing belongs to the trait, and thus, to drawing and to the thought of drawing, not even its own 'trace"' (MB, p. 54). And: "The outline or tracing separates and 1.

Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, under the title Memoirs of the Blind: The Self- Portrait and Other Ruins (Chicago, 1993), p. 57; hereafter abbreviated MB. The present essay (minus some of the material in the second half) was originally written as a lecture to be delivered in a French translation at a conference on Derrida's work since 1980 held at the Centre Culturel International de Cerisy-la-Salle, 11-21 July 1992. The general theme of that conference was a notion taken from Derrida's writings, "the crossing of borders," "le passage des frontieires"--hence its recurrence as a motif in these pages. My thanks to Marie- Louise Mallet, principal organizer of the colloquium, and to Jacques Derrida for permission to publish this essay in Critical Inquiry.

The experience or experimenting of drawing (and experimenting, as its name indicates, always consists in journeying be- yond limits) at once crosses and institutes these borders, it invents the Shibboleth of these passages" (MB, p. 54). And that "transcendental retrait or withdrawal" in turn calls for and forbids the self-portrait. Not that of the author and pre- sumed signatory, but that of the "source-point" of drawing, the eye and the finger, if you will. This point is represented and eclipsed at the same time. It lends itself to the autograph of this wink or clin d'oeil that plunges it into the night, or rather, into the time of this waning or declining day wherein the face is submerged: it gets car- ried away, it decomposes itself or lets itself be devoured by a mouth of darkness. Certain self-portraits of Fantin-Latour show this. Or rather, they would be the figures or the de-monstration of this. Sometimes invisibility is shared out [s'y partage], if one can say this, right between the two eyes. There is on the one hand [d'une part] the monocular stare of a narcissistic cyclops: a single eye open, the right one [this will be important], fixed firmly on its own image. It will not let it go, but that's because the prey necessarily eludes it, making off with the lure. The traits of a self-portrait are also those of a fascinated hunter. The staring eye always resembles an eye of the blind, some- times the eye of the dead, at that precise moment when mourning begins: it is still open, a pious hand should soon come to close it; it would recall a portrait of the dying. Looking at itself seeing, it also sees itself disappear right at the moment when the drawing tries des- perately to recapture it. For this cyclops eye sees nothing, nothing but an eye that it thus prevents from seeing anything at all. Seeing the seeing and not the visible, it sees nothing. This seeing eye sees itself blind. On the other hand [d'autre part], and this would be, as it were, the eye's nocturnal truth, the other eye is already plunged into the night, sometimes just barely hidden, veiled, withdrawn [en retrait], sometimes totally indiscernible and dissolved into a blotch, and sometimes absorbed by the shadow cast upon it by a top hat shaped like an eyeshade. From one blindness, the other. [MB, p. 57] Derrida goes on to say that Fantin-Latour's drawings epitomize what he tentatively names the "hypothesis of sight-or the intuitive hypothesis, the Michael Fried, Herbert Boone Professor of the Humanities at The Johns Hopkins University, is the author of several books, the most recent of which is Courbet's Realism (1990). His next works to appear will be To the Center of the Earth (a book of poems) and Manet's Modernism or the Face of Painting in the 1860s.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 3 hypothesis of intuition" (MB, p. 60). Derrida's point concerns the inescap- ableness of hypothesizing (of conjecturing, of presupposing) at the heart of the act of intuiting (of seeing, as it were immediately and without re- flection) the subject of Fantin-Latour's self-portrait drawings. For as Der- rida remarks, we can only conjecture that the protagonist of those drawings is actually delineating his own image as he perceives it in a mir- ror, thereby portraying himself in the act of making his self-portrait-the one before us. In fact we are shown neither the surface of the sheet of paper on which he is drawing nor the mirror itself, whose presumed place we occupy and which indeed we effectively replace and obscure, or as Derrida also says, which we make one blind to "by producing, by putting to work, the sought after specularity" (MB, p. 62). He continues: The spectator's performance, as it is essentially prescribed by the work, consists in striking the signatory blind, and thus in gouging out-at the same stroke-the eyes of the model, or else in making him, the subject (at once model, signatory, and object of the work), gouge out his own eyes in order both to see and to represent himself at work. If there were such a thing, the self-portrait would first consist in assigning, thus in describing, a place to the spectator, to the visitor, to the one whose seeing blinds; it would assign or describe this place following the gaze of a draftsman who, on the one hand, no longer sees himself, the mirror being necessarily replaced by the destinatory who faces him, that is, by us, but us who, on the other hand, at the very moment when we are instituted as spectators in (the) place of the mirror, no longer see the author as such, can no longer in any case identify the object, the subject, and the signatory of the self-portrait of the artist as a self-portraitist. In this self-portrait of a self-portrait, the figure or face of Fantin-Latour should be looking at us looking at him according to the law of an impossible and blinding reflexivity. In order to see himself or show himself, he should see only his two eyes, his own eyes-two eyes that he must, however, get over mourn- ing just as soon, and precisely in order to see himself, eyes that he must just as soon replace, to this end, with this representation in sight, and in (the) place of the mirror, by other eyes, by eyes that see him, by our eyes. [MB, p. 62] Derrida concludes further on: Even if one were sure that Fantin-Latour were drawing himself drawing, one would never know, observing the work alone, whether he were showing himself drawing himself or something else-or even him- self as something else, as other And he can always, in addition, draw this situation: the stealing away of what regards you, of what looks at you, of what fixedly observes you not seeing that with which or with whom you are dealing. Does the signatory himself see that which he makes you observe? Will he have seen it in some present? [MB, p. 65]</page><page sequence="4">4 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet I was struck by Derrida's remarks when I first read them both be- cause of their characteristic brilliance and subtlety and because the works they treat as exemplary-Henri Fantin-Latour's self-portrait drawings- were already of urgent interest to me. Let me say at once that the problematic I shall be exploring is not the same as Derrida's. I am not concerned with a transcendental logic of drawing ("the invisible condi- tion of the possibility of drawing" [MB, p. 41]) and hence shall not engage with his framing notion of the "transcendental retrait or withdrawal" of the trait. Rather, this essay is part of an explicitly historical project (one, how- ever, that is not devoid of quasi-transcendental implications),2 a study of the advent of modernist painting in France in the crucial decade of the 1860s. The central figure in that development was of course Edouard Manet, but one of my basic claims in a book I have recently completed called Manet's Modernism or the Face of Painting in the 1860s3 is that Manet's revolutionary achievement can be made historically intelligible only to the extent that he is seen as having belonged to a specific artistic genera- tion, which I call the generation of 1863 in honor of its moment of maxi- mum visibility, the Salon des Refuses of that year. The other artists whom I think of as constituting that generation along with Manet are Fantin- Latour, the expatriate American James McNeill Whistler, and a highly gifted painter and etcher who deserves to be much better known, Al- phonse Legros.4 All four were born between 1832 and 1837; one reason art historians have never fully appreciated the importance of treating them together is that they cohered as a group for only a short time. In 1863 Whistler decamped to London taking Legros with him (the pros- pects for sales and commissions were better there), and although both artists continued for a while to exhibit in Paris, the seeds of disunion were sown. Within a few years Whistler and Legros broke with one another, and Whistler repudiated his realist origins. Fantin in the meanwhile be- came more and more reclusive, leaving Manet virtually alone in the pub- lic arena. Another reason why the generation of 1863 has been slighted is that it was quickly succeeded by the most long-lived and stylistically coherent generation in all of modern art, the impressionists (Claude Monet, its leading figure, was born in 1840).5 Indeed the success of im- 2. The term quasi-transcendental occurs more than once in Memoirs of the Blind, and in fact has been used with some frequency by Derrida at least since Glas.

But I am already straying beyond the bounds of my topic in this essay. Or perhaps not. At any rate, I am concerned with a singular moment in the history of painting in France: the moment of the advent of modern- ist painting in the work of Manet but also of certain other developments, largely in "lesser" media, that are even less well understood, involving Manet's contemporaries Fantin-Latour, Whistler, and Legros. The mo- ment, in other words, is precisely one of a certain "crossing of borders": conceptually, from premodernist to modernist painting; as regards me- dium, from painting to drawing and etching (and back); and, as we shall see, from one mode of realism, associated with Gustave Courbet, to an- other, fundamentally different mode of realism, foreshadowing the im- pressionists. In addition, as Derrida's observations already suggest, the works we shall be looking at raise the question of the status of the border, at once literal and imaginary, that separates and binds together the world of the representation and that other world, itself not simply real, that lies "this" side of a given work's material surface. To acknowledge the quasi- fantasmatic status of that border is to concur in Derrida's insistence on the role of hypothesis or supposition in the act of seeing or intuiting, and in fact the reading of Fantin-Latour's drawings I shall put forward complements Derrida's-which focuses on the sitter's gaze as it hypothet- ically is given back to itself by the action of a mirror-by calling attention to another, equally important operation of that presumed mirror as well as to certain no less hypothetical actions of the sitter's hands. Another area of shared concern is suggested by the emphasis we each put on a metaphorics of blindness-but here I really am getting ahead of myself. (A terminological note: instead of Derrida's three-part distinction be- tween "object," "subject," and "signatory" [he also refers to the "object," "model," and "signatory"] of the drawings, I shall call the figure in the drawings the "sitter" and the drawings' maker the "artist-model." This in effect presumes that the drawings are self-portraits, a presumption that Derrida's nomenclature holds in suspense. But not only do I have no theoretical stake in maintaining that suspense, I am compelled to dissolve it in order to conduct the argument that follows.) In my books Absorption and Theatricality and Courbet's Realism I have tracked the evolution of an antitheatrical tradition within French painting other painters who also took part in one or more of the eight group exhibitions that were held between 1874 and 1886. The classic study of impressionism is John Rewald, The History of Impressionism (1946; New York, 1973). On the individual exhibitions, see Charles S. Mof- fett, The New Painting, Impressionism, 1874-1886 (exhibition catalog, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., 19 Jan.-6 Apr. 1986; The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, 19 Apr. 6-July 1986).</page><page sequence="6">6 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet from the middle of the eighteenth century until the advent of Manet in the first half of the 1860s.6 At the heart of that tradition was the require- ment, first articulated theoretically by Denis Diderot in the late 1750s and 1760s, that the figures in a painting (or tableau, a notion he extended to the stage) appear to take no more notice of the beholder than if the latter did not exist. What this meant in practice was that the represented fig- ures had to be made to appear entirely engrossed or, as I mainly say, absorbed in their actions, feelings, and states of mind; figures so absorbed were felt to be oblivious to everything but the objects of their attention, including, especially, the beholder standing before the canvas. Should the artist fail in that endeavor-should one or more figures in a picture seem merely to be striking an attitude or performing with a view to impressing an audience-the consequences were dire. Not only were the figures themselves seen as thIedtral, theatrical, a term of crushing abuse, the pic- ture as a whole was viewed in those terms and thus dismissed as a failure. In short the representation of absorption emerged as the privileged ve- hicle for seeking to establish the metaphysical illusion that the beholder did not exist, that there was no one standing before the canvas. It was that illusion above all that Diderot valued, that he found in the painting and drama he most admired, and that successive generations of French paint- ers tried, consciously or otherwise, to realize in their art. The main point to grasp about the Diderotian project is that in an obvious sense it was bound to fall short of its ultimate aim owing to the irreconcilable conflict between the demand that the beholder be denied and what I think of as the primordial convention-almost the transcen- dental condition-that all paintings are made to be beheld. Thus I have described a succession of major figures in the antitheatrical tradition- Greuze, David, G6ricault, Daumier, Millet-as having found themselves compelled to take ever more extreme measures in the attempt to neutral- ize or suspend that primordial convention, or to put this slightly differ- ently, in the attempt to secure the fiction of a radical separation between the world of the painting and that of the beholder. Examples of such measures include Greuze's exploitation of sentimental effects as a means of immuring his dramatis personae in his ambitious genre paintings of the 1760s and after; David's almost exactly opposite retreat from the dra- matic intensity of the Oath of the Horatii, Death of Socrates, and Lictors Re- turning to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (his masterpieces of the 1780s) to the suspension of action in favor of posing in the Intervention of the Sabine Women of 1796 and then his almost complete withdrawal from the repre- sentation of outward action and expression in the last of his ambitious history paintings, the Leonidas at Thermopylae (finished 1814); G6ricault's astonishing conceit in The Raft of the Medusa (1819) that if only the suffer- 6.

But the very extremity of those measures (not to mention their diversity, their inconsistency with one another) militated against their lasting success; however effective these or other paintings in the antitheatrical tradition may have been at a particular moment and in the eyes of a specific audi- ence, sooner or later, as tastes changed and the original impact of the paintings wore thin, they were bound to come into conflict with the fun- damental truth of their condition, at which point their attempts to deny or undo that truth lost all effectiveness and in certain cases (Greuze's sentimental genre paintings, David's Sabines, Millet's peasant pictures in the eyes of many critics) came to appear more or less blatantly theatrical in their own right. It's in this context that I understand the differently extreme strategy informing the Realist paintings of Gustave Courbet: a strategy not of absorptive closure, the walling out or curtaining off of the beholder standing before the picture, but something altogether different, the quasi-corporeal merger in the act of painting of the painter conceived now as the painting's first beholder (or painter-beholder) with the painting it- self. At least with respect to that beholder the painting would ideally es- cape beholding entirely; there would be no one before it looking on because the beholder who had been there was now incorporated or dis- seminated in the work. So for example in The Stonebreakers (1849; fig. 1) I see the young man depicted largely from the rear and bearing a basket of stones not simply as a figure for or as personifying the painter- beholder's left hand holding a palette but almost as continuous with that hand and the effort it put forth, just as I see the older man raising a hammer almost as continuous with the painter-beholder's right hand wielding the brush with which the picture was painted. (In Stephen Mel- ville's term, the boy and the man may be viewed as prolonging the actions of the painter-beholder's left and right hands within the picture.)7 Note in this connection how left and right inside The Stonebreakers are congru- ent with left and right "outside" it, that is, with the left/right orientation of the painter-beholder at work on the canvas; the difference between such congruence and the opposite relation of mirror-reversal will be cen- tral to my analysis of Fantin-Latour's drawings. Indeed, the fact that we see neither stonebreaker's face suggests a desire on the part of the 7. See Stephen Melville, "Compelling Acts, Haunting Convictions," review of Courbet's Realism, by Fried, Art History 14 (Mar. 1991): 117, where he urges, citing Philippe Lacoue- Labarthe, an understanding of mimesis as "prolongation."</page><page sequence="8">r ?':.?* Jr I ?

Similarly, in Courbet's magnificent Wheat Sifters (1854; fig. 2) the cen- tral kneeling figure depicted from the rear as she sifts wheat onto a can- vas ground cloth may be read as embodying the actions and orientation of the painter-beholder as he deposited bits of pigment onto the stretched canvas before him (in other words, not just the woman but the sifted wheat and the canvas ground cloth take part in a metaphorics or rather a metonymics of painting); the seated woman to the left dreamily separat- ing wheat from chaff by hand may be read as a version of the painter- beholder's left hand holding his palette; while the boy peering at close range into the black interior of the tarare, an early machine for sifting wheat, suggests the negation of beholding that would follow from the (physically impossible) incorporation and dissemination of the painter- beholder within his painting. One way of characterizing the different antitheatrical strategies pursued by Diderotian painting on the one hand and Courbet's Realist canvases on the other might be to say that whereas painters in the antitheatrical tradition before Courbet sought to make paintings that would in effect be blind to the presence before them of the beholder (which is why a certain thematics of blindness, keyed to classical</page><page sequence="10">10 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet prototypes such as Homer and Belisarius, was important to an artist like David), Courbet's Realist works evoke the blindness of the painter-beholder, or if this seems too strong, they evoke the eclipse of vision that physically merging with the painting before him would have entailed (which is why various figures in Courbet's paintings, including self-portraits like his Wounded Man, have their eyes closed). Both blindnesses thus belong to the enterprise of painting, which raises the question of their relation to the blindness of drawing on which Derrida insists. Perhaps the works we are about to consider will help clarify that point. The two self-portrait drawings I want to begin by examining were made around 1860, when Fantin-Latour was twenty-four. The first (fig. 3) was done in charcoal (with stump) and pencil, the second (fig. 4) in pen and black ink. Both are instances of the young Fantin's drawing style at its most authoritative, and both exemplify the hypothetical logic that Derrida analyzes in the passages quoted above. That is, both draw- ings convey the impression that the sitter is striving to portray his own image in a mirror, an assumption which, as Derrida shows, the drawings by themselves are powerless to confirm. Not that he contests that that is how the drawings were made; his point is that the dynamic of their mak- ing-assuming them to have been made in that way-is not manifest in the drawings themselves. I take his arguments in this regard to be irrefut- able, and I want to open my own analysis by focusing on certain features of both drawings that further exemplify the effects of a mirror whose presence in the drawings must nevertheless remain a matter of con- jecture. The effects I have in mind are ones of reversal of left and right, effects Derrida brackets when, seemingly not wishing to imply the presence of the mirror before developing its hypothetical status, he describes the right eye (in fig. 3) as "fixed firmly on its own image." Now, it has always been recognized that Fantin was right-handed.8 And yet figure 4 portrays the sitter drawing with his left hand, while in figure 3 we are shown his right hand grasping the tablet on which we presume he is drawing, for in fact we aren't shown his left hand or the act of drawing at all. This apparent reversal of left and right (from which we also deduce that it is the artist- 8. This is not to say that we have indisputable "external" evidence of his right- handedness, though it is conceivable that such evidence (for example, a photograph or even a portrait by another painter of Fantin in the act of painting) might turn up. It is to say that commentators on early Fantin self-portraits in which the sitter holds a brush in his left hand have never doubted that they were made with the help of a mirror. "Here, as in all his self-portraits, Fantin typically did not bother to invert the image he saw in the mirror, with the result that the paintbrush appears in the left hand," Michel Hoog writes of Fantin's Self-Portrait, Standing Holding a Paintbrush (1859) (Douglas Druick and Michel Hoog, Fantin- Latour [exhibition catalog, Grand Palais, Paris, 9 Nov. 1982-7 Feb. 1983; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 17 Mar.-22 May 1983; California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, 18 June-6 Sept. 1983], p. 77).

But the conjectural evidence could hardly be more powerful, and one detail in particular-the right-over-left (or "female") buttoning of the sitter's jacket as in fig. 4-may be taken as decisive.

For us today the mirror-reversed portrayal of the painter in the act of paint- ing has come to seem a characteristic feature of the self-portrait as a genre, but the surprising historical truth is that it became fairly common starting only around 1860, the moment we are considering; as Zirka Zar- emba Filipczak has observed, earlier self-portraits reveal "no such confla- tion of the viewer with the artist."' This is deeply interesting and 9. Zirka Zaremba Filipczak, PicturingArt in Antwerp, 1550-1700 (Princeton, N.J., 1987), p. 202. Actually there is at least one important full-blown exception-Annibale Carracci's Self-Portrait of 1585 in the Brera (in conversation with Filipczak it emerged that she was aware of this); Jacques-Louis David's Self-Portrait of 1794, made during his imprisonment following the fall of Robespierre, is also mirror-reversed (but we are not shown the canvas</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 13 doubtless explains why a similar instance of mirror-reversal in one of Fantin's early painted self-portraits appeared conspicuous enough to be remarked by a contemporary critic.'0 But what from my point of view is at least equally important is that Fantin's embrace of mirror-reversal introduced an aspect of irreality into works of seemingly uncompromis- ing realism. I mean that what we take to have been his fidelity to visual experience-to what he saw in a mirror before him-gave rise to works on which the sitter presumably is working as in the Annibale); and I have recently devel- oped an account of various paintings by Caravaggio that further qualifies her generaliza- tion: see Fried, "Some Thoughts on Caravaggio" (paper presented at a colloquium in memory of Louis Marin, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 12-13 Nov. 1993). It's also likely that other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century paintings will turn out to contain elements of mirror-reversal; for example, Salvator Rosa's Self-Portrait of around 1650 in the Detroit Institute of Arts depicts the sitter gesturing off-canvas with his left arm in a manner that suggests he may be painting. But Filipczak is right to say that mirror-reversal comes into its own starting in the 1860s. My thanks to Mark Antliff for bringing her observations to my attention. See also the brief discussions of the problem of mirror-reversal in John Pope-Hennessy, The Portrait in the Renaissance (New York, 1966), pp. 124-30 (on Diirer); Louis Marin, Ditruire lapeinture (Paris, 1977), pp. 154-60 (emphasizing the role of convex mirrors in preparation for a reading of Caravaggio's Medusa) and "Variations sur un portrait absent: Les Autopor- traits de Poussin, 1649-1650," Corps e'crit, no. 5 (1983): 87-107; Richard Brilliant, Portraiture (Cambridge, Mass., 1991), p. 146 (on mirror-reversal generally), pp. 157-58 (on Parmigia- nino's Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror), and pp. 159-61 (on Norman Rockwell's Triple Self- Portrait); and Joseph Leo Koerner, The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art (Chicago, 1993), pp. 3-5, 28 (again on Diirer). It might be noted that Umberto Eco insists that mirrors as such do not invert. "A mirror reflects the right side exactly where the right side is, and the same with the left side," Eco writes. It is the observer (so ingenuous even when he is a scientist) who by self-identification imagines he is the man inside the mirror and, looking at himself, realizes he is wearing his watch on his right wrist. But it would be so only if he, the observer I mean, were the one who is inside the mirror (Je est un autre!). On the contrary, those who avoid behaving as Alice, and getting into the mirror, do not so deceive themselves .... It is only when we anthropomorphize the virtual image that we are puzzled by right and left-that is, only at this point do we start wondering what right and left would be if the virtual image were the real object. [Umberto Eco, "Mirrors," Semiotics and the Philos- ophy of Language (Bloomington, Ind., 1984), pp. 205-6] We might say that what in this essay I call the mirror-reversed self-portrait performs that feat of anthropomorphization precisely by treating the virtual image as a real object (which is why I don't hesitate to speak of the image itself as "reversed," which technically it is not). I am grateful to David Wellbery for alerting me to Eco's text. 10. Louis Leroy, "Salon de 1861," Le Charivari, 7 June, 1861. A fictive exchange be- tween "Barbeau" and "Houspin" has the former say: "Wow! There is an artist with a really hairy face!" To which the other replies: "And he's a lefty." [Barbeau.--Matin! voila un artiste qui a une mine joliment herisbe (1060, de M. Fantin la Tour). Houspin.-Et puis il est gaucher.] The humor of the second quip depends on recognizing the sitter's left- handedness to be the product of mirror-reversal, which in turn supports the claim that commentators have never doubted that Fantin in fact was right-handed.</page><page sequence="14">14 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet that not only elide the presence of the mirror and allow at most partial access to the act of representation but also exactly reverse the facts of his appearance as seen by everyone but himself gazing into the mirror. Put more strongly, the realist self-portrait-rather, what I shall call the visual realist or ocular realist self-portrait-emerges as a contradiction in terms. For either it represents the image in the mirror, in which case it reverses the ordinary appearance of the artist-model, or it reverses that reversal in the interests of a broader (impersonal, disinterested) truth, in which case it is no longer faithful to what the artist-model sees. Within the framework of the ocular realist project there is no escaping that double- bind. (As Merleau-Ponty has observed, human beings have no direct, un- mediated perception of their own faces;" the ocular realist self-portrait makes that natural condition a problem for art.) But at the same time as the effects of reversal confirm the (still en- tirely hypothetical) presence of the mirror, another feature of Fantin's self-portrait drawings contests those effects by getting right and left back where they belong. I refer to the emphatically slanting hatching-a mode of shading, of signifying degrees of darkness-that intervenes dramati- cally in both drawings, as well as in a third drawing in pen and ink from roughly the same moment. For reasons that are probably both natural and conventional, right-handed artists in the Western tradition have tended to hatch from upper right to lower left while left-handed artists (notably Leonardo) have tended to hatch from upper left to lower right."2 The vigorous upper-right-to-lower-left hatching that threatens almost to collapse the different planes of Fantin's drawings into a single screen or grid of oblique marks may thus be read as evidence of the artist-model's actual bodily orientation relative to the sheet of paper, in contrast to the reversal of that orientation implied by the representational mirror image. Possibly other artists have made self-portrait drawings in which both com- ponents, mirror-reversal and hatching that matches their own bodily ori- entation, can be found. But I see these particular works as thematizing the tension between the two with exceptional force-as yoking together a singularly persuasive representational image with exceptionally assertive hatching-to the extent of virtually dividing the drawings from within. 11. See Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, trans. Colin Smith (Lon- don, 1962), p. 91. 12. The example of the right-handed Cezanne is especially interesting in this connec- tion. In his oil paintings, which from the 1880s on contain extensive areas of hatching, the hatching runs both from upper left to lower right and from upper right to lower left (though in general the first direction predominates). In view of Cezanne's attempt in his paintings to differentiate spatially and otherwise between the multiple contiguous planes indicated by individual units of hatching, this is hardly surprising. But in his drawings throughout his career CUzanne almost invariably hatched from upper right to lower left, as would be ex- pected.

(Greenwich, Conn., 1973), vol. 2.</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 15 And the question that then must be asked is, What does that internal division mean? What are the larger implications of the extreme contrast or tension between mirror-reversal and its opposite that our analysis has brought to light? Before answering that question, two points should be stressed. First, my discussion so far, like Derrida's in Memoirs of the Blind but on different grounds, seriously complicates the conventional view of what may be said to lie "this" side of the drawings' respective surfaces. Following one line of argument (taking the drawings as ocular realist images), what lies there-more precisely, what hangs or stands there, facing the sitter-is a mirror; following another line of argument (taking the drawings as indi- ces of their making), what is to be found there is the artist-model's right hand, wielding a pencil, pen, or piece of charcoal, and by extension (by continuity or metonymy) his entire body, and "beyond" his body a chair, a table, a room (in which of course there is also a mirror). In short, even leaving aside the role of the viewer-a crucial and disruptive one, as Der- rida has shown-there is no "this" side of Fantin's drawings in a simple, unproblematical sense. Rather, the drawings posit a network of hypothet- ical real-world relationships among at least three elements: the embodied artist-model in the act of making the drawing; the drawing itself on its block or support, held by the artist-model neither vertically nor horizon- tally but somewhere in between; and the mirror into which the artist- model gazes. Certainly nothing less than those elements can begin to account for the dynamic of the drawings' production insofar as the condi- tions of their production are taken to be represented in and by the draw- ings themselves. A second point to be stressed (it's already implicit in my description of the second of the three elements just mentioned) is that the enterprise of drawing depicted in these works is a two-handed operation. The draw- ings present themselves as the product not only of the actions of the artist-model's right hand wielding a pencil or pen but also, equally, of the actions of his left hand gripping the block. This feature of Fantin's self- portrait drawings is by no means typical of the genre and reveals an af- finity with oil painting, which in Fantin's time, as it had for centuries, involved the right (or dominant) hand wielding a brush and the left (or subordinate) hand holding a palette. In fact, I want to go further and suggest that what is at stake in the two-handedness of the act of drawing as pictured in Fantin's self-portraits is a relation not so much to painting generally as specifically to Courbet. In my earlier summary of Courbet's Realism I neglected to mention the extraordinary role played in his art by self-portraits. This is true both literally-self-portraits dominate his oeuvre throughout the 1840s-and figuratively-my reading of his art construes a number of his most ambi- tious canvases, including The Stonebreakers and The Wheat Sifters, as "real</page><page sequence="16">16 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet .?? i ?? c*..:?:. ?- ...,.

In Courbet's self-portraits proper, however, he was faced with another version of the double-bind, I touched on earlier: either be faithful to what he saw in the mirror, in which case the reversal of left and right would make him a stranger to his own image; or reverse that mirror-reversal, in which case he could identify bodily with the painted image as regards the depiction of right and left but at the cost of locating the depicted figure's right hand oppo- site his own left hand and vice-versa, thereby disrupting the congruence of left and right on which the possibility of quasi-corporeal merger equally depended. The solutions to this problem Courbet was led to de- vise were sometimes brilliant. In the early Self-Portrait with Black Dog (1844; fig. 5), for example, the sitter's bodily orientation allows his right 13. The term "all6gorie rbelle" is taken from the title of Courbet's painting, L'Atelier du peintre: Alligorie rdelle diterminant une phase de sept annees de ma vie artistique (1855).</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 17 hand to be portrayed in a way that subtly suggests an analogy not only with the orientation but also with the activity of the painter-beholder's right hand wielding a brush. (The landscape vista to the right can almost be seen as a painting on an easel in its own right.) Similarly, in the most important self-portrait of the 1840s, the much-darkened Man with the Leather Belt (1845-46?; fig. 6), the sitter's dramatically lit and sculptur- ally powerful right hand and wrist have been turned back into the picture-space, with the result that they are now wholly congruent with what we take to have been the orientation and in a sense the action of the painter-beholder's right hand and arm as they reached towards the canvas bearing a brush loaded with paint. In that painting, too, the other- wise inexplicable action of the sitter's left hand gripping his belt may be read as a figure for the action of the painter-beholder's left hand holding his palette, even though in this instance the two left hands are spatially misaligned. Finally, as an indication of how difficult the project of undo- ing mirror-reversal could be, I reproduce Courbet's The Cellist (1847; fig. 7), in which the obviously "incorrect" actions of the cellist's right and left hands-the first depressing the strings with excessive effort, the second unconvincingly plying the bow-seem to obey an implicit imperative- to "represent" the painter-beholder's hands in the act of painting the picture-that could not quite be reconciled with the latter's ostensible subject. '4 Viewed in this context, the upper-right-to-lower-left hatching in Fantin's self-portrait drawings of around 1860 expresses a similar im- pulse towards quasi-corporeal merger with the work in progress, or at least towards a relation of continuity or prolongation between artist- model and drawing. A previously unmentioned feature of figure 4 also bears on this issue: the depiction in its lower left-hand corner of a partial object, most likely the dishlike base of a small candlestick (the candle be- ing just beyond the edge of the representational field). I suggest that that partial object may also be seen as an image or imprint of the artist- model's left thumb, which, if we trust the drawing as a faithful record of mirror-reversal, would have gripped the sheet of paper precisely there. By the same token, though requiring a greater leap of the imagination, the largish indeterminate object that partly supports the drawing pad or block towards the lower right may be seen as a figure for the artist- 14. There is, however, one exception in Courbet's oeuvre to his otherwise consistent efforts to undo mirror-reversal. In the highly finished charcoal drawing in the Fogg Art Museum, Painter at His Easel (1847), Courbet has depicted himself painting with his left hand. (It's just possible that the implement the sitter is wielding is a pencil or charcoal- holder, but he is at work on a canvas and his action seems that of a painter rather than a draftsman.) The sitter holds no palette in his right hand, but what appears to be an outsized cuff of his coat surrounding that hand is palette-shaped; and what makes all this even more odd is that because it is a drawing, not a painting, Painter at His Easel can't be imagined to represent an actual reflection in a mirror (assuming, of course, that the sitter is painting, not drawing). See the brief discussion of this work in Fried, Courbet's Realism, p. 95.</page><page sequence="18">M-FY 410y FAA., oil M -Yi?:? WIPWR FIG. 6.-Gustave Courbet, Man with the Leather Belt, 1845-46?

(The relatively large size of that object as compared to the rest of the image would then be an expression of the particularly intense effort put forth by the artist-model's right hand.) In a third self-portrait drawing (fig. 8), also of these years, the sitter has turned towards his right (the artist- model having turned towards his left), and there is nothing that can plau- sibly be taken as a figure for the artist-model's hand or thumb (unless it is the formless darkness beneath the paper on its block); but the ink bottle near the bottom of the sheet has been depicted largely from above as if to make it available for use both by the sitter in the drawing and by the artist-model outside it. Note too the combination of upper-right-to-lower- left hatching with horizontal hatching across the table- or desktop on which the bottle rests; I take the horizontal hatching to define the bottom of the drawing as a transitional zone between the "world" of the image</page><page sequence="20">; ( /, ~ ~ i i,?b .' -"-,'-""7: ,- "i ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ,,. ,'""....--" ,-- .. .. -r-._, .

The use of the ink bottle as a switch point between opposed but intimately related "worlds" can plausibly be seen either as qualifying or as exacerbating our sense of the conflict between them. One other pencil-and-ink drawing of roughly this time (fig. 9), although not strictly a self-portrait, belongs with the three we have just examined. In it Fantin has depicted what seems to be a small room at the top of a house. The scene takes place at night; the room is dark except for a single source of light, a candle in a candleholder, which stands near the right-hand edge of a table or desk. The ceiling towards the left slopes inward, and on the far wall two darkish rectangles are juxtaposed with a lighter one that appears to lean against the wall rather than to be hanging on it. We cannot say with certainty what any of those rectangles represent (the larger rectangle towards the right bears an especially confusing rela- tion to the shadows around it), but it seems possible' that one of them, maybe the rectangle at the lower left, is a mirror (looked at closely it gives the impression of being framed, as does the larger rectangle on the wall). In addition something large, flat, and rectilinear, perhaps a blotter or a sheet of paper, can be made out lying on the table's surface. And there are a couple of chairs, one to the left of the table and the other in front of it. Although it can't be proved that this is the room in which Fantin made the self-portrait drawings we have been examining, the inference that it is seems nearly irresistible; in any case, we feel that it must have been a room just like this.'5 We might think of the drawing of the room as a "supplement" to the others, which is to say both as a further expres- sion of Fantin's sense of embodiedness and as an acknowledgment that the self-portrait drawings alone are powerless to convey the full bodily circumstances in which they were made.16 Seen in these terms, the dark- ness of the room-in both the drawing of the room and the self- portraits-belongs on the side of the body. It is as if the hyperbolic de- sire to evoke corporeal presence called for darkness as a means of min- imizing eyesight in favor of an emphasis on bodily experience. Here it should be recalled that the presumed dates of these drawings, circa 1860, places them if not literally on the border of impressionism at any rate within just a few years of the public debuts of the painters who will soon thereafter become the impressionists-Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, and oth- 15. Compare Fantin's letter to Whistler of 26 June 1859: "Oh nature, what a beautiful thing. I return from the Louvre, I dine, and between 5 and 8 in the evening I place myself before my mirror and t0te a te^te with nature we tell each other things that are a thousand times more valuable than everything the most charming woman could say" (Fantin-Whistler correspondence, Glasgow University Library). ["Oh la nature quelle belle chose. Je rentre du Louvre etje dine et de 5h ' 8h du soirje me mets devant ma glace et en tete a tete avec la nature nous nous disons des choses qui valent mille fois tout ce que la plus charmante femme peut dire."] 16. On Derrida's notion of the "supplement," see, for example, Derrida, Of Grammatol- ogy, trans. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore, 1976), pp. 141-64.</page><page sequence="22">22 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet ers-and that impressionism as an artistic movement has always been understood as valorizing, even heroizing eyesight, visual perception, as such. (The critic Marc de Montifaud in 1874 called it "the school of the eyes.")17 And yet Fantin's drawings, for all their commitment to what I have called perceptual or ocular realism, seem also to be in the grasp of an altogether different representational regime. How are we to under- stand this? That question brings us to the central claim of this essay. Simply put, Fantin's self-portrait drawings conjoin two fundamentally different, even fundamentally opposed, modes of realism: first, a realism of the body, ex- pressed by a variety of means and derived ultimately from (or at least consistent with the practice of) Fantin's chief immediate realist predeces- sor, Courbet; and second, a realism of eyesight, of visual perception-an ocular realism-based on an ideal of exact fidelity to appearances and issuing in masterly transcriptions of the artist-model's reversed image in a mir- ror. What must be stressed-what makes these drawings remarkable-is not only the coexistence in them of the two modes of realism but also the extent to which those modes define themselves against one another and so remain distinct, separate, juxtaposed rather than intermixed. Or to interpret that mutual opposition diachronically by placing it in a strongly vectored historical narrative, what Fantin's drawings demonstrate is the emergence of an ocular, perceptual realism from a corporeal one. Framed in that way, the intensity of the sitter's gaze-as of "a fascinated hunter," in Derrida's phrase-suggests not only the artist-model's will to record as veristically as possible the surface facts of his appearance but also, so to speak, the gaze's own will to come clear of the body-of the depths of the body, of the body's darkness and blindness-by fastening onto the image in the mirror. For it is precisely the logic of mirror-reversal that enables the act of seeing (and of drawing exactly what one sees) to declare itself as such against the background, the persistence, of a bodily mode of realism that, as in the paintings by Courbet we have looked at, rejected left/right reversal in the interests of left/right congruence and for which, as in Courbet's art generally, the faculty of vision was in the end second- ary. In fact I want to claim that a "crossing of borders" between bodily and ocular realism-ultimately, between Courbet's Realism and the realism of the impressionists-was a crucial aspect of the historical task of Fantin's generation. The unique significance of Fantin's self-portrait drawings is that, more perspicuously than any other works of their moment, they allow us to intuit-to hypothesize-if not the invisible border itself, at any rate the act of passage from one side of it to the other.'8 17.

Compare Carol Armstrong's reading of Edgar Degas's Self-Portrait (1857-58) in the Sterling and Francine Clark collection in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in strongly "ocular" (as opposed to "corporeal") terms. For Armstrong, "it is ... as if the site of the painter's</page><page sequence="23">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 23 The ramifications of all this are far-reaching. For example: 1) My reading of Fantin's self-portrait drawings might be extended to apply to several of his early self-portrait paintings.19 But I will settle here for glancing at just one canvas, the famous Homage to Delacroix (1864; fig. 10), a group portrait of painters and critics (including Fantin himself, Manet, Whistler, Legros, Baudelaire, and Champfleury) that is nothing less than an artistic manifesto on behalf of the generation of 1863.20 What's noteworthy about the Homage in the present context is that Fan- tin-wearing a white shirt and seated in the foreground to the left of the portrait of Delacroix-has placed a palette, not a brush, in his own right hand, thereby declaring his commitment to painting only what he himself could see even at the price of falsifying what I have called the impersonal or disinterested truth of appearances. Moreover, that falsification is un- derscored by the implied contrast between the figure of Fantin and those of his companions. The other sitters he had observed directly; hence none is mirror-reversed, as is shown by the left-over-right (or "male") buttoning of theirjackets. But his own image he had been able to see only with the aid of a mirror, and by insisting on that in a group portrait that obviously did not present itself as the record of a mirror image of the group as a whole, he evidently wanted to give the fact of reversal a pro- grammatic significance it couldn't quite assume in self-portraits of himself alone. A further implication is that Fantin by 1864 had come to recognize the significance of mirror-reversal for his art, perhaps because in prepa- ration for the Homage he had studied his previous self-portraits and been struck by their unanimity in that regard. 2) The findings of this essay bear closely on the work of Whistler. An impressive painting by Whistler, La Dame blanche (1862), was the one indubitable success of the Salon des Refuses. But Whistler at the outset of his career was also active as an etcher, and I want to propose that various basic differences between the first two published sets of his etch- ings-the "French Set" of 1857-58 and the "Thames Set" of 1859-61- exemplify the distinction between a realism of the body and a realism of visual perception.21 So for example The Rag Gatherers (1858; fig. 11), from craft [in that painting] is in the eye and not in the hand, as if his painter's clothes are now the sign of his job of looking, rather than his manual, material activity" (Carol Armstrong, Odd Man Out: Readings of the Work and Reputation of Edgar Degas [Chicago, 1991], p. 233). In this respect as in others, Degas is not the altogether exceptional figure Armstrong takes him to be. 19. In particular, the mirror-reversed Self-Portrait, Standing Holding a Paintbrush (1859) in Grenoble; I analyze that work in Manet's Modernism. 20.

Much the same might be said about a more important etching, La Vieille aux loques (1858; fig. 12), which also includes conspicuous traces of Whistler's fingerprints and palm prints, the result of a technical acci- dent-"foul biting"-that occurs with suspicious frequency in the "French Set." (Foul biting occurs when the coated metal plate has been manipulated too much by the artist; when it is then placed in the acid bath, the acid eats through the coating where the latter has been worn away by fingerprints, palm prints, and so on.) The usual explanation is that because similar prints are sometimes found in etchings by Rem- brandt, whom Whistler greatly admired, he was willing to allow them to remain in certain of his own early images.23 But in the light of the present argument (think of the "thumbprint" in the lower left-hand corner of fig. 4), those fingerprints and palm prints seem further evidence of some- thing like bodily continuity or prolongation between etching and etcher-as if The Old Rag Woman were a body part in its own right.24 Something altogether different is at stake in the etchings of the "Thames Set." Take for example two of the finest, Eagle Wharf (1859; fig. 13) and Black Lion Wharf (1859; fig. 14). Both insist on the clear separa- tion of spatial planes, on a sharpness and minuteness of detail in the middle and far distance that suggests the view through a telescope or pair of binoculars, and above all on the unflagging precision of a line or trait whose firmly volitional character is at the farthest pole from the automatistic, in that sense somatic, line of the "French Set."''25 Moreover, the diffuse, evenly distributed light draws attention to the blankness and 22. On anthropomorphism in Courbet's art, see Fried, Courbet's Realism, pp. 238-54. 23. See Lochnan, The Etchings ofJames McNeill Whistler, pp. 52-53. 24. Interestingly, it was in 1860 that a British colonial administrator, Sir William Her- schel, first thought of adapting the Bengalese practice of imprinting letters and documents with a fingertip dipped in ink or tar for the purpose of identifying individuals. See Carlo Ginzburg, "Morelli, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes: Clues and Scientific Method," trans. Anna Davin, History Workshop 9 (Spring 1980): 26-27. Herschel published an article ex- plaining his method in 1880, and Francis Galton's Finger Prints, which acknowledged Her- schel but went far beyond him, appeared in 1892 (ibid.). 25. The question of the relationship between will and automatism is basic to my reading of Courbet (and also of photography) in Courbet's Realism. Also, the association between ocular realism and the will that the present analysis implies could lead us to consider an- other important French text on drawing, Paul Valery's Degas danse dessin (Paris, 1938); see in particular the section entitled "Voir et tracer," pp. 54-57.</page><page sequence="26">177.

All these points are driven home by the legibility of the relatively minute signs and lettering that decorate housefronts in the "Thames Set," a feature as characteristic of it as Whistler's fingerprints and palm prints are of the "French Set." The small scale of the lettering enforces a sense of what might be called ocular distance, while the inherent direc- tionality of the lettering suppresses the thought of the reversed image that the artist actually incised on the plate and so reinforces the emphasis on the sheet of paper. (This is to say that because the medium of etching comprises a stage-the printing of the image-that necessarily involves left-right reversal, ocular realism in Whistler's "Thames Set" etchings is associated with an opposite relation to reversal from ocular realism in Fantin's self-portrait drawings. What is fascinating, though, is that the issue of reversal versus nonreversal is operative in both.) Finally, it's worth noting that figures in the foreground of the "Thames Set" etchings tend to appear aware of the artist-viewer; this too is a distancing device, in contrast to the somnambulistic absorption of the figure in La Vieille aux loques. (Even when, as in Black Lion Wharf the foreground figure seems momentarily lost in thought, there is something in his expression, a hint of nervous intensity waiting to explode, that puts the viewer on guard.)26 Students of Whistler have of course recognized the stylistic disparity be- tween the "French" and the "Thames" sets. But they have missed its sig- nificance, which can't be understood in merely stylistic terms.27 One more early work by Whistler is relevant to these concerns. In Becquet the Fiddler, a drypoint of 1859-60 (fig. 15), Whistler has portrayed a French musician friend playing a sort of cello-and has almost com- pletely omitted the cellist's hands as well as his instrument. In my brief discussion of Courbet's self-portrait as The Cellist of a dozen years before, I noted the difficulty he had in correlating the player's right and left 26. In fact no less than six of the twelve prints in the "French Set" also depict figures looking more or less directly at the viewer; what sets the "Thames Set" figures apart is the contrast between their nearness to the viewer and the evocation of distance elsewhere in the image. Other "French Set" prints such as The Kitchen (the most powerful evocation of an absorptive-somatic space in the whole series) and The Title to the "French Set" (in which Whistler sits drawing while surrounded by a crowd of children) also bear on my argument. 27. Lochnan suggests that the "Thames Set" etchings represent an attempt by Whistler to find an equivalent for the eye's inability to focus with equal sharpness and at the same time on objects at different distances (The Etchings ofJames McNeill Whistler, pp. 95-100). She writes: "If one looks closely at Black Lion Wharf Eagle Wharf The Pool and Longshoremen, it is immediately apparent that while some areas are 'in focus,' others are 'out of focus,' and that some fall beyond the range of peripheral vision" (p. 95). I disagree: the cardinal feature of the first three etchings, it seems to me, is the extremely sharp focus of all the spatial zones, which is to say that the etchings seek to evoke an impossibly clear, precise, and spatially comprehensive act of seeing. (Longshoremen scarcely seems pertinent to this discussion.)</page><page sequence="30">30 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet ., ' ? , . , i ' '" ? .. . . ' ?;.

Something not dissimilar takes place here. It's as though Whistler sought to identify his own action of marking the metal plate with the represented action of playing the cello, but he found himself prevented from doing so-blocked from taking up the corporeal realist mode such an identifi- cation would have entailed-either because the image as a whole belonged to an ocular, not corporeal, register or because the sheer differ- ence (for example, of scale) between playing a cello and incising a plate was too stark for such an act of identification to succeed. At any rate, the violent scoring of the plate to the left and right of the seated musician suggests a displacement of representational energies and perhaps also feelings of frustration at an experience of blockage the artist cannot fully have understood. Significantly, however, Whistler not only didn't discard Becquet the Fiddler, he included it in the "Thames Set," perhaps recogniz-</page><page sequence="31">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 31 ' ' .  ' f. W .!

In Le Souper (fig. 16), a small etching made between 1858 and 1860, Legros has depicted four figures in a modest interior dining around a small round table illuminated by a candle. Two of the seated figures are men; each is absorbed in eating, the one at the left cutting something on his plate and the one at the right either lifting a bowl to his lips or setting it down. The seated figure in the left foreground may well be a woman; we see her mainly from the rear and no more than glimpse her profil perdu. Beyond the man at the right and looking directly at the viewer, a 28. In Manet's Modernism I go on to consider a slightly later painting by Whistler, the mirror-reversed Artist in His Studio (1865-66) in the Art Institute of Chicago. And there is a mirror-reversed self-portrait drawing by Whistler, Portrait of the Artist (ca. 1860s), in the Freer Gallery of Art that seems particularly close to Fantin's drawings of around 1860. See David Park Curry, James McNeill Whistler at the Freer Gallery of Art (exhibition catalog, Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., 11 May-5 Nov. 1984), p. 237, pl. 204. Together with Fantin's self-portrait drawings and paintings and Manet's Self-Portrait with Palette (1878-79), to be discussed below, these suggest that mirror-reversal of the image of the artist in the act of drawing or painting was a generational trope. See also the reference below to Frederic Bazille's Self-Portrait with Palette in note 29.</page><page sequence="32">32 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet standing woman seems to pause in the act of placing a small dish on the table (though here too it's possible that she's removing it). But a fifth personage is indicated as well: I mean whoever is meant to sit at the place that has been laid in the center foreground, a place whose orientation- into the space of the image-matches that of the artist (and viewer). In fact the implication is strong that the place in the foreground has been set for the artist, for Legros, who thereby posits himself in a Courbet-like relation to the etching as a whole, entering and in effect completing it. (Somewhere in the background to Le Souper is Courbet's After Dinner at Ornans of 1849. And out there in the not too distant future is Monet's enigmatic Le Dejeuner of 1868.) At the same time, the outward gaze of the standing woman posits a more distanced-in the language of this essay, a more visual or ocular-relation to the artist and viewer, while the quiet absorption of the other figures in their meal suggests the obliviousness to being beheld that I have associated with the Diderotian tradition in its classic form. In other words, Legros's little etching provides a kind of summa of relational possibilities with respect to the beholder, though once again the historical analogues of those possibilities matter less than the coexistence of the latter in a single work. Finally, Le Souper implicitly figures the enterprise of etching in terms of the activity of eating: as if the modest scale of etching in general and this etching in particular thematizes the virtual continuity between artist and work that corporeal realism evokes as physically incorporating or ingest- ing the work of art. (It may not be irrelevant that the production of an etching also comprises a stage when the line is eaten-"bitten"-by acid.) But this in turn implies a considerable restriction of ambition in compari- son with Courbet's monumental Realist canvases of the late 1840s and 1850s, in which the (literally unrealizable) project of incorporation- painter into painting-is vectored the other way. A comparable restric- tion of ambition marks Fantin's self-portrait drawings and Whistler's "French Set" etchings, and it may be that that narrowing down-that self-limitation of corporeal realism to the confines of the artist's body- presaged the emergence of an ocular realism that in the next generation would flower in impressionism. 4) Although I have come close to saying that the advent of impres- sionism in the 1870s marked the full emergence of ocular as opposed to corporeal realism, I want also to stress that a certain relation to the body persisted within and beyond impressionism, which is to say that the oppo- sition between the two modes of realism was not, and could not have been, absolute. (Vision is a bodily faculty, as Merleau-Ponty never ceases to remind us.) Among the impressionists proper the implied presence of the body is most evident in the work of Camille Pissarro, who in canvases like the Sente de Justice, Pontoise (1872; fig. 17) apprehended his chosen motif as if from the rear. That is, I see Pissarro as often having sought out "views" of the world (the French term is aspects) that allowed him</page><page sequence="33">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1994 33 ,.U ?". .,! . .

Another painter in the impressionist orbit whose work has been seen in terms of the implied presence of the body is Paul Cezanne; see Merleau-Ponty's classic (if problem- atic) essay, "Cezanne's Doubt," Sense and Non-Sense, trans. Hubert L. Dreyfus and Patricia Allen Dreyfus (Evanston, Ill., 1964), pp. 9-25; more recently Norman Bryson, "Intertextu- ality and Visual Poetics," Critical Texts 4, no. 2 (1987): 1-6 (equally problematic, though on other grounds); and Stephen Bann, The True Vine: On Visual Representation and the Western Tradition (Cambridge, 1989), pp. 90-91. More broadly, Jonathan Crary, in his Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century (Cambridge, Mass., 1990), has argued that starting in the early nineteenth century an epistemic shift came increasingly to locate vision "within the unstable physiology and temporality of the human body" (p. 70); impressionist painting in my account not only does not stand apart from that development, its commitment, at least at the outset, to what I have been calling an ocular realism marks a particular stage in painting's investigation of the nature of human vision, an investigation that perhaps reaches its apogee of refinement in the modern French tradition in Georges Seurat's neoimpressionist canvases. See Crary, "Seurat's Modernity," in Seurat at Gravelines: The Last Landscapes, ed. Ellen Wardwell Lee (exhibition catalog, Indianapolis Museum of Art, 14 Oct.-25 Nov. 1990), pp. 61-65. Compare also Crary's recent article, "Unbinding Vision," Octobei; no. 68 (Spring 1994): 21-44, in which Manet's late In the Conservatory (1879) is read in relation to the contemporaneous psycho-physiological problematic of "attention." Still another painter associated with the impressionist generation, Frederic Bazille (killed in the Franco-Prussian War before the emergence of impressionism proper), painted a mirror-reversed Self-Portrait with Palette (1869-70?) that belongs with the works we have been examining. It too is analyzed in Manet's Modernism.</page><page sequence="34">34 Michael Fried Between Realisms: From Derrida to Manet 5) All this is to have said nothing about Manet, who from the start maintained a greater distance from Courbet's example than Fantin and Legros and perhaps Whistler as well. But the "crossing of borders" from a corporeal to an ocular realism that has been brought to light constitutes a new framework within which the historical significance of Manet's art will need to be rethought. One work by him that invites being seen in those terms is his Self-Portrait with Palette (1878-79; fig. 18), which al- though outside the time frame of the rest of this essay is too important to ignore. In it, the right-handed painter has represented himself with right and left hands reversed, no doubt because he relied on an image of him- self in a mirror. But the overall effect of Manet's canvas differs sharply from that of Fantin's self-portrait drawings. Instead of the opposition noted in the drawings between the exact portrayal of what the artist- model saw in a mirror (in which the hand is completely subordinated to the eye) and the act of upper-right-to-lower-left hatching (in which the orientation and in a sense the reality of the artist-model's body are brought into play), in Manet's self-portrait a primary commitment to a certain speed both of seeing and of execution places eye and body, or rather eye and hand, in exactly the same situation or at least under exactly equivalent pressure. ("Hand" rather than "body" in that the Self-Portrait with Palette foregrounds manual dexterity as such rather than mobilizing the work of the hand or hands in the interests of embodiedness; compare St6phane Mallarm6's prose portrait of the artist, which recalls him saying, "'The eye, a hand. .. .9')30 More precisely, the implied fiction of the Self- Portrait with Palette is that Manet no sooner glimpsed his reversed image in a mirror than he rendered it in paint by the virtuoso action of his hand and brush or, to put this slightly differently, that undoing the effects of mirror-reversal would have required more time than was available to him; the extremely summary nature of the painted Manet's left (the actual Manet's right) hand holding a brush endorses such a fiction by intimating that being in rapid ceaseless motion-being everywhere at once-the hand could not be captured in paint and fixed in place."3 This may seem to imply the subordination of the hand to the eye or, say, to an attempt to render the instantaneousness of seeing at its most unimpeded. But Manet's profound involvement with instantaneousness (also with strikingness) as a marker of the primordial encounter, the inescapable 30.

The sense of an unbreakable link between the fact of mirror-reversal and a commit- ment to speed of seeing and of execution is only sharpened by an awareness of the Self- Portrait with Palette's historical prototype, Velaizquez's unreversed self-portrait in Las Meninas, the commitment to speed apparently taking precedence even over a conceptually prior reference to the earlier work. On the larger question of the meaning of Manet's allusions to the art of the past, see Fried, "Manet's Sources," "Painting Memories," and Manet's Mod- ernism.</page><page sequence="35">... .: :  .;I(R !"  "i ;it: :i, , "" ! .,.;~~ ~~~i~i:i~i : i'ii ? : :::::]ii .. ....~ ~ ~ ~: ..

See Fried, "Manet in His Generation" and Manet's Modernism for more on fac- ingness, instantaneousness, and strikingness in Manet's painting and that of other members of the generation of 1863 as well as in the art criticism of the 1860s. A major theme of Manet's Modernism is the need to break the hold of the still largely dominant "impressionist" account of Manet's art in terms of the primacy of vision, an account which, as early as the 1870s and 1880s, made his art critically intelligible at the cost of radically simplifying it.</page></plain_text>
