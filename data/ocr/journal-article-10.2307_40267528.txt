According to a judicious contemporary, Henry Crabb Robinson, Coleridge's philosophi- cal teachings were not insincere, as his opponents sometimes alleged, but inconsistent. Ever since, Coleridge's apparent inconsistencies have proved a fertile field for research, whether in the form of arguments that he did develop an underlying system that need only be correctly reconstructed, or that he was genuinely muddled. A decade ago, Seamus Perry's Coleridge and the Uses of Division took the latter line, but with the favourable twist that Coleridge's was an 'enabling' inconsistency, a double-mindedness that coaxed his sympathies in fruitfully different directions. Ben Brice's approach has a certain affinity with Perry's, but a modified enthusiasm: he discovers in Coleridge's 'pained acknowledge- ment of uncertainty and doubt' only an 'authentic' response to a philosophical and religious dilemma, not a particularly original one (p. 9). The dilemma regards the relationship between God and world, infinite and finite. Coleridge sought a sacramental account of symbolism, whereby the divine Logos is 'both immanent within and transcendent of the language of nature' (pp. 1-2). As Brice suggests, however, Coleridge's private notes often betray uncertainty about the possibility of reading the divine handwriting in nature; nor do his published arguments always live up to their claims. The first half of Coleridge and Scepticism usefully situates these doubts in relation to two related intellectual traditions whose significance for the Romantics has previously been neglected: 'epistemological piety' and 'theological voluntarism'. Epistemological piety derives from Calvin's insistence on the inability of fallen man to discern the divine signa- ture in the world that the prelapsarian, Adamic intellect would have clearly perceived. Theological voluntarism, as maintained by the natural scientists Boyle and Newton,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 159 holds that God's will is omnipotent: the implication being that all axioms of logic and science are contingent and liable to be overturned. That Boyle can still express confidence in his research reflects, according to Brice, his conviction that he is among the Elect and thus exercises 'regenerate' reason - a conviction the laudanum- addicted Coleridge was conscious of being unable to replicate. Brice's emphasis on Calvinist preoccupations in Coleridge's thought is anecdotally confirmed by the fact that when in an 1815 letter to R. H. Brabant Coleridge declared his 'Last Farewell' to ''Modern Calvinism' Modern was clearly the operative word. Brice argues that Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding assimilated both afore- mentioned traditions. For Locke, that is, although God does leave signs of himself in the creation that the regenerate may read, the creation bears no necessary relation to Him. Human understanding being thus confined within 'narrow bounds', philosophy must maintain due modesty (p. 50). Newton, too, believed that natural philosophy must gener- ally settle for probabilities rather than absolutes, but despite this premise claimed rather too much certainty in his design argument for the existence of God (p. 62). Brice describes how Hume then exploited the Calvinistic piety of Locke, Boyle, and Newton for an anti- religious purpose. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume exposes the fallacy of the Newtonian analogy: whereas the presence of a house enables us to infer a builder because we have experience of previous cases of this kind, we have never witnessed the building of worlds, and so may not make any inferences from this unique case (p. 71). In Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion Hume makes the sceptic Philo expatiate on this point, mock-piously decrying the anthropomorphic tendency of human reason in order to posit an utterly transcendent, inscrutable God. Being unknowable, however, such a deity cannot be an object of worship or relationship - and thus Hume 'forks' anthropomorphism on the one hand and deism on the other. Coleridge, of course, expressed contempt for the infidel Hume. Yet Brice makes the ingenious suggestion that 'Kantian aesthetics acted as a kind of "Trojan Horse" through which Coleridge was forced to confront Humean scepticism' (p. 83). Brice sketches Kant's pietistic background (weaving in Coleridge's recognition of the Sage of Konigsberg's essen- tial modesty), to account for the 'anti-symbolic' nature of his account of the sublime in the Critique of the Power of Judgment (p. 86). With this term Brice refers to Kant's insistence that natural objects cannot symbolise Ideas of Reason: the experience of the sublime consists precisely in the imagination's failure to achieve such symbolism, thus enabling us to recog- nise the (moral, non- sensuous) grandeur of our own Reason. Hence Kant strongly approves the biblical prohibition against idolatrous images (pp. 87, 92), just as Locke did before him (p. 48). As Brice sums up, 'Kant confronts the Humean "fork" of anthropomorphism and agnosticism, and chooses the latter' (p. 87): a disturbing choice from Coleridge's perspec- tive, and one barely softened by Kant's account of 'symbolic hypotyposis', which admits that natural beauty can form a limited kind of bridge to the supersensible. Brice's point is that according to Kant, hypotyposis involves the mind creating symbols, not discovering them in nature (p. 93). This interpretation of Kant is ably defended; but it is open to the objection that this was not how Coleridge himself read Kant. When Coleridge claims to have 'mastered the spirit' of the Critique of the Power of Judgment (p. 82), he alludes to the distinction between the letter and spirit of Kant that had become standard in 1790s Germany. Coleridge referred likewise in chapter nine of the Biographia Literaria to Kant's 'hints and insinua- tions', refusing to take Kantian modesty at face value after all. And this was not groundless,</page><page sequence="3">160 REVIEWS for Kant does indeed hint at a potentially idealistic escape from the prongs of Hume's fork: in the Prologomena to Every Future System of Metaphysics, he explicitly espouses a 'symbolic anthropomorphism' (ยง57-58), which as commentators sometimes note, preserves some of the sense of divine mystery propagated by older, metaphysical analogy-theories. It was primarily Schelling who capitalised on Kant's equivocations to develop a monistic theory of symbolism which, though attractive to the ex-Unitarian Coleridge, did finally seem to the English writer dangerously pantheistic; pantheism being a controversial term that Brice tends to avoid, but whose relation to 'anthropomorphism' could do with untan- gling. Brice himself briefly offers an important insight in this direction when he notes that at least around 1815, 'Coleridge's admixture of faith and doubt in symbolic apprehension is a reflection of his irreconcilable loyalty to both Kant and Schelling at this point in his career' (p. 154): a fact that calls for elaboration in future research. The second half of Coleridge and Scepticism applies the foregoing theory in readings from two phases of Coleridge's career, 1795-1805 and 1815-1825. Brice moves deftly between notebook entries, poetry, and published prose, allowing Coleridge to speak fully for him- self, before closing in to expose the doubts and contradictions he sees in most of these texts. For Brice, the early poem Religious Musings, with its confident assertion of the unclouded vision of the elect and the impending Second Coming, gave way, in the wake of the disasters in revolutionary France and Coleridge's personal distress, to an anxiety that far from reading symbolic meanings in the forms of nature and history, he may simply have been projecting them from his all too fallen self. This seems a little strained in respect to 'Frost at Midnight': to say that the 'dim sympathies' Coleridge sees between himself and the film on the grate represent 'simply an act of narcissistic projection that he instantly recognizes and condemns' (p. 141) overlooks the poem's meditative tone. On the other hand, Brice's interpretation illuminates 'Dejection: An Ode' well, and opens an avenue into much of Coleridge's later work. In an analysis of Coleridge's sympathetic explanation of the vision suffered by Luther, when the latter supposedly hurled an inkpot at the devil he saw appearing in his room, Brice teases out the uncomfortable closeness of symbolic perception to delusion. Coleridge's fear of delusion emerges again through a detailed reading of Lay Sermons. Here, notes Brice, Coleridge ventures to interpret the book of the world with much less confidence than he displays in interpreting the Bible, and so betrays his uneasiness about the argument from design that he is trying to sustain. This line of thought could have been pursued into Coleridge's eventual demolition of the design argument in the Opus Maximum. Brice, however, steers equally appropriately into Aids to Reflection, a work that insists powerfully on the fallen status of human nature. For Brice, the mature Coleridge's knotty meditation on the way analogical language may convey spiritual truths ultimately gives rise to a deflationary conclusion: a symbolic expression 'is no more or less than a metaphor one has faith in' (p. 200). All his attempts to read a divine script in nature, then, collapse into a slightly desperate appeal to 'faith and revelation' in the face of Hume's sceptical fork. Though tenable from a modern perspective, Brice's reading falters on the claim that Coleridge's recommendation of faith 'robbed him of his ability to communicate with his audience and age' (p. 190). On the contrary, the immense popularity of Aids of Reflection in the nineteenth century owed much to its reputation as a convincing rebuttal of scepticism. The lucidity and rigour of Coleridge and Scepticism should recommend it not just to Coleridgeans, but to any reader interested in interactions between literature and</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 161 philosophy in the long eighteenth century. The work exhibits, however, the very modesty that it traces in the philosophers under discussion, leaving many suggestive points of departure behind - above all the complex question of Coleridge's interpretation of Kantian aesthetics. james vigus University of Jena doi:10.1093/res/hgnll8 Advance Access published on 8 August 2008</page></plain_text>
