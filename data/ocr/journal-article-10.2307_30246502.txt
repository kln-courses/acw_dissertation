<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II MONA C. CHARLES SALLY J. COLE ABSTRACT Chronometric dates, architecture, durable material culture, and rock art are exam- ined to assess variation in Basketmaker II between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 500. Data from alcove and open sites in eight eastern and western regions of the Colorado Plateau are compared. The overall similarities indicate that Basket- maker II is a shared system in which local and regional populations participated momentarily and over time. The system was in place by 400 B.C. and had so- lidified by 200 B.C. The architecture, artifacts, and rock art point to the presence and exchange of specific ideas, and practices. The Basketmaker II system probably emerged from existing Archaic patterns and became more homogeneous as a suc- cessful and sustainable identity developed. RESUMEN Se examinan las fechas cronome'tricas, la arquitectura, la cultura material durable, y el arte en roca para determinar la variaci6n en Basketmaker II entre aproximadamente 1000 A.C. y 500 D.C. Se comparan datos de grutas y de sitios abiertos en ocho regiones del este y del oeste de la meseta de Colorado. Las semejanzas generales indican que Basketmaker II es un sistema compartido en el cual las poblaciones locales y regionales participaron tanto momentdneamente como por un tiempo mds largo. El sistema habia empezado por 400 A.C. y se habia solidificado por 200 A.C. La arquitectura, los artefac- tos, y el arte en roca sefialan la presencia y el intercambio de ideas, y prdcticas especificos. El sistema de Basketmaker II probablemente sali6 de patrones arcaicos existentes y lleg6 a ser mds homogineo mientras una identidad exitosa y sostenible se desarrollaba. B II represents the beginnings and much of the temporal de- velopment associated with the Anasazi archaeological tradition. The technical and ideological contributions of this stage have long been recognized in the material culture and rock art records, and the nature of Basketmaker II KIVA: The Journal of Southwestern Archaeology and History, Vol. 72, No. 2 (Winter 2006), pp. 167-216.

This study diverges from ear- lier investigations by reviewing a wide range of data with limited exposure in the literature, by expanding the geographic focus, and by compiling a database (Charles and Cole 2005). Chronometric data, architecture, durable material culture, and rock art from groups of sites in eight physiographic regions of the Colorado Plateau are examined to assess Basketmaker II variation and to explore the reasons behind it (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1). The site groups are located inside and outside the greater San Juan culture area where "Basket Makers" were first described and are most often studied (Atkins 1993; Berry 1982; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Matson 1991; Morris and Burgh 1954; Smiley and Robins 1997; Wetherill 1896-1897).

Architecture, artifact, and site attributes for Basketmaker II sites used in this study. the site groups are: Durango, Navajo Reservoir, La Sal Mountains, Chuska and Lukachukai Mountains (Chuska-Lukachukai), Black Mesa, Cedar Mesa, Glen Canyon, and Kanab. Morris and Burgh compare Basketmaker II sites near Durango, Colorado, to sites in Arizona and New Mexico to identify similarities and differences in archi- tecture, projectile points, ground stone, and textiles. They conclude that, despite the differences, "the San Pedro stage of the Cochise Culture may have been pa- rental to both" (1954:85). Berry (1982) and Berry and Berry (1986) solidify these observations by suggesting that groups of immigrants from the Southern Basin and Range colonized the Colorado Plateau in three, discreet occupational waves. Matson (1991) proposes that diversity in Basketmaker II results from at least two archaeological populations typified by sites on Black Mesa and Cedar Mesa in the western San Juan River drainage and, in the east, near Durango and in the Navajo Reservoir District. He argues that the two groups manifest ethnic differences. The western populations are viewed as immigrants with origins in San Pedro Cochise Culture, and those in the east are seen as descendents of Great Basin-Colorado Plateau Archaic populations. Smiley (1997, 2002) reevaluates Basketmaker II chronology and concludes that a millennium or more must now be factored into the cultural process. Robins (1997) and Robins and Hays-Gilpin (2000), in turn, outline a chrono- logical sequence between approximately 1500 B.C. and A.D. 400 for Basketmaker</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1.

Robins proposes that regional differences reflect the levels of social interaction. In a 1999 review of Basketmaker II, Lipe sees a need for new research crite- ria in light of the lengthy time period involved and the identification of an Early Agricultural Period (Huckell 1996) in the Southwest. He proposes that Basket- maker II be studied as part of this "pre-pottery Neolithic" culture or redefined by a larger set of diagnostic traits (Lipe 1999:133). Matson (this volume) further addresses the problem of defining Basketmaker II. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The present study compares chronometric data, architecture, and sets of durable material culture and rock art commonly associated with Basketmaker II sites. The method builds upon past research in the San Juan culture area and retains the focus on cultural and social identity (Berry 1982; Matson 1991; Morris and Burgh 1954). We avoid the use of an Early Agricultural Period or pre-pottery Neolithic context that may dilute the evidence of variability, but we do examine a broadly defined set of diagnostic attributes across a large portion of the Colorado Plateau. The intent here is not to amass a database of all known Basketmaker II sites but to explore similarities and differences in a comparable, representative sample. The architecture and material culture data for this study are derived from 120 alcove and open sites where archaeological investigations were conducted between 1915 and the present (Charles and Cole 2005). Sites with early corn dates (12000-1000 B.C.) are included because of the significance of corn to Bas- ketmaker II, but most sites in the database are younger than 1000 B.C. The site data are derived from published accounts, cultural resource management reports, Utah Bureau of Land Management site files, personal records, and, in a few cases, personal communiques. The descriptive terms used here are largely those of the original researchers, although license occasionally has been taken to adapt the terminology to this study. Disparities in the amount and levels of research in the various physio- graphic areas have resulted in unequal databases. In an attempt to diminish this problem, primary and supportive material culture data are identified for each site group (Charles and Cole 2005). Primary data are derived from reported sites in- vestigated through controlled excavations and supported by radiometric or tree- ring dates and an array of archaeological features and artifacts. Supportive data are derived from sites that have received more limited investigations, such as test- ing of exposed features located during survey and radiometric dating of isolated artifacts from compromised sites. To facilitate comparisons and to further reduce sampling bias, the site groups are more or less evenly arranged into larger eastern and western physiographic units (see Figure 1).

The presence of fired and unfired pottery is indicated because of the significance of pottery, or lack thereof, in defining Basketmaker II and to South- west archaeology in general (Kidder 1927). Artifacts such as bone awls, which are abundant in Basketmaker II sites but lack regional and temporal specificity, are not included for comparison. In Table 1, the presence or absence of material cul- ture attributes is identified for site groups rather than for individual sites. Material culture associations for individual sites are provided elsewhere (Charles and Cole 2005). Chronometric dates for each group of sites include conventional and AMS radiocarbon calendar-corrected midpoints or intercept dates and tree-ring cutting dates (B, G, L, c, r and v). The 399 chronometric dates from the eight physio- graphic regions comprise conventional radiocarbon dates, radiocarbon dates on annual or short-lived plants and organic and perishable materials, and tree-ring dates. The spread of chronometric dates and their interquartile ranges are pre- sented as box-and-whisker plots in Figure 3. Basketmaker II rock art is analyzed separately from architecture and du- rable material culture because of inconsistencies with regard to its occurrence, documentation, and dating in the various regions of study. For the most part,</page><page sequence="7">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II11 173 the rock art relies on stylistic evidence derived from numerous sites in the greater San Juan culture area for estimates of age. These are supported by field observa- tions with regard to the patterns of weathering and superimposition and by mate- rial culture associations (Cole 1990, 1993, 1994, 2004; Grant 1978; Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Schaafsma 1980). EASTERN CHRONOMETRIC AND MATERIAL CULTURE DATA The eastern Basketmaker II site groups are located in southwest Colorado and northwestern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Utah and Arizona (see Fig- ure 1). The groups of sites in the Durango and Navajo Reservoir regions are the most extensively studied, and research over the past decade has greatly expanded this database as well as those of the Chuska-Lukachukai and La Sal Mountains regions (Charles and Cole 2005). THE DURANGO SITE GROUP Ten primary sites (eight open and two alcove sites) are in the Durango sample. Eight of these are in southwest Colorado, and two are in neighboring New Mexi- co (see Figure 1). Controlled excavations were conducted at all 10 sites, and chro- nometric dates are available from all but the Tamarron site. Three sites, Talus Village and the South and North Falls Creek Shelters, are type-sites for the eastern San Juan Basketmaker II (Matson 1991; Morris and Burgh 1954). The Darkmold site, an open site currently under excavation, contributes a considerable amount of new data (Charles 2002; Charles and Gillam 2003). Radiometric and tree-ring cutting dates span the period from 377 B.C. to A.D. 515 (see Figure 3). The earliest date is on maize from the North Falls Creek Shelter (Lister 1997), and an estimated 350 B.C. date derived from a rock paint- ing at the South Shelter supports this early date (Powell et al. 1998; Marvin Rowe, personal communication 2000). The youngest date from the Durango site group is on wood charcoal from open site 5LP1104 near Ridges Basin (Fuller 1988). Ad- ditional radiocarbon dates are on charcoal, cultigens, textiles, and cordage from the South and North Falls Creek Shelters, Talus Village, Darkmold site, Kin'Atsa', NA-64, and 5LP478 (Brown 1991; Charles and Gillam 2003; Fuller 1988; Reed and Horn 1988; Smiley and Robins 1997). Tree-ring dates from the Durango site group exhibit clustering that, accord- ing to Dean (1975) and Breternitz (2002), represents three identifiable periods of site utilization. The earliest period, visible at the North Shelter, began in the first century A.D. and peaked some 50 years later. The next major clustering occurred in the third century A.D. at both the North and South Shelters. The last tree-ring cluster is from Talus Village and Ignacio 12:46. These dates point to construction activity between A.D. 330 and A.D. 370.</page><page sequence="8">174 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE FIGURE 4. Projectile points from Durango and La Sal Mountains site groups. Top Row: 5MN868, Tabeguache Cave I, La Sal Mountains site group (photograph courtesy of Mark Stiger, Department of Anthropology, Western State College). Bottom Row: 5LP4991, the Darkmold site, Durango site group. Many of the tree-ring samples are from logs used in cribbed-roof dwellings. Evidence for this type of dwelling comes from four sites: the South and North Falls Creek Shelters, Talus Village, and Ignacio 12:46. Pithouses, which may or may not have possessed crib roofs, are present at six sites: 5LP478, 5LP1104, the Darkmold site, Kin'Atsa', NA-64, and Tamarron. Other common architectural features include slab-lined, mud-dome (beehive), and bell-shaped cists-some covered by rock slabs or, perhaps, by wood roofs. Numerous cists, both slab-lined and bell-shaped, contained burials, many with a rich assortment of artifacts. Fragments of clay from mud-dome cists at the South and North Falls Creek Shelters have incised, punctate, and modeled embellishments including representations of a quadruped, animal tracks, wavy lines, triangles, and plantlike forms. These may be the earliest examples of architectural embellishments (mural art) in the northern Southwest. Sites in the Durango group produced several artifacts pertinent to this paper including modified bone, projectile points, pipes, fired and unfired ceramics, and objects of ornamentation (see Table 1). Projectile points are mostly comer-notched and side-notched (Figure 4). They range from large dart to large arrow points. The two hafting types often coexist within the same stratigraphic context and in some cases they are contemporaneous. The smaller, comer-notched projectile points from the Tamarron and Darkmold sites may signify the transition from darts to use of the bow-and-arrow (Charles and Gillam 2003; Reed and Kainer 1978).</page><page sequence="9">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II11 175 0 10 Centimeterts FIGURE 5. Bone artifacts from 5LP4991, the Darkmold site, the Durango site group: a) flesher, b) notched rib, c) notched scapula, d) dice. Notched bone tools manufactured from ribs, vertebra, and scapulae of cervidae are ubiquitous and were mostly used to process yucca fibers for tex- tiles (Griffitts 1993; Mobley-Tanaka and Griffitts 1997; Morris and Burgh 1954). Other bone, antler, and horn artifacts include a whistle, fleshers, tubes, dice, and objects usually described as wrenches (Figure 5). Use of the terms "bone tubes" and "bone beads" in the literature is confusing. Some authors refer to bone tubes as hollow bone artifacts and include no further descriptors; however, others refer to similar tubular-bone artifacts as "bone beads." These terms have been retained with the caveat that some may be interchangeable. Articles of ornamentation are defined as items that have no apparent use beyond decoration and adornment. These items largely occur at habitation sites where they often accompany burials. The bone beads are usually small tubular varieties; some are flat on one side. Haliotis shell disks and pendants and Olivella sp. shell beads are trade items usually associated with burials (Figure 6). Stone beads and pendants often are made from lignite and chlorite schist, but juniper berry beads were abundant in the "burial crevice" at the North Falls Creek Shelter. Three stone pipes are stylistically similar: a sandstone pipe from a burial at the North Falls Creek Shelter, a steatite pipe from Talus Village, and a chlorite schist pipe from a burial at the Darkmold site (Figure 7). At the Darkmold site, four fired pottery sherds were collected from two</page><page sequence="10">FIGURE 6.

A wood charcoal sample pro- vided a standard radiocarbon intercept date of A.D. 75 for a burial cist with one of the sherds and the associated dart points. A conventional radiocarbon date of A.D. 225 was obtained from wood charcoal in solid context with three of the sherds and dart points. Eric Blinman (personal communication 2003) reports that the sherds conform to Anasazi gray wares and are constructed from four or five different clay sources. He interprets the variability to be consistent with a situation in which a few people made pottery, and most pottery was obtained through barter or trade. Morris and Burgh (1954:53) observe that "the Durango Basket Makers may have fashioned from clay a far wider range and variety of minor objects than is revealed by excavation." The authors describe unfired clay artifacts including a vessel rim fragment and a modeled and incised figurine in- terpreted as an infant in a cradleboard. THE NAVAJO RESERVOIR SITE GROUP Twenty-nine sites in northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado comprise the Navajo Reservoir site group (see Figure 1). All but one (LA 79500) are open sites, and all provide primary data. Site LA 2605 and the well-known sites of Valentine Village, Power Pole, Oven, Albino Village, Cemetery, and Tres Casas were excavated in the 1950s and 1960s (Eddy 1966; Fenega and Wendorf 1956). Twenty-four sites were more recently excavated and produced a host of radiocar- bon dates to supplement the few that previously existed (Charles, Hovezak, and Sesler, this volume; Dice and Sesler 2002; Hovezak 2002a, 2002b, 2002c, 2002d; Sesler 2002a, 2002b, 2002c, 2002d, 2002c, 2002d, 2002e, 2002f). The date range for the Navajo Reservoir site group is from 1520 B.C. (LA 83051) to A.D. 580 (LA 79045) (see Figure 3). Only five radiocarbon dates are on short-lived organic materials. Four, on maize, are from sites LA 70667 (505 B.C.), LA 71610 (A.D. 435), LA 72747 (A.D. 440), and LA 83051 (A.D. 475). One radiocarbon date on tansy mustard is from site LA 7271 (A.D. 207). Shallow pithouses often marked by rings of exterior cobbles and the fre- quent presence of brown ware ceramics are unique to this study. Cribbed-log roofs and bell-shaped, mud-dome, and slab-lined cists typify the architecture of the Navajo Reservoir region, although the last two are not common. Bone tools are not nearly as widespread here as in the Durango site group. Modified bones are restricted to fleshers and antler tools, notched tools, and dice. Projectile points are corner-notched, side-notched, and unnotched types; arrow points are present but rare. Corner-notched dart points dominate the sample (see Figure 8). The projectile points are similar in style to those from the Durango region. Only a few ornaments (involving an occasional bone and shell bead) are reported from the Navajo Reservoir sites, and this paucity of ornaments may reflect the relatively small number of excavated burials.</page><page sequence="12">178 MONA C.

AQ In general, sites in the Durango and Navajo Reservoir regions display simi- lar architecture and material culture remains. The chronometric data suggest that Basketmaker II occupation of the Navajo Reservoir region begins earlier than in the Durango region and extends later, well into the sixth century A.D.(Charles, Hovezak, and Sesler, this volume). THE LA SAL MOUNTAINS SITE GROUP Ten sites (six open sites and four alcove sites) in west-central Colorado and east- central Utah are in the La Sal Mountains site group (see Figure 1). Excavation data are sparse in comparison to those from the Durango and Navajo Reservoir regions. Early Colorado investigations by Hurst (1940, 1941, 1942, 1948) and Hurst and Anderson (1949) with reevaluations by Stiger and Larson (1992) and survey and testing projects near Moab, Utah (Cole and Moe 2001; Dohm 1999; Hovezak 2003; Hovezak and Sesler 1999; Louthan 1990) contribute the greater part of the data. Additional Basketmaker II data are provided by Howard and Janetski (1992), Jett (1991), and Richens and Talbot (1989). Primary material culture data are derived from two alcove sites, Tabegua-</page><page sequence="13">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II 179 che Cave I and Cottonwood Cave in Colorado, and three open sites, all in Utah. The three open sites are Sandy Ridge, Orchard Pithouse, and Mountain Boomer. Supportive data are from Lema Cave and "Split Twig" alcove sites and from the open sites of Pig Bear, Culvert, and White Basketmaker. The dates for the La Sal Mountains site group span the period from 460 B.C. to A.D. 410 (see Figure 3). Radiocarbon and tree-ring dates are available from the primary sites. The Orchard Pithouse site in downtown Moab produced 11 wood charcoal dates that range between 460 B.C. and A.D. 375 (Louthan 1990). A juniper-bark bundle of corn from Cottonwood Cave is radiocarbon dated to 270 B.C. (Stiger and Larson 1992) and provides the oldest date on maize from the site group. A radiocarbon corn date of A.D. 138 is from the Mountain Boomer site (Hovezak and Sesler 1999). Three wood charcoal dates place the occupation of the Sandy Ridge site at approximately A.D. 200 (Richens and Talbot 1989). Six reevaluated tree-ring dates from Tabeguache Cave I range from 102 B.C. to 1 B.C. (Jeffrey Dean, personal communication 2003). Corn and annual plant material at the White Basketmaker site are radiocar- bon dated to A.D. 240 and A.D. 410 (Hovezak 2003), respectively, and corn from a pithouse at the Culvert site is radiocarbon dated to A.D. 390 (Hovezak and Ses- ler 1999). Isolated radiocarbon dates from the supportive sites are: (1) 160 B.C. from a juniper-bark bundle of corn at "Split Twig" alcove (Jett 1991), (2) A.D.180 from a human scalp with an attached basketry plaque at Lema Cave (Howard and Janetski 1992), and (3) A.D. 275 on a hearth at the Pig Bear site (Dohm 1999). Architectural features include pithouses, wood-roofed cists, and slab-lined cists. Side-, comer-, and unnotched projectile points and arrow points are present in the artifact assemblages. Arrow points from Sandy Ridge and the Culvert site are described by Geib (1996) and Fahrni (2004), respectively. Other comparable artifacts are notched bone, antler or horn wrenches, bone dice; ornamentation objects including stone, bone, and seed beads; and stone pendants. Unfired pot- tery sherds were recorded at Cottonwood Cave (Hurst 1948). Similarities in the chronometric dates and material culture from primary sites in the Durango and La Sal Mountains regions are obvious (see Figure 3 and Table 1). Dates from the La Sal Mountains site group span the period from approximately 450 B.C. to A.D. 400, whereas the general range for the Durango site group is 400 B.C. to A.D. 575. Other similarities include the presence of bell- shaped and slab-lined cists and pithouses. Although sparse, the La Sal Mountains sample includes bone and antler artifacts and objects of ornamentation similar to those of the Durango site group. Tabeguache Cave I, which produced most of the La Sal Mountains material culture, appears to have functioned primarily for storage, although one pithouse is reported (Hurst 1940, 1941, 1942). The absence of pipes and shell ornaments from the La Sal Mountains site group may be related to the sparse burial data. Despite some overlaps, projectile points from the La Sal Mountains and</page><page sequence="14">180 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE Durango site groups are noticeably different (see Figure 4). Some of the large, tri- angular points at Tabeguache Cave I and Cottonwood Cave may be blanks, which is consistent with these sites being used for caching or storage. Cultural variation in the La Sal Mountains region is addressed by Reed (1997, 2005) and Reed and Metcalf (1999), who propose that a Formative Gate- way tradition was operative in the region and can be distinguished from those of the neighboring Anasazi and Fremont. In west-central Colorado, the early For- mative developments (v 200 B.C.-400 A.D.) are seen as "similar to Basketmaker culture," although that affiliation is not assigned, pending additional research into the adaptive strategies (Reed 2005:31). Other researchers link material cul- ture and rock art of west-central Colorado and east-central Utah to the Anasazi (Basketmaker II-early Pueblo III) while recognizing some Fremont connections (Blinman 2001; Cole 1990; Dohm 1999; Fahrni 2004; Gleichman et al. 1982; Hovezak 2003; Hovezak and Sesler 1999; Howard and Janetski 1992; Hurst 1940, 1941, 1942, 1948; Kinnear-Ferris 1999; Pierson 1981; Schaafsma 1971, 1980; Toll 1977). THE CHUSKA-LUKACHUKAI MOUNTAINS SITE GROUP The Chuska-Lukachukai site group is in northwestern New Mexico and adjacent Arizona and includes six sites: Meat Milling, Insulator, and Dog Leg in the south- ern Chuska Valley (Freuden 1998a, 1998b; Kearns et al. 1998); Painted Cave in the Lukachukai Mountains (Haury 1945); and Salina Springs and Lukachukai in the Chinle Valley (Gilpin 1994) (see Figure 1). All of the sites in the group contribute primary data. Although Basketmaker II architecture and material culture data from Chin- le Wash are included here, none are specifically from the upper tributaries of Canyon de Chelly and Canyon del Muerto. Basketmaker II sites in the canyons are excluded due to the scarcity of available chonometric data and comprehen- sive reporting (De Harport 1951; Morris 1925, 1938). Rock art of the Canyon de Chelly-Canyon del Muerto area is relatively well described (Cole 1990, 1993; Grant 1978; Loendorf 2006; Schaafsma 1980) and contributes to our analysis of San Juan-style Basketmaker II rock art later in this paper. The span in chronometric dates from the Chuska-Lukachukai site group is greater than those of the Durango, Navajo Reservoir, and La Sal Mountains samples (see Figure 3). Two habitation sites, Salina Springs and Lukachukai, pro- duced maize radiocarbon dated to between 1750 B.C. and 1250 B.C. (Gilpin 1994). These sites provide some of the earliest evidence of corn on the Colorado Plateau and are classified by Gilpin as late Archaic/early Basketmaker. The Chus- ka Valley radiocarbon dates range from 642 B.C. to A.D. 539 but are concentrat- ed around 150 B.C. The average intercept date on annual plants and short-lived</page><page sequence="15">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER 1 181 shrubs from these sites is 219 B.C. (Freuden 1998a, 1998b; Kearns et al. 1998). No chronometric dates are available from the Painted Cave site. The Painted Cave alcove was partially excavated by Haury (1945), and the Basketmaker II architectural features are described as a slab-lined cist marked by a yellow handprint and an undefined slab-lined structure. Durable artifacts iden- tified as Basketmaker II are relatively sparse but include a side-notched projec- tile point and stone beads. Pithouses and comer-notched projectile points were present at the Salina Springs and Lukachukai sites in the Chinle Valley. Anondata and Olivella shell artifacts (undifferentiated) were recovered from the Lukachukai site. In the southern Chuska Valley of northwestern New Mexico, excavations revealed large and complex Basketmaker II sites (Meat Milling, Insulator, and Dog Leg) with similarities to the other eastern site groups. Pithouses, numerous bell-shaped cists, comer- and side-notched projectile points, and stone, bone, seed, and shell beads and pendants are reported (see Figure 8). Other artifacts include bone tubes, whistles, and possibly bone dice. The side-notched points from the Chuska sites are reported to resemble those of the San Pedro Culture below the Mogollon Rim (Kearns et al. 1998). No arrow points are reported from the Chuska-Lukachukai site group, and this is not surprising given the generally early dates for these sites. Other comparable material culture items from the Chuska-Lukachukai site group are stone, shell (Olivella), seed, and bone beads; stone and shell (Anondata) pendants; and occasional bone dice. Notched bone tools found in other east- em site assemblages are missing from the Chuska-Lukachukai sample, and fired ceramics from Basketmaker II contexts at the Chuska-Lukachukai sites are dis- missed by the researchers as intrusive. This interpretation is likely because these sites date well before the appearance of pottery at other Basketmaker II sites. WESTERN CHRONOMETRIC AND MATERIAL CULTURE DATA The western Basketmaker II site groups are in southern Utah and northern Ari- zona where alcoves and rockshelters have historically provided the bulk of Bas- ketmaker II material culture (Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Haury 1945; Kidder and Guerney 1919; Nusbaum 1922; Wetherill 1896-1897) (see Figure 1). More re- cent investigations have focused on open sites, which bring greater balance to the overall record (Geib and Spurr 2000; Matson 1991; Powell and Smiley 2002). THE CEDAR MESA SITE GROUP The Cedar Mesa site group in southeast Utah consists of ten primary sites; Veres, Pittmann, HS 4-2, HS 5-2, HS 15-1, and WJ-19-3 are open sites, and Boomer- ang Shelter, Six-Toe Shelter, Turkey Pen Ruin, and Cave 7 are alcove sites. There</page><page sequence="16">182 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE are two supportive alcove sites, Dead Dog (42SA5115) and Figurine (42SA4384). Despite the exploration of numerous sites beginning in the late 1800s, chrono- metric and excavation information are limited (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Cedar Mesa database 2003; Hurst and Turner 1993; Matson 1991, 1994; Pollock 2001; Smiley and Robins 1997). Most of the chronological data presented here are derived from items in looted and otherwise disturbed alcoves. The sites providing primary data have re- ceived limited excavation and reevaluation. Radiocarbon dates on cultigens and other plant materials, cordage, and wood charcoal demonstrate occupation of the Cedar Mesa study region from 550 B.C. (at Six-Toe Shelter) to A.D. 550 (at Turkey Pen Ruin) (Matson 1991; Smiley and Robins 1997). There are a few early dates on cultigens, but none are as early as those from the Chuska-Lukachukai and Black Mesa site groups. A corncob from Six-Toe Shelter produced a 550 B.C. radiocarbon date, and cucurbita from Boomerang Shelter was radiocarbon dated to 180 B.C. Tree-ring dates from the Veres, Pittmann, and WJ-19-3 sites extend from A.D. 106 to A. D. 329 (Matson 1991). The date range for the Cedar Mesa site group is similar to those of the Durango, Navajo Reservoir, and La Sal Mountains regions (see Figure 3). Turkey Pen Ruin is the only alcove site with identified architecture, and bell-shaped cists. Veres, Pittmann, and WJ-19-3 have pithouses that differ from those of the eastern site groups by having slab-lined entryways that open to the south. These somewhat resemble the pithouses from the Navajo Reservoir region with the exception of the cobble aprons. In general, comparisons with sites in the eastern Basketmaker II regions are limited by the relatively small amount of durable material culture reported for the Cedar Mesa region. Like the Durango site group, Cave 7 produced side- notched and corner-notched projectile points, a stone pipe, stone pendants, and bone beads (all of which were associated with burials). Corner-notched dart points were collected from Turkey Pen Ruin. The articles of personal adornment from Cave 7 are similar to those found at the Durango and La Sal Mountains site groups. The Cedar Mesa sample lacks the notched bone tools, tubes, dice, and antler and horn artifacts found at eastern sites, but two unfired clay human figurines from the study region are attributed to Basketmaker II (Morss 1954). THE BLACK MESA SITE GROUP The Black Mesa site group is in northeastern Arizona (see Figure 1) and includes the Marsh Pass alcove sites of White Dog Cave and Kinboko Caves I and II (Kid- der and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and Kidder 1921) and Woodchuck Cave exca- vated in 1934 (Lockett and Hargrave 1953). Other sites in the group are Three Fir</page><page sequence="17">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II 183 Shelter and 18 open sites investigated by the Black Mesa Archaeological Project (Anderson 1978; Bearden 1984; Boeke and Landreth 1983; Gilman and Cush- man 1983; Jobe and Whitecotton 1979; Jobe et al. 1979; Lebo and Warburton 1982; Leonard et al. 1984a, 1984b; MacMinn et al. 1984; Mauldin 1982; Olsze- wski et al. 1984a, 1984b; Ravesloot 1981; Reed and Landreth 1983; Smith and Miles 1984; Whitecotton and Lebo 1980; Wills et al. 1982; Wills et al. 1984). Additional sources of data are Berry (1982), Matson (1991), Smiley (1993, 1994, 1997, 2002), and Powell and Smiley (2002). All of the sites in the Black Mesa group provide primary level data. The Black Mesa site group has the broadest chronology of any in this study as well as the earliest dates for corn. The sites span the period from 1943 B.C. at Three Fir Shelter to A.D. 500 at open site D:11:1162 (Smiley 2002). Woodchuck Cave provides a single wood charcoal date of 50 B.C. (Matson 1991). The early Three Fir Shelter radiocarbon date is on maize, and both wood charcoal and maize were radiocarbon dated at site D: 11:1162. The Marsh Pass alcoves have pro- duced radiocarbon dates on maize that range from 500 B.C. to 100 B.C. (Matson 1991; Smiley 1993, 1994, 1997). The range of dates from the Black Mesa site group encompasses those from the eastern study regions. The earliest Black Mesa dates are closest to those of the Chuska-Lukachukai site group (see Figure 3). Two dates on maize from Three Fir Shelter are very early, but other dates on maize and perishables from the site coincide well with the mid- to late dates from the eastern site groups. The Marsh Pass alcove sites and Woodchuck Cave produced significant ar- chitecture and artifacts for comparison and most are associated with burials. The architecture includes slab-lined cists (some with wood roofing) and mud-dome and bell-shaped cists. The early investigators speculated that some slab-lined cists may have served as sleeping quarters but do not discuss the use of sites for habi- tation. Pithouses in the Black Mesa site group are restricted to open sites, unlike those in the Durango sample but similar to those in the Navajo Reservoir and Chuska-Lukachukai samples. Bell-shaped and slab-lined cists occur in pithouses in the Black Mesa sample, and the architectural features are generally comparable to those of the eastern site groups. Artifacts from the Black Mesa site group include stone and clay pipes; bone tubes, whistles, and dice; horn tools; seed, stone, and shell beads; and bone and stone pendants. Projectile points (when reported) are side-, comer-, and un- notched varieties; no arrow points were identified. Unfired ceramics were found at Kinboko Cave I and Woodchuck Cave. Excepting arrow points, artifacts from the Black Mesa sample compare favorably with those from the eastern Basket- maker II site groups. Articles of ornamentation, pipes, and ceramics are present at the Black Mesa alcove sites. The rarity of these types of objects in the open sites may correlate with the scarcity of burial data.</page><page sequence="18">184 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE THE GLEN CANYON SITE GROUP The Glen Canyon site group (18 sites) is located in southeast Utah and northeast- ern Arizona (see Figure 1). Six sites are alcoves and 12 are open sites-all provide primary data. These sites form a bridge of sorts to the Kanab site group and have produced chronological data and an impressive material culture inventory. The alcove sites of Desha Caves I and II were investigated in the 1930s and later ex- amined by Schilz (1979). Sand Dune Cave was fully excavated as part of the Glen Canyon Project (Lindsey et al. 1968). New chronometric dates from Desha Caves I and II and Sand Dune Cave are reported by Geib and Spurr (2000) and Geib (2004). Rock Creek Alcove is reported by Reed et al. (1988). Data from 14 alcove and open sites on the Rainbow Plateau in Utah and Arizona are presented in a recent chapter by Gieb and Spurr (2000). This synthesis expands our knowledge of the Glen Canyon Basketmaker II through a host of new radiocarbon dates and numerous architectural remains. The original site reports were not examined for this paper, and we do not include the specifics of material culture. The earliest date from the Glen Canyon site group is 532 B.C. (radiocar- bon) on charcoal from Rock Creek Alcove, and the youngest date is A.D. 500 on maize from Polly's Place (Geib and Spurr 2000). A single standard radiocarbon date of A.D. 230 is reported from Desha Cave I (Schilz 1979). Geib (2004) re- ports three AMS radiocarbon assays on perishables at Sand Dune Cave. These date approximately A.D. 80 to A.D. 330 (2-sigma range based on the average). Desha Caves I and II and Sand Dune Cave have slab-lined cists but no clear evidence of habitation. Artifacts from these alcove sites are similar to each other and to those from the eastern sites, particularly in the Durango site group. These include antler wrenches, horn tools, bone gaming pieces or dice, bone tubes, stone and clay pipes, unfired ceramics, and artifacts of ornamentation such as stone, shell, and bone pendants and beads. Projectile points from the Glen Can- yon sample are mostly corner- and side-notched. Several unnotched projectile points were recovered from one of the caches at Sand Dune Cave. Similar to the situation at Tabeguache Cave in the La Sal Mountains region, the unnotched points are believed to be dart point preforms (Geib 2004). Geib and Spurr (2000) analyzed the chronology of artifacts and architec- ture (habitation and storage features) at 14 sites on the Rainbow Plateau. Their findings highlight the problems that arise from the strict use of stage- or phase- based schemes to explain culture change from Basketmaker II to Basketmaker III. Pottery and the bow and arrow are present at the Rainbow Plateau sites by A.D. 375 and perhaps as early as A.D. 145 (2000:193) (which may track with the ap- pearance of pottery and arrow points in other site groups). Most of the Rainbow Plateau sites have pithouses and storage features. The researchers observe that bell-shaped storage pits are more abundant on the early sites and slab-lined cists are more common later, occurring about the same time as pottery. With respect</page><page sequence="19">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II 185 to pithouse morphology, they see a clear trend for the use of slabs in construction over time. In houses dating before A.D. 200, slabs are used only as deflectors. After that time, slabs are incorporated into the superstructure through slab-lined entryways (resembling those of the Cedar Mesa region) and, eventually, to fully slab-lined interiors (Geib and Spurr 2000:191). THE KANAB SITE GROUP The Kanab site group data are derived from four open sites and six alcove sites in Utah and Arizona (Eccles and Walling-Frank 1998; Helton 1998; Janetski and Wilde 1989; Matson 1991; McFadden 2000a, 2000b, 2003; Neilson 1998; Nusbaum 1922; Schleisman and Nielson 1988; Smiley and Robins 1997; Wall- ing-Frank 1998) (see Figure 1). All of the sites provide primary data. The most notable of these is Cave du Pont, which provides information about architecture and an array of durable material culture. The Kanab alcove sites were primarily utilized for storage and burials rather than habitation. The age of the Kanab site group ranges from 133 B.C. to A.D. 573 (see Fig- ure 3). The oldest date is from charcoal at Carling Reservoir site, and the youngest date is from charcoal at 42WS2195. The earliest maize date is 43 B.C. from Rock Canyon Shelter (Janetski and Wilde 1989). Three tree-ring dates from South Fork Indian Canyon site are 81 B.C., 3 B.C., and A.D. 5 (McFadden 2000b, 2003), and two tree-ring dates of A.D. 217 and A.D. 220 are from Cave du Pont (Matson 1991; McFadden 2000a, 2000b, 2003). Two maize cob samples, also from Cave du Pont, are radiocarbon dated to A.D. 260 and A.D. 320 (Smiley and Robins 1997). Maize kernels from 42KA3575 provided an AMS date of A.D. 240, and an AMS date of A.D. 365 (also on maize) was obtained from site 42KA3684 (McFadden 2000b, 2003). The dates for occupation of the Kanab site group are nicely encapsulated within the mid- to late date ranges of the western and eastern Basketmaker II site groups. Architecture of the Kanab site group includes pithouses, slab-lined cists, and bell-shaped cists (Figure 9). Some of the slab-lined cists have wood roofs, and there is also evidence for cribbed-log roofs. Strong similarities in architecture and artifacts exist between the eastern Basketmaker II site groups and the Kanab site group. Nusbaum (1922) reports on 31 cists and six burials at Cave du Pont. These produced a rich and varied assortment of durable material culture includ- ing notched bone tools, antler wrenches, various horn tools, a bone flesher, bone dice, a bone whistle, and shell and seed beads. A painted but unfired ceramic bowl and a stone pipe were also found. The Cave du Pont stone pipe is morpho- logically identical to those from the North Falls Creek Shelter and Darkmold sites in the Durango study region. Projectile points in the Kanab site group include side-notched and corner- notched dart points as well as a few arrow points (see Figure 8). Late Archaic-</page><page sequence="20">186 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE FIGURE 9. Slab-lined cists at 42KA1765, Cave du Pont, Kanab site group. based Gypsum points are reported from firm Basketmaker II contexts in the Kanab area (Eccles and Walling-Frank 1998). A synthesis of Kanab Basketmaker II is provided by McFadden (2000a, 2000b, 2003) who views the development as a local, indigenous adaptation that gave rise to Virgin Formative culture through diffusion or migration from the San Juan culture area. He sees continuity with late Archaic populations in the pres- ence of Gypsum dart points and observes that pithouse sites are removed from storage alcoves, suggesting mobility for Basketmaker II groups. Links to San Juan Basketmaker II are evinced by corner-notched projectile points, slab-lined cists, broad-shouldered humans in rock art, and ceramics that are present in the region between A.D. 300 and A.D. 400. BASKETMAKER II ROCK ART Basketmaker II rock art is best known from the greater San Juan culture area, which includes the Durango, Chuska-Lukachukai, Navajo Reservoir, Cedar Mesa, and Black Mesa study regions (see Figure 1). We compare stylistically related im- agery in the La Sal Mountains, Kanab, and Glen Canyon regions to the San Juan area rock art to show overlaps in the types of imagery and its use. A number of the comparative examples occur at and near sites that contribute chronometric, ar- chitectural, and durable material culture data to the study. Petroglyphs and paint- ings involving a variety of techniques and colors occur in all the regional samples excluding Durango (only paintings) and Navajo Reservoir (only petroglyphs).</page><page sequence="21">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II11 187 The most commonly documented colors are variations of red, white, and yellow. Black, gray, green, blue, and blue-green pigments are relatively rare. SAN JUAN BASKETMAKER II-STYLE ROCK ART San Juan Basketmaker II rock art is described as the Early Basketmaker Style (Grant 1978), the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style (Schaafsma 1980), and the more generally classified Basketmaker II-III style (Cole 1990, 1993, 1994, 1996, 2004). Numerous studies, beginning in the late 1800s and early 1900s, have contributed to the development of the style criteria, and reevaluations of the chronologies are ongoing. Rock art of the Cedar Mesa region is the most thoroughly documented and published (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Cedar Mesa Database 2003; BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Montezuma Creek database 2003, BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-San Juan Bench database 2003; Castleton 1979; Cole 1990, 1993, 1994, 1996, 2004; Daniels 1954; Grant 1978; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Haury 1945; Hays 1984; Ives 1986; Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Loendorf 2006; Morss 1925; Olson 1985; Powell et al. 1998; Robins 1997; Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000; Marvin Rowe, personal communication 2000; Schaafsma 1963, 1971, 1980, 1992; Schaafsma and Young 1983; Wetherill 1896-1897) (Figures 10-15). Radiometric dates are associated with two painted San Juan Basketmaker FIGURE 10. A painted "square-shoul- dered" human with hair bobs and textilelike embellishments.

Organic material from a black, broad-shouldered human at the South Falls Creek Shelter in the Durango region is radiocarbon dated to ap- proximately 350 B.C. (Powell et al. 1998; Marvin Rowe, personal communication 2000). In Canyon del Muerto, organic material from a storage structure mud line is radiocarbon dated between A.D. 120 and A.D. 340, providing a minimum age for a yellow, broad-shouldered figure and other elements partially covered by the line (Loendorf 2006:18-23). The yellow figure wears hair whorls resembling those historically worn by unmarried Pueblo women. Robins (1997) and Robins and Hays-Gilpin (2000) identify two broad ho- rizons in western San Juan rock art. The first is associated with the arrival of maize (r 1500-1000 B.C.) and the second is associated with the White Dog, Lolomai, and Grand Gulch phases (r1000 B.C. to A.D. 400) in the Black Mesa and Cedar Mesa study regions. Their early examples share attributes of the Glen Canyon Style 5 (Turner 1963, 1971), which is distributed along rivers and major streams of the southern Colorado Plateau. This is one of a complex of styles with strong</page><page sequence="24">190 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY ). COLE anthropomorphic themes including the representation of figures with body em- bellishments, headdresses, and masklike faces. The styles are thought to have originated among middle to late Archaic populations on the Colorado Plateau and in the neighboring Great Basin (Cole 1990, 1996, 2004; Francis and Loen- dorf 2002; Schaafsma 1980; Tipps 1995). Some (perhaps all) of the styles overlap the rise of Basketmaker II , and certain of these may be ancestral as discussed later for the Barrier Canyon Style. The chronology of Glen Canyon Style 5 and the relationships to Basketmaker II are uncertain. When displayed together along the San Juan River, the Style 5 petroglyphs look significantly older than San Juan Basketmaker II-style elements. Robins (1997) and Robins and Hays-Gilpin (2000) associate their later (r1000 B.C.-A.D. 400) rock art horizon with the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style identified by Schaafsma (1980) and see connections with socioeconomic developments taking place during the transition from Basketmaker II to Basket- maker III. These include the need to communicate social affiliations and the sta- tus of women. Stylistic continuities from Basketmaker II to Basketmaker III are poorly defined, although the prolonged time period tips the balance of stylistic evidence toward Basketmaker II. These style-chronology distinctions are relative- ly easy to make in the Durango region where Basketmaker III is rare (Wilshusen 1999). IMAGERY AND FUNCTION Three types of imagery are useful for comparison because they are easy to identify and occur widely in the greater San Juan area. These are broad-shouldered (or square-shouldered) humans; slender flute (or whistle) players; and face, scalp, or mask representations. Additional points of comparison involve the social signifi- cance of the imagery and the ways in which it was used. The broad-shouldered humans are hallmarks of Basketmaker II rock art, and the conventional use of these forms is striking and iconic in nature (Cole 1990, 1993; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Robins 1997; Schaafsma 1980). The figures usually have rounded, trapezoidal, or rect- angular heads (with and without obvious necks) and triangular, trapezoidal, or rectangular torsos. Conical heads are also shown. When present, arms generally hang from the shoulders or extend out and hang from the "elbows." Raised and rounded (arclike) arms appear in the Durango and Navajo Reservoir regions, something rarely seen in the Cedar Mesa and Black Mesa samples (Daniels 1954; Schaafsma 1992). Legs (when depicted) hang down or are spread in reverse-V form. When present, hands and feet (including those that resemble bird tracks and paw prints) are often oversized. The human forms generally range from approximately 10 cm to more than a meter in length. The larger figures are typically seen at sites in the Cedar Mesa,</page><page sequence="25">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II 191 FIGURE 14. Painted masklike faces with bird and rayed line headdresses, broad-shoul- dered humans (including one with a bird headdress at right), and other elements at the North Falls Creek Shelter, Durango region, Colorado. The faces overlay the upper torsos or heads of elongated humans. The faces with headdresses are approximately 10 cm in length. Black Mesa, and Chuska-Lukachukai regions where small figures also occur. Most of the Durango imagery is relatively small (r10-40 cm in length) (Daniels 1954) (see Figure 14). The bodies of some San Juan-style figures are embellished, and this is most obvious in the Cedar Mesa, Black Mesa, and Chuska-Lukachukai regions (also in Canyon de Chelly) (Cole1993; Grant 1978; Robins 1997; Schaafsma 1980). Whereas Durango forms are brightly colored, they usually lack body embellish- ments (Daniels 1954; Powell et al. 1998) (see Figure 14). The more elaborate San Juan-style figures have torsos marked by dots, zigzags, and more complex textile- like patterns and wear a variety of jewelry and realistic items of clothing (see Figures 10-13, 15). In the Cedar Mesa sample these include necklaces, earrings, sashes, and string and diaperlike menstrual aprons. A "belt" is shown in the Du- rango sample, and figures in the Navajo Reservoir region wear pendants (Powell et al. 1998; Schaafsma 1963, 1992). Some figures in the Black Mesa, Cedar Mesa, and Chuska-Lukachukai regions are surrounded and overlaid by fingerprints or handprints (see Figures 12-13, 15). Hand- and fingerprints are rare in the Duran- go sample and are unknown for petroglyph sites in the Navajo Reservoir region. Broad-shouldered figures in the Black Mesa and Cedar Mesa regions often wear hair bobs on either side of the face, and hair whorls and "bundles" are also shown (Loendorf 2006) (see Figures 10-11, 13). Many subjects have rounded eyes,</page><page sequence="26">192 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE FIGURE 15. Painted broad-shouldered humans (including one with dots on the body) and numerous handprints at Painted Cave site, Chuska-Lukachukai region, Arizona. The larger human forms are approximately 50 cm in length. mouths, and other facial markings, which appear most notably at sites in the Cedar Mesa region. Certain of the markings are decidedly masklike, and a horizontal- band design (see Figure 11) resembles that of a scalp artifact discussed later. Headdresses include rayed lines, rows of dots, one and two "horns," duck- like birds (on and just above the heads), pointed "caps," and crescent-shaped ta- blita-like forms (Cole 1993; Grant 1978; Robins 1997; Powell et al. 1998; Schaaf- sma 1980) (see Figures 11-14). The tablita-like headdresses are common (and often elaborate) in the Cedar Mesa region. These forms generally resemble a thin, crescent-shaped wooden artifact with a hole and a ducklike engraving that might have been carried or worn (Cole 1993:Fig. 9.17). Birdlike heads (and bird head- dresses) occur at sites in both the Cedar Mesa and Durango regions (Cole 1993) (see Figure 14). One- and two-"horn" headdresses appear in the Chuska-Luka- chukai and Navajo Reservoir samples and at Cedar Mesa and Black Mesa sites. Scenes in the Cedar Mesa region show humans holding or directly associated with a variety of subjects and items including other humans, "cattails," wands or standards, "seed-beaters" and "snares," crooks, atlatls and darts, and possible baskets, bags, or pouches (Cole 1990, 1993) (see Figure 13). Gender is not obvious for many of the broad-shouldered figures, but phal- lic males frequently appear in the Cedar Mesa region and are in the Navajo Res-</page><page sequence="27">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER 11 193 ervoir and Chuska-Lukachukai samples (Cole 1990, 1994; Robins 1997; Schaaf- sma 1963, 1980, 1992). Females are most obviously represented in the Cedar Mesa and Navajo Reservior regions. Breasts are signified in both regions (Cole 1993, 1994). In the Cedar Mesa region (and at Canyon de Chelly-Canyon del Muerto sites), genitals, pubic triangles, breasts, and pregnancy as well as string and menstrual aprons and hair whorls (with archaeological and ethnohistoric associations) serve to signify females (Cole 1993; Grant 1978; Robins and Hays- Gilpin 2000) (see Figure 13). Some females (married?) wear hair bobs while others wear the whorls (unmarried?). Pairs of figures, "couples," and "families" are represented in the Cedar Mesa and Navajo Reservoir samples (Cole 1999:Fig. 3b; Schaafsma 1963, 1992) (see Figures 11, 15). A variety of faces, masks, or scalps are represented in the Cedar Mesa re- gion and in Chinle Wash; some are relatively naturalistic having eyes and eye- brows, hair bobs, tonsure, nose or nose-line, and mouth (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Cedar Mesa database 2003; Cole 1993; Schaafsma and Young 1983). Handprints often accompany these images, and some were modified by over painting and over scratching. Certain of the forms display hori- zontal bands across the face and may have handlelike loops at the top of the head. These closely resemble a painted whole-face-with-hair scalp artifact from the Black Mesa region (Kidder and Guernsey 1919). Other Cedar Mesa "scalps" have blank faces, hair bobs, and loops (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Cedar Mesa database 2003). This type (suspended from a loop held by a broad-shouldered figure) also occurs at a Canyon de Chelly site (Cole 1993:Fig. 9.25). The banded scalp designs are similar to those of "masks" worn by broad- shouldered figures in the rock art (Cole 1990, 1993) (see Figure 11). Face, mask, or scalp representations in the Durango region differ from those in the Cedar Mesa sample. The Durango examples are relatively small, have eyes and a mouth and a variety of headdresses including ducklike birds, crescents (possible birds), and one or more radiating lines. The North Falls Creek Shelter has 50 or more of the red "faces," and one row precisely superimposes the indis- tinct heads and chests of faint, white elongated humans (Daniels 1954; Powell et al. 1998) (see Figure 14). A similar situation at the Green Mask Site in the Cedar Mesa region has red torsos and "chest plates" superimposing faint, white figures wearing tablita-like headdresses (Cole 1993). Flute (or whistle) players appear in rock art of the Cedar Mesa, Durango, and Chuska-Lukachukai regions and usually are slender and lack the obvious humped backs that are frequently shown in later Pueblo II-Pueblo III rock art and pottery. Some wear "one-horn" headdresses and are shown reclining or "walking" and may be grouped or displayed in rows (Cole 1990, 1993, 1994; Daniels 1954; Schaafsma 1980). Flute players are sometimes juxtaposed with broad-shouldered figures (males, females, and unidentified gender) including warriors or hunters holding atlatls and darts (Cedar Mesa region).</page><page sequence="28">194 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE Most San Juan Basketmaker II-style imagery can be characterized as public communication-it is openly displayed on alcove walls, cliffs, and boulders at and near water sources, habitations, and storage and burial sites. At some sites, the subject matter is spatially organized (Cole 1993; Robins 1997). Examples include the rows and groups of masks, faces, or scalps and flute players in the Du- rango and Cedar Mesa regions. "Females" are grouped at Cedar Mesa sites; and pairs, groups, and rows of similar broad-shouldered humans appear at alcove and open cliff sites in the Cedar Mesa, Durango, and Chuska-Lukachukai regions (Cole 1990, 1993; Robins 1997; Schaafsma 1980) (see Figures 11-12, 14-15). Both the crowding and superimposition of images suggest that the sites (and imagery) were used and reused over time. In the Cedar Mesa region, some elements appear to have been modified more than one time by overpainting or repainting and by scratching and incis- ing. Narrative themes are also strongly expressed in this region where elements of various types are connected by rows of dots and lines. At one such site along the San Juan River, typical broad-shouldered humans and "pendant circles" (often associated with San Juan Basketmaker II-style rock art) are precisely appended to Glen Canyon Style 5 humans in obvious attempts to incorporate them into "the story" (Cole 1990; Robins 1997; Schaafsma 1980:Fig. 77). BASKETMAKER II-STYLE ROCK ART IN THE LA SAL MOUNTAINS, GLEN CANYON, AND KANAB REGIONS The La Sal Mountains region contributes the greater part of the data from out- side the San Juan culture area (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project and Mill Creek Archaeological Project database 2001; Castleton 1979; Cole 1990, 2004; Hurst 1940, 1941, 1942; Toll 1977). The Abajo-La Sal Style is attributed to Basketmakers and displays influences from the Barrier Canyon Style dating approximately 2000 B. C. to A.D. 500 (Cole 1990, 2004; Schaafsma 1980; Tipps 1995). This is another of the complex of Archaic-based styles with strong an- thropomorphic themes (discussed earlier). It is rare to absent in the San Juan culture area but is widely distributed to the north, where it extends from north- west Colorado into the Glen Canyon region of Utah. A separate Archaic-based style that might have influenced Abajo-La Sal Style rock art is the Uncompahgre Style associated with the Mountain tradition (Black 1991; Cole 1990). Depictions common to both expressions are humans with out-to-the-side arms, bears, and bear "paw prints." A comprehensive study of rock art in the archaeologically complex Glen Canyon region is lacking, and much information has probably been lost to res- ervoir waters. Published accounts include those of Castleton (1979), Cole (1990, 2004), Geib (1996), Robins (1997); Robins and Hays-Gilpin (2000), Schaafsma (1971, 1980), and Turner (1963, 1971).

Broad-shouldered humans in the three comparative regions are similar to those in the greater San Juan culture area and include figures with trapezoidal, triangular, and rectangular bodies and rounded, trapezoidal, rectangular, conical, and sticklike heads (Cole 1990; Schaafsma 1971, 1980) (Figures 16-21). Figures with sticklike heads and elongated torsos in the La Sal Mountains sample re- semble Barrier Canyon Style forms (Cole 1990) (see Figure 18). The size range in the three regions is similar to that of the San Juan culture area excluding the life-size forms. As in the San Juan area, arms and legs are not always shown. La Sal Mountains and Kanab sites include figures with arclike arms while others have arms hanging down from the shoulders or "elbows" in typical San Juan fashion (arclike arms also appear in the Durango region) (see Figures 16, 18-19). As noted earlier, some La Sal Mountains figures have arms that extend straight out to the sides (Cole 1990) (see Figure 18). Headdresses, jewelry, and other body embellishments in the La Sal Moun- tains, Glen Canyon, and Kanab samples are generally less common and elaborate than those of Cedar Mesa, Black Mesa, and the Chuska-Lukachukai regions.

One- and two-"horn" headdresses and crescent-shaped, tablita-like forms (stacked and not) similar to those in the Cedar Mesa region are in the La Sal Mountains and Glen Canyon samples (Turner 1963:Figs. 73, 81, 94) (see Figures 17, 19). Hair bobs, resembling those of the Cedar Mesa, Black Mesa, and Chuska- Lukachukai regions, are shown in both the La Sal Mountains and Glen Canyon regions (Robins 1997:5.28d; Turner 1963:Figs. 73, 94) (see Figures 16-17). Pen- dants, earrings, and rayed-line and dot headdresses of the Kanab region are most similar to depictions in the Cedar Mesa region (also seen at Canyon de Chelly- Canyon del Muerto sites) (see Figure 21). Humans in the Glen Canyon, La Sal Mountains, and Kanab samples rarely hold items (see Figure 21), but figures in the Glen Canyon and La Sal Mountains samples are attached to ropelike lines (Turner 1963:Fig. 73) (Figure 18). Close relationships between broad-shouldered humans and handprints or fingerprints are not apparent in the three regional samples, although both handprints and a broad-shouldered figure are at Cave du Pont (see Figure 20).

J. Cole, personal records), and a Cedar Mesa-like menstrual apron is in the Glen Canyon sample (Robinsl 997:5.28d). Gender is less apparent in the Kanab sample, which tracks with the situation in the Durango region and much of the greater San Juan culture area. Depictions of faces, masks, or scalps are in all three rock art samples. In the Glen Canyon region, human figures have banded faces similar to those in the nearby Cedar Mesa region (Robins 1997:5.28d). A row of five faces, masks, or scalps occur at 42Gr2693 in the La Sal Mountains region. These are abraded, pecked, incised, and painted (red pigment). All have eyes; one has an extension from the "ear," and two have rayed line headdresses. These resemble examples in the Cedar Mesa and Durango regions as well as faces from Chinle Wash (Cole 1990, 1993; Schaafsma and Young 1984). Basketmaker II whole-hair and partial- face scalp artifacts are reported from the La Sal Mountains region (Howard and Janetski 1992). The Kanab region has paintings of white, rectangular faces, masks, or scalps with eyes and a mouth (see Figure 21). These have dot headdresses similar to those worn by broad-shouldered figures in both the Kanab and Cedar Mesa re- gions (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project-Cedar Mesa database 2003). A petroglyph of an oval face with eyebrows, eyes, nose-line, and triangular "mouth" with a horizontal line above appears at a second site in the Kanab re- gion that is arguably Basketmaker II (Douglas McFadden, personal communica- tion 2005; Schaafsma 1971:Fig. 121). Nose-lines, eyes, mouths, and eyebrows also appear at sites in the Cedar Mesa region (Cole 1990). Flute (or whistle) players are represented in the La Sal Mountains region, and, like the San Juan examples, they are usually slender and "active" (Cole 1990) (see Figure 18). Some are juxtaposed with broad-shouldered humans and wear "one-horn" headdresses like those of the Cedar Mesa region. Similar flute players in the Kanab area are assigned to the Cave Valley Style of Basketmaker III or Pueblo I age (Douglas McFadden, personal communication 2004; Schaafsma 1971, 1980). Basketmaker II-style rock art of the La Sal Mountains, Glen Canyon, and Kanab regions has public visibility like that of the greater San Juan culture area. Crowded and superimposed imagery also occurs in the three regions (see Figures 16-18, 21). Strong narrative themes like those of the Cedar Mesa region are most obvious in the Glen Canyon and La Sal Mountains regions (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project and Mill Creek Archaeological Project database 2001; Robins 1997; Turner 1963). Image modification is not documented in the present samples, but subject organization is consistent with that in the greater San Juan culture area. Sites in the three regions include pairs and orderly rows and groups of repetitive, broad-shouldered figures (Turner 1963:Fig. 73) (see Figures 17-18, 21). Groups of flute players and groups of faces, masks, or scalps are in the</page><page sequence="34">200 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE La Sal Mountains and Kanab regions (BLM-Earthwatch Utah Canyons Rock Art Project and Mill Creek Archaeological Project database 2001) (see Figure 21). DISCUSSION Architecture and artifacts typically associated with Basketmaker II are present in the eight regions of study, but knowledge of the spatiotemporal relationships is limited. Numerous Basketmaker II sites were occupied over a long period of time, either sporadically or continuously, and artifacts from discrete habitations are of- ten commingled. In addition, specific items of material culture are often undated. Systematic dating of stylistically significant imagery is needed to address ques- tions about regional rock art chronologies and links to Archaic and Basketmaker III populations. Despite these limitations, the existing data are useful for seeing cultural similarities and for examining social variability through time and across space-general trends are evident. The radiometric dates reported here indicate corn arrived on the Colorado Plateau sometime around 2000 B.C., and Basketmaker II, replete with corn ag- riculture, was present in seven of the eight study regions by 400 B.C. The excep- tion is the Kanab region where relatively late beginning dates suggest that local Basketmaker II populations developed through diffusion, something that is sup- ported by the projectile point evidence (McFadden 2000a, 2000b). Extensive and consolidated Basketmaker II occupations are evident in all of the study regions between 200 B.C. and A.D. 450. The lifeway may have continued beyond A.D. 450 (for 100 or more years) in the Cedar Mesa, Navajo Reservoir, Glen Canyon, and Kanab regions. Pithouse (or basin house) architecture has a long history in the Southwest, Great Basin, and Rocky Mountains. It occurs as early as the Paleoindian period and was in use from the early to late Archaic periods (Conner and Langdon 1987; Larson 1997; Lipe and Pitblado 1999; Metcalf and Black 1991; Reed 2005; Reed and Metcalf 1999; Stiger 1981, 1993, 1997, 2001; Wills 1988). Pithouses are pres- ent during the early Basketmaker II period and persist throughout with regional differences. In the Durango region, shallow pithouses are placed on artificially constructed terraces. Exterior cobble rings surround pithouses in the Navajo Res- ervoir region, whereas pithouses in the Cedar Mesa site group are slab lined. Pithouses in the Black Mesa region are often dug to bedrock, and those in the La Sal Mountains and Kanab regions are particularly deep. Pithouses with benches are found in the Kanab, Chuska-Lukachukai, and Durango site groups. Roof con- struction techniques include cribbed-log and conical-pole roofs. Mud is used in roof construction, and walls and floors are plastered in the Durango, Black Mesa, and Kanab study regions. Bell-shaped (concealed) and slab-lined (unconcealed) cists were used dur- ing Basketmaker II, and continuity with concealed storage pits of the Archaic</page><page sequence="35">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER 11 201 is likely in some regions (Lipe 1999; Lipe and Pitblao 1999; Reed and Metcalf 1999). The present data support the proposition (Geib and Spurr 2000:191-192) of a broad trend from concealed to unconcealed cists, although a mixing of stor- age morphologies within a single site and within a single temporal span is also visible. Slab-lined cists (large and small) would be preferable to unlined bell- shaped pits in soft, noncohesive sediments like those in eolian environments or in the loose sand and silt of alcoves. But why use slab-lined cists at sites with consolidated sediments capable of sustaining the more voluminous undercut bell-shaped varieties? Slab-lined cists possibly served a different function than the bell-shaped cists, or, if they functioned similarly, they could have been used for selective storage and by specific groups. Ultimately, both types were com- monly used for human burial. Slab-lined cists may have developed into the larger slab-lined structures common at Pueblo I sites and slab-lined mealing rooms at Pueblo II and Pueblo III sites. Side- and comer-notched projectile points occur in all site groups and throughout the long Basketmaker II period. There are morphological differences in the overall shape, size, material selection, and hafting styles; and the projectile points reflect developments in regional late Archaic styles including those of the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin (Holmer 1986; McFadden 2000a; Schroedl 1976, 1977), the Oshara tradition (Irwin-Williams 1973), and San Pedro culture (Huckell 1984; Matson 1991). Continuity with the late Archaic is observable in Basketmaker II use of Gypsum projectile points in the Kanab region. Projectile points from sites in the Durango and Navajo Reservoir regions resemble late Ar- chaic En Medio points from the Oshara tradition (Brown 1991; Charles 2002). Matson (1991) and Kearns et al. (1998) link projectile points from western San Juan area sites and the Chuska Valley, respectively, with those of the San Pedro culture. Small, lightweight projectile points from the Durango, La Sal Mountains, Cedar Mesa, and Glen Canyon site groups are likely to be arrow points and indi- cate broad use of bow-and-arrow technology during Basketmaker II. Geib (2000, 2004) identifies distinctive horn flaking patterns on projectile point blanks from Sand Dune Cave in the Glen Canyon region. He reports that the blanks were found together with horn flakers in a skin pouch (dating A.D. 80 to A.D. 320) and are similar to horn flakers from White Dog and Obelisk Caves. He does not see continuity in the flaking pattern from middle to late Archaic Elko projectile points and suggests the technique was introduced by migrant farmers. A more inclusive study of projectile points and horn flakers from a broader range of Basketmaker II sites is needed to support this model. Small numbers of stone and ceramic pipes occur in the database, but stone pipes from the Kanab and Durango site groups raise interesting questions about regional relationships during Basketmaker II. The two pipes are morphologically identical, which points to direct communication, long-distance trade, or a com- mon progenitor for the two populations.</page><page sequence="36">202 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE Bone, hom, and antler tools are found in all site groups with the excep- tion of Cedar Mesa where the alcove sites are commonly looted and the mesa- top sites produced little more than stone artifacts. Bone dice (or gaming pieces) occur in all site groups except Cedar Mesa and Glen Canyon. The artifacts are found throughout the Anasazi tradition, but the relative frequency drops after Basketmaker II. Gaming pieces were used continuously from the prehistoric to the historic period in the American Southwest (Culin 1907:48). Various horn and antler tools, including antler wrenches, and notched bone tools occur in most site groups where there is excavation data. Bone whistles and bone fleshers, although relatively uncommon, are found across the regions of study from Durango to Kanab. Moreover, all of the material culture categories, with the exception of bone tubes (absent in the Kanab sample), were present in the Durango and Kanab site groups. Notched bone tools (ubiquitous in the Durango site group) are present in small numbers in the Navajo Reservior, La Sal Mountains, and Kanab site groups. Studies of notched bone tools from the Durango sites conclude they were used in fiber processing (Morris and Burgh 1954; Mobley-Tanaka and Griffitts 1997), and the unusually high number of tools suggests textile specialization during Basketmaker II. Objects of adornment are present in all the site groups; but bone, shell, stone, and seed beads and bone, shell, and stone pendants do not occur equally. While we propose that the distribution reflects real similarities and differences among the site groups, we acknowledge that these artifacts are often associated with burials and there is limited burial data from some of the site groups. Oce- anic shell occurs as ornaments early in the Basketmaker II period and continues throughout. Helton (1998:14.12) (citing Bennyhoff and Hughes 1987) reports that the apex of marine shell exchange between California and the western Great Basin occurred between approximately 2000 B.C. and 200 B.C. with a significant reduction in the numbers of beads and ornaments in the succeeding time period (r200 B.C.-A.D. 700). Given this proposition, it is likely that Basketmaker II use of shell (and the corresponding trade networks) originated during the Archaic period. Although shell artifacts are common in almost all of the site groups, it is unclear whether their use is time sensitive. Gray ware and brown ware ceramics appear in small numbers at about the same time as the bow and arrow. Basketmaker II use of clay containers is attested by the painted and unfired sherd from Cave du Point; the unfired clay sherds from Cottonwood Cave, Kimboko Cave I, Woodchuck Cave, Sand Dune Cave, and Talus Village; the gray ware sherds from the Darkmold site; the brown and gray-brown wares from the Rainbow Plateau sites, and the many brown ware sherds from the Navajo Reservoir region. Other Basketmaker II pottery (Adamana Brown dating uA.D. 200) is reported from the Little Colorado River drainage south of the present study area (Burton 1993:172). These findings support Berry's</page><page sequence="37">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL VARIATION IN BASKETMAKER II 203 (1982) observation that ceramics were used by Basketmaker II populations across the Colorado Plateau by the second century A.D. The use of ceramics, albeit lim- ited, is well before the generally accepted Basketmaker III period. The iconography of broad-shouldered figures (including those with cer- emonial attributes such as headdresses and masklike faces) is shared among all study regions, and the display of flute or whistle players cuts across most of the regional boundaries. Scalps, masks, or faces were also widely represented. The broad-shouldered forms and masking probably developed out of regional Ar- chaic traditions. This connection is most obvious in La Sal Mountains imagery where there are geographic, temporal, and stylistic overlaps with Barrier Canyon Style (and Uncompahgre Style) rock art. Links to the Glen Canyon Style 5 are also possible; particularly in the San Juan and the Little Colorado River culture areas where stylistic overlaps occur (Cole 1996, 2004). There is no obvious an- tecedent for flute or whistle player imagery, and the origin probably lies with Basketmaker II. Basketmaker II rock art and its use reflect the material culture patterns of broad similarities and regional and local differences. The rock art is a sensitive in- dicator of shared ideas and practices as well as variability. Basketmaker II identity was reinforced through the public display of iconography and symbols, which additionally served to integrate communities and communicate with outsiders (Berry and Berry 1986; Matson and Cole 2002). The success of the process is evidenced by the longevity of Basketmaker II and by the ideological and material culture continuities with later groups, Basketmaker III through Pueblo IV and historic Pueblos. Basketmaker II settlement patterns reflect regional aggregation such as seen in the Durango, Black Mesa, and Navajo Reservoir site groups. The regions sup- ported large populations and were occupied for long periods of time as indicated by the quantity and quality of material culture and the extensive midden depos- its. We suspect the same is true for other study regions, but supportive data are lacking. The Basketmaker II lifeway was highly sustainable, and the people were generally well off. Technological specialization was probably in place by the late Basketmaker II period. Basketmaker II burials were often accompanied by elaborate gifts, and the inequalities in burial offerings appear related to socioeconomic status rather than gender or age. Status is also communicated in the rock art by displays of body embellishments including jewelry (pendants, earrings, and necklaces), clothing, headdresses, and masklike faces. Flutes or whistles and a variety of other items that are "held" (such as scalps and tools) also communicate status. Basketmaker II is characterized by similarities and diversity through time and across space. The divisions appear smaller and more complex than the broad ethnic identities proposed by Matson (1991) and Mowrer (this volume). The complexity is most apparent during the later period (A.D. 100-A.D. 400) and</page><page sequence="38">204 MONA C. CHARLES AND SALLY J. COLE resembles that of subsequent Pueblo stages when clans and societies presumably determined the patterns of settlement, subsistence, and ideology. The data presented in this study do little to support or challenge evidence of early population migration from the San Pedro culture area to the western San Juan culture area, but they do uphold Basketmaker II regional variation and con- tinuities with the Archaic (Berry 1982; Matson 1991; Morris and Burgh 1954). The La Sal Mountains region does not exhibit more variation in architecture, ma- terial culture, or rock art than the other study regions. Therefore, this study does not support a separate formative development (the Gateway tradition) for the La Sal Mountains region (Reed 1997, 2005; Reed and Metcalf 1999). CONCLUSION The data presented here indicate that Basketmaker II was both blended and di- verse. It is marked by variation throughout, and the differences are likely to have roots among Archaic populations as evidenced by continuities in projectile point morphologies, architecture, ornaments, and rock art styles and types of imagery. Basketmaker II was socially integrative, economically sustainable, and, in part, prosperous. The data provide ample evidence of sustainability and shared prac- tices and ideologies for 1,000 or more years. This view is generally consistent with the model of Basketmaker II as a socioeconomic system built upon an Archaic base (Wills 1988), and chronological overlaps among Archaic and Basketmak- er II populations probably contribute to the overall cultural complexity (Berry and Berry 1986). The long Basketmaker II period portends the shared culture and social diversity of subsequent Pueblo stages leading into historic times (Ad- ams 1991, 1996; Cordell 1984; Wilshusen 1999). We are reminded of the small groups who acquired their identities through a process of serial migration, fluid social alliances, and village formation (Bernardini 2005).
