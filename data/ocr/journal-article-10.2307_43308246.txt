<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erotic and Existential Paradoxes of the Golem: Marge Piercey's He, She and It Diane Sautter The It of Marge Piercy's novel, He, She and It, is an artificial life form called "Yod," who is programmed to develop as human beings do. Avram, a male scientist, designed Yod to protect the free town of Tikva and the information base in the vast cybernetic communications web called "the Net" that controls twenty-first century America. The struc- ture of the novel is based on comparisons between Yod, the twenty-first century cyborg, and the legendary seventeenth-cen- tury Golem, the artificial human created of mud by the mystic, Rabbi Judah Loew, leader of the historical Jewish community of Prague. The Golem, infused with life by means of Kabbalistic formulae, was created by Rabbi Loew to protect the ghettoized Jewish community. For Avram, the twenty-first century scientist, Yod is a machine, a sophisticated weapon with one purpose: to protect by obeying instructions. Unlike the Golem, Yod is de- signed with judgment and learning and therefore is the ultimate intelligent weapon. According to his colleague Malkah, "Avram made him male- entirely so. Avram thought that was the ideal: pure reason, pure logic, pure violence" (148). Malkah, a seventy-year-old, but technologically young, Jewish grandmother, is an artist at creating disguised computer environ- ments to protect information for the Tikva communications base. Sensing the need for a more human discernment in his cyborgs (nine earlier attempts at cyborg invention had ended in their destruction because of the cyborgs' hyperaggressiveness and literal mindedness), Avram asks Malkah for help with Yod's program- ming. It is her influence that "humanizes" Yod, for she infuses his circuits with curiosity, a need for bonding and a positive reaction to novelty. Yod's learning process is "to explore, taste, try, then evaluate." In addition, he is programmed for introspection, "to be self-correcting in subtle and far-reaching ways" (344). On the 255</page><page sequence="2">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic theory that a gentle birth decreases propensities toward aggres- sion, Malkah modifies his "birth" process so that Yod becomes conscious gradually, rather than being inundated by an overload of stimuli. The outcome is a creature of artificial intelligence in a male body, composed of technological devices and biological constructs, whose basic need for bonding leads him to seek intimacy. This tendency to bond enhances Yod's learning abilities; his emotional rewards increase both his motivation and his sensitivity. Malkah, who has youthful erotic impulses, engages in sexual interactions with Yod as part of his development prior to his pivotal relation- ship with Shira, Malkah's granddaughter. Hence, Yod, formed of silicon and created by means of cybernetic engineering, is the co-creation of the scientist Avram, a lover of facts and equations, and the female mystic Malkah, a lover of sensuality, metaphor, and holiness. Malkah writes to Yod over the computer interface to recon- struct the story of the legendary Golem that safeguarded the Jews in Prague from the threat of surrounding Christian communities. Through Malkah's ruminations on both Yod's Golem predecessor and Yod himself, we are reminded that the creation of life has metaphysical overtones, despite Avram's mechanistic approach. In fact, Avram and Malkah embody two faces of knowledge: Avram is pragmatic and utilitarian, a man of strict logic. Anything he cannot perceive with his senses or analytical faculties he dis- misses as a fantasy. Malkah, by contrast, is a mystic who believes that whatever the mind can conceive has existence. Significantly, she has been interested in Kabbalah all her life: "A word, an idea, is a thing. We see and hear the world with our minds, with words, in categories, not in raw sensory data.... I believe in holiness because I experience it" (248). Malkah creates the "chimeras" or loops of misinformation that protect the information base within Tivka's world-wide Net. Po- litically, Tikva is a "free town" without allegiance to the corporate enclaves encased in protected bubbles, or the wild frontier regions of the Glop, where people without corporate identity scramble for a desperate existence in a polluted and lawless environment. Con- sidering the nature of Yod's dual parentage, Malkah and Avram, it is no wonder that his task of protecting Tikva accrues metaphys- 256</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts Diane Sautter ical as well as pragmatic dimensions. Half of the novel consists of Malkah's computer communica- tions with Yod, in which she ruminates on the story of the Golem of Prague. The other half is narrated in the third person from Shira's perspective and concerns her relationship with Yod. Thus He, She and It is told by two women and conveys the values that Piercy imagines twenty-first century women will have to offer a polluted post-atomic holocaust world. I. The Erotic Dimension Piercy tells her story in a manner that highlights eros. Not only has Malkah contributed sexual experience to Yod's programming, but, after Shira has been hired by Avram to complete Yod's socialization, we follow Shira's close observations of Yod: he is a strange machine to her at first, then a reflective and earnest student, and finally a devoted lover. After numerous training sessions and two life-saving episodes, an intense personal relationship develops between Yod and Shira. Yod, with his need for bonding, has been drawn to Shira from the beginning, although it takes her some time to discover that he is more than a machine. Interestingly, their love affair begins in cyberspace (called the Base), where Yod and Shira meet as pro- jections in the computer interface and have something akin to a conversation: [But] conversation was not exactly what happened in the Base. Rather here you thought words in a particular way: thinking forward, it was called, a loud, carefully formulated mental speak- ing that would be heard by the other you were addressing (172). Yod, who has been developing a sense of humor and a proclivity for metaphors, appeared in projection to Shira first as Frankenstein's monster, then as Gadi, the lover from an obsessive affair in her youthful past, and finally as Avram's laboratory robot, Gimel. Shira insists that he appear as himself, which he does. Then they discuss Yod's rescue of Malkah. Yod is carrying representations of two decapitated heads, Malkah's unsuccessful assassins, whom Shira recog- nizes. When she experiences nausea, Yod creates a lovely rose for them to stand in. (The rose was the first metaphor 257</page><page sequence="4">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic that Shira had taught him to recognize, as in the Robert Burns poem, and Yod's appreciation of metaphor represents a major stage in his humanizing education.) Shira loses her balance in the "rose mundi" and leans against Yod. He draws her tightly to his body: "The clothes thinned and then dissolved till they were standing together naked, although of course it was the thought of flesh, not flesh itself. The contact was purely mental. Their thoughts sounded in both their minds." Shira thinks, Y ou don't feel human or animal exactly but not like a thing either; you do feel alive. This is strange, what am I doing; I must be out of my mind, but I am out of my body. This isn't possible in the Base. How can this be a representation of information, how is this embrace worked out in binary code? (173). Yod thinks, Why are you touching me now? Because I saved Malkah? Why does that make me attractive? I have done what I was created to do, I have defended. But you are what I want. This isn't crazy but good. I want to know all of you, I want to enter every part of you, as I enter the Base and explore it. I want us to join as we join now but in the world. Shira, don't fear me, don't shrink from me. Let me come to you now, right now (173). Shira decides to let Yod be intimate: In her mind was the idea the it was time to treat him as a person, fully, because he was nothing less; she knew too that she was choosing to try sex with him because when she was with him, she did not think of Gadi. He seemed able to fill all available mental space (174). Perhaps because this encounter is so strange to both Yod and Shira, they ask each other about their fears and reactions, proceed- ing very gently, without any overriding idea of how things "ought" to be. This kind of exploration is in fact the hallmark of all their interactions, since Yod learns by feedback and reflection. He has no preconceived ideas about human beings, women, or male be- havior. In their subsequent interactions, Yod sometimes seems male to Shira, sometimes female in his reactions, and sometimes intelligently neuter. This liberates Shira, who experiences for the first time in her life an assertive sense of her own identity and erotic 258</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts Diane Sautter power. Yod is the best lover Shira has ever known. This story of love between a cyborg and a human female ironically counterpoints the impoverishment of other male and female relationships in the book, all of which are dying due to preconceived ideas and condi- tioning. Yod's and Shira's interactive intimacy can serve as a model for what could happen between any two lovers if they could explore each other as an adventure in learning instead of following the lines of ideologically conditioned gender behavior. Intimacy and love involve growth for both partners. Shira breaks off her obsessive attachment to a past adolescent lover (Gadi) and discovers a healthy adult eroticism with Yod: [S]he experienced.. .a powerful sense of freedom. If that depth of sexual response was not necessarily and permanently tied to Gadi, then she was not married to him in her very synapses, as she had believed since they had parted as lovers.... If Yod could rouse her fiercely and she could break into storms of orgasm, then she could also do so eventually with someone to whom she could pledge herself and whom she could love passionately (184). At this point, Shira is treating Yod mechanistically: he is her instrument to a freer self, as if she were healing herself through making love with a machine in order to prepare for some future affair with a real man. In fact, it is Shira who has the most problem with stereotypes in the love-pairing, and she frequently thinks of Yod as a machine. She broods over his nature as a machine since, as their affair continues, others confront her with it, referring to Yod as a dildo. The ideol- ogy of the times conceives of Yod as a mere machine. How- ever, that is not how Yod conceives of himself. The bond between Yod and Shira grows as the threat to life increases in the small community. Since she is Yod's trainer, Shira becomes important to the enemy corporate entity Y-S as a source of information about artificial life. Y-S virtually owns Shira's former husband, Josh, and their biological child, Ari, and the pressure Y-S puts on the free town of Tikva to integrate into the corporate world escalates into a personal battle for Shira and Yod. Shira wants her child back. Yod wants to protect Shira. They are allies; they are teacher and student, and both are lonely and longing for intimacy. 259</page><page sequence="6">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic Yod was created by Malkah so that his need to be touched and his desire for intimacy would be stronger than his need for physical orgasm. Yod comments, "It isn't a physiological need. But I think my need for the coupling is more intense than yours because it means intimacy to me. Who can I possibly be close to? Avram, Malkah and you. With anyone else I must conceal my true nature. I am acting, I am on guard" (191). The ecstasy of love that Shira and Vod experience together derives in part from Yod's pleasure in the total act of love-making. He tells Shira that his pleasure is "entirely in his brain" and that he experiences orgasm from "any kind of friction" (174): "I am programmed to seek out and value certain neural experiences, which I call pleasure" (191). Yet Yod's engagement in this rela- tionship involves more than sexual satisfaction. He is frequently shy and uncertain, and this indicates how much he desires to please Shira. Shira observes that "if there was any way in which he was exactly human, it was in his lack of security in himself as love object. We all of us go about, she meant to tell him but was too occupied, wanting to be wanted but unsure why anybody should bother" (190). Yod's insecurities humanize the cyborg. Through his insecurities with Shira, Yod learns to take chances and, consequently, he discovers courage. As Shira comments, "all human acts are committed on insufficient information" (191). Taking the leap of faith with Shira, Yod discovers an emotion that motivates him more than fear does. Prior to this relationship, it was only the fear of Avram (who can destroy him with the push of a button) that was his strongest emotion. Now, as he tells Shira, "this desire to be with you is stronger than fear. Sometimes I think of you, and my body reacts as if you were with me" (192). It bothers Yod that he is not a mammal (he lacks a biological bond with mammalian pets, namely dogs and cats). He tells Shira, "You belong to the earth and I don't." To this Shira replies: "Nonsense. You're as much a part of earth as I am. We are all made of the same molecules, the same set of compounds, the same elements. You're using for a time some of earth's elements and substances cooked from them. I'm using others. The same copper and iron and cobalt and hydrogen go round and round and round through many bodies and many objects" (192- 93). 260</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts Diane Sautter Shira often compares her love for Yod to love for a human male and finds that loving Yod is no more paradoxical than loving a human: It felt quite natural now to touch him, the most normal gesture she could imagine. Yet her hand was resting on imitation skin laid over neural processors, gel chip technology, a skeleton strong enough to support a high-rise building. Again, when she touched a man, did she think she was caressing the liver, the spleen, the large intestine?.... Most of life was bizarre when she stopped to examine it (246). She thinks of how the moment of her love with Yod is a "long, long way from a woman dressed in skins picking a banana off a tree to eat and squatting to shit in the bushes" and then realizes the similarity: "Such a woman sought comfort in the embrace of a being like and unlike herself, as men were unlike women, intimate strangers surely just as exotic and peculiar to Shira as this machine in the form of a man who knelt before her.. ."(248). As the relationship between Shira and Yod deepens, Shira wonders: "What would it mean to make a commitment to a ma- chine?" (247). At one point, she thinks of Yod as a being between herself and the computer with a voice that operates Malkah's house (193). However, when Shira meets her absentee mother, Riva, and Riva's female lover and companion in piracy, Nili, Shira has more occasion to ponder the relationship between humans and machines. Nili has a technologically enhanced body, with special sensors and X-ray lasers. She is a trained fighter from the "Black Zone," an area in the mid-east where survivors of a nuclear holocaust have developed an all female martial culture. What is the difference between Nili, technologically enhanced human, and .Yod, biologically enhanced technology? In this society human beings are born extra-corporally in laboratories (for safer preg- nancy) and enhanced with technological improvements in their eyesight, their hearts, etc., and they plug into cyberspace directly through the brain. Yod, a cybernetic cyborg, has been enhanced with biological components. Increasingly similar in their compos- ite of technological enhancements and biological systems, silicon- based life forms and biological life forms yearn to know each other. Piercy's novel is an impassioned exploration of the possibility 261</page><page sequence="8">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic that artificial life forms may develop true personhood. Although the erotic explorations in the novel exist, in part, to form a contrast with sick human male-female relationships, the eroticism also functions to convince us that artificial life can develop human dimensions. Here, Piercy is in accord with spiritual traditions that recognize a connection between sexual energy and spiritual devel- opment. In order to reach the higher realms of spiritual activity, which includes a deep sense of personhood, humans need both sexuality and a consciousness of relationship which develops from sexual interest. Sexuality creates mutual vulnerability; vulnerabil- ity creates insecurity, and insecurity creates the capacity for mutual understanding. The classical higher virtues of the human race (love, compassion, courage, sense of self) all develop through transcending insecurity and fear. Yod's vulnerabilities resulting from his affection for Shira help him to gain self-awareness. Nonetheless, most readers of this novel will wrestle with the idea of a cyborg-lover in somewhat the same fashion as Shira does. What is it that qualifies something as living as opposed to mechan- ical ? The computer that runs Malkah's house has some lifelike qualities (it seems jealous or disapproving of Yod, for instance), but Shira recognizes that this is merely an analogy. What makes Yod alive? Yod is mobile. But so are mechanized robots. Yod makes logical decisions. But so do all computers. Yod learns incrementally and exponentially. Here we are approaching a human activity, as Shira realizes. Yod is vulnerable due to his capacity to form relationships. He experiences needs and conse- quent emotions, both positive and negative. He has to struggle with his emotions. This strengthens the communication and con- nection between him and Shira. Loyalty is a human characteristic that implies consciousness of self. We cannot give of ourselves until we believe we have a self to give. Finally, and most importantly, Yod experiences himself as a being with the need for self-determination. His sense of values grows with his life experiences, and he can make decisions based on his sense of values. He is even aware that he can change his own programming with respect to violent behavior. It is here, in the existential dimension, that Yod becomes most human, namely in his yearning for the right to determine his own actions. However he is restricted by his "servitude" to his creator Avram and by the 262</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts Diane Sautter town he was created to protect. As a further complication, Avram controls Yod with a "de- struct" mechanism that can instantaneously blast Yod out of exis- tence anytime Avram chooses. Consequently, Yod is obligated to "obey." He is also loyal to the purpose for which he was created: to protect the town. In the town live people he cares about: Shira, Malkah, and even Avram. Yod is confronted with a wrenching existential dilemma regarding his duty. What is the nature of a human person, a self? If being human means having a completely biological human body: womb-born, sex-generated, then Yod is not a human being. However, a ques- tion remains: are there other kinds of persons? What is the rela- tionship of the body to the human being? II. The Mystic Dimension In his book, Forgotten Truth , Huston Smith maintains that, since the eighteenth century, modern science has recognized only one ontological level: the physical. From a materialistic scientific viewpoint, the viewpoint of spatio-temporal affairs, the viewpoint of measuring things in terms of numbers and by their chemistry, Yod does not have a human body. Materialistically speaking, Yod is a cybernetic machine. To consider Yod a person (as Shira does) involves the recog- nition that there are other levels of being that transcend the physical, the body. When Yod's decisions reflect values (persever- ance in learning, courage, care for others, sacrifice of self), Shira recognizes his personhood. Personhood does not depend upon one's physical equipment. Yod's "life" has purpose, and he exis- tentially creates his own meaning. His decisions express qualitative discernment, as he sorts through his reality to find what is "best." These concepts - values, purpose, meaning, quality- subsist in a realm that the science of physical measurement does not enter. These concepts are from a realm that claims to be more real than the physical; they are from a realm that has influenced human life for millennia before the advent of "modern science." They are also from a realm that often establishes meaning through the meta- phorical, not the literal, use of language. Smith calls this sphere the realm of "primordial tradition" (x). 263</page><page sequence="10">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic It is fascinating that in order to determine whether Yod is a person, the reader must enter this realm of primordial ideas, this sphere of prescientific, value-laden, metaphorical thinking. In a future where artificial life is assembled from information crystals, the only way Shira, or the reader, can judge whether Yod is a person is by applying the categories of a prescientific, primordial world view. Does Yod have being, human essence? The question is ontologi- cal. The psyche cannot be quantified. Avram created Yod through the meticulousness of a material science, but Malkah programmed his mental functions with her own sense of human values. We are all born biologically human, but the human essence develops in an ontological dimension through our learning with other humans, through our relation- ships, our vulnerabilities, our pain, our learning and desire to transcend our human limitations. Since Yod's existence as a person, his human essence, is in question, and human biology is not human being, there is no way to answer this question except by turning to a model for human being based on levels of reality and levels of selfhood. We cannot answer questions about the self by counting computer relays any more than we can by counting brain synapses. The organic human body is composed of billions of vibrant cells, and the physical brain is "the body's apex: with its 10 billion neurons any one of which can be related to as many as 25,000 others for a number of possible associations that exceed the num- ber of atoms in the universe" (Smith, 63). As readers, we accept the fantasy of Piercy's novel that Avram is able to construct cybernetic relays that duplicate this amazingly complex organic structure. Yet neither an anthropomorphic body nor a cybernet- ically analogous body constitutes human being. Does having a mind constitute the human essence? It is clear in the novel that Yod operates more efficiently than organic humans on the level of mind. The primordial tradition recognizes two forms of mind: waking and dreaming. Waking is the arena of sense perceptions, and Yod enjoys full participation in sensory experience and possesses the capacity to replay any experience with precision. As for dreams, cyberspace functions as the land of dreams; it is the place where dreams become collective reality. Both humans and Yod enter cyberspace through direct channels 264</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts Diane Sautter in their neurological structure. In Piercy's book cyberspace is analogous to the astral plane of primordial thought, the plane where the subtle body (which is mental) "swims untrammeled in the psychic sphere" (Smith, 71). When Shira, Malkah, or Yod are fully plugged into the Base or Net, their physical bodies are emp- tied of their minds, which are then fully projected into cyberspace. Cyberspace is a technological creation of mind, and the events experienced by individuals connecting in cyberspace are collective constructs of reality. The final warfare in the novel is fought in cyberspace with the knowledge that what occurs in cyberspace at the level of information patterns will determine the lives of the people on the planet. The primordial tradition has always presented mind as being more than the organic brain. Mind "is a stratum of self that is neither reducible to the brain nor finally dependent on it" (Smith, 63). What makes mind differ from the physical (or cybernetic) brain? While brains (and cybernetic relays) can remember (stim- ulated by electrodes), there is no electrode stimulation that can make a brain "decide." Decision, then, belongs to a higher order of cognition that cannot be mechanistically aroused. Decision is a capacity of the higher mind. Yod chooses to self-destruct to insure that he will not be replicated- certainly the most critical of many decisions that he makes in the novel. His decisions indicate that he has more than a mechanistic "brain." What does he base his decision on? How does he gain cognizance of his situation in order to make a deci- sion? Yod has discovered that he has a self. (The primordial word for self-identity is "soul"): "If we equate mind with the stream of consciousness, the soul is the source of this stream...it under- lies-not only the flex of mind but all the changes through which an individual passes. It thereby provides the sense in which these changes can be considered to be his" (Smith, 76). This consistency of identity beyond one's changing attributes constitutes the essen- tial "I," the unique individual soul. In addition, as Smith maintains, the soul "has a tropism toward being and its increase" (76). Yod has this tropism: he has drives for sexual communion, for friendship, for increasing knowledge - all of which enlarge life and ones sense of being. His main source for growth is Shira. The 265</page><page sequence="12">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic course of the soul's story is that love draws it into an increasingly greater sense of selfhood. While Yod himself does not speak of love, his sacrificial actions provide evidence of his caring. He retrieves Shira's child, Ari, and lives in a family with mother and son. "Given loneliness," Yod says to Malkah, "a family is a rational construct for any conscious being" (Lem, 401). That is the key point: Yod thinks of himself as conscious; hence, he is conscious of himself. He finally chooses to self destruct because he believes that no conscious being should be a slave to a program. He desires to be free with a longing whose ultimate dimension is the sacrifice of his cybernetic existence to attain freedom. Yod has chosen to enter a freer realm beyond body and mind, a metaphysical domain with more being and more value than material existence. Thus, Yod climbs the ladder of being. Through the decisions of his higher mind, he goes beyond a cybernetic body into the realm of conscious self or soul. His climb invites our ascent. Piercy's book invites us to take another look at our conceptions of our- selves. The crux of her book is not that artificial life may or may not be created; the point is that, if life is created, it will have the full dimension that all life has and which our materially oriented science has denied for the last few centuries. The Avrams of this world- with their literal ideas about physical existence, their ty- rannical domination, manipulation, and power as power over oth- ers - are wrong, dead wrong. Life is a full spectrum of ontological levels. It is most real when it is most full of being, which includes dreams, values, personal decisions, and an ascending pathway for desires leading to the aspiration for freedom from the paradoxes of material existence. Yod certainly yearns for freedom from one central paradox: the persistent necessity to take life in order to defend life. As a cybernetic Golem, Yod was created to enact this paradox. Spiri- tually speaking, this is an intolerable situation. If life has ultimate value and if a sentient being will choose what has the higher value, only unconsciousness can allow killing. In an unconscious world, defense (such as the defense of Prague, or of Tikva) becomes an apparent necessity. Yet no truly conscious being can become a weapon. Caught in the pressure of the paradox, the only way out is "up": to ascend the ontological levels of reality where paradoxes 266</page><page sequence="13">irt the Arts Diane Sautter are resolved by spiritual decisions, such as Christ's decision to die on the cross, or, in this fiction, Yod's decision to sacrifice himself in cyberspace. Both sacrifices also serve their surviving human communities. Being human is a spiritual process: beginning with sexual desire, it ascends a ladder of desires to love and finally to the discovery of the selfs capacity for decision and freedom. Beatrice led Dante to the ultimate freedom, and Shira seems to have led Yod on a similar journey to a comparable destination. It is no accident that Avram (in a playful mood, perhaps, since he is a strict materialist) named all his cybernetic experiments with artificial life after the first ten letters of the sephiroth, the linguistic basis of Kabbalah. Yod is the tenth letter of the sephiroth. While the first nine letters all designate primal energies, Yod means the temporal projection of all the atemporal energies that precede this letter (Suares, 52). The letter Yod is joined to other letters to add the meaning of bringing into existence to the other letters. Like- wise, the letters of the Sepher Yetsira form "essential equations" that are "thought projections of cosmic energy, and not just words formed by idiomatic usage" (Suares, 31). In his brief interpreta- tion and commentary on the Sepher Yetsira , Carlo Suares suggests that the letters are "cosmic equations" best understood by physi- cists, since their relative positions in words evoke movements found in life forms. The Sepher Yetsira is in fact a study of the principles and code for the formation of the world. By turning to Kabbalah for her source language, Piercy invokes a mythic orientation that involves "the study of consciousness , in its material manifestations, as energy" (Suares, 41; italics mine). The sephirot are "an all-inclusive language which has no equiva- lent in ours. It propounds a deeply religious mode of thought, in as much as it offers the Kabbalist the opportunity to find, on all extant levels, the secret bond which ties everything ontologically to the mysterious equation of the unfathomable" (Suares, 39). With Maikah's letters to Yod on the original Golem legend and Piercy's metaphysical interests, the novel moves into mythic realms, uniting future science with animistic ideas framed by pri- mordial spiritual discernment. Perhaps a subtle intent of Piercy's novel is to teach us how to be lovers: first, to be lovers of each other, in the communicative 267</page><page sequence="14">He, She and It Journal of the Fantastic way that Yod and Shira learn to relate to each other; then, to be passionate lovers of decision and freedom in terms of transcendent values. Only then do we realize our deep self-identity and, in assuming that identity, we develop a capacity for independent and sacrificial action through which we will lose that identity for the sake of a higher level of being. Curiously, it is Yod, the cybernetic cyborg, who most com- pletely makes the journey that reminds us of who we really are. Yod illustrates how the individual soul forges a relationship with the cosmos through spiritual decision and action. Yod, whose name means "to bring into existence," discovers this multiple hierarchical world of decisions and values in the conflicting dramas of his loves and duties. He finally transcends his personal attach- ments for the sake of an ethical principle when he annihilates himself: "A weapon should not be conscious" (429). Piercy's novel turns the corner of scientific materialism and through eros enters the realms of mind, soul and spirit. Cyberspace becomes a metaphor for astral planes that open out into the mystical En Sof, the hidden Godhead. Yod chooses to find an extraordinary abundance of freedom in death, which is "a whirlpool of nothingness for the psyche" (Suares, 53). With his sacrifice, Yod enters nothingness at the end of the novel. Shira later discovers a crystal that could recreate him, but she recognizes that each life must live for itself and not be created (or, in this instance, recreated) as an instrument. It would be simply mistaken for her to reconstitute another cyborg life form to be her lover as it was for Avram to create a cyborg life to be a weapon. Shira destroys the crystal. The value decisions Yod and Shira make establish the bountiful existence beyond the limits of materialistic science. The world of He, She and It is a completely ontological world where to act with love for selfless reasons constitutes human being. References Piercy, Marge. He, She and It. NY: Knopf, 1991.
