<plain_text><page sequence="1">Time, Life, Concepts: The Newness of Bergson Paola Marrati In the fourth and final chapter of Matter and Memory, published in 1896, Henri Bergson lays out his program for the future of philoso- phy. After discussing the nature of perception and providing his ontological account of time, in what is arguably his most difficult book, Bergson recounts in his own way the history of metaphysics and its shortcomings. The conflicting approaches of empiricism and dogmatism share a common, yet unnoticed, assumption: they take reality and experience as such to be made up of what we call "facts." Both empiricism and dogmatism do not accept that "facts," "words," and "objects" do not present us with "pure experience,"' but only correspond to our human way of mapping out reality according to the necessities and needs of ordinary and social life. Perception, intelligence, and language are not, according to Bergson, tools for pure knowledge, but instead are essentially pragmatic faculties meant to respond to the needs of animal and social life. What we perceive and name, indeed, the very way in which we perceive and name, is fundamentally interested. Philosophy has failed to recognize the essential pragmatic nature of our faculties and has taken as pure descriptions of reality as such what are in fact ways of arranging experience for the sake of facilitating action and communication. Empiricism and dogmatism may differ in what they consider to be the principles of philosophy, but they share the mistaken premise that their starting point is with irreducible phenomena when in fact such phenomena are pragmatic constructions that dogmatists and empiricists fail to acknowledge as constructions. It is no wonder that MLN120 (2005): 1099-1111 ? 2006 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">PAOLA MARRATI the outcome is the building up of conflicting systems, all equally plausible and all consequently refuting each other. If it is easy to recognize here the echo of Kant's analysis of the origin of distrust in the power of metaphysics, Bergson's answer will not be to claim the impotence of speculative reason. The solution provided by critical philosophy, "which holds all knowledge to be relative and the ultimate nature of things to be inaccessible to the mind,"2 should not be the last word of philosophy. That is to say that, according to Bergson, Kant's definition of experience as relative to the constitut- ing structures of a transcendental subjectivity is no more accurate than the naive conception of experience held by dogmatism and empiricism. The fate of philosophy is not confined to either arbitrary constructions or criticism; there is "a last enterprise to be under- taken," a different method, and a different future for philosophy to hope for. Bergson describes it in the following terms: Such is, in truth, the ordinary course of philosophical thought: we start from what we take to be experience, we attempt various possible arrange- ments of the fragments which apparently compose it, and when at last we feel bound to acknowledge the fragility of every edifice that we have built, we end by giving up all effort to build. But there is a last enterprise to be undertaken. It would be to seek experience at its source, or rather above that decisive turn where, taking a bias in the direction of our utility, it becomes properly human experience.3 Needless to say, the effort of "seeking experience at its source" is not proper to Bergson alone. In some sense, all philosophies provide an account of experience, of what we have to understand as experi- ence. And, as for the period we are concerned with, Edmund Husserl, in his own attempt to find a new beginning for philosophy, was also defining phenomenology as a way of reaching experience as its source. The singularity of Bergson's view lies somewhere else. It is in the "how" to get to the source of experience that Bergson's thought finds its singular place, its singular voice. Let me underline two crucial points in the quoted passage. Bergson writes that the source must be sought "above" the decisive turn at which experience becomes, properly speaking, human. This implies that a philosophy of experience does not coincide for Bergson with a philosophy of subjectivity: it is neither a humanistic or existential philosophy, nor a transcendental philosophy. Experience is broader than "human" experience, broader than what is given to an empirical or transcendental subject. In other words, the field of experience is 1100</page><page sequence="3">M L N not constituted by, or necessarily related to, a subject.4 The opposite is the case: for Bergson as forJames, human, subjective experience is constituted into this larger field to which it belongs. From this perspective it is right to claim, as Gilles Deleuze does in Bergsonism, that the task of philosophy is not a human one: In any case, Bergson is not one of those philosophers who ascribes a properly human wisdom and equilibrium to philosophy. To open us up to the inhuman and the superhuman (durations which are inferior or superior to our own), to go beyond the human condition: this is the meaning of philosophy.5 But if experience is not confined to subjectivity, it is necessary to ask how Bergson understands the "decisive turn" that gives experi- ence its human form. What defines properly human experience? Without being able to discuss this point in detail in this essay, I would like to insist on the thought that human experience arises in the broader field of experience as such out of the needs and necessities of life. What makes it human is its essentially pragmatic nature. Philosophy, for Bergson, is not bound to relativism, or skepticism, or criticism. It may reach "experience at its source," but only on the condition that we are capable of going above its human-prag- matic-turn. But how is it possible, and what does it imply, to "escape" from our properly human experience? And what is the method, if any, of such an enterprise? Bergson will provide a systematic answer to this set of urgent questions only years later, in 1907, when he publishes his second major book, Creative Evolution. In the Introduction to Creative Evolu- tion, Bergson argues that the "decisive turn" in experience is possible because we, humans, are living animals, and as such, the product of the history of the evolution of life. What is the logic of such an answer? Let's follow Bergson's argument. What the evolution of life reveals is the fact that we belong to an evolutionary history. All our faculties are a local effect of evolution, and the intellect is no exception. If we take evolution seriously, we will have to recognize that the faculties of understanding and action are intimately related. Each needs and implies the other. Our cognitive skills, in a more contemporary vocabulary, cannot be understood apart from attitudes to act in response to the environment. What are the consequences for philoso- phy of this connection between knowledge and action? For Bergson, they are far-reaching. Philosophy has to acknowledge that we are in touch with reality, and that action cannot move in the unreal: 1101</page><page sequence="4">PAOLA MARRATI A mind born to speculate or dream, I admit, might remain outside of reality, perhaps even create it-as we create the figures of men and animals that our imagination cuts out of the passing cloud. But an intellect bent upon the act to be performed and the reaction to follow, feeling its object so as to get its mobile impression at every instant, is an intellect that touches something of the absolute.6 Descartes's evil genius could deceive a pure mind, not a living and acting intelligent animal. The same criticism holds true for Kant's philosophy: to claim the relativity of all knowledge to a priori categories of the understanding is to ignore the constitutive link between perception, action, and knowledge, the sensori-motor and intellectual schemes produced, as a "local effect," in the history of evolution. For all these reasons, Bergson claims a necessary reciprocity between a theory of knowledge and a theory of life. We cannot know what knowledge is about unless we replace intelligence in the general movement of life. Only in doing so will we be able to grasp simultaneously "how the frames of knowledge have been constructed" and how it is possible "to enlarge or go beyond them."7 On the other hand, a theory of life that is not accompanied by a critique of knowledge will be condemned to use the concepts that we already have, condemned, that is, to apply pre-existing conceptual frames regarded as eternal to entirely new facts of life. The two inquiries should join each other and push each other on unceasingly. What is already clear from the Introduction to Creative Evolution is that, for Bergson, our conceptual schemes are not given once and for all, that there is a historicity proper to reason, and that this historicity is, in the first place, evolutionary (or biological if you prefer). Our concepts are framed in an open-ended process, and, as a conse- quence, they can be enlarged. But also, and this is equally important, concepts are not generic tools that can be applied to any kind of objects. Each and every kind of object requires its own conceptuali- zation. To the singularity of objects of experience must correspond the singularity of concepts that aim at grasping them.8 If this is the ambitious program that Bergson sets out in Creative Evolution, how does he develop it? And what are the outcomes? And, perhaps most importantly, from where does it begin? Somehow surprisingly, Bergson begins in the most Cartesian, Kantian, Heideggerian way. He begins with the existence we are the most assured of and that we know best: our own. He begins, in other words, with the subject. In characterizing our own existence, Bergson 1102</page><page sequence="5">M LN relies on the analysis of time he had previously elaborated in Time and Free Will (1889) and Matter and Memory. To exist means, for us humans, to experience time as constant change, an endless flow of changes into which we can only artificially distinguish clear-cut states. Our existence not only takes place in duration (Bergson's term for this dimension of time), but more precisely it is made of duration. The continuity of time as a continuity of change is understood by Bergson as the always open possibility of the emergence of the new. Compared to our own existence in duration, the existence of objects seems to present a very different character. Objects do not change, or if they do, it is under the constraint of external forces. And in this case we think of change as a rearrangement of elements, of molecules that are already given and that as such do not change, like the pieces of a puzzle. It is because we understand change as a displacement of elements that we assume that when a part has left its position there is nothing, at least in principle, to prevent its return to the previous position.9 Our belief in objects, a belief shared by common sense, by the everyday activities of life, and by science, assumes, as Bergson has it, that "time does not bite into material objects."1' Clearly, Bergson does not mean that in everyday life and in science we deny the existence of time like Zeno of Elea. What he does mean is that we do not recognize the power of time. Modern physics, with Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, has set out an agenda, constructed an ideal problem that has become the paradigm of science as such. The inquiry into the laws of the movement of bodies has led us to consider each material point of the universe as a rudimentary planet. And this gives rise to a central question: taking for granted the position of elements at a particular moment, how can their respective position be calculated at any other moment? This scientific paradigm, and its dreams, are summed up in an exemplary way by Pierre-Simon Laplace in a famous passage: An intellect which at a given instant knew all the forces with which nature is animated, and the respective situations of the beings that compose nature-supposing the said intellect were vast enough to subject these date to analysis-would embrace in the same formula the motions of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the slightest atom: nothing would be uncertain for it, and the future, like the past, would be present to its eyes." Along with an absolute determinism, the second main assumption at stake here is the reversibility of time. This is not a paradoxical assumption, if time is understood as the movement of a mobile on a 1103</page><page sequence="6">PAOLA MARRATI trajectory, if it is nothing but "space covered," the modern version of Aristotle's idea that time is the measure of movement.12 Under this condition, time becomes an empty word: it is spoken of but its very nature is denied. In Bergson's terms, "if time does nothing it is nothing."'3 Bergson's aim, however, is not to confine himself to the hardly challenging dichotomy between the subjective dimension of time as duration, on the one hand, and a scientific and pragmatic notion of time as space, on the other. Neither does he deny science its own rights. Bergson's way out of this dichotomy will be to claim that it is perfectly legitimate for the purposes of science (and lest we forget: its pragmatic purposes, since science too will have to pay a check to society) to cut up the universe into isolated systems that can be explained in a mechanistic way, given the condition that we keep in mind that any such system is only artificially isolated. In the universe, as a whole, everything is related, no matter how distant the relation might be: There is a thread, however thin, that relates the smallest particle of the world we live in to the whole of the universe, to the duration immanent to the whole of the universe.'4 The universe, like ourselves, like the systems we isolate, is in duration. The continuity of change, which defines duration, is not a subjective experience of time, a merely psychic dimension; it is the ontological nature, if we can use this term, of the universe. Bergson's claim that "time is nothing if it does nothing" now takes on its full sense. The universe coincides with duration, that is to say, with the invention, or the creation of the new. The power of time, its own agency, is the open-ended possibility of the emergence of radical novelty. The whole of the universe is the open.'5 The fundamental mistake of mechanism is to assume that all is given: The essence of mechanical explanation, in fact, is to regard the future and the past as calculable functions of the present, and thus to claim that all is given. On this hypothesis, past, present and future would be open at a glance to a superhuman intellect capable of making the calculation.l6 It is only under the assumption that all is given that we can believe, or dream, that the future and the past are calculable functions of the present and that time is the unfolding of a pre-given program. What happens if we take seriously Bergson's claim that time is the invention of the new, or is nothing at all? What does it mean to think the power of time? And, closer to our text: how can Bergson support 1104</page><page sequence="7">M L N such an extraordinary claim? It is at this point in the argument that evolution theory proves to be crucial. It is precisely biological evolution that provides the "scientific" missing link between our consciousness and the whole of the universe. In Bergson's view, evolution establishes that duration is not only a psychic dimension and notjust an empty metaphysical hypothesis. Biology, paleontology, and comparative anatomy show that complex forms of life derive from more simple ones, that there are chronological successions among species. This is the reason why evolution forces itself upon philosophy, in spite of the fact that neither philosophy, nor science (in Bergson's time) are capable of properly understanding what is at stake in the "evolutionary fact" because they cannot provide an adequate account of the succession among species. To make his point, Bergson engages in a detailed discussion of the competing theories of evolution available at the beginning of the twentieth century (Neodarwinism, Neolamarckism, Hugo de Vries, etc.) that I cannot summarize here. Let me only briefly sum up his conclusion. Bergson argues that the two competing models of ex- plaining evolution (mechanism and finalism, that is to say Neodar- winism and Neolamarckism) share a common assumption without being aware of it. Neodarwinism relies on a mechanistic explanation that understands evolution as caused by pre-given factors. Neo- lamarckism relies on a finalistic, teleological account of the evolution of life forms. In both cases, the succession of species is reduced to a surface phenomenon, a mere appearance, the unfolding of a pro- gram previously given or the achievement of finality established in advance. Finalism is not a real alternative to mechanism, but only its inverted image: "It substitutes the attraction of the future to the impulsion of the past."17 Once again, the assumption is that all is given, but under this assumption the emergence and development of new and unpredict- able life forms remains unaccounted for, or radically misunderstood. If neither philosophy nor science can fully grasp the consequences of evolution, it is because they apply to this "new object" an old conceptual framework elaborated for different purposes and differ- ent objects of inquiry. Hence the need for new concepts. What is crucial in evolution as Bergson understands it is the irreducibility of the chronological succession of new and unforeseeable life forms. Time, duration, shows its power in the evolution of life, its power of creation: "Wherever anything lives, there is, open somewhere, a register in which time is inscribed."18 1105</page><page sequence="8">PAOLA MARRATI Bergson's vitalism is thus a vitalism of time: the "mysterious" power of life, the elan vital, is nothing but the power of time. The first consequence that Bergson seeks to develop for philoso- phy has to do with our theories of knowledge. We are used to believing that reason possesses all the essential elements of the knowledge of truth and that the very process of knowledge consists in applying to an unknown object our conceptual schemes or transcen- dental categories, as if the act of producing knowledge would be the answer to the question: "In what drawer, ready to open, shall we put it?"19 From this perspective, "we are all born Platonist," we all have a tendency to believe that knowing consists in finding for any object the pre-existing frame that fits it: The idea that for a new object we might have to create a new concept, perhaps a new method of thinking, is deeply repugnant to us.20 We prefer instead to think with Kant that reason deals only with the relative. But this is a "proud modesty," according to Bergson, and not a helpful one: This preliminary declaration enables reason to apply its habitual method of thought without any scruple, and thus, under the pretext that it does not touch the absolute, to make absolute judgments upon everything." The task of philosophy is precision, as Bergson claims in the Introduc- tion to Metaphysics, and precision requires the creation of singular concepts for singular objects. Indeed, truth is not eternal, as Bergson further writes in his preface to the French translation of his friend's most famous book: William James's Pragmatism.22 But if this is the task of philosophy, and the only ground upon which philosophy should be judged, we have to ask what kind of concepts Bergson comes up with. As is well known, the central concept elaborated by Bergson in Creative Evolution is that of elan vital. As equally well known, the elan vital is by no means an unproblematic concept. Let me focus here on two of the most important features of this notion. What strikes us in organic evolution? Let's take Bergson's example of the eye, an example arguably taken by all theorists of evolution.23 What characterizes an organ such as the eye is the coupling between the complexity of the structure and the simplicity of the function. Finalistic explanations get rid of this difficulty, assuming that the different parts of the eye are brought together by a preconceived plan. The function, they suggest, explains the assemblage of the elements. The anthropomorphism of any such account is evident. 1106</page><page sequence="9">M L N The mechanistic (Neodarwinian) explanation, by contrast, conceives of a progressive building-up of the eye-machine under the influence of external circumstances (what remains unexplained here is the correlation of the different parts, as well as the fact that we find the same organ in different branches of evolution). But in Bergson's view, this model of explication shares the very same anthropomorphism. In both cases, the process of biological organization is thought of in terms of the human, all too human, process of manufacturing. The eye is understood as an assemblage of elements that fit together in order to obtain from the different parts a common action. But biological organization does not proceed in this way: life does not proceed by association and addition of elements, but by dissociation and division-while a machine is a sum of means, an organism is a sum of obstacles to be avoided. This statement is crucial in order to understand what Bergson means by elan vital.24 The first definition that he provides of the elan vital has every reason to disappoint us. The reason why the evolution- ary movement is not a straightforward one, but is a scattered movement that goes in different, divergent directions, some of which are dead-ends, is that the "explosive" force of life encounters the resistance of matter (this simple-and not promising-opposition will be undermined by Bergson himself later in the text). However this is not the only reason, nor the most important one. The decisive reason why evolutionary movement is not linear has to do with life itself, with its essence: For life is a tendency, and the essence of a tendency is to develop in the form of a sheaf, creating, by its very growth, divergent directions among which its impetus is divided.25 The logic of the text is complex and deserves a careful analysis. Bergson is claiming that life has a unique and simple, undivided, origin: the elan vital. He is also claiming that life has an essence and the essence of life is a tendency. This tendency is defined as one that creates divergent directions among which the elan vital is divided. To assume the unity and simplicity of an origin is nothing surprising: it is the most traditional philosophical definition of what an origin is supposed to be. What is surprising is the fact that Bergson maintains the idea of an origin in spite of his sharp criticism of both finalism and mechanism. Indeed, what can an origin be if not the unfolding of an essence (or its own withdrawal, if we prefer a Heideggerian approach)? Instead of charging Bergson with self-contradiction, I 1107</page><page sequence="10">PAOLA MARRATI would suggest that we turn to his concept of what an essence is. The essence of life, that which defines its very origin, is nothing but a tendency to change-it is a tendency to move, and to a movement that creates divergent directions by its own growth. Is, however, Bergson's reference to the creation of divergent lines of evolution a sufficient argument to ensure us that "all is not given?" Does not Bergson himself reintroduce an "all that is given" when he claims an origin and an essence for life? After all, we could very well imagine the unfolding of a different program, along divergent lines ... But Bergson strongly insists that this is not the case: But, if the evolution of life is something other than a series of adaptations to accidental circumstances, so also it is not the realization of a plan. A plan is given in advance. It is represented, or at least representable, before its realization. The complex execution of it may be put off to a distant future, or even indefinitely; but the idea is none the less formulable at the present time. If, on the contrary, evolution is a creation unceasingly renewed, it creates, as it goes on, not only the forms of life, but the ideas that will enable the intellect to understand it, the terms which will serve to express it. That is to say that its future overflows its present, and cannot be sketched out in an idea.26 I believe that to fully grasp Bergson's philosophical position we need to understand that, in his view, the creation of divergent lines of evolution is conceptually distinguished from the realization of a given set of possibilities. It thereby becomes necessary to discuss Bergson's critique of the category of the possible. Let me turn to a lecture given at Oxford in 1920, "The Possible and the Real," in which Bergson carries out his most systematic criticism of the concept of the possible. Bergson recalls that, during the war, a journalist came to him and asked his views about the future of literature: I shall always remember my interlocutor's surprise when I answered, "If I knew what was to be the great dramatic work of the future, I should be writing it." I saw distinctly that he conceived the future work as being already stored up in some cupboard reserved for possibles ... "But," I said, "the work of which you speak is not yet possible."-"But it must be, since it is to take place."-"No, it is not. I grant you, at most, that it will have been possible."-"What do you mean by that?"-"It's quite simple. Let a man of talent or genius come forth, let him create a work: it will then be real, and by that very fact it becomes retrospectively or retroactively possible. It would not be possible, it would not have been so, if this man had not come upon the scene. That is why I tell you that it will have been possible today, but that it is not yet so."27 1108</page><page sequence="11">M L N According to Bergson, the possible isjust the real with the addition of an act of the mind that throws its image back onto the past: "the possible is the mirage of the present in the past."28 We are mistaken to assume that the possible is less than the real. The opposite, rather, is the case. There is more in the category of the possible than in that of the real: the possible also contains the very act of projecting this possible into the past. The possible is constituted retrospectively, indeed retroactively. To assume, therefore, that the possible contains less than the real, is a mistake with dramatic consequences. It is precisely because we assume that the possibility of things precedes their existence that, for Bergson, we disregard the reality of radical novelty; that is to say, we disregard duration: the creative power of time. Gilles Deleuze, in Difference and Repetition, provides a systematic conceptualization of this Bergsonian insight that is also crucial for his own philosophy.29 Deleuze compares, and opposes, two pairs of concepts: the possible and the real, on the one hand, and the actual and the virtual, on the other. Between the possible and the real there is a perfect resemblance: each one of them is the mirror image of the other. The only difference between them is the category of existence: the real exists, the possible does not, or not yet. But precisely because existence does not conceptually add anything new to its own possibil- ity, it becomes impossible to account for it; paradoxically speaking, existence becomes irrelevant, the shadow of a pre-given possibility. By contrast, the conceptual pair of the virtual and the actual displays a very different logic. First of all, the virtual and the actual are both real, that is, they are different modalities of reality. Secondly, the passage from the virtual to the actual, what Deleuze calls actualization, is not governed by any resemblance. The virtual and the actual do not resemble each other. The very process of actualization is here one of differentiation. From this perspective, existence does make a difference: it implies a creative process of differentiation. We are now in a better position to understand why the dan vital does not imply that "all is given." The tendency of life, which is its very essence, is not the coming into existence of a possibility. It is an ongoing process of actualization that creates new and different forms of life along with new concepts, ideas, and affections.
