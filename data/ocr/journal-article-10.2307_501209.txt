<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORAVIA IN PALAEOLITHIC TIMES KAREL ABSOLON Plates IV-V THE sensational new discoveries of American fossil man in Tepexpan, Mexico, may reawaken interest in the United States for general palaeo-ethnology, the science of fossil man and his cultures. It is well known that the cradle of this science lies in Western Europe, from the days of Boucher de Perthes to the Abbe Henri Breuil. American science possesses some of the finest works in the famous publications of Henry Fairfield Osborn, George Grant MacCurdy and many others. Only the specialists, however, know that in addition to France there is another country in Europe which is immensely rich in relics of fossil man - Moravia, the central part of the Czechoslovak Republic. A glance at a map shows that Moravia forms the very center of Europe, a bridge between East and West not only in our time, but even in the diluvialP period. Why does Moravia occupy this position? It lies in the center of the expansion of the great Eurasian migration line which fossil man followed from some unknown paradise in Asia, the hypothetical center of creation, in a westward movement along the southern edge of the glaciers covering most of Russia and Germany. In Moravia (see map, pl. Iv, A) the glaciers reached to the northern border, where the great industrial center of Moravska Ostrava is located today; the Oder river, which now flows north, was then a tributary of the Morava, which flows south into the Danube. Here the famous wide "Moravian Gate" stood open to the men arriving from the East, and through this gate many peoples have passed since diluvial times under the impulse of natural conditions. This Eurasian or rather Asio-European migration line along the Dniester, Visla, Oder, Morava, and Danube to- wards the Rhine, branching out in Southern Germany and Western Europe, has been com- pletely reconstructed on the basis of such great diluvial stations as Ki'la Nedzimova on the Dniester in Bessarabia, Piedmost and Dolni Vestonice in Moravia, Gudenus Cave, Willen- dorf and Aggsbach in Austria and other sites farther westward towards the Rhine. Most of the stations along the Danube are as yet unknown. The largest stations are in Moravia, where we know about two hundred of them. Instead of asking where fossil man lived in Moravia, one might ask, paradoxical though this may sound, "Where did he not live?" Moravia was largely one immense settlement of fossil man. There is a very simple explanation for this extraordinary palaeo-anthropological-geograph- ical phenomenon, the massed overpopulation of a small territory in diluvial times, which compares with the population of that classical area on the Vezere river in France (Les Eyzies en Tayac and environs). These men were hunters. Due to the movement of glaciers, herds of various animals had been squeezed into Moravia: mammoths, woolly-haired rhinoceroses, bison, aurochs, muskoxen, giant deer, reindeer, Saiga antelopes, ibexes, as well as their enemies: lions, tigers, leopards, cave-bears, hyenas, and jackals; smaller animals such as roe, snow hares, polar foxes, wolverines, steppe- and snow-hens. We have dug them up by the hundreds, from the largest to the smallest, reconstructing entire skeletons, from 1 Editor's note: By diluvial, Professor Absolon means what is more often in America called Pleistocene. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 KAREL ABSOLON the mammoth (cf. H. F. Osborn's Proboscidea) to the Lagomys pusillus. In this respect Moravia was a "Promised Land" in diluvial times, and became the Eldorado of hunters. The hunters' invasion was not realized all at once, but in very long intervals. The fossil hunters settled here and there; later hordes caught up with their predecessors, who moved on towards the Danube and the West at intervals of hundreds and even thousands of years. These men were carriers of a relatively high culture. They were not of the primitive Neanderthal type (Homo neanderthalensis primigenius), but belonged to another fossil race of Cro-Magnon man (Homo sapiens fossilis) with a far higher development. Twenty exam- ples of this fossil man (adults and children, male and female) were discovered in 1894 in Piedmost by K. J. Maska, others by Szombathy in MladeE near Litovel. I discovered a complete skeleton (adult female) in Brno in 1927. We are completely informed about the anatomic-physiological characteristics of these races and even about their physiognomy, thanks to the unique discovery of a plastic portrait, which will be described in another article. Wherever these prehistoric men lived, they left behind traces of their presence. camps, living quarters dug into the ground, very probably also wooden structures, fireplaces, huts, etc., covered since those days by mighty geological strata, which buried them deep in the ground, but at the same time preserved them miraculously for study by future generations - like so many diluvial Pompeiis.2 Because these invasions passed at enormous intervals and in different geological peri- ods, the culture is not homogeneous, but corresponds to three phases of the later or Upper Palaeolithic which I have identified as follows: first phase, primitive or quartzistic Lower Aurignacian; second phase, developed or Upper Aurignacian; third phase, Lower and Upper Magdalenian. I had to work hard and long before I was able to recognize the true character of these cultures. I arrived at my conclusions on the basis of extended excavations in some of the typical stations, in the caves of Pekarna and B'ii Skala, the subaerial stations of Piedmost, Ondratice and Dolni Vestonice, and near the famous Spa Piet~tny in Slovakia, and on the basis of a critical revision of the entire Moravian Palaeolithic period and studies of Russian, Rumanian, Polish, Hungarian, Austrian, Swiss, French, Spanish, North African, Belgian, Dutch, English, German, Finnish and other collections. Earlier, the experts had assumed that we had in Moravia cultures of the Lower Palaeolithic period: Chellean, Acheulean, Mousterian and younger Solutrean. The famous prehistorian of the University of Vienna. Moritz Hoernes (died 1904), was the godfather of the Moravian Solutrean; in keeping with the spirit of his time, he identified Piedmost as Solutrean. This took place at a time when Aurignacian was yet unknown, before the settlement of the well known dispute of the Abbe Henri Breuil with Paul Girod about the development and the pre-Solutrean age of the Aurig- nacian. A disciple of Hoernes, Dr. Hugo Obermaier (died 1946), confirmed the culture of the Solutrean for Moravia, although the famous king of the eolithiophiles, Aim/ Rutot (died 1933), had been the first to recognize Piedmost correctly as Aurignacian. It was much more serious that Obermaier, one of the leading European palaeo-ethnolo- gists, was misled by the extremely primitive appearance of some quartz artifacts, especially points and scrapers which were very similar to, and morphologically identical with, analo- gous tools from the true French Acheulean and Mousterian. He therefore thought he recog- 2 Cf. Sir Arthur Keith, New Discoveries Relating to the Antiquity of Man, chapter 24, "The Discovery of the Mammoth Hunters of Moravia," and chapter 25, "The Piedmost Type."</page><page sequence="3">MORAVIA IN PALAEOLITHIC TIMES 21 nized these steps of the older Palaeolithic age in Moravia, and completely misdirected Moravian glyptology. In reality these artifacts are persistent types appearing as techno- logical atavisms in the younger cultures, but being based in their teleomorphic finish on motives of convergence, not of descent. We shall return to this very difficult theme when we analyze the ancient Aurignacian remains from the B jyi Skala Cave. These stone tools of the Upper Palaeolithic and often even of recent cultures (Tasmanian, Patagonian, Old Indian, etc.) give the erroneous impression of Old-Palaeolithic Neanderthaloid cultures in Russia and Siberia. We therefore have to disregard all Obermaier wrote about this theme in his well known book on prehistoric Spain, so far as it concerns Central and Eastern Europe; this does not mean, of course, that I intend to lessen the merits of this eminent scientist. I have for years advocated the brilliant views of Paul Sarasin on Mousterioliths and Acheu- leoliths, i.e. artifacts of the younger periods which mimic the characteristics of the real Palaeolithic artifacts of e.g. the Mousterian. A task of equal importance in the stratigraphical exploration of the six localities in Czech- oslovakia mentioned above was the typological examination of thirty of our larger and more important Palaeolithic and Neolithic stations and the critical revision, referred to above, of the entire material (about 300,000 silexes). This examination was made with the help of my disciples and according to my own system. The revision was extended to include the group of discoveries of the famous Gudenus cave deposited in the Vienna National Museum. I collected the results of this work, extending over twenty-five years, in manuscripts including over twelve thousand expert drawings; unfortunately these have not been published in these difficult times, although, according to general opinion, they could have a beneficial effect on the development of international glyptology. The purpose of these laborious and expensive studies was the comprehension of the polymorphism, variety, and technological methods of stone artifacts fabricated by our diluvial hunters, as well as a complete listing of all their forms and an analysis of their functions. There is a divergence of opinion concerning the geological period in which the migrations to Moravia first occurred. I believe that it took place in the third interglacial period, and that the invasion culminated in the occupation of an isolated small range in southern Moravia called Pavlovske Vrchy (Pollau Range). There a diluvial "city" arose, the greatest cultural center of prehistoric Central Europe, which has been called "the diluvial Pompeii" by Sir Arthur Keith. There were formed the very beginnings of sculpture, painting, music and technology in daily life. Before 1922 nothing was known in scientific circles of this enormous Central European station. It extends over an area of 1,100,000 square meters, of which I excavated some 3,000 for the Moravian National Museum, with the exertion of all my forces and after overcoming manifold obstacles. This work took place between 1924 and 1938 when it was interrupted by the political crisis. If continued at this snail's pace, the 5~3rd generation of our successors would complete the task around the year 7432 - truly a tragi-comical situation. Chiefly re- sponsible for this unfortunate situation was the lack of funds. Apart from the geological and stratigraphical location and the typological analysis, palaeo-biological elements (the fauna of an epoch) are important for the determination of a certain cultural phase of the Palaeolithic Age. It cannot be denied that this is one of the most difficult problems and that here most errors are made. The great Hungarian expert, Dr. Th. Kormos came to the conclusion, based on his own very conscientious researches, that the presence of certain animals had no significance for the determination of material cultures of the Miolithic (according to the terminology of Menghin), because these forms</page><page sequence="4">91 KAREL ABSOLON of animal life exist concurrently in all cultures. I am of the opinion that Dr. Kormos is right, but relatively, not absolutely. Not certain specific forms, but the number, the quan- tity of certain animals plays a part, and thus I consider the cave-bear and the rhinoceros as type-fossil for the Lower Aurignacian, the mammoth for the developed or Upper Aurig- nacian, and the reindeer and the wild horse for the Magdalenian. We are returning to the classification used in the 1860's for the Palaeolithic age: "the periods of the cave-bear, mammoth and reindeer hunters." It is obvious that the early Aurignacian must form the bottom layer in a stratigraphical sequence; it is particularly well developed in caves and also characterized by minerals. The artifacts were made of quartzes and quartzites, materials which the cave-bear hunters found right on the spot. This is why we also call this period Quartzite-Aurignacian. In this phase the amazingly large artifacts developed, which I have called "gigantoliths" in a richly illustrated monograph. The central layer of a complete stratigraphical sequence is the Upper Aurignacian, but the thickness of this culture in the caves bears no relation to the size in the subaerial Loess stations. It is up to ninety percent Loess culture and it seems that the mammoth hunters withdrew to the caves only in winter. They already made their arti- facts from varied materials, imported from greater distances: jasper, rock crystal, chalced- ony, opal, etc. It is remarkable that the next people, the reindeer hunters of the Magdalenian age, are limited in our region to caves, into which they were pushed by the deterioration of climatic conditions. In Moravia, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria there is no subaerial Loess Magda- lenian; J. Bayer, in opposition to Obermaier, was the first to determine this, but he errone- ously extended this thesis to all of Central Europe whereas it is true only for the above- mentioned countries. In the course of my scientific journeys I was able to establish that the subaerial Magdalenian begins in Thuringia in the Saale river plains. The polemic of Bayer against Dr. Padtberg about the age of the station of Munzingen in the Black Forest was therefore quite superfluous. This station, which has been known for a long time, is not Aurignacian, as Bayer assumed, but pure Magdalenian. In Moravia and Austria the Mag- dalenian is a direct continuation of the higher Aurignacian, but it is distinct typologically as well as through the development of a great diversity of certain artifacts, e.g. very fine drills. The main difference lies in the tremendous development of the bone industry in the Magda- lenian culture. The proper relationship of the many forms of Magdalenian stone artifacts remains the most difficult problem of our glyptology. However, we can deduce from our present knowl- edge that the Upper Aurignacian and the Magdalenian are subdivisions of one main culture existing in different epochs. The length of the period during which the three phases of the Upper Palaeolithic Age developed in our region can be estimated, in agreement with Pro- fessor Soergel, at approximately 80,000 years, though I fully realize the uncertainty of such an estimate. One thing is certain, namely, that our diluvial cultures perished suddenly around 15,000 B.c. There is a hiatus of several thousand years which separates the Upper Magdalenian completely from the oldest phase of the Neolithic (the volute ceramics) which is dated about 4,000 B.c. This gap shows only insignificant traces of today's forest fauna in its lime stratum, but is completely devoid of any trace of the presence of man. Therefore we do not have any Mesolithic remains in Moravia to this day. Why did this lacuna arise -a chasm which neither the palaeo-ethnologists nor the pre- historians have been able to bridge? What caused the destruction of fossil man and his remarkable culture? If it was merely a climatic catastrophe, it must have been of gigantic dimensions and universal, since, along with man, the accompanying diluvial animal world</page><page sequence="5">MORAVIA IN PALAEOLITHIC TIMES 23 disappeared completely, including mammoths and rhinoceroses, giant deer, bison and aurochs, cave-bears, lions, tigers, hyenas, Saiga antelopes, herds of innumerable reindeer, wild horses, etc. Such a tremendous cataclysm had to have as its cause natural events of equal size and importance. We shall return to a detailed examination of the hiatus, and to its relation to the Atlantis problem, in later articles dealing with the exploration of the Pekarna and ByMi Sk6la caves in Moravia. Palaeo-ethnology and anthropology are recent sciences. The Viennese Anthropological Society was founded in 1870 by the great Viennese physician Baron Rokytansky, partly because of the great wealth of prehistoric discoveries in Moravia. At that time Henry Wankel (1821-1897), a simple country doctor, was active in Moravia; in 1888 he was called the "father of Austrian prehistoric archaeology" by the immortal Danish zoologist, Japetus Steenstrup, discoverer of the Kjckkenmoddings and the change of generations. In 1867 Wankel discovered Palaeolithic cultures for the first time in Europe, on the classical site of the Byji Skala cave. He even interpreted these cultures correctly and distinguished two typological phases: the older phase dating from the cave-bear hunters equated with the French Mousterian, and the younger phase dating from the reindeer hunters which he equated with the West European Magdalenian. In the latter stratum he discovered the first human fossil skeleton in Central Europe, a female of the Cro-Magnon race. This he described in an accurately read stratigraphical interpretation of five superimposed strata in which he even identified the hiatus separating the Holocene from the Pleistocene stratum below. The date of his discovery and correct interpretation - 1867 -can be duly appreciated by students of the history of our science. Wankel himself did not realize the importance of his discovery. He considered it to be of local importance only, so that the leading French palaeo-ethnologists had no knowledge of it. Wankel's merits were fully appreciated only by our generation; a similar fate was shared by another famous Moravian scientist, Gregor Mendel, a contemporary of Wankel. Wankel made another sensational discovery in the Byci Skala cave: a funeral site of a chieftain of the Hallstatt period which contained unique treasures including the oldest cast iron object in the world, a cast iron ring dating from the sixth century B.c. Wankel, one of the founders of the general Central European speleology, biospeleology, palaeontology, and hydrography, also built in 1850 the first cenozoic laboratory in Blansko (Moravia). There he reconstructed complete skeletons of cave-bears, cave-lions, cave-hyenas, and other ani- mals. In 1879 he discovered Predmost which later acquired world-wide fame. In 1884 he founded a national museum in Olomouc, the second city of Moravia, which possesses one of the greatest prehistoric collections in Central Europe. I have had to deal with Wankel in some detail since it was his research which laid the foundation for the later exploration of Palaeolithic Moravia. His example exerted great and lasting influence. He was followed by a large number of disciples in Moravia who did prehistoric work in many fields. Papers by two of them, K. J. Maika and M. Klii, were published in the Paris journal, L'Anthropologie. Maika and Klii, both of whom died in 1916, explored Piedmost, and the latter also the caves of Kiilna and Pekirna. As the successor of these three men, I started in 1917 to build up a special cenozoic de- partment in the Moravian National Museum in Brno, in which were concentrated the col- lections of Maika and Ki~i and all other Palaeolithic collections which had been in private hands. Since 1992 I have organized systematic excavations on the great Moravian sites. In 1998 I created a special research institute in Brno, "Anthropos," under the patronage of the provincial government. I should like to mention some international highlights of our work in Moravia. In 193</page><page sequence="6">24 KAREL ABSOLON the Abbe Henri Breuil, the representative of international palaeo-ethnology and the teacher of whole generations, visited us for weeks of study. In 1994 the Third Congress of the Institut International d'Anthropologie took place in Brno, attended by Dr. Capitan, Dr. Pittard, Count B6gouen, Kleiweg de Zwaan, Milles Burkitt, Dorothy Garrod and over seventy leading prehistorians of many nations. We received a strong impetus from the re- peated visits of our American colleagues during the late twenties: Mrs. Mitchell Caroll, Dr. W. F. Jakobs, Dr. Paul Gattes Kreider, Dr. G. W. Riley, Prof. George L. Collie et al. In particular there was the participation of the American School of Prehistoric Research in association with the Archaeological Institute of America, led by Professor George Grant MacCurdy and his assistants including Dr. Henry Field, in the excavations at Dolni Ves- tonice, Pekirna and Piedmost. In a critical discussion they made important contributions to the clarification of disputed questions, especially the difficult problem of the relation of the Aurignacian cave to Loess stations.3 Their visit left a profound impression in Czechoslo- vakia. Travelling south from Brno, the capital of Moravia, towards Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, one cannot help but notice an isolated small range of hills rising suddenly from the southern Moravian plains (see map, pl. Iv, A). This is called the Pollau Range (Pav- lovsk6 Vrchy). Formerly it was believed that this elevation, which covers merely 122 square kilometers, formed part of the Alps; but we now know on the basis of their geological struc- ture that these hills belong to the Carpathians. This small Karst region, consisting of Jurassic limestone, had been popular with local tourists and naturalists, but acquired world fame only in our generation, when one of the greatest Palaeolithic stations in the world was discovered there in 1922 and explored by me since 1924. I intend to devote a special article to the history of the exploration of this gigantic station which has been named after the nearby village of Dolni Ve'stonice (Unter-Wisternitz), where we had our headquarters and laboratory. The systematic exploration of every square yard of the site, by which I had intended to arrive first of all at a later palaeo-ethnological reconstruction of the station, produced immense quantities of relics of the culture of the Central European Upper Aurignacian. Enormous fire sites and extended accumulations of mammoth bones (diluvial Kjokkenmoddings), gave a new confirmation of the formerly dis- puted question of the contemporaneity of mammoth and man (Japetus Steenstrup, Othenio Abel). We found great quantities of stone and bone implements, stone-workers' shops, ornaments, fighting and hunting weapons, extensive palaeontological material, heads of fossil man, and in particular diluvial ceramics, a complete innovation for palaeo-ethnology. When our workmen showed me the first of these ceramics, the small head of a bear (pl. Iv, B), on August 21st, 1924, I was so taken aback that I thought at first that this was due to the secondary infiltration of a Neolithic layer into the diluvial, so strongly did we think of ceramic objects as an important characteristic of the Neolithic culture. But when a com- mission of three members examined the whole situation on the following day, the depth of the undisturbed layer in which the bear's head had been found left no doubt that it came from a primary diluvial stratum. In this way the tiny sculpture became the beginning of one of the most interesting chapters of recent palaeo-ethnology, for we subsequently un- covered a whole collection of diluvial sculptures. The very expression "diluvial ceramics" would have been considered absurd and a fla- grant error by all prehistorians before the discoveries at Dolni Vistonice. Since Evans' 3 Cf. the third monograph of D. Vestonice, 1945, pp. 10-13, 16, 19, 24-25.</page><page sequence="7">MORAVIA IN PALAEOLITHIC TIMES 25 categorical statement about the absence of pottery from Palaeolithic deposits, either no mention has been made in English manuals of Palaeolithic ceramics (Munro, Sollas, Bur- kitt), or recognition has been refused to them (Macalister). Therefore ceramics were con- sidered a nonexistent anachronism for the diluvial, and the forming period of objects from clay was held to be an accomplishment of the Neolithic Age. Now we know that the mam- moth hunters had discovered it much earlier in order to give expression to their artistic im- pulses. Some of the sculptures found in Dolni Vestonice represent animals; others are anthropo- morphic statuettes. The animal figures are all ceramic, the anthropomorphic figures are either ceramic or made of mammoth ivory. The heads of animals were the most common: three bear heads, two each of lions, wolverines, ice foxes, rhinoceroses, reindeer, wild horses, owls, etc. There are whole figures of bears, wolverines, bison and mammoths, miniature plastic figures such as bears 74 and 47 mm. long, a beautiful mammoth measuring 40 mm. (pl. Iv, c), the wolverine of Piedmost 45 mm., etc. Some of the sizes of the animal heads are: bear 30 mm., reindeer 38 mm. (pl. v, A), rhinoceros 40 mm. (pl. v, B), ice fox only 15 mm. - our smallest sculpture. The material of which these statuettes were made is always the same: silicated and car- bonized bones, such as ivory, ground to dust, mixed with Loess and grease to form a knead- able substance- a diluvial artist's paste. The chemical formula of this material is CO3 SO,2 P04 CA Fe Mg. Originally soft, then dried in fire, these statuettes became fossilized into the hardness of stone in the course of tens of thousands of years. All these statuettes were masterfully true to nature, so that in spite of the smallness of the object one can identify the animal represented at the first glance only one head of a reindeer has been ideoplastically, geometrically stylized through the use of a decorative motive, parallel, deeply engraved ridges. This figure (pl. v, c) looks somewhat exotic at first sight, and it was entered as a "crocodile" into the work records. An artistic-morpho- logical analysis makes it possible to identify this figure beyond a doubt as the head of a reindeer. The head of a lioness (pl. v, D) has been modelled in such a masterly fashion, in spite of its small size, that it has been called "a rare gem, the crown of the world's diluvial plastic art." Scientifically of the greatest value are two heads of cave-bears, a pair of sisters, equally large and modelled in the same fashion, so that there is no doubt that the artist duplicated his own work. They were found next to each other on the site of the "mystical hunters' cult" mentioned below, together with some dyestuffs, in August 1934. Just because these two heads have been formed after the same fashion, it is possible to recognize a remarkable tendency in one of them. The first has been modelled bilaterally in symmetrical proportion, while the second (pl. v, E) is true to nature only on the right side, being strangely disfigured on the left side; it bears an artificial wound, deep holes in the place of eye and temple and above the ear. It may have been the intention of the primitive hunters to correct the fortune of the chase, so that they would be able to catch their prey by a mighty spear thrust into the left eye or temple. Through a remarkable coincidence I have seen a perfect analogy in a parietal drawing discovered by Professor B~gouen in the miraculous cave in the Pyrenees, "Des Trois Frdres." There we can admire a stoned cave-bear, bleeding profusely from nostrils, eye and temple (see fig. 1). Motives of the same ideology, a drawing in the Pyre- nees, and some 800 miles away as the crow flies, a statuette in Moravia -the same human- kind, widely separated in time and space. Most of these statuettes were discovered in one area in the years 1933 and 1934. It is a</page><page sequence="8">26 KAREL ABSOLON particularly exposed spur of land, a location which attracted my attention from the very first day, and I certainly was not disappointed. On an area of about 400 square meters, not deep below the surface -the Loess had been blown away on this exposed point in the course of time -there was an amazing number of stone, bone and ceramic objects, dyestuffs and scrapers, necklaces and perforated teeth, a beautifully ornamented spoon of mammoth ivory 40 cm. long, and other implements. In a burned layer, mixed with carbonized bones, there were several Venus statuettes, also a male figure, which is very rare in diluvial art, and finally an extremely important amulet, a perfect artificially perforated fossil human front tooth, probably a war trophy. The heart of this area was an irregularly shaped fire site of 107 square meters. Discoloring made it possible to identify the outline of the site quite accurately. At the fire site itself and in its surroundings were found hundreds of these strange objects, including ten complete ceramic pieces: bears, a legless whole figure, lions, mammoths, horses, the "crocodile" reindeer (pl. v, c), a snow-owl and a handful of unfinished, sketchily modelled forms. It looked as if fossil man had scattered these precious objects around the fire place with re- (O FIG. 1. WOUNDED CAVE BEAR peated swings of his hands. I emphasize that rubbing stones with red and yellow dyes lay in the center of the fire place, which is always significant. Many of the bone objects were dyed red. There were hundreds of stone artifacts of exquisite quality. A description of this fire site and all the objects found there alone provides material for a richly illustrated mono- graph. In these circumstances I feel justified in assuming that we are facing here the scene of a mystic cult of the mammoth hunters, the full significance of which can only be ap- preciated within the frame of an overall picture of the gigantic station, where we found sev- eral such sites. Does the fact that most of the animal sculptures are only heads have an intentional sig- nificance? I cannot decide this question, but would like to point out the following. The well known Magic Staff4 found in the Abri Mege in Teyjat near Nontron, France, shows a strange drawing of a horse. Only the front part, with just one front leg without hooves has been drawn, leaving out the greater part of the body and three legs, although the artist had plenty of space for a complete drawing. This is no accident, but an intentional reduction of the drawing. It shows the influence of a notion analogous, for instance, to that of the Eskimo, who draw human figures reduced to head, chest and arms, and reindeer without antlers or legs. These are magic, morbidly naive notions going back to shamanistic influ- ences. * Masterfully interpreted in 1909 by L. Capitan, H. Breuil, P. Bourinet and ID. Peyrony in the Revue de l'Ecole d'Anthropologie, xix.</page><page sequence="9">MORAVIA IN PALAEOLITHIC TIMES 27 We shall say no more about the question of the bodiless heads at this point. However, we can be much more certain about the meaning of the legless statuette of a cave bear (pl. v, F). It is a perfect statuette without the four legs, which were certainly not broken off. The diluvial hunter never formed the legs with the body, but attached blunt stumps to the rump. We know from comparative prehistoric and recent ethnology that this fact has a deeper significance. The unsophisticated diluvial hunter wanted to achieve remote control over his chase by magic, by depicting a certain phenomenon: his grim foe, the cave-bear, was not to escape him, being legless! We can see how important for our science was the discovery of diluvial ceramic sculpture -not only for the morphology of art, but also for ethnology. With its help we have been able to penetrate a little into the spiritual life of the mammoth hunters. After the first dis- coveries of these statuettes it was not quite clear whether or not they were children's toys, but now we are certain that they were connected with a cult. In Moravia the ceramic statuettes are not limited to Dolni Vestonice; recently Piedmost also has furnished a precious complete statuette of a wolverine. In the course of our work we also found geometrical line drawings in our giant station. They are few in number, simple in execution and do not compare with the sculptures in number or quality. We see that plastic art is older than drawing. According to the onto- genetic laws children also start with their plastic toys and only later the talented ones de- velop their inclinations for drawing. The dominant position of sculpture at the very begin- ning of art appears strange in other times. The later nineteenth century concentrated its energy so completely on painting, that no interest remained for sculpture. Perhaps such a change of artistic emphasis took place for the first time between the Aurignacian period and the Magdalenian. Students of cultural history have frequently expressed surprise that the craft of stone- grinding had not been discovered by Palaeolithic man in the diluvial stone implement in- dustry. Mutatis mutandis we may express surprise that the highly intelligent mammoth hunters did not use their skill in the modelling of statuettes for simpler and more useful things, for instance household implements, especially vessels. The evolution of the Moravian diluvial ceramics is of great importance for the evolution of proto-Neolithic culture. Dr. O. Menghin shares the opinion that this free modelling method is the beginning of ceramics. This is important, because the question of the origin of ceramics is one of the darkest prob- lems of palaeo-ethnology. The oldest proofs of ceramic art with an established age are from the Belgian early Campignian and the Brandenburg early Tardenoisian; obviously ceramic art was not invented there, but must have had its precursors in preceding periods. It is also a known fact that there have been several announcements of discoveries of Palaeolithic pottery in Italy, France, Belgium, more recently also from England and Ger- many. From Italy U. Rellini (1920), U. Botti and C. de Stefani (1916) announced potsherds from Palaeolithic strata of various caves, which claim was rightly refuted by R. Vaufrey (1928) and H. Obermaier (Reallexikon, 1926). Similar discoveries in France and Belgium have been treated very critically by J. Dechelette in his Manuel d'archuologie prehistorique, chapter vi, "La Potterie B l'epoque du Renne," pp. 169-171. On the other hand, Palaeo- lithic pottery was considered assured by the Belgian scientists A. Rutot, J. Fraipont and G. Engerrand, especially the finds in the Neanderthal layers of the Spy cave; this was certainly erroneous. I must recall, however, that during the excavations of HI. Martin in La Quina, another Neanderthal station, the well known prehistorian E. Tate discovered in the undis- turbed Mousterian layer a perfect fossilized loam spheroid, which could only have been</page><page sequence="10">28 KAREL ABSOLON made by man and should be considered to be the oldest ceramic object in the world. Of course, a spheroid is not pottery. It is interesting that in 1908 Rutot intuitively, without proof, placed the beginning of ceramics in the Aurignacian, for which he was severely taken to task by M. Hoernes. Our ceramics from the Moravian Aurignacian culture certainly vindicates Rutot, with whom I conferred many hours in 1930. He had genius, but could also err very badly (Eolithism). We already mentioned the negative attitude of the British scientists towards "Palaeo- lithic pottery." In spite of that, J. P. T. Burchell and J. Reid Moir announced the discovery of a late Palaeolithic ceramic from Ipswich and Swanscombe with great stratigraphical certainty. I personally studied this stratigraphy on the spot in 1931 together with J. Reid Moir and G. Mainard, and have found it unquestionable; but perhaps all three of us were wrong. In Germany, Professor W. Freudenberg claims to have found a ceramic object in the early diluvial of Luetzelsachsen near Weinheim, and he defends the geological age of this supposedly oldest ceramic in the world. It cannot be doubted that a very deep frost fissure once reached as far as the early diluvial layer and that the funnel-shaped clay object fell from the upper Neolithic strata to the bottom of the fissure, to be enclosed later by subse- quent falls of parts of the early diluvial strata. Now let us return once more to France. The telegram is famous which Count Begouen dispatched in October, 1912, to Emile Cartailhac, when he discovered his clay bison in the cavern Tuc d'Audoubert in the Pyrenees: "Les Magdaleniens modelaient aussi l'argile." Since then, Norbert Casteret found statues and bas-reliefs in the Gautier-Montespan cav- ern; later Felix Trombe made similar discoveries in a different gallery of the same cave. In 1930 Jauze and Mandement discovered new objects of modelled clay in the Bedeilhac cave. Here we have artistic ceramics of the Upper Palaeolithic as a universal feature of the Mag- dalenian period in the Pyrenees. In Dolni Vestonice we have a universal ceramic art of the Aurignacian period. I am convinced that ceramics, especially artistic objects, will be dis- covered in other Upper Palaeolithic stations. It is certain that some were found in Kosti- enky in the Ukraine. P. P. Efimenko mentions "products of firm, blueish clay." At the Twelfth French Prehistoric Congress in Toulouse, the B6gouens, father and son, showed a small Magdalenian animal statuette which was certainly modelled of clay. It came from the Trois Freres cave, which is becoming of prime importance due to its innumerable wall drawings, which Abbe Breuil is laboriously deciphering at present. I could find no difference between that statuette and the statuette discovered in Dolni Vestonice. From Moravian and Pyrenaic ceramic objects we have proved the assumption that the origin of ceramics is to be found in the Upper Palaeolithic period. It must be observed, how- ever, that these are artistic objects and not vessels. The latter appear to have been a spon- taneous discovery of the Neolithic period. Even under the most favorable conditions frag- ments of pottery can be found only rarely and sporadically, and statements such as those concerning the discoveries in the Spy cave must be examined rigorously. From the anthropological point of view the discovery in the second year of our excava- tions in Dolni Vkstonice of a larger anthropomorphic ceramic Venus statuette was particu- larly important. In another article we shall deal critically, on a comparative basis, with the interesting theme of diluvial portrayals of women, using new material and new angles.
