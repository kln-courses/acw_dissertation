<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC LACONIA: PART II (PLATES 18-29) THIS paper covers the remaining districts of Laconia which have not been described in the last Annual, as well as the islands of Kythera and Antikythera. We include a Chronological Table, Distribution Maps, and a short summary. Abbreviations used are the same as for Part I. WESTERN VARDHOUNIA AND SOUTHERN MANI GYTHION AND CRANAE So far no prehistoric remains have been discovered on the acropolis at Gythion,' although the south and east terraces are covered with classical and Roman pottery. On the island of Cranae, however (PLATE I8a), obsidian is plentiful,2 and recently a considerable quantity of L.H. III sherds (of rather poor quality) has been found.3 The island measures about 300 metres east to west and Ioo metres north to south, and the prehistoric settlement seems to have occupied about half of this area. There is now very little depth of soil, except in the vicinity of the small Turkish fort in the centre (PLATE I8a). The amount of Mycenaean pottery indicates a fairly important site, such as the Homeric story of the flight of Paris and Helen from here might lead us to expect (II. iii. 443-6). It is likely that there was also some E.H. occupation, since some of the coarse ware appears to be handmade. KOUTOUMOU AND ANCIENT AEGIAE At the site of classical Aegiae,4 between Koutoumou and Limni, a two-day search failed to reveal any prehistoric settlement, and it seems possible that there was no inland penetration into this area in the Bronze Age. The earliest finds from the area are Archaic terracottas and bronzes found by peasants (see Appendix, p. 175, FIG. 27). The three 'Tombs of Kings's on the right of the Gythion-Sparta road at Koutoumou may be prehistoric, but a Hellenistic or Roman date is more likely. The south side of the 'Tomb' nearest the road has recently been cut away by a bulldozer, revealing the artificial layers of the mound (PLATE I8b and FIG. I).6 MAVROVOUNI Between the hill of Kumaro7 above Gythion and the alluvial plain of the Vardhounia River lies a belt of low sandy hills. These extend for 2 or 3 kilometres to right of the Gythion-Areopolis road and for 3 kilometres up the left bank of the river. The district is rich in vines, olives, and I BSA xiii (I9o6-7) 222.

Also two sherds from plain long-stemmed Kylikes, and the rim of an Alabastron (L.H. IIIA-B). Most of the sherds are L.H. IIIB (or very nearly IIIC).

About a kilometre to east of the River Vardhounia, at the fifth kilometre stone on the road from Gythion to Areopolis, is a prominent sandy hill to north of the road.'3 Several Mycenaean chamber tombs have been carved out of the soft rock in the upper terraces of the hill, and there are a few E.H. and L.H. III sherds on the summit. It seems unlikely, however, that the main prehistoric settlement was here; but rather on a lower hill about 300 metres to the north-east,14 where there are more sherds, covering a wider area and more evenly distributed. The latter include Mycenaean, classical, and Roman. But the former hill was undoubtedly the chief Mycenaean cemetery in the district. There are now seven Mycenaean chamber tombs visible (FIG. 3. Plans of Nos. I, 2, 3, and 5 are shown on FIG. 4; No. 3 is illustrated on PLATE I8C). In two cases (Nos. 4 and 6) L.H.

The glaze is not shiny as is normal in Laconian Proto- geometric; but cf. op. cit. 284, 'the paint . . . does not invariably have the metallic look'. 2z A length of 0-32 m. is preserved in fragments (in very bad condition) in Gythion Museum. 13 It is the southernmost of the small chain of hills which border the Vardhounia plain on the east. 14 Not very far from the site of the Protogeometric 'tomb' at Stena, described above. Two cavities in the lower NW. terraces of the hill looked very like the remains of other chamber tombs. is The sherds are L.H. IIIB, and possibly also L.H. IIIC (early). Mostly from Kylikes and Deep Bowls, usually with monochrome paint on the interior and streaky linear band decoration on the exterior. The paint is lustrous but not well applied, and the style appears provincial, as at Cranae above.</page><page sequence="5">II8 HELEN WATERHOUSE AND R. HOPE SIMPSON there are two instances (Nos. 3 and T) of blocking walls from the doors of the chambers.'6 Some tombs have been partially destroyed by terracing,I7 and it is clear that others have been either cut away or buried in the same manner. During the last war the Italians used some of the tombs as dug-outs,'8 since the hill is a useful viewpoint, commanding the whole of the Mavrovouni district, the Vardhounia plain, and the wide stretch of sandy shore to the south. Several unroofed and rectangular rock-cut tombs'I on the upper terraces of the hill appear to be Hellenistic or Roman. One, on the very top of the hill, has various small square and semi- circular niches in the side-walls, reminiscent of Roman columbaria. There are late classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds and tiles on the terraces below some of the tombs. To south of the road at the southern foot of the hill is the house of Mr. Nikolopoulos, which stands on an artificial mound some 4 metres high,20 measuring 32 metres north to south by 24 metres east to west (PLATE I 8d). A shallow trench excavated by Mr. Christou in the north side of the mound yielded no positive results, but there are obvious signs that the floor of the house lies above something hollow, and the shape of the mound and its dimension recall the 'Tombs of Kings' at Koutoumou (above), while it is not unlike the mounds above the Mycenaean tholos tombs at Kopanaki and Vasiliko in Messenia.ZI About 30 metres east of the house some walls of small stones were found at a depth of 2 to 3 metres when a well was dug. With them were E.H. and L.H. III sherds.2z LAS The site of classical Las has been securely identified with the remains on the hill of Passava and in its neighbourhood (PLATE I9a).23 But the 'polygonal'z4 masonry, which was said to rise to a height of two-thirds of the medieval castle wallzs on the east side, is in fact mostly out of its original position, and the tell-tale mortar is,26 of course, medieval. There is not sufficient evidence to enable the large blocks (some are 1.5o m. by 0o80 m.) to be attributed to the Mycenaean period, and so far the only object which could be said to be prehistoricz7 found on the hill (after a very intensive search) is a solitary chip of obsidian. Classical and Hellenistic sherds are, however, abundant. Although the site would have made a magnificent Mycenaean fortress, worthy of the name A&amp;ag (II. ii. 585), the evidence for Mycenaean occupation is still lacking. Between Las and Teuthrone no signs of prehistoric settlement have been found, al- though they might have been expected near Kamares on the bay of Giorganos,2s where there are some Roman remains,29 and near Skutari, conjectured to be the site of the Laconian Asine.30 16 The doorway of No. 3 has the remains of a fagade similar to that observed on a chamber tomb at Leuktro in Messenia described in BSA lii (1957) 234.

Lund, 1927-8, 20-39 and pl. xii. 22 E.H.: many sherds from Sauceboats and Shallow Bowls of 'yellow mottled ware' (Zygouries Class A II), very similar to those from the Helos plain (PART I). One sauceboat has zigzag decoration below the rim in added white (cf. PAE 1951, 84 and fig. 9, from Raphina in Attica). Also many fragments of horizontal handles from large jars, of a shape like Asea fig. 81 and Tiryns iv, pl. x, 4. The biscuit is thin, and the clay coarse, with fine grit added. L.H. III: mostly from monochrome painted Deep Bowls (L.H. IIIA-B). Apithos-rim resembles those from Asteri and Karneas illustrated in PART I. 23 BSA xiii. 232-4. 24 Op. cit. 232. Better described as 'ashlar', BSA xii (I905-6) 275. 2s Op. cit. 274-5, pl. iii and fig. 3. 26 BSA xiii. 232. 27 On closer inspection the 'L.H. III sherds' mentioned in BSA li (1956) 170 prove to be enigmatic. 28 The headland of Ageranos, a short distance to the north, is probably the ancient Arainos, where the tomb of Las was said to be (Paus. iii. 24. IO). 29 BSA xiii. 234. 30 Op. cit. 235.</page><page sequence="6">PREHISTORIC LACONIA: PART II 119 KOTRONES (TEUTHRONE) The promontory of Skopa at Kotrones is undoubtedly the site of ancient Teuthrone (Paus. iii. 21. 7 and 25. 4), as is indicated by the Hellenistic and Roman remains here.3I The pro- montory is about 20 metres above sea at its highest point, and measures about 300 metres north to south by 150 metres east to west. It is now joined to the mainland by a strip of shingle 20 metres long, apparently once a wider causeway. Obsidian is abundant over the whole pro- montory, especially on the south, where the cliffs are steeper. E.H. occupation is attested by some coarse pottery;32 and the remains of two pithos burials,33 revealed by erosion, on the north- east side, 15 metres to east of the shingle strip, may be M.H. or L.H. Several fragments from celts and querns and coarse, mostly handmade, pottery show that the site was well populated in the Bronze Age. Mycenaean occupation is likely, but not proved.34 Late classical black- glazed sherds and Samian or Pergamene ware of the Roman period are common. The remains of a bath building to north-west of the shingle spit must be the same as those described by Woodward3s as of a 'brick hypocaust'. The visible part of the building is the corner of afrigi- darium.36 Ancient sherds are abundant in the vicinity and for at least 200 metres inland. THE ANTICO ROSSO QUARRIES NEAR LAGIA Antico Rosso is a hard marble, whose colour varies from deep pink to purplish brown. It is close-grained, and consequently of considerable weight. It was valued in antiquity as a decora- tive stone which could be mined in large blocks and would stand wear and weathering.37 The ancient quarries of Antico Rosso (or 'Taenarian Marble')38 lie about 3 kilometres north-west of Lagia and 21 kilometres inland to west of Kyprianon (FIG. 5, marked as 'Ay. Ilias'; PLATE I9b). They show as purple scars on the eastern spurs of the steep hills above the hamlets of Dhimaristika and Prophetes Ilias. The deposits are rich and extensive. The Italian 'Marmor' company opened up a quarry here before the First World War, and built a road from the harbour of Kyprianon.39 On the west slope of the hill of Spira (PLATE 19c, FIG. 5), near Kyprianon, in the olive groves below a farm, were fragments of Bronze Age coarse pottery, some of which are probably L.H.,40 and a sherd of classical black-glazed. This hill, with its fertile dark soil, is conspicuous amid the relatively barren countryside round about; and it dominates the little harbour of Kyprianon, with its small but sheltered shingle beach. The countryside would not have been very attractive to settlers, and it is reasonable to suppose that the small Bronze Age and classical settlements at Spira owed their existence to the demand for Antico Rosso. On a small hillock4I 400 metres east of the chapel of Prophetes Ilias, only a few metres from one of the ancient mines, were a few scattered sherds, among which were two from black-glazed kylikes of the fifth or fourth 31 BSA xiii. 256-7. 32 'E.H. II' rims of a gritty and micaceous fabric, similar to Eutresis fig. I46, 5, and Asea fig. 82 g. 33 The profiles of the bases are visible as dark streaks in the soil, but the tops have been crushed in. Fragments of bones and pottery are visible within the pithos sections. 34 Burr, Die Tontafeln von Pylos und der homerische Schiffs- katalog (1958) 73, conjectures that te-te-ra-ne in An 12(I) is Teuthrone (cf. Documents 185-6). But this seems a little far from the scene of operations. 35 BSA xiii. 256-7. 36 The floor is of white plaster, and the lower part of the walls is lined with white marble. The walls themselves are entirely made of tile courses with cement bonding. 37 A geological note is given by Philippson, Der Peloponnes i. 225. 38 Strabo viii. 367; cf. Pliny, NHxxxvi. I8 (29ag).

The road shows as a white scar in the middle distance on PLATE I9b, running left to right. 40 One sherd with a cable pattern is from a pithos of the same micaceous fabric as found at Mavrovouni (above), and other Laconian sites. Other sherds are of gritty fabric similar to those from Teuthrone (above) and Elaphonisi (below). 41 The site is marked 'Classical Site' on FIG. 5. The quarry is visible near the extreme right of PLATE 19b in the middle distance, a little to right of the chapel.</page><page sequence="7">THE ANTICO ROSSO QUARRIES Ialis Ay.

To west of the quarries, near the track to Gerolimena, were some Roman sherds. These may indicate an ancient route for conveying the stone to the city of Caenepolis near Taenaron.42 The chief evidence for the use of Antico Rosso in the Bronze Age are the fragments of spiral-band and triglyph friezes from the fagade of the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae,43 but there is also a lamp made of the stone from the Vaphio Tomb,44 and many of the objects from Crete which are classed as 'purple gypsum' or the like are probably Antico Rosso.4s There are also two fine fragments of rhytons from Mycenae46 and Asine.47 In default of evidence for other ancient quarries of the stone in Greece,48 and in view of the evidence for the working of the Lagia mines in antiquity, we may assume as a hypothesis for the time being that these were the main source of Antico Rosso in the Mycenaean and classical periods as well as in Roman times.49 OITYLOS The village of Oitylos (PLATE 1I9d), with its harbour at Limeni,so occupies a strategic point, well suited to command both the north-south route along the west coast of Mani, and also the western end of the pass from Gythion to Areopolis.s' There is no doubt that the classical and later Oetyluss52 lay on the seaward slopes of the hill of Oitylos,sa and that its acropolis lay on the summit.s4 The slopes are covered with classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds, and a few fragments of coarse ware may be prehistoric. Despite the lack of definite proof as yet, the nature of the site, its situation, and the combination of the literary evidence and the con- tinuity of the name (Vitylo during the Turkish occupation) are strong arguments that the Homeric OTirAos (II. ii. 585) lay on the same site as the classical acropolis and the modern village. 42 BSA xiii. 245-6. 43 BSA xxv. 342-6; Wace, Mycenae 29-31, figs. 49-50; BMCat (1927) 14-3I (esp. figs. 22 and 24); Bossert, AltKreta (x923), nos. 204 a and b, 205 a.

But there is so far no evidence of the mining of Antico Rosso there in antiquity. 49 There are several objects of Antico Rosso listed in the Sparta Museum Catalogue (SMC Index p. 216, s.v. 'Rosso Antico'). Particularly interesting are reliefs of the Dioscuri, nos. I4b, 29I, 467, and 58I. Most of the objects are of the Ist cent. B.C. and Ist cent. A.D.; no. 28 is said to be of the 2nd cent. B.C. For the Roman working of the quarries we have the authority of Strabo (viii. 367). There are also many worked and unworked fragments of the stone in the Tainaron district. In Kitta thin slabs were used to cover a Roman grave (seen in 1956), and there are several pieces at Caenepolis and in the region of Kouno (where Roman coins were found, BSA xiii. 244-5). so The Mediterranean Pilot (iii (1919) 66) calls it 'the best natural port in the Gulf of Kalamata'. s5 BSA xiii. 239.

HOPE SIMPSON MEZZAPO AND THE CASTLE OF MAINA The Castle of Maina,ss on the end of the promontory of Tigani (PLATE 20a, FIG. 6),56 south of the village of Mezzapo, has been conjectured to be the site of Homeric Mioar (II. ii. 582).s57 One might suppose that this barren and waterless5s headland would been have rather unsuitable as a habitation site; but there is no doubt that it makes an excellent fortress, walls being necessary on the landward side alone. The medieval walls (marked r on FIG. 6) are built on the cliffs of the highest section. They had an outer facing of mortar. In the towers (A, B, and C on FIG. 6), especially at the base of the tower at the south angle (tower B on PLATE 20C), there are some large blocks of roughly squared stone which may be ancient, and others in the remnant of walling near the rock-cut steps on the east; but the most important evidence comes from the cross wall on the south-west (marked p on FIG. 6). This is definitely ancient. It is prior to the (Frankish ?) outer curved rubble wall (marked q on FIG. 6) which has been built against it on the south. Towards its western end, where it is reasonably well preserved (particularly near Tower E in PLATE 20b and FIG. 6),59 wall p can be seen to be constructed of two lines of roughly dressed blocks with a filling of smaller stones between. The thickness of the wall is here 2 metres or more. The projecting towers and the walls6o in their vicinity have an outer facing of fairly large rough limestone blocks, the largest about 1I2o x o070 m., with small stones in the interstices; and they TIGAN1 .

In view of this evidence, it is a pity that it has so far proved impossible to discover any unquestionably ancient potsherds on the surface.62 ss Built in I248 by William II de Villehardouin, the fourth Frankish prince of the Morea. s6 The name Tigani ('frying pan') is extremely appropriate. The promontory shields the deep bay of Mezzapo from south and south-west winds, rendering it a tolerable anchor- age. On the neck of the promontory are some medieval salt- pans laid on the flat rock (constructed in a grid, with tiny partition walls about Io cm. high and cemented floors). s57 Cf. BSA xiii. 243. ss The Franks relied on the numerous cisterns which they built on the summit. But an excellent spring rises near the revma at the root of the headland. s9 Tower D is not so well preserved. It cannot now be determined whether or not the gap to the east of it is ancient. 60 The walls have undergone repair (Frankish?), and only the lower courses retain the ancient stonework in position. 6i Cf. the walls of Geraki in PART I. The stonework does not seem careful enough to be of classical or Hellenistic work- manship. It is certainly not Frankish since (in contrast to wall r) wall p contains no mortar. It is not, in any case, connected with the Kastro. If the wall is Mycenaean, it could be compared with the walls of Gla in Boeotia. 62 This is due to the intense weathering here. There is a certain amount of rough medieval pottery visible, of a coarse fabric, with flecks of white grit, and also a tantalizing class of softer reddish fabric which is almost certainly far older.</page><page sequence="10">PREHISTORIC LACONIA: PART II 123 About a kilometre to south-east of the Maniote farm at the head of the Tigani peninsula, and near the shore of the Bay of Mezzapo, are some small caves. To south of these are extensive quarries of poros limestone, and leading to them from the east are narrow rock-cut water channels. Near the quarries are traces of an ancient road63 (from Mezzapo to Kipoula ?), and there are classical sherds in the fields around. These remains support Woodward's conjecture that classical Messa was in this region;64 and, together with the evidence from Tigani and the apparent continuity of the name Messa,6s form a strong argument, backed by literary tradition (Paus. iii. 25. Io), for the location of Homeric M1car in this vicinity, and probably at Tigani. KIPOULA On the ridge above the cliffs of the Thyrides (PLATE 20d, rFIG. 7), on the site of the later Hippola,66 there was apparently a small prehistoric settlement, of the Late Helladic period and possibly earlier.67 On the highest point of the ridge, called '-rTi cOpcaiacS r6 K&amp;cOTpO',68 no remains earlier than medieval were found, and the hill is conspicuously barren. The shrine of Athena Hippolais (Paus. iii. 25. 9) should probably be looked for on the lower northern part of the ridge, where the prehistoric and classical pottery was found.69 This area could have been made into a fort by the addition of a cross-wall on the south, since the ridge is steep on the other sides, and quite inaccessible from seaward. The well-watered plateau below on the east contains the least barren soil in the southern Mani peninsula.7o Apart from the modern tradition associating Helen with the site, the constant din created by the 'pigeons and seafowl'7I in the cliffs of the Thyrides below (which also face Tigani) is strongly suggestive of the Homeric epithet rroAirpipcova (II. ii. 582), and lends further support to the location of Homeric Mcrarj in this district. TAINARON A visit (in July 1960) to Porto ton Asomaton,72 the ancient Tainaron, confirmed Woodward's observations73 on the site of the Temple and Cave74 of Poseidon in the ravine to east of the chapel of the Asomatoi. To judge by the dimensions of the rock cutting, which is all that now remains of what is assumed to have been the Temple,75 Bursian's measurements (19 X 16 metres) are substantially correct.76 The blocks built into the north wall of the ruined chapel 63 Three shallow steps have been cut in the rock at a point where the road turns to ascend a steep gradient. Holes have been cut here in the sides of the steps, presumably to house the ends of stakes which secured the gravel surface of the road. 64 BSA loc. cit. 65 To the parallels Woodward mentions (loc. cit.), viz.

Exact details of both temples would indeed be welcome!</page><page sequence="12">PREHISTORIC LACONIA: PART II 125 NORTH-WEST MANI AND EAST TAYGETUS The west coast from Oitylos up to Kalamata has already been discussed in the Annual." It now remains to describe the sites on the north-east and east flanks of Taygetus. BELMINA Loringso established that Belmina, the frontier town between Arcadia and Laconia, was situated on the summit and flanks of Mt. Chelmos. The mountain (PLATE 2I a) overlooks the whole of the Upper Eurotas valley and completely commands the route into Laconia. The remains on its summit are considerable; the outer ring of fortifications is medieval, the inner almost certainly (as Loring judged)"' 'of classical times' (perhaps Hellenistic). There are no traces of earlier walls. Half-way up on the south-west side is a level terrace, fairly extensive, where there were a few obsidian chips and early-looking sherds. On a south slope farther down is a small plateau called Kanalaki, about 150 x 120 metres in extent, where a small vine planta- tion produced several classical sherds8z and a few Mycenaean, together with more obsidian. About 200 metres to the east is the small ruined chapel of Ayios Nikolaos, beside which lay part of a small Doric capital in grey limestone (perhaps late fifth century B.c.), and fragments of white marble columns. Ten minutes' walk to the west of Kanalaki (keeping to the lower slope of Chelmos) at a place named Iannakas some dry stream beds run through an area of slaty stone. Remains of pithos-burials have been revealed here by erosion in the loose soil of the stream banks, together with some fragments of poor quality L.H. Kylikes and Deep Bowls. Less than a kilometre to the north-west is one of the chief mainsprings of the Eurotas. The prehistoric finds, although not numerous, indicate that, as would be expected, this strategic site, in one of the best-watered regions of Laconia (Paus. iii. 2 I1. 3), was not overlooked by the Mycenaeans; and it was perhaps occupied in still earlier times.83 PELLANES A hundred stades nearer Sparta was the town of Pellana, traditionally connected with Tyndareus.84 A local legend still relates how Tyndareus came to Pellana, married the king's daughter, and afterwards became king of Sparta. The site of Pellana is undoubtedly at Kalyvia- Pellanes (the Kalyvia of Georghitsi, now called Kastania), and it was surely centred on the hill of Palaiokastro, where there are remains of a small medieval fort (PLATE 2 Ib and FIG. 8a). Loring noticed traces of 'probable Hellenic work'8ss in the medieval walls, and there are several fragments of classical black-glazed pottery on the hill. Trial excavations were made here by Karachalios, but he never published full details. He found a small black-painted trefoil-lipped oenochoe and an iron spearhead. Surface finds made in 1937 and 1957 included obsidian, a worked flint with serrated edge, and two fragments from L.H. III Kylikes. One or two pieces of handmade pottery may be E.H. Five minutes' walk to north of Palaiokastro, to west of the track, are two finely constructed chamber tombs dug into the soft rock of a small hillock named Spilies. Their unusual beehive shape (FIG. 8) suggests that they are imitations of tholos tombs, and it is possible that the squarely 79 BSA lii (I957) 231-59; additional details in AJA 65 (1961) 221 ff. 80so JHS xv (I895) 36-41 and 71-74. 8t Op. cit. 74. They are certainly not Mycenaean, as Dorpfeld had thought. 82 A kilometre to the south, in the eroded cliffs of the west bank of the Eurotas, are some remains of house-walls of small stones accompanied by classical black-glazed pottery. 83 Some of the coarser sherds could belong to E.H.; while the pithos burials must be M.H., if they are not Mycenaean. 84 Paus. iii. 21. 3 and cf.

IIIA,93 and another alabastron with a lattice pattern on the shoulder zone also seems L.H. IIIA. Furumark in fact dates all the pottery L.H.

FIG. 8c There are traces of other chamber tombs on the same hill (one marked with ? on FIG. 8a),97 and on the hills to south and south-east, and there is no doubt that this is an important Mycenaean cemetery. It is almost certain that it is to be associated with a contemporary settle- ment on the hill of Palaiokastro. The site is on the edge of a fertile plain, stretching for a con- siderable distance to the south (bounded on the east by the Eurotas), while the fine spring in the middle of Pellanes village provides copious water all the year round. The wealth of the finds within the tombs amply confirms the ancient traditions concerning Pellana. The higher country above Pellanes, although well watered and abundant in trees, seems not to have been inhabited in ancient times; the road to Sparta must always have kept near the river.98 Trypi too has no ancient site, which might be an argument that the Langada pass over Taygetus was not in use in these early times. The hill country behind the outer eastern range of 89 These comprised: an electrum seal, with indecipherable design; a sealstone, not engraved; 25 beads of glass paste; about 25 spindle whorls of hard stone in varying colours; afigurine of 'phi' type (and another?); a bronze spearhead.

HOPE SIMPSON Taygetus is one of the most delightful parts of Laconia-running with streams and cool in summer, every village having its orchards and surrounded by oaks and other trees.99 The natural wealth of the district, and Herodotus' story of the Minyans in Taygetus,Ioo would both suggest early inhabitation. Further search might be successful near Anavryte, where there is a pass to Messenia,Io1 and perhaps near Socha, above the Eleusinion.1oz ARKINES There is one indubitable proof that the Mycenaeans did penetrate this high country, namely the two small and poorly constructed Mycenaean tholos tombs at Arkines,'13 in a high stony and wooded valley just south of the summit of Taygetus, at the head of the Goranoi River. The southern route over Taygetus passes over the col just above Arkines, between Ayios Ilias and Anina, and there are good reasons for believing that there was an ancient route here also.104 The village of Arkines itself no longer exists, but the name continues; and the district called 6 rrap'nrks, where some celts and also post-Mycenaean sherds were found,I0s comprises the land immediately south of the upper part of the gorge of the Goranoi River, opposite the area called Arkines, and including the hill of Gazeika, covered with scrub and small pine trees, in which the tholos-tomb excavated by Tsountas lies hidden (PLATE 2 Id, FIG. 9, A). Soteriades' tholos (B) lies a little to the south-west, on the same ridge. In an area called Yerakas there are traces (marked ? on FIG. 9) of what may have been similar, but smaller, tombs (to the north-west across the gorge),io6 and there are some coarse sherds in their vicinity. The date of Tsountas' tomb is uncertain, since there were few finds, and little chronological information can be derived from an analysis of its very rough constructionlo7 (which was dictated by local conditions), but there are slight indications that it may belong to the L.H. IIIA period.I0s The tomb excavated by Sotiriadeslo9 was said to have contained nothing. But among ddbris found round the tomb by J. F. Lazenby and R. Hope Simpson in July I96o were some very small sherds of L.H. date, of thin 'soapy' fabric, with occasional traces of monochrome(?) paint. On this same visit definite evidence was found of Mycenaean inhabitation on the slopes of the hill called Paizoulia to the east of Tsountas' Tholos, and immediately opposite. The slopes extend for about Ioo metres, down to the ravine which separates them from the tomb. Mycenaean sherds were found on the middle terraces, over an extent of approximately 200oo metres north-west to south-east by 99 Cf.

To the north, 50 metres below, is the deep gorge of the Saranda- potamos, which must here have formed part of the ancient frontier between Tegea and Laconia."' The hill is large (over 300 metres in diameter), and the classical settlement (probably ancient Iasos),IIz now partly excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society,"I is extensive. Surface finds on the hill (I957) included L.H. III kylix fragments and obsidian chips. A celt, probably E.H., was previously found."4 The Mycenaean cemetery lay on a lower hill adjoining the site on the west. The large tholos tomb (diameter of chamber 8.65 m.) excavated by Rhomaios"s somewhat resembles in con- struction the tombs of Aegisthus and Epano Phournos at Mycenae. It contained among other things some fine L.H. II 'Palace Style' vases,"6 fragments of boar's tusks from a helmet, and arrowheads of stone and bronze. Of great interest are the eight miniature Mycenaean tholos tombs (about 3 metres in diameter) discovered in 1956 and 195717 on the same hill. Finds included bronze swords, many steatite spindle whorls, three terracotta figurines, and a jasper sealstone with the design of a running bull. The figurines are presumably L.H. III, but no exact dates are given. Another small tomb was found below the hill near the Sarandapotamos river, and a cist grave below a classical building on the hill of Analipsis itself."8 The miniature tholos tombs are remarkably similar to those found on the east bank of the Sarandapotamos, about Io kilometres north of Analipsis, and 51 kilometres to south-south-east of Tegea."9 The Mycenaean site at Analipsis must have been important, since it lies on the route from Tegea to Sparta as well as at the end of the route up from Astros, and the Thyrean plain.~0 io This spring appeared of old (within living memory) at least 20 m. farther up the river bed.

KYNOURIA TYROSI24 From Astros Bay to Tyros the hills fall sheer to the sea, their barren slopes rising landward to moraines and practically unscalable cliffs. At Tyros there is a small deep bay at the southern end of which the Greek acropolis rises steeply from the sea, crowned with fairly well-preserved walls and towers (PLATE 22a). This site yielded a certain amount of E.H. pottery and a worked flint, probably an arrowhead (flint is not native to the Peloponnese).I25 The only other pottery found was black-glazed. It seems likely that the place was not inhabited during the Middle and Late Bronze Age, lying as it does well away from the main lines of immigration and com- munication. LEONIDI PLAKAI26 The plain of Leonidi, though small, is fertile and its river valley affords a route inland as far as the main ridge of Parnon. The classical town of Brasiai or Prasiai (Paus. iii. 2 I. 6; Polyb. iv. 36) lay near Leonidi Skala, on the seaward slopes of Plaka; both polygonal and ashlar walls are preservedI27 and the occupied area seems to have stretched inland nearly as far as the present- day Leonidi. Terrace walls and disturbed graves can be seen above the road near the Skala, and in this area were found obsidian, coarse Helladic pottery, and a few L.H. III sherds, notably Kylix stems (PLATE 24a, I and 4). This was presumably the site of a small port serving the Helladic settlements up the valley. VASKINA In the winter of 1936 peasant cultivators uncovered a Mycenaean tomb in the district known as Kotroni, some 40 minutes north-west of the Kalyvia of Vaskina, which is itself three hours north-west of Leonidi. Vaskina is a tiny summer Kalyvia, dependent for its water-supply on a single well; it lies high, and even by Greek standards the soil is remarkably stony. The sur- rounding country (geologically it is hard limestone) is barren and treeless, and so cut up by ravines that it seems unlikely that any traffic ever passed through it. The tomb itself lies in a small depression; it was built of fairly large field-stones (PLATE 22d), very roughly coursed, and when found was capped by a large stone slab.

PALAIOKHORI Some four hours up the valley from Leonidi is the large village of Palaiokhori. The area is well watered and fertile, and two probably very ancient routes lead past the village, one over the spine of Parnon to Tsitsina and the Eurotas valley, the other to Kosmas (where a celt has been found) and Geraki. A good deal of excavation was conducted at Paliokhori by Deffner in the first quarter of the century, and one group of vases was published,129 and is now in the National Museum, Athens (Nos. 6261-82). These were said to come from 'tombs on the property of P. Sykokis'; their dates vary, according to Furumark, from L.H. I/IIA to L.H. IIIA.130 Jars (i) Handleless, No. 6268 (MP Shape 77).

Two had been filled in; the third is very similar to the Vaskina one, oval and built of (here smallish) rough stones on the corbel principle. The coursing is rudimentary, but it was possible to count eight 'layers' of stones on the western side. The long axis runs north and south, measur- ing 2"40 m. at floor-level and I-80 m. at the top, which is some 1-50 m. from the floor and was formerly covered with large flat slabs. The width at floor-level is i-Io m., at the apex 0o-50 m. The floor is partly of stones, partly of sterile grey earth, and there are traces of an entrance at the north end. The excavators found twenty-two skeletons, but did not clear the grave completely, since on this visit it yielded, at the northern end, a black-coated Kylix (PLATE 23b) and several sherds, none earlier than L.H. IIIB.I3' The other two graves were rectangular cists; their contents had long been missing, and neither these nor their shape and construction were Mycenaean. The chief concentration of graves at Palaiokhori, however, is on the hill of MlKp1' rooiph1x to the south of the village. The most important of these is the small elliptical tholos (PLATE 23C) which is preserved up to the level of the lintels, one of which, about 2 metres long, is in place. Its long axis runs east to west. The dromos was very short and so damaged as to make it uncertain whether it had ever been lined with masonry. The doorway is I-2o m. long, with no traces of a door; it probably had three lintel blocks. The chamber measured 3"20 x 2"40 m. on the east to west and north to south axes respectively, but at a point somewhat above the true floor- level; its masonry, though rough, was coursed, the preserved height being I150 m. Only one skeleton had been found in it and there was no record of its contents, though search produced a piece of a L.H. II Alabastron at the end of the dromos. The other graves (some thirty in all, according to local record) lie on the north and south slopes of the hill, usually in groups, with more on the southern side. Five form a group with the elliptical tholos. Many are now hard to trace, but most seem to have been of the same type as the Sykokis and Vaskina tombs. Their contents, long since dissipated, are said to have included weapons. It may be considered open to doubt whether the provenance of the vases described above was in fact the Sykokis tomb. The majority were L.H. IIB, and only four are as late as L.H. IIIA; whereas the Kylix and sherds found inside at the lowest level are L.H. IIIB at the earliest. Admittedly these were by the entrance-though how this was ever approached is not yet clear- but there can have been little room in this comparatively small chamber, after twenty-two interments, for the entrance to be used at all; it is more reasonable to suppose that the later burials took place from the top, by the simple expedient of removing and replacing the cap- stone. It is quite possible that the vases were in fact found on MIKp1 Toiphac, either in several tombs, or, since they form a reasonably homogeneous group, in the tholos, for which a L.H. II date would be perfectly acceptable. The only other elliptical tholoi known are the two at Thorikos,32az the pottery from which is L.H. IIA. The Palaiokhori tholos resembles the larger of these both in the quality of its masonry and in plan, with dromos, doorway, and chamber all in the same long axis (the smaller Thorikos tomb'33 has the dromos on the short axis). The smaller Palaiokhori and Vaskina tombs have as yet no parallels. Their type seems to be derived from the tholos proper, with corbel vault and cap-stone, and an entrance, but no doorway or dromos, at floor-level. Perhaps they were '3' Angular Kylix with one handle, now in the National Museum, Athens (PLATE 23b). H. o I05 m., d. of rim o2 I2 m., of foot o-o6 m. Coated all over with dull black. Cf.

Some special connexion with Attica, dating at least from the L.H. II period, must be assumed. Herodotus' remark (viii. 73) about the Ionian race of the 'autochthonous' Kynourians of his day may reflect some ancient relationship with the Ionians of Attica. In view of the position of Vaskina-which cannot be dissociated from Palaiokhori-it is likely that the L.H. people of the district came by sea,'34 not over Parnon, and they may well have come from Attica. It is improbable that the Thorikos people came from Kynouria in view of the flourishing M.H. settlement on that acropolis.'3s The site of the Helladic settlement was the hill of Kotroni (PLATE 22b), a rocky hill with flattish top and terraced slopes on the north-eastern outskirts of the village. The summit has been badly eroded, and the lower slopes are considerably built over, so that surface finds were few and no walls could be traced. The owner of the land on the south-east slope had collected a dozen or so celts, the majority of a common type with broad working and narrow blunt end,'36 and part of the perforated base of a cooking pot.'37 The sherds found were predominantly Early Helladic's8 (PLATE 24a, 3, 5, 6, and 7), notably 'finger-marked' ring bases from coarse pots; one pithos fragment'39 (PLATE 24a, 2) may be M.H., and a few worn scraps appear to be L.H. In spite of the paucity of L.H. surface finds there can be little doubt that the town to which the tombs on M1Kp9i Tolphcx belonged was situated on Kotroni. LYMBIADAI40 About three-quarters of an hour west-north-west from Palaiokhori in the direction of Ayios Vasilios are ruins which some have supposed to be those of Glyppia or GlimpeisI4I and a decayed monastery, the Palaiopanagia. The Hellenic fort lies on a rocky knoll on a gentle slope between two streams (still running in June), and the ground between it and the monastery is covered in sherds, mostly of black-glazed ware. A hand-made E.H. ring base, of the same micaceous clay as those from Kotroni, and the handle of a L.H. III jug, with other more shapeless pieces, confirm the existence of a small Bronze Age settlement in this eminently habitable place. KOSMAS (? Glyppia) The small summit of the hill of Prophetes Ilias, which stands above the village on the west, is now only sparsely covered with classical sherds.14z Prehistoric occupation in the district is suggested by the discovery of a celt here, and there is a large rectangular lump of Lapis Lacedaemonius from the site in the B.S.A. collection at Athens (measurements 0-o9 m. by o'o7 m. by o0o65 m.). Kosmas lies on the direct route from Geraki (Geronthrae) to Leonidi (Prasiae), commanding the best and most important pass over Parnon. '34 Present-day Kynouria has far closer and easier con- nexions with Athens and Nauplia than with any part of Laconia. The only close parallel to the jar from Vaskina (No. 4 above) was found at Pikermi in Attica and is de- scribed by Stubbings as unique.

HOPE SIMPSON MARI (ancient Marios) The high fortress of Kastelli to south of Mari'~43 may not have been occupied in the prehistoric period. Prolonged search of this acropolis and its slopes failed to reveal any sherds earlier than classical (fifth- and fourth-century B.c. black glazed are abundant). The rough wallsI44 at first sight look early, but they are certainly not 'Cyclopean'. In particular, there are few stones used in interstices, although some smaller stones are occasionally laid in an attempt to make the courses even. The size of the stones seldom exceeds 0o80 x 0o60 m. The impression is of very provincial work of late Archaic or early classical date. In the fertile little valley of the river of Mari between the acropolis and the village, black-glazed sherds and tiles are common, and the main part of the ancient town of Marios may have been here rather than on the rather barren slopes of the fortress site. There are fine springs on the slopes above the village (north-north-west of the acropolis), and it is surely in this area that we should expect to find the shrine of Artemis and Pausanias' Pantheon.I45 Inland, the southern part of Kynouria does not seem to have been occupied in prehistoric times.'46 But Kyparissi (ancient Kyphanta) and Ieraka (ancient Zarax) on the coast might produce evidence of Mycenaean settlement.'~47 THE MALEA PENINSULA EPIDAURUS LIMERA Several Mycenaean chamber tombs (some with stepped dromoi) have recently been excavated to south-west of the acropolis of Epidaurus Limera (PLATE 25a, FIG. IO), in the neighbourhood of Ayia Triadha, and also farther west, near the village of Ayios Ioannis.'48 In the sides of the ravine of Ayia Triadha are the remains of several other robbed and partially destroyed tombs. The pottery from the excavated tombs ranges from L.H. I to L.H. IIIC (including Close Style). Surface exploration in 1957 on the classical acropolis'I49 established, as might have been expected, that the Mycenaean centre was here also.Iso A sherd in the B.S.A. collection at Athens marked 'Epidaurus Limera' (FIG. 15, I) is almost certainly Neolithic."sI The position of the site is ideal, since it commands a wide stretch of the coastline, and lies at the eastern end of the easiest route from Sparta to the east coast.52sz It is likely that there was once an important Mycenaean fortress on the summit.

I73) that 'in spite of the varieties of masonry used, there is no reason to attribute a pre-hellenic origin to the ruins of Zarax'. This remark is almost certainly correct as applied to the existing remains of walling. It is regretted that we were not able to visit these relatively inaccessible sites. 148 The tombs are marked on FIG. Io. They were excavated by Mr. Christou and Mr. Oikonomakos.

They are also briefly described by Oikonomakos, in 'ApXaia 'Eirf8avpo Alanrlpa (1957). '49 The classical and later remains are described in BSA xiv. 179-82.

Minoa is usually equated with Monemvasia, and the name is suggestive of prehistoric occupation. Professor Blegen is reported to have said that he found L.H. sherds near the old village,'s3 which is the only habitable site. The summit itself is barren and waterless.I54 To the south of Monemvasia along the east coast no certain evidence of prehistoric occupa- tion was found; although the sites of Epidelium (Voutama)'55 and the probable site of the Temple of Artemis Limnatis (Limnes)'56 seemed promising.

HOPE SIMPSON ANGELONA On the north-east extremity of the plateau of Kollyri near Angelona, about 150 metres north of the site of the British School's excavations,'s8 is a small rocky hill (PLATE 25C), oval in shape, about 80 metres east to west and 45 metres north to south, covered in loose stone and scrub. To north and east it overlooks the deep ravine Ioo metres below, which runs down to Epidaurus Limera. On the south and west it is connected to the Kollyri plateau, and the gentle slopes here are covered in coarse Bronze Age sherds and obsidian. E.H.Iss coarse wares were recog- nizable, and some wheel-made pottery of rough micaceous fabric is probably L.H. The site of the HeroonI6o must have been on the lower slopes of the plateau or near the spring on the south side of the path from Angelona to Ayios Ioannis nearby. There are no classical sherds on the hill site itself or on its southern slopes. ANEMOMYLO, near SIKEA On a gentle rise, about 300 metres north-east of the road from Sikea to Molaoi, and I1 kilometres from Sikea, there is a ruined round tower, once a windmill (Anemomylo, PLATE 25d). In the vicinity is a fair quantity of coarse pottery, of the same varieties as at Angelona, including E.H. and L.H. III,I61 and over forty fragments of obsidian. KATAVOTHRA Mr. Oikonomakos recorded a local report of the discovery of Mycenaean pottery in the cemetery of the village of Katavothra, where part of the drapery of a female statue (Hellenistic ?) had been found.'6z But surface exploration in 1958 was unrewarded. MOLAOI There was no prehistoric site here, although an obsidian core was found in the gorge to the west above the town, near the small medieval fort.'63 The 'medieval refuge castle' of Palaio- kastro on the southern peak of Mt. Kourkoula is considered locally to be the ancient Cory- phasium.'64 The walls enclose an area of 150 by 50 metres, and below the medieval (or later ?) walls on the south side is a stretch of ancient walling, constructed of large stones with smaller stones in the interstices. Some black-glazed sherds were found within the walls. There is a magnificent view from the site over a wide stretch of the coastline, and it is well situated to control the old high road over Kourkoula from the Helos plain to the plain of Molaoi.I6s KOKKINIA The hamlet is named after the red cliffs on the north. The area of the classical town (Acriae),I66 as marked by the spread of potsherds, is about i kilometre north to south by 250 metres east to west.

GANGANIA Below the monastery of Gangania, one hour north of Molaoi along the road to Apidia, rises a rocky hill (PLATE 26a), precipitous on its eastern side, in shape reminiscent of the acropolis of Mycenae, and commanding the approach to the fertile Molaoi plain. Its foot is enclosed on two sides by a stream which, although not perennial, runs freely at least until midsummer. Sherds are plentiful on the upper slopes; and in several places large stones look very like wall foundations. E.H., M.H., and L.H. sherds were collected, and half of a small celt of greenish stone, probably L.H. III (PLATE 24b, 9). One M.H. sherd (PLATE 24b, 4)I69 is of the same light- on-dark ware as noted at Skala (see PART I). The L.H. III pottery was very shattered and the only recognizable shape was the standard L.H. IIIB Bowl. Half-way up the hill on the west two derelict and plundered chamber tombs were noted in I957. ELEA On the upper east slopes of the steep hill south of Elea (PLATE 26b, FIG. I I), which is crowned by a medieval tower,'70 were E.H. and L.H. sherds'7I and several fragments of obsidian. The hill is rocky and steep on all sides, especially to seaward; so that it is an ideal site for a small Mycenaean fortified village. About a kilometre south of Elea, on the track to Kondevianika, a large quantity of pottery, including classical and Roman, has been revealed by erosion, and the surface of fields over a radius of 300 metres is covered with sherds. These finds support the conjectureI7z that the town of Biandina, mentioned by Ptolemy (iii. 16. 9), is to be located here. Further classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds came to light about 1i kilometres north of Elea, on the way to Kokkinia, and Roman tombs have recently been found at Elea.'73 GOULAs (Plitra) The small acropolis called Goulas (PLATE 26C) lies nearly 2 kilometres north-west of Plitra (ancient Asopus),'74 at the root of the promontory of Xyli. The hill was occupied in the Neolithic period and throughout the Bronze Age. It is a natural stronghold, since its flat summit (about I8o metres north to south by Ioo metres east to west) is surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs of white sandstone, so that little walling would have been required for defence. On the north-east slope are rock-cut steps and cuttings for a roadway, below some small caves, and on the north-west and south-west slopes are two large hemispherical holes bored into the rock (diameters 0.33 m. and 0.32 m.), which are difficult to account for. On the summit are various remains of the foundations of small rectangular buildings. 168 Thick walls of small stones with tile and cement bonding courses. There was a tile relieving arch supporting the foundations at a weak point. Beside the ruin were two column bases, Roman amphora fragments, and a coin of Marcus Aurelius. 169 Three curving lines in purplish red can be made out on the black; it is hand-made and coarse, and comes from a closed shape.

AYIA TRIADHA This is the name of a small hamlet about 500 metres south of Megali Spilia and north-east of the chapel of Ayios Andreas. A well had recently been dug (in 1956) and in the side was 'the entrance to a cave lined with stones'. The 'cave' had made the sides of the well unsafe, and digging was therefore abandoned. Pottery from the excavated earth included thin micaceous wheel-made coarse ware of the kind found at Asteri, Mavrovouni, and many other Late Bronze Age sites in Laconia. AYIOS ANDREAS Near the caves south and east of the chapel were coarse Bronze Age sherds and obsidian chips. ELAPHONISI AND THE MAINLAND OPPOSITE In the time of Pausanias (iii. 22. Io) Elaphonisi was joined to the mainland. In 1677 the island was already separated from the mainland, but the strait was easily fordable;201 whereas there is now over a fathom of water.z02 On both shores the soil is light and sandy, and of little depth above the soft limestone. The same conditions obtain on the upper plateaux to south of Elaphonisi village, and over much of the rest of the island, as well as to the north-west of Latomion on the mainland opposite. The prehistoric sites are much eroded, and the ground is no longer under cultivation. The President of Elaphonisi village said in 1956 that the population of the island was rather less than 300. There are no springs, and the people rely on a few deep wells. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. They were originally pur- chased by Sir Arthur Evans.

Leake thought that traces of Hellenic foundations 500 metres from the shore 'towards the western end of the strait' were those of the temple of Athena mentioned by Pausanias as having 'no image or roof' (iii. 22. io) and that the 'pyramid' was the Tomb of Cinadus, the pilot of Menelaus.205 In a sandbank near the south tip of the salt lake described by Leakezo6 is a circular chamber cut in the rock, with sides preserved to a height of o'.75 m. The chamber is 1I50 m. in diameter, with an entrance about o.75 m. wide. This may be one of the 'several ancient sepulchres hewn in the rock and nearly filled with sand', which Leake recorded. In this area, and in fact over the whole of the sandy shore as far as Latomion, obsidian chips and Bronze Age sherds are abundant, as they are also on the other side of the Strait near Elaphonisi village. RAISI Over a kilometre to north-west of Latomion, on the plateau overlooking the coastal strip, and separated from the Latomion cliffs by a small re-entrant, there are signs of scattered Bronze Age settlement.

Veigla Two kilometres south-west of Elaphonisi village, on a plateau I1 kilometres from the west coast, there is a farmhouse and a remarkable cave, with a low vault-like roof. It is now used for storing hay. Four hundred metres to east-south-east of this is a heap of large stones on a prominent spur overlooking the Elaphonisi Strait and the mainland opposite. It is here that local tradition places the Sanctuary of Athena (Paus. iii. 22. Io). The heap of stones measures about 20 by Io metres, and some of them are roughly squared; but there are no ancient sherds here, and some 'modern' pottery suggests that this may be only the ruin of another farmhouse. Between the cave and the ruin is another typical E.H. site on a small eroded plateau, with much obsidian and pottery similar to that of Sites B and D. ELAPHONISI: SUMMARY The prehistoric sites seem to follow the pattern of the modern hamlets. The chief sites are near the sea, on sandy soil, or on terraces with little depth of earth. The main E.H. concentra- tion is around Elaphonisi village and the shore of the mainland opposite. The sites in the south and south-west are smaller and less important. The recognizable sherds belong to the 'E.H. II' class, notably rims of Bowls, of gritty and micaceous fabric, with thickened horizontal and rolled rims, below which are often bands of applied or incised decoration. There seem to be some Sauceboat bases and handles of large Jars. The finer wares are lacking. It is probable that most of the obsidian belongs to the E.H. period. Obsidian must have been especially necessary on the island for making hunting and fishing implements, since the agricultural resources of the island are poor, although the light sandy soil and its shallow depth would have rendered cultivation easy (on a rotation system?) for a primitive society. In the Late Helladic period there seem to have been fewer sites. The only certain site (at Panagia) is on the best piece of farming land. It is likely that there was also sporadic L.H. occupation of the hill country between Elaphonisi village and Phoutianika (on sites B, C, and D), and there may have been Mycenaean tombs in the sand dunes on the mainland opposite Elaphonisi. The L.H. pottery is in general of poor quality, resembling that found at Neapolis, Stena, and Ayia Triadha. This area must always have been rather cut off from the main centres and consequently of lesser importance. Yet, although the 'tomb of Cinadus' and the 'temple of Athena' have not yet been found, it is seen that there is some truth behind the ancient tradi- tions.213 KYTHERA Sir Arthur Evans remarked that the island of Kytherazl4 'may be regarded as a stepping- stone between Crete and the Peloponnesian mainland'.21s That this was certainly true of the 213 Paus. iii. 22.

I) at Kastri (and Palaiopolis),2I6 and of ancient Kythera on the mountain Palaiokastro, are correct, despite certain views to the contrary.217 The remaining prehistoric and classical sites in the island are much less important, as should be expected from a comparison of the fertility of the Palaiopolis- Palaiokastro district with the poverty of the soil in the rest of the island; and the literary evidence is wholly concerned with the town of Kythera, with its famous temple of Aphrodite (Hdt. i. io5; Paus. iii. 23. I) and the port of Skandeia. A short survey of Kythera was carried out in 1957-8, in two periods of about a week eachzl7a. Prehistoric sites are described here from north to south, followed by a summary, and some notes on later sites and on the contents of the small museum at Khora. PYREATIDES About 2 kilometres north of Karavas, to left of the track which leads to the lighthouse on the north point of the island (the ancient Rca-ravto-ro0s, Paus. iii. 23. I), at a place named Pyreatides, there are caves in the white limestone rock, and outside them E.H.zI8 sherds and obsidian chips. More obsidian and coarse sherds are to be seen to left of the track, about a kilometre farther on towards the lighthouse. The country is rocky and barren, and much resembles the terrain of Elaphonisi. There may have been scattered E.H. settlement here (and possibly also L.H.), but the position is isolated, and the land very poor. VITHOULAS A small acropolis (FIG. 16, crosses marking the distribution of ancient pottery), in rather bare hilly country (c. 150 metres above sea-level) overlooking the modern harbour of Agia Pelagia about 600 metres to the north-east. There were some E.H.2I9 sherds, similar to those at Pyreatides, and a spindle whorl22o which is probably E.H. To the Mycenaean period belongs a cist grave ('TOMB' in FIG. 16), I'80 X 0o80 m., covered with a large flat stone. Round the grave were scattered L.H. III sherds.221 On the summit of the hill a few Mycenaean sherds and obsidian fragments were found, and some classical black-glazed pottery, as well as iron scoriae of the same type as those found at Neapolis22z (above). Classical tombs are recorded from the neighbourhood of Potamos to the west, and it is possible that they may be connected with the classical occupation at this site. LIONI The tomb excavated by Stais at Lioni223 lies about a kilometre to north of Khora, and I50 metres to left of the road to Livadhi (FIG. I7A; Lioni tomb (b)). Another tomb (presumably the second tomb noted by Stais),ZZ4 a few yards to the south-west, has recently been cleared,2zs 216 Frazer, iii. 385-6; Riemann 29-31. The distance be- tween the remains at Kastri-Palaiopolis and those on the slopes of Palaiokastro agrees roughly with the Io stades (Pausanias, loc. cit.) between Skandeia and Kythera. 217 Leake, Travels in Northern Greece iii. 71-75; Benton 245. Miss Benton's argument is slightly weakened by the fact (as stated below) that the L.M.

HOPE SIMPSON THE CAVE OF AYIA SOPHIA The cave, marked on FIG. 23, lies to the south of the village of Kalamos, to east of Khora and about a kilometre south-east of the road from Khora to Kalamos, on one side of a steep gorge. Miss Benton found a L.M. I sherd here and 'polished Bronze Age pottery'.231 The stalagmites and stalactites at the back of the cave, and the situation in a steep gorge, alike support the suggestion of a Minoan cult cave. KASTRI AND PALAIOPOLIS Fieldwork in autumn and summer 1958 confirmed and amplified Miss Benton's results at Kastri,232 and established that occupation of the site was continuous from M.M. II to L.H./L.M. IIIB. In the eroded north-east cliff (where she found most of the Minoan pottery)233 there is clearly a thick M.M. III-L.M. I level at about 3 metres below the present surface. On the top are L.H./L.M. II-III sherds,234 With some classical black-glazed and Roman pottery and fragments from Roman glass bottles. In 1957 men widening the track from Avlemon to Mitata discovered a chamber tomb about 150 metres north of Kastri (FIG. I7B, plan; FIG. 18, marked '(a)').23s Three coarse ware painted jugs (M.M. III) were found (FIG. 19)236 together with over forty plain 'saucers' (as FIG. 20(b) I, 2), also mostly M.M. III. In summer 1958 continued road operations ruined two more tombs (FIG. 18 '(d)').z237 Sherds recovered from the vicinity in July 1958 showed that the tombs had been in use from M.M. II to L.M. II. Of particular interest are a M.M. IIB-IIIA 'Kamares' type Cup (PLATE 28C, I), a M.M. III One-handled Jug (PLATE 28a), two Rhytons (M.M. IIIB- L.M. IA) (PLATE 28b), and two L.M. IB Marine Style sherds (PLATE 28C, 4-5). There were also quantities of plain 'saucers' (as FIG. 20(a)).238 There is no doubt that many of the rock chambers at Kastri, Vothonas, and Asproga239 were once tombs. Miss Benton identified one as L.M. I,240 and there are prehistoric and classical sherds in the vicinity of others.z41 On the east side of Asproga half of a pithos is visible on the cliff edge, and 70 metres north of Kastri the rim of a large pithos (in situ ?)242 is protruding from the ground. There are now few visible remains of the town of Skandeia at Kastri and the mouth of the Palaiopolis River (which appears white on PLATE 27b). But there are traces of house walls in the sea to south of Kastri and Asproga,243 and squared blocks and fragments of columns at 231 BSA xxxii. 245. 232 Op. cit. 245-6. 233 Ibid. 234 Sherds from Kastri (1957) included M.M. II-III 'Kamares' ware and polychrome, M.M. III light-on-dark, M.M. IIIB-L.M. IA plain 'saucers', L.M./L.H. II 'Palace Style', and Kylix stems which seemed L.H. III rather than L.M. III. 23s The tomb was cleared by Mr. Petrocheilou, the head- master of the Gymnasion at Khora, and the pottery was taken to the Khora Museum. 236 Two are illustrated here; the third is similar, being of greyish clay (H. 0.034 m.) with traces of linear bands in olive paint. 237 Apparently the workmen were not so afraid of the 'demons' (Riemann, op. cit. 35) as were their forefathers. 238s Fragments of about twenty were recovered. An eye- witness account says that they were arranged in a circle round the sides of the tomb. 239 Riemann 23-25 and 32-35; Weil 227-8. 240 BSA xxxii. 246. 241 Prehistoric sherd distribution shown on FIG.

Tomb (C) on FIG. 18 is Riemann's D+E (p. 34), and the same as that in Benton pl. 42a. The niches in Riemann's A, B, and C are exactly similar to those in FIG. 17c here at Elleniko. Weil 227 compared them with tombs at Melos (Ross, Reisen aufden griechischen Inseln (1845) iii. Io ff.). They resemble Roman columbaria (Riemann 25). To north of these tombs is a pair of rectangular rock-cut graves, similar to some tombs at Neapolis (above) and also to some at Stymphalos in Arcadia and Kardamyle in Messenia (for the latter cf. BSA lii (1957) 236). They may be Hellenistic. 242 Marked '?pithos burial' on FIG. 18 (Middle Minoan?). 243 Castellan (Riemann 25), travelling in 1797 before the great earthquake of June 1798, saw towers to south of Asproga.

PALAIOKASTRO The summit of Palaiokastro was the acropolis of the ancient town of Kythera. An area about 900 metres north to south by 500 metres east to west was enclosed by a wall of large stones, with small stones used in the interstices.246 This might suggest a 'Cyclopean'247 style, but in fact the work is more akin to polygonal masonry. It may perhaps be Archaic. The best preserved section is on the north-west. The citadel is steep on all sides except the south, where there were strong towers to compensate.z48 The summit is now extremely bare and rocky, and it does not appear to have been much occupied.249 The lower town on the south slopes, about I,250 by 750 metres in extent, was also apparently walled (there are certainly remains of walling on the south-east side). Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds are abundant, especially on the lower south-west terraces. The Temple of Aphrodite does not lie under the chapel of Ayios Kosmas on the south-east slope, as Schliemann thought,2so despite the fact that there are built into the chapel the remains of four columns and six half-columns (all unfluted), four Doric capitals of poros stone, several large squared poros blocks, and part of an architrave with guttae. There are here no signs of a temple foundation, and the rock in the vicinity (bare in many places) has never been levelled, as it would have been for a temenos. Besides this, an ancient circuit wall passes within 15 metres of the chapel. A better location for the Temple (and one suggested by local informants) is on the south-west slope, about 400oo metres west of Ayios Kosmas. Here a small terrace called variously Koh?,vEs ('The Columns') or BiyES ('The Sentinels') once boasted two upright columns.zs2 These were unfluted, like the columns now in the chapel ofAyios Kosmas. There are now at this spot several squared poros blocks, a fragment of a metope, the remains of two unfluted columns, and a great quantity of classical sherds, the earliest recognizable being of the 246 Riemann 35-36; Weil 229. 247 Schliemann, reported in AJA iv (i888) 96. 248 Weil, loc. cit. Scanty remains of one are visible. 249 The marble pedestal used as an altar in the chapel of Agios Georgios on the summit is obviously moved from else- where. It closely resembles Aegina Taf. 66, 4. 250so His investigations (AJA loc. cit. and Zeitschrift fir Ethnologie xx (1888) 20 f.) were superficial. He said that two of the columns and one base (sic) were in situ. But the cement floor (not renewed since his day) would make any such observation impossible. 2s5 Well 230. Riemann 36 describes the place, and records that coins of Philip and Alexander were found here. The bronze head of a girl, seen by Stais in Berlin Museum (Riemann, loc. cit.), and a 4th cent. B.c. marble head of a youth (now in Khora Museum) also came from here, as did fragments of other marble statues.</page><page sequence="44">252 Loc. cit. 253 The tombs are described by Riemann 38-39. 254 Especially the tomb on the plateau of Tholari (Riemann, op. cit. 38) at BepytSocivia, which may be prehistoric. It has steps leading down to a small rectangular chamber with smaller chambers on either side, and a chamber of similar dimensions at the back. Seven skulls were found in the main chamber. The tomb is now empty. 255 Riemann 39. Apparently the deep ravine, which now exists between the remains of the channel in two places, was caused by earthquakes-quite possibly by the very severe earthquake of June 1798 (Riemann 29). The broken and rounded hillocks which partially fill the ravine certainly look as if they were the result of a landslip. The district is called 'AX6TI. 256 But the Marble Jug from Vothonas (AM xvi (1891) 53-54, Athens National Museum No. 3946, cf. Bericht. Berl. Akad. 1897, 265) might have been an heirloom. It much resembles Mochlos pl. iv (Tomb VI, 14). It is possibly E.M. II. The stone bowl from the Lioni tomb (ADelt i (1915) 192, fig. i, and PM ii. 20o8, fig. I I7B) is E.C. III, but it was found in a L.H. II-III chamber tomb (Kantor, The Aegean and the Orient (1947) pl. ivD (p. 8)). 257 BSA xxxii. 245; Furumark, OpArch vi. 201. 258 The Mesopotamian inscription (JHS lix (1939) 137-8) found at Palaiopolis is dated to the I8th cent. B.c. (JNES xvii (1958) 245); and the Inscribed Marble Vase (JHS xvii. 349-50) with the name, in hieroglyphs, of the Fifth Dynasty Sun Temple of the Pharoah Userkaf(JNES loc. cit.) testifies to even earlier connexions with Egypt. Evans (JHS xvii loc. cit.) also mentions as from Kythera 'a prism seal with a variety of conventionalised pictographic symbols .. .in company with a lentoid gem of the ordinary Mycenaean type'. 259 Within this period there was also a small settlement at Lioni, and the cave at Ayia Sophia was in use. 26o Cf. Miletus, Trianda in Rhodes, Cos, Phylakopi in Melos, and other sites in the Cyclades (Stubbings, Mycenaean Potteryfrom the Levant (I95I) 6-8; Furumark, OpArch vi. 150- 271; Scholes, BSA li (1956) 36-40). Some patterned sherds from Kastri (PLATE 28C, 6-9 especially) seem to show main- land influence. 261 Especially the Mycenaean figurine (Khora Museum 5 below) and the stirrup-vase (Khora Museum 6 below) from Palaiopolis. PREHISTORIC LACONIA: PART II 157 fifth century B.c. WeilzS22 noted some other architectural fragments. It is surely clear that the columns now in Ayios Kosmas were taken from this area; and that the Temple of Aphrodite should be looked for here. ELLENIKO AND MITATA At Elleniko in the district of Gonies, to east of Mitata and to left of the road from Avlemon to Mitata, there are several rock-cut tombs (FIG. 23, 'Elleniko', southernmost cross)zs53 in the side of a steep ravine leading into the Palaiopolis River. The tombs are much damaged, but one (FIG. I7c) much resembles tombs at Asproga (above), though its niches are better preserved. There are more tombs to east (FIG. 23, 'Elleniko', northernmost cross) and west254 Of the road a kilometre farther to the north. On the slopes of the ridge to west of the southern group of tombs, and between them and Mitata, is a chapel of Ayios Nikolaos, in whose vicinity are abundant classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds. To the south, on the east of the road, there is a channel, about 0o25 m. wide, cut in the rock, running north-west to south-east. This is apparently part of an ancient conduit which supplied the town of Skandeia at Kastri with water from the abundant springs at Gonies below Mitata.25zss In the valley between Palaiokastro and Mitata, at a place called Galati, are classical sherds. KYTHERA: SUMMARY The E.H. pottery on the north of the island is similar to that found on Elaphonisi, and the amount of obsidian (none has yet been found in the Kastri-Palaiopolis area) also suggests a con- nexion with Elaphonisi and Vatika, as does the poor quality of the L.H. pottery from the north of Kythera. It is by no means unlikely that Kastri was settled in E.H./E.M. times.256 There was undoubtedly a Minoan colony at Kastri in the Middle Minoan period,257 probably beginning in M.M. II, and it appears to have had contacts with the east.2ss The 'floruit' of the colony seems to have been in M.M. III-L.M. IA,2s59 but Cretan influence may have continued into L.M. II. At some time between the L.H. II and L.H. IIIB periods this influence was apparently replaced by Mycenaean,260 since some finds from the Palaiopolis area seem clearly L.H. III,26I and none are certainly L.M. III. The pottery from Vithoulas is clearly L.H. III. On the other</page><page sequence="45">158 HELEN WATERHOUSE AND R. HOPE SIMPSON hand, Furumark now maintains that the askos from the tomb at Lioniz62 (originally dated by him Myc. IIB) is Minoan rather than Mycenaean.263 It is as yet uncertain whether Kythera suffered the same fate at the hands of the Dorians as did Crete and Laconia. There are vases of the early Geometric period in Khora Museum (8 and 8a below), and several of the Archaic and early classical periods (9-I2 below), while from classical to Byzantine times the series is virtually complete (13-21 below, and many unlisted late Roman and Byzantine objects). Herodotus records (i. 105- 3; cf. Paus. i. 14. 7) that the temple of Aphrodite was a Phoenician foundation, and Xenophon mentions a harbour volw1KOUS On the island.264 Literary evidence asserts that Kythera was rich in purple (TrpqXipovoa).265 Presumably this period of Phoenician activity would be the 'dark ages' between the tenth and eighth centuries B.c.,266 unless the tradition really reflects Minoan antecedents;267 for, although we have instances of contacts between Kythera and the East in the Minoan period (above, n. 258), we have as yet no evidence for them in the Geometric period.

ANTIKYTHERA The ancient name of Antikythera was Aigilia26s (or Aigiliai), and the ruins of the fortress town of Aigilia lie at Palaiokastro (PLATE 29, FIG. 22)z69 on the north-east promontory of the island, 'Aiyihov Tr' &amp;Kpov' (Lycoph. Io8). The oldest fortifications enclosed only the small acropolis (about I75 by 75 metres). They are of Polygonal masonry (quarry face) in local limestone, and probably belong to the fifth century B.C.270 The extant remains are a stretch 268 Ancient sources: Pliny, NH iv.

These walls were replaced by rough Isodomic Ashlar masonry, also in the local limestone, apparently at some date between the late fifth and mid-fourth century B.c.272 Not only were the acropolis walls now reconstructed, but also an outer enceinte was added, enclosing an area of about 300,000 square metres, comprising the whole of the upper part of the promontory. In places on the north side these walls are 2 metres thick, and stand to a height of 41 metres. The walls were extensively repaired in the late classical or 271 The largest are about I1o I1o 0xo80 m.

HOPE SIMPSON Hellenistic period, this time in poros masonry.273 The style is variously Isodomic Trapezoidal (PLATE 29c, FIG. 22, 2),274 or Isodomic Ashlar,275s and may be dated between the last half of the fourth century B.c. and the end of the third century B.c., according to the provisional chronology worked out by Scranton. The earliest sherds picked up in the vicinity are of the late fifth or early fourth century B.c. (Catalogue, I and 4 below). The latest are of the first century B.c. or first century A.D. (8 below). There are many black-glazed sherds and amphora fragments. The area occupied by the ancient town comprises the southern two-thirds of the enceinte, the rest being barren and rocky. THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO Stais's excavations in 1889,276 on the shore beside the creek which must have been the ancient harbour, revealed a mosaic floor, and walls built with mortar (which he assumed to be Roman). Near them he found an inscription, set up by a Thessalian and an Athenian to 'Apollo of Aigilia',277 which belongs to the fourth or third century B.C. Stais very plausibly connected this inscription with the passage in Pausanias (ii. 7. 7) describing the visit of Apollo and Artemis to Aegialia after the slaying of Python. Part of a statue was also discovered, of Apollo playing a lyre.278 Below the 'Roman' walls were the foundations of a Hellenic building, one side of which was 12 metres long, made of squared isodomic blocks, joined by clamps. Stais assumed that he had found here the site of the Temple of Apollo. The remains are not now visible, but the lack of architectural fragments in the immediate area279 suggests that this is not quite so certain. There are, however, remains of other ancient walls in the gardens farther inland beside the stream bed.280 The inhabitants say that erosion caused by the stream is continually filling up the mouth of the creek, and there may be a chance that excavation would reveal the remains of a harbour and perhaps of the Temple. ANTIKYTHERA: SUMMARY No trace has yet been found of prehistoric occupation on the site of Palaiokastro. Stais's conjecture that the underground chamber at $uVca&lt;&amp;zsI was a prehistoric tomb cannot now be checked, but it seems unlikely. Leonhardzsz reported many tombs 'inland', which he said were dug in the marl soil of the 'northern plain' (sic). These tombs are not locally known. Staisz83 remarked that it is strange to find walls of such size and excellence on an island as insignificant as Antikythera; and he concluded that it must have been fortified in the Pelopon- nesian War, and used as a base in the same way as Kythera,284 because of its central position.285 Leonhardzs6 speaks of arrowheads and slingstones found near the walls. This suggests a siege, 273 The stone is from quarries within the walls at 1~vAaK1d (marked 4 on FIG. 22). Here Stais (op. cit. 242) found an underground chamber hewn in the rock. In 1958 the entrance was blocked by boulders, but it has not the normal appearance of a chamber tomb dromos. The description (of a square chamber with smaller chambers on either side) recalls the tomb (described above) at BspytSocivia near Mitata on Kythera. 274 The southernmost tower (now partially destroyed by a threshing floor) is in the same style-'Isodomic Trapezoidal; Pointed Face' (Scranton, op. cit. 173). t75 Especially the remains of a tower (marked 3 on FIG. 22) and part of the NE. wall. This style is 'Isodomic Ashlar: Pointed Work' (Scranton, op. cit. 178). 276 ADelt 1889, 239-41; cf. Frazer vi. 52-53. The excava- tions were said to have been on the right side of the stream (the presumed location is marked 5 on FIG. 22). 277 The text (Stais, op. cit. 233, 240) reads: Apa-rTOpEVrl ApitororlGSovS I e8) aO-A EK OEpCOV NIKCAv Kiq(pao8copo[u] AerlvatoS I ArroA[co]vt AlytIXE [a]VEwOlKaV. 278 Stais, op. cit. 233-4, 240. 279 Op. cit. 241. 280 In particular the corner of a building in Isodomic poros masonry near a well, in a garden to SW. of the stream (marked 6 on FIG. 22). 281 Op. cit. 242. 282 Die Insel Kythera 45. 283 Op. cit. 238-9. 284 Presumably by the Athenians in 424 B.c.

A possible explanation is that Aigilia was captured by the Athenians; and that the second walls (the rough Isodomic Ashlar), enclosing a larger enceinte, were erected by the Athenians at the same time as Skandeia was garrisoned, and for the same reason (Thuc. iv. 54- 4). The rough character of the walls, and the fact that there was apparently no time to remove the remains of the polygonal walling that still exist behind them, alike suggest the rapid execution of a military task. Of the surface sherds a considerable number belong to the early fourth century B.c. (cf. I-4 below), when one would expect the island to be recovering from the effects of the war (perhaps with an increased population and trade?). The floruit of Aigilia was obviously the fourth to third centuries B.C.,287 and it continued to be occupied until at least the first century A.D. Antikythera must often have been a port of refuge in rough weather, when it would be desirable to avoid Cape Malea.z288s CATALOGUE OF SELECTED SHERDS FROM ANTIKYTHERA i. Kantharos (FIG. 2 1(c)).

HOPE SIMPSON SUMMARY It must be emphasized that the conclusions to be drawn from our survey can at present seldom be more than tentative; but some general trends may be observed from the distribution of the sites in the various periods,289s and progress has been made towards the solution of the various problems posed by the literary evidence. NEOLITHIC (FIG. 24) The most important site is Kouphovouno in the Spartan plain, a low mound comparable in size to Lerna in the Argolid. Among the earliest settlements are the low hills of Asteri and Ayios Strategos.2z90o Only one example (at Apidia) of the later neolithic polychrome pottery has been discovered, but all the other periods are well represented. Surface finds suggest a prepon- derance of the earlier wares.2,z9' The quantity of stone artefacts from Kouphovouno may indicate that this was a centre for their manufacture. In general, the Laconian neolithic pottery agrees closely with that found in central and eastern Peloponnese,2z92 Attica,293 and Central Greece; and the distribution of the known sites suggests that the neolithic people first entered Laconia by sea,z94 via the Helos and Molaoi plains, and possibly also via the east coast at Monemvasia, if the solitary sherd from Epidaurus Limera is to be trusted. The position of the inland sites at Goritsa and Apidia (and Geraki?) suggests that several other neolithic sites await discovery, but the general pattern is already clear. With the exception of the two cave sites at Kambos and Goritsa, the settlements discovered are on low hills or mounds. Asteri and Goulas resemble Thessalian 'High Mounds'. All the sites continued to be occupied in the Early Helladic period. EARLY HELLADIC (FIG. 24) The settlements are widely diffused, with a large proportion on or near the coastline. The main concentrations are in the Helos and Sparta plains, with subsidiary groups in the Gythion area, the Molaoi plain, the Monemvasia district, and the Vatika plain and Elaphonisi. As in Attica, Corinthia, and the Argolid, the preference for coastal settlement suggests penetration by seaz2s and the importance of sea trade. Sites on low hills were preferred, but they also occur on the plains themselves (in particular Mavrovouni and the vicinity of Elaphonisi village) or on flat terraces (the Elaphonisi sites, and the north of Kythera). There is so far no evidence that any of the settlements were fortified. None of the pottery can be attributed with certainty to the 'E.H. I' period; but 'E.H. II' wares are common, especially at Palaiopyryi in the Sparta plain, and at Ayios Stephanos, Asteri, and Tsasi in the Helos plain, and they are very similar to those found in north and east Peloponnese,296 Attica,297 and Boeotia.298 It appears likely that the present lack of 'E.H. III' surface sherds from Laconia is only a chance result.299 It would be interesting to know whether some of the Laconian sites were destroyed at the end of the Early Helladic period, as in the 289 We regret that, for practical reasons, it has not yet proved possible to make a study of Mycenaean pottery in Laconia comparable to that of Attica (Stubbings, BSA xlii 947) I-75). 290 The earliest Peloponnesian neolithic 'Variegated Ware' (Corinth Class IA) and'Red Slipped Ware' (Corinth Class IB), are represented here. 291 Cf.

HOPE SIMPSON MIDDLE HELLADIC (FIG. 25) The number of Middle Helladic sites in the Helos plain, and the considerable quantity of M.H. pottery, particularly Minyan ware,303 on the main sites there (Ayios Stephanos and Asteri) suggests that the plain was the main point of entry for M.H. invaders coming into Laconia by sea,304 whence they reached north to the Sparta plain,305 north-east to Geraki and Apidia, and south-east to the Molaoi plain and Daimonia. The main Early Helladic centres were taken over, but it seems that some smaller E.H. settlements, particularly in the Mani, and in the Vatika plain and Elaphonisi, were not reoccupied.316 Hill sites were preferred, especially those of the 'acropolis' type,307 and some of these, in particular the Amyklaion, Geraki, and Ayios Stephanos, may have been first fortified in the latter part of the M.H. period or early in the Late Helladic period.308 LATE HELLADIC (FIG. 25) It is now generally accepted that there was no sharp break in culture between the Middle and Late Helladic periods, 309 and Laconia is no exception to this rule. Most of the major M.H. sites are known to have been inhabited also in L.H. I or L.H. II. With few exceptions3lo the L.H. I-II settlements are the same as the M.H. The real Mycenaean expansion begins in Laconia (as elsewhere) in the L.H. IIIA period (or perhaps at the very end of L.H. II),3x"x reaching its peak probably in the earlier part of L.H. IIIB.3z2 Although the lack of L.H. I-II sherds at some sites may be only accidental, it is probable that many of the smaller settlements were not occupied (or re-occupied)3'3 until the L.H. III period. The pattern of the L.H. III sites agrees remarkably well with that of the E.H., especially in the chief plains and on or near 303 Especially common are incised Minyan and local imita- tions of both Grey and Argive Minyan. Matt-painted is less common on the surface, but the quantity found in the excavations at the Amyklaion and Geraki indicates that this scarcity may not be a reliable guide. Sherds ofLight-on- dark ware have been found at Ayios Stephanos, Skala, and Gangania. 30o Mellaart, in AJA lxii. 9-33, esp. I9-20; Wace, in Docu- ments (foreword) xx-xxi; Gray, op. cit. 254-6. 305o M.H. is scarce on the surface at Palaiopyryi and Ayios Vasilios, but fairly common at the Amyklaion. No other sites are known in the plain. 306 It would be of some value in this connexion if it could be discovered whether or not Kouphovouno was occupied in M.H. (cf. Mellaart, op. cit. xI). 307 Good examples are Geraki, Apidia, Ayios Stephanos, Goulas, Daimonia, and Astros. 308 Mellaart, op. cit. 59, noted the appearance in the M.H. period of'feudal' centres such as Mycenae (cf. Gray, op. cit. 260) and Malthi-Dorion. See PART I under Geraki for the problem of the dating of the walls at Malthi and Geraki. We now have also the circuit walls (L.H. I?) at Ano Englianos (AJA lxiv (I960) x56). 309 Wace and Blegen, Klio xxxii. 2 (1939) Io-i I; Wace, in Documents (foreword) xx; Gray, op. cit. 260. More evidence will be forthcoming in AJA from a survey of sites in SW. Peloponnese by Professor W. A. McDonald and R. Hope Simpson. 3,0 The exceptions are, of course, established by 'negative evidence' alone, and it is to be expected that many of the sites will prove, after all, to have been occupied in M.H. as well. They are: the Menelaion (beginning late in L.H. II), Krokeai (begins L.H. II-III), Analipsis (begins L.H. I), Epidaurus Limera (begins L.H. I), and Stena (begins L.H. I or II). 3"x Notable are the L.H. II-IIIA pottery from the Mene- laion and the Amyklaion, the contents of the Vaphio and Analipsis tholoi, and the considerable amount of L.H. II- IIIA surface pottery of fine quality from Ayios Stephanos and Asteri. 3z2 The early part of L.H. IIIB was probably the floruit of the sites at the Menelaion, Ayios Stephanos, Asteri, and Lekas. N.B. For the time being we adopt the provisional chronology proposed by Wace, in PAPS I953, 424 n. 8, rather than that of Furumark (in Chron MP). Wace's chronology allows a time span of reasonable length (there is a case for making it even longer) for the obviously large mass of L.H. IIIB pottery in the Mycenaean world (cf.

But some of the larger sites may have been 'open' settlements, the outstanding examples being Palaiopyryi, the Menelaion, and Mavrovouni; while many of the smaller sites (also 'open') can hardly have been more than hamlets or farms.3'6 THE HOMERIC CATALOGUE OF SHIPS AND OTHER LITERARY EVIDENCE ot 8' ElXov KOi2rv AacKEoaitoOV KjTrE1CGaV, $&amp;pwiv TE XT'ndpTTV T"E "TrlJoTp11PCoVca 7E M~oorjv, Bpuoamds r' EviyovTO Kaci AOiyExs EpaTElVc5, oi r' &amp;p' ApCKnAS EIXov "EAoS r' Z~ahov Tr-rohiEpov, o7 re AdC1av EXOV i8' O'ruAov d&amp;ppEv~iovro, TrCOv o0 da615,p6oS PpXE, 3o iv d&amp;yca06 MevkcAoS, E+r1KOVTrc VECV.

Of these, Palaio- pyryi is the largest, both in the Sparta plain and indeed in all Laconia. The proximity of the Vaphio tomb testifies to its importance in the L.H. II period, while surface sherds seem to indicate a L.H. III floruit. &amp;)1p1, indeed, is mentioned first in the Catalogue, although this may have been for metrical reasons.319 The name pTrapTr1 occurs only once in the Iliad apart from the Catalogue passage,az3 and it is possible that the prominence of the name dates only from the Geometric (or Protogeometric?) period, when it was taken over as the name of the new capital city at Sparta. The evidence for locating BputaECi at Ayios Vasilios has been dis- cussed above. "EhoS, if it does not refer to the whole Helos plain, must surely have been the settlement at Ayios Stephanos.3zI It is still uncertain whether AiyElai should in fact be located at the site of the classical Aegiae.322zz Adcas is presumed to have been on the site of the Fort at Passava,323 although no conclusive evidence of Mycenaean occupation can be found there. 3's The known instances are a few sherds from the Amy- klaion, and some vases from chamber tombs at Epidaurus Limera. 316 e.g. Ayios Strategos, the small site to north of Asteri, and Ayios Ioannis and Xeronisi to west of Skala. 3"7 Burr, Klio Beiheft ix (1944) 53-58, takes AaKOE tICOV as having been originally the name of a polis (as Schol. ap. II. ii. 581), and regards it as the old Achaean name for Sparta. He believes that the name XTirprp is a Dorian intru- sion, and that the Achaean AaKE8&amp;Ivcov became in Dorian times a district name. But Koir1 and KTy)CEclCTC are surely intended as qualifications of a district name. In RE iiiAn (I929) s.v. Sparta, 1271-2, it is said that in Homer AaKsSaipclov only twice refers to the Kingdom of Menelaus (Od. xxi. 13, i5, and II. ii. 581-2), and that elsewhere it is used as equivalent to the city of Menelaus. But we should not expect consistency of meaning throughout the Iliad and Odyssey (cf. the ambiguity of the name Pylos). On the origin of the name, see Szemerfnyi, Glotta xxxviii (1959) 14-17. 3'8 Allen, The Homeric Catalogue of Ships (1921) 74, sum- marizes the topographical evidence; of. Thompson, LAAA iv (I911) 131. 3'r Burr, op. cit. 54. 320 Cf. Whitman, Homer and the Heroic Tradition (1958) 322 n. 12. 322 Trial excavations made at the site inJuly 1959 produced important stratigraphic evidence for the Middle and Late Helladic periods. 322 The mounds known locally as 'Tombs of Kings' are suggestive, but we found no surface indications for a Mycenaean site. It is worth noting that Aiysi&amp;s -' ipaErrE1V&amp; recurs in the Catalogue in the Locris section (II. ii. 532). A Homeric 'diplography' cannot be ruled out. 323 As noted in BSA xiii. 232-3, the situation is ideal for a Mycenaean fortress; but the nature of the ground makes it impossible to glean any surface indications.</page><page sequence="62">I74 HELEN WATERHOUSE AND R. HOPE SIMPSON The traditions attaching to Cranae3z4 and classical Las3Z5 (at the foot of Passava), as well as the important Mycenaean settlement at Mavrovouni, all testify to the early importance of this district. As far as can be judged in the absence of definite proof, OTiruAos lay on the site of the present village of Ano Oitylos, and Micra on Tigani near Mezzapo.326 It is unlikely that these last two towns were important in the Mycenaean period, since there appears to be little Bronze Age occupation in southern Mani. The distribution reflected in the Catalogue, covering the main plains and the Tainaron promontory, makes sense geographically. The omission of the Malea peninsula may be surpris- ing, but Kynouria seems to have had more connexions with Attica (cf. the Palaiochori tombs) and the Argolid (Paus. iii. 2. 2; 23. 6-7 (Epidaurus Limera)) than with Laconia. Apart from the Catalogue, Cranae and Kythera both feature in the Iliad,327 and there are pre-Dorian traditions connected with other Mycenaean settlement sites in Laconia,328 particu- larly Pellana, the home of the Tyndareus legend, and Geronthrae (both of which might have been expected to feature in the Catalogue), while the site at Arkines may have had something to do with the still unexplained story in Herodotus about the Minyans in Taygetus.329 Amyklai, Pharis, Geronthrae, and Helos were traditionally associated with the Dorian Invasion33o (or the 'Return of the Heracleidae').33' Pharis and Geronthrae gave in at the first onslaught of the Dorians, but Amyklai and Helos resisted.33z The archaeological evidence supports the traditions, suggesting as it does a breaking-up of Mycenaean civilization in Laconia during L.H. IIIC, and even considerable depopulation,333 whatever the impact of the Dorian Invasion may have been elsewhere.334 It is difficult to assess the degree of continuity in Laconia from the latest Mycenaean to the Protogeometric styles,33s since Laconian Protogeometric has so far been found at few sites336 (FIG. 26), and in quantity only at the Amyklaion; but it appears to have begun later than the Attic Protogeometric.337 The present evidence certainly indicates a period of 'Dark Age' in Laconia at the end of the Mycenaean period,338 when some major Mycenaean settlements were abandoned.339 Only later do the new 'Dorian' cities begin to 324 IL. iii. 443-6; cf. Paus. iii. 22. 1-2. 32s Paus. iii. 24. 6-8 and Io-II; Strabo viii. 5. 3 and 5. Strabo says that the Dioscuri sacked Las, and were called 'Lapersae' (cf. Schol. ad Lycoph. Alex.

The epithet orrourptipcova is also used of Thisbe in the Catalogue (II. ii. 502). 327 Cranae--II. iii. 445 (but the suggestion by Allen, op. cit. 67 n. 2, that Agamemnon's Corinthian and Arcadian forces could have gathered here is geographically absurd).

Huxley, BICS iii (1956) 25, and Broneer, Antiquity xxxii (I958) 8o-83. 332 Particularly Amyklai (Paus. iii. 2. 6). In the case of Helos resistance is implied by the word 'IohuopKia (Paus. iii. 20. 6). s33 Cf. Desborough, Protogeometric Pottery 296-7. Pausanias (vii. I. 5) records the expulsion of the Achaeans from Lacedaemon and Argos by the Dorians, while Strabo (viii. 5. 5) says that the Achaeans migrated at this time from Laconia to Achaea (on Achaea, cf. AJA lxiv (I960) I-21, esp. 19-20). 334 Attempts have been made to explain away an actual 'Dorian Invasion' (e.g. Wace, in Historia ii (1953) 91 and Viking (1954) 222, cf. Documents (foreword) xxviii-xxxi). But the literary evidence is firm and, where it can be checked, appears to be borne out by archaeology (cf. Hammond, BSA xxxii (193 I-2) 151-79; Broneer, in Antiquity xxx (1956) 16; Desborough, op. cit. 296-7). The question is well summed up by Gray in Myres, Homer and His Critics (1958) 276-83. 33s Desborough, op. cit. 287. 336 At Sparta on the acropolis and the Chalkioikos site (Desborough, op. cit. 289-90), and at the Amyklaion, Mavrovouni, Apidia, and Daimonia. 337 And the transition from Protogeometric to Geometric in Laconia occurs later than the same transition in Attica (Desborough, op. cit. 294-5, cf. 287-8 and 293). 338s Possibly from c.

The status of Mycenaean Laconia as compared with Mycenaean Argolis corresponds accurately enough with the relationship between the Kingdom of Menelaus and that of his brother Agamemnon in Homer;344 and there is no reason to suppose that the Palace of Menelaus, when it is discovered, will prove far inferior to that of Agamemnon or Nestor.
