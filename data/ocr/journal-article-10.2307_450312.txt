Historically Keats's narrative powers have been demeaned, ignored, or re-defined;' or as Miriam Allott describes the critical process, they have been picked over "for evidence of 'rich sensuousness', 'poetic effects', vivid picture-making and a vaguely defined 'principle of Beauty', varied by a little source-hunting and talk of influences."2 The reasons for this attitude toward Keats's narratives can be found at least in part in matters of genre history and cultural/critical taste, the former outlined by Robert Scholes and Robert Kellogg in The Nature of Narrative and the latter by Karl Kroeber. Scholes and Kellogg argue that critics since the time of Keats have been "almost hopelessly novel-centered"3 and tend to define and evaluate narrative art chiefly in terms of the special requirements and virtues of this relatively recent addition to the variety of narrative forms, particularly the novel's historic emphasis on "realism" and "rationality": The expectations which readers bring to narrative literary works are based on their experience with the novel. Their assumptions about what a narrative should be are derived from their understanding of the novel. And this is true whether the reader is a professor of contemporary literature 'James Alexander K. Thomson, for example, concludes that "as Keats never showed any skill in narrative, we may (if we like) doubt if the completed Hyperion would have equalled Paradise Lost in constructive skill," in Classical Influences on English Poetry (London, 1951), p. 71.

The very word "novel" has become a term of praise when applied to earlier narratives. We are told on dust-jackets and paperback covers that such diverse works as Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, and Homer's Odyssey are "the first novel." But if we take these designations seriously, we are bound to be disappointed. Judged as a "novelist" even Homer must be found wanting.4 Karl Kroeber, in what remains the most comprehensive and fair- minded study of Romantic narrative poetry as a subgenre, identifies a second explanation for fallibility in narrative criticism: It is a commentary upon the present low estate of narrative verse that most modern techniques of literary criticism are derived from investigations of lyric and dramatic poetry. These methods have only limited usefulness in the study of narrative poetry, the outstanding characteristic of which, when it is contrasted to lyric or dramatic verse, is its movement, its flow in time. Of necessity a play is concerned with a dramatic situation. A lyric is-relatively-so brief that we may without danger of going far wrong consider it temporally self-contained, timeless in the way that a painting is timeless. But a narrative is a temporal process. As E. M. Forster observes, the question we ask of the storyteller is "What happens next?"5 As a poet who often relied on the narrative mode, Keats was inevitably and repeatedly challenged to tell his story in the most truthful and skillful way, and it is in the characteristic signature of the telling that Keats's aesthetic necessities of time emerge. Indeed, the chronological and sequential relationships of events in his work have often drawn negative critical responses, ranging from charges that Keats lacks the narrative skill to get his story moving, to objections that he cannot conclude his narratives satisfactorily, and even to claims that he is unsuccessful as a narrative artist.6 What all these adverse comments IScholes and Kellogg, p. 8. 5Karl Kroeber, Romantic Narrative Art (Madison, 1960), p. 6. 6See, e.g., Graham Hough, The Romantic Poets, 2nd. ed. (New York, 1964), p. 179, on the odes: "Keats found his real medium here, far more than in the narrative poems"; Miriam Allott, p. 49, describes Endymion: "The tiredness and confusion of the ending, with its perfunctory revelations and its contrived solution" and finds "a similar flatness in 'The Eve of St. Agnes' while Keats is trying to get the action under way."

Allan Danzig (Englewood</page><page sequence="3">JA CQUELINE ZEFF 623 generally share is a commitment to narrative structure which operates in a realistic, even literal time dimension, in a mode of action whose validity derives from its familiarity. Very often, however, Keats's narratives offer multiple, ambiguous levels of time and consequently of sequences of events, such that to judge one level alone is necessarily inadequate and ultimately unjust. When Karl Kroeber asserts the importance of narrative to all English Romantic poets he properly attributes its ubiquitous popularity to aesthetic needs. The Romantic artist, according to Kroeber, in turning as he so often did to the narrative poem, is not only thereby declaring his independence from eighteenth-century preferences but affirming his image of the poet as a "man speaking to men."7 The narrative form provided for the Romantic poet "a means of embodying significant moral and psychological insight without becoming meditative and abstractly philosophical."8 This observa- tion is especially relevant to the study of Keats, a poet who viewed poetry as a "friend/ To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man" and the poet as "'a sage;/ A humanist, physician to all men.'"9 An artist thus concerned with the effect and affect of his work, and more specifically with teaching and comforting, is also vitally involved in the issue of gaining his reader's trust. This discussion will argue that Keats evoked that trust at least in part through reliance on accumulated layers of time, of times, of histories, of individual and collective pasts, manipulating narrative sequences as a means of adding credibility and authority to his work. Endymion offers a challenge in its configurations of time to those who would impose their own "palpable design" of linear realism on Keats's narrative. Keats's metaphoric journey through the seasons as Cliffs, 1971), p. 15, offers praise of The Eve of St. Agnes but at what cost: "Thus The Eve of St. Agnes is conspicuous for the firmness with which the story is controlled from start to finish." 7Kroeber, pp. 42-47. XKroeber, p. 43. 9John Keats, Keats: Poetical Works, ed. H. W. Garrod (London, 1970), p. 48, 406-all future references to Keats's poetry are from this edition, cited parenthetically in the body of the text. My view here departs from that of critics who maintain that Keats eventually rejects the ministerial functions of the poet. Morris Dickstein, for example, in Keats and His Poetry: A Study in Development (Chicago, 1971), marks the end of this belief with the Indian Maid's lament, by which time Keats "has lost faith in his old view of art as therapy, as compensation or consolation for the human condition" (p. 116). Perhaps my attitude and Dickstein's can be reconciled by perceiving a change in Keats from an "old" view of therapy to a "new" one, the kind of change Dickstein may be suggesting when he affirms Keats's desire to preserve the bower by altering its regressive character (p. 91).</page><page sequence="4">624 KEATS'S NARRATIVES he proposes to "trace" his story in Book I underscores the complex nature of time in his ensuing poem.'0 Endymion's adventure will grow as it unfolds, and the implications of seasonal change will document and interpret this growth. Keats begins his narrative in the spring of the year and, likewise, in the spring of his imagination, as each pleasant scene Is growing fresh before me as the green Of our own vallies.... (I. 37-39) Endymion's first adventures should parallel, if this parallel is indeed operative, "early budders" which "run in mazes of the youngest hue/ About old forests" (I. 41, 42-44). The labyrinth of confusion and uncertainty is recalled at the close of this poetic preface when Keats proclaims: And now at once, adventuresome, I send My herald thought into a wilderness: There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress My uncertain path with green, that I may speed Easily onward, through flowers and weed. (I. 58-62) Keats's first time epoch is indeed soon mirrored in his narrative, in the description of the "wide lawn" into which the children run. The landscape is fully grown and pulsing with "this sun-rise and its glories old" (I. 106). The rising of the sun for Keats does not trigger the usual associations of rebirth, new dawning, refreshment, but rather "its glories old." Death, however sweet, hovers over the youthful inhabitants and "flowers budded newly" (I. 91). Anthropomorphic music "fill'd out its voice, and died away again" (I. 116) and the funereal clouds resemble "a silvery pyre" (I. 96). As the worshippers enter the scene, Keats reintroduces his poet-persona, thereby insisting on his presence and in fact his essence in the nature metaphor he has offered to his reader. The narrative voice prays for poetic power to tell properly of "this goodly company/ Of their old piety, and of their glee" (I. 129-130), and articulates most explicitly who his "old forest" is: "that I may dare, in wayfaring,/ To stammer where old Chaucer '0For another approach to Endymion's nature calendar see HuberL Heinen, "Interwoven Time in Keats's Poetry," TSLL, 3 (1961), 382-388.</page><page sequence="5">JACQUELINE ZEFF 625 us'd to sing" (I. 133-134). Multiple meanings of youth and age thus commingle in this opening section: the earth is young as is the poet, but its processes and contents are old as are the poet's subject and inspirations. Endymion's first description culminates and illumi- nates this level of narrative time or timing. He is young but "his youth was fully blown/ Showing like Ganymede to manhood grown" (I. 169-170). Keats's myth selection here is a rich commentary on its context. Ganymede, a mortal, is chosen by Jove to be cupbearer to the gods, much to Juno's dismay since her own choice, Hebe, is thus affronted. Once again the Olympians seek out human contact and affection as a kind of revitalization and escape from the sterility of an immortality without love, but the benefit for the human agent is not always clear and is more likely to be disastrous (see Metamor- phoses, e.g., Io, Daphne, Syrinx). The details of Ganymede's fate foreshadow one of Endymion's adventures, for both young men are carried away on eagles at the instigation of enamored deities (see Metamorphoses, Book 10). The Ganymede analogy underscores the ambivalent nature of Endymion's experiences and final "victory" over mortality. Just as Ganymede is immortalized, but at the cost of his human potential, so too Endymion confronts the worship of Pan and his own divine contacts with apprehension, uncertain as to the cost-benefit ratio between human will and divine communion. The benefits of becoming another Ganymede are clear to the priest and worshippers: "Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad Sickens our fearful ewes. (I. 214-218) It is only "common lookers on" (I. 176), however, who see Endymion's smile as a sign of his delight at being "chosen": But there were some who feelingly could scan A lurking trouble in his nether lip, And see that oftentimes the reins would slip Through his forgotten hands. ... (I. 178-181) It is indeed a journey through "Flowers and weed" which Endymion undergoes, but not in a conventional sense of sequence, i.e., from flower to weed or from weed to flower in a vertical</page><page sequence="6">626 KEATS'S NARRATIVES progression, not from human love to divine love, from the real to the ideal or from nature to heaven; in his many memorable descriptions of the poetic process Keats avoids common and obvious analogies for such vertical progression and selects instead the language of growth and structure-mansion, vale-and most importantly in this narrative, the language of a perpetual journey. The grand plan expressed in Sleep and Poetry will be literally and metaphorically fulfilled in Endymion: Then will I pass the countries that I see In long perspective, and continually Taste their pure fountains. (Sleep and Poetry, 99-101) Endymion moves through levels of flower and weed, each appropri- ate to the time of his progress. Keats's seasonal introduction moves from the "early budders" to the "quiet hours" and "bowers" and hidden "deep herbage" of late summer (I. 41, 47, 48, 51). Much of Book II and Book III consists of "quiet" and "hidden" adventures in bowers, valleys, and caves, complete with sleeping gods and mortals, culminating in the Cave of Quietude in Book IV. The crises which persistently engage Endymion change little in basic plot; it is their environments which change and hence their values. Just as Endymion is oblivious to the Pan worshippers in Book I, so too in Book IV "no charm/ Could lift Endymion's head" (IV.556-557). Just as Peona soothes him to sanity with music in Book I, so too the Indian Maid sings to him "for pity" in Book IV (145). Morris Dickstein notes, with considerable validity, that in the Cave of Quietude, as in Peona's bower in Book I (452-464), the bower offers the traditional reward of sleep and renewal, but not the visionary access promised through "magic sleep" as the great key To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy, Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves, Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world Of silvery enchantment! (I. 456-461) What Dickstein concludes from this change in the bower's potential supports what many critics sense as Keats's disenchantment with enchantment, i.e., a rejection or at least uncertainty as to the powers</page><page sequence="7">JACQUELINE ZEFF 627 of the imagination by the time Keats completes his longest narrative. Endymion challenges this critical position by its very existence; the bower's promise in Book I is fulfilled structurally by Keats's craft; in fact the passage cited above could well serve as an outline of the poem's content. In a more literary sense as well, the aesthetic premise of the poem is not violated or rejected as the poem progresses. What some fail to consider is that this poem is founded on a seasonal metaphor whose fundamental nature is cyclical, not sequential, with both the past and the future midwives to the present. Keats's account of "Autumn bold" in the opening of Endymion is prophetically suited to the conclusion of his poem and true to the view which Keats will express in his last great poem, dedicated to that favorite of seasons, "To Autumn." The season has a "universal tinge of sober gold" as does the end of the narrative. The poet in the springtime of his poem asks that he not conclude it in the winter season. On the simplest level, of course, this comment reflects the impatience of a young poet-narrator eager to get on with his plan of work, but in the context of Keats's poem and his future paths in poetry, it is a plea as much for a state of mind as it is for a state of art. The Indian Maid's song is one of "sober gold," and when she reveals herself as Phoebe it is via the transformation of "long black hair swell'd ampler, in display/ Full golden" (IV. 984- 985). It is not the illusion of springtime which Keats's persona must defend himself against or reject, for "golden keys" are as much a part of autumn as of spring, but rather against "bare and hoary" winter (I. 54). Despair, or what has become in modern literature a nihilistic distortion of realism, will trouble Keats throughout his poetic career, and the insistence on levels of time can be equated with his insistence on levels of reality to defend against this despair. If indeed Keats suffers the "embarassment of the past," he no less achieves retaliation against the future by creating "things" of beauty which "will never/ Pass into nothingness" (Endymion, I. 2-3). It may seem a long way to travel from time and the timing of event to matters of theme, but such distance is minimized when the reader asks the question of duration in Endymion, i.e., how long does the hero's adventure last-six days? instants? ages? It is not enough to argue for the psychological nature of the "trip" as a way of dispelling the relevance of the question, for psychological realities, albeit different from physical realities, still abide by standards, however idiosyncratic. What is crucial about time as theme in Endymion is precisely that one cannot determine even in gross terms whether the hero's mental journey is more like that of Leopold Bloom or Ivan Illych. The only clear time reference offered is that discussed earlier in</page><page sequence="8">628 KEA TS'S NARRATIVES terms of seasonal progression, and even this cannot definitively be termed discrete or continuous. If the absence of a time framework is acknowledged, the question then becomes one of evaluation and purpose-is this an oversight or weakness in the poet, or a functional technique? To this writer's mind, the answer is a combination of craft and weakness; when Keats consciously deals with time, his results are often adequate, even exciting, but when he ignores or forgets this dimension of narrative, the results are glaringly unsatisfactory. The transition from Book I to Book II, the period between Endymion's conversation with Peona and his encounter with the nymph is at first loosely but clearly documented. He has been wandering "for many days" (II. 47). As Endymion's adventure begins, however, by following the "golden butterfly," Keats becomes more artfully vague: And like a new-born spirit did he pass Through the green evening quiet in the sun, O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun, Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams The summer time away. (II. 70-74, italics mine) Endymion travels through time as if from place to place which the underscored words suggest. In one sense a single day has passed, but Keats's careful selection of language complicates that interpretation. "Sleepy twilight" suggests a possible new arousal or awakening which can mean either a return to places known to man (for Endymion leaves a "solitary glen/ Where there was never sound of mortal men" [II. 77-79]), or twilight's transformation into dawn. The ambiguity of this scene is fulfilled in the description which follows as Endymion, fleeing from "the clear moon" (II. 218) and what must be now bright evening, follows "airy voices" (II. 213) into a region with no physical correlative: Dark, nor light, The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly, But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy; A dusky empire and its diadems; One faint eternal eventide of gems. (II. 221-225) From this point, the time sequence is unclear and often unmentioned at what would seem logical opportunities for clarification. Endymion travels through "a thousand mazes" (II. 387)</page><page sequence="9">JACQUELINE ZEFF 629 before reaching the bower of Adonis. When the encounter ends, he is "once again in twilight lone" (II. 587). Whether this is a mental state or still the same or the next twilight is uncertain. He then "long" (II. 611) examines the beauties in his path. He later dawdles, loses his sense of location, and travels on an eagle to the jasmine bower. After this encounter "Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder/ On all his life" (II. 886-887). He recalls with some specificity all the events up until the Pan festival and "his sister's sorrow" (II. 898), but all that the reader has witnessed since Book I is included in this review merely as "his wanderings all" (II. 898). Keats's refusal to allow Endymion to reiterate his adventures can be seen as dictated by the demands of narrative, i.e., to summarize is to delay even further the journey and to bore the reader. Keats could, however, have avoided summary and instead established at this point a truly meditative hero who differentiates and evaluates his experiences, and shares his insights with the reader. Endymion is not allowed to reveal the results, if any, of his "pondering" and it is at this point that Keats's control of time levels degenerates. Why the reader and Endymion pause here is not explained or justified, nor perhaps can it be. When the song of Arethusa and Alpheus interrupts Endymion's "sudden thoughts" (II. 919) Endymion "left thinking of the mystery" (II. 930) but unfortunately for Keats's poem, his reader does not. When the lovers' tale is ended, Keats tries to impose a speed which is neither integrative nor essential through what has to be one of the most unsatisfying passages in the poem and the most unconvincing of the four concluding ones: He turn'd-there was a whelming sound-he stept, There was a cooler light; and so he kept Towards it by a sandy path, and lo! More suddenly than doth a moment go; The visions of the earth were gone and fled- He saw the giant sea above his head. (II. 1018-1023) Keats must have sensed the false urgency which concludes his second book, for the opening address of Book III returns, abruptly but necessarily, to a slower pace of thickening entanglement for Endymion. Keats acknowledges the existence of "throned seats unscalable/ But by a patient wing, a constant spell" (III. 23-24), advice as well suited to his own growing impatience with his poem as to his hero who asks the moon to "forgive/ That I can think away from thee and live!" (III. 183-184). As Keats prepares the scene of encounter between Glaucus and Endymion he delineates the issues at</page><page sequence="10">630 KEATS'S NARRATIVES stake for Glaucus quite clearly, but not so for Endymion. Glaucus is described as an "old man" or more precisely a quasi-corpse, enshrouded in his mantle: Upon a weeded rock this old man sat, And his white hair was awful, and a mat Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet; And, ample as the largest winding-sheet, A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones, O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans Of ambitious magic. (III. 193-199) Like the "wintry season" of Book I, Glaucus has a "hoary" head, and the final touch of his ancestry is offered in his first movement. Glaucus lifts his head and sees The wilder'd stranger-seeming not to see, His features were so lifeless. Suddenly He woke as from a trance; (III. 218-221) Glaucus resembles Endymion in his trance-like condition, but in his awakening he is also like Adonis, Narcissus, and other victims of divine intervention. Glaucus' hopes and what Endymion represents to him are clear: "'O Jove,'" exclaims Glaucus, "'I shall be young again, be young!"' (III. 237). What, in turn, does Endymion expect from Glaucus? His first impulse is not to cheer "new born life" (III. 239) but rather to ask: "'What lonely death am I to die/ In this cold region?"' (III. 258-259). Endymion does indeed fulfill Glaucus' expectations, Glaucus who is a "young soul in age's mask" (III. 310). The long imprisonment which Glaucus recalls compounds the levels of time in the narrative, for if Glaucus has been waiting all this time for prophecy to be fulfilled, then the arrival of Endymion is not solely explained by his infatuation with Cynthia but rather hints of a longer predestined history for this "youth elect" (III. 710). Endymion is "overjoy'd" (III. 712) that he and Glaucus "'are twin brothers in this destiny!"' (III. 713) but the ironic implications of his remark are lost unless the multiplicity of time levels is appreciated. It is Glaucus' "destiny," not Endymion's, which is "twinning" them here, but perhaps Endymion is relieved to find a potential brother in his destiny-a role which Glaucus will not fulfill. The full reconcilia- tion of Endymion's share in Glaucus' destiny and the latter's contribution to Endymion's is not offered, to the detriment of the poem's roundness, but perhaps this weakness indicates a sophisticat-</page><page sequence="11">JACQUELINE ZEFF 631 ed technique not yet mastered, i.e., the manipulation of transcendent histories. The "problem" of converging destinies in Book III is not unlike the "problem" of converging loves which concludes the poem. If the Indian Maid is a predetermined "test" for Endymion with divine guidance prompting his decision, then his choice is hardly significant or satisfying, as Dickstein and others have commented. If, on the other hand, Endymion is the Indian Maid's "savior" as he was Glaucus', then the "problem" of the poem becomes one of craft rather than of conviction. When the Indian Maid concludes her song she looks, like Glaucus, "quite dead to every worldly thing" (IV. 292), and once again Endymion is the agent of revival. Critics have long considered the Glaucus and Indian Maid episodes, for better or worse, to be "lessons" for Endymion, but the action of the narrative reveals at least reciprocity in benefit, if not in fact the reverse relationship. If these episodes are in fact lessons for Endymion, the poem's meaning and structure seem "neater" if less interesting. But Endymion is not the only dreamer awakened, nor the only one to win immortality as reward for love, for his beloved goddess' future happiness is assured by Endymion's love, as she notes: Dearest Endymion! my entire love! How have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done- Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won. (III. 1022-1024) Endymion expresses his impatience with his creator, i.e., with Keats's indecision as to whose destiny is indeed being dramatized, when he exclaims in Book IV: "'let our fate stop here' " (IV. 633). Endymion's impatience mirrors a part of Keats but cannot be equated with Keats; Keats does not abandon his poem (as his hero abandons his first love) nor does he abandon the lessons he has learned from it, for the same awareness of multiple time progressions, of converging histories, will be pursued with much more success in Lamia and The Eve of St. Agnes. Keats relies on Peona to establish a realistic time dimension in his poem. She "will pull/ The flowers of autumn for your coronals" (IV. 813-814) which can be viewed as an attempt to fulfill the poet's seasonal promise of Book I and, more importantly, as an attempt to reassert Endymion's active role in his own destiny. She urges Endymion to behave as if time has not passed: "O feel as if it were a common day; Free-voic'd as one who never was away." (IV. 820-821)</page><page sequence="12">632 KEATS'S NARRATIVES Peona likewise condenses the time sequence of the narrative when she assures Endymion that "Not even I, for one whole month, will pry Into the hours that have pass'd us by, Since in my arbour I did sing to thee." (IV. 824-826) Peona's use of "hours" provides a concrete, brief reference point for Endymion's absence from the realities of his community, which contrasts the extended, ambiguous time dimension of the preceding two books, both in terms of content and rhetoric. The reader has no reason to question Peona's accuracy, but the reader should wonder why this accuracy now exists and why the apparent discrepancy between books. This discrepancy is a credit to Keats's complex sense of time; its unhappy jarring quality is a symptom of the poet's inadequate control of this sense. Critical opinion concurs that Lamia is a far superior poem to Endymion in its technical and narrative virtuosity. The opening "digression," for example, does not evoke the charge of irrelevance and looseness of structure which opening sections in Endymion have aroused, and in many ways deserved. The masterful integrity of the opening Hermes episode is, however, praised and considered almost exclusively for its thematic relationship to the central action, i.e., its assertion that "real are the dreams of Gods" (I. 127). Keats opens his poem with the language of the fairy tale, "upon a time" (I. 1), but manipulates this universalization of his tale by defeating any expectations of a familiar fairy tale structure in the lines which follow. Keats clearly dates his scene in the times of myth, the times before the faery broods Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods, Before king Oberon's bright diadem, Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem, Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns.... (I. 1-6, italics mine) Keats ingeniously lures his reader back to the time of Greek mythology, not by embarking on an ancient myth directly, but by reminding his reader of a time which followed the age of classicism, i.e., when Olympus gave way to pastoral divinity, or in Northrop Frye's terms, when myth lost its hold on man's mind to be replaced by</page><page sequence="13">JACQUELINE ZEFF 633 romance: "In the period of romance, the poet, like the corresponding hero, has become a human being, and the god has retreated to the sky. His function now is primarily to remember."" The words which Keats selects to describe Lamia are likewise saturated with classical myth, but filtered through echoes/prophecies of later narrative universes: She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf, Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self. Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar. (I. 55-58) Multiple levels of historic reference thus commingle in the heroine's personal history to complicate her portrait and add to the mystery generated by her own account of her origins when she offers still another ancestor, mortal woman: "I was a woman, let me have once more A woman's shape, and charming as before." (I. 117-118) Whether Lamia's existence began in the human state or whether her mortal condition was merely one of several previous transformations is not certain, an ambiguity which enriches the mysteries of the time dimension in the poem.'2 The effect of these histories on the action, as on the reader, is to compound the meaning of the past and to generate questions about the relationship between cause and effect. The "time" of myth and romance coexist in Lamia as in her narrative, and converge with human dimensions of time passing. Keats is no longer the poet who, through naive nostalgia, can only lament the passing of ages which produced myth and romance, as in his dedication poem in the 1817 collection. Nor is he the hopeful, if not successful, poet- persona of Endymion who argues that "things" of beauty necessarily increase in "loveliness." By beginning Lamia in the middle of past times and by creating a heroine who defies autopsy, Keats demonstrates a profound and maturing understanding of the nature of memory and the realities of man's spiritual history, an understand- "Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (New York, 1957), pp. 56-57.

Reiman, "Keats and the Humanistic Paradox: Mythological History in Lamia," SEL, 11 (1971), 659-669.</page><page sequence="14">634 KEATS'S NARRATIVES ing which will energize the two Hyperions as well as the great odes, heralded in the Ode to Psyche. As Keats turns his attention to Lamia's current activities he maintains the sense of multiple histories by combining accounts of her immediate past and "past" past: Why this fair creature chose so faerily By the wayside to linger, we shall see; But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse And dream, when in the serpent prison-house, Of all she list, strange or magnificent: How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went. (I. 200-205) He then moves from her pre-Lycian history to her Lycian history as if embarking on still another tale: And once, while among mortals dreaming thus, She saw the young Corinthian Lycius Charioting foremost in the envious race, Like a young Jove with calm uneager face, And fell into a swooning love of him. (I. 215-219) When Keats finally comes to the meeting between Lycius and Lamia, he tells it in the past tense, as if reluctant to allow the narrative to become immediate and the reader to become a witness to dramatic action. He even pauses to recount Lycius' mission and its outcome which occurred before his fateful walk: he sailed on a galley, which Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare. Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire.... (I. 222-229) In this "past-perfect" poem, Lycius fears the loss of his beloved and pleads with her to stay, not in terms of the loss of her presence, but rather in terms of the destructive power of his memory of her: "'if thou shouldst fade/ Thy memory will waste me to a shade"' (I. 269- 270). Lamia asks Lycius in turn to reward her sacrifice of immortality not in terms of substituting mortal pleasures for divine bliss, but by distracting her memory:</page><page sequence="15">JACQUELINE ZEFF 635 "If I should stay," Said Lamia, "here, upon this floor of clay, And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough, What canst thou say or do of charm enough To dull the nice remembrance of my home?" (I. 271-275) Apollonius' concomitant annihilation of Lycius and Lamia, whatever else its philosophic and thematic implications, is the terrible banishment of all levels of time except the present, the effect of which is pronounced by Apollonius himself: "Fool! Fool!" repeated he, while his eyes still Relented not, nor mov'd; "from every ill Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day, And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?" (II. 295-298) Lamia is thus not the only character in the poem who would "unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain" (I. 192), and cannot thus be seen as an opposing pole to Apollonius so much as an alternative attempt to banish the past. The denial of Lamia by Apollonius is as disastrous as any of Lamia's personal denials of her past, as measured in terms of its effect on Lycius, which suggests that Keats's response to his former nostalgia is not to reject the validity of former times and former spiritual constructs so much as to accept man's need for myth and to dedicate himself, here implicitly and later explicitly, to providing new accessibility to the past in his poetry. The full realization that man's collective past and correspondent memories "alway[s] must be with us, or we die" (Endymion, I. 33) is a cumulative experience for Keats, surfacing in various forms-in his devotion to Psyche and Moneta, in his reconciliation to the "sylvan historian" (Ode on a Grecian Urn), in his identification with the "selfsame song that found a path/ Through the sad heart of Ruth" (Ode to a Nightingale). Apollonius is, like his Joycean heir, trying to awake from the nightmare of history, but for Keats, losing the "sweet dream" is fatal to man's psychic life. Keats ideologically rejects the narrative stance of existential realism even before its fashionable popularity in the novel by insisting on perpetuating time within time: in his choice of heroes and heroines-Hyperion, Apollo, Psyche, Moneta, Lamia-and in his choice of tales to tell, or rather to re-tell. He is, however, reconciled to Joyce and the modern preference</page><page sequence="16">636 KEATS'S NARRATIVES for the existential "now" in method if not in motive; he too must, like Stephen Daedalus, "recreate life out of life."'3 In The Eve of St. Agnes Keats chooses once again to re-tell or to recreate the legend out of his own re-enactment of the St. Agnes adventure. The "old ditty" which Porphyro will sing to his beloved is in the familiar mode of his creator who likewise prefers a winter's tale, an "old ditty" here as in the Hyperions, Isabella, Lamia, and Endymion. Keats provides a twofold base of legitimacy for his narrative: his tale gains credence from its long history of telling and from its conjuration on the eve of its annual re-telling. It is as if the re- telling of the Passover story (as Madeline has been told the tale of the Eve) is not enough to satisfy Keats-the Jews must be liberated once again. Keats thus probes the very heart of ritual as he tells his tale. The ambiguous nature of time in the narrative derives from the multiple meanings of "Eve" as a herald to ritual in the title and opening line, a word which connotes commemoration, recapitula- tion, and repetition, as well as anticipation and renewal. Is this a narrative of Madeline's "eve," of a tale told on another "eve" long past, or is the reader to imagine himself listening again to the tale, as Madeline and Porphyro did, on this another eve? It is, of course, all "eves," for "they are gone" (xlii. 1)-lovers and Barons, but so too Angela and the Beadsman, and so too the narrator, perhaps. The characters are all gone, and perhaps the tellers too, but the poem remains and lives so long as there exists a listener. Rather than arguing for the "transitoriness of all things human,"'" Keats dramatizes the persistence of human creativity in ritualistic recreation. Keats's fondness for the re-telling of old tales has a much more profound message to his readers than the image of a young artist flirting with the media of older poets, for this fondness is not confined to any one period of his poetic life nor to any one genre of poetic experimentation.'5 The rejuvenation of legend which Keats's reader experiences through his poetry should urge the reader to question any claim that Keats comes to argue finally that mutability prevents men from continuing to enjoy the same sensation.16 Keats's poetic practice in narrative poetry may be the antidote to his poetic theories which seem to permeate more openly his lyric poetry.

Moreover, as I have been attempting to demonstrate throughout this discussion, Keats's narratives are far wiser in narrative form than recognition of their imaginative "colouring" and thematic "drapery" allows.
