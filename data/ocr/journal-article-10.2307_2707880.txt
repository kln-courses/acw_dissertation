<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROCKER'S AGE OF CRISIS AN AGE OF CRISIS: Man and World in Eighteenth Century French Thought. By Lester G. Crocker. The Goucher College Series. Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press, 1959. Pp. xx, 495. $7.50. This first part of an extended work, which will ultimately consist of three volumes, is described by its author as "a synthetical study of French ethical thought during the Enlightenment." One may agree that the subject is of "crucial importance for the understanding of our cultural history," as well as for the comprehension of the eighteenth century itself. The avowed pur- pose of the author is to discover and describe the theory of the bases of judgment and conduct as set forth and implied in the writings of a consider- able group of Frenchmen of the period. The book does not come to grips with the development of scientific thought, nor is it anthropological in inter- est, although each of these interpretations could be permitted by the subtitle. The investigation as a whole may be summed up by the question, Is an Ethics possible, and if so, on what basis? Dr. Crocker's book has many virtues, and shows the result of patient and well-directed research carried on over a period of years on primary sources found in a number of the richer libraries. He has uncovered some two hundred authors from his century who have had something significant or at least typical to say on the subj ect of ethics; he has read, or at least scanned their works, selecting passages useful to his theme, and he has classified the collected material under appropriate rubrics. Here we have a really original effort to penetrate the surface of the age; the authors used, many, perhaps most, of them doubtless obscure even to scholars well read in the French XVIIIth century, are briefly characterized, and their general attitude on some of the controversial issues of the time indicated. It is prob- ably impossible to treat the value and influence of many of these books in depth, for they often are ephemeral, routine performances, with slight in- trinsic significance. Collectively, however, they tell us much about the period, and indicate the degree of seriousness attributed to the subject Dr. Crocker has undertaken to investigate. They illuminate the scattered passages where we are given a new look at Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot, or La Mettrie, in whom the progressive spirit of the century may be seen in active creation. The book is a monument to industry, to imaginative insight into the moral and social issues of the age, to a scholar's dream of what might be done with one of the major problems of an age in which he is a specialist. Still one may be excused for a degree of confusion about what this book is designed to achieve. It is placed in history, in the XVIIIth century, in France, among a considerable group of men, whose diversified writings throw some light on what they thought about ethics, human nature, and man's place in the universe. Yet the book is not about these men and the succession and processes of their thinking; practically no space is devoted to them as human beings, in historic time and geographic space, with their various private and social roles to play. This rather abstract treatment economizes space, of course, for the sophisticated reader replaces a recog- 121</page><page sequence="2">122 REVIEW nizable Voltaire or Rousseau in the unspecified context, and no great harm is done, except that certain quotations are taken from sources not generally known, which leaves a lingering doubt about what the author originally meant to say. But while there was no pressing need to develop the back- ground in the case of the well-known figures, this reader would like a little precise information about such challenging names as Para du Phanjas, Paulian, Chiniac, and Hoin, listed together on page 240, in order to appreci- ate their status as apologists with justice. The works of these four span some fifty years, from the mid-century to 1801, and with some fifty others who seem equally obscure, they offer a murky background for what is inevitably a substantial structure of ideas. The sheer mass of the material assembled by Dr. Crocker has given his book a plan and texture which do not easily lend themselves to accurate characterization. The book is concerned with the problem faced by the phi- losophes, who rejected traditional ethics, philosophical as well as theologi- cal, because these older systems could not be justified on scientific grounds, and who yet felt the need of a new basis for morals and socially useful con- duct. By profession, Dr. Crocker is a humanistic scholar; concerned with literature and its writers, with aesthetic qualities of books and polemical aspects of thought, his own philosophical position is undefined, and certainly not explicitly stated. Thus he is interested in writers in general, of all kinds, among whom all levels of intelligence are represented. Among the nearly two hundred Frenchmen there are found all shades of opinion, orthodox clergy, extreme radicals, deists, atheists, agnostics. Even more varied is the range of tone: wit, satire, obtuseness, pedantry, moralizing, sentimentalism, all occur to embarrass the reader and perhaps the author as well. While there has been some selective analysis of these quotations, and an impres- sion of the age has been created, it may be suggested that the chronology of the century might have been made a little clearer. Dates are not always given, contexts are not often indicated, and clues to tone and meaning are therefore lacking. But for a book of this type there is a high level of diver- sity, and benevolent imagination can make up for these deficiencies. While Dr. Crocker's argument as a whole is not revealed in this first volume, we are given enough to be able to surmise where he will finally lead us. Accepting the view, perhaps debatable, that the thought of the philoso- phes was destructive of ethical thinking, both by intention and in its effects, he deplores the loss of what he unfortunately calls the metaphysical "funda- ment" of values, a loss which led, in his view, to ethical confusion and un- certainty, emotional instability, and to social and moral chaos in the modern world. The "crisis" of his title is as much of our age as of the XVIIIth century, and we are expected to take it for granted, although a few specific and descriptive pages on it would have been a great aid to the reader. Our age, unhappily, is an age of crises, plural; which among them is intended by Dr. Crocker is not immediately clear, although we find it localized as we proceed.</page><page sequence="3">CROCKER'S AGE OF CRISIS 123 Of the three volumes planned, this one examines the "metaphysical and psychological assumptions and problems, the substructure and the building blocks prerequisite to ethical theory." In later volumes we are to have a "study of theories relating to the genesis of moral experience and the nature of moral judgments," and finally, an "analysis of ethical systems and value concepts evolved in an effort to solve the problems of the moral life." It is not clear whether the whole work is to be woven from the threads of XVIIIth-century thought, or whether the last two parts are to be general and theoretical, choosing their material wherever the author may be able to find it. Judgment of this volume may therefore be taken as tentative; what a reader may find to be lacking at present may perhaps be planned for in- clusion in a later section of the whole work. This first section consists of fourteen chapters and a conclusion, along with a bibliography of primary and secondary sources and an index. Un- fortunately for the reader in search of specific material on such figures as Voltaire, Vauvenargues, Turgot, or Volney, the index is incomplete; the end paper, pasted to the back cover, is p. 495 of the index, ending with "Tous- saint." As the discussion of different authors is dispersed in the various parts of the book, evaluation of comments on specific books is difficult at best, and Dr. Crocker's view of Voltaire in the circumstances is nearly impossible to reconstruct. The chapters of the book are grouped under three main heads; Man in the Universe, Freedom and Determinism, Human Nature and Motivation, roughly the physical world, the moral world, and psychology. Of these the last is longest, eight chapters, well over 200 pages. The method is analyti- cal; each chapter is largely composed of short passages chosen from many authors, arranged according to their bearing on the matter in hand. A single chapter, the ninth, on "Reason and the Passions," draws on about ninety authors, on the average two or three sentences from each, except for a fuller treatment of Rousseau just before the conclusion. The construction of the book, its materials, its method, are of importance in any attempt to evaluate its conclusions, or to estimate its utility as an aid to understanding the age it treats of. Behind its exterior of scholarly objectivity, one can glimpse a lively desire to come to grips with a night- mare of the XXth century, the Nazi terror of 1933-1945, to explain and describe the causes of the breakdown of ethics which that period revealed. Dr. Crocker's view is that the first stages of this catastrophe may be seen in the work of the philosophes and encyclopedists of the XVIIIth century, specifically in their failure to see and to remedy the ethical insufficiencies of their thought. While at one point he disclaims any desire to assert their responsibility, in his mind the fact that they could not, or at any rate did not, develop a complete and systematic metaphysical basis for their value judgments is a sufficient reason to describe the period as a disastrous turn- ing point in the thought and history of the West. The book, at least this volume, is therefore an exploration of a boundary region between two historical sequences. There is for its author the political</page><page sequence="4">124 REVIEW and social history to be explained; one is aware of his strong drives towards emotional revolt against the XXth century and its immense and perhaps insoluble problems. While Nazism is summoned up from time to time, the French Revolution is treated emphatically enough in the concluding section "Culminations," with the implication that there is a clear cause and effect relationship between the ideas of the XVIIIth century and the Terror: "C'est la faute 'a Voltaire!" The impression is inescapable that the book has been written, not entirely because the author wishes to study and under- stand the philosophes, whose thought and outlook are not adequately ac- counted for, but because a latent attitude drives him to explain what he does not like about today in terms of ideas, opinions, and sentiments which he wishes he could exorcise out of the pages of history. The reader is re- minded of this underlying outlook often enough to be on his guard in evalu- ating comments on historical causes and effects. If one historical sequence is political, the other is just as clearly in the realm of ideas, the movement of thought in the XVIIIth century and subse- quently. Here we mnust face the problems that men of that age faced and partially answered, seeking the development of the characteristic contribu- tion they made to the intellectual atmosphere of Europe. It is perhaps here that Dr. Crocker's concern with a highly specialized topic has led him to underrate certain basic concerns, and the way in which ideas from various fields may interact and cross-fertilize the activity of scholars and scientists. He describes many points of view, many attitudes towards his subject; but he offers no historical structure, is not apparently interested in one, finding that XVIIIth-century thought evolves "in concentric circles," that the age is characterized by "dynamic whirlpools" of discussion, in which he can find no rational sequence, not even in the biography of a single key figure, Vol- taire, for instance. One has the impression that he has plunged into the answers without regard for the questions, with the result that the century falls apart in his hands, the snippets of thought from here and there offering no reasonable or convincing figure of any single writer. The admitted orientation of the book towards a XXth-century crisis sug- gests that its historical outlook will range over a much larger area than the French XVIIIth century. Nazism and totalitarian thought in general were not specifically or predominantly French in aspect or origin; they grew in alien soil, and had many roots other than those which can be traced to XVIIIth-century scepticism, materialism, philosophie, sensibilite, anticleri- calism, etc. The dynamics of public events, to which Dr. Crocker refers in his pages where the French Revolution is briefly introduced, did not always move with reference to the history of ideas. Most of those whom Dr. Crocker cites were peaceful, tolerant, even timid, souls, who sought nothing more than untroubled quiet for themselves and their neighbors, a reasonable dis- tribution of the good things of the world, and a decent respect for diversity of opinions, without regard for ecclesiastical and philosophical doctrine. There were some whose sense of humor or ironic turn of mind led them to ,a degree of exaggeration, like La Mettrie or De Sade; others who never</page><page sequence="5">CROCKER'S AGE OF CRISIS 125 could get it into their heads that they really were not equipped for philoso- phy, like Voltaire; and still others who mistook adventures among careless females for an exploration of contemporary society, like Crebillon and Duclos. But there were really very few who could claim, as Dr. Crocker seems to suggest here and there, that they were offering in all seriousness a new outlook on ethics and the moral life. The concern of the XVIIIth century in France was with its present reali- ties rather than with speculative and abstract thought. The language itself suggests that manners, moeurs, were more important than a metaphysical basis for honnetete; there was, practically speaking, no word for what Dr. Crocker means by "ethics." Furthermore, such a writer as Voltaire never speaks of his deepest insights, his beliefs, his private philosophy; always his eye is on the public, on what he would like it to do, what it should think, what it should learn to cast aside. One can, if one chooses, psychoanalyze Candide or L'Ingenu, and perhaps one will produce a grain of truth about Voltaire, but it will be of small value in explaining his public role in the panorama of the century. And if one adds up the statements he may make about philosophy, one will find he has a whirligig of opinions, contradictory, inconsistent, structureless as a whole, but each of them profoundly relevant to a situation real enough at a given moment, in 1733, in 1750, or 1759, showing us an attitude in constant evolution, but not a man whose thought is progressing towards a final and perfected synthesis. All the scholar can do is isolate certain traits which recur in his work, hoping that these are bound up with his personality, presenting a consistent literary portrait. Most of the books on Voltaire as philosopher, on his systematic thinking-which is a phrase that would make him laugh-miss the mark, and reveal more of their writer than they do of Voltaire. As Norman Torrey pointed out in the thir- ties, it is the Spirit of Voltaire that we reckon with, not his metaphysics. One has the impression, then, that it is throwing sand against the wind to try to create an ethical philosophy from the writings of an age in which such a man is typical. Dr. Crocker valiantly lines up endless citations from his 200 authors, most of them new to all but the most ardent dix-huitiemiste, and each of his chapters ends with a conclusion which is largely negative in effect. This is what he expected, no doubt; the century had no interest in systematic ethics, its concerns were immediate and urgent, not remote and speculative; that it turned deliberately from finalism and first principles to means and near objectives is perhaps a philosophical catastrophe, but it is an event of prime importance historically. From this came, of course, the French Revolution and Robespierre, with to be sure their evil sides; but from it also came the idea that a constitution could be devised to protect liberties and human dignity rather than the rights of kings and clergy, and the idea that institutions need not be founded on supernatural privileges. The abuse of critical scepticism is no argument against its legitimate use. In any case, why should one try to make Voltaire into a philosopher? He was a man of action; every thoughtful word he uttered, every contact he cultivated, every move he made, was the result of a desire for positive good,</page><page sequence="6">126 REVIEW for himself sometimes, for his friends very often, most frequently for the good as he saw it of the world at large. He was no speculative thinker, no mystic, not even a seeker after the expression of ultimate truth. He did not seek understanding for understanding's sake, but for practical results, for use. Ideas pass through his works, he adds little to them, if he does not take much away from them; he uses them as weapons. They are not always de- formed as they pass through his hands; they are sometimes sharpened up, sometimes given a new direction, put into wider circulation. That he should have been taken seriously by some of his contemporaries is perfectly natu- ral, for ideas are always new to somebody, to a rising generation, but he should not, as Dr. Crocker suggests himself on p. 121, be taken for a crea- tive thinker and true philosopher. One is justified perhaps in asking whether books which attempt to probe the XVIIIth century should be written without a sure grasp of the essential features of science and of its history. The background of the ideas discussed, of such themes as the limited place of man in an expanding universe, the rejection of final causes as explanations, the rejection of anthropomorphism in the concepts of order and beauty, the necessity of assuring a mechanical pattern for living phenomena-the background of all these views lies essen- tially in the scientific revolution and not in any frivolous or merely rebel- lious anti-Christian spirit. The scientists were not all aware of, or even interested in, the moral implications of what they were doing; but many of them understood that they had the makings of an intellectual revolution in their hands, and this awareness penetrated the writings of the popularizers, even though often diluted and distorted. Voltaire may not have been either a notable scientist nor yet a metaphysician, but when his Micromegas left a blank book in the hands of the French academicians, Voltaire and his hero both knew very well what was implied. The work of discovering a meaning was still to be achieved. It would be essential in writing the history of the origins of the moral crisis of the modern world to distinguish between those authors who saw the implications of their negation of metaphysics, and accepted them, and those who did not. In this connection, Dr. Crocker writes at one point (p. 6), that the "new science of Galileo and of Newton ... had no use for final causes and simply excluded them." He offers no explanation of this, does not say why this ex- clusion took place nor what the attitude implies, although an answer could have told him much about the century he studies, and explained a good deal that is hard to understand in connection with the ethical problems of his investigation. Final causes are not excluded from the universe by science or the scientist; they may very well exist, but the scientist does not interest himself in finding them, nor can he use the hypothesis as a means to dis- covery. His interest is in how a sequence of events takes place, what factors are measurably active and present, what happens to these factors, and what the total result is, in terms of material state, mass, position, temperature, etc. The causes he can utilize are measurable: physical, chemical, singly or in combination, as in the life sciences; the notion of purpose, being im-</page><page sequence="7">CROCKER S AGE OF CRISIS 127 ponderable, unmeasurable, is irrelevant and only confuses his task. The question may be asked after the research into the process is complete; it may be used by the philosopher or the theologian as an explanation of why the process occurred, but it has no value while the objective and impersonal study of the phenomena are under way. Such attributes of natural objects and phenomena as aesthetic order and beauty are qualities in the observer's mind rather than in the objects themselves; they tell the scientist something about the observer, nothing about the process which has produced the object. The understanding of life processes has advanced by the assumption that the sequence is self-contained, self-organizing, not subject to external inter- vention from a different class of events; that, in short, it is subject to the same regularities as a complete and self-sustaining machine. This view of process, in unwary hands, can, of course, contribute to the development of a harsh and thoughtless outlook on life, subject to purposes which are not ethically good and productive of suffering and evil. But it should be remembered that the exclusion of moral purpose in the analysis of phenomena does not necessarily involve its exclusion on the level of par- ticipation in the process by which phenomena are produced. Quite the con- trary; active and creative involvement in phenomena implies a much greater responsibility for what is done than a view which asserts that the final cause for which a sequence appears to be organized is the product of a super- natural will over which the individual has no real control. Properly under- stood, a world of science and technological skill demands more ethical understanding than a primitive, or pre-scientific, world of occult powers and remote final causes. These comments may be made clear by reference to one scientist of the XVIIIth century on whom the book is not as fair and even as accurate as it should be, the nuances of whose thought are not accounted for. La Mettrie's place as an extreme example of XVIIIth-century materialism is clearly indi- cated, although the picture given of his work lacks subtlety and is incom- plete, neglecting the manner in which he directs his attention to causes, to basic drives in viewing man. In Sur le Bonheur he says, "Mon but est de raisonner et d'aller aux causes, en faisant abstraction des consequences, qui cependant n'en seront ni plus facheuses, ni plus difficiles a reprimer," after he has put the case against man, "Qu'on ne dise point que j'invite au crime; car je n'invite qu'au repos dans le crime. L'homme paroit en general un animal faux, ruse, dangereux, perfide, etc., il semble suivre plutot la fougue du sang et des passions, que les idees qu'il a regues des 1'enfance et qui sont la base de la loi naturelle et des remords." Passages such as this, and they are innumerable, tend to show La Mettrie as an ironic and witty moraliste in the usual sense of the French word, an observer in the tradition of La Rochefoucauld, with the added advantage of training in philosophy and science. He knew exactly what he was doing, and realized fully the importance of his ideas, the possible results of his method of analysis. Before castigating him for immorality, his thought should be related to the tradition in which it was developed. He deliberately neglects</page><page sequence="8">128 REVIEW the ethical consequences of his findings in the interests of ethics itself; with his maligned century, he saw clearly that the essential elements of a new ethics, which the age needed, could only be based on adequate knowledge of the mechanisms of behavior, described in language suited to the new out- look on events in the external world. When La Mettrie writes that crime is punished by remorse, virtue rewarded by the approval of conscience, Dr. Crocker comments that this is a limited empirical judgment, and that, in the eyes of La Mettrie, "such reactions are unnecessary prejudices, harmful to happiness." That La Mettrie could be saying what to him was the simple psychological truth, that lie was recording a normal sequence introspec- tively observed, may have been apparent, but a systematic view prevents Dr. Crocker from pointing it out. One must allow an author the exercise of intelligent choice in applying or rejecting ethical comment when he records what has actually happened; one cannot write a history of ethical thought by including those who had no intention of introducing ethical categories. Perhaps a comment made by A. R. Hall, in his book on The Scientific Revo- lution (Boston, 1958, p. 293), is relevant here: "Most of the major advances of science have, in one way or another, imperilled the comfortable security of the popular understanding." It is typical of the Greco-Christian west, and of the XVIIlth century in particular, that it finds for its intellectual problems solutions which differ radically in their assumptions and methods, and pushes each of them to an extreme point. Thus it does not seem appropriate to criticize a western thinker because he does not hesitate before a paradox. As La Mettrie puts it, "Un ecrivain timide et circonspect ne servant ni les sciences, ni l'esprit humain, ni la patrie, se met lui-meme des entraves qui l'empechent de se'elever; c'est un coureur dont les souliers ont une semelle de plomb, ou un nageur qui met des vessies pleines d'eau sous ses aisselles. Il faut qu'un phi- losophe ecrive avec une noble hardiesse, ou qu'il s'attende a ramper comme ceux qui ne le sont pas" (Discours preliminaire du Traite de l'Ame, Oeuvres [Berlin, 1775], I, 52). The books of the century must be read with this general attitude in mind. The complete breakdown of the system of privileges and permissions, which had kept all printed matter within narrow bounds of moral and theo- logical propriety, had led naturally to an outburst of writing in many fields and styles, less the expression of a uniform public taste than a revelation of what was taking place in the thinking of a large number of highly diversi- fied individuals. A good example may be found in Voltaire's Princesse de Babylone (1769), a tale of oriental fantasy and political realism, where paradox succeeds paradox with great rapidity, which touches most of the author's usual themes, with his accustomed power of creating a sense of novelty by sheer style. The tale ends appropriately enough on a note of action against the Inquisition and the interference of church with state and people in Spain; while moral judgments are plentiful, so that one could per- haps derive a general moral position or at least a group of related judgments from the tale, it is doubtful if one could build an ethical system from it, or</page><page sequence="9">CROCKER' S AGE OF CRISIS 129 account for the individual statements except by saying that there is an in- tuitive sense which tells us that suffering and slavery are bad, that selfish- ness must be stamped out, that the good man acts for the happiness of all, himself included. Values of this sort are not much talked about by Dr. Crocker, who seeks another aspect of the ethical process, the metaphysical basis. The larger question of what the XVIIIth century actually respected is hinted at, but not discussed in An Age of Crisis. A chapter such as that in which Candide visits the noble Signor Pococurante in his palazzo on the Brenta would be instructive in showing the jaded state of some XVIIIth- century palates. Voltaire can hardly be said to be portraying himself in these blase pages, where all the pleasures have gone sour, and there is no delight left for the amateur of the arts, of music, literature, science, phi- losophy, or even women. From other evidence it can be guessed that Voltaire was of a different mood; the author of Candide had another purpose in the later chapters of this book, and here he is preparing the climax of the tale, the well known motto, "II faut cultiver notre jardin." Pococurante culti- vates no garden, his judgment is warped, simply because he has no recog- nizable point of view, because he is a disinterested, even uninterested ob- server. He is so entirely objective that he can see no value anywhere; so remote from the contingent that life has no moral or aesthetic meaning left. He was of his century in so far as that age was a time for taking stock, for reviewing the past, for the writing and meditating of human history. For some, as for the Senator on the Brenta, that history was dust and ashes; for others, it was the opening of a new age, with new occasions for useful and creative endeavor, a garden to be cultivated. This sense of a new world opening for those who were young enough to profit by it is plain enough in another old man's book, the Reveries du Promeneur Solitaire. Rousseau's pages are full of the sense of a world which has collapsed around him, a world which he can no longer enjoy except in retrospect; the new vision comes in the Fifth Promenade, whose lyrical quality, with its exalted awareness of the self in nature, alone, existing in duration rather than in moments, cannot hide from the reader the absence of ethical judgment, of moral sense, which pervades the whole sequence. Here all is sentiment in the old sense of the word, in Pascal's sense: immedi- ate perception, spontaneous analysis without preconceived standards, of the random content of the mind. The ingrained habit of ethical evaluation, which Rousseau had learned so well in Geneva, and which runs like a thread through all his earlier work so that he can never avoid pointing out what an ethical judgment would be when the occasion calls for it, this old habit has gone, and we are left with an essential Rousseau, a Rousseau who feels and vibrates, who uses the language of ethics, but has forgotten its meaning in the sheer musical values of the images and ancient feelings the words revive in him. Having passed beyond morals as a guide to life, Rousseau and Voltaire, in the Reveries and in the Princesse de Babylone, agree that a sense of im- mediate fitness, a spontaneous reaction to situations, an open and receptive</page><page sequence="10">130 REVIEW outlook on the world and on its ways and judgments, acting by intuitive responses rather than by a priori systematic evaluations, lead more surely to happiness and the well-being of society in general. This would be the sum of what that century called wisdom; it can be used with justice freely only by those who are old and wise enough to do others no harm. The evil that it may lead to is in those who have not yet matured in wisdom, who judge by intuitive standards without roots and depth in their private experience. From this point of view, Dr. Crocker's insistence on de Sade as the terminus of the century does not seem to make sense. Possibly the Marquis does push materialism to its limits; possibly there is no point beyond his reduction of morals to nihilism. The question remains, is the extreme limit of XVIIIth-century ethics to be found in the intuitive and unsystematic wisdom of Voltaire and Rousseau, or in the paradoxical and ironic mockery which is the essence of Choderlos de Laclos and the Marquis de Sade? For this reader, the XVIIIth century was an age with a social sense, moved by desires to improve the human condition, a humanitarian age, for which philosophy, even la saine philosophie, was but a means, not an end. In the heart of the preoccupations of the philosophes was humanity, with its constant anxieties and its very real inequities. Abstract ethics was of less importance than the morality of ordinary business; as long as common sense was satisfied by fair play, by tolerance, by a judicious scepticism about absolutes, the philosophes felt no great need for a completely developed sys- tem of abstract thought. Voltaire's metaphysics was sketchy, but it was all he needed; his real views on such matters are in his poem on Les Systemes, and in the deliberately inconclusive and unconcluded conversations in Can- dide. Dr. Crocker refers justly to Condillac as the only systematic thinker among the group; it is hardly fair to expect a coterie, for one reason or an- other critical of contemporary conditions, whose work takes the most diverse forms, though moved by a single consistent purpose, the destruction of the evils of the old regime, to work out as a chief necessity a systematic pattern of philosophical ethics. They were concerned with implications, but these were not remote. They had learned how difficult it was to prescribe for a future subject to social forces-including political, economic, technological factors as well-whose power and direction were incalculable and unidenti- fied. That the old way of thinking about ethics was inadequate was clear; that its weakness was its metaphysical basis was probable. A new way should begin by serving immediate ends; if this were sufficient to promote even a degree of human happiness, then much would have been achieved. Let new generations work out ethics for their own conditions; the direction of the thought mattered more than the precise formulation. It would suffice if a standard had been set by which the value judgments of later ages could themselves be appraised. HARCOURT BROWN Brown University.</page></plain_text>
