Willett,1,3,5 Isaac Schiff* Marie Francis,4 Christopher Longscope,6,1 and Sonja M. McKinlay8 We evaluated the influence of dietary, anthropomorphic, and hormonal factors on bone density in a cross-sectional sample of 281 pre- and perimenopausal women age 50-60 years living in Massachusetts. The sample included only women who had intact ovaries and were not currently using estrogen. Information on diet was obtained through a semi- quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We measured bone density using single-photon absorptiometry in the non- dominant arm in two sites: the midshaft and the ultradistal radius. We observed no important associations between mid? shaft bone density and dietary variables but found linear relations between ultradistal radius bone density and body mass index [b = 1.10 gm/cm2 per kg/m2, standard error (SE) = 0.56], follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (b = ?0.36 gm/ cm2 per IU/liter, SE = 0.15), and several nutrients: calcium (b = 0.012 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.007), retinol (b = 0.002 gm/cm2 per IU/day, SE = 0.0008), vitamin C (b = 0.025 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.013), and vitamin D (b = 0,040 gm/cm2 per IU/day, SE = 0.018). We could not clearly distinguish the independent contribution of these micronu- trients, however, because many were commonly ingested together in the form of supplements. Caffeine was inverseiy associated with bone density (b = -0.035, SE = 0.017) independent of dietary, anthropometric, and hormonal fac? tors. Analyses of individual caffeinated beverages revealed consistent inverse associations for coffee (b = ?3.42 gm/cm2 per cups/day, SE = 1.49), tea (b = -2.85 gm/cm2 per cups/ day, SE = 1.56), and caffeinated cola (b = ?0.14 gm/cm2 per cans/day, SE = 0.06), but not for decaffeinated coffee or decaffeinated cola. These data indicate that caffeine may be an important determinant of bone density. (Epidemiology 1993;4:128-134) Keywords: bone density, menopause, caffeine, diet, osteoporosis, hormones.

Thus, any effect of caffeine on bone density would have large public health implications. In this report, we explore the relation between caffeine intake and bone density, taking into account potential confounding factors including obesity, en- dogenous levels of sex hormones, and daily intake of calcium, alcohol, and other nutrients. Methods Study Population The study population is a subset of a previously de? scribed larger cohort, the Massachusetts Women's Health Study.22 Briefly, the larger cohort consists of 2,570 women born in the interval between 1926 and 1936 who resided in Massachusetts as of January 1981</page><page sequence="2">CAFFEINE AND BONE DENSITY AMONG WOMEN and were still menstruating in 1981-1982. The Mas? sachusetts cities and towns included in the study were selected using a two-stage cluster sampling design, stratified by population, median per capita income, and percentage of black population. The present study included only women who resided in Eastern Massa? chusetts, whose uterus and ovaries were intact, who were not currently using estrogen replacement therapy in any form, and who had not yet had 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Data Collection We scheduled interviews at home in the morning (from 7 to 11 am), between days 2 and 10 of menses (if regularly menstruating) for 427 women age 50-60 years, between October 1986 and January 1988. All participants read and signed informed consent forms. The field technician administered a short question? naire focusing on medications, medical conditions, parity, physical activity, smoking history, and alcohol consumption. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standardized protocols.23 The techni- cians drew two blood samples 30 minutes apart for endocrine analyses. Hormone Measurements Estrone and estradiol were measured after solvent extraction, using Celite chromatography and specific radioimmunoassays. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured in serum by a double antibody technique (Ciba Corning, Waltham, MA).24,25 Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was determined using a solid phase radioim- munometric method (Farmos Diagnostica, Oulonsalo, Finland). Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay. All intraassay coefficients of variation were less than 8% and all interassay coefficients of variation were less than 11 % from routine laboratory quality control pro? cedures. Bone Density Studies We measured bone density at Brigham and Women's Hospital using a Lunar Radiation Corporation single- photon (SP2) scanner. The SP2 scanner, which assesses axial bone, uses 125I as the radioactive source. The source is replaced every fourth month. The measure for bone mineral density is expressed in grams per square centimeter. We determined bone mineral content of the distal and proximal sites of the radius on the nondominant arm, except in women who had prior fractures in that arm, as described by Yano et al.16 The distal forearm Epidemiology March 1993, Volume 4 Number 2 was examined over a 2-cm interval beginning at the separation of the radius and ulna. The proximal fore- arm scan was performed at the junction of the distal and middle third of the ulnar length. To minimize positional errors, the arm was bent at a 90 degree angle, and the forearm was placed on a flat surface and positioned with a measuring tape. The arm was wrapped in a gel bolus, which provided a constant thickness, eliminating problems in measurement due to differences in soft tissue mass. Routine daily quality control included scanning an encased standard of bone substitute to maintain accu? rate and reproducible results. Both the midshaft (largely cortical bone) and ultradistal (mostly trabecular bone) scans were run as recommended by Lunar and analyzed according to their recommendations, as listed in the Lunar Radiation SP2 User Manual.27 At both sites, we measured the bone mineral content and bone width and calculated bone density as bone mineral content per square centimeter of bone width. The coefficient of variation was &lt;2.5% for the midshaft and &lt;5.0% for the ultradistal site. One nuclear tech- nologist completed all scans on a single dedicated machine. Dietary Variables We obtained information on dietary habits using a previously validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire listing 116 foods.28,29 For each food, a commonly used portion size was specified, and study participants were asked how often, on the average, they had consumed the specified amount of each food during the last year. There were nine possible re? sponses, which ranged from never or almost never to six or more times per day. We obtained additional details about the amount and type of vitamin supple- ments used. We calculated nutrient intake by multi- plying the nutrient content of each specific food item by its frequency of intake and summing over the foods. We adjusted all nutrients for caloric intake to provide information in the context of dietary composition and to avoid confounding due to the positive association between energy intake and physical activity, which may itself increase bone density.30 Statistical Analysis To assess the strength of the association of nutrients, foods, and hormone levels with bone density measure- ments, we used multiple linear regression models and Spearman rank correlation coefficients. All analyses were performed using the SAS Statistical Analysis System.31 Because some authors32 have suggested that 129</page><page sequence="3">HERNANDEZ-AVILA ET AL the effect of caffeine could be restricted to women with low calcium intake, we analyzed those women with low calcium intake (&lt;600 mg) and those with moderate intake (&gt;600 mg), separately as well as com? bined. All variables were included in natural scale, and coefficients were multiplied by 103. Results Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics of study par? ticipants for bone density measurement, age, body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters to the second power), hormone levels, and other vari? ables as well as their regression coefficients with bone density measurements. The two measurements of bone density were moderately correlated [r = 0.23; b = 0.277, standard error (SE)= 0.06]. Ultradistal radius bone density (UDBD) was positively associated with body mass index (b = 1.10 gm/cm2 per kg/m2, SE = 0.56), but inversely associated with FSH (r = ?0.14; b = -0.36 gm/cm2 per IU/liter, SE = 0.15). Age was not materially associated with ultradistal radius bone den? sity. For the midshaft bone density, the only meaning- ful predictors were age, which was inversely associated with UDBD (b = -5.59 gm/cm2 per year, SE = 2.19), and height, which was positively associated with UDBD (b = 2.73 gm/cm2 per cm, SE = 0.53). Dietary Variables Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations (SD) for usual intake of several calorie-adjusted nu? trients of a priori interest among study participants and regression analysis with ultradistal bone density. The mean dietary calcium was 745 mg per day, and 909 mg per day when supplements were taken into account (14% of participants were currently taking calcium supplements). Dietary calcium was weakly cor- related with UDBD, and when supplements were in? cluded, the association was slightly stronger (r = 0.13; b = 0.012 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.007). This positive association between calcium intake and UDBD increased after adjustment for age, FSH, LH, smoking, and body mass index (b = 0.016 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.009). Neither protein nor phosphorus intake was associ? ated with bone density. Dietary fiber was positively associated with UDBD; adjustment for other variables further strengthened this relation (b = 0.875 gm/cm2 per gm/day, SE = 0.69). Vegetable fat was inversely associated with UDBD (b = ?0.529 gm/cm2 per gm/ day, SE = 0.23); this inverse association remained after controlling for other variables in multivariate models (b = -1.02 gm/cm2 per gm/day, SE = 0.358). Retinol, preformed vitamin A, vitamin D, and vita? min C were all positively associated with UDBD. All of these associations were very weak unless supple? ments were included in the calculation of intake (Table 2). Women who used multivitamins had higher values of UDBD (mean = 0.349 gm/cm2) than those who did not (mean = 0.329 gm/cm2). Because of the high correlation among the nutrients included in multivi? tamins, we could not distinguish which nutrients were responsible for this association. Addition of supple? ment use as an indicator variable markedly attenuated the associations between bone density and calcium or specific vitamins. The mean alcohol intake was 6.5 gm per day; 67 TABLE 1.

Alcohol was not an important predictor of either measure of bone density. We also examined the effect of beer, wine, and liquor separately and observed similar re? sults. Caffeine Intake The mean intake of caffeine was 316 mg per day, approximately equivalent to 2.5 cups of coffee per day. Caffeine was inversely correlated with UDBD (r = -0.18; b = -0.035 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.017; see Figure 1), and this association remained after ad? justment for several other variables including dietary calcium and those listed in the footnote to Table 2 (r = -0.21; b = -0.037 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.01). We also modeled caffeine intake as a categorical vari? able divided into quartiles. We compared those women with a low consumption of caffeine (mean daily intake 69 mg per day, SD = 41) with those who consumed 224 (SD = 66), 374 (SD = 20.3), and 602 (SD = 127) mg per day. The adjusted mean differences in bone density were -0.012 gm/cm2 (SE = 0.01), -0.031 gm/ cm2 (SE = 0.009), and -0.026 gm/cm2 (SE = 0.01), respectively. The slope for linear trend across quartiles was b = -0.010, SE = 0.003. When individual bever? ages with different caffeine contents were analyzed separately, we observed a consistent inverse association Epidemiology March 1993, Volume 4 Number 2 between foods with high levels of caffeine and UDBD (Table 3). The observed associations were: coffee (r = -0.16; b = -3.43 gm/cm2 per cups/day, SE = 1.49), tea (r = ?0.11; b = -2.85 gm/cm2 per cups/day, SE = ULTRADISTAL RADIUS BONE DENSITY gms/cm2 200 400 600 800 1000 FIGURE 1.

In contrast, a positive association was observed between UDBD and decaf- feinated coffee (r = 0.14; b = 2.14 gm/cm2 per cups/ day, SE = 1.56); however, this association was reduced after adjustment for other variables. We observed similar results after stratification ac? cording to daily calcium intakes. The observed Spear- man correlations between bone density and caffeine intake were r = ?0.16; b = ?0.024 gm/cm2 per mg/ day, SE = 0.036, for those women with a daily intake below 600 mg and r = -0.20; b = ?0.051 gm/cm2 per mg/day, SE = 0.002, for those women with intakes above 600 mg. No relation was observed between caffeine intake and midshaft density. Discussion In this cross-sectional study, we observed an inverse linear association between intake of caffeine and ul? tradistal radius bone density among perimenopausal women. Consumption of specific beverages containing caffeine was also consistently associated inversely with ultradistal bone density. Intakes of calcium and several vitamins were positively associated with ultradistal bone density, whereas vegetable fat was inversely re? lated. In contrast, no material associations were ob? served between midshaft bone density and dietary variables. Considerable amounts of caffeine are regularly con? sumed from dietary sources (coffee, tea, and cola bev? erages) and from nonprescription drugs, such as over- the-counter analgesics.21,33,34 Caffeine has a calciuretic 132 effect,35 and high urinary excretion of calcium could promote a negative balance when ingestion and ab- sorption of calcium are low. Heaney and Recker36 observed an inverse association between calcium bal? ance and caffeine intake in healthy premenopausal women. Other investigators observed similar results using different experimental designs.37-40 Animal ex- periments that have examined the effect of caffeine on bone density have yielded conflicting results.41,42 The relation between caffeine intake and osteopo? rosis has been evaluated in several other studies. Daniell8 reported a high caffeine intake in osteoporotic subjects as compared with age-matched controls, but this association was no longer present after stratifica? tion by smoking habit. Yano et al19 also observed an inverse correlation between caffeine and bone density. Other investigators, however, conducting smaller stud? ies, failed to find important correlations between caf? feine (or coffee) intake and osteoporosis. Slemenda et al43 examined several predictors of bone loss among 84 peri- and postmenopausal women and reported that caffeine was not a significant predictor. Eliel et al44 reported similar results in a sample of 86 normal volunteers age 24-60 years, who were followed for an average of 2.5 years. Recently, Picard et al45 reported a weak positive association between caffeine intake and bone mineral content of the forearm (r = 0.10) in a sample of 183 premenopausal women age 40-50 years. Many of the studies did not include details on sources of caffeine in the diet that might lead to misclassification that would attenuate any true associ? ation. Moreover, many of the studies were too small to exclude an important association with coffee or caffeine intake. We have documented the reproduci- bility and validity of coffee consumption evaluated with our questionnaire. Coffee consumption was highly correlated with coffee consumption measured 2 years (r = 0.65) and 6 years previously (r = 0.60), using the same instrument. Coffee consumption was also highly correlated (r = 0.78) with measurements made using a 4-week diet record. Our estimate of caffeine intake is not perfect, but errors in measuring caffeine will tend to decrease the magnitude of the effect of caffeine, which would imply that the observed association in our study could be an underestimate of the real effect. If the effect on bone density that we observed is confirmed, this will carry important public health im? plications. Although the magnitude of the association was only modest (?0.037 gm/cm2 per 1,000 mg of caffeine daily, after adjustment for other factors), it is important because the majority of adults regularly consume caffeine. Epidemiology March 1993, Volume 4 Number 2</page><page sequence="6">CAFFEINE AND BONE DENSITY AMONG WOMEN Our data are compatible with those observed in two long-term follow-up studies. Kiel et al20 reported an increase in the risk of fractures for those consuming high quantities of caffeine in the Framingham study but did not consider calcium intake. A daily intake of 3 or more cups of coffee was associated with a substan? tial increase (85%) in the risk of hip fracture. Similar observations have been reported from the Nurses' Health Study, which did assess and adjust for calcium intake.46 Our study provides some modest support for the hypothesis that calcium intake is a minor determinant of bone density. The relation between calcium intake and bone density has been extensively studied, but it remains controversial.14"18 In most studies, only a weak association has been observed. Vitamin C was positively associated with UDBD, but only very weakly after adjustment for vitamin supplement use. Freudenheim et al*7 reported positive correlations between ulnar bone density and vitamin C both in a cross-sectional sample and in longitudinal follow-up. Some inconsistencies have also been re? ported.19,47,48 It is possible this finding may reflect some other differences between vitamin supplement users and nonusers, The observation that body mass index was positively associated with bone density has been reported by other investigators8,11,45 and suggests that obesity plays a protective role in the occurrence of fractures. It is postulated that the effect of obesity could be mediated mechanically (reduced impact) or could be attributable to hormonal changes. Circulating estrone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels as well as peripheral conversion of androstenedione are reduced in slender women in comparison to obese subjects.49"51 In our study, body mass index was inversely associated with sex hormone-binding globulin, FSH, and LH, supporting the view that the protective effect is me? diated, at least in part, via hormonal changes. Single-photon absorptiometry is a valid and precise technique for assessing bone density.52,53 Skeletal mass represents the cumulative effect of genetic, environ? mental, and life-style factors. Our study is limited to evaluating these factors cross-sectionally; for example, specific nutrient intake that occurred years or decades before may be more important than current diet. Trabecular bone is subject to more rapid turnover and remodeling than cortical bone.54,55 Our cross- sectional findings of stronger associations of dietary and hormonal factors with ultradistal bone density (largely representing trabecular bone) than with corti? cal bone density are thus not surprising, because its Epidemiology March 1993, Volume 4 Number 2 active metabolism leads to early changes in response to environmental variables. Furthermore, we found the standard deviation for ultradistal bone density to be twice that of midshaft bone density (see Table 1); the greater variation among subjects for the ultradistal site may increase the possibility for detecting associa? tions with diet and other environmental factors.
