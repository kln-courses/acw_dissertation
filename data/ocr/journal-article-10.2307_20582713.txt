<plain_text><page sequence="1">P O E T R Y: A Magazine of Verse NEW TRENDS IN SOVIET RUSSIAN POETRY HE GREAT Russian poets of the pre-revolutionary years, the revolution itself and the brief period of transition which followed it, were Alexander Blok, Sergei Essenin, Vladimir Maiakovsky and Boris Pasternak. Our knowledge of sovietic poetry, in the West, is almost exclusively limited to the work of these four; yet they were all mature artists before the revo lution began. Blok died in 1921, Essenin in 1925, Maiakovsky in 1930; Pasternak alone, of these whom Russians already con sider classics, is still alive. In a way, too, they are already out moded, Maiakovsky perhaps more than the other two who died before him. Their poetry bears the mark of a conduded era which iprepared the revolution, achieved it and then had to adjust itself to new conditions. Is there already a truly post revolutionary poetry in Russia, any literature which has been entirely conditioned and formed by the new order? Among more recent Soviet poets none can be compared to the four great poets of the preceding generation. Poetry, in Russia, has either tended to stress its unpoetic elements and con tents or to develop vaster and more all-embracing literary forms; the lyric has thus been abandoned in favor of the versified novel (Kirsanov, Selvinsky), the folkloristic allegory, legend or fairy tale (Tvardovsky, Svetlov), or the verse-drama (Selvinsky). The legendary allegory or fairy-tale, of course, preserves the most obviously lyrical character. Yet lyricism, which was so typical of Russian literature of all times, has lost ground in the past fifteen years. Feeling and thought are now more often expressed in neo-realistic novels. The development of Soviet literature falls, as we see it today, 324</page><page sequence="2">New Trends in Soviet Russian Poetry in three distinct periods. First, the period of destruction, an immediate emanation of the revolution itself; then the return towards the reality of experience, during the first years of social ist reconstruction; finally, a search for synthetic neo-realism, expressing utopian tendencies, as a revolt against the earlier photographic realism,, which had proved unsatisfactory. This third period represents an attempt to combine synthetically the achievements of the two earlier periods. If this attempt suc ceeds, it will prove that literature, although subjected to rigidly unartistic or antiartistic principles, is stil necessary enough, to Russian life and life in any community, to survive even the most unfavorable disciplines. The first period, of destruction of old forms, social or artistic, and of great hope for the immediate birth of a completely new and better order, was a great age of poetry, enthusiastically hopeful songs, revolutionary drunkenness and eccentricity, uto pian slogans, epically conceived programs. While the novel lost all its flesh and blood, the lyric, anarchic or programmatic, rose to unprecedented heights. There were suddenly hundreds of poets; but Blok, Essenin, Maiakovsky and Pasternak illustrate the most important tendencies of this turbulent age. Blok, the symbolist, subtle representative of the old "intelli gentsia," poet of undertones, the delicate reactions and impres sions of a supersensitive and almost bodiless soul, was over whelmed by the Revolution and broken by it. Yet his great poem, The Twelve, is certainly the most powerful poetic expres sion of the Revolution itself. His conception of the event was anarchic and romantic: he saw only the destruction of the old order and proclaimed its necessity. Essenin, blue-eyed peasant poet, also saw this destruction. 325</page><page sequence="3">PO ET R Y: A Magazine of Verse But he always felt that this was his element, since it brought hope to the peasants. Whether or not the ruin of his hope was the cause of his suicide need not be discussed here. In his time, Essenin was the most lyrical of all, because he could express himself only lyrically. He neither created a school nor did he belong to one; but all the peasant poets of today are his fol lowers, though they never rise to his heights. Maiakovsky, the hero, the antithesis of Blok and Essenin, created endless slogans for the Revolution, expanded his tre mendous ego beyond all possible limits. He preached the future order and thought he was being active in its construction. Pasternak is the poet of the old "intelligentsia" who has sur vived the Revolution and adapted himself to the new order. Thoroughly Western, he belongs, in spite of the undeniable influence of the Revolution on his emotional outlook and his work, to the history of modern European poetry, such as it has been since 1900. He is, in many respects, closer to Rilke than to many of his colleagues in Soviet Russia. A rapid sociological analysis of contemporary Russian poetry reveals three distinct groups, very exactly determined: the so called proletarian poets, the "poputciki" or fellow-travelers, the bourgeois poets. The largest of these is the proletarian group, whose general attitude is characterized by a lack of any ultimate problems since, to the orthodox, the Revolution has solved all problems, iartistic as well as sociological. These poets are in variably and monotonously enthusiastic about everything that is being accomplished in the most perfect of all worlds. Kirilov, Alexandrovsky, Kasin, the oldest of this group, and also a whole army of younger poets, all have their ideological roots, of course, in the first period of action and enthusiasm. But how long 326</page><page sequence="4">New Trends in Soviet Rgssian Poetry can one live on this? Too much cheap accordion-music, whether in village or in factory-yard, and too little human reality, have come of it. Human reality cannot be expressed in basic lyrical emotions, those of a cloudless, shadowless and problemless world. All the too-happy love-lyrics of the proletarian school are dull. The poetry of the village and of the factory has all faded away, except when it has remained purely lyrical and faithful to old literary forms. Indeed, the reality of life, in Soviet Russia, has been proved to be more complex than the proletarian poets would lead us to believe. We find an adequate reflection of this complexity in the very interesting development of the neo-realistic novel. Still, there was talent among the proletarians. The most inter esting of them is probably Alexander Tvardovsky, a peasant who represents some new tendencies, simple and lyrical, with a new simplicity, that of folklore. A true poet, he cannot remain unproblematic. He is the poet of the collective farm; his major work, a sort of allegorical legend developed as an epic, The Land Muravia (1937), shows the conflict between two generations of peasants, the old man still dreaming of his own piece of land and the new generation which is born to live and work in the Kolhoz. In spite of its fairy-tale forml and ready-made happy ending, when the naive dreamer and individualist finds his way to the kolhoz, Tvardovsky's poem reveals a great feeling for the reality of the Russian peasant's life. Creating with love and tenderness his "mujicok" Morgunok, the poet yet sees him without false sentimentality, idealizing not the individual but 1Harmonica, a Soviet movie shown in this country some five years ago, illustrates well how fairy-tale, the legend and the folklore allegory, in another artistic medium, have been adapted to serve the new Soviet order. 327</page><page sequence="5">PO ET R Y: A Magazine of Verse his unconscious, overwhelming, humanly beautiful and humble love of work. When Tvardovsky describes the century-old and unaltered toil of the peasant, he is at his best; also where, through the unfalsified naivete of Morgunok, the dreamer seek ing his humble peasant paradise of Muravia, he sees nature. The earth, endless yet limited, warm and black, "crumbling like a piece of cake," is the true hero of The Land Muravia. Without his love of the earth and of the Russian soil, Mor gunok would not exist, just as he would not be himself with out his passionate devotion to his gray horse. The earth, She runs and runs A thousand miles ahead; The skylark trembles over her And sings of her. The earth, More beautiful and more to see, She lays around; There is no happiness more great Than to live on her until you die. The earth, To the West and East And North and South. . . Morgunok wants to fall down and embrace her But his arms are too short . . . In this Russian Whitmanism, derived to a great extent from Tolstoi, one discovers the taste and the color, the very pattern of the new and strong patriotism which has been developed in literature by the proletarian school. As a whole, it is a new trend in Russian literature, and Tvardovsky expresses it in his poetry. The second group, and the most important, is that of the fel low-travelers, who do not create a bridge between two extreme groups, proletarian and bourgeois, but are rather very eager to 328</page><page sequence="6">New Trends in Soviet Russian Poetry disconnect themselves from the bourgeois group. Oceans of criticism have been devoted to the fellow-travelers, first to define the term, then to place poets in this category and thereby de grade them. From the orthodox point of view, "fellow-traveler" is not a compliment, though it is, of course, much better than "bourgeois." The latter, the "bourgeois" writers of Soviet Russia, have also been called the "internal emigration." Spiritually, they are closely related to the actual emigres of Paris and else, where, the intelligentsia of the old order. Achmatova, Belij, and Brusov are poets of the Soviet bourgeois school, Zamjatin, Pilniak, Sergeev-Zensky and Ehrenburg its prose-writers. They know how to write and, of course, the post-revolutionary poets and prose-writers have learned much from them. But they belong to the past, whether alive or dead, whether abroad or in Russia. A new and different intelligentsia is that of the fellow-trav elers, who are all much younger and belong -to the bespectaded, respectable and sensible 6lite, but one which was formed anew during and after the Revolution. With all good will and sin cerity, they try to keep up with change. All of them would be glad to forget their personal problems, which persecute them constantly like Furies, but this is beyond their power. To a certain extent they are outcasts, because usually they are not children of peasants or workers and especially because they are stil individualists; they have spiritual problems and try to solve them. Their chief problem is not new: the relationship of individual to society. Of course the most interesting writers in Soviet Russia are the fellow-travelers; the greatest among them are Leonid Leonov, a prose-writer, and Ilja Selvinsky, the poet. Selvinsky's effort at construction are very similar to neo 329</page><page sequence="7">POETRY: A Magazine of Verse realist prose. In him, poetry and prose join in a common search for new outlets and means of expression. His poetry achieves something vaster than mere chamber-music. He began to write in the early twenties, in the Bohemian style of the cabarets and of Essenin. But he was a dreamer and his first important book, very much discussed, was Uljalaevtschina (1927), which he calls an epic. Komandarm 2 (1930), Pushtorg (1931), Pacific Ocean Verses (1934), Pao-Pao (1932), Lyrics (1939), followed in rapid succession. His latest work is an interesting verse tragedy, Knight John (1939). He is the chief representative of constructivism, a school whose theoretician is K. Zelinsky, the only one of the many schools of literature which has survived without merging again with the undying proletarian school from which everything springs, in Russia, and to which every thing returns. Constructivism has survived while the imagists, the acmeists, and even the futurists faded away. Its theory, retical nonsense of other schools; but the constructivists happen to indude some talented poets, Selvinsky, Bagritzky and Lugovskoi, and their practical effort, based on a few fundamental theoreti cal declarations, has managed to be truly constructive while the theory itself has been as delirious as that of other schools which have not survived. As a poetical movement, constructivism springs from futur ism, but has since found a way back to reality. Together with the futurists, the constructivists fought the bloodless poetical sentiment which was the legacy of Russian symbolism; later, turning against futurism too, they fought the latter's empty slogans, abstract and anthropomorphic cosmic tendencies, doomed to remain empty. The theory of constructivism has not been victorious, but Selvinsky as a poet has succeeded. The 330</page><page sequence="8">New Trends in Soviet Russian Poetry central idea of constructivism is that all means of expression and description, in poetry, should be concentrated around the theme of the poem and notions determined by the theme. The poem's content must remain dominant: a dictatorship of content is prodaimed, and the poem's theme must be developed and constructed out of its basic meaning and sense. It is an anti futuristic and anti-formalistic reaffirmation of the contents of poetry. Anti-lyrical, on the one hand, and anti-utilitarian or anti-futuristic on the other (the futurists had stressed the utili tarian purpose of poetry, developing a sort of Gebrauchsdichtung very similar to the utilitarian poetry and music and painting of certain leftist groups, in the West, in recent years), the con structivists are still not anti-aesthetic. Their art tends towards a new kind of naturalism, where the sense is basic, not the sound. One of their chief themes is the part which the intelli gentsia has played in the Revolution and in the reconstruction; their poetry is that of socialist reconstruction, seen through the eyes of an intellectual. The theme of Selvinsky's Koman darm 2 is "the intellectual in the civil war"; that of his Push torg is "the intellectual in the socialist period of reconstruction." Setting aside all theory, one yet feels that Selvinsky, in his mature period, is neither lyrical nor poetic in the ordinary sense. His style is very close to the synthetic realism of the new Russian novel; he brings the techniques of prose to poetry, yet writes clear, precise and very original verse. He is primarily a naturalist, madly in love with life; like Zola, he does not hesitate to describe scenes of incredible cruelty, as in his Ulja laevtschina. But his love of life, of colors, tastes and pleasures, his passion for things, which he enjoys without ever idealizing them, make him a true poet. And his cultural attitude is defi 331</page><page sequence="9">P O E T R Y: A Magazine of Verse nitely Western, comparable only, in the Russia of today, to that of Pasternak (Uljalaevtschi-na contains some witty specu lations on modern European art), which prevents Selvinsky from ever appearing uncouth and gives him a sense of meas ure, one of his most outstanding qualities. This sense, which never abandons him even in his utopian visions of a rationalized and objective world of things-a new world to come-stamps him inevitably as one of the fellow-travelers who see the Revo lution and its aftermath with the eyes of an intellectual. Selvinsky always tends towards large forms; he is no lyrical poet, but he is probably the best of the post-revolutionary poets. His love of composition, of planned purpose, of protocols and development, drives him to attempt larger forms than are customary in contemporary poetry: the novel in verse (Ulia laevtschina and Pushtorg) or even the tragedy (Komandarm 2 and Knight John). But Selvinsky has not been alone in this task of breaking down the walls of routine and escaping from the withered lyric. Everything of any interest in modern Rus sian poetry tends towards vaster formal conceptions: Tvardov sky's folkloristic fairy tale, The Land Muravia, the poems of Michail Svetlov and Semjen Kirsanov. Svetlov is the most lyrical and tender of the younger prole tarian group, the best of the komsomol poets. He attracted attention with his powerful and extremely melodious serenade, or ballad, Grenade. In 1939 he wrote a Fairy-tale for the chil dren's theater of Moscow; though written in prose, it is clearly the work of a poet, a real fairy-tale, a dream of a far-off Siberia, so typical of the "frontier-literature" of modern Russia. It is a legend of the undiscovered gold in the East, of the heroic people who "go East"' to combat gigantic obstacles. All the char 332</page><page sequence="10">New Trends in Soviet Russian Poetry acters are heroic and lovable; the poet makes them live and escapes all ridicule by always observing them with tender and dever irony. The songs, between the acts of prose, are ex quisitely simple. Kirsanov is Svetlov's antithesis, not only because he is a fel low-traveler (though only by origin, and though he somehow tries to avoid the typical problems of this group) but also because he is the most talented pupil of Maiakovsky. Kirsanov's major work, until now, is a loud and enthusiastic symphony, Piatiletka (1931), on the theme of the Five-year Plan. It is to be hoped that Kirsanov will eventually outgrow Maiakovsky's formalism; if he does not, little of his poetry will survive. He does not possess the tremendous ego of his master, which is still the source of all that yet lives in Maiakovsky's poetry. To an enthusiastic follower of the great poet of the Revolution, the door to reality, which lacks extreme pathos, must remain closed. In Piatiletka, Kirsanov draws, with purposefully gigantic brush-strokes, the purely technical reconstruction of Russian eco nomic life, on the whole a very cold world where the trend towards vaster forms is a failure. But Kirsanov is a talented poet whose two collections of verse, Out of Books (1934) and Cape of Good Hope (1938), contain some good poems, such as The Bullfight and Your Poem. In the literature of post-revolutionary Russia, the novel is far more important and significant than poetry. Selvinsky remains on the frontier which separates these two literary forms. All Russian poetry which claims to be more than chamber-music tends away from lyrical form towards something vaster and different, towards folkloristic legend, fairy-tale and fable, to wards the epic, the historical drama. The influence and im 333</page><page sequence="11">PO ET R Y: A Magazine of Verse portance of the folkloristic poetry of Russia's many linguistic minorities, whose national literatures have all experienced a great renaissance in the past twenty years are felt in all literature which is written in Russian. The influence of the Caucasus, of Georgian and Armenian literatures, is particularly worthy of study. Yet Russian poetry, on the whole, today presents less formal and intellectual complexity than, say, contemporary American poetry. For the Russian poet, who believes firmly in the new order (the best poets, however, do not necessarily all believe in it), there are fewer problems than for us; and we derive much of our complexity, whether formal, intellectual or emotional, from our inability to solve our problems in any simpler way.
