Scribal variegation, on the other hand, sometimes suggests the decentralization of spon sorship or commission. As both a craft and a technology, writing had restricted cultural functions in the ancient Near East. These cultural particulars speak to the agency of political programs to foster refinement and systemic customization. Where and how did scribes in Canaan ply their trade in the political interregnum between the ebb of cunei form and the rise of the Iron II states? A survey of the early linear alphabetic corpus suggests that this medium largely appealed to prestige interests before the Iron II states harnessed its potential and instrumentalized its professionals. Elite posturing offered refuge to scribes on the periphery of the Iron I political economy. Scribal curricula may hold clues touching on the relationships between institutions and technological refine ment, between the cognitive potential of technology and its cultural application, and between the respective scribal intelligentsias of cuneiform and the linear alphabet. INTRODUCTION It is an axiom of bureaucracy that institutions are easier to destroy than institutional cultures. The cuneiform and linear alphabetic writing sys tems coexisted in Palestine during the Late Bronze Age. While cuneiform probably did not survive as a dominant medium in the region past the 12th cen tury B.c.E., linear alphabetic continued its develop ment apace from the early second millennium through its Phoenician refinement and customized variegation via derivative, so-called nationalized scripts. The Old Canaanite alphabet was just coming into its own in the Iron I Levant while cuneiform was eclipsing there. We have little way of knowing for certain whether or how the "institutional culture" of cuneiform writing, i.e., the scribal culture, relates to its counterpart cul ture of alphabetic writing. It is easy but dangerous to presume that all intelligentsias are kindred, a consid eration that hamstrings any claim that the Iron I prac titioners of linear alphabetic were the direct heirs of Canaan's cuneiform scribal culture; the alphabet had its own Late Bronze tradents. This paper intends to explore (1) how evidence for variant curricula may inform the impact of institutionalism on script stan dardization, (2) whether curricular patterns in the extant cuneiform and alphabetic corpora bear signif icance for the relationship between their respective scribal cultures, (3) the distinction between the pos sible and applied uses of writing as a technology (i.e., writing's "social location"), and (4) how the scribal trade survived at the margins of the decentral ized political economy of Iron I Palestine. Adding yet another peg to a base and baseless tautology, we might regard the southern Levant dur ing Iron Age I as a kind of historical black hole.1 The claim is base, because it pays obeisance to historical archaeologies that privilege texts over artifacts, which 1 Nliller (2005: xiii) toys with the term "Dark Ages" as a subtle jab at the scholarly hurry to transition the Israelites from nomad ism to monarchy (see Finkelstein and Na5aman 1994), while his larger thesis treats with the Iron I material as profitable data afforded the cultural historian. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 are tacitly deemed meaningless when no meaning arises that is appreciable to modern symbolic orders.2 The claim is baseless, because scholarship is awash in archaeological data and published databases that flow only to the limits set by those historians asking the questions.3 It is fair to note, however, that the epigraphic corpus from Iron I to Iron ILA Palestine is dramatically smaller and less informative than the regional corpora of Bronze Age cuneiform and the Iron IIB Old Hebrew inscriptions.4 A writing system is a technology that accrues cul tural merit as practical and creative applications ap pear to accommodate its potential. There is typically a cooperative relationship between the proliferation or development of a writing system and the political institutions that act as apparatus both for its systemic cultivation and chances to survive in the archaeo logical record as representative rather than anoma lous examples of practice. Seth Sanders (2004) has recently made such an argument for the refinement and maturation of the Ugaritic writing system as a state-sponsored technology, for example, and he ex tends this model to synthesize the intertwined rise of Levantine petty states and so-called national scripts. One incumbent charge of the nascent state is the in doctrination of its subjects into a political commu nity with sentiments of singular identity. The state's reified penumbra?on the ground and in the mind? is largely a product of the propaganda embedded in the political landscape (Smith 2003) and exploitation of language (Anderson 1991). The control of infor mation through scribal implements epitomizes the 2 See Moreland 2001 on the traditional dominance of logocen trism in the dialectic between archaeology and historiography. 3 See the synthetic studies of Bloch-Smith and Nakhai 1999; and Miller 2005. Raw survey data of immense import appear in Finkelstein and Lederman 1997; Zertal 2004; and now Miller's (2002) comprehensive inventory of highland Iron I sites. Survey data alone do not provide consistently reliable pictures of settle ment, however. Because they entail controlled excavation, salvage expeditions provide better data for large-scale distributive models (F?ust and Safrai 2005). 4 For a comprehensive review of the second-millennium cu neiform corpus, see the recent treatments of Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002; 2006.

In the case of Moab, Routledge (2004: 140-61) understands the Mesha In scription (KAI 181) as one of the state's primary me dia of self-substantiation. Segmented communities become "Moab" by tautology. To a largely nonliter ate community, writing may also serve as an instru ment of intimidation. William Schniedewind (2004) has recently characterized writing in ancient Israel as a projection of state power. We cannot ascertain the subaltern effects of the weird, unfathomable devices of manipulative elites, but the intent to condition a response is clear in the lapidary medium and other epigraphic affectations of status.5 THE IRON I SCRIBE'S RAISON D'?TRE The decentralized political economy of the Iron Age I-IIA stands in sharp contrast to that of its bookend archaeological periods. The Late Bronze Age witnesses a vibrant era of internationalism with respect both to material culture and the intangible elements of cultural exchange. Maritime and over land trade, imperial expansionism, vassalage, and epigraphic diplomacy manifest in abundant archaeo logical remains, which in turn illustrate the physical scope of the rich intellectual, political, and religious discourses of cross-cultural contact. The Iron Age IIB absorbs the unmistakable archaeological imprint of self-conscious, self-evident petty states with logisti cal sophistication domestically and commercial ex posure abroad. These two archaeological periods also share in common the deposition of epigraphic corpora quite unlike the finds from the Iron I-IIA interreg num. Epigraphy can speak of Late Bronze and Iron II scribal cultures, respectively cuneiform and alpha betic, with some self-assuredness. Between these in stitutional cultures, however, lies a chasm through 5 I emphasize elite intent in acknowledgment of the inscru table factors of circumlocution and negative feedback. Political propaganda need not find purchase exactly as intended. Unlike Schniedewind, epigraphers should distinguish between the elite characterization of writing as numinous and the auditor's defer ence to this characterization. Writing is not inherently mantic, nor can we assume a primitivist worldview in which some mantic de scriptors from the Near East confer upon all ancient audiences an uncritical submission to preternatural claims made on behalf of text. As L?vi-Strauss cautions (1973: 296-97), even the newly "literate" may understand the subtleties of textual farce.</page><page sequence="3">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 3 which echo two questions about the scribal profes sion. What functions does an Iron I scribe perform? Who is the Iron I scribe's clientele? The best evidence for a supraregional political economy is Megiddo's Stratum VI trade in Nile perch and possibly flints.6 These industries could indicate far-reaching exchange, but the evidence is equivocal. By virtue of its geographic location, however, Me giddo parades a disproportionately cosmopolitan ma terial culture in nearly every archaeological period.7 The lowland, arterial sites (i.e., those in coastal plains and inland-reaching valley depressions) traditionally benefit from easier topographic access, and so it does not surprise us to find relative affluence at an Iron I site like Tel Hadar (Kochavi 1993) on the eastern bend of the Beth-Shean corridor.8 P?trographie analysis indicates that some collared-rim jars traveled a dis tance, which Ilan (1999: 195-99) takes for trade in fungible contents.9 In any case, this period exhibits a steep decline in exchange relationships beyond bal kanized regions. Miller's yeoman narrative (2005: 45-63) of Iron I highland imports and endogamous exchange exposes what the evidence for agro-pasto ral subsistence (Hopkins 1985; Rosen 1994) has al ready implied: most imports do not come from far afield, nor do Egyptian trinkets necessarily denote in ternationalism in a setting with nearby Egyptian (or Egypto-Canaanite) lowland materials attested as late 6 The abundant flints from Area K might suggest production for exchange beyond the immediate vicinity; see Gersht 2006. The Nile perch finds from Stratum VI are ambiguous. Lernau (2000: 475-76) infers from the distribution that the fish may have thrived in the Levant's coastal rivers. Halpern (2000: 551-52), on the other hand, interprets the perch as long-distance trade markers. In a subsequent publication, however, Lernau (2006: 493) concedes that the perch must have been imported from the Nile Valley. 7 Instrumental neutron activation analysis of selected Stratum VI ceramics points to a Cypriot vector of origin, further under scoring Megiddo's fortune "to benefit from the social and cultural interaction that transpired between the nascent polities emerging in the political vacuum of the 11th century b.c.e." (Harrison and Han cock 2005: 719). The wherewithal of Megiddo's Stratum VI elites, moreover, pales next to the international assets of Stratum VII or the regional integration of Strata VA-IVB to IVA. 8 Hadar is not strictly a valley corridor site, but it abuts the natural topographic vector of inland-penetrating traffic, whether material or intellectual. The Iron ILA extension of this topographic pattern is visible in the relative affluence at Kinneret (Fritz and M?nger 2002) and Bethsaida (Arav and Bernett 2000). 9 Others (Esse 1992; Halpern 2000: 554; Faust in press) sug gest the jars were conveyed in patrilocal dowries. There may be substance to this interpretation in light of myriad Babylonian mar riage contracts that specify ceramics as dowered items. as the 1130s.10 The comparative poverty and isola tion of this "political economy" places the centrality of the Iron I scribe's relevance in doubt. If scribal culture indeed operated at the periphery of the dominant modes of consumption and exchange, then it is necessary to consider whether accounts, led gers, contracts, and letters represented the primary applications of the scribal craft. The economic land scape suggests that Iron I elite culture declined in stature on the basis of the conventional archaeologi cal indicators (status goods and symbols, imported wares, residential structures, and public works). To what extent did the services of scribes become a lux ury to the few who could afford to employ them? In other words, how does the trade of scribalism survive and reproduce itself in an environment that pushes its utility further to the margins of relevance? This re turns the discussion to the matter of clientele. Unlike the Late Bronze and Iron II epigraphic corpora, which reflect the dimensions of state interests, the Iron I evi dence suggests a culture of scribalism that survived largely through circumstantial appeal to elite patron age. In order to flesh out the vicissitudes in scribal cul ture from the Middle Bronze Age to the Iron Age IIB, the discussion now turns to the empirical evidence for the trajectory toward standardization. SCRIPT STANDARDIZATION, PEDAGOGY, AND CURRICULA Christopher Rollston (1999; forthcoming) has completed a comprehensive quantitative palaeo graphic study of the corpus of stratified Old Hebrew inscriptions from the eighth to sixth century b.c.e. The major results of this undertaking include an em pirical database that favors the development of a standardized, interregional Hebrew script over the final two centuries of the Iron Age II. Specifically, the data inflict enormous damage on critiques of palaeography that deride the specialty as insensitive to the natural variations in handwriting that charac terize even most modern handwritten scripts. More generally, they provide epigraphers with more infor mation with which to investigate the possible curric ula that Iron Age scribes used to learn reading and writing. 10 Viz., the site of Megiddo, where a Ramses VI cartouche (ca. 1140 B.c.E.) appeared beneath the sealed destruction layer of Stra tum VIIA; see Weinstein 1992; Ussishkin 1995; Harrison 2004: 9.</page><page sequence="4">4 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 Even the observation of a standardized script cutting across regions and centuries does not satisfy questions about the existence of institutional schools or guilds of scribes.11 Variability in ancient and modern hands has produced an impasse between the doubters and true believers of palaeography.12 Mod ern writers are sensitive to their own inconsistencies in penmanship and so naturally suspect the precision of typological analysis. It is always an uphill en deavor, however, to analogize with modern anec dotalism. Ancient scribes were professional writers with the skill to produce commissioned texts me thodically as well as the luxury to employ a coarser cursive when opportune. The rising dependence on word processors and the decline in required penman ship courses in grammar schools have together sav aged the aesthetics of student handwriting (to say nothing of vernacular orthography's debt to the spell check function) in what was never a community of uniform professional hands even before the personal computer's sudden affordability in the late 1980s. The closest approximate modern parallels to early alphabetic scribal instruction are draftsmanship cur ricula prior to the commercial introduction of CAD software.13 This is also an imperfect comparison, but the curricula exhibit kindred graphic austerity, reproduction exercises within registers, and a meth odological distinction between professional and in formal hands. Apprentice draftsmen first learned to reproduce the alphabet within a register template. The mastery of this skill permitted the draftsman to affix a script with uniform size and spacing to hand drawn architectural blueprints. The critical point is that a draftsman's professional hand may differ sub stantially from his cursive or informal hand, but never should the latter characterize a professional docu ment. Handwritten blueprint text ultimately reflects 11 There is still little consensus on the normalization of Iron Age schooling; see surveys of evidence and varying scholarly views in the works of Rollston (2006), Crenshaw (1998), Lemaire (1981; 1984), Davies (1995), Puech (1988), Haran (1988), Why bray (1990) and Jamieson-Drake (1991). 12 Respectively representative views find expression in Kauf man 1986 and Cross 2003: 344-50. 13 Recall specifically the gradual proliferation of CalComp workstations in the 1970s and AutoCAD software in the early 1980s. These and kindred advances essentially destroyed hand drawn architectural drafting and concomitant training with alpha betic registers. the pedagogical austerity of alphabetic transcription exercises. We might also consider the use of the grid system among Egyptian artisans in the initial illustration of tomb and monumental paintings. Most relevant here perhaps is the employment of grid templates to facil itate proper proportion of both human figures and hieroglyphic accompaniment. The glyphs typically adhere to axial registers or baselines. Gay Robins (1994) offers a comprehensive review of the grid sys tem as an instrument of artisan organizations from the Middle Kingdom onward. In numerous examples, one sees instances where the standardization of a graphic product through the use of registers is the result of coordinated methods of instruction and duplication. This does not necessarily validate Iversen's notion (1975) of a "canon of proportions," however. Robins (1994: 56) counters with an obser vation of individualism: "Plainly Egyptian artists were not working within a rigid, unchangeable sys tem from which only bad practitioners deviated."14 One rather witnesses the practiced hand of a master artisan who still respects the professionalism of the baseline. Rollston (2003: 160-62, 178) observes that in in stances with a samek-pe sequence in a provenanced Iron IIB-C Hebrew inscription, there is a consistent pattern with respect to vertical placement.15 The samek always ascends to a height above the regis ter's ceiling line, while thepe nestles snuggly below the left edge of the samek's lowest crossbar. This is an important detail. While palaeographic analysis often considers ductus relative to the baseline, less frequently does it ruminate on placement patterns of characters relative to each other. There are meaning ful patterns in this domain that perhaps speak to cur ricular instruction. There are no deviations from the samek-pe sequence in any individual scribe's hand in Hebrew during the eighth to sixth centuries regard 14 Compare the comments of Sch?fer (1974: 326-34), who allows for the artisan's deviation from a "canon of proportions" only for objects other than humans and animals. 15 This pattern overlaps media?the samek-pe sequence oc curs on both ostraca and the Royal Steward Inscription (Rollston 2003: 178)?a fact that testifies to the progressive cursive's influ ence on the lapidary medium. While the restrictive space of stamp seal registers understandably curtails this pattern within the me dium, there is nevertheless a specimen from Megiddo (Avigad and Sass 1997: no. 85); see Rollston 2003: 161, n. 63.</page><page sequence="5">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 5 less of region.16 This graphic relationship, moreover, does not appear (to my knowledge) in the Phoeni cian, Aramaic, or Transjordanian scripts.17 I argue that this juxtaposed letter placement is a memory reflex of alphabetic transcription. In other words, one imagines a Hebrew abecedary in common use with a samek-pe template that consistently locates thtpe beneath the samek's crossbars. The abecedary ostensibly functions as a curricular guide for the du plication of the alphabet (Puech 1988).18 Epigraphers envision scribal students writing and rewriting the alphabet as an exercise to gain familiarity and pro ficiency with the characters, their relative size, and their relative placement. This parallels the use of lexical lists from the Sumero-Akkadian curriculum in which duplication is the primary mechanism of familiarizing the students with the relevant inven tory of signs (Tinney 1998; Veldhuis 1998; 2004). The popularity of such an abecedary or curricular primer would account for the uniformity of the samek-pe relationship over the course of the eighth to sixth centuries. It would further substantiate the existence of a pe-(ayin Hebrew abecedary in preva lent (if not dominant) use until (or later than) the close of the Iron Age. This does not necessarily con firm the existence of scribal schools as institutions, but it does serve as potent evidence in favor of tra ditional pedagogical aids. 16 Two incriminating exceptions to the ascendant samek are the Moussa?eff ostraca (Bourdreuil, Israel, and Pardee 1996) and the Jehoash Inscription, both of which are unprovenanced (hence suspect a priori) and unmistakable forgeries on countless other grounds; see Rollston's damning palaeographic analysis (2003). 17 Overarching sameks are rare in general outside of Hebrew, regardless of the adjacent letter. "Note that, with some excep tions," writes Rollston (2003: 178), "samek in Phoenician and Aramaic does not tower over other letters in the same way as in Old Hebrew." 18 Abecedary inscriptions themselves may also represent scribal exercises and occasionally doodling, as one perhaps sees in Kuntillet cAjrud's Pithos B (Hadley 1987). The abecedary is a cross-cultural idiom, appearing in Latin, Greek, and Etruscan in addition to West Semitic. Coogan (1974) has argued that the Latin term elementa derives indirectly from the l-m-n sequence in the al phabet's second exercise register; this is a romantic notion, but one should like better documentation for Greek intermediation. Coogan (1990) furthermore interprets the West Semitic root V'lp to reflect the abecedarian's exercise in verbal form, i.e., "to tran scribe the alphabet," perhaps in parallel to the Greek verb poini k?zen, "make Phoenician [letters]." But see the caveats of Haran (1988), who disputes the assumption that the abecedary necessar ily indexes school duplication exercises. While the pe-(ayin sequence appears at Izbet Sartah (Demsky 1977), Kuntillet fAjrud,19 and in the biblical acrostics,20 the Lachish abecedary (Lemaire 1976) bears an (ayin-pe sequence in a remedial hand with little control over the baseline. The quality of this scribal hand should not be taken outright to sug gest a poorly learned pe-cayin convention, however. This find may index a genuine pedagogical varia tion. Haran (1988) has agued that the abecedary it self need not signify a scribal school, especially in the light of the find-spots of many such specimens. Haran's skepticism is confessedly a reaction to the sanguine treatment of Lemaire (1981), who does not hesitate to surmise the existence of a formal school at a given archaeological site with the sparsest of epigraphic evidence.21 Their impasse seems to con cern the recovery of schools by syllogism. This syl logism takes scribal training for scribal schools, thus further taking the abecedary as evidence for the lat ter. This leap is unnecessary. The survival of epi graphic material indicates an act of qualified literacy, however culturally restricted, which assumes scribal training res ipsa loquitur. This need not import the anachronism of the school. The presumption among some West Semitic epig raphers of formal schooling in a dedicated building evidently derives from Kramer's (1949) once-influ ential Mesopotamian model and Sj?berg's (1976) 19 We may further infer from Kuntillet cAjrud's Pithos B that a pe-(ayin abecedary enjoyed use in the north. The pithos bears both the samek-pe reflex and the name 5Amaryaw with the char acteristic northern elision of the theophor (Davies 1991: 81, nos. 8.019-8.021). This ascription is circumstantial, however, as it depends on the scribe's dialect rather than that of 'Amaryaw him self. See further Hadley 1987. 20 See Lam 2-4; Ps 9-10; and (in LXX) Prov 31. 21 Lemaire (1981; 1984) makes the most impassioned case by far for organized schools in the Iron Age Levant, while Puech (1988) and Davies (1995) offer more restrained inferences from the epigraphic data. Whybray (1990) and Crenshaw (1998) rep resent more moderate positions on the modesty of private scribal education, while Haran (1988) trends even more skeptically with respect to the interpretation of "school materials." Jamieson Drake's oft-cited manifesto (1991) rejects nearly any notion of scribal culture at all until the very late Iron Age II on the equa tion of monumental architecture with literate haute couture. While I indeed envision state patronage as a cultivator of scribal refinement and apparatus for professional organization, Jamie son-Drake's work strikes me as fatally reductionist in its ap propriation of pass? political taxonomies from structuralist anthropology.</page><page sequence="6">6 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 dissection of edubba pedagogy.22 This model has since evolved with closer scrutiny of the tablets' find-spots. Recent work on cuneiform scribal education now mil itates against the concepts of a dedicated edifice and a uniform employment of instructional aids.23 Even the Old Babylonian curricular literature and its order varied according to the individual predilections of pri vate instructors, notwithstanding the legendary ortho dox canon of scribal pedagogy. Robson's (2001) investigation of the Nippur schools "shows that there was by no means a standard curriculum across the city, but rather a common fund of shared compositions upon which individual teachers drew according to per sonal taste or pedagogical preference."24 The circula tion of variant West Semitic abecedaries may reflect specific pedagogical choices of, or access to, primers made within individual learning environments which do not detract from the trajectory toward the standard ized templates suggested by Rollston's work. Indeed, not until the Iron II emergence of state interests in 22 The elephantine cache of secondary literature on cuneiform scribal culture and education permits only an abridged set of ci tations. Studies of scribal history and culture include Pearce 1995; Visicato 2000; Wilcke 2000; and Sasson 2002. For sympathetic views of the edubba literature, see Kramer 1949; Sj?berg 1976; and now Volk 2000. Seminal lexicographic studies beyond MSL are Civil 1976; 1995.

Sj?berg's famous depiction (1976) of a monolithic school has left an indelible but anachronistic mark on scholarly approaches to edubba particulars. There are qualified elements of the older "school building" approach in a recent article by George (2005: 133-34), who carefully restricts this possibility to subsidies of Ur III micromanagement. One indeed infers from Ur III epigraphic effects a causal state-interest in regulation (Michalowski 1991; Vi sicato 2000: 7, n. 24), but the edubba vignettes (Kramer 1949; Volk 2000) are still likely stylized profiles (Robson 2001: 39). We cannot make much architectural sense out of Shulgi's abstruse ref erences to the ?-g?stug-dnissaba-mul or the ki-umun?which some take as formal academies?when even city gates boast m?tonymie or ideological designations. Nor do "autobiographical" hymns that praise Shulgi as the best student among his peers rise above the opacity of propaganda. Shulgi no doubt received the private instruction befitting an absolute monarch, albeit with a master scribe who had every occasion to compliment his royal pupil on his progress vis-?-vis that of lesser tutees. 24 See further Tinney 1999. scribal discourse did the necessary cultural apparatus appear to coax the refinement of this professional technology. Even so, the pe-'ayin alphabetic order did not give way to the (ayin-pe standard of post-exilic Hebrew until quite late. The later concretization of cayin-pe in the light of preponderant Iron Age abece daries of another order suggests the arbitrariness of the selection. Arbitrary selections tend to index insti tutional codification, which may likewise bear on late Iron II palaeographic development under chancery aegis. In other words, thepe-(ayin alphabet was a stan dard of the Iron II state, while the (ayin-pe alphabet became the standard of priestly Yehud and subse quent Judaism. The Iron IIB "homogenization" of the Hebrew script speaks of scribal deference to an emerging ideal hand which served a political program. The early Iron Age tells a different story, in which variant primers circulated in an environment with more circumstantial patronage of writing. CAVEATS ON CURRICULAR VARIATION FROM CUNEIFORM The standardization of the Hebrew curriculum is attributable to elite encouragement during the Iron Age IIB.25 Before this juncture, it seems that di versified, decentralized scribal instruction employed variant pedagogical aids. Conventional wisdom has moved away from the schoolhouse model that Kramer (1949) popularized in his edition of the Su merian "Schooldays" text. Scribal instruction mainly occurred in private homes with a handful of students at most (Charpin 1990; Robson 2001). The notable departure is the Ur III state's attempt to coordinate instruction in order to facilitate the needs of a grow ing bureaucracy (if not stimulate sycophancy with curricular hagiography)?an exception supporting the rule.26 It falls to the state to unfurl standards. 25 We must distinguish between palaeographic evidence for Iron IIB-C script standardization (with, what I infer therefrom, a concomitantly dominant pe-(ayin abecedary) and the post-Iron II conversion to an (ayin-pe abecedary. These conventions are both products of elite patronage, but they represent distinct phenomena of different eras. If the Lamentations acrostic assumes a date after 587 B.c.E., then we see the persistence of the pe-'ayin order well into the sixth century (if not later). 26 As Michalowski explains (1991: 51-53), the micromanage ment of the dub-sar's formative "textualization" under Shulgi's self-aggrandized regime may have produced only a marginally more literate scribal class; any attempts to unify the curricula served baser political instincts than "the pursuit of pure knowledge" (to squeeze blood from another academy's malapropian stone).</page><page sequence="7">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 7 This is the axiomatic essence of Adam Smith's (2003) charge that the "state" substantiates itself with a mental map of a political landscape.27 The adminis trative refinement of writing may yield both internal (organizational) and external (representational) div idends when a government elects to transform a script into an emblem or a literature into an ideol ogy.28 Beyond the short-lived Ur III experiment, the variable of individualism left its mark in the selective use of primer materials from the so-called Mesopo tamian canon.29 The derivative curricula that facilitated the use and abuses of second-millennium Peripheral Akka dian in parts west and north exhibit more extreme variability in the evidence for (or choice of) peda gogical texts. Artzi (1990) has inventoried the extant lexical materials from Akhetaten, where cuneiform scribes had access to the Silbenalphabet, Sa Sylla bary, An-Anum, and Diri. Notable texts of the so called standard curriculum are absent often due to the accident of discovery, but perhaps there are also cases of selective or restricted access to the wider inventory of instructional aids. Alalakh has so far produced only specimens from the Ur5-ra = hubullu series,30 while Ugarit boasts nearly the entire reper toire save Erimhus and Kagal (van Soldt 1995). Only Ugarit and Boghazk?y apparently featured Proto-Lu and grammatical texts in their curricula; only these 27 Smith is admittedly uncomfortable with the anthropological reification of the "state," but that illusory taxon is nevertheless the referent political archetype of the built environment as he envi sions the operations of self-authentication. To paraphrase Smith's own paraphrase of Solzhenitsyn, the state is the conceptually con tiguous archipelago from which archaeology cannot escape, be cause the state's cultural valence is equal parts emic and etic. I insist on a phenomenological recognition of the actual "essential izing act" endemic both to statecraft and the scholarship of state craft (Byrne forthcoming). 28 See Messick 1993 for a parade example from Yemen, where polity and calligraphy claim coextensive existence in pub lic discourse. 29 Note that Wilcke (2000) sees in variability a need to diver sify and enlarge the traditional understanding of elite cuneiform literati. Wilcke's conclusions are not altogether convincing, but his important work on scribal diversity (1992; 2000) demonstrates the need for better theoretical discourse on literacy. 30 The archaeological distribution of evidence warrants tenta tive analytical inference; see Artzi 1990: 153, n. 43. For half a century, essentially three lexicographic texts have framed the ped agogical picture at Alalakh (Wiseman 1953: 113, nos. 445-47, al though I surmise that texts 452-53 also assume curricular substrates). In 2003, however, Chicago excavators discovered an Ur5-ra XVIII fragment in Tell Atchana's topsoil (Lauinger 2005). The tablet's superficial stratification speaks truth to caution. two cities and Emar boast the Sa Vocabulary among the Peripheral Akkadian corpora. Are what Artzi (1990: 140) calls Akhetaten's "surprising gaps" ac cidental or intentional? Faivre (1995) cautions that cuneiform texts were regularly recycled, and Civil (1995: 2307) notes that this practice was especially true of school texts. Many exercise tablets were never fired, and thus these survive mainly in confla gration detritus or secondary usage (viz., fill material for walls). Beckman (1983) and Artzi (1990) convinc ingly attribute the parallelism between the chancery curricula at Akhetaten and Boghazk?y to a Hittite edubba tradition established in Egypt in an anterior period. There are clear parallels in ductus and canon, viz. the literary legends of the kings of Akkade, which appear both in Hatti and EA 359.31 It is note worthy that the city-state of Ugarit exhibits the most diverse collection of pedagogical aids among all the Peripheral Akkadian corpora, including that of Hatti. Part of the incongruity admits of complex scribal in termediation; Ugarit's lexicographic series derived from a Hurrian tradition, while Boghazk?y's did not (Beckman 1983: 103).32 In view of the selective use of pedagogical aids in the Old Babylonian Nippur curricula (Robins 2001), then, it is probably wisest to concede (at least tentatively) a variegated pattern of text distribution in the peripheral cuneiform cul tures stemming from the independence of individual teachers or chanceries.33 This pattern may indicate pedagogical discrimination, circumstances of inter mediation, and/or accident of discovery. Wilcke 31 Viz., the "King of Battle" epic (Sar tamh?ri); see the dis cussions of Beckman (1983: 112-13) and Westenholz (1997: 4 5, 102-31). EA 359's Egypto-Hittite ductus suggests an Egyptian copy of a Hittite import to Izre5el (1997: 71), while the Hittite orthography (which Izre'el also notes) suggests an Anatolian original to others (Westenholz 1997: 105). The tablet unfortu nately has not undergone p?trographie sourcing (Goren, Finkel stein, and Na'aman 2004: 87). 32 Beckman (1983: 101-2) credits Assyrian and Babylonian sources for Boghazk?y's lexical inventory; this Empire-era trans mission parallels (and complements) Hurrian intermediation, the fruits of which included Boghazk?y's introduction to the Gil gamesh and Kumarbi literature. 33 Curricular vectors of origin may also play a formative role in the ultimate profile of a derivative curriculum. This is certainly the case with Hittite influence on the Egyptian curriculum, al though the latter includes one literary text, the Adapa myth (EA 356), which originated in Babylonia on p?trographie grounds (Goren, Finkelstein, and Na5aman 2004: 82-83; but see Izre'el 2001: 55-59). Izre'el (1997: 46; 2001: 51-52) broached this pos sibility for the Adapa text (or its Urtext) on the basis of its affin ities with Middle Babylonian ductus. The ductus is similar in the</page><page sequence="8">8 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 (1992) sees in Emar's orthography, palaeography, phraseology, and grammar at least two distinct scribal schools in operation. Such a distinction may imply something about eclectic learning syllabary at the site, but it also curbs expectations of standardiza tion in Peripheral Akkadian more generally. Pre scriptivist characterizations of Peripheral Akkadian as "barbarized" unfortunately tend to deemphasize the fact that, in cases where Akkadian was not the dominant spoken language (Mitanni, Hatti, Ugarit, Canaan), the "language" instead functioned as a technological instrument.34 The appropriation of Akkadian was an adaptive technical act, while Akka dian's functions (diplomatic, epistolary, etc.) were culturally ad hoc. Like scribes in Nippur and Emar, the cuneiform ists in Palestine perhaps enjoyed the opportunity to choose primers for apprentices from an assortment of materials.35 Izre5el (2001: 52) identifies the Adapa recension from Akhetaten as a school text with the observation (among others) that it privileges Akka dian syllabic spelling over the frequent use of logo grams. If this orthographic criterion indeed suggests a pedagogical character, then it is worth noting that the Gilgamesh fragment from Megiddo follows suit. In 19 lines of fragmentary cuneiform, there are only three logograms; those logograms all present the same name, ^im-mas, who is none other than Gil gamesh (Goetze and Levy 1959: 121-23). In other words, the logographic spelling is incidental, almost formulaic, in its exception to the otherwise exclusive Nergal and Ereshkigal text (EA 357), but in this case the inclu sions denote an Egyptian provenance (Goren, Finkelstein and Na'aman 2004: 83). One sees a hodgepodge in the confluence of a Hittite-influenced edubba (in turn partially derived from Hur rian cuneiform and its idiosyncrasies; see Beckman 1983: 102 3), imported Babylonian canonical texts, and native Egyptian copies characterized by emulated Babylonian ductus with Pe ripheral Akkadian spelling (Izre5el 2001: 53). Still more peculiar is the adaptation of the Egyptian red-point system, ordinarily used to demarcate Egyptian syntagms, in order to indicate pro sodie units in the Akkadian literary texts EA 356, 357, and 372 (Izre&gt;el2001: 81-90). 34 Moran (1992: xxi) freely designates some Amarna Akka dian as "extremely barbarized"; M?rquez Rowe (1998: 63) uses "barbarised" for Hurro-Akkadian in an equivocal way; Rainey (1996b: 1) refreshingly rejects the term "barbaric" as a charge that "can no longer be sustained." In von Dassow's view (2004), the al loglottographic character of Amarna Akkadian complicates its very designation as a language. 35 For a general conjecture of scribal education in Canaanite Akkadian, see Demsky's digest (1990). syllabic orthography.36 The Gilgamesh tablet, then, was probably a literary text assigned in the advanced stages of scribal education at Megiddo.37 This dis covery complements the larger inventory of curricu lar texts discovered in Bronze Age Palestine.38 The larger Canaanite inventory may have included still other literary compositions and l?xica. Miguel Civil (1995: 2307) argues that the quality of instruc tion in Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform differed notice ably in peripheral sites such as Emar, Ugarit, and Boghazk?y from that of Mesopotamia proper. Thus, he attributes the inferiority of the Peripheral Akka dian product to its status as a second language, but he also sees the consequence of an inferior education with alien primers. Lexical lists of early second-mil lennium Sumerian canals or marsh fish, he argues (1995: 2307), would prove entirely meaningless to late second-millennium West Semitic scribes. The esoteric nature of these l?xica might indeed have 36 After all, ^im-mas is persona sine qua non. 37 Demsky (1990: 164-65) has intimated as much. The ad vanced stages of literary transcription are amply documented (Veldhuis 2004), notably including the "Gilgamesh and Huwawa" text within the Sumerian Decad at Old Babylonian Nippur (Tin ney 1999). The fact that the Gilgamesh epic was a core component of the scribal intelligentsia of Late Bronze Canaan partly obviates the need to reconstruct a relationship of transmission between the cross-cultural flood narratives of Mesopotamia and Judah. While there may exist other Babylonian signatures in the Primeval His tory that hint at exilic-era influences, there is no compelling rea son to exclude the possibility that, by the early Iron Age, highland Judaean lore understood the ancestral iterations of the deluge as an autochthonous mythos. I demur from Lambert's view (1967: 127), on grounds too numerous to digest here, that early post Kassite Babylon itself had no knowledge of the flood story except by late conversation with Sippar conservators. In view of the pop ularity of Sargonic legends among peripheral cuneiform curricula (Beckman 1983), perhaps the "Sargon Birth Legend" (Westenholz 1997: 36-49) found its way into peripheral hands just as the "King of Battle" epic came to Egypt. The latter appears in recensional form at Akhetaten as EA 359 (see Westenholz 1997: 102-31). Sar gonic staples of the Canaanite curriculum could help historical critics to digest the elliptically "aboriginal" Moses infancy topos (Exod 2:1-10) in Iron Age Judaean folklore. 38 These include lexical texts from Hazor (Tadmor 1977), Tel Aphek (Rainey 1975; 1976), and Ashkelon (Huehnergard and van Soldt 1999); liver model fragments from Hazor (Landsberger and Tadmor 1964); and a mathematical fragment from Hazor (Horowitz 1997). For the use of omina in scribal education, see Koch-Westenholz 2000: 15; van Soldt (1995: 176-77) suggests the curricular employment of omina at Ugarit. For cuneiform mathematical primers, see Robson 1999; and Nemet-Nejat 1988; 1995. Extensive bibliographies on these and noncurricular texts appear in Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002; 2006.</page><page sequence="9">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 9 undermined their pedagogical efficacy to some de gree in peripheral cuneiform cultures, but the work of Niek Veldhuis introduces caveats about the peda gogical function of content in the so-called Listen wissenschaft. He (Veldhuis 1997; 2004) argues that Sumerian lists of leather products, wooden objects, birds, and the like served the primary function of modeling cuneiform signs and words for the purpose of graphic duplication exercises. The reproduction of Sumerian words placed emphasis on the "training in Sumerian reading, writing, and culture" (Veldhuis 2004: 65). Civil's characterization would prove more resonant had West Semitic scribes needed to mention Sumerian canals in their professional compositions; as it was, they did not.39 In peripheral curricula, the Sumerian words themselves did not always need to be understood in order to facilitate the graphic ob jectives. The Hittite tradition was barely conversant in Sumerian (Beckman 1983), although Sumerian l?xica are attested at Boghazk?y. In Mesopotamia, even Old and Middle Babylonian scribes would have approached the l?xica in Sumerian, by their eras a dead language, with some cultural distance. In any case, the West Semitic column in the Ur5-ra fragment from Ashkelon (Huehnergard and van Soldt 1999) implies the attempt, however successful, of Amarna period scribes to interact with the lexical content of these "alien" materials. And while the trilingual prism from Aphek (Rainey 1976) does not conform to any known Mesopotamian curriculum, it too sug gests Canaanite interest in polyglot lexicography.40 There are several dimensions of the Amarna cor respondence that might prove pertinent to the ques tion of sundry curricula. The dialectal diversity of Peripheral Akkadian, which is conventionally di vided into northern (variously called Syro-Anatolian, Reichsakkadisch, Hurro-Akkadian, and the regretta bly ambiguous "Assyrian") and southern (Canaanite Akkadian) branches, is a testament to regional vari ation in practice. Notable is the fact that the Late 39 Canaanite scribes nevertheless made plentiful use of logo grams (livestock, professions, etc.) in culturally appropriate con texts. Many of these are elementary signs (they occur in the Sa literature, which is attested at Ugarit but not in Canaan), and they often appear reproduced correctly; but see Rainey 1996a: 26-36 for evidence of variants. 40 Another lexical fragment from Aphek (Rainey 1975: 125? 28) may also have contained polyglot entries; see Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002: 755 (Aphek 1); 2006: 29-31. Bronze scribes from Egypt and Jerusalem employed a form of Akkadian more consistent with the north ern branch, notwithstanding the regional geographic buffer of what one might call an "isogloss" bifur cating Peripheral Akkadian's northern and southern branches. These noncontiguous pockets of dialectal affinity may speak to kindred curricular traditions within a larger pluralism of scribal attitudes. With re spect to the Jerusalem scribe, Moran (2003: 249-74) is keen to note not only lexical breaks from Canaan ite-Akkadian, but also departures in palaeography, orthography, and syllabary.41 These latter features of cuneiform writing are profoundly indebted in execu tion to the specific pedagogical primers employed in scribal training; the inventory, appearance, and com bination of signs are the hallmarks of the duplica tion exercise. We run amiss to neglect the enormous impact of local languages on Akkadian writing in its peripheral incarnations?the Mitannian examples are legion, especially the reverberant effects of pho nology on orthography (M?rquez Rowe 1998)?but we do well also to note that consistency of depar ture from the Mesopotamian norm might imply some thing about tools as well as method in peripheral education. Consider the use of logograms, for ex ample, which constituted not an insignificant portion of the edubba lexical exercises. Rainey (1996a: 34 35) attributes variant usage by Canaanite scribes to "a poorly learned logogram." This is a reasonable enough conclusion,42 but there are perhaps pedagog ical circumstances that might illuminate the origin of some variants. As Huehnergard and van Soldt (1999: 191) reconstruct the Ashkelon Ur5-ra frag ment, it corresponds exactly to that of the Emar cognate.43 As Civil (1989: 9) notes, however, "Most lexical tablets from the Northwest teem with scribal mistakes." These mistakes are plentiful in Emar's 41 Moran (2003: 272-74) prefers to classify the Jerusalem cor pus as a philological admixture with "northern" influence (from an ethnolinguistic junction on the Syrian Canaanite-Akkadian/ Reichsakkadisch isogloss), while Rainey (1996b: 24-26) prefers the term "Assyrianism." Whether Assyrianisms per se pervade the corpus is open to interpretation, however (Moran 2003: 266, n. 58; Rainey 1996b: 26). 42 West Semitic morphosyntax better explains sharp depar tures in verbal forms than it does nominal logograms (excepting deviant phonetic complements with western signatures). 43 The Ur5-ra I tablet from Emar (Arnaud 1987: 38-46) pre serves almost the complete Sumerian text.</page><page sequence="10">10 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 lexical aids, especially the Sa Vocabulary.44 Varia tion in content and order not only depart from Assur and Boghazk?y standards, cautions Civil, but also internally within the broader Emar lexical corpus. It is difficult to hazard whether incongruities existed between the complete Ashkelon and Emar l?xica or whether such variants might have influenced vocabu lary in scribal practice. One does imagine, on the other hand, that lexical errors in primers would have contributed to some of the poorly learned logo grams that Rainey infers from Amarna variants. If one furthermore holds with von Dassow that Ca naanite-Akkadian, replete with Glossenkeile, repre sented an intelligible Akkadographic writing system intended as much for readers as writers, then it is logical to posit the incorporation of the substrate peculiarities into formal training. She writes (2003: 215-16): ... let us consider the Canaanite glosses, that is, Canaanite words spelled out syllabically following either a logogram or a syllabically spelled Akka dian word, and signaled by a gloss mark. Such glosses are usually taken to indicate the language of the writer of the text. But in actual practice they were surely meant for the reader: the purpose of writing a gloss would have been to aid the reader in understanding the glossed word. In the case of the Canaanite Amarna letters, then, the practice of occasionally glossing logograms and Akkadian words with Canaanite words would have been pre mised on the assumption that the reader might re quire some assistance, by means of a Canaanite translation, in order to comprehend those logograms and Akkadian words. In other words, the reader was expected to understand the text in Canaanite! 44 As van Soldt (1995: 172-74) reconstructs the elementary Ugaritic curriculum in syllabic cuneiform, students copied the Sa Vocabulary fairly early. This lexicon of simple signs represents one of the student's first polyglot texts. Errors in his Sa Vocabu lary could reverberate throughout a scribe's career. If the Emar l?xica bore any broader similarities with the Ashkelon l?xica, then it becomes easier (though not any safer) to account for any num ber of variant logograms in the Canaanite corpora. On the other hand, Artzi (1990: 148-51) considers the Sa Syllabary (the Sa Vocabulary's immediate precursor in van Soldt's curricular se quence) a "more advanced stage" of the transcription education. Veldhuis's work (1998) on transcription sequences, however, counters Artzi's characterization. What Artzi considers "ad vanced" work in fact precedes the student's initial exposure to polyvalence and compound signs (as in Ur5-ra), abstract polyva lence (as in Ea and Diri), and Sumerian/Akkadian "incongruities" (as in the acrographics), to say nothing of work with model con tracts, letters, proverbs, or literary texts. Von Dassow characterizes the Canaanite gloss system as an Akkadographic code between corre spondents, rather than the representation of a living, spoken dialect.45 Were this code to function effec tively, i.e., achieve the results for which it was osten sibly innovated, then one expects to find the code's incorporation into the scribal curriculum. Without more Canaanite syllabaries and l?xica, however, we cannot vet this theory. If this code arose to assist the reader as much as (if not more than) the author, as von Dassow maintains, then one further supposes curricular familiarity with the code among scribal re cipients. In other words, the Akkadographic code had better render Canaanite letters more intelligible to Egyptian readers in order to justify its invention.46 On the other hand, the road to perdition is paved with circumlocutions: shorthand and glosses can obfus cate as much as clarify a document's meaning. Mo ran (1992: xxii) and Rainey (1996b: 32) also freely characterize the Amarna language as a code; so too does Pardee (1999: 313), but he sees randomness in its execution: The Akkadian of these texts was a learned language, a lingua franca?none of the scribes of these texts was a native speaker of Akkadian as spoken in Mes opotamia. It had already been in use in Canaan long enough to develop into a sort of code understood only by the scribal class who used it: for speakers of Canaanite it was incomprehensible because it was basically Akkadian, while the extent to which it reflected Canaanite, particularly the morphology and morphosyntax of the verbal system, would have made it nearly as incomprehensible for a speaker of Akkadian. The code, however, was never system atized: it is clear from the examination of variants 45 See von Dassow's (2004 [2006]) further characterization of Amarna Akkadian as an alloglottographic system, which deserves fuller consideration than my paper offers. Publication delays at the American Oriental Society did not permit me access to this article until the final editorial stage of the present manuscript. Von Das sow's study is linguistically more circumspect than that of Gianto, who vaguely settles on the "interlanguage" designation to de scribe "the development of a linguistic system in its own right" (1999: 131). 46 See Izre'el 1995; Gianto 1999; and von Dassow 2004, who draw important attention to the reading of glosses by recipients. The Taanach letters indicate that Canaanite principalities also wrote to each other in Akkadian. This suggests that Canaanite scribes may have originally developed a gloss code for Levantine correspondence rather than for an Egyptian readership. The code's embeddedness nevertheless accounts for its attestation in letters to non-West Semitic recipients.</page><page sequence="11">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 11 of given forms that the scribes vacillated between their native language and their imperfectly learned Akkadian. Such variants are beyond dispute, as Moran and Rainey have exhaustively detailed. Pardee does not specify whether he has in mind variants between geographic corpora (Gezer, Byblos, Amurru, etc.) or variants within a given geographic corpus. The limits of my expertise do not permit me to infer the pat tern of distribution to which he alludes, but it stands to reason that variants between city-states may yet speak to emic curricular aids of idiosyncratic char acter (whether rife with errors as in the Emar l?xica or irregular in Nuzi and Alalakh orthography). What we call variants may in some instances owe their forms to a kind of instructional systemization that Pardee sees lacking in application. This does not deny the idiosyncratic nature of Canaanite-Akkadian; Pardee's remonstrations are charitable. But the stu dent's incompetence in Akkadian and the systematic method of instruction are not mutually exclusive elements of scribal education, as any overwhelmed graduate student might confess. Rainey's "poorly learned logogram" may have also been a sometimes perfectly copied logogram. The cuneiform of the scribe is only as good as the cuneiform of his sylla bary.47 A comprehensive study of variant distribu tion by toponym or p?trographie origin could produce patterns that confirm or quash the possibility of re gionally disparate primers with internally consistent orthographies.48 47 Compare Moran's (2003: 266, n. 58) preference to interpret the apparent Assyrianism as ignorance of proper Babylonian. At some point, explanations for serial (and even singular) aberrations should factor in the apparatus of scribal instruction at least to ex clude its possible influence. 48 EA 285 illustrates a problematic case in point. This tablet belongs to the Jerusalem corpus on the basis of its sender, Abdi Heba. Moran (2003: 249-74) uses philological particulars of the Akkadian to illustrate his point that the Jerusalem corpus bears a geographically isolated affinity with the hallmarks of Syrian Pe ripheral Akkadian. The fabric of the tablet, however, does not ex hibit the Moza or cAmminadav p?trographie signatures typical of the hill country anticline (Goren, Finkelstein, and Na5aman 2004: 268-69). The inclusions instead suggest an origin in the Beth Shean vicinity, whither Goren et al. speculate Abdi-Heba might have traveled before dictating the letter to the pharaon. We must concede the tablet's sender to be Abdi-Heba and therefore pre sume either (1) that his scribe accompanied him to the river valley where tablets with local inclusions were accessible, or (2) that Abdi-Heba dispatched his scribe there with a wax draft. We must also presume a local tablet kiln at Beth-Shean, then, as well as a A final piece of evidence is relevant to the ques tion of "pedagogical isoglosses" for want of a more precise sociolinguistic term for regional curricula. While the northern branch of Late Bronze Periph eral Akkadian (including Emar, Ugarit, Egypt, Alash iya, etc.) employs a Middle Babylonian system with marked Assyrian influence, it is Rainey's contention (1996a; 1996b) that several linguistic features of Ca naanite-Akkadian derive from an archaic Old Baby lonian writing system (in contradistinction to the northern branch's Middle Babylonian system with Middle Assyrian overlay). If Rainey is correct, then this relationship must likewise speak specifically to vestigial curriculum (isolated by choice or circum stance). The phonological evidence in particular recommends a serious consideration of Rainey's ar gument. Canaanite conservatisms include the re tention of Old Babylonian initial and intervocalic w (cf. Middle Babylonian w &gt; m), avoidance of Mid dle Babylonian nasalization of geminated dentals, common rejection of predental s &gt; I shifts, affinities with Old Babylonian orthographic representation of sibilants, and other examples (Rainey 1996a: 37-46). He further cites Canaanite's 2c dual pronoun that oth erwise boasts only Old Babylonian and Old Akka dian attestations (1996a: 81-83), as well as the 3ms pronoun s?t (1996a: 62-63). Rainey admits that the latter pronoun, common to Old and Middle Assyrian, may have entered the Canaanite repertoire through contemporary vectors, but he prefers to understand this form as concomitant with other distinguishing evidence for Old Babylonian vestiges. Van Soldt (1998: 596) finds this appeal to Old Babylonian "farfetched," however, in view of the influence from local languages on Peripheral Akkadian elsewhere; his lectio facilior for s?t therefore favors the Assyr ianism. Huehnergard (1998: 61, 63) and von Dassow (2003: 197), on the other hand, seem to treat Rainey's Old Babylonian inheritance with reticent approval. However much peripheral cuneiform scribes con taminated their Akkadian with pidgin codes, one cannot easily isolate variegated Babylonian dialect cooperative local scribe. The unlikely alternative requires a reexamination of Moran's use of EA 285 as evidence for the pe culiarity of Jerusalem's scribe, since Abdi-Heba must then have commissioned this tablet (with its concomitant grammar, seminal syllabary, etc.) downslope from a lowland scribe on hand. The re sultant philological affinities between the Beth-Shean and Jeru salem corpora would thus complicate Moran's presumptive isogloss circumambulating Abdi-Heba's scribe. It is wiser to side with the wax writing board.</page><page sequence="12">12 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 geography from the underlying variegated curricula. Variation in instruction begets variation in execution. EPISTEMIC LIMITS OF ALPHABETIC CUNEIFORM The scribal admixture of Ugaritic, Hurrian, and Akkadian at Ugarit is well known and amply docu mented (Nougayrol et al. 1968). In many ways, Ugarit's geopolitical and maritime position imbued the city with a cosmopolitan character unlike many other polities within the Peripheral Akkadian ambit. This accounts for Ugarit's impressive collection of curricular l?xica (van Soldt 1995). The presence far ther south of Canaanite scribes conversant with al phabetic cuneiform is a more peculiar fact. The Beth Shemesh abecedary, the Taanach tablet, and the Ta bor knife blade might all testify to the presence of either Ugaritian scribes abroad or functional knowl edge of Ugaritic among Canaanite scribes.49 Both possibilities might presume, moreover, the anterior mobility of palace scribes in order to facilitate "first contact" with the Ugaritic writing system. The problem with these extrapolations, however, is the discord in palaeography and abecedary between tra ditional Ugaritic writing and the southern counter parts (Sanders forthcoming). There are variations of a writing system in wide geographic usage, but there is no standard to which these subtraditions cleave. Taken together, these inscriptions testify to the re gional prestige of alphabetic cuneiform, but more im portantly, they document manifold curricula in scribal circles as far south as the lower Galilee, northern cen tral highlands, and Shephelah. If Canaanite scribes learned Ugaritic in order to conduct diplomatic or commercial correspondence with a single city-state, then it is fitting to acknowledge this acquisition of extremely specialized knowledge for expressly com missioned purposes.50 What survive in the archaeo logical record, however, are three epigraphs without an unambiguous cultural horizon to illuminate. Given the variations in the Canaanite specimens, it is diffi cult to see any regional scribal integration beyond local prestige or the ad hoc. 49 One may consult secondary literature under the headings Bet Shemesh 1, Taanach 15, and Tabor 1 in Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002: 756, 761; 2006: 157-66. 50 Note that the Taanach tablet ostensibly deals with remit tance. APPLICATIONS OF SCRIBAL TECHNOLOGY There are attestations of nearly every traditional category of cuneiform writing in Canaan among Middle and Late Bronze Age finds. Administrative texts, letters, l?xica, a literary text, a lawsuit, and omina round out a nice sampling of applied cunei form.51 One hesitates to speak too loosely of ample "genres" mainly in acknowledgment that several texts?l?xica, Gilgamesh, omina, perhaps the Hazor mathematical tablet?all seem to represent curricular staples. The notable text type to go underrepresented in Palestine is the contract. As Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders (2002; 2006) typologize the texts from the Canaanite corpus, there are no unequivocal con tracts prior to the Neo-Assyrian period. There may be a smattering of Bronze Age contracts among the extant corpus (many of these texts are fragmentary or otherwise unintelligible), but their elusiveness is conspicuous (fig. 1). The paucity of contracts should arrest our atten tion. Does form follow function? In most cuneiform cultures, excluding Ugarit, contracts represent the vast majority of retrieved documents. Is there sig nificance to the discordant ratio in Palestine? Acci dent of discovery might account for disproportionate representation. The discovery of the Amarna corpus on foreign soil provides a powerful caveat concern ing secondary context, but one may only appeal to discard patterns for so long. The Amarna, Aphek, Taanach, Tell el-Hesi, Gezer, Shechem, and Hazor letters were elite objects by commission. In cunei form cultures, contracts dominate in part because they are well distributed in private homes and archives. Chance discoveries of elite archives at Taanach and Nuzi tend to skew the distribution patterns with respect to raw numbers,52 but the prevalence of con 51 See Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002; 2006. For gen eral overviews of the Canaanite corpus, see the treatments of Edzard (1985) and van der Toorn (2000), both of whom see mini mal cultural information surrendered in extant texts. The socio economic Sitz im Leben of the epigraphs indeed privileges their narrow content against the holistic, but this is little different from cuneiform corpora elsewhere. Our texts favor us with good data on the social location of writing and writers in the Bronze Age Le vant; that variety of cultural computus is difficult to overvalue. 52 Chance discoveries can also obfuscate cultural practice or idiom.

In Palestine, we have good, large-scale exposures of numerous Late Bronze sites?many with discrete de struction layers, i.e., the optimum conditions for preservation of nonperishable epigraphs, especially tablets?and still the contracts have not appeared in numbers sufficient to draw a parallel with the repre sentation we see in Mesopotamia.53 In other words, m?r?tu, fictive kinship by adoption, permitted predatory credi tors to acquire real property from borrowers.

Again we ask whether the patterns of "genre" representation within the cuneiform corpus from Palestine are meaningful. The question itself is meaningful, in any case, be cause it speaks directly to the relative cultural func tions and applications of writing. Scribal activity appears to be restricted to a small set of applications. In Palestine, scribes appear as royal or elite retainers, and perhaps exclusively so. The Shechem deed with witnesses may represent an exception, but this text is poorly understood.55 It is important to distinguish between the potential appli cations of a technology and the cultural application in practice. Consider the fact that cuneiform as a technology?from its incipient stages at late fourth millennium Uruk to the Early Dynastic periods? serviced contracts, receipts, onom?stica, some lit erature, and the occasional marker of possession. The epistolary application for this technology goes unattested until the 24th century b.c.e. at the earli est.56 As Michalowski (1993: 2-3) notes, however, the early etiologies for writing from the 18th cen tury b.c.e. in fact mistakenly invert the chronologi cal order of application. Six centuries of use permitted scribes and poets to take the epistolary idiom for granted.57 In the Enmerkar myth, for example, the etiology for writing imagines that the cuneiform tab Midrakh cOz, Tell Jenin, Tel Kedesh, Taanach, Tel Jezreel, Tell Dothan, Megiddo, Khirbet Belcameh, Tel Rehov, Beth-Shean, Tell el-Hammah, Tel Iztabba, Beitin, Shechem, Khirbet el-Marjama, Tell el-Farcah North, Shiloh, Horvat Seifan, Ein Sippori, Kfar Yeho shua, Beth-Zur, Jerusalem, Jericho, Moza, Emeq Refa'im, Hebron, Tell el-cAjjul, Tell el-Farcah South, Tel Haror, Tell Jemmeh, Gaza, and Qubur 5el-Walaydah. See the pertinent LB II bibliography in Goren, Finkelstein, and Na'aman 2004: 333-55, which also lists surveyed sites with contemporaneous sherds. The surveys are in consequential for assessing the accidents of epigraphic discovery, however. Only excavated sites are statistically meaningful if one places emphasis on breadth of site exposure; see Faust and Safrai 2005. 54 Note the fascinating exchange between Civil (1980) and Hallo (1990) on the epistemological contours of documentary evidence. 55 See Horowitz, Oshima, and Sanders 2002: 760; 2006: 123 25 for relevant bibliography. 56 The basic corpus of third-millennium letters appears in the treatments of Kienast and Volk (1995) and Michalowski (1993). A few more Old Akkadian letters have since appeared in print, but the dates and content do not alter the chronological pattern of distribution. 57 In the case of the Enmerkar cycle, however, the 18th-cen tury tablets probably reflect copies of a tradition from the Isin Larsa or Ur III period. This would shorten the centuries between let was invented specifically for sending a letter. Af ter numerous exchanges by courier with the lord of Aratta, Enmerkar chooses not to entrust his weighty message to his messenger's memory. "Before that day, there had been no putting words on clay" (Van stiphout 2003: 85), so he invents cuneiform to ensure the verbatim transmission of his message. The his torical inversion makes the epistolary etiology unin tentionally ironic, but the lord of Aratta's response is consistent with the common misgivings that new technologies occasion. The lord of Aratta took from the messenger The tablet (and held it) next to a brazier. The lord of Aratta inspected the tablet. The spoken words were mere wedges?his brow darkened. The lord of Aratta kept looking at the tablet (in the light of) the brazier. (Vanstiphout 2003: 87) The epic portrays the lord of Aratta's hesitation at the use of wedges to convey words as confused phi listinism.58 It is not enough for him to suspect the new medium, but he must also gape at it in astonish ment. The narrative's joke is practically Aristotelian in its contrived epistemological distance between logos and barbarian. No less than the lay reader de fers to the Sumerologist to decipher the epic in good faith did illiterate kings have to concede to the scribe his representation of a tablet's content as read aloud.59 The professionalization of interpretation always in troduces an awkward power dynamic in which trust and mistrust cohabit. As Van De Mieroop (1999: 94 95) notes, few of the approximately 20,000 Old As syrian tablets?many of which are letters exchanged between family members?actually make use of the epistolary medium to convey personal feelings or inquire after loved ones beyond the formulaic. There are notable (often idiosyncratic) exceptions, but most the first cuneiform letters and the Enmerkar etiology for cunei form, but one doubts that the chronological result enlightened the epic's scribes one whit as to the letter's true origins. 58 Vanstiphout (2003: 96) defends the translation of gag as "wedge" against the critique that gag is not the technical Sumerian term: "But that is just the point. How is the lord of Aratta sup posed to have known this?" 59 To say nothing of the fact that diplomatic Akkadian often served as intermediary between the language in which the com muniqu? was "composed" (either orally or written) and the lan guage into which it was translated for reception. Van der Toorn (2000: 100-105) sees tremendous political power vested in scribal autonomy.</page><page sequence="15">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 15 texts are proverbially "all business." As for Meso potamian letters more generally, Stol (1995: 499) quashes the prospects of familial sentimentality with all the tenderness of a Thomas Hardy novel: "No one wrote a love letter."60 In the case of Bronze Age Palestine, where contractual tablets are rare, we may invoke the distinction between the possible applica tion of writing in theory and the cultural application in practice. Van der Toorn is decidedly positivistic about the cultural significance of the Syro-Palestin ian scribal tradition. "Syllabic cuneiform was used for Akkadian," he writes (2000: 108), "and Akkadian was the language of diplomacy and international politics. It was not used to record legal transactions or for purposes of intellectual exploration."61 The model contracts appear in the latter stages of the Babylonian curriculum, but there is no certainty that some Canaanite curriculum followed suit.62 Perhaps orality still functioned as the dominant cultural me dium for contractual agreements in the southern Levant.63 One cannot be sure, but binding oral con ventions of oaths and witnesses indeed surface widely in biblical literature. It is moreover possible to see in the written tablet's witness list a vestigial protocol of oral antecedents. The witnesses bear memorial testi mony to facts beyond the manipulation of interested parties; the written text usurps that function, relegat ing to human witnesses the lesser task of certifying 60 Many Old Assyrian letters employed a simplified syllabary of approximately 150 cuneiform signs (Larsen 1987: 219-20, esp. n. 50), a fact that many have taken as evidence for more easily achieved literacy (especially for private letters). This may be true, but one also notes that the Old Assyrian documents typically fea ture formulaic financial reports and requests pertaining to firm trade in ores and textiles. Although many letters involve unique subjects and learned scribes, much of the basic "trade Akkadian" deals with a limited set of topics or conceptual templates to which a limited syllabary could cater in an ad hoc curriculum. 61 Van der Toorn overlooks the lawsuit tablet from Hazor (Hallo and Tadmor 1977), as well as the legal texts in Akkadian from Ugarit unless he means to exclude the city's corpus from his 'Syro-Palestinian' (his term) sample; note the Ugaritica V cache of Akkadian "textes juridiques" (Nougayrol et al. 1968: 172-87). If by "legal transactions," however, van der Toorn simply means contracts, then he may well be correct. 62 See Bodine 2001 for summary literature on the model con tract as a text type. The absence of Canaanite specimens does not necessarily proscribe their fixture in the curriculum, however. The Amarna and Taanach letters almost certainly rely on the cur ricular use of model letters, notwithstanding the latter's absence in the material record; see Civil's case study (2000) on the epistolary exercise and relevant bibliography. 63 Even within the written contract tradition, one sees varie gation of Babylonian practice with respect to loan types, interest, repayment, and pledges (Skaist 1994). only that the document itself materialized in good faith. The millennial gap between the earliest proto cuneiform ideographs and the epistolary application revisits the characterization of writing as a "technol ogy" (Goody 2000; Ong 2002). Houston and Stuart (1992: 590) dispute the technological metaphor as "it tends to situate script apart from other ways of com municating meaning." Their objection sensibly re acts to the efforts of Goody and Watt (1963), Ong (2002), and Havelock (1986) to infer psychodynamic patterns of human behavior from the structures and shifts of writing systems. The construction of grand sociolinguistic theory from the semiotic isolation of the cuneiform or linear alphabetic scripts falls far outside our present interests (and credulity).64 While the technological metaphor is suspect, however, perhaps it is still salvageable.65 Applied writing af fords political economy certain operative services, notwithstanding its interdependence with other me dia in cultural discourse. We need not reduce the totality of that discourse to the epigraph in order to appreciate what the epigraph may usefully occasion. The determinant for practical technologies is the identification of practical applications and suc cess in execution.66 The mythological imperatives of 64 One laments this impulse to parlay the absence of modern epigraphic "genres" into intellectual critiques. Von Soden (1936) saw in the curricular l?xica an epigraphic testimony to Mesopota mian culture's intellectual deficits; but see the sobering epistemo logical critique of Veldhuis 2004: 81-86. The ambiguity of the designation Listenwissenschaft has facilitated the misrepresenta tion of the curricular l?xica as a boorish philosophical or scientific literature. Larsen's (1987) misguided dependence on Goody (1977) and Ong (2002) perpetuates an insecure subculture of As syriology that continues to reify the fictitious "Greek miracle" at the expense of the Near East's "savage mind." The fact that cu neiform scribal culture did not employ its technology to construct philosophical excurses and dialogues in the fourth-century Athe nian tradition does not lead to the presumption that Mesopotami ans were incapable of abstract speculation. We must distinguish between a technology's synchronie possibilities and functional applications. Philosophy remains a luxury of the academy to this day (if trends in universities' general distribution requirements suggest anything about cultural valuation). The utilities of cunei form in practice do not inform something as subjectively im perious as an intellectual profile, whether profound or vapid, philosophical or incurious. 65 Note that elsewhere Houston (2004) uses the term "technol ogy" with only the slightest hint of self-consciousness, viz., with the occasional application of quotation marks. 66 Note that my characterization of writing as a technology differs markedly from Goody's (2000: 132-51) most recent at tempt to popularize the notion of "technologies of the intellect."</page><page sequence="16">16 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 cuneiform in Enmerkar require the victory of roman tic rhetoric over the banality of accounting. Alan Millard (1998; 1999) has written at length describing the perishable media available to scribes of Palestine?tablets, wax boards, papyri, leather? and he envisions a culture of scribalism that made use of these media to the greatest extent possible or imaginable. He (1999: 321) optimistically recon structs systemic elite emulation in which Canaanite kinglets adopted every conceivable device and appli cation for writing that one may find depicted on an Egyptian tomb. In other words, he exports the full range of Egyptian media and application to Canaan ite elites. This best-case scenario raises an important methodological question. How do we balance a plau sible argument from silence with the need to confront the patterns that the empirical corpus presents? The empirical corpus for late second-millennium Pales tine does not suggest an applied scribal craft beyond the realm of elite commission.67 There is the addi 67 Even in Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, where scribes per formed myriad functions in administrative, entrepreneurial, ritual, and magical capacities, there is evidence of some specialists who owed their livelihood to elite patronage. While many scribes en joyed hereditary introduction to the trade, still others apprenticed themselves at the encouragement of benefactors. Letters 150-152 from Tell al-Rimah (Dalley, Walker, and Hawkins 1976: 122-23) involve a case in which a scribe pleads to his benefactress after she evidently cuts him off from the palace, impairing his ability to work. Toward the end, he even characterizes scribal patronage with a patrimonial simile. I enclose the editors' translation of Letter 150 with my emendations. Speak to my lady: thus Yasitna-abum your servant. May Sha mash and Marduk grant that my lady live forever for the sake of a ghost's son, myself. I am well; but news about the health of my lady has never arrived, and my heart is not alive. In Andariq, you encouraged me not to catch birds (?), saying: "Learn the art of scribes! I shall make you into a household of gentlemen." You made me trust in this business, and you made me forfeit water and broth. You have decided that I, a ghost's son, shall wander around aimlessly in the midst of my own family. You no longer remember that once you gave me con fidence and you strove for me, and you did not have towards me the mercy (expected) of womankind. Do you not know that a ghost's son, even more than a corpse, is deserving of mercy? Now, for the love of Shamash, show everlasting kind ness to a ghost's son. Because I have nothing, I cannot serve in the palace. And what more can I write to tell you? Am I any better acquainted with the matter than you? Do you not realize that a ruler whose (palace) officials are not trustworthy is dis honored in his own palace, and he himself is despised? Do you simply not realize, although I keep writing to you? Just as a father does not reject his own sons, so may my lady uphold me, the son of a ghost. Just as men trust in their fathers and brother, so did I trust in my lady. May my lady not neglect me. tional consideration of the size of Palestine's scribal culture, which hardly suggests the high visibility of writing within this agrarian society. The Amarna corpus contains letters from perhaps a minimum of 18 distinct cities within the traditional ambit of Canaan (Millard 1999: 318). That might index a minimum of 18 Canaanite scribes proficient in cu neiform, although palaeographic, syntactic, and now p?trographie observations suggest the possibility that some city-states shared scribes; sharing implies a lower number of scribes active in the region, and a higher value placed on these specialized retainers. Millard (1999: 318) himself has conceded the possi bility of scribes shared among principalities,68 while Zaccagnini (1983) has offered extensive evidence of professionals (including specialist scribes) gifted, lent, borrowed, and withdrawn among foreign pal aces both for their expertise and prestige value. Then there is the factor of scribes with extrinsic philologi cal affinities, as in the case of Jerusalem, which ad mits further of possible mobility. Were one optimistic enough to double the "minimum number" of scribes to 36 cuneiformists, however, 14th-century Canaan still presents a considerably restricted culture of lit eracy as measured strictly by the number of active professionals. To this picture, add Millard's caveat (1999: 318) that the Amarna letters were "products of the ruling circles in Canaanite towns and the scribes who wrote them were, probably, 'palace' scribes. If they worked for a larger circle of clients, no trace remains." "Whenever we meet cuneiform scribes in Syria-Palestine," adds van der Toorn (2000: 108), "it is in connexion with the palace." I take van 68 His full sentiment is more optimistic, however. "Although some local princes may have shared the services of a single scribe," Millard (1999: 318) concedes, "there is no reason to suppose that was normal." Millard discerns normalcy and exigency with a clar ity that the data do not afford; cf. the petrography of EA 285 (Goren, Finkelstein, and Na'aman 2004: 268-69). We can sur mise, on the other hand, that any practice of lending and borrow ing scribes in fact conformed with accepted conventions. The very transmission of cuneiform throughout the Peripheral Akkadian cultures speaks to elite exchange of scribal professionals, not un like the circulation of artisans (Mora 1992). Kings may lend or be stow peers (or their lessers) with skilled laborers under a rubric of gift-giving that sculpts power dynamics through indebtedness. Negri-Scafa (1992: 240) takes archival prosopography from Arra pha to suggest that scribes sometimes worked itinerantly, traveling to patrons with waiting commissions. "Les scribes exclusivement locaux, rattach?s ? une seule ville, de pr?f?rence p?riph?rique," she writes, "sont relativement peu nombreaux. ... En g?n?ral le rapport scribe/propri?taire d'archiv? semble ?tre plus significatif que le rapport scribe/ville."</page><page sequence="17">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 17 der Toorn to refer to Amarna communiqu?s, since the find-spots of most Bronze Age tablets in Canaan lack demonstrable connections to any palace. The larger point remains, however, that a scribal com mission in Bronze Age Canaan is an elite act; the Iron I commissions were no doubt elite still. In fact, the extant evidence for alphabetic writing during the Iron Age I paints an unambiguous picture of decline in scribal activity relative to the Late Bronze Age, when cuneiform was preponderant. This downturn suggests even more restricted access to writing (now predominantly alphabetic) outside of elite circles during the 12th to 10th centuries b.c.e. LINEAR ALPHABETIC INSCRIPTIONS FROM THE LATE SECOND TO EARLY FIRST MILLENNIUM B.C.E. The West Semitic graffiti in Egypt's Wadi el-Hol bear palaeographic signatures that suggest a date of ca. 2000 b.c.e. for the earliest alphabet. Although the inscriptions themselves date ca. 1800 b.c.e., they nevertheless demonstrate vestigial graphic affinities with both hieroglyphic and hieratic from an earlier era (Darnell 2005). This permits a triangulation of palaeographic points of contact and departure. Like the earliest cuneiform texts relative to the late recog nition of epistolary application, the origins of the alphabet (now dated earlier than before) further chronologically distance its invention from its even tual sophistication. Unlike Ugaritic, which likely refined its own alphabet with inspiration from Akka dian cuneiform, the Old Canaanite alphabet resisted standardization during the second millennium despite its proximity to both cuneiform and hieroglyphs. The absence of an intentional political program safe guarded the randomness of Old Canaanite writing as well as its common unintelligibility to epigraphers. In the light of Wadi el-Hol, Sanders (2004: 33) con trasts the ambiguously understood Old Canaanite alphabet with the programmatic cultivation of its Ugaritic counterpart. This new knowledge of the alphabet's history has at least two cultural consequences: first, it destroys the image of the alphabet's inevitability. For the first half millennium or so of its history, the main attested use of the alphabet was for marginal people?for eign soldiers and laborers?to write graffiti in des olate, out-of-the-way places. In the second half of this millennium the alphabet blossomed into a wide range of forms, most of which did not survive into the next. ... A second consequence of the new history of the alphabet is to link forms of writing with political programs. Alone among the early alphabets, the only one that can be consistently read is the variety of alphabetic cuneiform that was standardized and produced in mass quantities at Ugarit. This is a di rect result of the activity of the Ugaritic state. West Semitic-speaking intellectuals conducted their first major cultural project with an alphabet for the pur pose of creating a native Ugaritic literature. Here Sanders emphasizes the circumstantially spe cific applications of the early alphabet(s),69 a point of intrigue which intersects with our present interest in the cultural utility of inscriptions and inscribing in Iron I Palestine. In order to clarify the socioeconomic dimensions of scribal culture during the late second and early first millennia b.c.e. (during and after the eclipse of regionally preponderant cuneiform), dis cussion will proceed to an inventory of the relevant alphabetic texts in order to clarify patterns of usage prior to the state's emergence. The bibliography for this corpus is too vast for full citation, and the dates of several texts are now disputed in the light of the Low Chronology (Sass 2005), which I abjure for the present. I will restrict focus largely to evidence for scribal commission and function with the belief that any pending chronological corrections will not undermine the cultural conclusions drawn from the corpus.70 Lachish Fosse Inscriptions The Late Bronze Fosse Temple supplied two in scriptions of note in linear alphabetic script. From a ceramic assemblage chronologically straddling Structures II and III comes a bowl with characters brush-painted in white lime (Diringer 1958: 129). The legible portion of the inscription (which pre cedes an indecipherable ending) reads bslst, "In/by three ..." which likely indicates a quantification of the dedication's particulars (its dated occasion, 69 See further the important observations of Millard (1991) on the uses of the early alphabets. 70 See Sass 1988: 53-105 for a fuller inventory of linear al phabetic inscriptions from this time period. I have omitted from my list epigraphs that are unintelligible or uninformative with respect to their function.</page><page sequence="18">18 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 inventory of items, or volume). By Tufnell's strati graphic reconstruction, the bowl is perhaps a little older than the ewer inscription, although the palaeo graphic affinities overshadow however little distance in time separated the epigraphs. Excavators discovered the fragmentary ceramic ewer inscription in the Fosse Temple's late 13th century phase (Diringer 1958: 130). The letters are painted concentrically within a band of serial zoo morphic images (including the common Late Bronze palm-and-ibex motif). There is a lacuna in the in scription's center, however, where a fractured sherd was not recovered. While the missing elements are disputed, there are clear characters reading mtn ("Mat tan" [the benefactor] or "gift") at the beginning and % C?Elat" [the goddess]) at the end. Notwithstand ing the lacuna, therefore, the common tendency to view the ewer as votive is justified. This is a prestige item (perhaps naming the donor) from a ritual context dedicated to a divine character. Lac his h Bowl Fragment This bowl fragment from Lachish bears an incom plete inscription in alphabetic Old Canaanite script from the late 13th century b.c.e. (Cross 2003: 293). Its extant text includes the apparent name of a di vine character or venerated ancestor &gt;il&gt;ib in the first line, and the phrase bys* hwsb in the second, where Cross reads "in the gallery, he installed (it)." Here is a votive offering which specifies its intended recip ient and the attendant piety that (and of whom, the lacuna perhaps attested) the same beneficiary might acknowledge in gratitude. Khirbet Raddana Handle The late 13th-century inscription on the jar handle from Khirbet Raddana preserves only three discern ible letters before a break, but Cross and Freedman (1971) make a good case for the preservation of a partial personal name or hypocoristicon in the extant letters 'hi. The handle inscription must therefore in dicate the owner of the vessel, or its donor were it dedicated to a shrine. Qubur yel-Walaydah Bowl Fragment From Qubur 5el-Walaydah comes a votive bowl, comprised of two major fragments with a clear join, bearing the names of two donors: Simi-pacal and ^Iyya-^el. The dextrograde text follows the personal names with a sin and another character maimed by the bowl's right break. Cross (2003: 216) imagines that this sequence could refer to votive s?/si ("sheep" after common Ugaritic attestations) or seqel with the broken character perhaps standing for either a num ber (s 10) or a nun for n[tn /DN]. He dates the bowl palaeographically to ca. 1200 b.c.e. Beth Shemesh Ostracon The ink-blurred ostracon from Beth Shemesh (Grant 1930) dates a little later palaeographically than the inscriptions from the Lachish Fosse Temple, which places it roughly in the 12th century b.c.e. (Cross 2003: 324-25). The reading is disputed, but the reverse clearly indicates two personal names. Cross makes a persuasive argument for additional personal names on the obverse, fronted by a marker of possession?thus (1) /VA (2) ybskr, et al. Indeed the initial lamed is legible in the upper left-hand cor ner even in the final report's scratchy photograph (Grant 1931: pi. 10). Izbet Sartah Ostracon The 12th-century inscribed ostracon from cIzbet Sartah (Demsky 1977) features an abecedary that con tributes significant typological data both to the palaeo graphic development of the linear alphabet and the pedagogical diversity of scribes who reproduced it. The pe-cayin sequence accords with the Lamenta tions acrostic and the abecedaries from Kuntillet cAjrud against the Lachish abecedary and the "con ventional" order of the biblical Hebrew alphabet (see above). The cIzbet Sartah inscription furthermore exhibits a het-zayin sequence that now finds a paral lel in the Tel Zayit abecedary. These features testify to pluriform primers, however diversified geograph ically or cross-communally, during the larger Iron Age continuum of scribal Kulturgeschichte. Revadim Seal The seal discovered on the premises of Kibbutz Revadim bears an inscribed scaraboid image with anthropomorphic figures and a reversed text read ing l}b\ "Belonging to Abba" (Giveon 1961). Cross (2003: 299-302) dates this status piece, carved from hard limestone, to the late 12th century b.c.e. The inscribed scene seems to depict two humans attend ing a seated man or child. Giveon and Cross differ on the possible interpretations of the latter, but the</page><page sequence="19">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 19 broader attribution of divinity or royalty to the center figure is probably certain enough to safeguard the seal's prestige value to its bearer, Abba. Arrowheads from El-Khadr and Parts Unknown Assorted inscribed arrowheads from the antiqui ties black market have made their way into public and private hands over the past several decades. The total number of unprovenanced objects is fifty with one additional specimen retrieved from a dis turbed burial cave (there are numerous other unin scribed congeners). These objects bear Northwest Semitic possessive formulae incised into bronze with the object (hs, "arrow") and the owner named. In most instances, the personal name precedes a fa milial relation (patronym or fratronym), title (re tainer, chief, king), or affiliation (e.g., "Sidonian"). The palaeographic diagnostics range from the very late 12th (or very early 11th) through the mid-10th century b.c.e. The principal examples came to light in 1953 putatively in a farmer's field in El-Khadr near Bethlehem (Milik and Cross 1954), whence the farmer or an intermediary dispersed them to different dealers in Jerusalem and Amman. Cross (2003: 217) reckons that 5 inscribed and 21 uninscribed arrow heads from this original cache are now identifiable as a coherent corpus. Due to the genre's count in creasing by a coefficient of 10 since the early 1950s and the typically illicit means of retrieval, the rele vant bibliography is extensive. Deutsch and Heltzer (1999: 13-19) have collected these items in a single publication, however, which doubtless contains au thentic and dubious items alike.71 The consultation of such a publication occasions certain caveats. Rollston (2003; 2004) has now authored the first systematic discussion of proper protocols for assay ing unprovenanced epigraphic materials. He suggests that the absence of provenance feature prominently in published analysis as a measure of credibility. Roll ston (2004: 75-76) further advises a rating system that indicates the probability of authenticity. The lat est trends in forgery detection recommend extreme caution, if not qualified incredulity, toward all recent inscriptions of unknown origin. Each unprovenanced 71 See also the inventory of Cross (2003: 200-202), who ex ercises commendable caution with respect both to the opportunities afforded potential forgers and credulity to "spurious" specimens published by Deutsch and Heltzer (1995). epigraph is suspect to some degree. The burden of proof rests on the dealers and their black market affiliates to prove the authenticity of their wares; it does not fall to the epigrapher to disprove the au thenticity of an unprovenanced object which might, under the best of circumstances, be accorded the re spect of "legitimately stolen" goods. There is good reason to note the implausibility of forgery for many arrowheads, especially the early collection from El Khadr, but we cannot bestow this grace to all such artifacts. As Cross (2003: 200) warns, "The appear ance of spurious or forged arrowheads on the market is most troubling; procuring old arrowheads is not difficult, and the increased interest and value of such pieces no doubt tempts the modern manufacturer of antiquities, notably professional forgers of seals, to satisfy the demand." Recent advances in forging technology and craft cast a pall over black market items appearing in the past generation. Arrowhead specimens of later discovery therefore carry a graver stigma. Our concern here, however, is largely the recognition of a possessive template with bearing on scribal commissions: "Arrow of PN son/retainer of PN." This template cross-pollinates the suspect and less suspect pieces alike as one would surmise for a marketplace of imposture. Elite commission of scribal inscriptions extends also to elite retainers, who name their lieges on the arrowhead. Prestige ac crues both to the retainer as "man of so-and-so" and to the patron with men thus bedecked with status sigla. The affectation of the prestige inscription, therefore, might have provided the Iron I scribe a hook to diversify his commissions (if not his clien tele, provided the pretentious patron does not also commission inscriptions for his retainers).72 72 The Lokop spear industry in north-central Kenya provides an intriguing, non-epigraphic parallel. Blacksmiths operate on the economic margins of this pastoral society, an exigency that presses the need to develop deliberate survival strategies. The cli entele and commissions for weapons from any one kin affiliation are infrequent, so the blacksmiths have identified clients with means (and the airs of elitism) across kin groups as a distinct con sumer class. "In their vaguely defined and peripheral status, black smiths can be seen as the 'brokers' of style," Larick writes (1991: 313). "On the surface, they make utilitarian weapons. Their real skill shows, however, in their ability to recombine varied traits of size, shape, and decoration into meaningful spear morphology." This customization of spear style carries prestige value among the Lokop warrior cohorts, who "effectively collaborate with black smiths to set up their own future place as elders" (Larick 1991: 327). Blacksmiths survive by marketing their craft to a targeted clientele with status pretenses.</page><page sequence="20">20 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 Byblian Inscriptions Three inscribed objects from Byblos feature an 11th-century Phoenician script with bearing on this inventory. The first two are clay conical objects, each of which records the owner's name: lcbdhmn and Vtfmls bbd, respectively. The reading in the second name is disputed (Cross and McCarter 1973; Teixi dor 1977; Gibson 1982: 12), but the categorical con clusion remains that these inscriptions indicate possession. The third object of note is the Azarbaal Spatula (KAI 3), which Cross (2003: 228-29) dates a little later in the 11th century than the inscribed cones. The small bronze item in the shape of a spat ula bears an inscription, possibly a palimpsest, of no little controversy. Dunand (1938) originally claimed that the contents betrayed a commercial transac tion?a view revived by Gibson (1982: 9), who en visions little more than a banal monetary exchange or request for repayment. Iwry (1961) sees superra tional properties supposed for belomantic recourse in legal disputes, while McCarter and Coote read in the text a refusal to bestow a land grant to a subordinate. They write (1973: 19), "That a legal disclaimer was involved here accounts for the choice of writing ma terials. The selection of a metal spatula, even though it was being reused, indicates that the information recorded was meant to be preserved." This suggests awareness of the contingency of further consultation should the dispute be resurrected. Shea (1977) adopts some of McCarter and Coote's philological correc tions to construct a hybrid interpretation of a trans actional document detailing the conveyance of real property. So long as the content indeed concerns a party equipped to effect the transfer of a nhl, "patri monial estate,"73 then we may ascribe elite status to at least one of the text's principals. With new high-resolution photographs taken in cooperation with the West Semitic Research Project, Rollston (personal communication) has tentatively entertained the possibility that the spatula inscrip tion's mention of a nhl suggests scribal verse about the patrimonial idiom or ethic.74 The notion that the spatula text could be proverbial or lyrical is in triguing in view of the pedagogical use of proverbs in Akkado-Sumerian curricula (Falkowitz 1980; Veldhuis 2000). Indeed, the biblical book of Prov 73 So McCarter and Coote 1973; and Shea 1977. 74 See Adele Berlin's (1996: 205-6) patrimonial interpretation of Psalm 133, which may involve a political lament for a subdi vided estate. erbs perhaps owes its initial compilation to the use of apprentice duplication exercises. In any case, it is too early to group the poorly understood Byblos spatula with the Gezer Calendar (see below) in a schoolboy mnemonic genre, but that does not forestall the pos sibilities that this bronze inscription was a prestige object, belonged to a scribal elite, or found use as a functional primer, albeit with assumed airs. Manahat Sherd An Iron I burial cave near Jerusalem's satellite village of Manahat revealed a potsherd inscribed after firing (Stager 1969). Stager (1969: 48), who with John Landgraf co-discovered the object, notes that the incised sherd likely constituted part of a complete funerary vessel rather than an ostracon. Landgraf (1971: 93) dissents, however, preferring to envision an already broken sherd inscribed and reemployed as a potter's sculpting tool. The text reads Isdh, which expectedly indicates the vessel's owner, here likely the decedent provisioned with grave goods pertinent to "anthropomorphic" needs in the hereafter. Stager (1969) and Cross (2003: 229) date the script to the 11th century b.c.e. on the basis of few but helpfully diagnostic letters (especially the lamed and sin). Kefar Veradim Bowl Evidence from Cave 3 at Kefar Veradim suggests a Middle Bronze Age burial site disturbed to accom modate five later Iron Age burials. An assemblage of Iron II pottery littered the excavation area. The rep ertoire included various bowls, kraters, jugs, lamps, and Black-on-Red juglets typical of the early Iron Age IIA (Alexandre 2002a). Among the grave goods stands out one fluted bronze bowl which mourners interred upside down next to the head of one of the decedents. An inscription incised into the bowl's in terior reads ks psh bn smc "Cup of Psh son of Sema" (Alexandre 2002b). The high quality of the bowl and its commissioned engraving unveil the elite status of the interred owner. The script is ostensibly Phoeni cian?with a close artifactual parallel in the Tekke bowl (Sznycer 1979)?although it also predates the period in which we can confidently speak of mean ingful palaeographic departures of the so-called na tional scripts from the Phoenician Mutterschrift. Alexandre (2002b: 68*-69*) prefers a 10th-century b.c.e. date, privileging the contextual ceramic as semblage over the inclination of Cross (2003: 227 29) and others to date the Tekke bowl to the 11th</page><page sequence="21">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 21 century. I should prefer a ballpark tenth- to early ninth-century date in view of the Black-on-Red ware;75 the Veradim bowl seems typologically ear lier than both the Gezer Calendar and the Old By blian lapidary inscriptions (neither of which boasts secure stratigraphie credentials). If a diverse range of abecedaries characterized the Iron Age I-IIA, which I suspect was the case, then minor palaeographic variants or inconsistencies should occasion neither alarm nor compelling dates. This bowl may repre sent the first tenth-century West Semitic inscription discovered in situ; one exemplar does not a palaeo graphic benchmark make,76 although the Zayit abece dary now helps to flesh out matters an iota. Tel Zayit Abecedary The final week of the 2005 excavation season at Tel Zayit produced a partial abecedary incised on limestone (Tappy et al. 2006). Tappy proposes a tenth-century date on the basis on the inscription's in situ stratification with a concomitant ceramic as semblage sealed beneath material with later radio carbon dates. McCarter proposes a mid-10th-century date on the basis of palaeographic features more advanced than the Kefar Veradim bowl and more archaic than the Gezer Calendar (with the exception of the full-headed mem, which signals a more pro gressive trait). The abecedary is remarkable for the following letter orders: waw-he and het-zayin. Other notable features include a possible pe-(ayin sequence, although the stone is too damaged for certainty, and a lamed-kap sequence, which McCarter considers an error (demonstrable by concomitant "editorial" marks). The waw-he sequence is otherwise unattested in West Semitic abecedaries and consequently a pos sible marker of scribal individualism. The het-zayin sequence, on the other hand, validates its cIzbet Sar tah correspondent (see above) as an authentically su praregional convention rather than a local aberration. In short, the Zayit abecedary exemplifies the notion of 75 I am comfortable with the continuation of these ceramic wares into the ninth century (Byrne forthcoming). 76 The Veradim bowl's dotted &lt;ayin cannot on its own secure an 11th- or even 10th-century date. The feature's attestation at Fekheriyeh demonstrates the acrophonic principle in aesthetic practice. The fact that the name and meaning of the letter cayin were never forgotten counters the notion that palaeographers must read the scribe's graphic addition of the eye's pupil (the dotted cayin) as an archaism. This caveat has negative consequences for the dotted 'aym's diagnostic relevance for the alphabet's transmis sion to the Greeks. viable alternative primers among scribal cultures in the decentralized Iron I political economy.77 Gezer Calendar The inscribed limestone tablet from Gezer (KAI 182) is well known and thoroughly studied.78 It is a good epigraph with which to conclude this survey, in part because of its common description as a scribal exercise or mnemonic. By self-acclamation, Albright (1943: 21) was the first scholar to characterize the tablet as such when he wrote, "Judging from Egyp tian and Mesopotamian parallels, the text before us can be only a school exercise. With this agree the size and the material of the plaque, which is just large enough to be held comfortably in the hand of a 12-year-old boy, and which shows the rounded edges and sides resulting from considerable use." Notwith standing the quaint imagery, Albright's instincts were reasonable; and numerous other epigraphers have since read the tablet as an apprentice's homework on more rigorous grounds. Haran (1998: 89) neverthe less assails this interpretation of the Gezer Calendar, which "can only doubtfully be considered the exer cise of a schoolboy, just because it is hardly conceiv able that, with all the poverty and simplicity of living conditions in biblical Israel, students were forced to scratch their homework on stones."79 Haran also cites incisions on ceramics prior to firing as dubious candidates for school activity. These are fair cri tiques of inscriptions taken for student exercises, but the medium in question does not necessarily rule out 77 I would hesitate to characterize this particular epigraph as a primer, but rather as a text indirectly derived from knowledge of such a primer. This inscription is evidently a graffito. If McCarter is correct about the erroneous execution of the lamed-kap se quence, then one doubts that this inscription enjoyed use as a model for proper transcription (i.e., "proper" relative to the local curriculum). 78 The editio princeps is Gray, Lidzbarski, and Pilcher 1909. Nearly a century has passed since the inscription's publication, with the expected accumulation of unwieldy secondary literature. See the summaries of Cross and Freedman (1952: 46-48), Gibson (1971: 1-4), and Pardee (1997: 400-401) for representative analy sis and bibliography. 79 Haran's critiques are especially pertinent now for the lime stone Tel Zayit abecedary if it indeed records an exercise (or even a graffito). There are no prescriptive conventions on the valuation of media, however, even now as the writ contends with the elec tronic. In view of the mutually alien conventions that separate modern and ancient cultures of literacy, one might leave the ques tion of a medium's tactile or aesthetic viability to its user. Scribes did in fact incise limestone irrespective of their taste for it.</page><page sequence="22">22 RYAN BYRNE BASOR 345 the possibility that the tablet was rather a primer it self?a template document inscribed on durable material perhaps in anticipation of repeated use. At the end of the day, however, the aura ?f uncertainty recommends against decisive use of the inscription for argumentative gain. Its cultural import is fatally ambiguous. THE PRESTIGIOUS RETAINER The grammarians Strunk and White (1979: 57) disparage the adjective "prestigious" with the fol lowing remarks: "Often an adjective of last resort. It's in the dictionary, but that doesn't mean you have to use it." Their objection no doubt concerns the cos metic surgery that transforms noun into adjectival neologism. Or perhaps "prestigious" raises hackles because it confers unearned repute upon the nomi native bearer. In its ancestral connotations of "illu sion" and "imposture" (&lt; Lat praestigia "deception"), prestige is an artifice rather than an entitlement. There is considerable history chronicling the presti digitations of elite culture to radiate status through material acquisition of objects and persons alike for display or intellectual predilection (Helms 1993). Vir gil thrived with imperial patronage. Mozart barely survived giving music lessons to girls of aristocratic families. Having resigned his professorship at the Graduate Theological Union, Daniel Matt (2004: xxvii) now translates the Zohar at the behest of the Pritzker family. As for a largely subsistence-based political economy in which alphabetic writing oper ated on the periphery of socioeconomic necessity, its scribes found refuge in the entourages of "Great Men." The Iron I corpus of applied alphabetic writ ing consists of two basic categories: prestige objects (possessive, martial, votive, funerary) commissioned by elites, and curricular instruments used to pre serve the very profession of scribalism during an era in which it existed on the margins of dominant ex change patterns. Epistolary applications of writing are unknown, however possibly camouflaged by ac cident of discovery or perishable media. On the other hand, the political and economic conditions that typically occasion long-distance epistolary contact between elites are not consistent with the political economy (or social location of scribalism) of Iron I Palestine. We do not expect letters, but any that should surface would further establish the sender's prestige in an era when such correspondence denoted a luxury. In the extant aggregate, the epigrapher sees a restricted clientele to which scribes needed to ap pear relevant in order to remain relevant. Warlordism ranks far below the ideal form of intellectual patron age, but it does afford survival. The scarcity of the craft, moreover, inflated the value of the scribal re tainer and the prestige that accrued to the sybarite with wherewithal to retain one; lesser elites no doubt had to borrow or share cuneiformists even during the Amarna period. Scribes could convey as status gifts in elite exchange (in both the suzerain/client and peer varieties), which accounts both for the Hittite edubba and Babylonian Adapa tablet in Egypt.80 The import of writing for status is especially visible when an elite culture boasts the retention of prestige ob jects constructing prestige objects. Surviving Mayan inscriptions exclusively repre sent elite commission (Schele and Freidel 1990: 55). The elite prerogatives of scribalism surface in a royal conquest stela and murals, which depict the rit ualistic mutilation of captured scribes of rival kings (Johnston 2001). Prior to his sacrificial execution, the scribe endured a public humiliation in which his fingers were ceremonially broken as a metaphor for his master's silenced propaganda. "Although cap tured scribes were tortured and executed," Johnston writes (2001: 380), "what captors chose to empha size in public documents was not the physical elimination of the scribes through sacrifice but the destruction through finger mutilation of their capac ity to produce for rivals politically persuasive texts." The political prestige of the mutilation owed its res onance to the prestige of the scribe and the unique ness of his craft. So too the khipukamayuq retainers manifested and projected the power of their Inka lords, who commissioned these specialists to con struct and decipher narrative records on woven khipu strings (Quilter 2002). Before the rise of the uni versity system in medieval Europe, scribes received commissions outside the clerical scriptorium almost exclusively from aristocratic patrons, who welcomed 80 Zaccagnini (1983: 250) documents this phenomenon in de tail, writing "The sending of specialized workers is well attested in the framework of the diplomatic relations between the 'great' kings and, to a certain extent, between the 'great' and 'small' kings of the late Bronze Age. The skilled workers who were sent from one court to another were viewed as prestige goods, and their transfers are inserted into the dynamics and formal apparatus of the practice of gift-exchange." In EA 49, the king of Ugarit requests from Pharaoh two Africans and a physician, whom Zaccagnini (1983: 251) sees "placed on the same level: exotic curiosities to be shown at court among the king's entourage." This was especially true of diviners, i.e., scribes with specialized training in the b?r?tu literature.</page><page sequence="23">2007 THE REFUGE OF SCRIBALISM 23 (or contracted) their own family hagiographies (Shop kow 1997). These scribes routinely sought such com missions, moreover, with unsolicited encomia to prospective masters. The unprovenanced Iron I arrowheads indicate that they belonged not only to powerful men, but also to their retainers, whose inscribed equipment in turn enhanced the patrons' stature. The uniformed chauffeur or butler mirrors (and brandishes) his em ployer's affluence as a matter of protocol. The sur vivability of the alphabetic haute couture in the centuries after the ebb of Canaanite cuneiform iron ically hinged on its own irrelevance, i.e., in its rele vance to those who could afford the luxury. Perhaps this illuminates a peculiar pericope about the pri mordial monarchy. In each of David's entourage lists (2 Sam 8:16-18; 20:23-26), the king boasts a single scribe (Seraiah and Sheva, respectively). Some have taken this to represent a larger bureaucracy (or worse still, an Egyptian derivative), but the text makes more sense at face value. David retains a scribe when scribes are curiosities. The narrative is less interested in the hint of a chancery (certainly an anachronism) than the accentuation of a status retainer fashionable for the time. These scribes were less administrators than hagiographers. BRINGING THE STATE BACK IN The medievalist John Baldwin (1971: 35) axiom atically observed that "Schools suffer first and most severely when law, order and stability break down in society." The perils posed to the scribal trade during periods of political entropy underscore the comforts of institutionalism lost and regained. The movement in political anthropology to reintroduce the state's relevance (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985) partly represents a backlash against structuralist tax onomies and Annales anti-historicism, but it also reflects concern about the wholesale subordination of agency to society in the name of grand cultural theory. The state that Aretxaga (2003: 394) calls "a screen for political desire" elects to instrumental ize technology in advance of its self-authenticating agenda: mandarin projections of legitimacy, account ing of and for expropriation, etc. The scribal culture of linear alphabetic does not emerge to service the inchoate Iron Age state, nor does it immediately di versify its functions upon the state's emergence. The expanding application and refinement of the writing system speak to the adaptability of both the political and scribal cultures in their increasingly intimate dis course. As Sanders (2004) reconstructs the picture at Ugarit, systemic cultivation is an introspective, self conscious operation of the state; so too must the lapidary Old Byblian corpus reflect the Phoenician coordination of writing technologies with the objec tives of maritime commerce and political prestige. The later Iron II trajectory toward Hebrew script standardization highlights what linear alphabetic is not during the late second and early first millennia. It is not standardized, nor is it consistently intelligi ble, precisely because it subsists during this period on elite wherewithal rather than political or economic exigency. The state facilitates the alphabet's segue from a curiosity to the sine qua non. The movement toward a uniform Hebrew abecedary attests to insti tutional cultivation, as the post-exilic consolidation of intellectual authority facilitates an arbitrary choice of one alphabetic order at the expense of epigraphi cally attested Iron Age also-rans.
