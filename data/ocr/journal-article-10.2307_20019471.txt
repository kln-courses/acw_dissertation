<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 27, pp. 239-257 SCOTT DAVIS IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII Toward the end of Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, Philo cata? logues the 'frivolous observances', 'rapturous ecstasies' and 'bigotted cred? ulity' of'vulgar superstition', concluding that 'true religion, I allow, has no such pernicious consequences : But we must treat of religion, as it has com? monly been found in the world' (Hume, 1947: 222-3). This would be a mild enough sort of caveat were it not nigh on impossible to determine exactly what counts as true religion, and how it figures in Hume's argument. Typically, answers to this puzzle have required identifying the positions of the discussants, and then arguing that one of them represents Hume's views. A catalogue of the options may prove instructive. Far and away the most frequent candidate for Hume is Philo. This is the move taken by Kemp Smith, who holds the positive results of Hume's argument to be ' so neutral and colourless... that we cannot help asking why, having advanced so far, he has stopped so abruptly', and concludes that the explanation lies 'in certain considerations peculiar to the period in which Hume lived', (Hume, 1947: 25). Hume, on this reading, endorses the de? structive conclusions of the earlier dialogues, but cannot bring himself to give voice to the whisperings of his philosophical soul. Religion he knows to be an empty shell, more often than not a hinderance to the betterment of human community, but he holds out the hope of ' true religion' for those still wedded to the deity. This seems consonant with Carl Becker's classic sketch of the Enlightenment ethos. Becker wrote, famously, that to read the Dialogues in the context of eighteenth-century deistic optimism 'is to experience a slight chill... as if, at high noon of the Enlightenment... one were suddenly aware of a short, sharp slipping of the foundations, a faint f?r-off tremor running underneath the solid ground of common sense' (1932: 68). He implies that the attack on the Enlightenment God, if only Hume had seen fit to publish, could not but have called into question the reason that God guaranteed. More recently, however, interpreters have questioned the simple identifi? cation of Hume with Philo, and what they take to be the superficially negative conclusions o? Dialogues I-XI. James Noxon argues that Philo the character must be distinguished from Hume the author, and concludes that 'Philo's recantation in the final Dialogue is quite plain and in perfect accordance with Hume's usual strictures... Philo's scepticism is excessive scepticism, or Pyrronism, a position which it is impossible to maintain</page><page sequence="2">24O SCOTT DAVIS consistently' (Noxon, 1964: 380). Hume's mitigated scepticism, on this reading, forces him to consider the positions of all the characters, and if all three reflect the vagaries of personal preference then perhaps that is as far as unaided reason can go. Noxon closes with the tantalizing suggestion that ' the thorny path of scepticism led Hume back to the domain of Calvinism from which he had exiled himself long before. But it is unlikely that he recognized that country upon his return ' ( 1964: 383). In a similar vein Keith Yandell distinguishes between 'natural theology' and 'natural religion', drawing appropriately on the evidence of Hume's Natural history of Religion. He argues, with considerable persuasiveness, that humans have a natural propensity for religion, which generates beliefs no more optional than our other beliefs, and that the systems generated by this propensity will needs be accepted, even when they cannot be established by the arguments of natural theology. This distinction, he concludes, 'explains the (merely apparent) shift' in Philo's position (Yandell, 1976: 119). Particularly illuminating is Yandell's suggestion that more attention should be given to Demea 'as a forerunner of or "pr?parer for" positions Hume will weave into Part XII' (124, n. 34). This he follows up by noting 'an interesting similarity between Hume's view that there is a propensity to theism and Calvin's claim that all men have a "seminal knowledge" of God' (124, n. 44). A suggestive hint indeed, opening the door to a reaffirmation of the need for faith dependent upon the grace of God. Something like this seems to have happened in late eighteenth-century Germany. Isaiah Berlin has brilliantly sketched the role of Hume's scepticism in fostering what we might call a glaube movement, exalting Hume 'as the apostle of non-rational faith' (Berlin, 1977: 109). But, of course, how the next generation appropriates his views need not be the best guide to interpreting Hume himself. J. C. A. Gaskin steers a middle path, rejecting Noxon but not quite em? bracing Hume the anti-religious terror. ' There is no hint ' he writes, ' that he ever views religion from within as a way of life, a metaphysic of existence, a worthwhile thing to which total commitment is possible' (Gaskin, 1978: 173). But Gaskin does not find this an assault on religion. Instead he sees Hume's contribution as not altogether discontinuous with Locke's in mar? king the limits of rational belief by showing ' what a modest thing a rational man's religion would be and how diffidently it should be held' (1978: 174). This is but a sampling of the critical spectrum, intended to point up the uncertainty surrounding any interpretation of Hume's Dialogues. Coming to grips with this uncertainty continues to find voice in the journal literature (cf. Coleman 1989). How are we to take Philo's apparent embrace of true religion? Until we understand what he embraces how can we grasp the impact of the earlier arguments? Everything, it would seem, hinges on Dialogues XII. But if this is true then the readings sketched above are doubly unsatisfying. Not only are they mutually contrary and hence inconclusive,</page><page sequence="3">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 241 but they generate an ' extrinsic ' account of the text, relying too heavily on unstated intentions.1 Have we missed a clue, in the Dialogues itself, that might provide more insight into Hume's thoughts on natural religion? Is not Stewart Sutherland right in thinking that Philo's final remarks are ' clearly laced with the sauce of irony?' (Sutherland 1982: 133). I want to follow up Sutherland's suggestion with a reading of part XII on which Philo's con? clusion follows straightforwardly from the positions he maintains throughout, but on which the nature of ' true religion ' is such that his conclusion must be seen as one of thorough-going irony. First, however, we will need a bit of stage-setting. The debate of the Dialogues presupposes the results of early modern science, from Copernicus to Galileo to Newton. The New Science promises explan? ations approaching mathematics in their rigor. In doing so it provides exceptionally plausible canons of rational explanation. It is Cleanthes who makes the most impassioned case here, in his denunciation of the Pyronnian sceptic : In reality, would not a man be ridiculous, who pretended to reject Newton's explication of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow, because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light... And what would you say to one, who having nothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and Galileo for the motion of the earth, should withhold his assent, on the general principle, that these subjects were too magnificent and remote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of mankind (Hume, 1947: 136). All beliefs, he urges, should strive to meet the conditions of rational expla? nation set by natural science, and any attempt to avoid those standards should be exposed as a species of unreason. According to Cleanthes' scientific paradigm, theories are in competition for the evidence for experience. Rational choice requires that we prefer greater explanatory power in hypotheses, and explanatory power is determined by facts explainable. If two hypotheses explain the same facts on the basis of the same evidence, then there is no rational choice between them. To reject the scientific achieve? ments of the previous century is the height of irrationality ; science has set the standard. The question is how well natural religion measures up to this agreed paradigm. If nothing can be said for it then it cannot be reasonably 1 Readings that rely on the social context or on Hume's literary intentions are aptly criticized in Coleman (1989), and she would no doubt criticize the reading I am about to suggest as well. But if the irony is there, and if it plays a role in making Hume's philosophical point, then it cannot be neglected. Perhaps the issue between us would be captured in the opposing poles of the debate over the ' intentional fallacy'. The 'intentional fallacy' broke upon literary critical horizon in W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley's famous article ofthat name and became the rallying cry of what is now the old New Criticism. Many foolish things were said in the ensuing critical debate, which served, unfortunately, to stifle discussion of the interesting philosophical issues. In this regard the old New Critical debate closely resembles the contemporary Deconstructionist debacle. The original article and a number of very good responses are collected in Newton-De Molina (1976).</page><page sequence="4">242 SCOTT DAVIS adopted. But, Cleanthes goes on to argue, the 'religious hypothesis' can be articulated, and the weight of evidence is on its side. He invokes Locke for the claim that faith is 'nothing but a species o? reason, that religion was only a branch of philosophy, and that a chain of arguments, similar to that which established any truth... was always employed in discovering all the principles of theology, natural and revealed ' (1947: 138). For further corroboration we may have recourse to Newton himself, who enjoined us ' to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances' (Newton, 1953: 3), and on the basis of his own studies concluded that this ' most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being' (42). From Newton to Locke to Leibniz and Clarke, the principles of natural philosophy confirm the principles of theism. On this much at least Philo, Cleanthes and Demea agree. The question remains as to what this admission means for natural religion. At least one constraint to be met by natural religion, begins Philo, is that of fitting intelligibly into the fabric of the common life, and this means that the language of religion must mesh with everyday discourse in one way or another. Thinking about God, however, seems so far from human experience that we risk losing all ability to speak intelligently. When we reach this state it seems that scepticism triumphs by forcing a suspension of belief (1947: 136). It is important to be clear about what is going on here. Philo's suspension of belief results from the inability to determine what is evidence for what. Thus it is not the conclusion, nor does it stem from the failure, of any particular argument about the nature or existence of God. Philo's initial suspension of belief reflects nothing more than the application of the basic requirement of rational belief, namely, that belief can be adopted only when it is the present victor in the competition of hypotheses. If the discussion is to get off the ground it will be necessary to give some account of how we can talk about God. All of Hume's characters agree that the existence of God is not in question, but if God's nature exceeds the resources of human language the titles we apply to the deity have no connection to the ordinary uses or implications of those terms (1947: 142). What is at stake? If there is no connection between the terms of common life and the terms of religion, then no action in common life follows from anything said 'religiously'. If there are no correlations of action and religious belief then the impact of religion derives its force from authority alone, the 'priestcraft' all three deplore. For this renders religion only as worthy as the authorities who propound it, and such a position is neither religiously nor rationally acceptable. Thus the arguments of natural religion must be intelligible from the perspective of ordinary experience as well as meeting the conditions for rational theory choice. Responding to the first condition means invoking 'analogy', extending the application of terms to an object or set of objects</page><page sequence="5">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 243 based upon those causal relations we recognize in experience. But the causal complexity of the world is such that intermediate and contributive causes must be similar in nature to license any inference to likeness of effects (1947 : 147). When I stroked the cue ball the first time its impact moved the 7-ball, so when I strike the cue ball a second time, all things being equal, its impact will move the 9-ball. The closer the analogy, the more plausible the dem? onstration; the more distinctions between the antecedent causes, the less plausible the inference to effects. Any argument that moves, as the argument from design does, from world to God will stand or fall on the quality of the analogies. There is no reason here to present a detailed account of the argument from design, but a sketch of the debate will prove useful. Cleanthes begins by noting that an unbiased examination of nature uncovers action in accord with mechanical rules. 'All these various machines, he exclaims, 'and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them' (1947 : 143). This mechanism must stem from an imposed order such as the insensate world can scarcely provide. Analogy forces us to conclude that ' the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed' (1947: 143). To Philo's objection that such an argument is defi? cient in certainty, Cleanthes first invokes the greats of early modern science, Copernicus and Galileo, on the need to clear away the blinding residue of an older cosmology and goes on to offer a further analogy, that of the book. The investigation of nature reveals that it can be described in the formal language of science. It we had a complete scientific account of nature, which is at least possible, we would have a book that described the way the world is. But if you enter a room and discover a book it is a proper inference to believe that the book had an author (1947: 153). Given the much greater complexity of the world than any single book, it stands in even greater need of an author. 'Could you persist in asserting', Cleanthes presses Philo, 'that all this, at the bottom, had really no meaning... Even your sceptical play and wantonness would be abashed at so glaring an absurdity' (1947: 153). Note that it is Cleanthes who insists on relying solely on arguments a posteriori and that he is the one to introduce science and its heroes as the paradigms of rational belief. The alternative, as he archly retorts to Demea, is ' mys? ticism', the denial that anything can intelligibly be said about God, and mystics differ in no practical way 'from sceptics or atheists, who assert, that the first cause of All is unknown and unintelligible' (1947: 158). To refuse any positive claims about the nature of the deity, as both Philo and Demea seem to advocate, rests on a form of religious paranoia about the dangers of anthropomorphism. To satisfy the claims of reason we must begin some? where, and since the certainty of a priori argument, so prized by the math</page><page sequence="6">244 SCOTT DAVIS ematician and the logician, is not available in this realm of investigation, we must give the best answers we can and 'let those go farther, who are wiser or more enterprising' (1947: 163). An area of belief appropriate to the person of reason must admit of discussion, and the discussion should be carried on at the appropriate level of rigor. Here we should be content with the claims of the best available hypothesis, and doing so leaves us no worse off than the practitioners of science. Religion, Cleanthes concludes, simply is the best hypothesis consonant with knowledge and experience. This conclusion presents itself as the heart of reasonableness. It makes no excessive claims for or against the powers of the intellect, nor does it carry the stigma of crude self-interest we often associate with Pascal and his wager.2 Nonetheless, Philo counters, it does rest on the analogy between the human and the divine, and having drawn the analogy Cleanthes is committed to its consequences. Since the argument is stronger the liker the terms, then plausibility is directly related to similarity. But as soon as Cleanthes accepts this principle he loses all claim to infinity, perfection, uniqueness and any other properties not to be found in humans. For all we know many worlds may have come and gone, many Gods have tinkered with the design (1947 : 166-8). Even worse, the principle of analogy would seem to drive Cleanthes inexorably toward a perfect anthropomorphism. 'Why not' Philo proclaims, ' assert the Deity or Deities to be corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears; &amp;c?' (1947: 168). To stop anywhere short on the chain of similarities both weakens the force of the analogy and lacks any justification free from arbitrary whim. 'In a word, CLEANTHES,' Philo admits, 'a man, who follows your hypothesis, is able, perhaps, to assert, or conjecture, that the universe, sometime, arose from something like design. ' But this is small comfort, for 'beyond that position he cannot ascertain one single circum? stance, and is left afterwards to fix every point of his theology, by the utmost licence of fancy and hypothesis' (1947: 169). If our goal is a rational belief, free from mysticism and fanciful speculation, the argument from design, based on analogy, will not do. In fact, the situation is even worse, for Cleanthes provides no better evidence for thinking the cosmos a great machine than for viewing it as some immense cosmic vegetable, or the offspring of some tremendous animal, moved by its own sustaining soul. The evidence is as good for the one as the other. ' Suppose this world to be an animal, ' invites Philo, ' a comet is the egg of this animal; and in like manner as an ostrich lays its egg in the sand, which, without any farther care, hatches to egg, and produces a new animal ; so...' (1947: 177. Ellipses are Hume's). It is of no use for Demea here to object that these suppositions are 'wild' and 'arbitrary' for that is Philo's 2 The classic statement, with developments and related materials, may be found in Brody (1974, 227-72). For some interesting interpretations of Pascal, probability and the rationality of religious belief see Hacking (1975) and the use made of this by Stout in his 1981 work.</page><page sequence="7">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 245 point. Our inclination to see the world as a machine is the product of contemporary inclination in just the same way that the myths of the pagans reflected the cultures that produced them. But if there is no 'other rule than the greater similarity of the objects compared' (1947: 177), then the veg? etable and animal hypotheses are at least as tenable as the analogy with the machine. Had he but known it Philo could have cited Newton, from a letter to Oldenburg, 1672: if anyone offers conjecture about the truth of things from the mere possibility of hypotheses, I do not see by what stipulation anything certain can be determined in any science; since one or another set of hypotheses may always be devised which will appear to supply new difficulties. Hence I judged that one should abstain from contemplating hypotheses, as from improper argumentation... (Newton, 1953: 6). The argument from design, as an attempt to discern the nature of God, runs afoul Newton's censure of hypotheses. All the facts support multiple hypoth? eses as to God's nature without suggesting any experiment that could shift the weight from the organic, say, to the mechanical. There seems to be a prescient echo of Newton in the remark that 'all religious systems, it is confessed, are subject to great and insuperable difficulties', from which Philo concludes that 'a total suspense of judgement is here our only reasonable resource ' ( 1947: 186-7) .3 The scientific paradigm Cleanthes so optimistically embraced has, Philo takes pains to emphasize, turned on him. After a brief and bootless attempt to plead the case for a priori arguments Demea shifts to the argument from experience, offering the thought that 'each man feels, in a manner, the truth of religion within his own breast; and from a consciousness of his imbecility and misery, rather than from any reasoning, is led to seek protection from that Being, on whom he and all nature is dependent' (1947: 193). Demea's shift reflects a crucial change in the direction of the argument. Philo's assault on analogy has not been directed against a particular cosmogony so much as against the possibility of articulating a preference among the competitors. As long as the evidence speaks equally for all, nothing can guide choice other than mysticism, whimsy or 'systematical prejudice'. Demea attempts to avoid the conclusion that the reasonable person must undertake a suspension of belief by shifting the burden of proof from those who would persist in belief, such as himself, to those like Philo who would force the suspension. To do this he introduces a distinctly different notion of rational belief from the one previously at work. For the first nine sections of the Dialogues Philo, Demea and Cleanthes have been operating under the paradigm of rational theory choice taken from the 3 I say 'precient' in the absence of any evidence that Hume knew Newton's correspondence. The letter in question appeared in the Opera Omnia, published between 1779 and 1785. That Hume's target in the Dialogues are those divines who adopted Newton's physics over that of Descartes because 'it carried none of the atheistic implications of materialism... God had his proper place in Newtonian physics, and so there was no conflict with theological interests' (Shepherd, 1982: 82), seems to me part of the irony in Philo's conclusion. This, however, is an extension of my argument, not a premiss.</page><page sequence="8">246 SCOTT DAVIS heroes of the New Science. Allegiance to the best explanation is intended to capture the demand that a choiceworthy hypothesis defeat its rivals in the court of experience. What Demea now suggests is that religion, in one form or another, is natural to the human condition. It is not so much an inves? tigation continuous with the natural sciences as a response to the impact of the moral world on individuals and communities. Not only that, but religion plays a recognizable role in the fabric of our lives distinct from that of the sciences, since science, after all, is something we can do without. Philo, responding to Demea here, suggests that the shift takes us away from the realm of rational belief, to one where ' a talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more requisite than that of reasoning and argument' (1947: 193), but this is a ploy Demea should, and does resist. People do not reflect on their beliefs in a vacuum. Inquiry presupposes possession of a complex fabric of belief, disposition and practice from which, when asked, we can usually provide some sort of answer for particular beliefs and prac? tices. Religion, on Demea's account, is an integral part of this fabric, not a casual or merely personal avocation. Thus, should someone ask why he attends church on Sundays and high holy days Demea can respond that these are the ways of worship thought proper by Christians. On the face of it this is a perfectly rational response. But the questioner might press the point in one of two ways. He might ask why Demea worships in the way of the Christians, which presupposes that he acknowledges the propriety of wor? ship. To this Demea could respond by giving him an account of why he thinks Christian worship reflects the nature of things. This would be a matter of tracing the history of the Christian community and providing the cir? cumstances which led to its adopting the beliefs and practices it holds.4 On the other hand, Demea's interlocutor might take a different tack. He might ask why Demea thinks it important to worship God at all. Here we should pause to notice two points. First, Demea is under no rational ob? ligation to respond to this query, since it seems on the face of it to be grounded in ignorance. Either the questioner does not understand the nature of Demea's God or he has not quite grasped the meaning of'worship'. Or it may be a combination of the two. But for Demea to acknowledge the God of his tradition is to recognize a creator, judge and benevolent father whose actions have a direct and immediate impact on our lives. Worship is the general term for displaying the respect appropriate to such a being, and to be ignorant of that is to be deficient in culture. No one is under a rational obligation to remedy the defects of others in this respect. Demea can, in short, reiterate his initial response and wonder how it is that his questioner fails to be acquainted with these terms. 4 I am not suggesting that any single version of this would commend itself to Demea, though it would be possible to map the likely strategies. Hans Frei has done something like this in The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, to which I direct the inquisitive reader.</page><page sequence="9">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 247 But the ignorance may be innocent and Demea may, as an act of dia? lectical supererrogation, expand upon his original answer. Here, and this is the second point, he need not feel obliged to provide a full and complete account of his practice, nor even one which will persuade the questioner of its truth. Few of us are in a position to provide a complete account, whatever that might mean, of any of the concepts and practices that make up our lives, but that does not mean they are defective, or that we are not entitled to use them. The standard of reasonable explanation is maintained if our account is acceptable to other mature members of our community. This sounds suspiciously relativistic, but it is not. The extreme sceptic renders his position absurd by making life unlivable, and when Philo acknowledged this, in Dialogues I, he properly recognized the standards of the community. Simi? larly, when Philo attacked the claims of analogy he was relying on the standards of rational theory choice he took to be operative in the debate at hand. Demea does nothing more than this in invoking the practice of his community, but this strategy is a strong one nonetheless. When Philo invokes Leibniz as an example of one who denies the significance of human misery Demea rightly asks, 'can any man hope by a simple denial (for the subject scarcely admits of reasoning) to bear down the united testimony of mankind, founded on sense and consciousness? (1947: 194)- No. Demea's shift places the burden of proof on the prosecution before a jury drawn from the com? munity itself. So, when he offers the argument from misery as a reason for seeking God, Demea goes beyond the demands of reason in the sense of providing what he is under no obligation to provide. He doubtless thinks the argument com? pelling but should it turn out otherwise that need not bring his own beliefs into question. Anyone of common sensitivity must feel the awful tragedies that attack even those deemed prosperous, not to mention the poor and disen? franchised. 'Were a stranger to drop, in a sudden, into this world,' Demea declaims, ' I would show him, as a specimen of its ills, an hospital full of diseases, a prison crowded with malefactors... a nation languishing under tyranny, famine, or pestilence' (1947 : 196). Thus the very limits of life in the world drive people to seek comfort in a benevolent god, who insures that the miseries and injustices of this life 'are rectified in other regions, and in some future period of existence', and it is with this expectation that people 'trace, with adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity, through all the mazes and intricacies of his providence' (1947: 199). This web of beliefs, connecting God and the future to life in the present, reflects the inherited wisdom of the tradition. It is not intended as an argument for one hypothesis to the exclusion of others, a point missed by Cleanthes, who responds with great animation: 'No! These arbitrary suppositions can never be admitted, contrary to matter of fact, visible and uncon trover ted. Whence can any cause be known but from its known effects? Whence can any hypothesis be proved</page><page sequence="10">248 SCOTT DAVIS but from the apparent phenomena?' (1947: 199-200). Cleanthes continues to operate on the supposition that the sciences provide the unique standard for accepting belief, and that we have some sort of intellectual duty to submit all of our beliefs to the tribunal of this science. But neither of these positions is compelling. Demea need offer no further argument. Triumph, however, is short lived, and Demea's shift proves to be attended with its own difficulties. For at this point Demea is joined once again by Philo, who, it seems, is willing to agree with him in shifting the burden of proof and in dropping the exclusive claims of science to rationality, but who now exploits the very grounds to which Demea himself has shifted. Unlike science, which we can take or leave as it suits the goods of the community, our notions of evil and responsibility are woven ineluctably into the fabric of our concepts. Demea himself has admitted as much. To live a human life is to band together in community and to deliberate about choices for the future and their impact on the good of that community. While a God who does not satisfy the constraints of scientific theory building need not be a matter of concern, a God whose benevolence does not fit with our notions of responsibility is. And this is why the problem of evil has power against Demea in a way that the failure of the design argument does not. If Demea's God fails to keep us from the many evils already catalogued is he impotent or malevolent? We need not require that God make us perfect, but he seems not even to have made us as well as we might imagine. This should be troubling to Demea because here we have a case where belief may be found wanting by a jury of believers. Remember that Demea has already rejected the Leibnizian strategy of theodicy as a matter of irrelevant, specialist philos? ophy. He is committed to treating friendly apologetics such as the free-will defence with similar disdain. The free-will defence may satisfy the logical constraints of the philosophers but it does not satisfy the practical demands of the believing community. It is not the philosopher but the ordinary believer who harbours doubts about divine benevolence. Experience is too 'mixed' to justify calling the deity malevolent, but neither does it justify applying our ordinary sense of benevolence. ' The uniformity and steadiness of general laws seem to oppose ' the idea that ' the first causes of the uni? verse... are opposite and have both goodness and malice', which pushes us to embrace a fourth possibility, ' that they have neither goodness nor malice ' (1947: 212). Is it any wonder that Demea cries 'Hold! Hold!' and accuses Philo of ' betraying that holy cause, which you seemingly espoused ? ' ' Are you secretly', he now wonders, 'a more dangerous enemy than CLEAN? THES himself?' (1947: 213). The answer would seem to be yes, but not because of the attack on the argument from design. By accepting Demea's shift, and then arguing that the common believer himself has good grounds for questioning the benevolence of God, Philo has raised a doubt internal to the community. And it is here, as opposed to the fields of science or phil</page><page sequence="11">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 249 osophy, that Demea must address the challenge. It is not surprising that he ' did not at all relish the latter part of the discourse ; and he took occasion soon after, on some pretence or other, to leave the company' (1947: 213). I will return to Demea's departure, but for the moment let us continue with Philo and Cleanthes. Parallel to what I have been calling Demea's shift, Cleanthes now executes a shuffle of his own. Granted that the debate so far has pointed up the limits of the argument from design, and granted that the problem of evil poses a serious difficulty, there remains nonetheless a prudential argument for re? taining religious belief. Even if theism cannot be established absolutely it is at least plausible. Human nature and the common life require some intel? ligible system of order and constraint. Because it sustains the moral life even a corrupted religion is better than none at all. ' The doctrine of a future state ', he concludes, ' is so strong and necessary a security to morals, that we never ought to abandon or neglect it' (1947: 219). This argument is so familiar that we are in danger of not seeing how radical it is. Demea's shift insisted that we were justified in maintaining a belief until we had been given a compelling argument, on our own grounds, for abandoning it. Cleanthes' shuffle goes further, claiming that we are justified in maintaining, and perhaps even insisting upon a belief about which we ourselves are in doubt if it serves some other, independently laudable end. This is the first great irony of Dialogues XII. Demea's last reported words lament that Philo may be the greater danger to religion than Cleanthes, but now Demea is shown to be wrong. For Philo at least insists that the intellect be subject to the constraints of the world as it finds it. Cleanthes advocates becoming the arbiter of how the world should be, and of arranging our beliefs in order to secure our own vision ofthat world. But this is the most irreligious of beliefs, and it suggests that Demea was right about Cleanthes all along. Just as Cleanthes desired to remake the fabric of belief earlier in the Dialogues to conform to his own notion of what scientific rationality demanded, so he is now willing to mold that fabric to his own vision of moral stability. Both God and morality are subject to his prudence. But this is particularly ironic given the oft-reiterated point made by all three characters, that human wisdom is circumscribed by finite capacities and limited experience. Demea's shift merely insisted that science does not make truth, but only reports the truthful findings of particular investigations. The propriety of worship re? flected the goodness of acknowledging a God who might not be accessible through those investigations. Cleanthes seems to say that the search for truth can and should be shaped by his own sense of propriety. This leads immediately to a second irony. Once Cleanthes invokes pru? dence and the orderly arrangement of society, he falls under the judgement of history. If religion truly sustained the moral life then there would be no practical argument against it. But all religion in practice has been 'vulgar</page><page sequence="12">25O SCOTT DAVIS superstition', presided over by duplicitous authorities. 'How happens it then', asks Philo, in one of the great pieces of philosophical rhetoric: if vulgar superstition be so salutary to society, that all history abounds so much with accounts of its pernicious consequences on public affairs... If the religious spirit be ever mentioned in any historical narration, we are sure to meet afterwards with a detail of the miseries which attend it. And no period of time can be happier or more prosperous, than those in which it is never regarded, or heard of (1947: 220). A more sweeping denunciation of religion can scarcely be imagined. Clean? thes' attempt at a response only extends the condemnation. For true to his instrumental view of religion as an institution which 'only enforces the motives of morality and justice' Cleanthes willingly moves to keep it from becoming ' a separate principle over men ', and insists that when religion does so act it 'has become only a cover to faction and ambition' (1947: 220, reading 'morality' for 'mortality' in accord with Chappell and Popkin). Religion proper regulates morals. But among the common people and in the sphere of history religion always comes packaged with a congeries of super ethical rituals, regulations and dispositions. It is these adventitious accruals that distinguish Catholicism and Islam, Hinduism and the religions of the tribes. The historal religious traditions, Philo suggests, give rise to the socially destructive phenomena he catalogues, ' and so will all religion... except the philosophical and rational kind' (1947: 220). Short of philosophical religion, denominational adherence not only offends the intellect, but encourages all manner of viciousness. In the political order necessary to human activity, religious asservations should be judged by common morality, not the other way around. And even such tolerance is unstable, since 'no morality can be forcible enough to bind the enthusiastic zealot. The sacredness of the cause sanctifies every measure which can be made use of to promote it. ' That Philo has keyed this argument to Cleanthes' appeal to prudence peeks coyly out of his closing fillip, that ' steady attention alone to so important an interest as that of eternal salvation is apt to extinguish the benevolent affections, and beget a narrow, contracted selfishness' (1947: 222). Herein speaks the friend of Adam Smith. The force of Philo's argument seems unmistakable. Religion is a blight on the human community, too vicious to embrace and too dangerous to ignore. His bow to ' true religion ' is no more than deference to Cleanthes' impossible ideal. And this reading would be perfectly adequate to the text did Philo not conclude the Dialogues by asserting that: a person, seasoned with a just sense of the imperfections of natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity... To be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian (1947: 227-8). A remarkable turnabout. Not only does Philo proclaim himself a Christian, but one inclined to embrace revelation as a result of his philosophical skepticism. Demea, we may think, departed a bit too soon. At the same time,</page><page sequence="13">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 25I the jarring juxtaposition of this conclusion to the critique of Dialogues I-XI, coupled with the moral denunciation of Dialogues XII, might well incline the reader to one of the ' extrinsic ' explanations canvassed at the beginning of the paper. Textual studies show, after all, that this last, puzzling paragraph is an addition from the final year of Hume's life. Perhaps, as Noxon hints, Hume was in the process of rediscovering a gracious God. Maybe, as Yandell suggests, Hume remains an enigma even to himself. But this easy way out is belied by Boswell's famous interview, shortly before Hume's death, at which the professional sycophant found Hume 'indecently and impolitely positive in incredulity' (Hume 1947: 78). The worry remains : Is Hume himself being cautious, cowardly or duplicitous in this final endorsing of Christianity? The answer, as I have already suggested, is none of the above, and I will now undertake to display the final irony of Hume's Dialogues. Philo has agreed that the existence of God is not in question. The issue is what else can be said about God and the impact what we can reasonably say might have on our common life. If religion is to be more than the single assent to the existence of God it must include worship, of some sort. But what, for Philo, can worship amount to for the reasonable person? It cannot be 'vulgar superstition ' or any of the faiths and denominations who think their own peculiar slant rightly reflects God's wishes for creation. They are seekers after salvation, whose zeal ' easily eludes all the general precepts of charity and benevolence' (1947: 222). God, Philo insists, does not get angry or seek the constant reassurance of a devoted public. 'It is an absurdity', he concludes, ' to believe that the Deity has human passions, and one of the lowest of human passions, a restless appetite for applause' (1947: 226). Philo's Christianity, then, must be theism without denominationalism, committed to those pre? cepts of charity and benevolence. But that is not all. In a passage which, according to Kemp Smith, Hume added, deleted, then added again, Philo remarks that ' To know God, says Seneca, is to worship him. All other worship is indeed absurd, superstitious, and even impious' (1947: 226). This citation has, to the best of my knowl? edge, received no comment but it is a peculiar one nonetheless. Unlike the rest of Hume's classical references, none of the Dialogues' editors have suc? ceeded in tracing this one, despite the fact that the author clearly deliberated at length as to its propriety. The intrigue heightens when we realize that its meaning is not altogether self-evident. It seems to be modelled on the hackneyed 'to know him is to love him', which would suggest that as soon as we recognized the existence and nature of God we would naturally be inclined to worship him. A pedestrian notion, but a reasonable one none? theless. It is not, however, Seneca's. The best candidate for Hume's source is letter 95 of the Epistulae Morales : Let us forbid men to offer morning saltuation and to throng the doors of temples ; mortal ambitions are attracted by such ceremonies, but God is worshipped by those who truly know Him... God seeks no servants. Of course not; he himself does service 10 RES 27</page><page sequence="14">252 SCOTT DAVIS to mankind, everywhere and to all he is at hand to help. Although a man hear what limit he should observe in sacrifice, and how far he should recoil from burdensome superstitions, he will never make sufficient progress until he has conceived a right idea of God, - regarding Him as one who possesses all things, and allots all things, and bestows them without price (1925: 89).5 ' Deum colit qui novit. ' Seneca's God is that of the stoics, a God dead set against vulgar superstition, denominationalism and the viciousness of reli? gious politics. Worship consists in believing in the gods, their majesty, goodness and command. 'Whoever imitates them', Seneca concludes, 'is worshipping them sufficiently' (1925: 91). To do this requires no more than following Nature, who ' produced us related to one another, since she created us from the same source and to the same end... Let this verse be in your heart and on your lips : I am a man ; and nothing in man's lot do I deem foreign to me. ' A finer example of Hume's allusive art can scarcely be found. To discover the meaning of worship we must follow the thread from Philo to Seneca, who is quoting Terence. This done we find that worship is nothing other than the practice of stoic virtue : ' Satis illos coluit, quisqu?s imitatus est.' But Philo's subsequent remark renders this reading impossible, or at least incomplete. For in insisting that no other form of worship is acceptable he implies that knowing God is itself a form of worship. Indeed, Philo states in terms drawn directly from Seneca that it is the only form in which the Deity is not degraded ' to the low condition of mankind, who are delighted with entreaty, solicitation, presents and flattery'. And Philo continues, heaping scorn on both the philosophical theists, 'who entertain, or rather indeed endeavour to entertain, suitable notions of his divine perfections', and on the philosophical sceptics, 'a sect almost equally rare, who, from a natural diffidence of their own capacity, suspend, or endeavour to suspend all judgment with regard to such sublime and such extraordinary subjects' (1947: 227). The philosophers, theist and skeptic alike, revolve in their own delusions. Is anything left? The next paragraph, itself an addition to Hume's final, 1776 revision, provides the key: If the whole of natural theology, as some people seem to maintain, resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined proposition, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence: If this proposition be not capable of extension, variation, or more particular ex? plication : If it afford no inference that affects human life or can be the source of any action or forbearance... What can the most inquisitive, contemplative, and religious man do more than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition, as often as it occurs (1947: 227). All natural theology rests on assenting to the proposition that the deity is the 5 I owe this reference to my colleague in the Classics Department, Professor Anthony Boyle, to whom I had recourse after my own attempts produced nothing remotely plausible.</page><page sequence="15">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 253 source of order, and that it bears some ' remote analogy ' to our own intel? ligence. The only acceptable form of worship is the attempt to know God. But if God is accessable only through his effects, then knowledge of God comes only through the study of that causal order. Since all extensions beyond study are 'absurd, superstitious, and even impious', the student of that causal order must be the proper worshipper, making as he does 'dis? coveries of the nature, attributes, and operations of the divine object of our faith'. And if the deity 'would be pleased to dissipate, at least alleviate, this profound ignorance, by affording some more particular revelation' (1947: 227), they will be delivered by the true heroes of the unbiased intellect, the naturalist scientists. When we disambiguate the first principle of natural theology, the true Christian turns out to be the practitioner of science, whose findings are the only revelation we can have of the divine, and who preserves his commitment to charity and benevolence by eschewing any form of religious practice other than science. Here we have Hume's true religion. 'A little philosophy', Cleanthes had quoted from Lord Bacon, 'makes a man an atheist ; a great deal converts him to religion ' ( 1947: 139). The irony now appears that the religion to which he converts is the practice of the laboratory, the proper locus for rational worship. We are given no hint that Cleanthes grasps the irony of this conclusion, but it is clear that Pamphilus, Hume's ingenue, does not. Philo, he thinks, wins out over Demea but it is Cleanthes who prevails. Let us think about this for a minute. The education of Pamphilus provides the occasion for Hume's Dialogues. At stake is the future reasonable and benevolent society. In this preface Pamphilus identifies the topic as ' the ground of all our hopes, the surest foundation of morality, the firmest support of society, and the only principle which ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations ' ( 1947: 128). In this Pamphilus represents the mainstream of enlightenment thought, for whom, as Becker writes ' the very foundation of the new philosophy was the existence of God... inferred from the observable behavior of the world ' (Becker, 1932 : 67). Pamphilus inability to grasp the conclusion of the Dialogues reflects the inability of this optimistic tradition to recognize the conclusions that follow from premisses they themselves accept. And if Pamphilus displays his own intellectual limits here we should be on our guard against others of his judgements, particularly on the relative success of the three disputants. Earlier I postponed discussing the significance of Demea's departure at the end o? Dialogues XL To most commentators Demea's departure seems a victory for philosophy over the cramped confines of an upper-middle class piety, what Pamphilus describes as a 'rigid inflexible orthodoxy' (1947: 128). At last the smug satisfaction of Demea's early smile receives its come? uppance. But is our philosophical self-satisfaction justified? I doubt it. If Demea's shift reflects an alternative account of rational belief, where the burden of proof lies with the prosecution against the judgement of the 10-2</page><page sequence="16">254 SCOTT DAVIS community, then Demea should not feel pushed into Philo's suspension of belief. He would only be defeated if he allowed that his community should judge itself by the standards of Cleanthes' empiricism. But why should he do that? From the perspective of his own community Demea is entitled to conclude, as in fact he does, that both Cleanthes and Philo are enemies of religion. And indeed this is correct. He can adopt a position which, in contemporary terms, is not unlike that of the ' reformed epistemologists ', who argue the superiority of Reid's commonsense philosophy and its critique of Hume.6 Rationality, Demea can insist, 'is always situated rationality' (Wol terstorff, 1983: 155). His departure need signify nothing more than his unwillingness to be co-opted into a dispute which offends against his sense of proper theological dispute, and in this he would follow Calvin, and anticipate Alvin Plantinga in affirming that the 'Christian does not need natural theology', and 'ought not to believe on the basis of argument' (Plantinga, 1983: 67). This is not, when properly understood, irrational: it signals a reasoned refusal to believe that rational belief is the exclusive domain of Cleanthes' scientific paradigm. This is not to say that Demea has no problems confronting early modern science and its legacy. If he wishes to operate within the academy Demea may have to endure the accusation of non-rationality, but such a trial may be part of the demands of faithfulness (cf. Wolterstorff, 1983: 177). In any event, it is Pamphilus, and by extension Cleanthes who prove to be obtuse. Neither grasps the import of the steps by which Philo eliminates all rivals to science as the exclusive form of rational worship. Demea's departure is a sign of insight. Cleanthes and Pamphilus are left holding the bag. Were this the end of it, however, Hume's irony would be merely a parochial victory over his 18th century Scottish antagonists. But the very possibility of treating the question of belief with irony points up a funda? mental transformation in the context of belief. For what, after all, is irony? Northrop Frye, with characteristic insight, discerns irony ' whenever a reader is not sure what the author's attitude is or what his own is supposed to be' (Frye, 1957: 223). Something has happened, an event has been presented, which leaves the reader up in the air, not because the author has failed in the presentation, but because the reader is sure that he has succeeded and still does not know what to think. Swift's Modest Proposal, for example, ' has a brain-softening plausibility about it: one is almost led to feel that the narrator is not only reasonable but even humane : yet the " almost " can never drop out of any sane man's reaction' (Frye, 1957: 224). Irony requires that 6 There is not the space here to follow up the suggestion that Demea maintains a position on both commonsense and religion not unlike that of Reid. It is tempting, and provides a certain sense of interpretive closure, to see Demea as Hume's caricature of Reid, or more likely of Reid's followers, such as Beattie. I have not pursued this, however, and recommend Sutherland (1982) and Marsden (1983) as guides to the sources. Plantinga &amp; Wolterstorff (1983) reflect the growing importance of Reid and thus perhaps, pace Hume, of Demea in contemporary philosophy of religion.</page><page sequence="17">IRONY AND ARGUMENT IN DIALOGUES, XII 255 there be a tension between the possibilities for action, which is reflected in our uncertainty about how we should interpret the author. Devouring the surplus population would, after all, 'solve' the problem of poverty. But is this a solution we could tolerate? Could Swift intend to be taken seriously? The more we know about the world and the author's place in it, the more we cannot quite bring ourselves to believe what he seems to be saying. And as with Swift so with Hume's Philo. Is science joined to virtue a form of worship? Only if religion has undergone a profound change of meaning, such as that evident in Cleanthes' instrumentalism. For Cleanthes religion has become a cog in the well oiled machinery of contemporary society. It is subordinated to the needs of that society and can be modified as those needs change. Whatever ceases to agree with the standards of propriety and good taste may be eliminated as a superstitious accretion to the true faith. But this is a familiar situation that goes well beyond Hume's Edinburgh. In fact, Hume opens a window on the origins of what becomes the liberal tradition in religion, transforming not merely the Presbyterianism of his youth (cf. Suther? land, 1982), but European religion in general. Cleanthes may easily embrace the movement among his German contemporaries to 'reform' Judaism, supported by Moses Mendelsohn and found in its most extreme form in Solomon Maim?n. In its Christian forms it is a movement against which John Henry Newman (1968: 216-25), and still later Karl Barth, will react in their very different ways (cf. Busch, 1976: 60-125). To appreciate the irony in Philo's conclusion is to realize that whatever you call it the religion in which Cleanthes instructs his charge is something very different from what came before, and plays a very different role in the life of the individual and the community. The traditional believer, like Demea, does not recognize the irony because he sees only caricature, and ultimately apostasy, in the posi? tions of both Cleanthes and Philo. Newman will insist on the teaching authority of the Church against this autonomous liberalism. Barth will later reject it as substituting human willfulness for the word of God. But these are developments yet to come. Cleanthes asks for a religion appropriate to a community of educated, modern believers and he gets what he asks for, but it turns out to be not at all what he wanted. It's tempting to think that Hume hopes we remember the first paragraph of Seneca's epistle, where he cites the saying 'don't ask for what you'll wish you hadn't got' (Seneca, 1925: 59). Given the bases from which it starts the conclusion of the Dialogues follows systematically from what came before, and confirms what we otherwise know of Hume's attitude to religion. Of course, he does not anticipate the counter-movement that broadly encompasses Newman, Barth and the Reformed Epistemologists, thus Cleanthes is left to carry the banner of religion among the intelligentsia. Far from being a merely parochial attack on the believing culture of its time, then, the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion isolates what will become a</page><page sequence="18">256 SCOTT DAVIS fundamental and divisive attempt to reinterpret religion for the modern world.7 This takes me back, finally, to Hume's earlier commentators. Noxon and Gaskin, in particular, read Hume as carving out a space, however circum? scribed, for religious belief, and in a sense they are right. But they themselves are subject to the same ironies as Cleanthes, for they fail to see that that space is bought at the expense of religion making any difference in life. Unless we are willing to accept Cleanthes' shuffle, and reinterpret religion instru mentally, perhaps as a form of therapy, it has nothing to do, having been replaced by the practice of the natural scientists. The more philosophically astute Demea realizes that to enter the debate on Philo's terms is, from the outset, to resign the field. He reaffirms the significance of religion, even if it does cost him his place in the dialogue.8 School of Religion, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089-0355 REFERENCES Becker, Carl.
