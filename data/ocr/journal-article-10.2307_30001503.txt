<plain_text><page sequence="1">Travellers, Cartographers, Lovers: Ideologies of Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry Maryna Romanets In an ambivalent Irish cultural matrix, with its multilayered psychohistori- cal and sociocultural patterns deposited in literature, the topos of the island is underlaid with multiple connotations: it reflects Irish insular psychology; it is the point of destination in numerous seafaring quest narratives; it figures as one of the key symbols of Celtic mythology; and it has been reduplicated in Irish literary heritage since ancient times, making poetry analogous to sailing. The poets have been navigating incessantly along the channels of Irish psychohistory to this place of origin - the territory set apart and insulated from the rest of space - whose internal consistency allows it to attain the existential status of a world and is instrumental in making it a site of autoreflexivity. Although defined as an island, this is rather a non-place, a heterotopos that is more an idea about space than any actual place,1 an elusive spatial continuum and a marker of the desire for 'beyond'. This transient space, unattainable though imaginable, charted by the routes of multiple voyages captures a convoluted nexus of imagination, ideology, and power. Through a discussion of the topos of the island as the stage for, and articulation of, manifold desires, I intend to examine here the ways in which this ideologeme is employed by a number of authors. I am interested in the poets' reformulation and transformation of the already existing topos in different poetic registers, as well as in the 'epistemic dialogue', both synchronic and diachronic, they engage in while surveying the desiring- territories of Irish literary tradition. Although I inquire in part into cross- gender dynamics in these products of both deliberate and unconscious intertextuality by reading Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill's work against certain master texts authored by men, I am neither demonstrating the remarkable qualities of her poetry at the expense of male writers, nor interpreting a rather loosely and conventionally established opposition of female/male as that of positive/negative.</page><page sequence="2">Nordic Irish Studies In Ni Dhomhnaill's 'Immram' / 'The Voyage' cycle, the island emerges as a magnetic locus for imagination. Though a site without any actual locality, it appears at diverse geographical areas that change from day to day: near the Great Blasket, in the Indian Ocean, south-west of Slea Head, in South Dakota, Nevada, Wyoming, or the docks of Galway. The poet thus creates a multidimensional space, enlarged and complicated by the back- and-forth, up-and-down contrapuntal and heterogeneous spatiotemporal scale. Thus she brings together different experiential layers: fantasy and hallucinatory visions - sometimes delusional readings of the world in paranoia - which blend into the signs of the external, 'objective' world. She mixes the demythologised and demystified mythic 'reality' of wondrous voyages with distinctly recognizable markers of contempora- neity. For example, she arranges an exhibition of a non-existent island at the Heritage Centre and sends a crew of anthropologists to explore the ghostly apparition and to arrive at a unanimous conclusion that it is radioactive.2 In addition, Ni Dhomhnaill's speaker writes a postcard home in which she complains about unreasonably priced Otherworldly merchan- dise, in a poem that provides a fabulous Isle of Speaking Birds from Maelduine's mythic wonderings with a modem counterpart - a shop window piled with stuffed birds.3 Ni Dhomhnaill's phantom landforms materialize and disappear like ancient voices calling one to embark on a quest journey to places unknown and unknowable, as in 'An Bhreasail' / 'Hy-Breasil': Cloisim tdi I hear you call ag glaoch orm out to me san oiche in the night ag rd liom teacht asking me to come go dti do oiledn to the Isle drafochta. of Enchantment.4 She further unfolds a mysterious island into the heterotopology of a nowhere land. The poet transforms the pagan Irish paradise into a fluid and luring site that unties the fixity and immobility of space by becoming even more intangible than its literary precursors - a mere sound. This mystic place of dreams, however, consistently reappeared on old maps. The legend says that a patient watcher looking to the West from the extreme west point of Ireland can catch a sight of it during sunset. Some seafarers thought they had located the island and 'called the land they found "Brazil"'.5 36</page><page sequence="3">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry Likewise, Paul Muldoon's 'Immram' and 'Immrama' draw on an old saga about Maelduine's great voyage among the Blessed Islands. But unlike Nif Dhomhnaill, in whose poetry mythic and contemporary elements are cross-pollinated, Muldoon appropriates the mythic structure and overwrites it with alternative narratives and meanings, thus superimposing modernity on Irish poetic tradition. While re-assessing the ancient space in postmodern terms, Muldoon, in 'Immrama', 'trails' his father's spirit, with geographical precision, from 'the mud-walled cabin'6 in Ireland to 'almost' Argentina. The father of Muldoon's minimalist epic, nonetheless, ends up, quite ironically but yet consistently with the legend, in Brazil, as if accidentally 'discovering' it and thus disrupting the socio-spatial order and falling in-between the cracks of myth. In 'The Disappearing Island' Seamus Heaney also utilizes the traditional discourse of marvellous voyages to the threshold of the Promised Land, a christianized version of the Blessed Isles of the West, while infusing it with a poetic form of a vision. The narrator of Heaney's arid allegory, St Brendan the Navigator, beholds the island capsize, casting everything into the sea: The island broke beneath us like a wave. The land sustaining us seemed to hold firm Only when we embraced it in extremis. All I believe that happened there was vision.7 Heaney's flight into the metaphysical is structured on the opposition and conflation of drift and solidity, with its intense relationship of land and water, reality and dream, and on an intricate interplay between metaphor and realia, in which 'a real thing' vanishes, making place for the exchange between one metaphor and another.8 The island depicted in the poem could also be Ireland, or Station Island, or the island of the self. Heaney dissolves his original landscape by descending into cultural origins below Ireland's topography so pervasive in the elaborate lore of place of his earlier work. Daniel Tobin suggests that in this poem - and this statement can be applied to other poets under consideration - 'the horizons of consciousness are no longer identified with the geographical horizons. Rather, geography itself reflects an internal state of consciousness [. . .] Things are no longer founded on their own shapes but by a surrounding emptiness that nearly makes them otherworldly'. 9 Richard Murphy's 'Sailing to an Island' represents yet another facet of iconoclastic practices in rethinking and reformulating traditional forms and 37</page><page sequence="4">Nordic Irish Studies vocabularies. Murphy historicizes geography by populating it with spectres of the past and the Cleggan islanders of the present: We point all day for our chosen island, Clare, with its crags purpled by legend: There under castles the hot O'Malley's, Daughters of Granuaile, the pirate queen Who boarded a Turk with blunderbuss, Comb read hair and assemble cattle.'1 Murphy's island is a space onto which he superimposes a set of cultural, conceptual, and spatial frameworks. His summoning of the ghost of the defiant Granuaile, an adventurous historical figure immortalized in an impressive array of legends, provides the poem with an additional discursive slant. The daughter of the great seafaring clan of the O'Malley's of Clare, Granuaile challenged imperial authority by defending Irish rights and customs and harassing Elizabethan overlords of Ireland. Having been granted, by Elizabeth herself, the charter that gave her carte blanche to sail the Western Seas,11 Granuaile transgressed the female restrictions on mobility by sailing her own fleet and became in part the successor of powerful Celtic goddesses and warrior queens. This free-floating female agent provides a nostalgic oppositional backdrop for the mundane lives of her heiresses. She is the bygone glorious past whose spirit is irreversibly severed from the present, and Murphy's is the quest voyage for the myth of 'a shrewd and brutal swordswoman'.12 In Murphy's reading of the topos, the island turns into a symbolic site of violent femininity and an arena for desire to capture its phantasms. In other rearticulations of this poetic trope, however, the desire is often structured, channelled, manipulated, and territorialized into sexuality through the translation of the landform in the ocean into a woman's body. The ritualised repetitive pattern of the imaginary morphology of specifi- cally gender-coded islands thus becomes instrumental in establishing the invariable parameters of cultural meanings, which secure the workings of certain symbolic orders within the heterosexual matrix. In this respect normative heterosexuality crafts a corporeal contour that vacillates between the materiality of the female body and the imaginary. In addition, the stratification of the 'natural' (feminine island) and 'social' (masculine navigator) based on the tired dyadic differentiation of 'sexes' and their spheres of influence reinforces the conventional scenario in which, according to Judith Butler, 'the social unilaterally acts on the natural and invests it with its parameters and its meanings'.13 However, though 38</page><page sequence="5">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry seemingly fixed and restricted by the imposed spatial and discursive boundaries, this body tends to move beyond its own limits and constraints. Thus, among specific usages of female bodies, as territories in the symbolic production of Western culture, gendering an uncharted landscape as feminine and equating woman with untrodden desiring-zones have undiminishable surplus value. While focussing on the forms of encoding of male desire in European literature, within various historical and geographi- cal frameworks, Klaus Theweleit emphasizes that as long as 'the body of woman continues to serve as a territory of desire in place of the body of the earth, which is withheld, there is no need for historical images to die away'.14 In the case of Ireland, where the collective psychological paradigm has been determined to a considerable extent by a traumatic sense of history, the land traditionally allegorized as a woman is 'laden with a history and mythology of invasion, dispossession, plantation, famine, eviction, land wars, emigration, and rural depopulation'.15 Referring to the Irish literary tradition, Declan Kiberd states that 'the age-old notion of the land as female' contributed to a conventional representation of women as arenas of contest and conquest languishingly awaiting salvation by 'a gallant national saviour'.16 Ciaran Carson's 'The Insular Celts' provides an archetypal template of Celtic sensibility that emblematises the earth's body as the body of infinite womanhood. Carson's first 'cartographers' establish their patterns of icono- graphy of the Irish landscape by constructing a sexual space superimposed on the land, which becomes a double-valanced site for acquisition, sub- ordination, and settlement. His metaphorisation of femininity, in which female body/land turns into the surface for male inscriptions, thus becomes the condition of men's cultural production: To hard hills of stone they will give The words for breast; to meadowland, The soft gutturals of rivers, Tongues of water; to firm plains, flesh, As one day we will discover Their way of living, in their death.17 The body of the feminised island traversed by relentless mapmakers, converting its curved spaces into flat charts, is allotted thus to the place both of a body outside discourse and of the site for the production and operation of power. As Elizabeth Grosz contends, '[t]he appropriation of the right to a place or space is correlative with men's seizure of the right to define and utilize a spatiality that reflects their own self-representations'.18 39</page><page sequence="6">Nordic Irish Studies Carson's colonizers of Ireland name the land into being by installing topography at a prelinguistic site, in the act of symbolic appropriation that is 'inseparable from the seizure of the land itself'.19 As opposed to Carson's almost benevolent acting upon the bodyscape, Heaney's 'Act of Union' shifts into the domain of blatant politics, where the Anglo-Irish relations are represented in terms both of a gendered landscape and of a sexual act within a gendered matrix of power relations. Here, space is conceived in terms of penetration, colonization, and domination. The connections among conquest, colonization, and rape, and the employment of a traditional Irish poetic trope of the rape of the female land, by the male aggressor, are made even more explicit in Heaney's poem 'Ocean's Love to Ireland': The ruined maid complains in Irish Ocean has scattered her dream of fleets, The Spanish prince has spilled his gold And failed her [. . .]20 This 'possessed and repossessed' body becomes an object of a double assault to exterior malefactors and benefactors. The anthropomorphic, feminized, and sexualized territory/land is either exposed to a male gaze or subjected to intrusion. In both poems, Heaney seems to accept a definition of the colonized nations as essentially feminine races, in which femininity as a racial trait is linked with subordination to the 'masculine' colonizer, an 'imperially / Male'21 speaker with his assertively active lexicon and syntax, that reflects a widely spread colonial strategy to implement the structures of external authority, basing them on the homology between sexual and political dominance. The tendency to employ generic plot and imagery in an exploration of the morphology of body/island is explicit in both Ni Dhomhnaill's 'Oileain' / 'Island' and Michael Longley's 'Galapagos'. Both poets use a corporeal island as a ready-made framework, by projecting open spaces of the female body onto a natural landscape; both invent their bodyscapes to undertake metaphoric mappings of the regions of desire; both present a map-like body view. The lexical arrangement of Ni Dhomhnaill's 'Oileain' / 'Island' fluctuates within a lexico-semantic field of fluidity. The recurrent image of water incorporates time and space and functions both as a marker of the text's coherence and as the nucleus of its structure. In this the poet draws on tradition in which water is regenerative - essential for life, fertility, and healing in the Celtic religion - and on the depth and mystery of water as the 40</page><page sequence="7">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry supreme symbol of the feminine in Irish mythology. 'Oile6n' / 'Island' begins with a panoramic view of the body in the great ocean exposed to the author's cartographic eye. The poem is structured on an antithetic principle that incorporates a single theme: the lover ('fuardin' / 'a cooling drink', 'deoch slhnaithe' / 'a healing drink') - the poetic persona ('i lir mo bheirfin' / 'when I was burning', 'sa bhfiabhras' / 'when I was feverish').22 Contrasting pairs create a rich and contradictory spectrum of sensual perceptions that run like an electric charge between two opposite poles, delineated along bipolar semantic and gender axes, providing an exchange of pleasure as inexhaustible as nature. Ni Dhomhnaill consistently exploits water imagery in her vista, fusing natural and human shapes to create a refracting aquatic surface for sunlight. Simultaneously, accumulated water imagery works to dissolve the solidities of conventional imagistic constructions. The opening lines of the three initial stanzas form the following structural pattern: Oilein is ea do chorp / Your body an island (I) Toibreacha floruisce iad t'uisi / Your forehead a springwell (II) Ta do dhi shtiil / mar locha sl6ibhe / Your eyes / are mountain lakes (III) Parallel constructions shape a 'pictorial' part of the poem, traditionally romantic in its visual mode. It is static due to its lexical composition; nouns and adjectives preponderate over verbs. Much in its poetical arsenal - trite epithets and metaphors in the manner of established clich6d images - is appropriated from male poetry. In Longley's 'Galapagos', the woman/island correlation may be considered as a double allusion in which both elements are interpreted by each other as in the surrealist game of l'une dans l'autre. This interchange- ability of woman and land is characteristic of many of Longley's exquisite amorous poems. As Peter McDonald writes, '[t]he processes involved in "nature-" and "love-" poetry are very similar in Longley, each necessitating a reverential exploration of new territory'.23 'Galapagos' adds yet another modification to an impressive volume of male poetic production, cited and analysed by Theweleit, supporting the scholar's statement that 'in all European literature (and literature influenced by it), desire, if it flows at all, flows in a certain sense through women. In some way or other, it always flows in relation to the image of woman. (It is far rarer for it to flow aimlessly[. .. ]).24</page><page sequence="8">Nordic Irish Studies Both poets' spatial definition is based on a cinematic representation of the island; but while Ni Dhomhnaill's is a panoramic shot permeated with images of fluidity, Longley's is a tracking one that narrates the body in a fragmentary fashion. 'Galapagos' also starts descriptively, but more dynamically, by introducing the verb 'scattered' in the first line. The word is loaded with energy and leads the verse straight into its subject: Now you are scattered into islands Breasts, belly, knees, the mouth of Venus, Each a Galapagos of the mind [... .]25 Longley's voyager-lover, who celebrates his intellect as he pays tribute to a body/island that is his to explore and discover in terms of masculinist epistemology, accentuates conventional symbols of female sexuality. His landscape-as-woman metaphor seductively invites one to explore geo- graphical and sexual frontiers within a particular body range - from neck to upper thighs. Such representational strategies are ironically confronted in Kathy Prendergast's Body Map Series (1983) in which she also revisits the golden age of imperial masculinity. The artist evokes the great age of British Empire engaged in redrawing the world map by providing her images with annotations in the manner of Victorian maps and diagrams. As Catherine Nash writes: The breasts are labelled as volcanic mountains, the abdomen as desert, the navel as crater. The map of this body in Enclosed Worlds in Open Spaces is flanked by cross sections of the volcanic mountains/breasts, the desert/abdomen, and a tableland above the pubic area marked as a mountain range.26 Opposing such surveying techniques in representing the female body, Ni Dhomhnaill romanticizes her personal geography, being concerned with forehead, eyes, and eyelashes. As if complying with the convention of patriarchal explications of sexuality that promote body-charting techniques restricted to genitals, Longley seems to apply mapping that is determined in advance. He observes fragmented, disunited parts of the female body: erotogenic zones, available for male penetration and knowledge. His selectively designed corporeal cartogram resembles in a way medieval portolan charts, used to map small areas for navigation purposes. Longley's representational strategy of fragmentation, however, is doubled-edged and may provoke a completely opposite interpretation, according to which disjuncture becomes an act of resistance to the conventional practices of totalising woman. Commenting on such a discursive politics, Mary Ann 42</page><page sequence="9">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry Caws, for example, points out that 'being partial prevents our been seen as homogeneous, and thus acts against the exclusion or appropriation of "all of us", all our mind and body, since we are seen only in part'.27 In this respect Longley's feminised island, or rather islandised woman, becomes a destabilizing, decentred place - a gendered heterotopos of the Other. Although magnetized by an exotic world of Galapagos, Longley's speaker remains a scientist, classifying and categorizing as part of his rationalizing project. Under his taxonomic eye, a kind of prehistoric life of instincts emerges: the tortoise, which tends to live almost eternally; the iguana, with stable, unshifting eyes; and the night-dwelling lemur. Natural, organic species inhabiting this feminized landscape emphasize its instinc- tiveness, unconsciousness, and sensuality completely divided from the mental or spiritual. All are weird, 'peculiar'; everything is in slow motion, almost immovable, unalterable; and time seems to have stood still. This wild, oscillated, insular world is invaded by a traditionally male protago- nist, a scientist, whose mind is ready to explore the/a female realm, explicitly emphasizing the binary mapping of the masculine progress- oriented civilization and the feminized natural unhistorical world. The idea of a triumphant male intellect is intensified by the reference to the Beagle, an English frigate of the nineteenth century, on which Charles Darwin carried out his naturalist research. This was done at a time when male explorers and navigators studied, described, and classified - and thus acquired control over - unknown and portentous places, frequently associated with the fecundity of both aboriginal flora and women. The poem's title too evokes the immediate association with Darwin, since his name has become inseparable from the Galapagos Islands, whose harsh contours sheltered strange creatures that appeared nowhere else. It is also worth mentioning that Darwin's expedition to the Galapagos, which remains the nineteenth century's most unsettling legacy, fundamentally changing the world's vision about life, is one of the most significant voyages in scientific exploration, providing most of the experiential evidence which fuelled his later theorizing. Darwinism, and especially The Descent of Man, was also instrumental in clearly reinstating the view that civilization was driven by masculine reason and energy, demonstrating the physical, mental, and moral superiority of male over female to support the assumptions that were deeply ingrained in the social thought of the tradition.28 Longley's scientist is very much like an inquisitive Victorian gentleman, a focal point in the evolution of the species: under the mythic sails of evolutionary theory, he embarks on an exploratory quest voyage constrained by the limits of phallogocentric cultural mappings. Furthermore, the Darwinian allusion 43</page><page sequence="10">Nordic Irish Studies provides some disturbing implications for Longley's compartmentalization of the female body. Darwin personifies nature as female in an implicitly violent manner through his imagery of wedging and wedges mutilating anthropomorphic land, which is charged with brutality and is 'shockingly sadistic'.29 The poem also resorts to generally accepted use of gender in the discourse of discovery. Both Longley's visual surveillance of island/woman - with desire as surveying instrument, that implies latent violence suggested by metaphoric dismemberment - and Heaney's discourse of the perpetrator of violence, differ from Ni Dhomhnaill's anthropomorphic island, which is not specifically gendered. Her deterritorialization of sexuality erodes an established grid and nullifies the binarism of masculine and feminine. Her island somehow becomes an island of a manly woman and of a womanly man, to paraphrase James Joyce. It is essentially androgynous, if compared to the fixed gender roles in her other poems, those addressed to a man, wherein she is very frank in emphasizing male virility. She thus ensures herself the freedom to trespass assumed gender norms, casting a seductive spell of uncertainty and warping fixed gendered subject-object relations. The ambivalence of Ni Dhomhnaill's corporeal island opens it to a disparate play of meanings. Patricia Boyle Haberstroh, for example, insists that 'Oilefin' / 'Island' 'describes a man's body', and interprets it as Ni Dhomhnaill's tribute to the 'male muse'.30 Haberstroh reads the poem in terms of gender role reversal, in which an autonomous female subject of erotic desire directs and focuses her gaze on a male object. One may also assume that the island described in the poem is Inis na mBr6 or An Fear Marbh (The Dead Man), which looks like a man in repose, and is one of the Blasket Islands situated off Ireland's South West coast. This interpretation pulls yet another string of associations. The famed islands, located at the end of the world, were beloved of generations of poets for whom they represented the powerful dream of Ireland, Gaelic and free, and were perceived to be 'a Homeric Gaelic fount of simplicity and rugged human endurance'. 31 Deborah McWilliams Consalvo's interpretation runs counter to the previous one, for she views the island as female, basing her analysis on a highly eroticised English translation by John Montague. In fact, if read intertextually within European tradition, the poem clearly contains an abundance of images traditionally associated in male poetry, as Theweleit suggests, with woman as a territory for desire: woman-in-the-water, woman as a cooling stream, woman as a fountain from which man drinks, vagina as wave, and love as a sea voyage.32 In addition, Ni Dhomhnaill's serene, almost puritanically chaste depiction is disturbed by the metaphor of 44</page><page sequence="11">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry ploughing, which is recurrent in her poetry and is correlated with the male perspective. McWilliams Consalvo also links Ni Dhomhnaill's island to the representation of 'Irish fertility'.33 In this gender context, another reading may be possible, one that would equate the island with Ireland-as-body, and thus associate the poem with a traditional symbolic representation of the country as female, which derives from the sovereign goddess figure of Irish native tradition and from its modifications in medieval literature. In seventeenth-century poetry, Ireland was allegorized as woman, as the result of the suppression of the indigenous Irish culture. Irish poets used this trope to establish a poetic convention, where an emblematised female became a sky woman, spdir bhean, and the beloved was often substituted for Ireland in love lyrics. This allegory further evolved into the eighteenth-century classical poetic genre, aisling, which evasively allowed for the expression of political dissent through the erotic coding. Moreover, in one of her interviews, Ni Dhomhnaill alludes to the female muse. While speaking of this muse's multiple appearances and shapes, she concludes: The greatest muse in Ireland is the country - Eire, again seen as a woman, and the whole sovereignty of Ireland. That's what lies deepest in our hearts here in Ireland. There has been an ongoing love affair between people and the land and the land and the people here for millennia. And we have lavished our imaginations on it until we have projected on to it the depths of our own psyches.34 Is that where Ni Dhomhnaill is coming from in 'Oileain' / 'Island'? Interestingly, in the same interview, the poet also says, 'But the muse doesn't have to be either male or female',35 as if defying any urge to antithesis, and producing the androgynous vision of the body whose gender boundaries are permeable and ambiguous. The motif of a traveller or navigator, reminiscent of numerous voyage motifs in the Irish literary tradition, is also elaborately expressed in 'Oilean' / 'Island'. But if for Longley the traveller is a scientist, even on his way to the islands of enchantment, for Ni Dhomhnaill, the poetic persona is a romantic sailor. The 'travelling' part of the poem is distinguished for its colour tonality defined by 'bin/fionn' / 'white', a symbol of purity and surrender: 'bdidin fionndruine' / 'a white bronze boat', 'na seolta boga bana / bog6ideacha' / 'the soft white / billowing sails'.36 White sails allude to a victorious journey, as in the folktale of Ctatach, Son of King Cor from Ireland, wherein white sails hoisted on his return from Greece should signal to his wife that he is alive, while black sails should signify his death.37 White sails, with a red touch of love and passion, would move the bronze 45</page><page sequence="12">Nordic Irish Studies boat of the explorer-lover, its dynamics being enhanced by a graphic, spiral movement achieved through a manipulation of the word 'cleite' / 'feather', which slips and spins from one line to the other, occupying different positions to emphasize the aural quality of words: gan barrchleite amach uirthi not a feather out of place on it nA bunchleite isteach uirthi but one feather ach aon chleite amhdin red feather with white back droimeann dearg making music ag d6anamh ceoil to my self on board [. ..]38 The speaker will navigate under the billowing sails of Irish folkloric imagery, for Ni Dhomhnaill's description of the boat reproduces the recurrent passage from the legend, 'Art, King of Leinster', almost verbatim, thus making the poem a collage of assorted images and textual blocks from the oral tradition. The passage, reduplicated three times in the legend, reads: 'He hoisted his soft bulging sails, there wasn't a top feather turning in or out in his delightful beautiful one-legged, slender, smooth vessel, from stern to stem, except one brown, white-backed, red feather on the top of the highest mast, where it made music, sport, and mischief for the hero on board'.39 Ni Dhomhnaill's subversive analytic mimicry allows her to 'quote' freely from different sources and to sail across the grids established by different cultural cartographies, constantly trying on the voices and masks of the canonical repertoires. Besides, a compressed repetition of the island image at the end, which completes the frame initiated by the opening line of the verse, brings to the surface the associations with both aisling and immram as if supplementing the mystic island of 'An Bhreasail' / 'Hy-Breasil' with body. While retextualizing male models of imagery, Ni Dhomhnaill under- takes a voyage, challenging prefabricated female identities, to accumulate and differentiate her poetic territory. Her quest narrative is opposed to Longley's traditional discourse of the explorer, characterized by the invader's need for information, who sexually charts the land; to Heaney's enactment of political and colonial suppression, and subordination in sexual terms; and to the map-making practices of Carson's Celtic discov- erers, who achieve dominion over the land by being granted the privilege of naming. In her utilizing woman-as-island metaphor, with its whole anthro- pocentric entourage, Nf Dhomhnaill operates within the framework of a 'minoritarian', peripheral tradition, whereas male poets tend to accept majoritarian codes, by adopting what Edward Said calls 'a great topoi of colonial culture',40 the quest and conquest voyages, and by assuming the authority of European observer, scientist, traveller, and explorer. 46</page><page sequence="13">Exploratory Desire in Contemporary Irish Poetry For both Ni Dhomhnaill and male authors there is the final destination of their journeys, the other's territory. The tradition of depicting Ireland as a woman and as a female body may be explained by the fact that when chaos and destruction threaten, it is natural, as Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari point out, to 'draw an inflatable, portable territory', to put the territory on one's own body and territorialize it.41 A succession of invasions and the final colonization of Ireland developed this defensive strategema in the form of a desired body. The essentialized female body, the body of the other, becomes a rationale through which male identity is defined. Opposed to this politics of representation, Ni Dhomhnaill's anthropomorphic and geomorphic configurations challenge gender-bound power dynamic. All the works under discussion are palimpsests of different mappings, allowing for a proliferation of possible interpretations created by various aspects of literary tradition and cultural history. Being shot through with the traces of a vast cultural network, they offer various points of entrance and exit into the heterogeneous intertextual field. The poets invent their islands by examining the shared territory that underlies Irish poetry. They employ inherited imagistic systems and linguistic patterns, conventional poetic genres, a wide range of associated commonplaces that have been operative for centuries, as well as myth and folklore. Their exploratory discourses, in which traditional routes have become fused with new ideologies, reorder the continuum of tradition, and recast the symbolic horizons of the island, reconfiguring its boundaries, fixities, and surfaces. While navigating the discursive territory surrounding the topos, Ni Dhomhnaill charts the liminal and pluridimentional spaces to enact the pursuit for female desire; Heaney departs from the violence of Irish history into the visionary unknown; Murphy provides a parable for his travel between two cultural formations; Muldoon creates his personal originary myth with ever confusing and propagating lineages; Carson meticulously fills in the spaces on imaginary maps; and Longley surveys the contours of woman-as-landform who/which is unspeakably other. All these poets rearticulate the meaning of the long-established trope, which to a considerable degree conditions the groping character of their texts' insights, and awaken desire in diverse forms - intellectual, geopolitical, cultural, historical, colonial, amorous, and sexual. By employing this topos, with its transmigrating themes and rhetorico-ideological conventions, they revisit the spaces already traversed and draw their own demarcation lines on existing cultural maps, thus renegotiating their borders. 47</page><page sequence="14">Nordic Irish Studies Notes and References Some material used in this article will appear in an abridged form in the selected proceedings of the IASIL 2000 conference. 1.
