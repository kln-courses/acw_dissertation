Rather than a systematic examina- tion of major European monu- ments, this program focuses instead on a dozen or so of the lesser- known prehistoric sites in France, Corsica, Sardinia, and Malta. The tour begins in Brittany at Carnac, one of the better-known sites in the tape, where rows of upright stones known as menhirs have fascinated scholars and lay- men alike for centuries. Here the theory is advanced that the align- ments of stones have astronomical significance, something the film- makers try to demonstrate by show- ing footage shot during the equinox. Next, grave chambers and stone circles on the tiny French islets of Gavrinis, on the southern coast of Brittany, and Ile Longue, just offshore, are visited. These sites have some of the most elaborately decorated stone grave chambers in all of Europe. Upright stones lead- ing to and within the graves are covered with incised lines of the sort widely known in the European Bronze Age, but not in such profu- sion as here. The scene then shifts to C apula and Cucuruzzu, impressive fortified sites on Corsica that date to about 2000 B.C. The people who built these forts probably used fire bea- cons and smoke signals to commu- nicate with each other and with other settlements or outposts. (The filmmakers demonstrate this possi- bility by building smoky fires on what remains of the fortress towers.) Other sites in Corsica are visited including Filitosa from whence come some of the earliest large stone statues in Europe. These enigmatic figures, anthropomorphic megaliths in the form of warriors with distinctive horned helmets, were set up around the tombs in the mid-second millennium B.C. In Sardinia the focus is on the nuraghi , Bronze Age tower forts found throughout the island. There is considerable discussion of the beliefs and rituals associated with death during a sequence on Sant'- Andrea Priu, "the city of death," a large necropolis in the central part of the island that has yielded many of the second-millennium B.C. bronze figurines for which the cul- ture associated with the nuraghi is famous. A large number of these are in the form of cows and bulls leading the narrator to speculate on possible links between ancient rites involving bulls and modern bull festivals on the island. The tape ends with a look at various ruins on the islands of Malta and Gozo where elaborate stone "temples" and other struc- tures dating from the late fourth to mid- third century B.C. are well pre- served. In addition to shots of the better known works at Hal Saflieni and Tarxien, the program also doc- uments structures at Hypogeum and elsewhere on the islands. Although this program lacks an integrating theme, it provides some good images of and good informa- tion on some important but neglected sites. The photography is generally good, and most of the commentary is serious and scien- tific. â–  Peter S. Allen is a professor of anthropology at Rhode Island College.
