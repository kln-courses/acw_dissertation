The order follows the sequence of the stratigraphie presentation, i.e., from later to earlier. The chapters (most written 5-8 years ago and not updated) were contributed by experts in the pottery of a particular period; hence there are some minor differences between them in approach and presentation. The chapters are accompanied by typological figures (in most cases) placed in the text, figures showing the assemblages of particular loci arranged in order of the stratigraphie description in Volume VEA and placed at the end of the chapter, figure descriptions, pottery photographs, and bibliography. In Chapter 9 we present complete vessels and sherds that were not found in well-defined assemblages or belong to loci not chosen for publication, but which are nevertheless typologically significant. The occurrence of certain sherds (e.g., imported vessels) is important in itself. In the preliminary sorting of pottery in the field (following the instructions of the expedition's director) the rims were generally retained, but in some cases only a representative sample was kept - a method that invalidates any attempt at quantitative or statistical analysis. During the processing of the finds, all of the pottery was examined and a substantial portion was kept. Part of this material was drawn over the years. In the final stage of preparing this publication, we re-examined only the "clean" assemblages of the various strata - that is, floors, sealed fills, and features of stratigraphical significance, such as pits and foundation trenches. The material treated here consists mostly of sherds. Complete vessels were rarely found, and only a few assemblages consist of complete vessels found in situ : the Str. 8 floor L606, Str. 10 floors of the Ashlar House, and the assemblage of Middle Bronze Age storage jars from LI 631 . Most of the other floor assemblages yielded only a few complete vessels together with sherds. Since the historical data suggest that few destructions occurred during the periods under discussion, this lack of complete vessels is due in our view to the repair and raising of floors. Examples of this can be seen in floors of the Terrace House (in fill LI 394) and floors of Str. 12 in Area E North. We presume that during their use these floors were kept clear of debris and that the sherds that we associated with the floors originate in fills covering them, presumably in preparation for laying the floor of the next stage above them. If we are correct, caution is required in interpreting these assemblages. While they are sealed, they reflect a prolonged period, in contrast to floors covered with numerous vessels that represent a destruction, i.e., the stratum's final stage. In addition to complete vessels found on floors, others were found in pits, two of them (LI 352, LI 901) apparently cesspits. As a rule, complete vessels from stratigraphically well-defined loci were chosen for purposes of typology. The classification into types was carried out according to the morphology of the rim and body, while the size of the vessel, the fabric, and the surface treatment (e.g., slip and burnish) were also taken into account. The scale that appears with the photographs is in centimeters. 3</page><page sequence="14">CHAPTER TWO THE POTTERY OF STRATA 8-7 (THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD) Andrea M. Berlin Though few in absolute number, the vessels presented in this report comprise a crucial contribution to the overall study of Jerusalem during the Second Temple period. This is because within Area E were two primary contexts dating to the third and first half of the second centuries BCE - periods that had heretofore not been identified "on the ground" in Jerusalem. The third century BCE is represented by part of a building that contained two disturbed floor deposits (L606 and L626) with burned but largely complete vessels (Str. 8). The first half of the second century BCE is represented by a cemetery of probably non-Jewish cist graves, possibly those of Seleucid soldiers from the Akra (Str. 7B). The graves lay immediately east of the line of the Hellenistic city wall. The cemetery was dug into the terraces that were first constructed in Str. 7B. The terrace complex continued in use during Str. 7A, when the cemetery was no longer in use. STRATUM 8 (LATE THIRD CENTURY BCE): DISTURBED FLOORS L606 AND L626 Str. 8 comprises the remains of a building that was only partially preserved because of the precipitous slope in this area. Within the building the excavators identified two rooms (L606 and L626) separated by the low stone foundations of a dividing wall. Each room had a dirt floor covered with a deep, ash-laden fill that contained a great deal of pottery, including a number of largely restorable, burned vessels (Photo 2.1). Joining fragments from these restorable vessels were found throughout the fill along with many smaller sherds. On the basis of observable stratigraphy, it was not possible to distinguish between the original floor deposit, which presumably came from the building's last phase of use, and the fill that had been dumped on top. On the basis of the state of preservation of the various fragments, however, the building's probable ceramic assemblage can be reconstituted. Figs. 2.1 and 2.2 depict vessels that are substantially complete and so were likely used in the building, while Fig. 2.3 depicts less well preserved fragments that may well be contemporary but cannot positively be identified as part of the floor deposit. The well-preserved vessels are a simple collection intended for the daily, mundane tasks of cooking, service, and storage. There are three plain ware bowls, serviceable either for food or as jar lids (Fig. 2.1:1-3). For cooking there are five vessels: three large high-necked cooking pots, one small wide-mouthed vessel that may have served for boiling water, and a broad, carinated casserole - this last the earliest attested such vessel in Jerusalem (Fig. 2.1:4-8). A deep bowl or mortar, a sizable juglet, possibly for dispensing cooking oil, and one nicely made jug with a sturdy handle and concave bottom for drawing and carrying water are useful service items (Fig. 2.1 :9-l 1). There are two lamps: a traditional pinched saucer-lamp (Fig. 2.1:12) and a locally produced version of an Attic or Greek-style wheelmade lamp, with a more easily manufactured string-cut disc base rather than the solid raised foot 5</page><page sequence="15">CHAPTER TWO Photo 2.1. Hellenistic pottery from L606, Str. 8. of the original model (Fig. 2.1.13). Two bulky jars with long necks and two large, sturdy shoulder handles as well as one very large long-necked four-handled jar provided storage for foodstuffs (Fig. 2.2:1-3). All of the plain ware vessels share a pink-buff color and the heavily lime-flecked fabric typical of most pottery found in Jerusalem and its environs; the cooking vessels also have many lime inclusions. In so small a collection, it is dangerous to ascribe much import to any assortment represented; thus I simply point out the presence of a Greek-style casserole and lamp, both common in more cosmopolitan coastal assemblages but perhaps surprising here. Dating this small collection of pottery depends first on its stratigraphie position. The building lies above Str. 9, well dated to the Persian period (see Chapter 3, this volume). In turn, above the building was the cemetery of Str. 7B , in which were two graves with associated intact pottery dating 6 to the first half of the second century BCE. On stratigraphie grounds, then, Str. 8 must date between the later fourth century BCE and the mid-second century BCE - a range of about 150 years. One coin was found in the deep disturbed fill that came down to the building's floors: a badly preserved bronze (?) whose fabric is similar to that of autonomous city issues from Asia Minor (Ariel 1990: 101, C23). Similar coins are known in Jerusalem in the second century BCE (D. T. Ariel, personal communication). The discovery of a probable second-century BCE coin in this fill is hardly surprising, considering that there were also many small ceramic fragments of the same date, and that no floor or surface separated this fill from later accumulations dumped over the city wall in this area. Dating the building's probable floor assemblage more precisely thus depends on adducing well- dated ceramic parallels (see Geva 2003: 116 for</page><page sequence="16">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 8-7 (THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD) a discussion of this problem). In general, close comparanda appear in contexts of the fifth/fourth and third centuries BCE as well as in residual debris-laden fills of the second century BCE (and sometimes later; for specific parallels, see the catalogue below). Interestingly, different sorts of vessels find their closest parallels in different periods. For example, the three well-preserved jars shown in Fig. 2.2 are most closely matched by jars found in contexts of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE: the two smaller, two-handled vessels (Fig. 2.2: 1 , 2) belong to the Persian-period "Type C" jars as categorized by Stern (1982: 104, Fig. 140), while the large four-handled jar (Fig. 2.2:3) is an example of his "Type A" (1982: 104, Fig. 139). Parallels for the cooking vessels, on the other hand, come from Hellenistic-period contexts. Thus examples matching the complete cooking pot with sack-like body, high straight neck, and flattened rim (Fig. 2.1 :4) also occur in third-century BCE levels at Dor, Tel Michal, Samaria, Ramat Rahel, and Naukratis in the Egyptian Delta, and in second-century BCE contexts in Jerusalem's Upper City and Citadel excavations. It is possible that pottery with parallels from Persian-period strata was residual here in Str. 8 and should not be considered part of the floor deposit of L606. 1 think it more likely, however, that all of the well-preserved vessels comprise a single discrete assemblage. This suggests that Jerusalem's potters retained traditional forms for some vessel types, such as storage jars, while modifying others, such as cooking pots. It is probably not a coincidence that good parallels for two of the well-preserved cooking pots (Fig. 2.1 :4, 5) appear at Naukratis and Paphos, two sites under Ptolemaic control. Local potters likely saw and adapted Egyptian style-cooking pots. In light of both the stratigraphie situation and the comparanda, the date suggested for this small collection of pottery and thus for the building's latest use is the late third century BCE. The identification of a likely primary deposit of the late third century BCE makes this humble collection unique in the archaeological record not only of the City of David excavations but of the entire city of Jerusalem (see Geva 2003: 116-1 17). While material datable to the third century BCE has been found throughout the city, none has yet been recovered from a primary context. Elsewhere in the City of David excavations, as well as in the Upper City and the Armenian Garden, pottery, coins, and other objects of this period occur, but only as residual fragments in later construction fills (Tushingham 1985: 25-32; Geva and Avigad 2000: 146, 158-159, 163-165, 174, 215-221; Geva 2003: 113-115). One consequence of this Situationen which local third-century BCE material has been found only in secondary deposits, is that the majority of identified and published pottery consists of recognizable, well-dated imports such as Attic and eastern Mediterranean black slipped and painted fine table wares along with stamped handles of Aegean wine jars (Hayes 1985: 183; Tushingham 1985: 37, 41; Ariel 1990: 19-21; Rosenthal-Heginbottom 2003: 206-208; Berlin forthcoming [Area G pottery]). Imported pottery fits comfortably with other evidence reflecting the city's culture in the third century BCE. Coins minted in Jerusalem carry images of the first two Ptolemaic kings, Ptolemy I and II, as well as their wives Berenice and Arsinoé II, a practice possible only with the favor and consent of the royal court. The Zenon papyri record that Ptolemaic official's journey from Strato's Tower to Jerusalem, where he picked up travel supplies, thus documenting both imperial contact and an easily accessed route inland from the coast (Edgar 1925: P. Cairo Zen. I 59.004). Probably the most important event of this era, if the Letter of Aristeas is to be believed, is the summoning of seventy sages of Jerusalem to Alexandria by Ptolemy II in order to produce a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible ( Aristeas 32: 70). As Lee Levine points out in his recent study, if the source is reliable, one must conclude from this episode that there were at least that many scholars in the city with sufficient knowledge of Greek (Levine 2002: 58-59). This evidence, taken together, evokes 7</page><page sequence="17">CHAPTER TWO an image of Ptolemaic Jerusalem as a city with sophisticated residents in close touch with and benefiting from Mediterranean contacts. The small collection of utilitarian vessels found in L606 and L626 does not change or add to this image. Nor does it assist in answering what is surely the most fundamental question about Ptolemaic- period Jerusalem, and the City of David in particular, which is who was actually living there? Was the city's population composed largely of priests, their servants, and perhaps a small number of Ptolemaic officials, with wealthy landholders and workers living on farms in the surrounding countryside, as some have speculated? Or did the city also accommodate independent workers, a kind of middle class between peasant farmers and the wealthy? Since it is now clear that the Upper City remained unsettled until the second half of the second century BCE (Geva 2003: 148-150), the City of David is the only locale in which evidence to answer this question might be found. If and when other primary contexts of the third century BCE are uncovered, they should be studied alongside the pottery presented here in order to answer this question. Fig. 2.1:1. Bowl. Reg.

STRATUM 7B (FIRST HALF OF SECOND CENTURY BCE): GRAVES In the level above the Str. 8 building was a cemetery with rectangular cist graves. Two graves contained intact skeletons and pottery (unguentaria and a bowl); within the fill about 0.5 m above a third (empty) grave there were five essentially complete vessels that may have been grave gifts as well. All of this pottery dates to the second century BCE; the unguentaria found securely within the graves likely date to the first half, and thus provide a terminus ante quem for the final use of the building in Str. 8, as well as a date for the burials themselves. Grave 1 (L2005) In a rectangular pit (60 x 70 cm) lay an adult skeleton. Beneath the covering layer of stones, in the northeastern corner next to the legs, were a small plain ware bowl and two identical unguentaria. Both the shape and fabric of the bowl appear local. The unguentaria, by contrast, are imports. Their form - thin walls, elongated ovoid body, no stem, and spreading disc foot - as well as their fabric are similar to examples dating to the first half of the second century BCE. Fig. 2.4:1. Bowl.

Grave 2 (L2120B) In a long, irregularly shaped rectangular pit (60-75 X 90 cm) there lay a fragmented skeleton and a complete unguentarium. The unguentarium's shape and dark gray fabric identify it as an import from the Greek world, probably Athens (Rotroff 1997: 177 Photo 2.10. Unguentarium, Reg. No. E 14688, L2005, Str. 7 (Fig. 2.4:3). and n. 40). Similar vessels found in the Athenian Agora and in the Piraeus appear in contexts dated to the first half of the second century BCE; after that time, the vessel's hollow lower body was replaced by a thin, solid stem (Thompson 1934: 472-473; Rotroff 1997: 178; Vogeikoff-Brogan 2000: 316-317, Nos. 59-62).

Four of the five well-preserved vessels - two cooking pots, one casserole, and one jug - lay close to one another above and west of Grave 1288 (these four vessels comprise LI 365; Fig. 2.4:5-8). The fifth well-preserved vessel - a cooking pot - lay at the same level as these but east of the grave, along with a sixth, less well preserved pot (these two vessels comprise LI 25 8; Fig. 2.4:9-10). The four vessels of L1365 and the better-preserved cooking pot of LI 25 8 all have parallels dated to the second century BCE. Their good preservation, date, and location suggest that they might have been grave gifts, subsequently displaced by later construction. The sixth vessel, also a cooking pot (Fig. 2.4:10), is not only more fragmentary - only half the body circumference is preserved - but it is considerably later in date than the other five vessels; it probably came from the fill that covered the terrace.

STRATUM 7A (LATE SECOND/EARLY FIRST CENTURIES BCE): TERRACE CONSTRUCTION A series of parallel terraces filled the entire length of Area E and covered the cemetery of Str. 7B . The foundation trenches and fills associated with the various terrace constructions contained a great deal of fragmentary pottery, which is typical of such deposits (Figs. 2.5-2.7). Only one substantially complete vessel was found: a cooking pot from a foundation trench at the southern end of the Area El terrace (L1734; Fig. 2.6:29). The majority of the pottery comprised fragments of locally made utilitarian vessels, primarily jars and jugs. Some of these pieces were certainly residual debris from earlier strata (e.g., Fig. 2.7:15, a cooking pot of the same type as Fig. 2.1:5, from Str. 8). Most of these pieces, however, have precise parallels from fills of the later second century BCE elsewhere in Jerusalem. Almost all of the jars, jugs, and 20</page><page sequence="30">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 8-7 (THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD) bowls shown on Figs. 2.5-2.7 can be matched by similar vessels from Area W (Str. 5 and 4) and Area X-2 (Str. 6 and 5) in the Upper City excavation, both dated to the later second and early first centuries BCE (Geva 2003: 148-150, Pis. 5.1-1.5, 5.7-5.10). While most of these fragments derive from vessel types whose manufacture began in the second half of the second century BCE, a few items are unattested before the beginning of the first century BCE. These include one unguentarium rim and neck (Fig. 2.6:22), one jug rim (Fig. 2.6:23), and the almost complete cooking pot (Fig. 2.6:29), all from foundation trenches of terrace wall W201 . These three items do not occur in fills and deposits datable to the second century BCE (see parallels listed below), and so appear to be the latest datable fragments from the fills associated with the building of the terrace wall and its associated constructions. As elsewhere in Jerusalem, then, this part of the City of David appear to have been fortified towards the end of the rule of John Hyrcanus or, more likely, during the time of Alexander Jannaeus. * Fig. 2.6:22.

These were divided into phases, although the correlation between the two sub-areas defined (Squares N/20-1 , M/20-1) is far from clear. The richest assemblage of this period was found in pit L2092, which is attributed to the middle phase of the period. The other loci that can safely be attributed to this period are tabuns (L2077, L2088), assumed floors (L2046, L2066), and fills (L2078 , L2 103 , L2 1 1 3 , LI 364) . Floors representing a late use of the Ashlar House (L2143, L2115, L1290A, L1291, L1277) were also attributed to the Persian period. The problematic nature of the stratigraphie sequence dictated the method of analysis and presentation of the pottery. The following is intended as a basic presentation of the material, based on typological considerations. Accordingly, the sherds are arranged by type rather than by context. Preliminary chronological observations are suggested at the end of the chapter. Since only indicative sherds were kept, these observations are based on the presence or absence of types that have chronological or regional significance. The Persian period is unfortunately still under- studied in terms of its material culture. The most This chapter was originally written in 1 989 . Although complete reworking was not possible, reference is made to some important recent publications and parallels from them are provided. comprehensive treatment of the pottery remains that of Stern (1982; see also Stern 2001 for a general discussion of the period). In the following discussion, a reference to Stern's typology is given for most types discussed in the text. Parallels for each type, when available, are included in the tables accompanying the pottery figures. THE CERAMIC CORPUS THE WARE The dominant material is light brownish-red clay, well levigated and rich in tiny white grits. This ware was used for bowls (Types I, II, IV, and V) and kraters (Types I and III). The material of cooking pots is different: it is dark red with a few grits and very well fired, producing an almost metallic ware. The dominant forms are household vessels, "kitchen ware" such as bowls, cooking pots, bottles, storage jars, and lamps. Conspicuous in their absence are imported luxury wares and vessels used in maritime trade such as the coastal jars. BOWLS (Figs. 3.1-3.2) Bowls are the dominant vessel in the Persian- period assemblage of the City of David and are typologically the most diverse. Most of the known types of the period are represented. Type I: Thin bowls (cups) (Fig. 3.1:1-5) These bowls are deep, with an upright wall, vertical or everted rim, and flat base. The ware is very fine, 31</page><page sequence="40">CHAPTER THREE Fig. 3.1. Pottery typology, Str. 9: bowls. No. type Reg.

The bowls are wheel- burnished on the outside and occasionally on the inside as well. Colors vary from red to yellow-gray. These bowls are included in Stern's Group A (Stern 1982: 94-95, Fig. 115) and are a variant of the "Ain-Arrub cups" of the fifth century BCE (Stern 1971: Fig. 3:4-7, PI. 3:a-e). They are attributed to the late fifth-fourth centuries (Tushingham 1985: Fig. 16:36-37; the same type appearing there in Fig. 10:34, however, is dated by Tushingham to the Iron Age, highlighting the difficulties in using the published Iron Age and Persian-period material of the Armenian Garden). Type II: Carinated bowls (Fig. 3.1:6-15) Type IIA: Deep carinated bowls with simple or sharp everted rim (Fig. 3.1:8-9) These belong to Stern's Type A5 (Stern 1982: 95, Fig. 116). They are very common in sites in the central hill country. 32 Type IIB : Carinated bowls with red slip and burnish (Fig. 3.1:6-7) Type III: Bowls with folded rim (Fig. 3.1:16- 22) These bowls have a slight carination in the middle of the body and the rim is everted and folded. Their shape continues that of Iron Age bowl types (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 86, No. 1), and they are found in and around Jerusalem throughout the Persian period. Type IV: Bowls with ledge rim (Fig. 3.2:1-16) Type IVA: Everted ledge rim (Fig. 3.2:1-12) This is the most common bowl type, belonging to Stern's Type A3 (Stern 1982: 94, Fig. 114). The bowls have a low rounded wall and flat or concave base, and are occasionally burnished inside and along the rim.

Tel Dor: Stern 1995: Fig. 2.1:9 This type is similar, in terms of shape and ware, to the previous one. The main difference is in the shape of the rim, which is flattened both inside and outside. The two bowls shown in Fig. 3.2:17-18 can be included under the definition of bowls with ledge rim, although they are unique and no exact parallels for them were found. Type V: Bowls with simple rim (Fig. 3.2: 19-27) Type VA: Inverted rim (Fig. 3.2:19-21) These bowls have a rounded profile and a sharply inverted rim. They belong to Stern's Type Al (Stern 1982: 94, Fig. 112). According to Stern, they belong to the late sixth-fourth centuries BCE. They are similar in shape to the common Hellenistic bowl. Type VB: Upright rim (Fig. 3.2:22-23) These belong to Stern's Type A2 (Stern 1982: 94, Fig. 113). Type VC: Upright wall with slight carination (Fig. 3.2:24-27) The rim of this type is somewhat thickened and the wall is upright from the carination up. Type VI: Bowls with straight wall (Fig. 3.2:28) These are thick bowls with a simple rim and a straight or slightly convex profile. 34</page><page sequence="43">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) Fig. 3.2.

Varia (Fig. 3.1:23-24) These two vessels were included under the definition of varia, as they do not fit any of the above types. No. 23 is a ridged wall bowl with an everted rim, and No. 24 might be defined as a small closed bowl, perhaps similar to the vessels comprising the twin vessels of the period (cf. Fig. 3 .7: 12) . A similar vessel was found in Eilat Mazar 's excavations in Area G of the City of David (Shalev forthcoming). LARGE BOWLS (Fig. 3.3:1-8) These are large coarse bowls that are similar in typology to the small bowls discussed above (the bowls shown there in Figs. 3.2:11 and 3.2:28 should, on the basis of their relative size, be included in the category of "large bowls"). Most of the large bowls have a thickened rim and a slightly carinated wall, and they are reminiscent of the typical Iron Age bowls. Fig. 3.3:8 is noteworthy, being pierced inside with irregular holes. This 36</page><page sequence="45">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) Fig. 3.3. Pottery typology, Str. 9: large bowls and kraters. 37</page><page sequence="46">decoration may be connected to the so-called "Cuthaean bowls," a family that is typical of the Samaria region in the seventh-sixth centuries BCE (Zertal 1989) and also appears in the vicinity of Jerusalem. KRATERS (Fig. 3.3:9-23) Type I: Neckless kraters (Fig. 3.3:13-18) These kraters have a wide globular body. Their rim is simple, thickened, or sharp. Type II: Necked kraters (Fig. 3.3:19-20) These kraters have a short neck and an everted flattened rim. They usually have handles on the transition between the sloping shoulder and the body. They belong to Stern's Type D4, considered to imitate an East Greek krater form dated to the late seventh century BCE (Stern 1982: 99, Fig. 126). These vessels are usually dated to the late sixth-late fourth centuries (Stern 2007: 212). Type III: Decorated kraters (Fig. 3.3:21-23; Photo 3.1) These kraters have a simple everted rim, short neck, sharp carination at the shoulder, and round squat body. They are sometimes burnished and the shoulder is decorated with reed and wedge impressions (Stern 1982: 133, Fig. 217). Varia (Fig. 3.3:9-12) All kraters that could not defined as one of the above types are included in this category. Photo 3.1. Krater, Reg. No. E 17022-1, L2092, Str. 9 (Fig. 3.3:22). MORTARIA (Fig. 3.4:1^1) Mortaria have a thick ring rim, smooth or ribbed sides, and a high ring base. The ware is whitish-green and contains large gray grits. The type made its first appearance towards the end of the Iron Age and is very common throughout the Persian period. It is found most frequently along the coast, from the Nile delta in the south to Phoenicia in the north (Stern 1982: 96-98). Only four sherds were found in the City of David, and the Jerusalem area seems to have been outside the main distribution area of this type. COOKING POTS (Fig. 3.4:5-14) The typical cooking pot of the Persian period is a transitional type between the late Iron Age and Hellenistic forms. It has a globular body, convex base, and tall neck. Two slightly raised handles extend from the rim to the shoulder. The ware is thin and well fired. Type I: Simple rim (Fig. 3.4:5-6; Photo 3.2) The rim of this type is simple and the inside of the vessel is slightly ribbed. It belongs to Stern's Type A (Stern 1982: 100). Type II: Everted rim (Fig. 3.4:7-9) The neck is short and narrow and the rim is simple or thickened. Photo 3.2. Cooking pot, Reg. No. E 17046-3, L2092, Str. 9 (Fig. 3.4:5). CHAPTER THREE 38</page><page sequence="47">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) Type III: Ledge rim (Fig. 3.4:10-13) The neck is short and wide and the rim is ledge- shaped. Vessels of this type are made of particularly fine ware and are well fired. The form is Stern's Type B-C and is the most common cooking pot during the Persian period, found in virtually every excavated site of this period, in the south and north of the country as well as in Phoenicia during the fifth-fourth centuries BCE (Stern 2007: 202). Cooking-pot lids (Fig. 3.4:15-18) The lids are in the shape of a bowl with a pointed or slightly rounded knob at the top. They are assigned to cooking pots because of their fabric. Krater made from cooking-pot material (Fig. 3.4:14) This vessel is unusual in the addition of a horizontal handle to its shoulder, a feature held in common with kraters of Type II (see above) that may have evolved from Greek pottery (Stern 1982: 99). BOTTLES (Fig. 3.5:1^1, 9-12) Type I: "Carrot-shaped" bottles (Fig. 3.5:1-4; Photos 3.3, 3.4) These are elongated bottles with a ring rim, short Photo 3.3. Bottle, Reg. No. E 17107, L2092, Str. 9 (Fig. 3.5:1). and narrow neck, sloping shoulder, and pointed base. They were usually horizontally burnished on the outside and sometimes knife-shaved. This form is a survival of late Iron Age Assyrian bottles and is common in sites of the hill country (Stern 1982: 125, Fig. 197). It is usually dated to the sixth-fourth centuries BCE (Stern 2007: 207). Type II: Globular bottles (Fig. 3.5:9-12) Type IIA : Elongated body (Fig. 3.5:11-12) The shoulder is well defined, the body being hand made while the neck is usually wheel made. This type is typical of Judah (Stern 1982: 127, Fig. 200). Type IIB: Biconical body (Fig. 3.5:10) The neck is tall and incised at the join with the body. The ware is thinner and finer than that of Type IIA. The rim and neck of a large bottle (Fig. 3.5:9) may belong to this sub-type. Globular bottles are very common in the south (Stern 2007: 207). JUGLETS (Fig. 3.5:5-8, 13-17) Dipper juglets (Fig. 3.5:16-17) Two sherds of dipper juglets were found, a rim and handle (Fig. 2.5: 16) and a flat base (Fig. 2.5: 17). The Photo 3.4. Bottle, Reg.

Both sub-types of dipper juglets might have evolved from Cypriot prototypes of the Plain White V-VII families (Stern 2007: 206). Globular juglets (Fig. 3.5:13-14) Sherds of channelled flaring rims probably belong to Stern's Type Bl-2 (Stern 1982: 120, Figs. 181-182). Perfume juglets (Fig. 3.5:5-8, 15) This type is represented by ring rims (Nos. 5-8) and a body sherd (No. 15). These juglets belong to Stern's Type C3-5, typical of fifth-century contexts. This is a southern juglet type, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BCE (Stern 2007: 206). 40</page><page sequence="49">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) Fig. 3.4.

AMPHORISKOI (Fig. 3.7:6; Photo 3.9) This amphoriskos has a wide shoulder and truncated base. The typical ware is light yellow, with a decoration of red lines. It belongs to Stern's Type A2 (Stern 1982: 125, Fig. 195). FLASKS (Fig. 3.7:10) The flask has a long narrow neck and ring rim. The handles are irregular. It belongs to Stern's Type B, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries (Stern 1982: 115). TWIN VESSELS (Fig. 3.7:11-13) The two connected vessels were probably deep, rounded bowls. This type of composite vessel is common mainly in the south and is dated from the mid-sixth to the early fourth century BCE (Stern 2007: 207). CHALICE (Fig. 3.7:14) This might be the lower part of the stepped foot of a chalice, a rather rare vessel in the Persian period, or an upside-down funnel (Stern 1982: 129). STAND (Fig. 3.7:15; Photo 3.10) The conical stand has a ring base. This type is a continuation of Iron Age forms and is common throughout the Persian period (Stern 1982: 130). DECORATED SHERDS (Fig. 3.7:7-9) These three sherds are different in ware and decoration from the local repertoire and are considered to be imported. Their fragmentary nature hinders any typological and chronological discussion, other than noting their existence at the City of David. THE ASSEMBLAGE: GENERAL OBSERVATIONS Many of the types found in the City of David assemblage have a clearly defined area of distribution, being confined to the central hill country and Judah. Some of them preserve Iron Age traditions and should probably be placed early in the period. All of these types are confined to sites in Judah: Jerusalem (Armenian Garden, Holyland Hotel tomb), Tell el-Ful, Tell en-Nasbeh, Gibeon, Hurvat Almit, and Gezer: Thin bowls of Type /: These are very fine and well finished. This type appears to fit into the Judean "rice bowl" class of the late Iron Age (Tushingham Photo 3.10. Stand, Reg. No. E 16828-1, L2092, Str. 9 (Fig. 3.7:15). 48</page><page sequence="57">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) 1985: 22) and may display influence of the Assyrian ceramic repertoire. Folded-rim bowls of Type III : The prototype of these bowls appeared in Jerusalem and Judah at the end of the seventh century BCE and in "transitional tombs" of the sixth century. Their technical quality seems, however, to deteriorate in the Persian period. A second group consists of types found throughout the Persian period, which should not necessarily be considered continuations of earlier forms. Carinated bowls of Type H' These make their first appearance in the Persian period in the Jerusalem area (Ramat Rahel, Tell el-Ful). Cooking pots of Type /: This form is common in all southern sites (Ramat Rahel, Tell en-Nasbeh, Lachish, and Beth-Shemesh), appearing alongside the more common ledge-rim cooking pot, found at sites all over the country. Bottles (Types I and II) and flasks: Both types are found mainly in southern sites. The City of David assemblage is very localized in regional terms. Most of the types find parallels in sites located in the hill country, especially Jerusalem and its vicinity. Absent from the assemblage are all types of coastal jars and imported amphoras such as Stern's Types H-I (Stern 1982: 107-114). However, unlike other assemblages from the Jerusalem region (e.g., Ben-Arieh 2000: 23), several forms that seem to be foreign to the assemblage in ware and form do appear. These include mortaria, amphoriskoi, which are typical of coastal sites (Tel Mevorakh, Tel Michal) and inland northern sites (Tel Qiri), and imported decorated vessels (Fig. 3.7:7-9). For a pétrographie analysis of the local and imported vessels of the Persian period, see below, Appendix (pp. 51-56). In chronological terms, the assemblage seems to fall early in the Persian period and should probably be dated to the fifth century BCE. Most of the types presented above find parallels in sites that can be dated to this period (such as the Holyland Hotel tomb and Shechem). Later types that are securely dated to the fourth century BCE are absent from the City of David corpus (see also Shalev forthcoming for a detailed chronological discussion).

They represent most of the vessel types found at the site. The results of the analysis were compared with data existing in the pétrographie database of the Laboratory of Comparative Microarchaeology of Tel Aviv University, as well as studies of Persian- period sites that are recently published (e.g., Gorzalczany 1 999 , 2004a, b , 2005 , 2006a, b , 2008) or currently in progress.* The samples were examined following standard laboratory procedures detailed elsewhere (Goren 1995, 1996a, 1996b; Whitbread 1995: 365-396) and the results compared with previous studies of defined pétrographie groups. Those groups are related to different geological environments in Israel and the Levant (e.g., Porat 1986-7, 1989a, 1989b; Goren 1992, 1995, 1996a; Goren et al. 1995; Greenberg and Porat 1996) by geological and lithological attributes that provide the basis for assessment of their provenance. This report was written as part of my MA. thesis (Gorzalczany 2004a) written under the guidance of Yuval Goren, who kindly assisted me during the present study. The thesis concerns pétrographie aspects of the Persian-period coarse ceramic industry in the Near East. The data presented here are preliminary and a final report will be released in the future. I am grateful to Alon De Groot, who allowed me to sample the pottery from the City of David. The pétrographie groups as identified at the City of David are presented in Table 3.1 . THE PETROGRAPHIC GROUPS GROUPA Sixteen vessels represent this pétrographie group. The matrix is yellowish to dark red or brown under Plane Polarized Light (PPL), calcareous and rich in iron oxides. The outstanding characteristic of this group is the temper. Sand-sized whitish dolomite crystals exhibiting a typical rhomboid shape are densely spread and very well sorted. The "immature" condition of the dolomitic sand suggests that no significant process of translocation took place and the sand developed in situ. Such a process has been previously noted in the Judean Hills (Arkin et al. 1965). The raw material can be identified as originating from clay of the upper member of the Motza formation and the dolomitic sand was obtained from the Amminadav formation. Since the sand in its natural outcrops tends to be badly sorted as compared with the temper of the pottery, it seems that the potter sieved it in order to obtain the desired homogeneous grain size. This pétrographie family is well known from different ceramic assemblages dated to several periods throughout the Judean-Samarian Hills (Glass et al. 1993: 272; Goren 1996a with further discussion and bibliography). Dolomitic sand can be found in other parts of Israel, but as far as we know its use as temper was 51</page><page sequence="60">CHAPTER THREE Table 3.1 .

Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) has confirmed that pottery of this group found in the Negev and Sinai (Beer Sheva, Kuntillet ' Ajrud) should be attributed to the Judean Hills and more specifically to the Jerusalem area (Gunneweg et al. 1985: 283). GROUP B One vessel of "Palace Ware" represents this group among the samples. The matrix is the same as that of Group A, but its main characteristic is the almost absolute lack of non-plastic components. However, the non-tempered raw material is the same calcareous Motza clay, rich in iron oxides, and nothing precludes the identification of the vessel as locally made. GROUP C One vessel, a cooking pot, represents this group in the samples from the City of David. The matrix is silty and non-carbonatic, ferruginous and characterized by dark reddish brown color under PPL. Temper includes angular crushed calcite crystals. The raw material of this vessel can be identified as terra rossa soil. This is the product of the erosion of limestone rocks exposed in mountainous regions within the Mediterranean climate zone and outcrops widely in the Judean-Samarian Hills, the Mount Carmel area, and the Galilee (Ravikovitch 1981: 58). Consequently, the vessel should be regarded as being of local manufacture. Calcite has been a popular raw material among potters as temper in cooking pots since very early times. This mineral is well suited to the task due to its expansion rate under heat, which is close to that of the typical low-fired clay (Arnold 1985: 24-26, Fig. 2.1). This property gives it thermal shock resistance, enabling it to withstand repeated cycles 52</page><page sequence="61">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) of fast heating and cooling without collapsing. Calcite, however, poses other technical challenges to the potter, since at firing temperatures of 900°C it decomposes to form calcium oxide. GROUP D One cooking pot was attributed to this group. The matrix is the same as the former, but lacks calcite as temper. Instead, the voids of vegetal matter were observed. This temper, most probably straw, was burned out during the vessel's firing process, leaving the easily discernible typical gaps and voids. Since the raw material used as plastic material ( terra rossa) is widely exposed in the Judean Hills, there is no bar to considering the cooking pot as being of local manufacture. GROUPE Four mortaria compose this group. The matrix is rather carbonatic, pale pink to yellowish under PPL. A few calcite crystals are discernible, together with silty sized heavy minerals including oxy hornblende, olivine, pyroxene, feldspar, and mica minerals. Carbonatic oolites are present both in the matrix and among the inclusions. The non-plastic components, which are coarse, include a rich variety of minerals and rock fragments: quartz, limestone, schist, and volcanic minerals such as hypersthene and olivine. Other igneous rocks and their derived minerals that appear are dolerite, peridotite, serpentine, and gabbro. The geological combination described above is absolutely alien to the Levant south of Latteqiyeh. However, it is compatible with zones where ophiolitic complexes are found. According to the plate tectonics model, ophiolites are thought to represent an oceanic crust that has been pressured against a continental plate. At the end of the process an ophiolite eventually includes a thin layer of oceanic sediments overlying basalts. Ophiolites are found in Cilicia, northwest Syria, and Cyprus (Whitechurch et al. 1984). Further west, ophiolites are common in the Aegean zone. Similar mortaria were examined in previous studies at Tell el-Hesi, where both pétrographie and NAA analysis suggested a provenance from limestone-ophiolitic outcrop environments (Bennett and Blakely 1989: 199-203). Lately, similar Persian-period mortaria from Apollonia-Arsuf (Gorzalczany 1999: 186), Yavneh Yam (Gorzalczany 2005), and Tel Ya'oz (Gorzalczany 2006a)* have been examined petrographically with similar results in all cases. This evidence seems to point towards western Cyprus or the Aegean zone as the source of these vessels, like the mortaria examined in this study. GROUP F One of the samples, a jug, showed a matrix characterized by foraminiferous calcareous clay (marl). The color of the matrix, in which silty quartz is noted, is light orange to brown under PPL. Rounded concentrations of iron oxides (limonite) are sparsely distributed as well. Temper includes sub-angular to rounded quartz grains and limestone fragments up to and occasional angular calcite and chert, as well as the calcareous coralline Amphiroa sp. Algae. The raw material in the matrix is identified as marl, which has been extensively used in the ceramic industry, especially in the Negev (Goren 1995: 302), and its distribution in the Levant is widespread. For this reason, in most cases we cannot rely on it for a definitive assessment of provenance. The pétrographie analysis of the Persian-period pottery from Tel Michal (excavated by Jonathan Rand and the author in 1996) is still in progress. However, a rather similar picture emerges from the preliminary data and a Cypriot-Aegean provenance is suggested for the mortaria sampled there. A final report will be published elsewhere. I am grateful to all my colleagues in the IAA and Tel Aviv University who kindly allowed me to sample the different assemblages: Yardenna Alexandre, Keren Covallo-Paran, Ze'ev Herzog, Israel Roll, Oren Tal, Emmanuel Eisenberg, and Moshe Fisher. 53</page><page sequence="62">CHAPTER THREE However, this is not the case for the particular combination of marl and the non-plastic assemblage described above. The coralline alga Amphiroa sp. Algae is a directing fossil, typical of the coastal beach rock dated to the Pleistocene and occurring in Israel in recent bioclastic formations (Buchbinder 1975; Almagor and Hall 1980; Sivan 1996: 48-53). Further north, similar components were observed in contemporary beach rocks and sands in the Lebanese littoral (Sanlaville 1977: 161-167; Almagor and Hall 1980; Walley 1997). The presence of this fossil in the samples of this group strongly suggests a coastal origin. On the other hand, the relatively small amount of coastal sand (coarse quartz), which is very common along the Israeli seashore but decreases sharply in quantity north of Haifa-Akko, suggests a more northern coastal source. From this area northwards, the beach sand shows a strongly dominant carbonate component. The sand becomes increasingly calcareous to the North, where carbonates form over 70% of the sand components (Nir 1989: 12-15). The description fits the situation at Rosh ha-Niqra as well as Lebanon, where the sand in the dunes near Tyre consists essentially of bioclastic carbonates and quartz constitutes only a minor component (Sanlaville 1977: 162-164). The specific combination described above points to the only geographical environment that presents in close proximity outcrops of marl, widespread sub-recent to recent calcareous marine sediments (beach rocks), and more inland-originating Senonian and Eocene limestone, chert, and chalk. This area, usually defined as the Phoenician coast, is the Lebanese and Syrian littoral area, mainly the section between Beirut and Latteqiyeh, which suits the particular composition described above (Sanlaville 1977: 15-17, 165-167). In Israel, vessels dated to the Persian period that can be attributed to this pétrographie group were retrieved lately at Apollonia- Arsuf (Gorzalczany 1999: 186) and Yavneh Yam (Gorzalczany 2005). Recently defined is another group of vessels, assembled from different excavations along the coastal plain of Israel. This group, dated to the Late Bronze Age, was manufactured from a similar raw material and its suggested source is the Phoenician littoral as well (Yannay et al. 2003). SUMMARY The overwhelming majority of the Persian- period pottery assemblage of the City of David can be attributed, on the grounds of lithological and geological affinities, to a local provenance. Cooking pots are locally made as well. However, different technologies were chosen by the potters in order to produce these vessels, due to technical constraints. Among the imported groups, the mortaria show lithological typical attributes, volcanic and ultra- basic minerals, in both matrix and temper. An ophiolitic environment is suggested as the source of the raw material and thus the provenance of the mortaria. Western Cyprus or the Aegean area would fit this description. Other mortaria have recently been examined petrographically by the author, and the emerging general picture is very similar: an ophiolitic source of raw material is suggested for vessels retrieved from coastal or inland sites in Israel. Mortaria were retrieved and examined for Apollonia- Arsuf (Gorzalczany 1999: 189), Yavneh Yam (Gorzalczany 2005), and Tel Ya'oz (Gorzalczany 2006a). At inland sites like Kh. Rogem, Metzudat Haroah, and Beer Sheva in the Negev (Gorzalczany 2004b), Nahal Tut in Wadi Milek (Gorzalczany 2006b), Khirbet Malta on the south bank of Nahal Tzippori (Gorzalczany 2008), and others, the situation seems to be the same. The second imported family is represented by a single jug, which is attributed to the Phoenician littoral. 54</page><page sequence="63">THE POTTERY OF STRATUM 9 (THE PERSIAN PERIOD) REFERENCES Almagor, G. and Hall, J.

We ascribe the end of the latest Iron Age horizon, Str. 10, to the destruction of 586 BCE. In fact, this destruction level is attested only in the Ashlar House (Area E West), while elsewhere the various assemblages represent a successive existence covering a period of 250-300 years. Since there is no direct stratigraphie continuum between the structures themselves, it is extremely difficult to allocate the assemblages to strata. The raising of floors was a result of repairs made to the structures over a long period. To determine the typological characteristics of the pottery from different stages, we initially chose only material originating on the floors of structures showing several stages. This appraisal was made for each structure separately. There is a considerable resemblance between the assemblages of Str. 12-10, and they are distinct from the earlier assemblages (Str. 15-13). Nevertheless, one can identify gradual changes that occurred over time. One well-defined group is the Str. 10 assemblages; the knowledge that has The typological scheme adopted here covers the pottery of the entire Iron Age, and thus not all types are represented in both of the chapters on the Iron Age strata (Chapters 4-5). In order to avoid repetition, the references for both Iron Age chapters are placed at the end of Chapter 5. accumulated from numerous excavations allows us to recognize them easily and to differentiate them from earlier assemblages. Str. 12 exhibits several stages represented by the raising of floor levels and we have divided it, generally speaking, into the earlier (lower) Stage 12B and the later (upper) Stage 12A. The resemblance between the Str. 12A assemblages and those of the destruction of 701 BCE (e.g., Lachish III) is striking. The Str. 1 1 assemblages thus, in our opinion, represent a transitional stage of the first half of the seventh century BCE. BOWLS The large number of bowls indicates that they originated in residential structures containing cooking and serving (as opposed to storage) vessels. In the following typological division, characteristics of morphology, size, and finish were taken into account. Many of these vessels were in use for a long period and are found in most of the strata or stages. Nevertheless, certain types may be defined as chronological markers. The four most common bowl types in the Str. 12-10 assemblages are bowls with outward- folded rim (B8), flat bowls or plates (B6), "rice bowls" (B7), and bowls with everted rim (B4). The remaining bowl types presented here occur in smaller numbers in the City of David assemblages of these strata. Blc (Fig. 4.1 : 1-2): Bowls with a rounded lower wall and base. These bowls, which occur in small numbers in Str. 12-10, continue the rounded bowl type of Str. 15-14. For parallels, see Arad Str. X 57</page><page sequence="66">CHAPTER FOUR Fig. 4.1.

They appear in different variations: red-slipped on the inside and burnished, slipped but not burnished, and burnished without slip. Such bowls occur at every stage: in Str. 12 of the City of David in Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 17:20, 18:28, 19:5,21,20:4, 17, 22: 1 , 7-8, 23:9-1 1), in Kenyon's excavations in Caves I and II (Eshel and Prag 1995: Figs. 3:8-1 1 , 19, 21, 11:41-42, 13:2-6, 8-12), and in Lachish Str. m (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5.4.14-15).

They differ from the previous type in their high technical quality, as expressed in their very thin wall, dense, thick burnish, and fine finish. Such bowls occur no earlier than Str. 10. For a parallel, see Ramat Rahel Str. Va (Y. Aharoni 1962: Fig. 25:1).

They are highly fired (metallic), leaving the surface varying in color between gray and pink. They usually have a low ring base or a flattened disc base. These bowls are called "rice bowls" or "cups ." Most of those found in Jerusalem are neither slipped nor burnished. They are divided here into three subtypes on the basis of their shape, size and surface treatment.

B8: Bowls with outward-folded rim. We include in this type rounded and carinated, large and small bowls. They are generally burnished on the interior and on the rim, and in a few instances they are red-slipped. They have a ring or disc base. Some of the larger bowls (occasionally called "kraters" in the literature) have two to four handles, a feature familiar on smaller bowls as well. While attempts have been made to subdivide this group on the basis of rim shape, in our opinion this division does not reflect chronological differences. We divided the bowls into three groups, two on the basis of size and the third on the basis of shape and finish. These groups represent the core of the bowl assemblage Photo 4.10. B7b, Reg.

Those of the Iron Age are divided into two main types: open cooking pots (designated CP), which continue a tradition deriving from the Bronze Age and early Iron Age; and rounded, closed cooking pots (designated CCP). The latter first occur in Area E in Str. 14, becoming the dominant cooking pot type in later strata. CP6 (Fig. 4.3:5; Photo 4.24): Cooking pots with a wide mouth and a rounded or slightly carinated body. The neck is not pronounced and the rim is a continuation of the wall. The rim of the vessel is molded with a ridge below the rim. This cooking pot has a thick wall and is made from clay containing Photo 4.24. CP6, Reg. No. E 6392-2, L1274, Str. 12B (Figs. 4.3:5, 4.30:6). grits. The type includes both vessels whose rim forms a direct continuation of the inverted wall and vessels in which the edge of the rim begins to rise slightly (e.g., Fig. 4.28:3). The latter represents a development of CP5 of Str. 15-14 and occurs here mainly in Str. 12B.

CCP2 (Fig. 4.3: 1 1-12; Photos 4.27-429): Closed cooking pots with a globular body and an upright neck, on which a number of ridges appear. On some of the vessels there are two grooves on the shoulder above the handles. In our opinion, these vessels may be divided into two subtypes on the basis of minor typological differences: a) Cooking pots whose neck ridges show a rounded cross-section (No. 12) made of clay containing large and medium-sized grits and occurring in the early stage (Str. 12B); and b) Cooking pots whose neck ridges are sharply cut (No. 11), occurring in Str. 12A. A distinction of this kind is possible only on the basis of physical examination of the material. For parallels to CCP2, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Area B (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 9:11) and Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 16:18, 17:13-14, 23, 18:5, 19:25-26, 21:17), Kenyon's excavations in Caves I and II (Eshel and Prag 1995: Figs. 5:4-10, 20:1-12), Lachish Str. ni (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5.6:4-9), Tel Batash Str. 68</page><page sequence="77">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 12-10 (IRON AGE IIB) Fig. 4.3.

The base is rounded or flattened. In a number of examples (e.g., No. 15), a small perforation was made in the base after firing. The jugs appear in a wide range of sizes and are mostly red-slipped, though they sometimes lack slip. They first occur in Str. 12B and continue into Str. 1 1 .

There are, however, a number of distinguishing characteristics: 1) the neck is narrow in its lower section, where it joins the shoulder, and widens out towards the top; 2) the lower part of the wall near the base is carinated, while the base is flat; 3) these jugs have a dark red slip on the outside as well as on the inside of the neck. They were found in Str. 12A and 1 1 . For parallels, see Lachish Str. IE (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5.7:3) and Str. II (Y. Aharoni 1975: Fig. 47:30), En-Gedi Str.

J6 (Fig. 4.5: 1 ; Photo 4.58): A globular jug made of material resembling that of cooking pots, and thus sometimes called a "cooking jug." Its neck is wide and straight, its rim is thickened on the interior, and it has one handle. In Area E, one vessel of this type was found in Str. 12.

Jug No. 7 is very large and has a truncated base. Apparently Assyrian in inspiration, it is made from gray clay and is highly fired (metallic). Jug No. 6 is small and its light brown clay is red-slipped: it is probably of local manufacture. Such vessels appear at the end of the Iron Age, mainly in the north of the country, and are considered imitations of the Assyrian bottle. For such finds made in the north, see the cisterns at Tell en-Nasbeh (Wampler 1947: PI. 27:447, 452), the grave at Tel 'Amai (Levy and Edelstein 1972: Fig. 18:1, 3), Tell Keisan Str. 5 (Briend and Humbert 1980: PI. 37:10), and Tell el-Far' ah North (Chambón 1984: Pl. 61:16). For parallels in the south, see Tel Batash Str. II (Mazar and Panitz 2001: Figs. 37:12, 49:8-9). Two such bottles were found at Kadesh-Barnea (Cohen and Bernick-Greenberg 2007: Pis. 11.75:19, 11.80:9). SMALL JAR Fig. 4.5:8 is a small jar with an elongated body that tapers towards its button base. Its shoulder is narrow and carinated. Two handles span from the carination to the wall. The rim is missing. For parallels, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Area B (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 8:25), Tell Beit Mirsim Str.

HOLEMOUTH JARS The holemouth jars comprise a large group within 82 the storage jar assemblage of Area E in the City of David. They have a cylindrical body (ca. 35 cm high) and first appear in Area E in Str. 14 (vessels of type Hml). Hm2: We have divided these vessels, which have a smooth rim, into two subtypes: Hm2a (Fig. 4.6: 1 ; Photo 4.62): A holemouth jar with a smooth peg-shaped rim, thickened on both the inside and the outside. This type occurs mainly in Str. 12A-12B. For parallels, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 26: 1-2, 6), Lachish Str. III (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5.20:4),RamatRahel Str. Va (Y. Aharoni 1964: Fig. 25: 1 1), and Beersheba Str. II (Y. Aharoni 1973: Pl. 58:26-28). Hm2b (Fig. 4.6:2; Photo 4.63): Aholemouth jar with a smooth folded rim, thickened and inverted. For parallels, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 26:4-5), Tel Batash Str. II (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pl. 67:9), Ramat Rahel Str. Va (Y.

Hm3 (Fig. 4.6:3; Photo 4.64): A holemouth jar with a thickened, inverted rim, on which are several prominent ridges. The sole complete vessel of this type came from a fill rather than a floor. The differences between Hm2b and Hm3 are regional rather than chronological, and the holemouth jar with a ridged rim is characteristic mainly of the Shephelah. For parallels, see En-Gedi Str.

STORAGE JARS Although only a small number of storage jars were found in Area E, the assemblage includes a few complete vessels, most belonging to SJ3. Further typological classification based solely on rim fragments was considered unfeasible. SJ2: Storage jars with a straight, not particularly high rim. These enjoyed a long existence and occur throughout the Iron Age. Only rim fragments of this type were found, divided into two subtypes: SJ2a (Fig. 4.6:5-6; Photo 4.66): Storage jars with a straight, simple rim. For parallels, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Areas B and D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 8:21 , 26: 13), Kenyon's excavations in Cave I (Eshel and Prag 1995: Fig. 27:4), Lachish Str. III (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5.18:1-2), and Arad Str. IX (Singer-Avitz 2002: Figs. 32:1-3, 34:12). SJ2b (Fig. 4.6:7-8): Storage jars with a thickened, inverted rim. For parallels, see Str. 12 of the City of David in Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 16:22, 19: 17, 28), Kenyon's excavations in Cave I (Eshel and Prag 1995: Fig. 28:5), and Lachish Str.

The rim is thickened and slightly everted. Two ribbon handles span from the shoulder carination to the wall. These vessels appear in the City of Dave from Str. 12A onward and are characteristic of the end of the Iron Age. We have divided the storage jars of this type into three subtypes: SJ3a (Fig. 4.7: 1 ; Photo 4.67): A storage jar with a cylindrical body, less swollen than the others. Its neck is low and its base is pointed. No good parallels could be found. SJ3b (Fig. 4.7:2; Photos 4.68-4.70): Storage jars with a swollen lower body and rounded base. For parallels, see the excavations south of the Temple Mount, where over 40 such vessels were found in Locus 23041 (Mazar and Mazar 1989: Pl. 4-5); see also En-Gedi Str. V (Mazar et al. 1966: Fig. 22:3), Arad Str. VII-VI (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 17:SJ17), and Tel Batash Str. II (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Figs. 45:13, 97:8). SJ3c (Fig. 4.7:3; Photo 4.71, 4.72): These storage jars, very wide in their lower portion, are bag-shaped. They differ from SJ3b in their fabric and finish, as evinced by their very thin wall.

V (Mazar et al. 1966: Fig. 22:4). S J4 (Fig. 4.7 :4): Storage jars with a pillar handle. These vessels have an upright neck and a thickened rim, slightly flattened above. Three handles span from the rim to the shoulder. Instead of a fourth handle, a pillar handle (juglet seat) is attached to the rim at the top. At the bottom, where it joins the shoulder, there is a perforation for draining the liquid back into the jar. Only fragments of this type were found.

The body is wide and tapers towards the rounded or ring base. A number of handles appear on the shoulder. The City of David yielded mainly body fragments of such vessels. We divided them into two subtypes: SJ7a (Fig. 4.8: 1-3; Photo 4.74): These storage jars have a thickened inverted rim, sometimes everted as well, in the shape of a peg (No. 1). There is sometimes a prominent ridge on the outside of the rim, producing a kind of gutter (No. 2). The handles usually spring from below the rim, but sometimes from the rim itself. The number of handles varies from vessel to vessel. No. 3 is exceptional in being relatively small and red- slipped. For parallels, see Lachish Str. IE (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 5:20:1-3, 5), En-Gedi Str.

Large pithoi have existed in all periods and survive into modern times as an essential domestic utensil. They stood permanently in one place, being apparently used as water containers. For a comprehensive discussion of such pithoi, see Kletter 1999: 350-359. LAMPS The Iron Age II oil lamps usually have a high or low disc base. Towards the end of the period, they become coarser in manufacture and the base becomes very high. All the lamps are open and have a pinched, everted rim. We divided them into several types according to the shape of their base: LI (Fig. 4.9: 1 ; Photo 4.77): Shallow lamps with rounded base.

FLASKS A few flasks, mainly rim fragments, were found. The types we have chosen to present include light- colored flasks, but fragments of flasks made from red clay were also recovered. FI1 (Fig. 4.9:5): A large, lentil-shaped flask with two double handles springing from the middle of the neck. On the neck is a prominent ridge. The wall is incised with concentric circles on both sides. Although the vessel is made from red clay, the surface is light-colored (greenish-white). For a parallel, see Arad Str. IX (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 30:8). F12 (Fig. 4.9:6): A flask with a narrow, very high neck. Two ribbon handles spring from the ridge in the middle of the neck. The flask is made of greenish- white clay and on the wall, below the handles, is a plastic decoration consisting of small clay balls (similar clay and decoration are found in jugs, the closest parallel being jug type J2). For parallels, see Kenyon's excavations in Cave I (Eshel and Prag 1995: Fig. 31:5-6), Beersheba Str. II (Y. Aharoni 1973: Pl. 63:132), Arad Str.

The concave side is totally embossed with spirals. The flask is made from light red, well-levigated clay and is possibly an import. It was found in the drainage channel of the Terrace House. No parallels to this vessel could be found. BAKING TRAYS The baking trays have a cut rim. On the upper part of the vessel are deep incisions, pierced at an angle before firing, producing a very rough surface. Some of the trays are red-slipped and burnished on the inside. They occur in various sizes. BT2 (Fig. 4.9:8-10): Trays with a diagonally cut rim. Sometimes (e.g., No. 9) the rim is grooved. Such trays have been found at practically every Iron Age site. No. 10 represents trays with a single horizontal handle on the rim. Handled trays were also found Str. 12 of the City of David in Area D (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 23:22). For complete trays with a single handle, see the excavations to the south of the Temple Mount (Mazar and Mazar 1989: Pl. 29:1-2) and Kenyon's excavations in Cave I (Eshel and Prag 1995: Fig. 17:7-8).

If they indeed attest to a cultic tradition, it was apparently a domestic cult. No. 2 is an example of a stand with windows and several ridges. Such stands were made from red clay and burnished on the outside. Only fragments of this type were recovered; other examples appear in the locus figures, as well as Fig. 9.4:6-9. No. 3 is narrow in diameter and thin- walled. It is decorated with black lines and a circle and there is an indication of a window. No exact parallels are known to us. No. 4, of which only the upper part was found, is exceptional. It is crudely made from gray clay and its slip is black or dark gray. There is evidence that it had windows. Its upper rim widens out, producing an inner gutter. We have not been able to identify parallels. No. 5 is the lower part of a red-slipped stand. It is tall and narrow, with thick wall and a flaring base. Its lower rim is thickened, and there is evidence of five windows.

DISCUSSION OF ASSEMBLAGES Since Area E is located in the middle of a steep slope and it was necessary to dig down to a solid foundation in the successive stages of construction, there are some lacunae in the stratigraphie sequence. Furthermore, erosion processes were constantly active. These two factors are responsible for the lack of correlation between the area's different sectors. Since the excavations in the City of David uncovered no destruction levels other than that of Str. 10, connections between the raising of floors in the different structures cannot be reliably established. Consequently, to offer the reader as objective a picture as possible, we decided to present the pottery assemblages from the loci of the various strata by sub-area, and in each of these by architectural unit, thus following the order of the stratigraphie discussion. As affirmed by other scholars such as Mazar, Zimhoni, and Singer-Avitz, two distinct groups may be distinguished in Judah's ceramic assemblage, the first extending from Iron Age I to the tenth century BCE (or the ninth century, according to the low chronology) and the second from the eighth century to the end of the Iron Age. The development of the pottery of the latter phase is clear today, since we possess well-defined assemblages deriving from the destructions of 701 and 586 BCE. However, 96</page><page sequence="105">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 12-10 (IRON AGE IIB) for the period predating Lachish III it is not always possible to determine the chronological relationship between the few extant assemblages published so far. In the early part of the Iron Age the ceramic culture exhibits greater regionalism, while in the later phase the pottery is more standardized, owing to technological progress. The assemblages under discussion are characterized by the extensive use of wheel burnish and the dominance of certain types, such as bowls with folded rim, which constitute a high percentage of the assemblages in every stage. Most of the ware is local and is made from clay originating in the Motza Formation. In the assemblages of Str. 12-10, one can distinguish three groups whose differences are meaningful both typologically and chronologically: Str. 12B, Str. 12Aand 11, and Str. 10. THE ASSEMBLAGES OF STRATUM 12B (Photos 4.87, 4.88) The assemblages of this stratum predate those of the late eighth century BCE (Str. 12A). The dating of the assemblages of this period is connected with the question of when wheel burnish began. O. Zimhoni has suggested that the transition from hand burnish to wheel burnish began in the lifetime of Str. III at Lachish, during the second quarter of the eighth century BCE. This corresponds to the transition to the mass production of pottery, although this was a gradual process that differed from region to region in terms of date and manifestation (Zimhoni 1997: 1 19-121 , 169-173). In our opinion, however, wheel burnish in our region gradually began in the first half of the eighth century BCE, perhaps even at the end of the ninth century BCE. The typological characteristics of the early phase are visible mainly in the bowls and cooking pots. This assemblage is also notable (in comparison with the later stages) for its abundance of red-slipped vessels. Among the common Iron Age II bowl types, we found several that appear exclusively in the early phase: B4a, B6a, and B9. This early stage is characterized by a larger number of open, carinated bowls. Although statistical data are lacking, it is evident that the number of bowls with a folded rim (B8) increases steadily in the later stages. The cooking pots characteristic of the early stage are those with a molded ridged rim: CP6, Photo 4.87. Pottery trom L1274, Str. 12B. 97</page><page sequence="106">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 4.88. Pottery from L1352, Str. 12B. typical of this stratum, together with CP7, which continues into the following stage. The closed cooking pot, CCP2, a chronological marker of the eighth century BCE, appears at this stage with rounded ridges, in contrast to the angular ridges typical of Str. 12A. One of the most characteristic storage jars of Str. 12, which does not persist into Str. 11, is the pillar handle type (SJ4). The lamps appearing in the early stage are mostly L2, while a minority belong to LI. Stands of type Stl also appear exclusively in the early stage. THE ASSEMBLAGES OF STRATA 12A AND 11 (Photos 4.89-4.91) Str. 12A is defined by assemblages that greatly Photo 4.89. Pottery from L631, Str. 12A. 98</page><page sequence="107">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 12-10 (IRON AGE IIB) Photo 4.90. Pottery from L618, Str. 12-11. resemble those of Lachish Str. III (destroyed 701 BCE). Consequently, the assemblages of Str. 11 are ascribed to the first half of the seventh century BCE. While they are very similar to the assemblages of Str. 12A, there are also variants heralding the types that mark the end of the Iron Age (Str. 10). Most of the bowls types of this stage were in evidence already in Str. 12B and only a few of them are completely new. One of these is the so- called "rice bowl" (B7b) and another is B13. Other bowls that initially appeared in the previous stratum become extremely common at this stage: this group includes bowls with a folded rim (B8), as well as B4b and B6b. Among the cooking pots is CCP2, with its angular ridges; it is characteristic of Str. 12A and does not continue into Str. 1 1 . CP7/8 and CCP3a are types that occur for the first time. The decanter (Dkl), a vessel of chronological significance for the Iron Age, initially appears in Area E in Str. 1 2A. Among the jugs , one should note Photo 4.91 .

The characteristic storage jars are SJ3b, while the typical lamps are L2 and L2-3. THE ASSEMBLAGES OF STRATUM 10 (Photos 4.92, 4.93) The assemblages of Str. 10 in the City of David can be dated historically to the destruction of 586 BCE. The pottery of the end of the Iron Age is characterized by a high degree of uniformity and a relatively small number of variants. Most of the vessels are technically proficient and exhibit a thin wall, good firing, and well-levigated clay with very few grits. The smaller vessels such as bowls and juglets, and even some of the storage jars, feature close wheel burnish that often gives the vessel a red hue (in some reports they are described as red-slipped). All of this attests, in our view, to a skilled ceramic industry whose center was located in Jerusalem, though its products also reached numerous other sites in Judah, Philistia, and the north of the country. Some scholars interpret this wide distribution as archaeological evidence of Josiah's empire (Yadin and Geva 1983). Photo 4.93. Pottery from L1281 , Str. 10. The Str. 10 assemblages include a number of characteristic types that totally replace earlier ones, a fact that has facilitated the identification of this period in other Judean sites. Some of these types begin to appear in Str. 1 1 , and even in Str. 12A. We 100</page><page sequence="109">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 12-10 (IRON AGE IIB) assigned to Str. 10 all the stages that yielded the full range of these types. Str. 10 is represented in Area E by more than one phase in the Ashlar House (the two successive floors). The fact that this ware appears both in the destruction level and in foundation trenches attests to the long lifetime of the stratum. This is also the case at other sites, e.g., Arad Str. VII-VI and the Area G fortress at Tel Masos (three stages). Vessels characteristic of Str. 10 occur in the destruction level (601 BCE) of the Philistine cities, such as Ekron, as well as in Mesad Hashavyahu, ascribed for historical reasons to the reign of Josiah or that of Pharaoh Psamtik I. In any event, these data indicate that the assemblages assigned to the end of the Iron Age (Str. 10) first appeared in the last quarter of the seventh century or at the beginning of the sixth century BCE. The ceramic centers came to an end with the destruction and the types characteristic of Str. 10 no longer appeared. Vessels that display the difference in the quality of production are the delicate bowls with a folded rim (B8c), which occur only in Str. 10, the flat bowls of type B6d, which occur alongside others, and the bowls of type B7b, which continue to appear. Cooking pots that occur only in Str. 10 are CP8 and CCP3b. They are known from all Judean sites at the end of the Iron Age. Dipper juglets of type Jtlc occur only in Str. 10. Decanters (Dkl) become very common. Jugs of type J3b appear in Str. 10, while J3a no longer occurs. Jugs of type J5 appear in the earlier stage and continue into Str. 10. The Assyrian "bottle" of type J10 is a new arrival: it is dated to the end of the Iron Age and appears only in Str. 10. The storage jars include types akin to those of Str. 1 1 : SJ3c, SJ7b, and SJ5. They are characterized by an especially thin wall, as is holemouth jar Hm4, which occurs alongside other holemouth types. The lamps of this stratum are of type L3 with a high, but coarsely made, base; they are securely dated to the end of the Iron Age. 101</page><page sequence="110">CHAPTER FOUR Fig. 4.11.

Hence, it comprises mainly household wares, such as bowls, kraters, and cooking pots, and relatively few storage jars. In general, the assemblage consists of fragments and complete vessels are rare. Although the range of ceramic types characteristic of this period uncovered in these strata is limited, it is wider than that of the "settlement period" sites, such as Giloh and Kh. ed-Dawwara, in the central hill country. We divided the types primarily by general differences of shape (round, carinated, shallow, and deep), and then by certain features (everted, inverted, or upright rim) . A secondary classification relates to the differing modes of finish: slip, burnish, or lack of either. In several cases, further criteria were taken into account, e.g., the size of the vessel or the thickness of its wall. The typological plates presented here (Figs. 5.1-5.6) include a representative sample of each type in as complete a state as possible, as well as variants reflecting differences of size and shape. The assemblages of Str. 15-14 differ clearly from those of the later Iron Age (Str. 12-10), both morphologically and technologically. The pottery The typological scheme covers the pottery of the entire Iron Age, and thus not all types are represented in both of the chapters on the Iron Age strata (Chapters 4-5). In order to avoid repetition, the references for both Iron Age chapters are placed at the end of this chapter. assemblage of Str. 13 was defined as a transitional stage between the assemblages of Str. 15-14 and the later Str. 12-10. STRATA 15-14 BOWLS The bowls are divided into two main groups on the basis of shape: rounded bowls (Bl, BIO) and carinated bowls (B2, B3, B4, B5). Among the carinated bowls, which constitute the majority, it is possible to distinguish a number of subtypes. Bl: Bowls featuring a rounded wall and simple rim, occurring in a range of sizes from small to medium (10-25 cm). We have divided these bowls into two subtypes on the basis of their finish: Bla (Fig. 5.1:1-2), bowls without slip or burnish, and Bib (Fig. 5.1:3-6), bowls with hand burnish on the inside (Nos. 3-4) or over the entire surface (Nos. 5-6). In the City of David, rounded bowls continue into Str. 13-12 (Ble). They are common in various periods, especially between the twelfth and tenth centuries BCE. Rounded bowls were also found in the corresponding strata of Area D in the City of David (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 11:1-5, 14:2, 15:1-2). Tel Batash Str. IV produced small, rounded, red-slipped bowls (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001 : Pis. 2: 1-4, 5: 11, 7: 1-2, 80: 1-3 , 8 1 :21-22, 82: 1-2). At Lachish Str. V-IV, Zimhoni includes vessels that we have defined as rounded- carinated bowls (B2) within the class of rounded bowls (Zimhoni 1997: Type B2, Fig. 3.5).

Such bowls occur in all sizes. This is the most common group in the Str. 15-14 assemblages in the City of David, but it does not appear in the subsequent stratum; the few sherds found in Str. 13-12 probably derive from Str. 15-14. We subdivided these bowls according to their mode of finish: B2a (Fig. 5.1:7-9) are bowls without slip or burnish, mostly small in diameter (14-17 cm). B2b (Fig. 5.1:10-13) are hand-burnished both inside and out and sometimes have a bar handle. This is the largest group in the bowl assemblage and its vessels appear in different sizes: large-medium (20-25 cm) and small (11-16 cm). B2c (Fig .5.1:14-16) includes a small number of red-slipped bowls, some hand-burnished and others lacking burnish. In the City of David, Area D yielded a few fragments of this type in Str. 15-14 (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 11:3, 14:1). Such bowls were also found at Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 14:1) and at other sites in the Shephelah and in the South, such as Tel Batash Str. IV, where most were red-slipped and lacked bar handles (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Type 24, Pis. 5:16, 7:8, 18:14-15, 82:5-6, 84:2) and a minority lacked slip and burnish (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pis. 9:1, 12:17). Similar bowls appear in Lachish Str. V-IV, where they are defined as Types B 14 (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.19) and B2 (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.5). Most of the bowls at Lachish are red-slipped. Similar bowls occur in Arad Str. 11 (M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 6: 1-3, 5-6) and at Beersheba, beginning in Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Pl. 21:9) and continuing through Str. VI (Brandfon 1984: PI. 26:17-19) to Str. V (Y. Aharoni 1973: Pl. 54:5). B3 (Fig. 5.1:17-18): Carinated bowls whose rim differs from that of B2 in being cut towards the interior. They initially appear in small numbers in Str. 14 and continue into Str. 13-11. Bowls of this type were found in Str. 15 in Area D of the City of David (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 13:5-6) and at Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 200</page><page sequence="209">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 15-13 (IRON AGE IIA) Fig. 5.1 .

Similar bowls characterized by a cut rim, but with a groove running underneath it on the outside, were found in Tel Batash Str. IV (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Type 32, Pl. 7:3) and in Lachish Str. VI-V, where most bowls of this type were slipped and burnished (Zimhoni 1997: Type B5, Figs. 3.8-3.9). Comparable bowls were found in Beersheba Str. IV (Y. Aharoni 1973: Pl. 55:6) and Arad Str. 12 (Singer-Avitz 2002: Figs. 1:12, 2:7) and Str. 11 (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 8:1-2). B4 (Fig. 5.1:19-20): Carinated bowls with an everted rim. A few such bowls already appear in Str. 14 and they become the dominant type in the subsequent strata. They appear both with and without slip. For similar bowls, see Arad Str. 12 (M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 1:19). B5 (Fig. 5.1:21-22): Bowls characterized by a number of grooves underneath the simple rim. Only a few such bowls were found and they differ from one another in their finish. This type first appears in Str. 14 and persists into Str. 12. Individual bowls of this group can be found in practically every site in the Shephelah and in the South: Tel Batash Str. IV (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pis. 6:6, 7:24, 82: 12-1 3), Lachish Str. V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Type B6, Fig. 3.10), and Beersheba Str. IV (Y. Aharoni 1973: Pl. 55:4-5). BIO (Fig. 5.2:1-3): Small, rounded bowls 202 with decorated bar handles. No. 1 is very small, delicate, and well burnished. No. 3 features incised decoration on the rim as part of the bar handle. Bll (Fig. 5.2:4): Afragment of a small Samarían bowl, red-slipped, decorated in black and white, and well burnished. KRATERS The kraters of Str. 15-14 were numerous in comparison to vessels of other classes. K1 (Fig. 5.2:5-8): Cooking krater, the most common krater type in these strata in Area E. It is made from clay similar to that used for cooking pots, which contains many grits. The kraters are straight-walled, wide at the bottom and narrow on top. The rim appears in a range of shapes: thickened on the inside, everted (producing a kind of shelf), peg-shaped, or with an inverted edge. Although only fragments were found, it appears that these kraters lacked handles. Slip and burnish were also lacking. In Area E such kraters were found in Str. 15-14 but do not continue into subsequent strata. In Area D as well, they were found only in Str. 15-14 (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Figs. 11:8, 15:9-10, 12-13). They are not common at other sites, e.g., Beersheba Str. VI (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 27:4-6).

For parallels, see Tel Batash Str. IV (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pis. 2:19, 3:1-11, 10:14-17) and Lachish Str. V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Type B26, Fig. 3.31). At Beersheba, similar kraters first appear in Str. VIII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 20:9), continuing into Str. VII (Fig. 27:4-5). See also Tel Esdar Str. III (Kochavi 1969: Fig. 2:12). K3 (Fig. 5.2:11-12): Similar in overall shape to K1 and K2 but with a rim that is folded on the outside, leaving a space between the rim and the walls. The vessels exhibit irregular hand burnish on the inside and on the rim, and evidently had two handles. Such vessels were found only in Str. 15-14. For parallels to No. 12, see perhaps Kh. ed- Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 14:3). K4 (Fig. 5.2:13-14): Kraters with an upright neck and simple rim. No. 14 is a krater decorated in black in the Late Bronze Age tradition. The fragments of this type lack slip or burnish. It is difficult to find convincing parallels on the basis of rims alone. COOKING POTS Cooking pots are among the best chronological markers during the Iron Age, due to the frequent morphological changes that they underwent. We have divided the cooking pots into two main groups on the basis of shape: open cooking pots (CP), which comprise the majority, and closed cooking pots (CCP), which first appear in these strata. The jugs made from cooking pot ware (see below) were apparently used similarly to the closed cooking pots. CP1 (Fig. 5 .3: 1): An open, carinated cooking pot with a wide mouth and an everted rim, triangular in section. This type, which continues the Late Bronze Age tradition, was found in Str. 15 but not in Str. 14. For parallels, see Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 16:1,3). CP2 (Fig. 5.3:2-3): Wide, open cooking pots with a wide mouth. The rim is straight or folded slightly inwards, sometimes forming a kind of inner indentation in the wall below the rim. These cooking pots were all found in loci ascribed to Str. 15 and apparently did not persist into Str. 14. A single fragment from Str. 15-14 is a variant of this type (Fig. 5 .3:4); it has a straight rim and a carinated shoulder. These vessels are very characteristic of this period in the South.

CP3 (Fig. 5.3:5-6): Holemouth cooking pots with straight wall, inconspicuous neck, and straight, slightly thickened rim. This type appears in Area E in Str. 15 and 14. Such cooking pots are unknown at other sites, though it is possible that they were classified as kraters there because of their shape. CP4 (Fig. 5.3:7-8): Cooking pots with a straight, upright rim featuring a number of ridges. They apparently appear no earlier than Str. 14. At Arad, apart from one fragment in Str. XII, all derive from Str. XI (Singer-Avitz 2002: 112, Fig. 4:1-2, 5:3). At Lachish, most of the examples were found in Str. IV (Zimhoni 1997: Type CP2, Fig. 3.38:3, 8, 12-15). See also Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 15:1-2). No. 8 is an example of a type that is transitional between CP4 and CP5. CP5 (Fig. 5.3:9-10): Cooking pots similar to CP4, with a straight, upright rim, except that on the lower part of the rim there is only one ridge. These vessels first appear in Str. 15 and develop into the very common Iron Age II cooking pots with a molded ridged rim. For parallels, see Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Figs. 16:4, 17:3). At Arad, cooking pots of this type are classified together with the group we define as CP4; see Str. 206 XI (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 6:8). At Beersheba this type first appears in Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 22:5-7) and becomes dominant in Str. VI. CCP1 (Fig. 5.3:11): A single fragment found in Str. 14 belongs to the family of closed cooking pots, which is characterized by a high, ridged neck, on the inside of which is an indentation. A further fragment was found in a later stratum. There are few parallels in other contemporaneous sites; it is possible, however, that there they were classified as jugs. See Tel Batash Str. IV (Mazar and Panitz- Cohen 2001: Fig. 83:24) and Arad Str. 11 (M. Aharoni 1981: Figs. 9:8, 10:7-8). JUGLETS AND JUGS Very few juglet fragments were recovered from these strata, and thus we present only the neck of a red-slipped juglet (Fig . 5 .4: 1 ) . This juglet is similar in shape to the black juglet with a long, narrow neck found in Str. 12-10. For parallels, see Arad Str. XE (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 3:5) and Beersheba Str. IV (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 24:6). The most common jug type among the fragments of the Str. 15-14 assemblage (Fig. 5.4:2-5) has a wide neck and a triangular, everted rim (No. 2). They are sometimes termed cooking jugs. A complete vessel of this type was found in Area B Str. 14 (De Groot and Ariel 2000:</page><page sequence="215">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 15-13 (IRON AGE IIA) Fig. 5.4. Pottery typology, Str. 15-14: juglet, jugs, holemouth jar, and storage jars. 207</page><page sequence="216">CHAPTER FIVE Fig. 15:7). For parallels, see Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 15:7) and Arad Str. XII (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 3:2) and Str. XI (Singer- Avitz 2002: Fig. 6:9-10). See also Beersheba Str. VI (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 28:9-10) and Tel Batash Str. IV Area H (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pl. 81:15). Fragments of jugs with a straight neck and a straight, simple or inward thickened rim (No. 3) occur in several variants. For parallels, see Beersheba Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 22:12, 14), Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 15:9), and Lachish Str. V (Y. Aharoni 1975: Pl. 42:3-6). No. 4 is an example of a jug with a straight rim and colored decoration. No. 5 is a small fragment of a beer jug, a vessel characteristic of Iron Age I. For parallels, see Arad XII (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 1 :5), Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 18:7), Beersheba Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 24:2), and Tel Batash Str. IV Area E (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Pl. 11:16). Body fragments of jugs decorated in black and red were also found. HOLEMOUTH JARS Hml (Fig. 5.4:6): These jars have a rounded rim, thickened on the outside. Str. 14 yielded rims that represent the first appearance of the cylindrical holemouth jar, which becomes common in the later Iron Age strata. STORAGE JARS AND PITHOI Str. 15-14 yielded mainly rim fragments. We divided the storage jars into two subtypes on the basis of rim shape; the pithoi too were divided into two subtypes. SJ1 (Fig. 5.4:7-8): Storage jars with a straight neck featuring a ridge and a rim thickened on the outside. These vessels are characteristic of the North, where they enjoyed a long term of existence. Such storage jars were found at Horbat Rosh Zayit alongside "hypo-storage jars" (Gal and Alexandre 2000: 44 48, Type SJlb). They occur only in Str. 15-14 in the City of David and in equivalent strata in other southern sites. For parallels, see Lachish Str. V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Type SJ8, Fig. 3.53), Beersheba Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 23:4) and Str. VI (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 29:3), and Tel Masos (Fritz and Kempinski 1983: PI. 140:3-5). See also Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 13:4-5, 15:10-11). SJ2 (Fig. 5.4:9): Storage jars with a straight, simple rim, not very high. These vessels vary in shape, but since most of our examples are represented solely by body fragments it is impossible to define them in greater detail. This type appears throughout the Iron Age. The vessel presented here has a carinated wall, while most of the parallels we identified are cylindrical. For parallels see Tel Batash Str. IV (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: Type 21, Figs. 5:4,19, 8:4-15, 11:6-7, 81:9-12, 83:13, 84:18-20), Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 13:10, 12), Arad Str. XII (Singer-Avitz 2002: Fig. 3:12), and Beersheba Str. VII (Brandfon 1984: Fig. 23:1). SJ6: Only rims of pithoi were found, and we consequently divided the pithoi into two subtypes according to the rim shape. SJ6a (Fig. 5.4:10-11): Pithoi with a short neck and an elongated thickened rim folded to the outside. No. 11 is exceptional in that the rim is decorated with incisions. For parallels, see Area D of the City of David, Str. 15-14 (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 13:20, 15:28), and Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 16:7-8). SJ6b (Fig. 5.4:12-13): Neckless pithoi with a rounded or thickened rim. For parallels, see Area D of the City of David, Str. 15 (De Groot and Ariel 2000: Fig. 12:6), Kh. ed-Dawwara (Finkelstein 1990: Fig. 16:10-11), and Atar Har'oa (Cohen 1970: Fig. 10:8).

We have chosen to present two examples. The decoration generally consists of concentric circles in black and red. STRATUM 13 The pottery of Str. 13 derives from only two loci: L2076 and L2123.

BOWLS One should note the appearance of flat bowls (No. 1) belonging to B6a and of bowls featuring a folded rim (Nos. 4-5) belonging to B8a and B8b. These bowls continue to exist until the end of the Iron Age. No. 2 (B9) appears in Str. 12B but no later. No. 6, with burnish on the inside and on the rim, is uncharacteristic of the City of David assemblages; it is reminiscent, but only in terms of shape, of B14. B17 (Fig. 5.6:3; Photo 5.3): A wide, shallow bowl with a straight wall, everted rim, and bar handle. It has a disc base and is red-slipped and burnished. This type is unique to Str. 13. For a similar vessel, but with a straight rim, see Area G Str. 14 (Cahill 2003: Fig. 1.13a:3). COOKING POTS Only one small cooking pot fragment was found in this stratum (Fig. 5.6:7); it belongs to CP5, which appears in Str. 15-14. JUGLET AND JUGS Among the various juglets found in this stratum, one should note the fragment of a black juglet with a small, narrow body. Its disproportionately large handle spans from the rim to the shoulder (Fig. 5.6:8). Such juglets appear, for example, in Arad, beginning in Str. X and continuing until Str. VIII Photo5.3.Bowl,Reg.No. 16758-1, L2076, Str. 13 (Figs. 5.6:3,5.21:6). (Singer-Avitz 2002: 156, JD4). A complete dipper juglet (Fig. 5.6:9; Photo 5.4) with vertical burnish makes its first appearance in the assemblages of Area E. Its rim is straight and simple and its shoulder is rounded; it differs from the dipper juglets that are characteristic of Str. 12 and 11. For parallels, see the type that is common in Arad Str. X-VII (Singer- Avitz 2002: 155, DJ1). No. 10 is a fragment of a small spouted juglet. Similar vessels were found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud (Ayalon 1995: Fig. 18:3) and in the lower fortress of Kadesh-barnea (Cohen and Bernick-Greenberg 2007: PI. 11.2:13). The jug of this stratum (Fig. 5.6:11; Photo 5.5) has a wide neck and a simple rim. We possess only the vessel's upper portion, but it possibly represents the beginning of J4, which is characteristic of Str. 12- 11. For a similar jug, see Area G, Str. 13 (Cahill 2003: Fig. 1.14a:22). STORAGE JARS The holemouth jar of this stratum (Fig. 5.6:12) differs from that of Str. 15-14, whose rim is rounded on the outside (Hml). Here, for the first time, we have a holemouth jar whose rim is folded on the Photo 5.4. Juglet, Reg.

The storage jars with a ridge on the neck belonging to SJ1 (Fig. 5.6:13) occur here, as in Str. 15-14, but do not persist into Str. 12. The storage jar with a thickened rim (Fig. 5 .6: 14; Photo 5 .6) occurs here for the first time and becomes very characteristic of Str. 12-1 1 (see SJ2b there). BAKING TRAY The baking trays in this stratum (Fig. 5.6:15) are dissimilar to the type that appeared in Str. 1 5-14 but already resemble that of Str. 12-10 (BT1 there). STAND Since we possess only small fragments of this vessel (Fig . 5 .6: 1 6) , it is impossible to ascertain its shape . The fragments are decorated in red and white and the vessel is burnished. DISCUSSION OF ASSEMBLAGES Following examination of the pottery from Area E, we arrived at a division into three chronologically significant ceramic groups. Our method began with examination of the assemblages from Area E West, where the various stages are superimposed, and from there we proceeded to the assemblages from Area E North, where the stratigraphie sequence is unclear. The ceramic distinctions in Area E West helped us to distinguish between the ceramic groups of Str. 15, 14, and 13 in Area E North and hence to elucidate the stratigraphie sequence there. STRATUM 15 The assemblage consists of pottery from stratigraphically distinct Str. 15 loci in Area E West (L1692, L1685, L2001, L1684), as well as that from two loci in Area E North (L2052,L1695). Several vessel types enabled us to define the Str. 15 assemblage as early. The dominant bowl type in the assemblage is B2, with rounded-carinated walls; B3, B4, and B5 do not appear in this assemblage. Cooking pots CP1 and CP2 appear only in Str. 15 and do not continue into Str. 14; by contrast, CP4 occurs in Str. 14 but not in Str. 15. Another characteristic of this assemblage is the almost total lack of slip. By comparing the Str. 15 cooking pots and bowls with known Judean assemblages of the tenth century Photo 5.6. Storage jar, Reg. No. 16786-4, L2076, Str. 13 (Figs. 5.6:14, 5.21:29). 213</page><page sequence="222">CHAPTER FIVE BCE (Arad Str. XII, Beersheba Str. VE, Lachish Str. V, and Tel Batash Str. IV), we have dated the Str. 15 assemblages to the tenth century. The transition between Iron Age I and Iron Age HA is based on historical considerations, while pottery analysis shows that the most prominent change in development occurs between Iron Age HA and Iron Age ÜB . Only a few excavated sites in the central hill country can be dated to Iron Age I-HA, their published material is very limited, and these assemblages have local characteristics that differ from those of the Shephelah and the coastal area. Some of the main characteristics that differentiate between Iron Age I and Iron Age HA assemblages are entirely absent or inconclusive in the hill country. Consequently, despite the temptation to do so, we refrain from drawing clear-cut conclusions about chronology. STRATUM 14 The assemblage consists of pottery from Str. 14 loci of Area E West as well as pottery from loci in Area E North (defined as Str. 15-14) that could not be ascribed with confidence to Str. 15 and is similar in principle to the Str. 14 assemblage. Most of the pottery of this stratum is very similar to that of Str. 15, and many types appear in both strata: for example, rounded-carinated bowls B2, kraters Kl, K2, and K3, cooking pots CP3 and CP5, and ridged-rim storage jars SJ1. This entire assemblage occurs in southern Judah in the tenth century BCE. Anumber of vessels, however, appear here for the first time: bowls B3, B4, and B5, which continue into later strata, cooking pot CP4, and the holemouth jar with rounded rim (Hml). It is also in this assemblage that red-slipped vessels first occur. In our opinion, this assemblage reflects a period spanning the tenth-ninth centuries BCE and corresponds to Arad Str. XI, Beersheba Str. VII-VI, Lachish Str. V-IV, and Tel Batash Str. IV. STRATUM 13 When we examined the assemblages, we were struck by the singularity of the pottery from L2076 and L2123. Further comparison between the assemblages of these loci and the Str. 12 assemblages (Chapter 4) established that the assemblage of these loci, defined as Str. 13 (Photo 5.7), represents a later stage than that of Photo 5.7. Pottery from L2076, Str. 13. 214</page><page sequence="223">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 15-13 (IRON AGE IIA) Str. 14 while to some extent approaching that of Str. 12. The main difference between the Str. 13 pottery and that of Str. 14 lies in the notable absence of rounded-carinated bowls (B2) and the introduction of both flat bowls (B6a) and bowls with a folded rim (B8). Other bowls belong to types B4b, B9, B12, and B14. One should also note the first appearance of the holemouth jar resembling Hm2 and that of storage jar SJ2b. Despite the similarity to the Str. 12 pottery, numerous types characteristic of that stratum are lacking: "rice bowls," closed and ridged cooking pots, red-slipped jugs with a squat body and high, wide neck, and decanters. Continuous wheel burnish, a hallmark of Str. 12, is also absent. We are inclined to see in the Str. 13 assemblage a transitional stage within the settlement sequence of Iron Age II in this area, which we ascribe to the ninth century BCE.

Three strata (Str. 18, 17B-A) related to city wall W285 were discerned in Area E North, while four phases (A-D) of Str. 1 8-17 were discerned in Squares M/l and M/20 in Area E West (see Vol. VII A). Figs. 7.1-7.6 represent the typological variation of the pottery with relevant parallels and Figs . 7 .7- 7.8 a selection of decorated and painted sherds. Due to the relatively small number of rims found in Str. 18-17, the ceramic assemblage is incomplete. Figs. 7.9-7.22 include a selection of pottery arranged according to loci, deriving from floor fills, pits, and foundation trenches. L1635 is the only room that yielded a complete vessel and large parts of others in situ. In addition to pottery, the Middle Bronze Age finds included decorated bone inlays, published previously by Ariel (1990: 121-124), and two scarabs, one of which was found in context with the burial of an infant (L1657) and a complete juglet. TYPOLOGY SHALLOW BOWLS (Fig. 7.1) Shallow bowls are the most common form among * The terminology for the Middle Bronze Age used in this pottery report is based on that proposed by Kenyon. The first part of the period (Albright's MB HA) is denoted MB I. Kenyon's second part, the MB H, is divided here into early MB II (Albright's MB ÜB) and late MB H (Albright's MB IIC). the open vessels. The bowls, ca. 10-35 cm in diameter, have a straight or slightly rounded wall and a large variety of rim types. Bases vary in type from flat or simple string-cut to disc and more elaborate ring bases. Most bowls lack surface treatment and only a few are partially or fully slipped with red or thick whitish texture. This thick white slip is the forerunner of the "Chocolate on White" ware typical of LB I and also appears on carinated bowls and kraters. The platters, or open bowls, were divided according to their rim into plain rim (Fig. 7.1: 1-3), tapered rim (Fig. 7.1 :4- 6), inverted rim (Fig. 7.1:7-16), everted rim (Fig. 7.1: 17-18, 20-21), and ledge rim (Fig. 7.1: 19). Very common in both Str. 18 and Str. 17 are the bowls with tapered rim and especially those with inverted rim, which appear in many variants. These two types are dominant in other sites of the hill country, such as Shechem Str. XX-XVII (Cole 1984: 41), Shiloh Str. VIII-VII (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: 86), and Hebron Str. IX-Vin (Eisenberg in preparation). The everted-rim bowl shown in Fig. 7.1 : 18 is, according to Cole (1984: 42, Fig. 2), a late MB II type that does not occur earlier at Shechem; its appearance in Str. 17B in Area E may hint at an intrusion. This may also be the case for the bowls from Str. 17A shown in Fig. 7.1:20, 21, which are rare in Middle Bronze Age assemblages (see Shiloh Str. VII: Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: Fig. 6.5:15; Jericho: Kenyon 1960: Fig. 209:2). These bowls are characteristic of LB I and usually stand on a high ring or pedestal base; like those found in the Dominus Flevit burial on the Mount of Olives, 251</page><page sequence="258">CHAPTER SEVEN Fig. 7.1.

VII: Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: Fig. 6.13:11 formed upside down on the wheel while leather- hard. The repertoire does not include the high trumpet bases, made separately and joined to the body, that are characteristic of late MB II. Most of these bowls are unslipped, although some have a red, black, or white-cream slip and burnished surface; some others were burnished on the wheel without slip. Fig. 7.2: 1-8 are closed, sharp, angular carinated bowls with an everted rim. Since there are no complete examples of the bowl type shown in Fig. 7.2:9-1 1 , it could not be determined whether they are variants of the above type or rather belong to an S-shaped closed type. Fig. 7.2:12-13 represent a carinated bowl with a straight, high neck that usually has a rounded or squat body. Fig. 7.2: 14-16 (Photo 7.1) represent a flaring carinated bowl with Photo 7.1.

Variants of this type are distinguished by the degree of angularity and the height of the wall above the carination (Cole 1984: 56-59). It is often difficult to date the carinated bowls, since they developed continuously from MB I prototypes. However, the gradual decline of surface treatment and the appearance of the type with 256</page><page sequence="263">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 18-17 (MIDDLE BRONZE AGE) flaring rim and angular shoulder place most of these carinated bowls well within the range of early to late MB E. On the other hand, the red lustrous bowl with gutter rim (Fig. 7.2: 1) is most characteristic of MB I (Amiran 1969: 94; Beck 2000: 174-175). KRATERS (Figs. 7.2:23-24, 7.3:1-5) Kraters are not common in the assemblage. The few vessels found are 25-50 cm in diameter and apparently had globular bodies. The kraters were classified into four types: Krater with everted rim (Fig. 7.2:23-24). This shape, especially with an inner gutter (Fig. 7.2:23), is the most common cooking pot form in Levels P-4-3 at Lachish (Singer-Avitz 2004: 916); however, here it is not made of the characteristic cooking pot ware. Krater with raised, thickened, and flattened rim (Fig. 7.3:1, 2). Globular krater with folded-out rim (Fig. 7.3:3, 4). Globular krater with rope-like appliqué rim (Fig. 7.3:5). This krater, with a white washed surface and decorated with a herringbone pattern beneath the rim, is a handleless southern type, known from rural sites in the Judean Hills, the Shephelah, and the northern Negev (Amiran 1969: 99, Photo 101; Oren and Yekutieli 1996: Fig. 10:6). At Jericho this krater type appears in Squares H n, III, VI, Stages X-XII, dated to late MB II (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 177:14, 182:1, 183:8, 187:10). For parallels to most of the krater types, see Shiloh Str. VIII-Vn (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: 88) and Shechem Str. XX-XVII (Cole 1984: 47-49). COOKING POTS (Fig. 7.3:6-15) Two basic forms were found in Area E: wheelmade cooking pots (Fig. 7.3:6-7), characterized by a globular body and flaring rim, and flat-bottomed, handmade cooking pots (Fig. 7.3:8-15). Both wheelmade and handmade cooking pots are distinguished from the rest of the pottery by their coarse, fire-resistant ware with many calcite inclusions. This distinction occurs in earlier periods as well and was observed at Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1932: 16). The scarcity of wheelmade in relation to handmade cooking pots is well reflected in the Area E assemblages, a phenomenon already observed at other sites of the central hill country (e.g., Kempinski 1992: 180-181). The handmade, flat-bottomed cooking pot appears in three main variants: 1) With an upright or slightly everted rim (Fig. 7.3:8-11). They are decorated with a thumb- impressed rope-like plastic band beneath the rim and have pierced holes or vestigial holes between the rim and the band. 2) With an upright wall and an undecorated band. Only one example was found (Fig. 7.3:12). 3) With a rounded or incurved wall and a plastic incised or vestigial rope-like band decoration on the rim or below it (Fig. 7.3.13-15). This type lacks holes but apparently developed from the first type, thus serving as an important chronological indicator (Cole 1984: 61-63). Such cooking pots with an incurved wall and rope-like decoration are absent from Str. 18 assemblages; they characterize late MB II levels such as Tell Beit Mirsim Str. D (Albright 1932: 24), Tel Hebron Str. IX-VIII (Eisenberg in preparation), Jericho Stage XII (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 184, 186), Bethel (Kelso 1968: 56), and Shiloh (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: 88-89). On the other hand, the appearance in Str. 17 of the first type of cooking pot with an upright rim and pierced or vestigial holes indicates either that the assemblages are mixed, or that this type coexisted with the third type in this stratum, as in Stages VII-IX at Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 163-173, 176-180). JUGLETS (Fig. 7.4:1-8) Because of the paucity of complete examples, it was difficult to distinguish piriform juglets from the cylindrical type. Most of the juglets were equipped with double handles and some juglets of both types were slipped and burnished. The piriform juglets have a simple knob base (Fig. 7.4:5-7) or a tiny 257</page><page sequence="264">CHAPTER SEVEN Fig. 7.3. Pottery typology, Str. 18-17: kraters and cooking pots. No. Type Reg.

They are similarly scarce at Shechem, Shiloh, Bethel, and Hebron, and are absent from Kenyon 's excavation in the City of David (Steiner 2001: 11- 12). Their meager representation points to a limited use of such vessels in domestic contexts, in contrast to their abundance in burials. The stump base of Fig. 7.4:9, which is red-slipped and highly burnished, is, according to Cole (1984: 69), characteristic of MB I. The pointed base of the other juglets (Fig. 7.4:10-11) is typical of MB II. 260</page><page sequence="267">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 18-17 (MIDDLE BRONZE AGE) Fig. 7.4.

JUGS (Fig. 7.4:12-25) The abundant jug fragments display a wide variety of rim shapes and some, like the red lustrous handle (Fig. 7.4:22) and the white-slipped triple handle (Fig. 7.4:23), have a high-quality finish. The small red-slipped jug with trefoil mouth (Fig. 7.4:12; Photo 7.2) is similar in proportions to the MB I jugs with flat base found in Str. XIV at Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 11:12) and in the post-palace phase (A XII) at Aphek-Antipatris (Beck 2000: Fig. 10.23:9). Its presence in Str. 18, together with some of the other types mentioned above, suggests an MB I date for this stratum. On the other hand, the jug lacking surface treatment with a wide neck, short body, and slightly convex base (Fig. 7.4:13; Photo 7.3) is common in both MB I and MB II contexts. Its Str. 17B context in Area E dates it to MB II. STORAGE JARS AND PITHOI (Figs. 7.5, 7.6) Although a quantitative study of the ceramic material was not conducted, it is clear that most of the rims retrieved from Str. 18-17 belonged to storage jars and pithoi. Further conclusions can be drawn from Kenyon's nearby excavation of Trench I, where these vessels represent 74% of the entire assemblage (Steiner 200 1:11). This high percentage Photo 7.3. Jug, Reg. No. E 16614, L2068A, Str. 17B (Figs. 7.4:13, 7.16:8). of storage jars is characteristic of domestic sites, as attested in Str. VII at Shiloh (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: 82) and especially at Jericho, when the tomb contents and the repertoire of the Tell Stages are compared. No typological differences between Str. 18 and Str. 17 could be discerned in the forms of jars and pithoi. These storage vessels appear with many rim variations, from plain and flaring to elaborately modeled. It should be noted that from the rims in Fig. 7.5:1-9, it is not certain whether all the vessels are indeed storage jars and not, in fact, jugs. Pithoi are usually distinguished from jars by their larger size (60-80 cm in height), thicker wall, and larger rim diameter, permitting easier access to their contents (Photos 7.4-7.6). Another difference is in the number of the handles: while storage jars have two loop handles attached from the shoulder to body, or rarely a single shoulder handle, the Middle Bronze Age pithoi in the vicinity of Jerusalem usually have four handles. Pithoi were meant to remain in one place for long periods, but when they needed to be moved, four handles permitted two people to lift them more easily. This is why in some cases (such as 262</page><page sequence="269">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 18-17 (MIDDLE BRONZE AGE) Photo 7.4. Pithos, Reg. No. E 10411-1, L1631, Str. 17B (Figs. 7.5:12, 7.14:1).

Parallels for most of the jar and pithos variants from relevant MB II stratified sites, rural sites, and burials are presented in the description accompanying Figs. 7.5 and 7.6. They fall well within Bonfil's Type IV (excluding Type IVc), which has a distribution in the central hill country extending from the Jordan Valley in the east to Gezer and the Shephelah in the west (Bonfil 1992: 28-29). The most complete jar (Fig. 7.5:3; Photo 7.7), found in Str. 18-17A, should perhaps be considered a post-MB intrusion because of its wider lower body, unlike the typical tapering MB II jars with small flat bases, and its loop handles are also rounder than those of typical MB II jars.

Although found in limited quantities in Area E, this type of decoration is common in the southern Levant. Ten sherds, five of which are presented here (Fig. 7.7:3-7) are decorated with a single or double-incised rope-like band. This decoration characterizes earlier assemblages of MB I at sites such as Aphek-Antipatris (Beck 2000: 112). However, it can be considered residual here, since similar jar decoration is also present in early MB II in Shechem Str. XIX (Cole 1984: PI. 38:c, d) and continues to appear during late MB II, as in Shiloh Str. VII (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1 993 : 9 1 , Fig . 6.19:4). Its usefulness as a chronological indicator is consequently limited. The combed sherds with horizontal wavy lines (Fig. 7.7:8-10) are characteristic of jars found at Shiloh (Bunimovitz and Finkelstein 1993: Fig. 6.16:4) and Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 199:6).

These burnished vessels were made of gray/black clay and have the distinctive punctured designs with the whitish fill still preserved. Tell el-Yahudiyeh juglets are common in MB I and MB II contexts and were produced locally, as attested for example by a potter's refuse pit at Afula (Zevulun 1990: 174). According to pétrographie examination (A. Weinberger-Cohen, personal communication), the vessels from Area E were made from the local Moza marl, presumably in a nearby potter's workshop. The two bowls produced in the Tell el-Yahudiyeh technique (Fig. 7.8:4, 5) are unique. No parallels were found for Fig. 7.8:4, which is a closed bowl type decorated with a horizontal punctured stripe. Fig. 7.8:5 is similar in form to the small two bowls assigned to Str. XV-XIV at Megiddo (Loud 1948: Pis. 9: 10, 14:35). The partially preserved design on this bowl is part of a scene, depicting a disc with a horned zoomorphic figure. A similar figure can be seen on a sherd from Tell en-Nasbeh (Kaplan 1980: Fig. 138c). This artistic motif is not surprising in view of the fact that the Tell el-Yahudiyeh style was often used by Middle Bronze Age potters to produce zoomorphic vessels as well as other art objects made of clay (Amiran 1969: 119; Kaplan 1980: 29-39). Levantine Painted Ware (Fig. 7.8:6-13) Levantine Painted Ware is represented by 19 sherds, all from Str. 17B except for Fig. 7.8:11 from Str. 18. This ware appears mostly in the form of juglets and jugs. It is characterized by reddish brown decoration applied on a cream slip or directly on the surface of the vessel, which is sometimes burnished. The decoration consists of vertical strokes around the base of the neck and horizontal bands of varying width and a concentric circle on the body. The ware, best exemplified here by Fig. 7.8:7, is found at such sites as Aphek- Antipatris (Beck 2000: 209-2 11), Ginosar (Epstein 1974: Fig. 14:3, 4), and Sidon (Doument-Serhal 2004: 143, Fig. 93, Phase 1). The cross-hatched band (Fig. 7.8:12, 13) is known from a krater from Tel Dan (Ilan 1996b: Fig. 7:5). Open vessels decorated in the same technique can apparently be related to the Levantine Painted Ware as well, although Bagh (2000: 31-41, 52) excludes such vessels from her typology. This is exemplified by a carinated bowl (Fig. 7.2:13) with horizontal bands painted on a cream burnished slip. Similarly decorated bowls are known from burials at Ginosar Fig. 7.7.

Levantine Painted Ware is indigenous to the southern Levant and is dated primarily to MB I (Tubb 1983: 52-54). There is, however, evidence of continuation into MB II (Gerstenblith 1983: 70), as also observed for the painted stepped-rim juglets in mortuary contexts of Str. XI-X at Tel Dan (Ilan 1996a: 229, Fig. 4.83; 1996b: 168). Although in Area E most of this pottery was found in Str. 17B, it was apparently still in use in Str. 18. It is also noteworthy that Levantine Painted Ware has not so far been recorded in any other site of the Judean hill country. Red, White, and Blue Ware (Fig. 7.8:14, 15) Two body sherds and a neck fragment found in Str. 18 have reddish brown and bluish gray bands painted on a white slip. This ware belongs to a distinctive decorative style classified by Maeir (2002: 229) as Red, White, and Blue Ware. In terms of geographical location, the closest parallels derive from Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 185:11) and Tell Beit Mirsim Str. G-F (Albright 1933: 70, PI. 22:5, 8-10). According to Maeir (1997: 128), the Red, White, and Blue Ware is primarily a southern and coastal group, absent from Middle Bronze Age assemblages in Galilee, and dates from mid to late MB II, prior to the terminal stage. However, judging from the finds from Tell Beit Mirsim and the City of David, this ware already appeared in MB I. Cypriot White Painted IV Ware (Fig. 7.8:16) Fig. 7.8:16 is part of a handle decorated with dark brown bands flanking diagonal lines. This is the only imported Cypriot ware identified in the assemblage and is in typical White Painted IV Ware style, dating from the Middle Cypriot II period (see Äström 1957: Figs. XII: 10-12, XIII:9, XV: 10). Similar handles can be seen on White Painted IV Cypriot jars of the Pendant Line Style in Tomb 4 at Ginosar (Epstein 1974: Fig. 15:9) and in Tomb LXXXV at Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949: Fig. 108: 19, 20).

Pottery typology, Str. 18-17: decorated sherds. 271</page><page sequence="278">CHAPTER SEVEN Bethany (Loffreda 1974: 165, Fig. 8:13) indicates that imported Cypriot wares were in demand in the Jerusalem vicinity, although during the Middle Bronze Age they were still scarce in inland regions in contrast to their representation in coastal sites (Gerstenblith 1983: 70-71). The handle from Area E can be assigned to MB I or MB II, since the Pendent Line Style was imported into Canaan until the end of the Middle Bronze Age (Johnson 1982: 64). Other painted pottery (Fig. 7.8:17, 18 ) Two sherds (Figs. 7.7:4, 5), perhaps shoulder fragments, display a horizontal band of triangles painted on a white slip. These sherds resemble the decoration on a "Chocolate on White" style krater from Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 170:1), a style that makes its first appearance at the end of MB II and becomes one of the pottery hallmarks of the following LB I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ceramic repertoire of Str. 18-17 can be dated firmly within the Middle Bronze Age. The pottery of Str. 18 is characterized mainly by plain vessels of which only the flat-bottomed cooking pots with pierced holes beneath the rim have some chronological value, pointing to an earlier date within the Middle Bronze Age. This date is further supported by finds such as the stepped-rim juglet (Fig. 7.4: 12), the red-slipped jug (Fig. 7.4: 12), the highly polished ware (e.g., Fig. 7.2:1, 7:4:9), and especially the imported Levantine Painted Ware (Fig. 7.8:6-13). However, the lack of typical early MB I forms in this assemblage and the scarcity of slipped ware suggest a date in late MB I or even early MB II. Prag (1991) was the first to ascribe to MB I a group of vessels found in a nearby burial cave published in 1926 by Macalister and Duncan. Although the ceramic assemblage discovered is related to the occupation of the first fortified city, the nature of MB I settlement outside Jerusalem remains elusive, since residential sites of this period in the Judean Hills have not been uncovered. This lack of evidence has prompted researchers to reconstruct a setting of sparse settlements (Maeir 2000: 49) or camps used by semi-nomadic pastoralists (Gonen 2001: 121) for this period. It is commonly believed that the Middle Bronze Age inhabitants of the Judean Hills originated in the coastal plain and moved up into the unpopulated areas, such as the Jerusalem region, during late MB I (Dever 1987: 152). Contemporary ceramic assemblages were recently published from Kenyon 's excavations on the eastern slope of the City of David. The finds derived from Trench I behind the city wall (Wall 3) were related to the early phase of the fortified city (Steiner 2001: 10-20). This assemblage is chronologically comparable to Str. 1 8 of Area E, specifically the pottery found adjacent to W285, the continuation of the same city wall (Wall 3) to the south. In her assessment, Steiner correctly suggested that the pottery dates from the end of MB I and the transition to MB II, ca. 1800 BCE, asserting that the "town was probably short-lived and ceased to exist in the 17th century BC" (Steiner 2001: 22). The ceramic repertoire associated with Str. 17B is paralleled in an assemblage from Kenyon 's excavation in Cave IV, dated slightly later in MB II. The pottery presented in Str. 17B is also chronologically comparable to the unpublished small assemblage from the fills of the monumental towers (Area C), uncovered by Reich and Shukrun (1997 and personal communication) at the Gihon Spring. The pottery types represented in the assemblages of Str. 1 8-17 seem to reflect a broader chronological range than that suggested by Steiner, perhaps throughout MB II. Although diagnostic late MB II pottery, such as trumpet-base vessels and eggshell wares, was not found, certain vessel types, especially the flat-bottomed cooking pots with incurved walls and the vestigial rope-like plastic bands, suggest a late MB II date for Str. 17A, as 272</page><page sequence="279">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 18-17 (MIDDLE BRONZE AGE) proposed by Bunimovitz and Finkelstein (1993: 95) at Shiloh. This is further supported by the late MB II scarab seal impressions found on pottery fragments (see Chapter 13). Whether Str. 17 A represents the final Middle Bronze Age occupation at the City of David remains an open question, as construction activities in Iron Age II destroyed all earlier layers down to this level. Meanwhile, the abundant finds in the nearby Dominus Flevit Tomb (Sailer 1964) provide archaeological evidence for continuation of settlement in Jerusalem into the Late Bronze Age.

Str. 18, Area E North. 301</page><page sequence="308">CHAPTER EIGHT THE POTTERY OF STRATA 21-19 (THE EARLIEST PERIODS AND EARLY BRONZE AGE) Raphael Greenberg The Early Bronze Age Str. 20-19 represent the earliest architectural phases in the City of David. However, ceramic material from fills underlying the floors of these strata, and especially from cavities and fissures in the bedrock, revealed evidence of an earlier presence at the site ("Str. 21"), beginning in the fifth millennium BCE and ending in the second half of the fourth millennium. The material associated with the architectural remains in Area E - all of it fragmentary and apparently representing primary and secondary refuse - may be dated to the third millennium, thus leaving a gap that appears to span at least the latter part of EB I (although material attributed to this phase has been identified elsewhere in the vicinity of the City of David; see Maeir 2000: 35-38). The following discussion begins with a presentation of the earliest pottery in Area E, all of it recovered from mixed contexts. It is followed by a typological presentation of the Early Bronze Age pottery associated with the architecture of Str. 20-19. In view of the nature of the contexts, no quantification is attempted. FIFTH-FOURTH MILLENNIUM POTTERY Using intuitive criteria based on form, fabric, "feel," and decoration, the earliest pottery from the City of David has been placed in three groups: possibly pre- Ghassulian Chalcolithic, Ghassulian/Beer Sheva, and post-Ghassulian. PRE-GHASSULIAN (?) POTTERY (Fig. 8.1:1-8) The identification of Chalcolithic material predating the Ghassulian/Beer Sheva horizon at the City of David is, at best, tentative. The items enumerated below, all from mixed contexts, differ in techniques and fabrics from the diagnostic Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age pottery. Fig. 8.1:1, with a reddish-brown to brown slip and high burnish, appears to belong to the type of deep, carinated, burnished bowl found in Wadi Rabah/Bet Shean XVIII assemblages of the early fifth millennium BCE (Garfinkel 1999: Figs. 67, 95-96); a similar date may be assigned to the bow-rim jar fragment in Fig. 8.1:3 (ibid.: Figs. 84, 109), the holemouth beaker or small jar in Fig. 8.1:2 (ibid.: Fig. 104:4), and the sherd with nail- impressed decoration in Fig. 8.1:4 (ibid.: Photo 78). The coarse, poorly fired krater rim (Fig. 8.1:5), fenestrated chalice fragment (Fig. 8.1:6), knob handle (Fig. 8.1:7), and jar base (Fig. 8.1:8) all find parallels in pre-Ghassulian assemblages as well (Garfinkel 1999: Figs. 80:4, 101, 112:8), though they could represent a local Ghassulian industry. CHALCOLITHIC GHASSULIAN/BEER SHEVA POTTERY (Fig. 8.1:9-28) Open forms typical of the Chalcolithic of southern Israel include a variety of small and medium-sized wheel-turned ("V-shaped") bowls (Fig. 8.1:9-14), most decorated with a thin red stripe along the rim (Garfinkel 1999: Figs. 127:1-8, 129:11-13), a cornet rim and cornet bases (Fig. 8.1:15-17; 303</page><page sequence="309">CHAPTER EIGHT Photo 8.1 . Chalcolithic pottery, Str. 21 . Garfinkel 1999: Fig. 133:11, 12), and bases of a goblet (Fig. 8.1:18; Garfinkel 1999: Fig. 133:19-21) and fenestrated chalice (Fig. 8.1:19; cf. Ussishkin 1980: Fig. 7:7). The larger forms are made of a noticeably coarse fabric, resembling that of the material attributed to the pre-Ghassulian phase. Fig. 8.1:20 is a krater rim with pie-crust decoration (Garfinkel 1999: Fig. 138). Fig. 8.1:21 is a body fragment and Fig. 8.1 :22-23 lug handles, belonging to red-decorated jars. Fig. 8.1:24 is a triangular-sectioned pithos handle, Fig. 8.1:25 is a double lug handle attached to what appears to have been the pointed end of a chimi, and Fig. 8.1:26 is a fragment of a base with a basketry impression. A few decorated fragments are attributed to this chronological horizon as well. They include a sherd with applied plastic rope decoration, possibly representing gazelle horns, that may have been part of a ceramic ossuary (Fig. 8.1:27) and a painted fragment (Fig. 8.1:28) that may have belonged to a decorated goblet or jar. POST-GHASSULIAN POTTERY (Fig. 8.2) This catchall term describes a number of sherds from various contexts that seem to fall between 304 the Chalcolithic on the one hand, and the main bulk of the Str. 20-19 pottery, dated to EB Il-in, on the other. They include a red-slipped, straight- walled bowl (Fig. 8.2:1), a hemispherical bowl with a brown stripe along the rim and soot-marks indicating use as a lamp (Fig. 8.2:2), two holemouth rims with pie-crust decoration (Fig. 8.2:3, 4), and red-slipped double-handles (Fig. 8.2:5-7). Along with the fine-painted sherds (Fig. 8.2:8-10), the forms are comparable to material from early to mid EB I, such as that from Moza (Eisenberg 1993) and Hartuv (Mazar and Miroschedji 1996: 25-29). While some of these forms could be dated to late EB I, it should be stressed that there is, in this area of the City of David, no firm evidence for a late EB I presence. THIRD-MILLENNIUM POTTERY Figs. 8.3-8.10 represent pottery deriving from the stratigraphically most secure loci of Str. 20-19 in Area E. The numerous additional Early Bronze Age sherds found in mixed fills are illustrated only insofar as they provide examples of types not encountered in the selected loci. HEMISPHERICAL BOWLS This category includes deep hemispherical bowls with full red slip and burnish (Figs. 8.5:1, 21; 8.6:1; 8.8:1; 8.9:1), partially red-slipped bowls with pattern burnish (Fig. 8.8:11, 12), a painted bowl (Fig. 8.3:1), bowls with a thin red slip, not burnished (Figs. 8.4:1; 8.6:2; 8.7:15), and unslipped bowls (Figs. 8.8:2; 8.10:6, 7), including a thickset lamp (Fig. 8.6:3). Hemispherical bowls are ubiquitous in the Early Bronze Age. Within this group, bowls with red slip both inside and out, often used as lamps, are more typical of EB II (e.g., Amiran 1978: PI. 22), whereas bowls with partial red slip and a pattern burnish are characteristic of EB III (Miroschedji 2000: 320-322; cf. Callaway 1972: Fig. 59:1, 4; Greenberg 1996: Fig. 3.33:2). Absent are wheelmade hemispherical bowls of late EB III.</page><page sequence="310">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 21-19 (THE EARLIEST PERIODS AND EARLY BRONZE AGE) Photo 8.2. Pottery from EB house, Str. 20-19. Bowls like the fragment decorated with painted bands inside and out occur in early EB III (Harrison 2000: Fig. 19.2:4; Miroschedji 2000: Fig. 18.3:3, 4). CARINATED BOWLS Lamp-bowls (Fig. 8.8:3, 13) and thinner-walled bowls (Figs. 8.5:2; 8.10:3) represent variations on the slightly carinated bowl of EB II (e.g., Callaway 1972: Fig. 44:5-9; 1980: Fig. 68:5, 12, 16; Miroschedji 1988: PI. 21:4-6). The typical high carination of EB III does not occur in this assemblage. CLOSED BOWLS Figs. 8.3:2, 8.6:4, and 8.7:2 are heavy bowls with incurved rim, perhaps originally spouted (cf. Callaway 1980: Fig. 114:16,21; see below, Vats and Basins). Figs. 8.3:3 and 8.9:2, red-slipped inside and out, appear to belong to mugs of a type found in both EB II and EB in (Amiran 1978: PI. 14:3, 6; Callaway 1980: Fig. 125:38,42). INVERTED-RIM BOWLS Deep bowls with a flattened inverted rim are a common third-millennium type, spanning the EB II- III transition. Carefully burnished red slips, especially those covering both the interior and exterior of the bowl (Figs. 8.3:4; 8.6:5; 8.7:4, 18) are more characteristic of EB II (cf. Callaway 1972: Fig. 44:23-25; Miroschedji 1988: PI. 23:18, 19), whereas the more common variety, with burnished red, brown, or black slip on the interior and rim (Figs. 8.3:5; 8.5:3; 8.7:3, 16, 17; 8.9:3, 5), or lacking slip (Fig. 8.5:4, 5; 8.10:8) may be found in EB III as well (e.g., Callaway 1980: Fig. 129, right column). The profiled rims of Figs. 8.6:6, 7, 8.8:4, and 8.9:6 may be considered typical of EB in (Harrison 2000: 349-351, Fig. 19.2: 11-17; but see Amiran 1978: PI. 23:21 for an EB II exemplar). Photo 8.3. Pottery from EB pits, fill, Str. 20-19. 305</page><page sequence="311">CHAPTER EIGHT Deep bowls with a tilted inverted rim comprise a transitional form to the platter-bowl described below. Here too, plain bowls with or without slip (Figs. 8.6:8, 9; 8.7:5, 6; 8.8:5) are not particularly diagnostic, while the profiled forms (Fig. 8.3:6) are generally assigned to EB III. Two slipped bases (Figs. 8.3:8; 8.9:7) may belong to bowls of this type. PLATTER-BOWLS These appear in two main varieties, red- or brown- slipped with continuous burnish on the interior and rim (Figs. 8.5:23, 24; 8.6:10, 11; 8.7:7; 8.9:9, 11), or the same with pattern burnish (radial lines and, where enough of the bowl is preserved, concentric circles) on the interior (Figs. 8.3:9, 23; 8.5:25; 8.6:12-16; 8.7:8, 9, 19, 20; 8.8:14; 8.9:8, 10; 8.10:16). Rims are usually triangular and an external concavity occasionally appears on both types. Fig. 8.6:11, well fired and burnished with a rather elongated rim, appears to be Northern Metallic Ware, typical of EB II (Greenberg and Porat 1996). The small and mid- sized pattern-burnished platter, though making an occasional appearance in EB II, is the hallmark of EB III . At Yarmuth, platter sizes gradually increase with time and very large platters are common in the later phases of EB III (Miroschedji 2000: 330). The absence of such vessels at the City of David suggests that, as for other vessel types, the assemblage covers the transition from EB II to EB III A but extends no further into EB III. VATS AND BASINS Spouted vats rarely occur at the City of David (Figs. 8.5:6, 28; 8.7:29). They are not diagnostic for dating purposes. The complete form of the basin in Fig. 8.9:12 may be observed in Arad Str. II (Amiran 1978: Pl. 23:23). Inverted-rim variants of vats or basins appear in Figs. 8.6:17 and 8.8:15. A KHIRBET KERAK WARE KRATER Fig. 8.10:17 is a rim fragment of a burnished red / black-slipped krater, a type that is well attested in the Khirbet Kerak Ware repertoire (e.g., Greenberg 306 1997: Figs. 111.2:9, 111.3:11; Mazar et al. 2000: 263). Esse (1991: 138) noted that only small vessels of this family are attested at sites south of the Jezreel Valley; the sherd from Jerusalem thus comprises an exception to this rule. Khirbet Kerak Ware is considered diagnostic for EB III, appearing from the beginning of the period at sites such as Dan, Hazor, Bet Yerah, and Bet Shean (cf. Philip 1999; pace Getzov et al. 2001: 16). HOLEMOUTHS Holemouths at the City of David may be divided into two groups, approximately equal in number: wide-mouthed vessels (kraters) and jars made of a coarse calcareous fabric, often poorly fired, and holemouth cooking pots made of a coarse fabric with crushed calcite inclusions, usually darker in color and more highly fired than the first group. Most of the examples in the first group have applied rope decoration beneath the rim. There are numerous minor variations in fabric and form. Holemouth kraters/jars with applied rope decoration. These appear in various sizes, ranging from 13 to 32 cm in diameter of aperture. While most of the forms are wide-mouthed and may be characterized as kraters (Figs. 8.3:10-12; 8.4:4; 8.5:7,8; 8.6:18-21; 8.9: 13-15), some have a more constricted rim and may be termed jars (Figs. 8.3:13; 8.4:5,6; 8.5:27; 8.6:22; 8.7: 10). The plastic band was applied separately to the body, and then pinched or indented. This is best illustrated in Fig. 8.9:15, where the applied decoration has been detached, revealing the indented surface below. The vessels were usually fired to a buff/orange color, and sometimes a creamy surface color was achieved, contrasting sharply with the darker fabric . Holemouths with applied rope decoration below the rim begin in EB I, are common in southern sites in EB II, and seem to decline in EB III (e.g., Amiran 1978: Pis. 8:21-23; 20; Callaway 1980: Figs. 65:10, 12, 14; 88:14, 15, 17-20; 137:12, 14, 16). Holemouth kraters/jars without applied decoration. This is a varied group (Figs. 8.4:7; 8.5:9, 10; 8.6:23; 8.10:4), similar to the first in</page><page sequence="312">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 21-19 (THE EARLIEST PERIODS AND EARLY BRONZE AGE) fabric and firing. Fig. 8.5:10 may be the rim of a spouted vat. Fig. 8.7:21 , with numerous limestone grits, should probably be classified as a cooking pot. Holemouth cooking pots. These are distinctive in both fabric and appearance, as they contain crushed calcite temper in varying proportions and are usually fired/burnt to a shade of dark reddish brown. The use of crushed calcite temper is characteristic of cooking pots from the Early Bronze Age onward (Goren and Halperin 2001). Rim shapes vary from thickened (Figs. 8.4:8; 8.7:14; 8.9:16; 8.10:9), to rounded (Figs. 8.3:14; 8.5:11, 12; 8.6:24-26; 8.8:6, 16; 8.9:17-19; 8.10:10), to squared or sliced (Figs. 8.3:16-18; 8.5:13, 26; 8.7:22; 8.8:7, 17; 8.10:11). STORAGE JARS The jars are generally of rather coarse clay, usually with crushed limestone inclusions , and are medium- fired. Lime slip, sometimes applied in thick layers (in one case over a thin red slip!), is quite common. Red slip, rarely burnished, is less prominent overall. Most rims fall into the following categories: 1. Plain rim, narrow cylindrical neck (Figs. 8.6:27; 8.9:20; 8.10:1, 12-14, 18). These belong to small to medium-sized jars. The join between neck and shoulder is abrupt. The type begins in late EB I and is quite common in EB II (e.g., Amiran 1978: PI. 15:6-9, 29-35; Callaway 1980: Fig. 93:1-7). The knob on Fig. 8.10:18 is reminiscent of those found on larger vessels at Arad (Amiran 1978: PI. 34) . Figs . 8 .6:28 and 8 .8:8 , which may be associated with Type 1 , are made of an unusually coarse fabric similar to that of the early pottery described at the beginning of this chapter and possibly predate the Early Bronze Age. 2. Plain rim, narrow flared neck (Figs . 8 .3 : 1 9; 8.5:14, 30; 8.6:29; 8.8:18; 8.10:15). The type is non-diagnostic and occurs throughout the Early Bronze Age. 3. Plain flared rim, wide mouth, no neck (Figs. 8.3:20; 8.4:10; 8.5:29; 8.6:28; 8.7:24). This is another type with a long pedigree in the Early Bronze Age. In the south, the form appears most at home in EB I- II (e.g., Callaway 1972: Fig. 27:15- 17; Amiran 1978: Pis. 12:10, 12, 14; Miroschedji 1988: PI. 20:9). 4. Heavy everted rim (Figs . 8.4: 11-13; 8.5: 15; 8.8:19). These are pithos rims, most characterized by a thick lime slip (for lime slips, see Amiran 1978: 48). It may be suggested that the curled rim of these jars is the predecessor of the folded rim of the following type. 5. Flared folded rim (Figs. 8.7:11, 25; 8.8:20, 21). Folded rims, sometimes slightly indented, are very common in both EB II and EB III. The everted "feathered" rim of late EB III is lacking in this assemblage. Fig. 8.8:22, with a flattened ridged rim, is a variant of Type 1. Fig. 8.4:9 is the rim of a small decorated jar, differing in fabric from the rest of the Early Bronze Age material. It may belong to the painted traditions of the Chalcolithic or EB I, or could be considered a variant of the white-slipped and painted jar of EB II, discussed below. Fig. 8.7:26, with ridged rim and vestigial lug handle, is a small jar/amphoriskos with parallels in EB III contexts at 'Ai (Callaway 1972: Fig. 61:30; 1980: Figs. 114:26; 132:22). In addition to rims, there are a number of other jar fragments: a variety of indented and wavy ledge handles (Figs. 8.3:21; 8.6:30-33; 8.8:23-25; 8.9:22, 23) , a plain ledge handle belonging to a line-painted jar (Fig. 8.4:14), brown-burnished (Figs. 8.5:16; 8.6:34) and lime-slipped (Fig. 8.4: 15) loop handles, and a number of bases, some of them white-slipped and painted (Figs. 8.5:18; 8.7:27; 8.8:9). Like many other features of Early Bronze Age ceramics, painted white-slipped jars are not intrinsically datable. The broad, irregular painted strokes can be found on jars from EB I through EB III, as the following comparisons suffice to show (Callaway 1972: Figs. 46:13; 66:6-17; Amiran 1978: Pis. 11:12, 13, 16; 33:5; Miroschedji 1988: PI. 24:20; Mazar and Miroschedji 1996: Fig. 18:18-20, 23; Harrison 2000: Fig. 19.3:9). Among the decorated sherds, the prominent 307</page><page sequence="313">CHAPTER EIGHT rope decoration (Fig. 8.9:24) and the white-slipped combed sherd (Fig. 8.4: 17) appear to belong to EB III pithoi. JUGS/AMPHORISKOI Rims and body fragments of jugs and/or amphoriskoi, slipped (Fig. 8.5:20), slipped and burnished (Figs. 8.8:10, 27; 8.10:19), or unslipped (Figs. 8.9:21; 8.10:5), are all of non-diagnostic EB II- III types. Among the bases , Fig . 8 .7 : 1 2 is a Northern Metallic Ware import. MISCELLANEA A misshapen miniature jar (Fig. 8.10:2) belongs to the class termed "second-rate" by Ben-Tor (1975: 16-17), often found in EB I tombs. Such ad-hoc vessels, however, are found in later phases of the Early Bronze Age as well (e.g., Kenyon 1960: Figs. 26.4, 5; 35.52; Amiran 1978: Pis. 26:21-24; 30:11). Fig. 8.7:28 is a fragment of a coarse, reed- impressed conical vessel that seems to have been exposed to fire. DISCUSSION The pottery of Str. 20-19 from Area E of the City of David comprises the largest Early Bronze Age assemblage published to date from Jerusalem. Contrary to earlier expectations (Shiloh 1984: 25), the bulk of the assemblage should be dated to EB II and early EB III, while EB I is represented only by stray sherds. While it is true that many forms in the assemblage are non-diagnostic, there is a clear lack of guide-fossils of local EB I, such 308 as red-polished ("PUA") wares in general, bell- spouts, pillar-handled jars, and deep incurved-rim bowls typical of late EB I, and there are no definite "PUB" line-painted vessels. In addition, there is a sense of the homogeneity in technique and fabric that characterizes EB II production throughout the country. Looking at specific contexts, the following may be observed: The floor and bench loci of Structure 26 1 2 (Loci 2604, 2167+2617, 2174, 2612, 2614, 2620) yielded mainly non-diagnostic pieces and types attributed to EB II, but also two pattern-burnished platters and a combed- ware fragment. The fills above these floors (Loci 1693, 1656B, 2182) included the full range of types, with a more prominent component of pattern-burnished platters. A sealed locus below this structure (2094) is not diagnostic. Unsealed fill loci above bedrock (2423, 2452) yielded pottery diagnostic of both EB II and EB III, as did "Cave" 1307. Loci 549, 604, and 605 (cavities in the bedrock) appeared to contain only early material, including the possible late EB I miniature jar (Fig. 8.10:2). In summary, the evidence seems to fit the following scenario: sporadic occupation lacking architectural remains in the fifth-fourth millennia, construction and use of broad-room houses in EB II, continued use in EB IIIA, and abandonment shortly thereafter. In regional terms, the City of David is contemporary with Callaway's Phases IV-VI at 'Ai and the earlier stages of settlement at Yarmuth. As the site seems never to have attained "urban" status, its desertion during EB III is consistent with the countrywide pattern of village abandonment during EB III (Greenberg 2002; 2003).</page><page sequence="314">THE POTTERY OF STRATA 21-19 (THE EARLIEST PERIODS AND EARLY BRONZE AGE) REFERENCES Amiran, R. 1978.

We have decided not to publish a full corpus of the pottery from the Roman- period dumps (Str. 5), as similar assemblages have been published from Jerusalem. We have, however, decided to present here some additional interesting material from fills and unstratified loci, mostly complete vessels, imports, and cultic and miscellaneous vessels (Figs. 9.1-9.5, Photos 9.1-9.27; a few vessels are presented only in photographs without accompanying description). Fig. 9.1 (Photos 9.1-9.7) includes Greek West Slope Ware (Nos. 1-3) and mold-made Megarian bowls (Nos. 4-7) with floral designs. No. 8 is a relief head applied to the shoulder of a closed vessel below its handle. No. 9 is a unique unguentarium made of dark gray clay with incised geometric designs and vertical burnish. Fig. 92 (Photos 9.8-9.17) includes lamps of various types. Fig. 93 (Photos 9.18-9.24) includes two red- slipped closed lamps with a high mouth, a handle, and a long nozzle (Nos. 1-2). Lamps like these, perhaps of Babylonian origin, were found in Tomb 14 in Beth Shemesh and are dated to the late sixth century BCE (Stern 1973: 206, Type 2). No. 3 is a cooking pot of the Hellenistic period found within the stone collapse on floors of the "Ashlar House" (Str. 10). No. 6 is the upper part of a Persian-period jar. No. 8 is an ointment vessel (see Hershkovitz 1986: Fig. 2:1-2). Fig. 9.4 (Photos 9.25-9.27) presents pottery of cultic nature. Kernos No. 1 , made of red clay and burnished, was found in a Middle Bronze Age level. Kernoi of this period are known from Hazor Area H, Str. 3 (Yadin 1961: PI. CCLX:18, 25). Kernoi Nos. 2-5 are made of brown clay, with red uneven paint. They come from unstratified loci but probably derive from Iron Age levels. Stand No. 6 is the lower part of a stand found above floor L1618 near installation LI 667. Nos. 7-12 are sherds of stands, some decorated with petals or incised decoration. No. 13 is part of a zoomorphic vessel. No. 15 is part of a wedge- shaped decorated bowl (for a discussion see Zertal 1989: 77-84). Fig. 9.5 (Photos 9.28-9.31) includes a set of lamps of different sizes, two votive (Nos. 1-3), and basins with white slip on the outside bearing knobs and rope decoration (Nos. 4-6). Only a few sherds of imported pottery were found in Area E. We present here sherds of Cypriot Base Ring (No. 7) and a White Slip "milk bowl" (No. 8). Also found were Mycenaean sherds (Nos. 9-10), a Cypro-Phoenician juglet (No. 13), and bichrome or black painted sherds (Nos. 11-12, 14-18). 331</page><page sequence="336">CHAPTER NINE REFERENCES Hershkovitz, M. 1986.

Because of shortage of time and funding, the material is presented with minimal discussion. In the small finds we include miscellaneous objects made of clay, stone, faience, alabaster, and stucco. Stone objects from this area were published in Vol. IV, apart from some bowls, stoppers, and weights that were overlooked. With the stone objects we include some previously unpublished architectural elements. The metal artifacts (Chapter 11) follow the present chapter. CLAY OBJECTS (Fig. 10.1) Dice (Fig. 10.1:1). The bipyramidal object has eight equal triangular faces. On each face are small holes, from 1 to 8 in number. The holes are filled with white chalk. Disc (Fig. 10.1:2). The object, roughly made from greenish-white clay, has a knob in the middle of one side. It was probably a lid. Knot (Fig. 10.1:3). The object, part of a vessel or figurine, is made of light brown clay, is black- slipped, and is partly burnished. Plaques (Fig. 10.1:4-5). Two large, flat rectangular plaques were found in an area disturbed by graves of Str. 7 and are perhaps connected to Grave 2162. No. 4 measures 1.70 X 0.70 m, and of No. 5 there are three fragments measuring 0.75 x 0.60 and 0.85 x 0.55 m. The plaques could be parts of an installation or lids of clay coffins. Clay coffins so far have been found only in the northwestern part of the country and in the Roman period (Aviam and Stern 1997: 151-162), while in the Persian period they are known in the eastern part of the empire (Stern 1973: 86-90). We could find no parallels of the Hellenistic period. STONE OBJECTS (Figs. 10.2-10.4) Among the small finds not published in previous volumes are a few miscellaneous stone objects, which include stone bowls, stoppers, weights, and architectural elements. Column (Fig. 10.1:1). The object, part of a window balustrade, is made of limestone and decorated with petals and a number of grooves below and above the petals. In the top and bottom are deep, square recesses into which other architectural elements were inserted. A parallel to this is known from Ramat Rahel Str. Va (Aharoni 1964: Fig. 38:1-3, 46-68). The column was found in a pit (L2040) that we relate to Str. 10. Mace head (Fig. 10.2:2). The fragmentary basalt mace head was found in a fill (L2004C) at a low level of the Middle Bronze Age strata and should most likely be dated to the Early Bronze Age. Altar (Fig. 10.2:3). The basalt altar, half of which is preserved, had four legs and a deep "bowl" lacking decoration. The top is worn. It comes from an Iron Age fill that was disturbed by a terrace wall of Str. 7. Stoppers and bowls (Fig. 10.2:4-7). Table 10.1 presents a list of the stone stoppers and bowls (only a few stoppers are illustrated). Toilet seat (Fig. 10.3:1).

On the top is a shallow groove connecting the perforation to the side. This stone was found in a small room of the "Terrace House," fallen on a floor of the Persian period (Str. 9). Two other stones like this were found, one in Area E and the other in Area G, where it was found in situ and is understood to be a toilet (Shiloh 1984: PI. 31a). Toilet seat (Fig. 10.3:2). A flat, square stone measuring about 48 x 52 cm, with a keyhole-shaped hole consisting of a round perforation and an adjacent triangular depression. Although it differs in shape from the toilet seat discovered in Area G, this stone too was found in a small niche between walls forming a small enclosed area, and sits above a pit. One should remember that the stone alone could not be positioned on top of a cesspit without additional support. Columns (Fig. 10.4:1; Photo 10.1). Pieces of limestone columns found in secondary use. Two were broken in half and the others do not connect, so they may have come from two or three additional columns. One stone is pointed at one end and has a small recess in the bottom, probably for connection to another stone. Cutting marks of a wide chisel and remains of plaster are visible. On one part were remains of red paint. The stones were found covering a grave (L2033) of Str. 7. Photo 10.1. Pieces of columns, L2033, Str. 7 (Fig. 10.4:1). Capital (Fig. 10.4:2). A limestone capital was found in secondary use as part of terrace wall W606. The capital is in Doric style and is dated to the Hellenistic period. STONE WEIGHTS Stone weights found in Area E and dated from the Early Bronze Age to the Persian period were published in Vol. IV (Eran 1996). Here we add four weights of a different type (Fig. 10.5:1-3): conical weights made of soft limestone, one each deriving from Str. 7 and 6 and two unstratified. The description here is based on notes made by A. Eran. 1 . Smooth conoid weight made of soft limestone, with flat base and flat top, slightly damaged (Fig. 10.5:1). Height 3 cm, base diameter 3 cm, weight 24.9 g. 2. Roughly made conical/pyramidal weight made of soft limestone, with flat squarish base and pointed top, slightly damaged (Fig. 10.5:2). Height 4 cm, base diameter 3.4 cm, weight 40.0 g. 3. Rounded weight with pointed top and flat base, surface roughly worked, made of soft limestone (Fig. 10.5:3). Height 5.1 cm, base diameter 3.6 cm, weight [73.8 g] ca. 74.3 g (= 10 x 7.43 g = 5 x 14.84 g). 4. Roughly made conical weight, oval base and pointed top, made of soft limestone (not illustrated). Not worked by a circulatory process; slightly damaged. Height 3 .7 cm, base diameter 2.8/2.4 cm, weight [21.9 g]. LEAD WEIGHTS Three previously unpublished lead weights were found in Area E. The two stratified examples were found in the dumps, related to Str. 5. 1. Rectangular weight with string marks or scratches on one side slightly damaged (Fig. 10.5:4). Height 1.1 cm, base 3.5 x 3.7 cm, weight 136.5 g. 2. Cylindrical weight with a wide round base and narrower rectangular top (damaged), and a perforation about 0 .4 cm from the top (Fig. 10.5:5).

ALABASTER About 13 pieces of alabaster were found in Area E, most of which can be related to closed vessels. A few pieces come from Iron Age loci, but most are from Hellenistic and Persian loci. Table 10.2 presents a list of the alabaster vessels. FAIENCE Thirteen pieces of faience were found. Seven of these can be identified as fragments of bowls, and this is most likely the case for the rest of them as well. Almost all the pieces are from either the Roman-period dumps or Hellenistic fills. Table 10.3 presents a list of the faience pieces. FRESCO AND STUCCO Fragments of fresco and stucco were found in the dumps of the Roman period. Some were white fresco with paint in bright colors: green, yellow, brown, red, black, and blue. Some stucco pieces had relief profiles. Table 10.2. Alabaster objects. No. Object Reg. No. Locus Str. Fig. 1 Rim (juglet?)

Ariel. Unfortunately, the metal finds were relocated only at the end of our renewed work. Lacking time and funding, we decided to publish the material as a catalogue and publish all the available drawings and photographs (Fig. 11.1; Photos 11.1-11.3). The material is presented here according to types, divided into three groups; 1) personal objects - ornaments, pins, needles, etc.; 2) weapons - arrowheads, spears, etc.; and 3) tools - nails, knives, etc. Many of the objects come from poorly stratified loci, such as dumps, foundation trenches, and pits. Most objects are of well-known types, such as the fibulae from the Persian and Hellenistic periods (Nos. 13-22) or the triangular arrowheads (Nos. 55-57), found in contexts no earlier than Str. 7. Other arrowheads, made of iron, occur no earlier than Str. 15-14. Two objects are worthy of special note. The first is two pieces of folded-up gold leaf (No. 54), which date from the later phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Str. 17a). The other is part of an iron saw blade (No. 110), 5.1 cm long and * Copies of his reports are in the Site Files of the IAA archive. 2.1 cm wide, with three fastening holes, found in L1616 of Str. 15-14.

The scattered human skeletal remains found in Area H in the destruction levels associated with the Roman conquest of 70 CE were described by Smith et al. (1992). These, together with three crania of the same period described by Hewin (1995), comprise the only anthropological reports published to date from this important site. In this chapter we describe the human skeletal remains recovered from Area E (Table 12.1).* The Hellenistic interments of Str. 7B, which comprise the bulk of the sample described here, were recovered in most cases from cist tombs dug into the underlying strata of the Iron and Middle Bronze Ages. The tombs were oriented in a north-south direction, with the head of the interred usually pointing north and the body lying in an extended position. Details of stratigraphy, tomb construction, and burial contexts for the individuals found in the cemetery in Area E North, with plans and photographs, are reported in Vol. VIIA, Chapter 4. 1 Laboratory of Bio-Anthropology and aDNA, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Hadassah Faculty of Dental Medicine). 2 National Natural History Collections, Faculty of Life Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. * All the human remains recovered in the City of David excavations were handed to the IAA for reburial. METHODS All bones were examined using standard procedures. Identification and measurements were carried out as described in Bass (1971). Age estimations of children were based on tooth eruption and bone length; for adults, dental attrition and arthritic changes in joint surfaces or cranial suture closure were used. Long bone measurements were used to assess stature after Trotter and Gleser (1958) and hypoplastic defects of the teeth were recorded after Smith and Peretz (1986). INVENTORY OF INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED HELLENISTIC (Str. 7B) Human remains from 13 of the Hellenistic burials were examined and are described below. Area E North, L1288 (Sq. 0/2-3); age: adult, 40-50 years; sex: male Burial pattern This skeleton was found in a cist tomb, the poorly preserved sides of which comprised hewn stones standing on their narrow ends. As can be seen from Fig. 12.1 and Photo 12.1, the dimensions of this tomb were only just large enough to accommodate the burial. The tomb was orientated north-south, with the head to the north, like the burial in L1313 (see below). The burial was covered by a fill containing Hellenistic pottery 365</page><page sequence="368">CHAPTER TWELVE Table 12.1 . Inventory of skeletal remains from Area E.

The lower left second and third molars and central incisor had been lost some time before death, since the tooth sockets had healed. All other teeth were present but heavily worn with secondary dentine exposed on the molars and hypoplastic defects of the tooth enamel (Photo 12.2). A large abcess cavity was present in the socket of the missing lower left second molar. There were heavy deposits of calculus around 366</page><page sequence="369">THE HUMAN REMAINS Photo 12.2a.

Postcranial remains included the right clavicle, the left humerus, fragments of the scapula, the left and right ulnae and radii, the sternum, cuboids, femora, vertebrae, and phalanges. Stature estimated from the left humerus , which had a maximum length of 29 cm, was approximately 160 cm. Area E North, L1313 (Sq. 0/4); age: adult, 45-50 years; sex: male Burial pattern The skeleton was found in a fairly well preserved cist tomb lined by hewn stones standing on their narrow ends and medium-sized field stones (Fig. 12.2 and Photo 12.3). The tomb was only 1.65 m long and 60 cm wide, so that it was barely long enough for an extended adult burial. It was orientated in a north-south direction. This skeleton lay with the head facing north and the hands crossed in the center of the body. The roof had collapsed, damaging the skeleton inside, especially the skull. Stratigraphically the burial is within a Hellenistic intrusion into an Iron Age layer and lies in an Fig. 12.2. The burial in L1313. Photo 12.3. Extended primary burial of adult male in L1313.

Although the ceramic content of the tomb included a few sherds from the Middle Bronze and Iron Ages, Hellenistic material predominated. Skeleton Most of the skull, mandible and left side of the skeleton were present. The morphometry of the Photo 12.4b. Superior view of cranium from L1313. Note fused sutures and interparietal depression. skull and mandible indicated that this was an older male (Photos 12.4a-c and Photo 12.5). The sagittal suture was closed with a marked interparietal depression. While this depression is probably age-related, the right side of the skull showed irregular layers of reparative bone, apparently due to a chronic infectious lesion, on the frontal bone. This extended onto the parietal and temporal bones posteriorly and the zygomatic suture anteriorly. The mastoid process was very broad and robust but the long bones were gracile. The cranium had been flattened by pressure of overlying rocks and earth, resulting in considerable deformation. Head length was approximately 186 mm. On the left side of the upper jaw, the posterior portion of the palate was missing, together with the molar teeth. In the lower jaw (Photo 12.5a), all teeth were present but heavily worn, with secondary dentine exposed, heavy deposits of calcalus and peri-apical abcesses. The left first molar showed an oblique abraded wear pattern on the buccal aspect, extending onto the root (Photo 12.5b), and the crown of the homologous tooth on the 368</page><page sequence="371">THE HUMAN REMAINS Photo 12.5a.

This pattern of attrition resembles that seen in the individual from Locus 1288 and represents a more advanced stage of wear, probably from the same cause, an occupation such as basketry or leather working. Area E North, L1363 (Sq. P/4); age: 40-50 years; sex: male? Burial pattern The skeleton was found with its legs pointing south. Two parallel rows of stones, possibly the remains of a cist tomb, were placed on either side. The bones were badly fragmented, as they were jammed between potsherds and stones. An amphora base was found with the skeleton. Skeleton Since the stones and potsherds found together with the human remains had pressed on the skull, it was very flattened and broken, with few reconstructable pieces. Some pieces of charcoal were found beneath the cranium, though no evidence of burning was present on the bones. Skeletal remains represented were cranial and mandibular fragments, ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and scattered phalanges. The bones were robust, suggesting that this was a male, but they were too fragmentary for reliable sex determination. Age was based upon wear of isolated teeth. Area E North, L2005 (Sq. Q/4); age: adult; sex: unknown Burial pattern The tomb, 1 .70 m long and 60 cm wide, was stone- lined all around and covered with hewn limestone slabs. In the southeastern corner, Hellenistic pottery was uncovered under large stones. Skeleton The southern area of the burial yielded fragmentary remains of a human cranium and a tooth. The thickness of the cranial fragments and condition of the tooth are indicative of an adult individual. The northern section of the burial yielded very small, non-diagnostic fragments of long bone shafts. Due to their poor preservation it was difficult to attribute them to specific limbs, though it seems likely that they are part of the lower torso and legs of the adult found in this locus. Thus it would seem that in this tomb the head pointed to the south. Area E North, L2033 (Sq. S/5); age: adult, 50-60 years; sex: male Burial pattern The tomb, 2.20 m long and 50-70 cm wide, was 369</page><page sequence="372">CHAPTER TWELVE well-built and covered by five column drums in secondary use. Skeleton Of the cranial remains, only one piece of mastoid process was present; its size and robusticity (as well as those of the long bones) enabled us to identify the sex of the individual as male. Three teeth were present: lower left central incisor, lower right lateral incisor, and lower right canine. All had severe attrition exposing secondary dentine. The lateral incisor had a carious lesion in the enamel that had penetrated deep into the tooth. All teeth had hypoplastic defects in the cervical region , indicative of disease or malnutrition in early life (Smith and Peretz 1986). Postcranial remains comprised the right calcaneum, left and right fibulae, left and right proximal ulnae, phalanges, vertebrae and acetabulum of the pelvis. Bony outgrowths (osteophytes) were present on the articular ends of all the long bones, as well as on the vertebrae, phalanges and calcaneum. These growths are indicative of osteoarthritis. Area E North, L1941 (Sq. T/4); age: adult, 20 years; sex: male? Burial pattern This tomb made use of an earlier wall on its west side, while the east side consisted of irregular stones standing on their narrow ends. The tomb was surmounted by large cover stones. The head was orientated to the north. Skeleton A few fragments of very brittle bone were present in this locus. Some cranial fragments were identified, as well as four teeth: a lower right central incisor, upper left central incisor and lateral incisor, and upper right second molar. Hypoplastic defects were present on the cervical third of all teeth. Postcranial bones identified were left and right distal humeris, the left proximal ulna, right distal tibia, left proximal femur, phalanges, and a fragment of a calcaneum. Area E North, L1948 (Sq. T-U/5); age: adolescent, 15 years; sex: unknown Burial pattern This tomb made use of an earlier wall on the west side, while on the east and north it was lined by field stones standing on their narrow ends. An iron knife was found in the tomb. Skeleton The remains of this individual were highly fragmented but included both cranial and postcranial bones. The cranial remains comprised two broken fragments and nine teeth: the lower left incisors and premolars, the lower right lateral incisor, second molar and erupting third molar, as well as upper right and left canines. All the teeth had hypoplastic defects on the cervical third. Dental attrition on all teeth was minimal. The postcranial remains were left distal humerus , right proximal ulna, phalanges, rib fragments, and vertebrae. All the epiphyses of these bones were unfused and together with the eruption stage of the third molar and minimal dental attrition, indicated that the individual was an adolescent. Due to the fragmentary condition of the bones, sex could not be determined. Area E North, L1569 (Sq. U/4); age: adult, 20-25 years; sex: male? Burial pattern This tomb made use of an earlier wall on the west side, while on the east and north it was lined by large and medium-sized stones. Skeleton The fragmentary skeleton of a young individual was present in this locus. The cranium was represented by parts of the right parietal and temporal bones including the mastoid process 370</page><page sequence="373">THE HUMAN REMAINS and part of the right occipital boneThe mastoid process was large and broad, indicating that this was probably a male individual. Loose teeth were: a lower right third molar, upper right canine, and upper third molar. All teeth had hypoplastic lesions on the cervical third. The postcranial remains included fragments of vertebrae, ribs, proximal and distal ends of the left ulna, right fibula shaft, right and left proximal tibiae, ilium fragment from the left pelvis, right patella, calcaneum, cuboid bones, and phalanges. Area E West, L1248 (Sq. M/2); age: adult; sex: unknown Burial pattern Human bones were found alongside a Hellenistic cooking pot in the stone collapse of LI 248 in Sq. M/2 in Area E West, that are probably associated with the foundation trench (L1285) of W261 (Str. 7). Skeleton Various fragments belonging to an adult individual were found in a disturbed area together with animal bones and Hellenistic pottery. They comprised: the distal end of a left clavicle, the margin of a left scapula, the proximal end of a femur, and a phalanx. Area E2, L1438 (Sq. H-I/8); 2 individuals: (i) age: adult, 30-50 years; sex: female (ii) age: child, 5-6 years; sex: unknown Burial pattern The tomb was oriented to the southwest. The roof was composed of six large stones with flattened sides facing into the tomb. The floor was made of unworked stones laid side by side on top of which was a gray beaten surface upon which the skeletons lay. The south and north sides were unworked and sealed by large stones. The east wall was incomplete. Hellenistic ceramics were recovered from the tomb. Photo 12.6. Extended burial of the adult female in L1438. Skeletons The adult skeleton lay with its head to the southwest (Photo 12.6). The body was extended with the arms alongside the body. The skull was badly broken. Fragments of the right parietal, a large and broad left mastoid process, and right and left occipital bones were identified together with part of the palate. Part of the left side of the mandible was present with the third molar in place; all other teeth were missing post mortem. Postcranial remains identified were foot bones (calcaneum, navicular, talus, and cuneiform), part of the left fibula, left and right tibiae and femora, pelvis, the atlas vertebra, and two thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae. The bones were gracile; the diameter of the head of the femur was 36 mm and the diameter of the neck of the femur 22 mm, indicating that this was a female. The child, found in the same tomb, was represented by shafts of both humeri and several pelvic fragments. Due to their fragmentary state, the age and sex of this child could not be determined but it was certainly younger than 12 years. Area E2, L1439 (Sq. 1/8); age: adult, 40-50 years sex: male? Burial pattern This tomb, located just north of L1438, had collapsed, leaving only the southern part, closed 371</page><page sequence="374">CHAPTER TWELVE Photo 12.7. Burial of an adult, possibly male, in LI 439. Note the numerous breaks in the bones resulting from the roof fall. by large stones. The stones lining the grave were worked on only one side. Skeleton The skeleton was aligned in a north-south direction, on its back, with its head to the north (Photo 12.7). The skull was badly damaged; one small portion of the mandible was recovered together with fragmentary remains of the rest of the skeleton. The mandibular fragment had part of the corpus intact and showed ante-mortem loss of a premolar, indicating that this was a mature adult. Other bones identified were part of the right scapula and clavicle, both humeri, and ulnae, left radius, sacrum, pelvis, and both femora. The bones were robust; the diameter of the head of the femur measured 38 mm and that of the neck 27 mm, suggesting that this individual was male. Area E2, L1442 (Sq. 1/8); 2 individuals: (i) age: adult; sex: male? (ii) age: child: age&lt;12; sex: unknown Burial pattern The remains were found in a cist 12.6 burial that was partly excavated, as it continued into the baulk at the northern boundary of the locus . The beginning of stone walling was evident in the south and once fully uncovered revealed the burial pattern. Skeleton Present were the left and right ulnae, the left tibia and fibula, and navicular and cuboid bones of an adult. In addition, a small talus bone was recovered that belonged to a child, aged less than 12 years Area E2, L1440 (Sq. J/8); age: infant, 2-3 years; sex: unknown Burial pattern The skeleton was found in a stone collapse that is dated to the Hellenistic period. Skeleton The child is represented by fragments of ribs, vertebrae, and long bones, all with unfused epiphyses. A right mandible fragment with an erupting second deciduous molar was present and was used for age estimation. MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II (Str. 18-17) Remains of two children were recovered from this period. Area E West, L1652 (Sq. M/20); age: infant, &lt;6 months; sex: unknown Burial pattern This infant was found in a cave cut into the bedrock, associated with an MB II cylinder juglet and a scarab. Skeleton Most of the bones were present but fragmentary. Three tooth germs were found and used to age this individual. Area E North, L2603A (Sq. R/5); age: child, 1.5-2 years; sex: unknown Skeleton This was a poorly preserved, contracted primary burial covered by potsherds and lying in fill relating to the MB E city wall. The head was wedged against 372</page><page sequence="375">THE HUMAN REMAINS the wall. Cranial fragments and part of the right side of the mandible with deciduous teeth were identified, together with most of the rest of the skeleton. EARLY BRONZE AGE (Str. 20) Area E North; L1307 (Sq. 0/3); age: child, 2-3 years; sex: unknown Burial pattern The skeletal remains of a young child were found at a depth of 2.10 m from the entrance of a shaft in the bedrock. The shaft was discovered at the end of the 1980/81 excavation season, and cleared to the depth of the skeleton. Due to lack of time it was not removed but covered over and left for the following season. This, as it transpired, was not a wise decision, for seepage of water and debris into the hole accelerated the decay of the bone and confused the cultural context of the material removed in the 1981/82 season. The child was found at a point in the shaft where the rock wall widens to form a niche. The bones were poorly preserved and lay in a damp clay matrix that adhered to them and made recovery difficult. The actual burial position was difficult to discern due to the high degree of fragmentation, but the body appears to have been placed head first into the niche with the feet pointing towards the shaft entrance. Skeleton The skeleton was represented by fragments of the cranium, ribs, fibula, and tibia as well as a few scattered phalanges and part of the mandible with teeth. MIXED PERIODS Area E2, L1418 (Sq. I- J/7); age: adult, 30-40 years; sex: female Burial pattern The skeletal material was found in a rock crevice referred to as the "cave" in the excavation notes. This crevice served for deposition of debris over a long period of time. As a result, its contents were mixed and included material from the Chalcolithic to Roman periods, making it impossible to date the human remains. Skeleton The individual was represented by a mandibular fragment consisting of the left ramus and condyle. The lower first premolars are only slightly worn, with the dentine barely exposed on the buccal cusp and little alveolar resorption. The second premolars and first molars had been lost ante mortem. CONCLUSIONS The Hellenistic cist tombs in the Area E cemetery differ from the more usual stone-hewn burial caves used for multiple burials that characterize the Jerusalem area from the Iron Age to the Roman- Byzantine periods (e.g. Kloner 1980; Barkay 2000), as opposed to the coastal plain and the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys (the latter including the 'En Gedi region; Hadas 1994), where cist tombs are common (Tal 2003). The fragmentary condition of the skeletal remains from Area E precluded any detailed anthropometric analyses. However, as far as could be ascertained from the measurements and morphological observations described above, this sample showed no distinguishing features to set them apart from their contemporaries. These have been described by Arensburg et al. (1980) as characterized by mesocranic to brachycranic heads with medium facial height and nasal height-width indices. Similarly, the one stature estimate we were able to obtain, that of the male from L1288, was estimated at approximately 160 cm, well within the range previously reported for the Hellenistic- Roman population of 'En Gedi (157-174 cm for males and 141-165 cm for females; Arensburg and Belfer-Cohen 2007). The age distribution of the 15 individuals recovered from the Hellenistic burials in the City of 373</page><page sequence="376">CHAPTER TWELVE David, 11 adults, 1 adolescent and 3 children, also shows that the cist burials were not reserved for a special age or sex category. While this is too small a sample from which to extrapolate life expectancy in this period (Smith 1993), the age distribution agrees with that reported for the period in general, with few individuals surviving past 50 years and sub-adults comprising around 40% of all those identified (Arensburg et al. 1981; Arensburg and Smith 1983; Arensburg and Belfer-Cohen 1994; Kahana 2004). All older individuals in the Hellenistic sample from the City of David studied here show a similar pattern of dental disease characterized by severe attrition, ante-mortem tooth loss, and periodontal disease. This suggests that their diet was abrasive but contained large quantities of carbohydrates. Caries was found in only one individual from the City of David (L2033). It seems likely, therefore, that attrition or periodontal disease was responsible for most of the ante-mortem tooth loss observed. The high frequency of enamel hypoplasia, a condition associated with disease and/or malnutrition in infancy, further indicates that the health status of this population was poor. This may reflect the socio-economic status of the interred. The fact that two of the males from the City of David (L1288 and LI 3 1 3) showed activity-related dental attrition may mean that this cemetery served artisans and their families. Certainly, the poorly built cist tombs are a far cry from the elaborate Hellenistic tombs found elsewhere in Jerusalem (e.g., Berlin 2002).

Shiloh. Since most of these objects were found in later contexts (mainly fills), the finds are described in the order of their date of production, with the exception of the speculatively dated Nos. 12-13. The items are illustrated in photographs and (in most cases) line drawings. An attempt has been made to list a large number of the excavated parallels as a basis for future studies. Where there is a previous scholarly discussion of a particular issue, I refer to that publication in order to avoid repetition. Parallels from collections are cited only when they are essential to the discussion. I have endeavored to standardize the vocabulary and the description of similar elements, features, etc. GENERAL NOTES In order to avoid repetitive notes, mainly of technical nature, several features that are common to some or all of the objects are discussed here. These are described under the same headings under which they would appear in the individual discussions of each of the objects. Material: Glazed steatite: All of the steatite scarabs were glazed.1 The original colors of the glaze, most probably blue or green, have faded to white or yellowish.2 Dimensions: The five dimensions used in this publication are (in alphabetical order): D = diameter, H = height, L = length, T = thickness, W = width. Seal Shape: There are two main classification systems or typologies that relate to the details of Middle Bronze Age scarab shape,3 the first defined by Alan Rowe4 and the second by Olga Tufnell.5 Neither is sufficiently accurate, and there is a noticeable discrepancy between their identifications. Rowe's classification system alone is used for the Late Bronze and Iron Age scarabs. For the classification of seals of other types (scaraboids, bone seals and conoids) from the Iron Age, we refer to Rowe6 and to the more detailed typologies offered by Keel.7 Base Design: The motifs are described from the reader's viewpoint. All the Egyptian hieroglyphic signs are referred to [in square brackets] in this chapter as they appear in Gardiner's Sign-List,8 with additional information given by Allen.9 Typology: The designs of the Middle Bronze Age scarabs are described according to Tufnell's Design Classification,10 with some later modifications made by Keel11 and more recently by Ben-Tor.12 For the 377</page><page sequence="379">CHAPTER THIRTEEN designs on the Late Bronze Age scarab we refer to Newberry's classification.13 Origin: An attempt has been made to determine whether a particular seal is imported or locally made. Daphna Ben-Tor has convincingly demonstrated that most of the early Middle Bronze Age design scarabs found in Canaan were local products (her "early Palestinian scarab series") , as were the later Middle Bronze Age examples (her "late Palestinian [scarab] series").14 I fully agree with Ben-Tor's observations regarding their local origins, but prefer to employ alternative terms for these two groups, since imitations of Egyptian scarabs were produced in Canaan during the Late Bronze Age (and later) as well. Furthermore, the territory of "Canaan" is wider than that defined by Ben-Tor as "Palestine". I thus propose to use the terms "Early Middle Bronze [Age] Canaanite Scarabs" (or EMBCS) for her early series, and "Late Middle Bronze [Age] Canaanite Scarabs" (or LMBCS) for her late series. Date: The factors used for dating are mainly scarab (or seal) shape, the preciseness of the hieroglyphic signs, carving style, and excavated parallels. My dating of Ben-Tor's "early Palestinian scarab series" (my EMBCS) is lower than hers by 30 years.15 1 suggest the following dates: • EMBCS: early MB IIB, 1680-1650 BCE according to Bietak's Low Chronology (= Tell el-Dab'a E/3). • LMBCS: late MB IIB and MB HC according to Bietak's terminology, 1650-1530 BCE, with a division between early LMBCS, 1650-1590 BCE (= Tell el-Dab'a E/2 and E/l) and late LMBCS, 1590-1530 BCE (= Tell el-Dab'a D/3 and D/2).

Drilling of perforation: D (max.) 12 mm, (min.) 6 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling and incising. Workmanship: Object - good, design - mediocre. Technical Details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Very large perforation occupying most of 378</page><page sequence="380">SCARABS, SC ARABOIDS , OTHER STAMP SEALS, AND SEAL IMPRESSIONS the height of the seal. Linear engraving and a few drillings. Preservation: Almost complete, with scars above and below each perforation edge. Seal Shape: Truncated conical seal with elliptical base. Base Design: Unclear motif that resembles a "disordered" fishing net, with some fish trapped in it. It is divided into two halves by a straight line. Two large drillings, one in each half, are randomly placed, while two small drillings are close to each other but separated by the main dividing line. Four shorter straight lines create a frame that was perhaps originally a hexagon. The fishing net motif, also with a horizontal dividing line, is found on a rectangular stamp seal uncovered during the Tel Qashish excavations.16 Typology: In its large drillings, this object resembles a stone seal found on the acropolis of Tel Yarmut that has two large cavities with a depiction of ". . . an extremely stylized caprine or fish".17 Likewise, relatively large drillings are observed in the lug handle of the above-mentioned stamp seal from Tel Qashish. Origin: Canaanite, locally made. Date: The stamp seal seems generally to belong to the Early Bronze Age, and more specifically to its first or second part. This suggestion is offered on the basis of the following considerations: • Such seals did not exist in the Middle Bronze Age or the Chalcolithic period. • This observation is supported by the seal from the acropolis of Tel Yarmut, where those periods are lacking. • The seal from Tel Yarmut, which was also found in an insecure context, was first identified as ". . .a redeposited EB seal",18 and later as an EB II,19 or even EB II- III, item.20 Othmar Keel dated the same seal to EB I.?1 • The rectangular stamp seal with lug handle from Tel Qashish is dated to EB I. Archaeological Context: L2169 is an MB IIB fill of Str. 17B. Consequently, the stamp seal should be considered as having been found in a secondary context. If our suggested date of EB I or E is correct, the seal originated in Str. 20 or 19. 22 2. Scarab, IAA No. 98-1151. Area E North, L 2135, Reg. No. 21531 (Fig. 132)23 Material: Glazed steatite, white glaze. Dimensions: L 15 mm, W 10.5 mm, H 7 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship: Excellent. Technical Details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Linear engraving and hatching. Preservation: Complete. Fig. 13.2. Scarab, IAA No. 98-1151. Reg.

Base Design: A central vertical cable made of two ropes coiled three times round one another, while the ends of each rope turn toward one another. The three lentoid spaces that were formed in the central cable are filled with horizontal hatching. An impression on a sealing made by an identical scarab set in a metallic mount was excavated at Tell el-Ajjul.24 A relatively close parallel was excavated in the Second Intermediate Period Tomb 3712 at Qau in Egypt, where each end of the ropes has the shape of a uraeus or cobra.25 Typology : Design scarab. This scarab belongs to Tufnell's Design Class 6C3, "Coiled and 'Woven' Patterns: Encompassed - central cable".26 Origin : Canaanite, locally produced. This is based on three considerations - the "firing mark", the hatching and the excavated Canaanite parallel. • "Firing mark" - a different-colored strip along the ridge on the scarab's back is the result of the Canaanite glazing process.27 • Hatching - the same type of decoration appears on another Canaanite scarab with the same class of design.28 • Excavated Canaanite parallel - the above- mentioned sealing from Tell el-Ajjul. Date : The scarab should be dated to late MB IIB-C on the basis of the firing mark, the hatching, and the Tell el-Ajjul sealing that bears the same design, all typical of my LMBCS group. Likewise, its relatively close Egyptian parallel from Qau points to the same time-span. Archaeological Context: L2135 is an MB IIB floor of Str. 17A. Consequently, the scarab may be considered as having been found in a contemporary context. 3. Scarab. IAA No. 89-1154. Area E West, L1657, Reg. No. 10702 (Fig. 13 J)29 Material: Glazed steatite, traces of yellow glaze. Dimensions: L 15.5 mm, W 11 mm, H 7 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship: Scarab - good to excellent, design - mediocre. Technical Details: Perforated, drilled from both sides. Linear engraving and hatching. Preservation: Complete. Scarab Shape: Rowe - HC 12 (12th-22nd Dyn.), EP 1 (12th-26th Dyn.), Side 2 (12th-15th Dyn.); Tufnell - B8-0-e6b. Base Design: Within a horizontal oval frame are depicted eight hieroglyphic signs in two zones: • Upper zone - two wdit eyes [D 10]30 with unusual extensions protruding from their lower parts.

The bee is standing above the nbw sign "gold" [S 12] ,34 Typology. Design scarab. This scarab belongs to Tufnell's Design Classes 3B2 "Egyptian Signs and Symbols: Symmetric Patterns - king of Upper and Lower Egypt" and 3B4 "Egyptian Signs and Symbols: Symmetric Patterns - Horus eyes ( wdit )".35 Origin : Canaanite, locally produced. This observation is based on two considerations: • Tufnell's Design Class 3B2 is absent in Egyptian Middle Kingdom as well as Second Intermediate Period scarabs.36 • The unusual writing of the wdit signs and the title "king of Upper and Lower Egypt". Date : The scarab should be dated to late MB IIB-C (my LMBCS group) on the basis of the fact that the wdit signs are above the nsw bit, the royal title "king of Upper and Lower Egypt", in contrast to the practice in earlier Canaanite scarabs.37 Archaeological Context: LI 657 is an MB IIB burial related to Str. 18-17A. Consequently, the scarab may be considered as having been found in a contemporary context. 4. Scarab, IAA No. 89-1148. Area E North, Dump, Reg.

Hollo wed-out engraving. Preservation : Complete. Scarab Shape : Rowe - HC 54 (18th-c. 20th Dyn., or later), EP 32 (lS^-c. 26th Dyn., or later), Side 30 (c. 13th -c. 26th Dyn., or later). Base Design : The Nomen - or actually the epithets related to it - of Ramesses IV (hqi mirt mrj jmn [-/?r]), the third Pharaoh of the 20th Dynasty. This variant38 has a parallel in Tomb 934 at Tell el-Far'ah (South).39 This is the second scarab with the "Year 1" Nomen of Ramesses IV, and the eleventh scarab of that ruler, to be excavated so far in Canaan.40 Typology. The scarab belongs to the general group of seals and scarabs that bear "Royal Names".41 Origin : Egyptian, imported to Canaan. Date : The scarab should be dated to the beginning of the twelfth century BCE on the basis of the royal name. Fig. 13.4. Scarab, IAA No. 89-1148. Reg.

Seal Shape: Rowe - Conoid.42 Keel - Conoid (Cone-shaped stamp seal) Type III, in which the diameter of the base is equal to the seal's height.43 Brandl - Conical stamp seal.44 Base Design: In a ladder-shaped rounded frame, only the left half of a scorpion has survived.45 By analogy with a conoid from Beth Shemesh, there was probably a second scorpion in tête-bêche position.46 Typology: The seal belongs to a small group of conoids from Bethel, Beth Shemesh and Gezer, all with ladder-shaped frames, that was identified by the author 47 Origin: Israelite [the United Kingdom] , on the basis of the seals mentioned above in Typology. Date: The seal should be dated to Iron Age IIA or the tenth-ninth century BCE on the basis of the seals mentioned above in Typology, and the parallel mentioned above in Base Design. Archaeological Context: L2085 is a Str. 10 pit dated between the second half of the seventh century BCE and the destruction of 586 BCE. Consequently, the broken conical stamp should be considered as having been found in a secondary context. 6. Scaraboid, IAA No. 89-1152. Area E West, L1358, Reg.

Seal Shape: Scaraboid, rectangular with rounded corners. Rowe - Scaraboid Type 7 - Plain Back and Side.48 Keel - Scaraboid Type II (scaraboid with vertical sides).49 Base Design: Apair of two-winged anthropomorphic male figures dressed in kilts is depicted without a frame. Such figures are depicted on an Israelite carnelian scaraboid from Carthage50 and on a limestone scaraboid from Megiddo.51 The figures are standing back to back on either side of a sacred tree.52 The basket-shaped signs below, and the eight small circles or dots, may represent a small circuit towards the observer rather than the usual exergue. Typology : Anepigraphic design scaraboid decorated with a cultic scene. Origin : Israelite product in Phoenician style, based on the above-mentioned scaraboids from Megiddo and Carthage.53 Date : The object should be dated to the ninth-eighth century BCE on the basis of the above-mentioned scaraboids from Megiddo and Carthage. Archaeological Context. L1358 is part of the Str. 6 dumps of the Early Roman period, and hence the scaraboid should be considered as having been found in a secondary context. 7. Scaraboid, IAA No. 89-1157. Area E South, L1312, Reg. No. 8500 (Fig. 13.7) Material : Bone, whitish. Dimensions : L 15.5 mm, W 14 mm, H 8.5 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling and incising. Workmanship: Good. Technical Details: Perforated through the seal's width,54 drilled from both sides. Linear engraving. Preservation: Complete. Seal Shape: Scaraboid, almost a square with rounded corners. Rowe - Scaraboid Type 7 - Plain Back and Side.55 Keel - Bone seal, a square with rounded corners.56 Base Design: Within an oval frame are depicted two figures in different zones separated by a double line. In the upper zone is depicted a lion, indicated by the mane and the lifted tail, walking to the right, with his head penetrating into the frame. In the lower zone (which should actually be turned 90° to the left) is depicted a human figure walking to the left, with his right arm raised.57 The body of each figure is marked by three diagonal 383</page><page sequence="385">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 13.7. Scaraboid, IAA No. 89-1157. Reg. No. E 8500,L1312. lines. This composition clearly differs from the Egyptian motif of "a lion striding in triumph over a man. . .",58 in which both arms of the human figure lie along its body.59 Three parallels are known: two are bone scaraboids, one from Megiddo60 and the other from Lachish,61 while the third parallel is a sealing from Tell Keisan62 that was most probably impressed by a seal of the same type. The Keisan sealing apparently sealed one of four sacks that contained a metal hoard,63 consisting of bronze64 and silver scraps hidden in a broken Bichrome II jug65 and covered by a large bowl,66 that was found in Loc. 635 of Stratum 9a. This sealing (No. 30) was dated, with the other three sealings of the hoard (Nos. 28-29 and 31), to Iron Age IB or the second half of the eleventh century BCE, most probably due to the date usually given to the parallels of Sealing 3 1 and to the Bichrome II jug. In my opinion, this date is two centuries earlier than the usual date assigned to this group of bone scaraboids. This observation is supported by the following considerations: • The find spot of the hoard -a courtyard -makes no sense during Stratum 9a, when it was exposed and accessible to all. • Careful examination of the stratigraphy indicates that the area above this locus, and specifically above Element 6100, 67 was disturbed all the way down from Stratum 6, 68 in which this sealing could have originated. • The Bichrome jug was already broken when it was used as a safe box. • Ladder-shaped frames such as those of Sealings 28-29 from Keisan are not found on glyptic material during Iron Age I. Such frames, however, do appear on Iron Age II seals, such as a scaraboid found near Tomb ZR 28 at Achziv69and a scarab from the same tomb.70 • Sealing 3 1 from Keisan differs from all the other known sub-groups of "Resheph and Baal-Seth" scarabs: winged Baal-Seth - Tell el-Far'ah (South) ,71 Lachish72 and Dor;73 raised hand Baal- Seth - Ashdod74 and Ekron;75 Baal-Seth as archer -Akko.76 • Moreover, the Tell el-Far'ah (South) scarabs, the only items that were found in early contexts, actually date from Iron Age HA. Typology: Anepigraphic decorated design scaraboid. Origin : Israelite, on the basis of the parallels from Megiddo and Tell Keisan.

Preservation : Complete. Seal Shape : From the design (see below), it seems that the seal was a bone scaraboid. Base Design : Within a horizontal oval frame is depicted a striding caprid, possibly an oryx,77 walking to the left. A small space-filler is placed in front of the animal. The striding oryx motif is known on several bone scaraboids from the following sites: Samaria,78 Beth Shean,79 Gezer,80 Beth Shemesh,81 Lachish,82 En Gedi,83 Ashdod,84 Tell Jemmeh85 and Tell el-Far' ah (South).86 Typology.

In Egyptian it means "Living Horus". It is interesting that the impression of another Hebrew seal with the same affiliation, but a space-filler of another type, appears on a jar handle excavated at Tell Judeidah.90 The use of space-fillers was apparently common on bone and ivory Judahite scaraboids.91 This combination appears on a scaraboid from Tell en-Nasbeh,92 a carnelian scarab from Tomb 979 at Achziv93 and most probably on a glass scaraboid from Samaria, where the falcon was erroneously identified by Rowe as a Ba-bird.94 Typology: Hebrew seal. Origin: Israelite, or locally carved by an Israelite engraver who had moved to Judah. Date: The scaraboid should be dated to the eighth- seventh century BCE on the basis of its paleography and attribution to an Israelite engraver. Fig. 13.9. Scaraboid, IAA No. 86- 404. Reg.

Behind is most probably the hieroglyph nb "lord" or "all" [V 30] ,99 or the phonogram nb100 in a vertical position. The third sign, in front of the monkey, is unclear. The monkey is the animal of the Egyptian gods Thoth and Khonsu. A relatively close parallel (also in dimensions) is a scarab from Amrit dated to the Late Period in Egypt.101 Typology: Design scarab. The scarab belongs to the group of "scarabs bearing Names and Figures of Gods, &amp;c."102 Origin: Egyptian.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS SUMMARY Objects: The objects are noticeably diverse in type: stamp seal - 1 item (1); scarabs - 3 items (2-4); conoid - 1 item (5); scaraboids - 3 items (6-7, 9); and seal impressions stamped on vessels - 5 items (8, 10-13). 389</page><page sequence="391">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Material : The 13 items are made of six different materials, both natural and artificial: limestone - 2 items (1, 6); glazed steatite - 3 items, with white or yellow glaze (2-4); black sandstone - 1 item (5); bone - 2 items (7, 9); and pottery (or clay) - 5 stamped handles (8, 10-13). Workmanship : The workmanship of the items varies as follows: excellent - 1 item (2); good to excellent - 2 items (3, 6); good - 4 items (5, 7-8, 10); mediocre - 3 items (1, 4, 9); mediocre to poor - 1 item (11), and poor - 2 items (12-13). Typology. Most of the items are rare seals or impressions that join very small and distinctive groups, including a scarab with the epithets of Ramesses IV. Origin : The origin of the items is as follow: Canaanite - 4 items (1-3, 12); Egyptian - 2 items (4, 11); Israelite (United Kingdom) - 1 item (5); Israelite - 3 items (6-8); Israelite or made by an Israelite immigrant - 1 item (9); Judahite - 1 item (10); and Hellenistic - 1 item (13). Date : EB I/II, MB IIB-C107 - 1 and 3 items (1 and 2-3, 12) respectively; Iron Age IA- 1 item (4); Iron Age IIA108 - 1 item (5); Iron Age IIB,109 ninth-eighth century - 2 items (6-7); Iron Age IIB, eighth century - 1 item (8); Iron Age IIB, eighth-seventh century - 2 items (9-10); Iron Age IIB-Persian period, seventh-sixth century - 1 item (11); and Hellenistic - 1 item (13). Archaeological Context : The archaeological contexts in which the objects were found are contemporary with the objects - 4 items (2-3, 8, 10); and secondary - 9 items (1, 4-7, 9, 11-13). CONCLUSIONS • Since most of the glyptic finds from Area E of the City of David come from secondary contexts, their primary contribution is to the reconstruction of the site's general history rather than the dating of specific loci. • The connection during the ninth-eighth century with the Northern Kingdom of Israel, or people affiliated with its workshops, is noteworthy. • The new glyptic material from Jerusalem, the majority of which is rare, should be considered a significant addition to the general corpus and its sub-groups. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The late Y. Shiloh suggested that I work on the glyptic material from his excavations in the City of David, an opportunity for which I am most grateful. Special thanks are due to Alon De Groot for his unrelenting pressure on me to publish these finds, and to Sue Gorodetsky who helped to bring this chapter to its final form. Likewise, I would like to thank Donald T. Ariel and Gerald Finkielsztejn for looking at stamped handle No. 1 3 . The photographs were taken by Ilan Sztulman ("Sztulman-Kessel Photographic Services Ltd") and Vladimir Naikhin, while the drawings and reconstructions were made by Shifra Eisenstein, all under the author's guidance.

Shiloh. The item is illustrated in photographs and line drawings, while the other members of its family are in most cases illustrated in only one of these media. An attempt has been made to incorporate a large number of the excavated parallels as a basis for future studies. Parallels from collections (the State Collection of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Hecht Museum, University of Haifa) are used only when they are essential to the discussion. The four dimensions used in this publication are (in alphabetical order): D = diameter, H = height, L = length, T = thickness, W = width. DESCRIPTION AND DISCUSSION Stone palette, IAA No. 89-1173. Area E, L673, Reg. No. 41961 (Fig. 14.1) Material : Limestone, yellowish. Dimensions : Palette: L 58+ mm, W 52+ mm, T Fig. 14.1. Stone palette fragment from the City of David, IAA No. 89-1173. Reg. No. E 4196, L673. 397</page><page sequence="399">CHAPTER FOURTEEN 17-20 mm. Cavities: D 36 mm, Depth 12 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, drilling, abrading and incising. Workmanship: Excellent. Technical Details: All the surfaces are polished to a smoothness resembling that of marble. The use of a compass for the planning of the design is clearly discernible. The low relief is achieved by linear engraving. Preservation: Broken; only a small edge fragment has survived. Shape: From the inner organization of the cavities (see below, Top Design and Typology), it is clear that the complete palette was rectangular in shape. All the edges of the base are beveled to a height of 3 mm by means of a diagonal strip 6 mm wide. On the basis of a find from Lehun (see below, Typology), it seems that the object originally had a matching lid as well. Top Design: A rectangular frame 3 mm wide surrounds eight (Fig. 14.3) or alternatively five (Fig. 14.5) round cavities (see below, Typology), each with a frame or collar 6 mm wide. The cavities are organized in such a way that their frames touch only diagonally, and some distance remains between those that are parallel or perpendicular. This design allowed the engraver to fill the gaps between the parallel or perpendicular cavities with a motif composed of lotus flowers. Typology: The object belongs to a very distinctive family of decorated stone palettes most probably used as cosmetic containers,2 which can be divided into five types. More specifically, our fragment may belong to Type A or B . Type A: Eight cavities with a winged solar disc in the center of each of the short sides (Figs. 14 J) The author has seen, more than three decades ago, a photograph of a complete palette of this type owned by a private collector. Here we use a fragment (IAA No. 52-7; Fig. 14.2) collected Fig. 14.2. Stone palette fragment from Tel Sera' (IAA No. 52-7). from the surface of Tel Sera' in the northern Negev during a survey conducted in 19523 as the basis for a reconstruction of the fragment from Area E (Fig. 14.3). The original reconstruction of the Tel Sera' palette4 has only five cavities and lacks the space-fillers in the shape of lotus flowers. Moreover, the winged sun disc appears on the long side. Type B: Five cavities with a rosette in the center of each of the long sides (Figs. 14.4-5) A complete palette of unknown provenance is kept in the State Collection of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA No. 1969-934; Fig. 14.4). It is the basis for our alternative reconstruction of the Area E fragment (Fig. 14.5). Here we encounter for the first time the corner decorations (actually quarter-rosettes) that are common to all the types of decorated palettes. 398</page><page sequence="400">A FRAGMENT OF AN ISRAELITE STONE COSMETIC PALETTE AND ITS FAMILY Fig. 14.3. Reconstruction with eight cavities of the palettes from the City of David and Tel Sera' . Type C: Four cavities with a rosette in the center (Figs. 14.6-10) The first member of this type was found in a cemetery at Deve Hüyük near Carchemish and was published by Woolley5 (Fig. 14.6). Another fragment was found in the excavations of Macalister and Duncan Fig. 14.4. Stone palette of unknown provenance (IAA No. 1969-934). in the Ophel of Jerusalem6 (Fig. 14.7).

Type E: Six, four or two cavities arranged in two rows and lacking the rosette and the winged solar disc (Figs. 14.12-13) Six cavities: the author has seen, more than three decades ago, a photograph of a complete palette of this type owned by a private collector. Four cavities: an almost complete palette from Beth Shemesh (IAA No. S.291; Fig. 14.12) was found during Mackenzie's excavations in "Site XXXIV.4".10 Two cavities: a complete palette found on Masada (Fig. 14.13) will be fully described by the author elsewhere.11 Three published fragmentary corner pieces (Figs. 14.14-15) may belong to any of these five types. Two were found at Gezer12 (Fig. 14.14) and the third at Tel Michal13 (Fig. 14.15). An additional group of undecorated palettes, all with five cavities, may be defined as Type F (Figs. 14.16-18).

Origin : Israelite, product of a stone workshop that was most probably active in Samaria.17 This suggestion is supported by the use of rosettes18 and lotus flowers19 on the Samaria ivories, and the use of the winged sun disc on seals from Samaria, Shechem and Megiddo.20 The wide distribution of the family, which at first glance seems to contradict my identification, is discussed below (see Discussion). Date : The stone cosmetic palette fragment from Area E seems to belong to the Iron Age IIB, and more specifically to the mid-ninth-eighth century BCE. This date is suggested on the basis of the following considerations: • The context of the fragment from Area E (see below). • The Tel Sera' palette was found together with "Samaria Ware".21 • The Lehun palette and its lid may originally have been related to one of the Israelite fortresses conquered during the mid-ninth century BCE by King Mesha of Moab (see below, Discussion). Woolley included some earlier finds22 in the assemblages said to come from the Persian-period military cemetery of Deve Hüyük H.23 Among these finds is the complete Type C palette. This act misled several scholars into considering fragments found in Persian-period contexts at Lachish and Tel Michal to belong to the Persian period as well. The case of the palette found at Masada, which is a typical late reuse of a much earlier object, will be fully discussed by the author elsewhere.24 Archaeological Context : L673 is a Str. 12 fill of the eighth century BCE (Iron Age IIB). Consequently, the cosmetic palette fragment should be considered as having been found in a contemporary context. DISCUSSION The distribution pattern of these Israelite cosmetic palettes, which includes Philistia, Judah, Moab and 402</page><page sequence="404">A FRAGMENT OF AN ISRAELITE STONE COSMETIC PALETTE AND ITS FAMILY Carchemish, deserves special consideration, since more than one explanation is needed for it. • The palette from Tel Sera' in Philistia is most probably plunder from the conquered Northern Kingdom of Israel that was brought to the site by an Assyrian soldier.25 • The same explanation could be given to the complete Type C palette from Deve Hüyiik near Carchemish. • The palette fragment from Lehun in Moab is most probably plunder26 from Jahaz (identified with Kh. al-Mudayna ath-Thamad) or Ataroth (identified with Kh. 'Ataras), Israelite border fortresses north of Dibon that were conquered by King Mesha of Moab.27 • The palette from Beth Shemesh and the fragment from Lachish in Judah were most probably brought there by refugees who had escaped from the Northern Kingdom of Israel. However the alternative possibility that these were Assyrian plunder should not be ruled out. • The items from Jerusalem were perhaps imported from the Kingdom of Israel during the mid- ninth century (the period of Queen Athaliah), or alternatively at the end of the eighth century by a refugee from the Kingdom of Israel. The palettes actually found in Israelite sites are two Type D items, one said to come from Samaria and the other possibly from Jahaz or Ataroth (the proposed origin of the Lehun fragment), and the two corner fragments from Gezer.28 CONCLUSIONS • The new stone cosmetic palette from Area E in the City of David joins other objects that point to Jerusalem's connections during the mid-ninth-eighth century with the Northern Kingdom of Israel , or people affiliated with its workshops.29 • Jerusalem is the only site in the country where representatives of three different types of stone cosmetic palettes have been found. This points to the importance and central location of the city in Iron Age IIB, during the mid-ninth- eighth century. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The late Y. Shiloh suggested that I work on some small finds from his excavations in the City of David, an opportunity for which I am most grateful. Special thanks are due to Alon De Groot for his unrelenting pressure on me to publish this find, and to Sue Gorodetsky who helped to bring this chapter to its final form. The photographs were taken by Vladimir Naikhin, while the drawings and reconstructions were made by Shifra Eisenstein, both under the author's guidance. Thanks are also due for their assistance mainly with unpublished material in the Israel Antiquities Authority to the following: Benjamin Sass, Avraham Eitan, Debi Ben- Ami, Noga Zeevi and Clara Amit.

Moreover, they connected it to one of the military campaigns of Sargon, Sennacherib or Esarhaddon; Aharoni and Amiran 1952: 55. 26 The fragmentary palette and its lid, found in debris resulting from an earthquake (see Homès-Fredericq 1995: 266), point to the possibility that they were in secondary use when broken, with only one complete cavity and the lid. They were most probably brought in this condition from the site where they were originally used. 27 Finkelstein and Lipschits 2010.
