<plain_text><page sequence="1">No. 20.] MAN. [1905. Solomon Islands. Woodford. Further Note on Funerary Ornaments from the Solomon 20 Islands. By C. M. Woodford, F.R. G. S., Local Correspondent of the Anthro- pological Institute. Communicated by C. H. Read, F.S.A. [Cf. MAN, 1904. 86.] Having just received the September number of MAN in which I read with great interest the paper relating to the Solomon Islands by Messrs. Edge-Partington and Joyce, I thought that perhaps some additional information upon the articles illustrated on Plate I-J. might not be unacceptable. At the time I received the magazine I bappened to be on a short official visit to Gizo, and as Ingava, the chief of Rubiana mentioned in the article, happened to be in the neighbourhood, I sent for him and showed him the plate. The old man was delighted and recognised every article illustrated. He told me that Figs. 1-5 were taken away by Captain, now Rear-Admiral, Davis from the natives of the village of Kolokongo at the time he visited Rubiana in 1891, and that the "bakeha" illustrated in Fig. 6 was presented to Captain Davis by himself. The three objects illustrated in Figs. 1-3 are known as " serenbule." It was the custom to place one of these in the bow of the " tomako," or head-hunting canoe, when on a head-hunting expedition. When not in use they were stuck in the grounid beneath, or in close proximity to, the small huts or shelters in which the skulls of deceased natives are kept. Ingava says that the very interesting specimen illustrated in Fig. a is known as a " po- robatuna " and assured me that it was not used as the door of a mortnary hut, but that, on the contrary, it was always placed inside with the skulls. Ingava's account differs from informatiou J obtaiDed about a year ago uDon the subject of a similar specimen, now in the Sydney Museum. My informant, a native named Keri of Java on Vella Lavella, then told me that the native name was " venu " and that it was used as a door for the small mortuary huts. I am inclined to think that the latter is the true account and that the place of origin of both specimens is the island shown on the cbart as Vella Lavella but which the natives tell me is called Vekavekala. I enclose a photograph of the Sydney specimen (Fig. 1), and you will observe that it also shows the small dancing anthropomorphic figures, but in this. case they occur in pairs or singly and not in a line. The panel of carving, if I may so describe it, interposed between each pair of the figures appears to me to represent the degraded form of human face. I should say that both specimens are the work of the same artist. [ 38 ] , Af~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. I.-" POROBATUJNA," NOW IN THE SYDNEY MUSEUM.</page><page sequence="2">1905.) MAN. [Nos. 20-21. I have recently obtained, . . ., fragments of another, apparently of verv anicient date. They were picked up on the site of an old "golgotha" at Narovo, but the m-ortuary huts had long since disappeared. So far as I can judge from the fragments, it appears to show the degraded human face (?) which appears in the Sydney Museum specimen. Of tile shell rings used by the natives of the islands of the New Georgia group (comprising Narovo, Simbo, Ronongo, Vekavekala, Kolobangara, Rendova, Vangunu and New Georgia), as ornaments or articles of barter, I know of the following varieties:- Hinu-ili are small rings of little value but frequently worn as ornaments. Five examples are shown in Fig. 3. IIohata.-Thin riings of tridacna shell, worn as armlets. Examples may be seen in Fig. 1. Poata.-Fig. 4. Heavy tlhick rings of tridacnia shiell used as articles of barter. Barehe.-Roiughly made rings of tridacna shell tused as articles of barter. I believe that these are niot made at the present day, the more neatly made " poata " having taken their place. Bcakeha.-Used as articles of barter, and when mounted as shown in Fig. 6, worn as ornaments. The riDg at the base of Fig. 3 appears to be an unmounted Bakeha. The yellow mark referred to by Messrs. Edge-Partington and Joyce is a sine qua' non in a bakeha and occurs only in fossil tridacna shells. I think a mistake has occurred in describing the small teeth round the edge of Fig. 6 as bats' teetlh. I believe them to be the teeth of the small marsupial opossum (Cuscus orientalis). A reference to the specimen in the museum will easily settle the point. Hokata and Poata are used for buying food, packets of dried almonds (bomboro), &amp;c. Bareke for the same purpose and for buying shields of basket work (lave). Bakeha, the price of men and women. Their relative value may be taken as follows :-One Bakeha equals two Poata and twenty Hokata. A Bareke seems to be rather more valuable than a Poata. . The extremely beautiful ornaments composed of flat discs of thin tridacna shell overlaid with a revolving disc of the most delicate tortoiseshell fretwork are known as " Dala." I am informed that they are made only on the island of Ronongo and are valued at two Bakehas. Formerly the large tridacna shells used for making rings anid ornamients were, after they had been ground down to the proper shape and thickness, pierced by chipping a hole and the centres were then cut out with the aid of vegetable fibre and sand. At the present day a piece of iron wire is used instead of the fibre, but the process is still a long and laborious one. CHARLES M. WOODFORD.</page></plain_text>
