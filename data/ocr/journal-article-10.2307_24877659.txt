<plain_text><page sequence="1">In 1970, UK-based Richard Ryder became concerned that animals were missing out on the 1960s revolutions against racism, sexism and classism. As a hospital scientist he believed that hundreds of other species suffer fear, pain and distress as much as he did. And while in the bath, he had an epiphany. Humans discriminated against these animals because of "speciesism"1 - a prejudice in favour of our own species. So he wrote and circulated around Oxford University a leaflet in which he asserted, evoking a confused view of Darwinism, "if all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum." He did not elaborate on this assertion, so presumably he assumed its truth was self-evident. ARTICLE BY: DR ALLEN GREER A philosophy graduate student, Peter Singer, read the leaflet, and in his 1975 book Animal Liberation2 identified "speciesism" as a major unresolved moral issue.The book launched the modern animal welfare movement, and anti-speciesism became a principal tenet of animal welfare philoso phy and the animal welfare movement. As developed in Animal Liberation, the argument against speciesism says that all OCT-DEC 2015 AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY 29 ARTICLE BY: DR ALLEN GREER Speciesism the Ismthat Isn't</page><page sequence="2">"Them is us' is precisely why sexism and raci don't make sense and why "speeiesism" dc sentient animals, including humans, have "interests," the most important of which is the avoidance of suffering, and humans have just as strong a moral obligation to give equal consideration to the interests of these animals as they do to the similar interests of humans. To not give equal con sideration to these interests on the grounds that the beings are not human is no more justifiable than to not give equal consid eration to the interests of some humans on the grounds that the beings are of the "wrong" gender or race. "Speeiesism,"therefore, is no different than sexism or racism. Furthermore, for a preference not to be "speciesist," every individual human, no matter their age or condition, would have to possess some characteristic relevant to an interest not possessed by any other beings. Virtually all animal welfare thinking agrees with this argument. The problem with this view, however, is that it ignores the basis of social cohe sion in humans. It is precisely because we belong to one species, with its implications of potential shared kinship and experience that makes what happens to any other member of our species more important than what happens to any member of any other species. In matters concerning our own species, we are linked to everyone else through our reproductive compatibility, that is, our actual or potential consanguinity, and therefore our potential to be in someone else's place. Conceived randomly out of the meaningless void as humans, any of us could have been born of either sex or any skin colour. We hadfas parents one of each sex, and they could have been of any skin colour. Our life-long partners can be of either sex and could be of any skin colour. We can have children of both sexes, and they could be of any skin colour. "Them is us" is pre cisely why sexism anHTfffttn don't make sense and why "speeiesism" does. Humans have created the only meaning in the Universe, and part of that meaning is preferential empathy for all other humans, the only; fceings potentially capable of our understanding of life's situation in the Universe.This includes those humans who either can not now or never could partake of that understanding, due to brain damage or defects, but who as humans at least had the potential for an understand ing that no animal has.Theoretically, brain defects and injury could be mitigated or redressed in a human, but no animal brain could be made human. Furthermore, human consideration for other humans is based on the realisation that anyone of us could suddenly find ourselves in a deeply dependent condi tion, and how we might be treated then will be determined largely by how we treat others in that situation now. Currently, this trust is extended primarily along family and "tribal" lines, but who would disagree that the extension of that consideration to all humans is our best (only?) hope? To put it in the bluntest manner possible, humans understand that what we choose to visit on another person can be justifiably visited on us in return by that same person or another interested person. If we discrimi nate against another human, we violate ourjspecies' social contract and poten tially forfeit the rationale for not being discriminated against ourselves, other than through the good will or restraint of our fellow humans. Furthermore, we can recognise and "punish"those who scam this reciprocal concern. It is not for nothing that one of the most enduring and concise precepts in human culture is "Do unto to others as you would have them do unto you." This is both a promise and a threat. This view is criticised on the grounds that the intellectually disabled, infants and very young children, the powerless and future generations would also be unable to reciprocate. But other people, be they kin or just concerned, can and will act for the disabled, infants and children.The least powerful individual can strike down the most powerful, if he is willing to die in the process, and future generations can The problem with this view, however, is that it ignores the basis of social cohesion in humans. 30 AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY OCT-DEC2Q15 "Them is us" is precisely why sexism and racism don't make sense and why "speciesism" does.</page><page sequence="3">IMAGE: 9 Possan - Flickr destroy the legacy and traditions of those now living. To understand just what is at stake in an anti-speciesism philosophy, consider some of its logical ultimate consequences. If we must discard our species as a basis for giving equal consideration to similar interests, then we must logically use sentient individuals as the unit of concern. An"individualist"approach in allocating consideration would require us to view all sentient individuals, at any one point in time, as existing in a continuum based on an equal consideration of their total interests. This continuum would contain every individual lobster, squid, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal.The continuum would not consist of discrete species seg ments; instead, brain deformed, disabled, senile and terminally ill humans would be scattered among the individuals of many other species, some of which might not even be mammals, let alone, primates, while some prime-of-life great apes would have positions well above humans. Furthermore, an individual's position along the continuum would be constantly chang ing according to their particular age, health and reproductive circumstances. Now consider what must happen if we are ever in the invidious position of having to administer limited doses of pain killer, a favourite animal welfare philosophy hypothetical, among all the individuals with burn pain in the continuum. In this case, anti-speciesist philosophy requires arranging the individuals according to the severity of their pain and then, starting at the extreme end, administering the pain killer until it ran out. In the aftermath of, say, a huge explosion in a large city where citizens imbued with anti-speciesist philosophy would bring in victims with varying levels of pain, those waiting for evaluation for equal consideration on the basis of their pain would include not only humans but also dogs, cats, pigeons, rats, turtles, fish and perhaps the odd crustacean. Or consider this. "If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account,"2 that is, such a being has no interests to which consideration need be given. Taken at face value this seems to say that if a person is alive but has no ability to sense pain, say, someone in a permanent vegetative state, they merit no consideration whatsoever and can presumably be treated any way anyone likes. As some treatments would cause strong emotions in at least some humans (close relatives, at the very least), this animal welfare philosophy argument must also be expanded to include an argument either against either those emotions as a class or against all emotions.The core of such an argument would have to be that these particular emotions or all emotions in general are not part of the basic biology of humans but remnants of primitive thought processes, ultimately treatable by rational In a world of competing opinion and neo-capitalist agenda, what is the current role of Ethics?

But if "talking therapy" were unsuccessful, what next? Gene therapy? Animal welfare philosophy also has implications for non-sentient beings. An animal welfare philosopher has written: "What is one to say to those who regard the painful deaths of millions of animals as a lesser evil than the loss of an endangered species, even when that species is an inconspicuous plant? (emphasis added)"3 Bearing in mind most plant species are inconspicuous, the logical extension of this view would seem to be that the'painful' death of even one sentient animal, say a sguid, would be a greater evil than the extinction of most of the Earth's flora. None, of this is to criticise the many gains that animal welfare philosophy has made in rectifying some conditions manifestly inimical to what animals are as unique beings. Instead, it is to make explicit a logical outcome of what animal welfare, as embodied in speciesism, sees as a major advance in human moral development. Whether human moral development will ever reach this stage remains to be seen. The principles and consequences of anti-speciesist philosophy have been known for more than 40 years, but the gains have been primarily in the alleviation of "unnecessary" suffering. Anti-speciesists believe, however, that it is only a matter of time before reason and morality prevail and the degree of suffering becomes our primary concern when dealing with all sentient beings. Possibly. But anti-speciesism's inability to move the general public beyond a concern with"unnecessary"animal suffering may reflect, in addition to the loss of material benefit, scepticism about the implied moral benefits and consequences of effacing the difference between our concern for our own and other species.The anti-speciesist argument may be cogent formal philosophy within its framing of the problem, but it has had demonstrably little effect in changing people's attitudes about "necessary"suffering and has disastrous theoretical implications for non-sentient beings (the vast majority) and hence the continuation of life. Empathise with thy neighbour? It is also difficult to see how a democratic society would effect the transition to an anti-speciesist philosophy. It would require humans either to reduce their concern for kin, friends and social group or to develop equally strong concern for a plethora of sentient beings, which they know nothing about and which are utterly indifferent to them.

Anti-speciesists warn that we will suffer "moral stagnation"4 if we do not accept their philosophy. But despite their views having been available for 40 years, they have provided no evidence for such stagnation. Anti-speciesists'arguments inevitably come down to assertions that we 'should' accept their views. They are as silent, however, about the costs of not accepting their views as they are about the benefits. They have put their case, but it has not been generally convincing. It is worth noting here that there is a rational and evidence-based argument that says that by extending concern for other species, we deepen the concern for our own species. Interestingly, animal welfare philosophers often mention this compel ling argument as supplementary support, they don't like it as a primary argument, because it is human-centric not strictly animal-centric. Finally, it is worth emphasising that one need not be an anti-speciesistto avoid using or sanctioning the use, let alone the harming, of any animal, sentient or non sentient. It is entirely logical to put any human first in the face of the invidious (and highly unlikely) choices outlined above and decline to use/own'or cause any animal to suffer at all. One only need value animals primarily for the uniquely evolved beings they are to hold the two views compat ibly. It is possible to be both speciesist and vegan. Indeed, most animal welfare con cerns would evaporate if humans treated animals in ways compatible with what they are. After all, if Earth were invaded by a superior being, what more could we ask (expect?) than to be treated in accord with what we are? Interestingly, if empathy, which is the issue here, occurs at all in other species, it is restricted to only three different bio logical groups of animals, all of which are, unsurprisingly, social: primates (humans, great apes and monkeys), proboscidians (elephants) and cetaceans (dolphins, por poises and whales). Empathy has probably evolved independently in each group, that is, it has evolved separately on at least three different occasions, and is therefore likely to have a slightly different form and stage of development in each case. Importantly, we "got" the rudiments of our own, empathy from our primate ancestors. But it is relevant to the "speciesist" view that in two of these three groups, primates and proboscidians, empathy seems to be confined to individuals within the species, not to individuals of other species; that is, the empathy is intra-specific and not inter specific. Empathy, therefore, looks very much like a "my own species"thing, which makes sense if it evolved as another adaptation facilitating cohesion within social species. The possible exception to the strictly within species nature of empathy is cetaceans, where there is some anecdotal evidence of empathetic behaviour toward other species of cetaceans. Intriguingly, there is even some evidence, some of it going back to ancient times, suggesting that at least some cetacean species may show empathetic behaviour towards a human struggling in water, helping them keep afloat or keeping sharks at bay. Cetaceans may have been especially suited for the evolution of cross-species empathy, because many species occur together, and they share common problems such as giving birth under-water to an air-breathing calf, similar predators and the hazards of stranding. But a cross species empathy with humans, if it exists at all, has a less obvious basis. If it does exist, its origins would be intriguing, both in its own right and in comparison with our own species'cross-species empathy, which is derived largely from an anthropomorphic view of other beings. In any event, the only species to which human might rationally 'owe'anything are some cetaceans.El AUTHOR: Dr Allen Greer is a biologist who writes about nature and science.
