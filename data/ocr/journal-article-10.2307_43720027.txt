<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW LATIN PSALTER: AN EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY1 V- PSALMS 9; 10 Ernest Lussier Ps. 9 A. Thanksgiving for the overthrow of foreign enemies B. An urgent cry for help against domestic foes . The Masoretic text is probably wrong in dividing Ps. 9 into two (Ps. 9 and 10) : the Septuagint and the Vulgate consider it as one; there is no title to the second part contrary to the general rule in the first book of the Psalter; finally, and this seems decisive, the poem is an alphabetic acrostic. There are consequently in reality 40 Psalms in the First Book of the Psalter, and, after Ps. 9, the Vulgate has the only correct numbering. It is, there- fore, unscholarly to abandon the Vulgate numeration in Book One in favor of the Hebrew. After Ps. 41 both numberings are incorrect since both the Vulgate and the Masoretic text divide a poem which is very clearly one: Vulgate, Ps. 41, 42; Hebrew, Ps. 42, 43. There are eight alphabetic Psalms in the Psalter: Ps. 9, 24. 33, 36, 110, 111, 118, 144. The alphabetic arrangement is a favorite literary device in all Semitic literature, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arab.2 According to ancient ideas it indicates a complete description, and was probably intended also as a mnemonic device and as a proof of the author's literary skill. Alpha- betization, however, is often stylistically bad, inducing an unnatural diction. It is used chiefly in Psalms of a proverbial character to connect detached thoughts, the poet using this artificial bond to unite together a number of variations on one theme. In Ps. 9A Daleth and He are missing. The text of B, especially is quite corrupt and the translation is not always sure. B begins with Lamed but Mem , Nun , Samekh are missing. Next comes Peh and 'Ain instead of 'Ain, Peh, this being doubtless the older order since it is found also in Lam. 2; 3; 4. Finally Ģadhe is missing, but verses 12, 14, 15, 17 begin with the last four letters of the alphabet in their regular order. The title states that the Psalm belongs to the Choirmaster's collection and that it is a mizmor (psalmus) of David, meaning that it was destined to be sung to a musical accompaniment. The title specifies further that the poem was originally set to a melody entitled "Death for the son." 1 Cf. Catholic Biblical Quarterly , IX (1947) pp. 226-228. * Cf. Rubens Duval, La littérature syriaque , 1899, p. 26-29. 196</page><page sequence="2">The New Latin Psalter 197 The substantial Davidic authorship of Ps. 9 creates no serious difficulty: the thanksgiving of A could have in view the expulsion of the Philistines from the north of Palestine, where they had penetrated at the end of the reign of Saul (2 Sam. 5:17-25). The disorders of the beginning of David's reign (2 Sam. Chap, e 2-3) explain sufficiently his urgent cry for help as contained in B. The theme of this Psalm is quite different in the two sections, but we should not judge the unity of an ancient piece according to our modern standards. Actually, it is quite natural that after thanking God for victory abroad the king should pray that all may be set right at home. After an introduction (A w. 2-4), in which there is already an allusion to the destruction of the enemies, David describes the judgment executed on the Gentiles (w. 5-7), and praises God, the righteous Judge and the Protector of the oppressed (w. 8-11). He then invites the people to rejoice because of the help received from God (vv. 12-13). Verses 14-21 repeat practically the same thoughts. The Psalmist implores God's help against his foes (w. 14-15); he describes their discomfiture (w. 16-17), and prays God once more to judge and punish the nations (w. 18-21). V. 2. True worship must come from the heart and not only from the hps; it must be complete, all embracing. David thanks God with all his heart; he makes it his duty and delight to recount God's marvelous works. V. 3. The name of God is His divine person as manifested by His attri- butes, here especially justice, power, and goodness. V. 4. The verse vividly describes the rout of the enemy: they turn back in flight, stumble in their precipitous haste, are overtaken and annihilated. From His throne in heaven God has pronounced and executed judgment on the wicked nations. So utterly have they been destroyed that their names are no longer known (w. 5-7) . This is a striking feature in the East, where traditions are so long and ćarefully preserved. God sits enthroned forever as King and Judge long after all His enemies have perished (v. 8). His rule is characterized by perfect justice and equity, and reaches all the nations of the world (v. 9). This last verse will find its supreme and final fulfillment in Christ (Acts 17:31). God is a ready refuge for the oppressed in time of distress (v. 10), and never abandons those who seek Him (v. 11). To seek God is to know, love, and obey Him. V. 12. God dwells in Sion, in the Holy of Holies, the throne room of the King of Israel, the earthly counterpart of heaven (2:4). It is from Sion that He manifests Himself for the help of His people (3:5). His mighty works in favor of His people are to be proclaimed among the nations around, to inspire them with reverence for God and His people. V. 13. God is presented as the next of kin (goel) of persecuted Israel (cf. Num. 35:19).</page><page sequence="3">198 The New Latin Psalter The poor are a class we often meet in the Psalms and in the Prophets. The appellation refers not merely to outward poverty but also to the meek and humble bearing of all that a humble condition implies. The poor are contrasted with the proud, the scorners, and the oppressors, and the word is practically a synonym for pious and devout, describing as it does the usual condition of God's worshippers. The poor are beatified by our Lord in the first beatitude (Mt. 6:3, Lk. 6:20). Vv. 14-15. Even in the moment of triumph David cannot forget the dangers which still threaten, and he implores God's help. Past experience, as described in the preceding strophes, inspires this petition for deliverance in present needs. V. 14. He is in peril of death, of going down to the gates of Sheol, the gloomy abode of the dead which is here conceived as a city with gates. God in His merciful kindness can lift him up from that awful descent. V. 15. For the Jews the gates of the city were the usual place of concourse and business, like the agora for the Greeks, or the forum for the Latins, or our modern town-square. The expression is then expressive of the utmost publicity. The contrast between the gloomy gates of death and the cheer- ful gates of Sion is obvious. By poetical personification the city is con- sidered as a young girl. The idea here, as in 6:6, is that public praise of God in His temple or royal city is something unique and especially acceptable to God, and that it cannot be had in Sheol. The Christian view of death as the passage to a joyful eternity is surely in striking contrast. Vv. 16-17. Wickedness has been made the minister of its own discomfi- ture; the sinner is ensnared in the work of his own hand. The pitfalls and nets used in hunting present this truth metaphorically (v. 16). The su- preme instance of this principle was seen when God made the cross an instrument of life as we read in the V exilia Regis , "On the cross Life suffered death, and by His death obtained for us life."3 Vv. 18-21. David now prays God to judge and punish the nations that they may know their human weakness. V. 18. May they turn back in defeat (recedant, cf. v. 4; 55:10) and die, since they have culpably forgotten God by their deliberate wickedness shown especially by their antagonism to God's chosen people. Rom. 1 :18- 23 stresses the guilt of the pagans in not knowing God who manifests Himself sufficiently to them by His works. V. 19. God in His own good time will relieve the affliction of the poor. God's enemies forget Him, but He is mindful of His pious servants. May God arise, as it were, from His slumber and judge the nations, mak- 3 Qua vita mortem pertulit Et morte vi tam protulit.</page><page sequence="4">The New Latin Psalter 199 ing them realize by some terrifying exhibition of power their inherent human weakness4 (w. 20-21). The second part of the Psalm (B) is an urgent cry for help against domestic foes. From the conflict between Israel and the nations David turns to the oppression of the pious in Israel by the powerful and wicked rich. He re- monstrates with God for His apparent indifference (vv. 1-2), and draws a graphic picture of the impiety (w. 3-4), temerity (w. 5-6), evil counsels (v. 7), plots and ruthless conduct (w. 8-10), and blindness (v. 11) of the wicked. There follows a confident appeal for the help of God (w. 12-15). Finally, certain of God's help, David rejoices in anticipation of a sure victory (w. 16-18). Vv. 1-2. The Psalmist expostulates with God for withholding His help and then describes the wrongs which call for redress. God is near when He manifests His power (33:19; 114:18); He is standing far off as an indifferent spectator or hides Himself, sometimes His eyes (Is. 1 :15) or His ears (Lam. 3:56) when He withholds His help. David justifies his complaint by drawing a graphic picture of the wicked (w. 3-11). The wicked man's lawless plundering of the poor is punctuated with posi- tive contempt for God (v. 3). The whole course of his life implies that God takes no notice of men (v. 4). There is no God is not a denial of divine existence but of divine interposition in man's actions (cf. w. 4a, 11, 13). Vv. 5-6. The wicked lives in false security, fearing neither God nor man. His affairs prosper, and the possibility of divine retribution does not enter into his plans or disturb his peace of mind. He laughs at anyone who opposes him. He identifies himself with his descendants and looks forward to an uninterupted continuance of prosperity. The malice of the wicked is described cogitatione , (v. 6), verbo (v. 7), et opere (8-10). V. 7. The evil man is proficient in curses, guile, and deceit. Mischief (labor) and trouble are compared to delicious morsels which he keeps under his tongue to enjoy them thoroughly (cf. Job 20:12-13). The wicked man is like a brigand waiting in ambush to murder and rob innocent and defenseless folk (v. 8), like a lion lurking for its prey (w. 9a, 10a), like a hunter snaring his game (v. 9bc). V. 11. He started from the assumption that God takes no notice of men (v. 4), and his experience now apparently confirms him in his belief. This is the exact opposite of the faith of the saints (9:13, 19). Vv. 12-15. David now prays God to vindicate His attributes of omnis- cience and justice by taking action against the wicked and so disprove their 4 Enosh (homo, 20a) denotes man in his weakness.</page><page sequence="5">200 The New Latin Psalter calumny (v. 12, cf. v. 11). He urges that God has tolerated long enough the blasphemies of the wicked (w. 3, 4, 11) and that it is now time to act (v. 13). V. 14. Contrary to what the wicked say, the omniscient God has seen (cf. v. lib) the pain and sorrow of the poor, and will take things in His own hands in His own good time. The orphan is mentioned as the typical example of the helpless who are under God's special protection. V. 15. May God paralyze the sinner's power for evil. The wickedness of the sinner will be destroyed forever when God holds His assize. Vv. 16-18. History as well as faith (cf. w. 12-15) make David certain of God's help, and he rejoices in anticipation of a sure victory. V. 16. This verse catches up the theme of the first part of the Psalm and rounds off nicely the poem underlining its unity. God drove the nations out of the Holy Land, and now the wicked will ultimately give way to the godly so that God's land will become in reality what it is in name, a holy land. V. 17. God, in fact, has heard the desire of the afflicted, He has filled them with holy confidence, and will see they get justice. The desire of the wicked (v. 3), on the contrary, in spite of their proud boasting will be brought to nought (111:10). They will no longer insolently defy God and do violence to men (v. 18). Liturgical Use Psalm 9 is used in its rank at Matins on Sunday, verses A 5b, 20; B 1, 12, serving as antiphons. The first part of the Psalm can easily be applied to the victories of Christ and of the Church against the enemies of God. The prayer of B is most timely against the wickedness and irreligion of the society in which we live. Ps. 10 The Unshakeable Trust of the Just in God Like the preceding Psalm, this one is a mizmor of David and belongs to the Choirmaster's collection. It is strikingly appropriate to the circum- stances of David's life when he was at Saul's court (1 Sam., C. 18). The Psalm is a little drama in two acts. David's friends advise him to seek safety in flight, arguing that it is hopeless to continue an unequal struggle, since right is subverted by the action of the central authority of the state (w. 1-3). The Psalmist replies that he has complete confidence in God, who, enthroned in heaven, sees all that happens on earth, and will destroy the wicked and welcome the righteous into His presence (w. 4-7). V. 1. Running away to the mountains like a timorous, defenseless bird pursued by a hunter would be unbelief as well as cowardice. The safety of the numerous caves and steep cliffs cannot match the protection David finds in God.</page><page sequence="6">The New Latin Psalter 201 V. 2. He is in deadly peril. Wicked men, like archers, are lying in am- bush for him. In obscuro implies not strictly darkness but secrecy and treachery. V. 3. The just man's efforts are fruitless when the foundations of the state, the fundamental principles of law and order and justice are overthrown. Vv. 4-6. David states his reasons for not heeding his counsellors' advice. They see only what his enemies are doing; he knows that a righteous God sits enthroned in heaven, and that ultimately the wicked will be destroyed, whereas the righteous will be saved. V. 4. The temple here is heaven as is shown by the parallelism. David has sought refuge (v. 1) in heaven, a place infinitely higher and more secure than the mountains, and in God, the heavenly King, who is constantly surveying the course of human affairs. "Eyelids" is used as synonymous with eyes, perhaps because the eyelids are contracted when we examine things closely. God marks closely and accurately all that men do in the world. V. 5. God's soul is a bold anthropomorphic expression for His innermost nature. God knows the secrets of all hearts and loathes the evil man. V. 6. He will shower down upon them burning coals and brimstone as of old at Sodom and Gomorrha (Gen. 19:24). A scorching, consuming wind, the simoon of the desert, will be the portion of their cup. The cup stands figuratively for what one enjoys at a banquet and represents one's destiny, happy (15: 5, 22:5) or unhappy (here and 74:9). V. 7. God's character is the ground of the judgment which has just been described. God is just and loves men whose acts are righteous (Is. 64:5). The reward of the just is in striking contrast with the punishment of the wicked. The wicked will be destroyed, but the upright will be admitted to the presence of God, like trusted courtiers who are permitted to approach their king (cf. Ps. 5:5, 6; 14:1; 139:14). The New Testament revelation (Mt. 5:8; 1 Jn. 3:2; Apoc. 22:4) widened indefinitely the meaning of this saying. The time of this retribution, punishment for the wicked and salvation for the just, remains undefined. The Psalmist must have had in mind chiefly the immediate solution of actual problems, yet it seems that here as else- where in the Psalter (cf. 4:7; 139:14) the messianic salvation looms in the background of the poet's thought. Liturgical Use Psalm 10 is used at Matins on Sunday (v. 7a).6 We are reminded that the triumph of wickedness is short-lived and that it is by righteous deeds that we can hope to enjoy God's protection. 5 The verses indicated are used as antiphons in the Breviary and give the key-note of the liturgical application.</page><page sequence="7">202 The New Latin Psalter The Psalm is found also on some feasts of our Lord and of the Blessed Virgin: Ascension (v. 4); Exaltation of the Holy Cross Sept. 14; Seven Dolors Sept. 15 (v. 2). Our Lord's love for, and trust in, His heavenly Father remained invincible, notwithstanding the persecutions He had to undergo. Mary bravely shared the sufferings of her Son and the blows directed against Him pierced her most pure heart (Lk. 2:35). Psalm 10 is recited for the feasts of the Angels: Apparition of St. Michael, May 8; Dedication of St. Michael, Sept. 29; Guardian Angels, Oct. 2; St. Raphael, Oct. 24. We find it also in the Common Office of One Martyr (v. 7) and the Office of some confessors, e.g., St. Martin, Nov. 11. This use is quite appropriate. The angels and the saints have reached the goal of eternal beatitude because of their unalterable trust in God. It could be, however, that the use of Psalm 10 for the angels was prompted by the Vulgate rendering of v. 6, spiritus procellarum having suggested the idea of the angels as the ministers of divine justice.</page></plain_text>
