The Foundation of Scientific Theism is the Philosophized Scientific Method. II. The Ground-Principle of the Philosophized Scientific Method is the Infinite Intelligibility of the Universe per se. 1. What is Intelligibility ? Ans. Intelligibility is the Possession of an Immanent Rela tional Constitution. 2. What is Intelligence ?</page><page sequence="2">Notes and 'Discussions. 433 Ans. Intelligence is: (1) The Sole Discoverer of Immanent Relational Consti tutions. (2) The Sole Creator of Immanent Relational Consti tutions. (3) Identical in all Forms, and in all Teleological. III. The Infinite Intelligibility of the Universe proves its Infinite Intel ligence, because only an Infinite Intelligence could create an Infi nite Relational Constitution. IV. The Synchronous Infinite Intelligibility and Infinite Intelligence of the Universe prove that it is an Infinite Subject-Object, or Infi nite Self-conscious Intellect. V. The Immanent Relational Constitution of the Universe-Object, being Infinitely Intelligible, must be an Absolutely Perfect Sys tem of Nature; therefore: 1. Not Chaos, which would be no System at all. 2. Not a mere Multitude of Monads or Atoms, which would be an Unintelligible Aggregate of Systems. 3. Not a mere Machine, which would be an Imperfect System. 4. But a Cosmical Organism, which is the only Absolutely Perfect System. VI. The Infinitely Intelligible and Absolutely Perfect Organic System of Nature proves that the Universe-Object is the Eternal, Or ganic, and Teleological Self-Evolution of the Universe-Subject ?the Eternal Self-Realization or Self-Fulfilment of Creative Thought in Created Being?the Infinite Life of the Universe per se. VII. The Infinite Organic and Organific Life of the Universe per se proves that it is Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Will?Infinite Beatitude and Infinite Love?Infinite Rectitude and Infinite Holiness?Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Power ? Infinite Spiritual Person?the Living and Life-Giving God from Whom All Things Proceed. VIII. Therofore, the Philosophized Scientific Method creates the only Idea of God which can at once satisfy both Head and Heart: and Scientific Theism creates the only Real Reconciliation of Science and Religion.
