<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEMITISTTCS Thorleif Bom an, Das hebr?ische Denken im Vergleich mit dem griechischen. 2. durch? gesehene Auflage. (G?ttingen, 1954, Van denhoeck und Ruprecht, pp. 186). The purpose the Norwegian theologian, Dr. Boman, has in mind in this book, which has quickly reached its second edition, is to en? quire into the relation between Greek and Hebrew thought. The justification of this en? quiry is given in the closing words of the book: (c We, the descendents and spiritual heirs [of Hellas and of Israel] cannot honor them better than by jealously preserving the two heredities, and finding, if possible, their synthesis ? (p. 168). A deeper knowledge of Hebrew thought and of the thought of Greece would therefore in the last resort mean a better understanding of our own civilisation, the civilisation which arose from the Christian message, the true synthesis of East and West. Before making a critical appraisement of the results to which this interesting enquiry has led the Author, let us follow his line of reasoning. Hebrew thought, as revealed in the structure of the Hebrew language, is dy? namic; it conceives life in all its forms as mo? vement and activity. On the contrary, Greek thought, as expressed by its highest represen? tative, Plato, is static, harmonious; true being is motionless, immutable. This same duality is found in the conception of c( word ?. The divine word, d?b?r, is for the Hebrew thought (( dynamic power ?, by which things exist; the Greek logos is essentially cc order ?. There is 369</page><page sequence="2">a difference between the Hebrews and the Greeks also in the way of cc seeing ? things. The former are not satisfied with appearances, they penetrate into the very substance of the matter; whereas the latter have, so to say, a more (( optical ? mode of perception, taking special note of shape and colors. And then as to beauty: beauty for the Hebrews consisted in attaining the purpose inherent in each thing, cc If a thing is what it ought to be, it is beauti? ful ? (p. 71); whereas for the Greeks it con? sisted in cc plastic expression, and therefore also [in] the calm, moderate and harmonious expression of the spiritual moment ? (p. 70). The conception of time differs totally in the two peoples. The Greeks have a spatial con? ception of time as a linear succession in which the present (a given point) divides the past from the future; the Hebrews on the other hand, are totally immersed in time, the whole of which they classify in two parts; that which has been (completed action), and that which has not been (uncompleted action), in the pre? sent as in the past and in the future. The conclusion to which the examination of these diversities ? we have selected only the most significant ? leads the author, is that if He? brew thought differs widely from the Greek, yet it cannot be said to be opposed to it. In? deed, the two modes of thought are comple? mentary, as are the senses of sight and hear? ing. The Greeks would represent sight, the Hebrews hearing. The complementary cha? racter of their thought is moreover fully de? monstrated by the history of our European civilisation, founded, in the author's opinion, on the speculative harmony of the Greeks and on the dynamism of the Hebrews. The study of Greek philosophy in its rela? tion to Hebrew thought is much favored by theologians, and especially by Protestants, who endeavor by this means to attain a fuller un? derstanding of the New Testament, in which, indeed, Hebrew and Greek features have deeply intermingled. An enquiry which would go beyond the limits here set, in an endeavor to find the binomial, Greece-Israel, at the basis of every spiritual expression of European ci? vilisation, is however likely to prove ground? less. One cannot but consider disconcerting the following assertion: cc We recognize that there is a Semitic element in the Renaissance, when for instance, we compare the dynamic sculpture of Michelangelo with the harmonious one of classical Greece; or the physics of Ga? lileo with those of Aristotle ? (p. 4). This 370 would imply that every feature of modern ci? vilisation, which is missing in the classical one, is exclusively due to Hebrew thought. Even if the enquiry be confined within historically justifiable limits, a comparison between two things can only be made if there be affinity between them. And this affinity does not seem to us to exist in the case studied by the Nor? wegian scholar. One of the terms of the com? parison is provided by Greek, or rather by Platonic philosophy (why not speak then of cc platonisches Denken y&gt; rather than of cc grie? chisches ??). Apart from the arbitrary selec? tion which has been made, the fact remains that we have before us one of the summits of theoretical thought, a summit reached after centuries of speculative meditation. We should therefore expect that the comparison would be made with Hebrew thought as elaborated by one, or several, or all the Biblical writers. But we are offered here nothing of the sort; only a passing reference is made to the specu? lative qualities of some Biblical writers. A single example will suffice to show the super? ficiality of such a judgment. About the book of Ecclesiastes (although it lent itself excel? lently to an analytical comparison with Greek thought) we are told: cc the Preacher too is without doubt a great thinker. No one before him had to such an extent united deep and consequential pessimism with serenity of soul and the fear of God ? (p. 162). As a matter of fact, this supposed cc union y&gt; (Vereinigung) is artificial and far-fetched, and not a few commentators of the Bible consider that the passages referring to cc the fear of God ? are interpolations due to a pious glossographer (h?sid). On the Hebrew side, the term of comparison is provided by a linguistic and sty? listic analysis of the books of the Old Testa? ment. And here let us state at once that un? satisfactory as is the first term of the com? parison (the Greek one), the second, which occupies a large part of the book, is indeed thought-provoking. It is to this latter part that the book owes its not inconsiderable va? lue; in it the Biblical scholar will find many truly valuable and often original observations. With regard to the linguistic analysis which occupies the first part of the work, one objec? tion must be made, and on account of it we cannot agree with the author. Since in its general structure the Hebrew language is, as Dr. Bom an himself recognises, closely related to that of the other Semitic tongues, the con? clusions arrived at for Hebrew thought should</page><page sequence="3">hold good for the thought of all the peoples who have expressed themselves in Semitic lan? guages. Frankly speaking, this statement would seem to us excessive, all the more so as the stylistic enquiry on the following pages is limited not only to the Hebrew language but also to the Biblical books alone. The author derives the dynamic character of Hebrew thought, of which we have already spoken, from certain grammatical features which he examines. Among them there is the nature of the so-called cc stative ? verbs (pp. 21-25) and of those verbs having a two-fold meaning, as for instance, q?m which means both 'stand' and 'rise up'. Dr. Boman deduces from this two-fold character a tendency to action which makes itself felt even when conditions are ap? parently static. This hypothesis is suggestive, but it still has to be seen if the phenomenon is not a purely grammatical one, of semantic evolution largely due to analogy. (See on this point P. Jo?ON, Grammaire de Vhebreu bi blique\ Rome, 1947, pp. 95-96). The precise nature of (( stative ? verbs seems to escape the author when, on p. 143, he derives adjectives of the type of g?d?l cc great, powerful ?, rah cc great ?, etc., from their respective verbs, when the reverse is probably true. As we have said, the part of the book deal? ing with the stylistic examination of Hebrew thought is the best contribution the author has made to Biblical studies. The lengthy analysis of the Song of Songs, the study of supposed Biblical anthropomorphism (aspects, in reality, of the dynamism of divine action), and of the manifestation of intensity, all display the author's unusual gifts of penetration, and we look forward to receiving from him a further and yet deeper examination of Biblical thought seen from the inside, through the linguistic and stylistic expressions of the several writers of the Holy Scriptures.
