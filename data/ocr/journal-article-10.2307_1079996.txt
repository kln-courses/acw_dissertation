<plain_text><page sequence="1">A summary of research on heredity and environment.-A genuine aid to a bet- ter understanding of the contribution of nature and nurture to individual dif- ferences of human beings, with special reference to psychological characteristics, is now availablei n a volume' devoted to a summary of the research studies (arti- cles and books) on heredity and environment. The author finds justification for including the material of chapter i, "Meas- urement of Intelligence," and of chapter ii, "Measurement of Personality," on the ground that methods of measuring are a prerequisite to the study of the causes of human differences. The chief values of these two chapters reside in the rec- ommended readings and bibliography of references given at the close. In chapter iii, "Definition of the Heredity-Environment Problem: The Ge- netic Basis," is presented a very sketchy statement of "A. The Science of Ge- netics, Human Heredity" and "B. Analysis of the Heredity-Environment Prob- lem." In this chapter of six pages we are reminded of the fact that the recently developed methods of the students of genetics are of little avail in the study of psychological characteristics, which are not clearly defined, and that we must limit our study to the following questions: I Gladys C. Schwesinger, Heredity and Environment: Studies in the Genesis of Psy- chological Characteristics. New York: Macmillan Co., 1933. Pp. viii+484. $4.00.</page><page sequence="2">19341 EDUCATIONAL WRITINGS 393 In respect to any given population and any given differences in environmental fac- tors: What is the central tendency (median and interquartile range) and what are the individual extremes of range for each characteristic studied? And, To what extent are variations within this range related to differences in environment? [p. 163]. The need for including in this volume the material on personality is not ap- parent since Symond's Diagnosing Personality and Conduct, an excellent sum- mary, is fairly recent. In the reviewer's estimate, Schwesinger's book will be valued most for the ma- terial summarized in chapter iv, "Studies on Genetic Factors and Stated Envi- ronmental Differences as They Affect the Development of Intelligence." Al- though the summary of the studies is fairly complete, little reference is made to influence of training on original individual differences. In the light of the extend- ed experimentation in this field, the following quotation is somewhat puzzling: "Or, in other words, an old finding (188, p. 304 ff.) has been reinforced, namely, that intensive training increases original individual differences; it does not 'even them up' " (p. 275). No doubt, the author is referring to the early work of Thorndike, but the reference number (188) at the close of the chapter is to an article entitled "Goitre in Adolescence," by P. Stocks, A. V. Stocks, and W. N. Karn. Another error of reference to the bibliography (128) occurs on page 432. The book is relatively free from typographical errors. The reviewer, although not reading for that purpose, noted the following: page 46, line 9, "hows"; page io8, line 2, "II" for "I"; page i6i, line 23, "of"; page 206, line 5 from bottom, "anthropomorphic."
