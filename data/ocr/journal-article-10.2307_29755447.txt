<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta Preliminary Report on the Second Campaign, September-December 1968 The second excavation campaign conducted by the Italian Archaeological Mission at Shahr-i Sokhta in Iranian Sist?n took place in Autumn 1968 C). Our latest research has confirmed that we are in the presence of traces of a settlement of the 3rd millennium B.C., covering an area of over 2,500 sq. km. (2). The size of the area occupied, together with the numerous elements brought to light by both this and the preceding campaign, have allowed us not only to estimate the impor? tance of Shahr-i Sokhta as a proto-urban complex but also to form the opinion that the town was, in all probability, the main centre of the whole of the Hilmand delta. An ac? curate survey of the whole region has enabled us to recognize over 40 small and medium sized settlements along the branches of the ancient delta, the R?d-i Biy?b?n, which may all be associated, on the basis of the pottery collected on the surface, with Shahr-i Sokhta. ?(*) Photographs are due to Mrs F.

(x) The second excavation campaign at Shahr-i Sokhta took place in 1968, between September 20 and December 20. Members of the Mission, under the leadership of the writer, were Mrs F. Bonardi, photographer, Mr G. Graziani, excavation assistant, Mr T. Tamagnini, surveyor and draughts? man, and Mr R. Biscione, who was in charge of pottery cataloguing. Mr Ismail Yaghmai, Inspector of the Iranian Archaeological Service, took an active part in the whole campaign, never leaving us without his aid and advice. I am particularly indebted to Prof. G. Tucci, President of IsMEO, and Dr D. Faecenna, for having first created and then constantly supported this vast plan of research into the most ancient civilization of Sist?n. I should also like to recall all those whose help has contributed to the editing of this preliminary report: my affectionate thanks go to my father, Dr L. Tosi, and also to Miss M. C. Bulgareiii and Mr M. Bonelli, co-assistants in drawing up the plates, and Mr G. Graziani, who has helped and advised me in the solution of numbers of daily problems. A final debt of gratitude is owed to Prof. V. Caroli, draughtsman, and Mr G. Silvestrini, photographer, who have always patiently carried out the many variations with which I have frequently encumbered their work. (2) M. Tosi, ?

If Egypt was, in Herodotus' phrase, the gift of the Nile, Sist?n was the gift of the Helmand ? (3). Although the flow and basin of the Hilmand cannot compete with the Indus, the Tigris and the Euphrates, it is undoubtedly the largest water-course to be found between Mesopotamia and Sindh and the region in which it has its source has the same ecological features as the great alluvial plains of Central and South-Western Asia, where, in the course of centuries, the most ancient cities of human history have arisen. Iran, from a purely climatic aspect, presents features very similar to those of Meso? potamia, but is lacking in precisely those large river basins that have permitted and fa? cilitated the encounter and merging of the most different communities (4). Here, on the contrary, the country's geographical setting is such that although there are no unsurmount able difficulties of communication between the various regions, the cultures were dis? tributed and developed in the highland valleys which, thanks to good water resources, were more fertile. On the other hand, as Iran's wealth has always been tied to her mineral resources, a strong cultural pressure was exercised by Mesopotamia, that was interested in the stones and metal in which the highland mountains abound. Thus, the civilizations developing in Mesopotamia in the course of the 4th and 3rd millennia influenced the whole of the Iranian territory to a varying degree. In Elam, the present Kh?zist?n, the progress of the more ancient tribes towards urbanization was never separated from that of southern Mesopotamia, with which it main? tained constant relations. The pre- and proto-urban settlements found up to the present time in Iran are naturally concentrated in the few regions where life is made easier by large water resources. Their distribution permits us to single out the two main ways of communication across the coun? try. The first, starting from Susa, went in a NE direction up to the Elburz Mountains and continued easterly along the southern slope of the great chain until it reached the southern steppe of Turkmenia. In this way, some of the most important centres of Iran's remotest history, such as Tepe Sialk, the Tehran valley (Chashman cAli, Ismacil?b?d, etc.), Tepe Hiss?r, Sh?h Tepe, Turang Tepe and the centres of southern Turkmenia (Anau, Na mazga, Altin Tepe) were linked up (5). The second route could have crossed the whole of the South of the country, connecting three of the most fertile regions of Iran: Elam, F?rs and Kirm?n. (3) C. E.

Exploration of the Kirm?n district has commenced only recently: an excavation at Tal-i Iblis has shown quite clearly that direct influence from Mesopotamia may even have reached as far away as this (6), while the even more recent excavation at Tepe Yahy? bears witness to the important his? torical role played by this region (7). Sist?n and the culture of Shahr-i Sokhta remain in a certain sense isolated: the great Khevlr desert separated them from the more dynamic centres recognized up to now in Iran. On the other hand, the Hilmand, with its permanent water course, facilitated to an enormous extent communications with what is now southern Afghanistan. This funda? mental geographical consideration represents a reference point that we will continue to bear in mind throughout our research. The history of Sist?n, from the times of Shahr-i Sokhta up till the present day, has been inseparable from that of the river that is its lifespring. &amp; * * The 1968 campaign was planned as a continuation of the trenches begun during the previous season (fig. 4) (8). In the point located on the south-eastern slope of the hill, the square marked with the letters RYL, trench IB was continued with slight variations and a stratigraphical se? quence down as far as the natural ground level was established. The surface excavated measures 10 X 5 m. with an E-W axis and reaches the depth of 5 m. At this depth the area decreases to 6 X 2.50 m. (figs. 5-8, 43-54). In the flat area right in the centre of the hill, the extensive excavation of a series of buildings was continued so as to bring a portion of the urban centre to light (fig. 9). The cultural sequence that has been revealed comprises three periods ? I, II and III ? starting from the bottom, each of which has been subdivided into phases on the basis of variations in plan and partial reconstruction of individual buildings. IV), Moskva, 1965; V. I.

(8) At the beginning of the second excavation campaign the surface of Shahr-d Sokhta was divided up into squares measuring 250 m. per side, each of which was then divided into squares measuring 50 m. per side and again into 10 X 10 m. squares, indicated with Roman capitals. The squares measuring 10 m. per side are thus indicated with three capital letters. 285</page><page sequence="4">TESTING TRENCH (SQUARE RYL) The most ancient period reached in the RYL trench rests on natural soil of alluvial origin into which we dug about 2 m. down in order to bring its structural characteristics to light. Terrain Geographically speaking, Sist?n is simply the delta of the Hilmand and its geological formation has consequently depended on the alternation of floods and the consequent varia? tions in the river's course. The geology of the region is characterized by an ancient sedi? mentation of clay on the bed of the whole of the H?m?n basin, whose period of greatest extension was probably reached for the last time at the end of the last glacial period, as a consequence of the melting of the glaciers that had formed over most of the Hindukush. The river bed must subsequently have settled into a wide delta with an E-W axis, known today under the name of R?d-i Biy?b?n, while the terraces constantly diminished in size, as the higher sedimentary dunes gradually emerged, and was slowly transformed into a huge marsh due to the rapid evaporation. Variations, however small, in the river's water system, thanks to the clayey, imper? meable nature of the soil, undoubtedly produced floods whose violence must have had a considerable effect on the land that emerged. As the waters withdrew, this was transformed into clayey plateaux whose surface gradually solidified partly due to the salty crust pro? duced by evaporation. The terraces thus formed were in their turn corroded by the sub? sequent floods. Some of the traces left on the soil by the retreating waters are visible on the sides of the lake even today. This continuous cycle of violent floods, widespread sedi? mentation and rapid evaporation, frequently repeated throughout the centuries, has produc? ed the characteristic landscape of Sist?n: clayey terraces that are never very high alternating with flat plains whitened by their salt content, while the deep clefts in the earth's surface and the rounded contours are an indication of the passage of the alluvial floods. The clayey nature of the soil has prevented the Hilmand from forming a permanent river bed. In fact, during the periods of drought, the load of sediment caused a continuous rise in the level of the river bed, which was consequently unable to contain the volume of the waters in times of flood. It ensued that the river tended to change course con? tinuously and this change, due to the earth's rotation, takes place in a clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere (Coriolis' law). The Hilmand has thus shifted by about 90?. Today, the ancient river bed ? the R?d-i Biy?b?n ? which had an E-W direction, is dry and the river progressively deviated until it reached its present position, with a N-S axis. The natural terrain brought to light by our stratigraphical excavation fits in fairly well with the general hydrogeological picture. At the bottom of the trench we met a layer of reddish, very compact clay, that disin? tegrates into prismatic crystals (fig. 8, ?). This type of clay is often characteristic of con 286</page><page sequence="5">stant and fairly prolonged sedimentations like those of marshes, shallow basins and still water lakes, but in our case the sediment could represent a very early terrace of the river, at a time when the lake, that is now over 30 km. away, was much closer to this area of southern Sistan. We dug about 1.80 m. down into the red clay to a point that is only a few metres above the level of the plain surrounding Shahr-i Sokhta and that appears to be of far more recent formation. The layer of clay brought to light appeared to be covered by a salt crust with an average thickness of 2-4 cm., that was only recognizable in certain points; for the most part it proved to be mixed with the clay below ?. It may be assumed that the salt was formed immediately after the withdrawal of the semipermanent waters from the zone. In the upper part of the excavation, we met a series of layers of gray sand and gravel ?a-d and chrome yellow-coloured gravel ?. These strata are not parallel to the layer of clay; they proceed in a sinuous line and appear somewhat discontinuous, often crossing one another. The origin of this formation is obviously alluvial. The sand, gravel and clay are usually deposited in successive and parallel strata since, because of their different specific weight, the sedimentation varies in relation to the speed of the carrying waters. In our case it would seem that this speed was very variable and that in consequence the waters themselves did not flow in a single direction. This would explain the formation of inter? secting strata and the almost total absence of clay strata. The flow of water must, in fact, have been practically continuous: the sand and gravel deposited by the previous floods must have been followed immediately by more gravel and sand, allowing no time for the formation of an intermediate layer of clay. This stratum of alluvial deposits provides sufficiently clear evidence of the zone's transition from the post-glacial period to an extremely variable and uncontrolled water system. Even in this case, the stratigraphical evidence seems to correspond to the hydro geological situation. Between the alluvial strata and the underlying red clay stratum, an intermediate layer about 20 cm. thick ?e has been brought to light. It is composed of clots of reddish clay, mixed with salt and gray sand, with some gravel intrusions. These are probably the remnants of the most ancient deposit of the alluvial waters, characterized by the transpor? tation of fragments of reddish clay that had been crumbled by the passing of the flood. The alluvial series of gravel and sand ends with a fairly discontinuous stratum of gray clay, with an average thickness of 15 cm., immediately beneath the beginning of the ar? chaeological deposit with the structures of Period I. Period I The wall structures of Period I are the most ancient discovered in Shahr-i Sokhta so far (figs. 5, 44, 45). The restricted surface excavated at the bottom of the trench has prevent? ed us from getting clear evidence of these structures. They comprise a series of walls that 287</page><page sequence="6">appear to be part of two or more rooms of a single building. Along the northern wall of the trench, with an E-W direction, runs a wall supporting several small walls with a N-S direction. These smaller walls, having no foundation trench, appear as minor structures, structurally linked to the main wall which, on the contrary, has a foundation trench 0.40 m. deep that is perfectly visible in the western section of the trench. The foundations of this wall were laid in the cavity and the empty space around them was filled in with earth and clay @. The bricks of which the wall is composed are laid on their cut side in two adjacent rows with their joints either staggered or in line. Foundations were probably only laid for the main walls, which had to bear the greater load, while the smaller walls, mostly com? posed of a single course of bricks laid horizontally with the long side out, were rarely sup? ported by foundations. In our case, while the long E-W wall presents a real foundation trench, the base of the abutting transverse N-S smaller wall practically corresponds to the beginning of its projection. On the eastern side of the trench, corresponding to the 1967 stratigraphic pit, we have brought a series of structures to light, among which particular mention should be made of the remains of a wall built of two adjoining courses of bricks with their long side out. Although only a few bricks are visible in these remains, it is possible to observe, in at least one point, that some of the bricks are laid in a different direction, which clearly suggests that the construction of the wall in question did not take place all at the same time. It may be supposed that there were various phases of construction and reconstruc? tion during Period I as well. Hence, it is probable that this period will eventually also have to be subdivided into phases, on the basis of more extended architectural evidence. Over the E-W wall lies a layer of gray clay containing potsherds, bones and charcoal (fig. 8, section B-C) ? and ?a. Subsequently, in a fairly friable, clayey soil, there are alter? nating narrow and widespread lenticular patches of charcoal ? and ashes ?. This stratum, that is particularly rich in material, is clearly posterior to the abandonment of the build? ing; evidently a phase in which this point of the tepe, while still frequented, was not built over. The clay stratum @ immediately above the wall could be a proof of a rapid sedi? mentation, also the consequence of an alluvial phenomenon. Period II Period II presents itself with a fairly complex structure: large foundations and a flooring composed of a veritable brick platform (fig. 6). The greater area of the surface excavated has enabled us to bring to light a unit of at least three rooms, all part of a single house. The plan of this building, however, does not appear to end with the rooms unearthed. Another wall, with an E-W direction, was built directly above the remains of the older wall, so that they are almost touching. The visible foundations of the new wall, whose 288</page><page sequence="7">cavity bores deep into stratum ?, are larger than those of the older wall: seven courses of bricks against a bare three. The strata of Period II were completely isolated from those of the preceding period by means of a floor formed by a layer of bricks, that has unfortunately not been preserved in a good condition over the whole surface of the excavation ?. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that prior to laying the flooring the underlying soil was prepared with fillings of earth, possibly containing more recent material. Two main walls, both with an E-W direction, and two other walls, orthogonal to the former in a N-S direction, enclose two symmetrical rooms, one of which was subsequently subdivided in its turn into two smaller rooms, indicated by the letters CI and CII The other room ? CIV ? in which our deeper trench was later dug, on the contrary, main? tained its plan unaltered throughout the entire period. A total of 7 superimposed floors have been detected within Period II. All of these floors, with the exception of the bottom one which, as has already been said, is composed of a brick platform, are no other than layers of clay mixed with straw, about 5 cm, thick and imperfectly levelled off. Thorough examination of the floors, walls and stratigraphy has convinced us that, with regard to this building, Period II should be subdivided into three minor phases: a, b and c. Within the area uncovered by our trench, only two rooms ? CIV and CI/CII ? and their partition wall ? which, having no foundations, is inserted between the two E-W transverse walls (fig. 46) ? belong to the most ancient of these phases, IIa. In each of these rooms we found a clay quadrangular bench-shaped hearth, with a hemispherical oven in the centre, and small raised edges (fig. 47). Normally, in this as in the other buildings brought to light, the hearths were built in the middle of the room, well away from the walls. In room CIV, the hearth found had been almost completely destroyed, so as to enable a second one (visible in the photograph) to be built in the later phase lib. Only the partial scorching of the earth and the impression left by the oven shaft permitted us to recognize the existence of the more ancient hearth. (?) For easier reference, we have decided to number the rooms in consecutive Roman numerals. The relation between the old numbers and the new ones is shown in the following table: la = III 2a = XVII lb = IV 2b = XIX lc = V 2c = XX Id = VI 3 a = XXVI le = VII 3b = LXXX If = VIII 3c = recognized as inexistent. During Period III, many rooms were divided up into lesser ones; the result is that the number of rooms tends to diminish as the exca? vation gets deeper. Thus, when we have identified a room as belonging to Period I or II, we have preferred to keep the initial number given for Period III. In this way, rooms XXI and XXII of Period III are identified with room XXI/ XXII of phases lib, lie and lid and even with room XIX/XXI/XXII of phase Ha {? room? is omitted in the captions). The excavation cuts and layers are both indicated with Arab numerals, with the difference that the latter may be identified by a circle drawn round them. S = surface (find). 289</page><page sequence="8">In room CI/CII, before its subdivision, there was an identical hearth that has been greatly damaged by the caving in of the structures above it and by rats. During the following phase IIb, the floors were raised by about 10 cm. In room CIV, the new hearth was built and the floor was broken in to make room for the construction of a small closet, about 20 cm. deep and lined by a frame of broken bricks laid with their cut sides resting on the previous floor. This small closet hole (60 X 50 cm.) contained two whole pear-shaped, Buff Ware beakers, together with the bones of a pig's shoulder, still in anatomical connexion, and about a dozen fragments of unbaked clay with stamp seal impressions (fig. 54). The pit was in its turn surrounded by a tiny wall, less than 10 cm. high, that appears to have cut off the entire south-east corner of the room. We are not al present able to give an exact explanation of the functions of either the pit or the wall. It may be interesting to note that in room XXIII, part of the ? House of the Stairs ?, a hemicyclical pit containing a group of bones in anatomical connexion, also accompanied by two whole pear-shaped beakers, has been found in a floor of Period He (fig. 55). Floor 2, contemporary with the large hearth (phase lib), was merely a readaptation of the previous floor I, on which the destroyed hearth rested (phase IIa). The distance between the two floor levels tended to decrease towards the south wall, while it reached 10 cm. against the north wall. Phase lib thus merely consists in the raising and restoring of the floors and hearths of Period Ha. Room CI/CII offers two interesting details. A squat biconical jar of the Black-to Brown on Buff Surface Ware type (figs. 246, 247), containing fragments of semi-precious stones and alabaster and tools for the working and drilling of beads, was found buried in the floor almost against the north wall. The contents of the jar will be examined in greater detail in the following chapter on the finds. In the S-W corner of the room in question, a parallelepiped-shaped container was built by laying a tiny hemispherical wall of unbaked bricks up against the west wall of the room. The container measures about 90 cm. in height, with an average width of 60 cm. A venthole built in a square pipe shape with a series of bricks set in the form of an angle was applied on top of the container, towards the north side. This was probably a tank for the preservation of material whose nature we are unable to specify. However, this tiny tank must still have been in use in the following phase He, since the partition wall that was set up to divide room CI/CII was built in such a way as would not obstruct the venthole (fig. 52). Between floor 2 of phase lib and floor 3 of phase lie, we found a filling, probably artificial, with an average height of 30 cm., composed for the most part of bricks and a large amount of pottery. The large central hearth in room CIV was also completely covered over during phase lie, and rooms CI and CII were formed by means of a partition wall (fig. 49). Access to room CII was ensured by a doorway opened up in the eastern wall. Hearths belonging to this phase have not as yet been discovered. 290</page><page sequence="9">In room CHI, only a very limited part of which has been excavated, a small rectan? gular basin of unbaked clay, measuring 80 X 50 X 15 cm., was unearthed against the room's north wall. It appears as a small depression in the floor level. The structures of Period II end with this phase. A few metres further south, in square RYG, one of the gullies formed by the action of the rain water draining away has brought to light several walls that almost certainly belong to this period (fig. 6). The strata belonging to the period under examination appear as a sequence of floors and fillings, but it is probable that there were also traces of alluvial phenomena between phases lib and lie, as the presence of a very clayey stratum, almost completely covering the floors and walls of this period, would suggest. Period III The next period, III, is the one best-known so far, thanks to the relatively large area of the surface excavated (fig. 7). At least two adjoining buildings, neither of which has appeared in all its interest in the area excavated, can be distinguished in the plan of the structures brought to light. Unfortunately, all the structures belonging to this period have been considerably damaged by erosion. In particular, the water running along the walls has corroded them to such an extent that the filling materials contained in each room have been washed away. In our stratigraphical section, between the strata and floors of Periods II and III, there is a series of fillings about 1 m. high in some points, that are very rich in potsherds. Mo? reover, not all the walls of Period II were covered by the filling. The eastern wall of rooms CI and CII, in particular, was used as a foundation for a wall of the following period. Along the section, the protruding part of this N-S wall appears to be intercepted in two points (this detail is visible when the sections of the north and south walls are studied together) (fig. 48). These variations in its coarse, combined with the reciprocal superposi? tion of the walls leaning against it, have enabled us to subdivide Period II into three successive phases. The extremely poor state of preservation of the structures and strata unfortunately renders recognition of the phases highly problematical. Moreover, the walls of the most ancient phase (III a) had already in their time been reduced in height, and in some cases completely destroyed, to make room for the later ones. In the course of the 1968 campaign, the excavation was extended southwards by another 5 m., thus permitting a whole series of rooms to be brought to light, that may be attributed to phase Ilia and Illb. These rooms have been distinguished with numbers C, CV, CVI and CVII. The excavation of room C, which is roughly square-shaped (2.30 X 2 m.), consti? tutes a point of comparison with the data obtained from the sections (fig. 50). Two suc? cessive phases have been recognized. In the lower one (Ilia), there is a clay hearth, with a quadrangular bench shape and a hemispherical oven in the middle; the doorway into the 291</page><page sequence="10">loom opens onto the north side. In the following phase (IIIb), the floor was raised by the usual heap of bricks and potsherds; the doorway was sealed up with a brick curtain and a new hearth, of the same type as the previous one, was set up against it. The northern doorway, slightly out of line with the previous one, was probably still used for access into the room. In the adjacent room, CVI, which has a rectangular shape (4.50 X 1.50 m.) we have recognized a floor belonging to phase Illb, with a hearth similar to the one described above (fig. 51); the doorway was probably set in the south wall. Above the phase Illb floor, the remains of a collapsed wall, with the courses of bricks still in parallel alignment, could be distinguished. Finally, in room CV, the remains of a stairway of unbaked brick, up against the western wall, were identified. All that remains of it are three steps in a poor state of preservation (fig. 53). Phase I lie was recognized in 1967 in the excavation of square RYM. As the soil in that point had been less worn down by erosion, several small walls, no higher than 30 cm., a portion of flooring and a small rectangular basin had been preserved just below the surface of the present level of the site. It should however be made clear that our division into phases, especially with regard to Period III, is strictly connected with the structures excavated in this sector. In the complex life of a large centre of the size of Shahr-i Sokhta, individual houses or entire districts had continually to be restored, rebuilt and enlarged, without causing any radical transformation to the city's basic layout. While the periods singled out by us probably cor? respond to three distinguishable moments in Shahr-i Sokhta's evolution, their subdivision into phases and possible subphases remains an isolated fact whose application will be based specifically on the recognition of restorations of the individual urban units that we will gradually bring to light. In conclusion, we can affirm that from the evidence produced by the excavation of trench RYL, starting from the natural ground level of alluvial origin, three periods may be distinguished, each one of them presenting numerous signs of restoration and rebuilding, which permit us to proceed to a subdivision into minor phases. Moreover, there is no clear-cut division between Periods I-IIL This fact is particularly worth emphasizing, since, on the basis of the stratigraphical evidence and the examination of the finds, it will enable us to recognize a cultural continuity in the historical reconstruction of the major proto-urban centre of Slst?n. THE EXTENSIVE EXCAVATION The extensive excavation conducted in sectors XCD-XIJ, has unearthed a fairly sizeable portion of the city's layout, in an area that has suffered relatively little from rain erosion (fig. 4). The area has the aspect of a small rectangular basin, 50 m. long by at least 40 m. 292</page><page sequence="11">On the south and north sides, the basin is bordered by two small ridges, where the ground covers wall structures in a good state of preservation. During the present campaign, the excavation has been extended so as to include the northern ridge as well (figs. 9, 56). The ? House of the Stairs ? Undoubtedly, the most significant achievement of the 1968 campaign has been the complete excavation of a house (fig. 10) that may be attributed to Periods II and III (10). The house (figs. 57-59), spreading over squares XIB, XIC, XIG and XIH, is oriented in a N-S direction and occupies the NE corner of the insula (X1). This building has not only permitted us to collect an abundant series of urban and architectural data, but also to realize the importance of the artificial fillings of the rooms, which probably are a fundamental element in determining the chronological sequence of the entire settlement. These fillings were the means adopted to raise the level of the houses, following the progressive rise in the street level. The slow but constant accumulation of urban refuse and wind-borne dust, or, more frequently, the violent floods of the Hilmand, in fact, produced such a mass of debris that the inhabitants were obliged to raise the level of their houses in proportion. A similar phenomenon has been widely observed in the excavations of all the centres located in the great alluvial plains of central Western Asia. But the nature of the fillings used in Shahr-i Sokhta renders them particularly interesting. They were in fact formed of more or less broken pieces of bricks, earth, bones and pottery and were often composed of veritable dumps of pottery (figs. 60-63). It was precisely this unusual expedient adopted by the inhabitants of Sis tan that deceived A. Stein and other observers. Combined erosion by wind and rain throughout the centuries has caused the destruction of the rooms and the dispersal of much of the pottery filling. The entire hill, despite its con? siderable size, is thus covered by a thick layer of pottery, whether consisting in whole vessels or potsherds. It ensued that anyone who had had the occasion to see this vessel ? graveyard ? might easily have concluded that the entire archaeological deposit, violently attacked by wind and floods, had been dispersed, leaving only a few traces of the wall structures and their stratigraphical sequence. On the other hand, another phenomenon, typical of regions with a sub-tropical cli? mate, has opposed the wind's erosive action: the evaporation of the water and the con? sequent formation of salt. Throughout Sist?n the rapid evaporation facilitates the forma (10) Tosi, op. cit., pp. 17-20. i11) I should like, at this point, to thank my assistant Mr G. Graziani, who practically directed the excavation of the ? House of the Stairs ? and adjacent buildings and contributed to the photo graphic documentation. Much of the success of this delicate section of research is due to his constant cooperation and to that of Mr T. Tama gnini, the surveyor. 293</page><page sequence="12">tion of salt to such a degree that modern agriculture is confronted by considerable difficulty for the survival of many crops (12). At Shahr-i Sokhta, today too far from the irrigated areas to interest modern farmers, a crust of salt, too thick to be corroded by th e wind or scanty rain-water, has gradually been formed, practically undisturbed. Beneath a very friable surface stratum formed by the wind, one normally encounters a layer of salt that has hardened to such a degree that it can often only be removed with a pickaxe. The salt accumulated on the walls has solidified the paste of the unbaked bricks and prevented infiltration of humidity from removing the plaster. The salt crust has also served as an excellent protection for much of the decom? posable substances contained in the fillings. In this manner, bones, dyes, wood, ropes and fabrics have been able to reach us and will soon make it possible for us to make a better reconstruction both of the ecological background of the city's life and of certain aspects of its material culture, such as weaving and wood-working, which normally remain obscure. In the house excavated this year, we have distinguished four phases in Period II, each characterized by the raising of the floor level and variations in the plan (figs. 11-14). In Period III then, the plan underwent considerable changes, in the sense that nearly all the rooms were divided by partitions (fig. 15). These later structures have unfortunately been greatly reduced by erosion and lie immediately below the present level of the site (fig. 69). We shall now examine the process adopted in the fillings and subsequent alterations to the plan. This sequence of phases will not be associated with the general chronology of Shahr-i Sokhta since it should be considered that the changes in question involve a single building or district and thus cannot represent a term of reference for the urban development of the whole town. The house's original layout (fig. 11) lies directly upon a series of walls that, on the basis of the pottery finds, may be linked to Period I of trench RYL (figs. 66-68). A small testing pit in the SE corner of room XIX demonstrates clearly how the original foundation cavity cut down into the stratified clayey deposit that may be associated with these more ancient walls, oriented in a different direction from that of the later ones (fig. 16). The more ancient plan ? phase IIa ? was almost square-shaped (20 X 23 m.) and subdivided into four symmetrical rooms created by the crosswise arrangement of the partition walls (fig. 11). The floor relating to this first phase has only been brought to light in room XX and in the adjacent room XIX/XXI/XXII. The doorway was on the north side, giving out onto the street that marked the northern boundary of the whole insula. All the door (12) An exhaustive documentation on the problem of salinity in Sistan, both from the geological and the more directly hydrological aspect, has been published by the firm Italconsult, at the end of a long and thorough research on the region's ecology for account of the Plan Organization of Iran (Economic and Social De? velopment Plan for the South-Eastern Region).

(fig. 70). The architrave was formed by a transverse wooden beam supported by the doorposts and housed inside a bloock of clay (figs. 70, 71): a simple and ingenious device that was widely used in the city. In phase lib the doorstep was instead composed of two bricks laid with their long side out, jutting out slightly from the line of the wall (fig. 72). During this first phase, room XX communicated on its western side with room XVII, which, in its turn, gave out onto the street (fig. 64); on its south side, on the contrary, it communicated with room XIX/XXI/XXII, whence, through a doorway on its west side, one passed into room XVIII. On the NW and SE corners of the floor in room XX were installed two hemispherical ovens made of unbaked brick (figs. 82, 83). The adjacent room ? XIX/XXI/XXII ? pre? sented a quadrangular bench-shaped hearth with a hemispherical oven in the middle and raised edges, slightly removed from the eastern wall; a second hearth of the same type was installed against the western wall, almost on a line with one side of the door leading into room XVIII (fig. 75). Finally, in a central position, a small, almost oval basin (60X30 cm.), whose use is still unknown, had been built (fig. 11). In the course of the first rebuilding process ? phase lib ? this plan underwent several slight modifications (fig. 12). First of all, the floor level was raised by about 10/15 cm. by means of a layer of potsherds immediately above which the new floor was placed (fig. 62). In room XVIII, we removed the raw clay crust of the later flooring so as to be able to see the nature of the underlying filling (fig. 72; fig. 17, cuts 10-12). The rise in the floor level obliged the inhabitants to alter the height of the doors so that ac? cess from one room to the other would not be too difficult. In this way, the threshold of the door between rooms XVIII and XIX was raised by four superimposed courses of bricks and the architrave was raised by at least 20 cm. (fig. 70). The door leading into room XX was also altered in the same way. Room XIX/XXI/XXII was subdivided into two lesser rooms with the erection of a partition wall ? oriented NS ? in which a door was opened up. While all the other walls in the house had been built with two adjoining rows of bricks laid with their long sides out, this partition was built with a single course of bricks not constituting a load bearing structure. As however the partition wall proved in this way to be insecure, in order to ensure its solidity, three supporting pilasters, each composed of a column of superim? posed unbaked bricks, were set up 1.40 m. away from one another; two of these pilasters were set up in the corners formed by the wall with the north and south walls; the third was placed in the middle. The expedient must have worked since, in the following phase, when the walls were raised again, the three supports were brought to the new height without any alteration to their position (fig. 77). The two rooms formed by the erection of the partition wall differ slightly in size: room XIX measuring 3.50 X 2 m., and room XXI/XXII, 3.50 X 3 m. The latter has a 295</page><page sequence="14">particular interest for us, in that it constitutes the stratigraphical guide to the entire build? ing. At every new rise in the room's floor level (fig. 76) ? and hence at every new phase ? another hearth was laid immediately over the previous one. In this way, at the end of our excavation, we had a veritable column of 4 superimposed hearths in the centre of the room, without considering at least 7 floors that adjoined them (fig. 78). While in the other rooms the different phases are not as clearly evident, in room XXI/XXII they may not only be recognized in every hearth and probably dated by the use of Radiocarbon, but it is probably also possible to establish the sequence of the floors, some of which are un? doubtedly mere seasonal restorations that only concern this particular room. One of these, together with the hearth of the phase in question (lib), presents clear traces of sheep dung (fig. 79). The old hearth of phase IIa was thus covered by the new floor and replaced by another hearth of the same type, almost identical in shape. The small basin and hearth in room XIX were also covered by the new floor (visible in fig. 66). In the north-western corner of the same room we have unearthed several small walls, whose function, however, we are not yet able to explain. The changes in room XX were more substantial: a small staircase, whose steps were composed of a row of bricks with their long side out, was built in the NE corner. The staircase was incorporated by a little wall that separated it from the rest of the room (figs. 73, 82). A low rectangular opening had been made in the wall, in correspondence with the bottom of the stairs (figs. 80, 81). The staircase probably led to a roof-terrace, since the average thickness of the outer walls does not permit the hypothesis of the existence of an upper storey. We can only suppose that the wall round the stairs was built in order to provide another support for the ends of the wooden logs supporting the roof. In this way the staircase, isolated from the rest of the room, could remain exposed, thus making access to the terrace much easier. A small rectangular niche in the north wall, between the stairway and the door lead? ing in from outside, also belongs to this phase, if not even to the previous one. This niche, created by the removal of two or three bricks and a mere 30 cm. above the floor, was partly lined with wooden laths still in a good state of preservation (fig. 84, low down in the middle). With the laying of the new floor, the two hemispherical ovens were de? stroyed (fig. 73): a new one was built to replace them in the SW corner of room XVIII (fig. 83). This specimen, that has been better preserved, has provided us with most of our data on this type of oven, data that has been gathered together in the chapter concerning the minor structures. In the present chapter we will, however, examine the way they were installed in this room. The bottom of the oven rests directly on the floor and the bricks composing its left side were made to adhere to the south wall. The back of the oven, which has an approxi? mately semicircular form, on the contrary, does not rest against the eastern wall but is about 3 cm. removed from it; the gap is filled with potsherds. This may have been a technical 296</page><page sequence="15">device intended to prevent the heat of the oven, that is particularly violent at the back, from burning the wall, as it might were it in direct contact with it. It was during phase lie, the third in its history, that the house underwent its most radical transformation (fig. 13). On the east side and part of the south side, two new wings comprising a total of 9 rooms were built, while the plan of the original building remained unaltered. The floor level was raised by over 1 m. and the doors had conse? quently to be adapted to the new height and the hearths once again replaced. The structures added on to the original plan consist in a series of four main, intercom? municating rooms, stretching along the eastern side, and a large room, along the southern side, subdivided in its turn into 4 small-sized rooms. The two parts of the house ? the original part and the phase lie addition ? were connected by a rectangular doorway opening on the eastern wall of room XXI/XXII. This doorway led into a small-sized room (3 X 2 m.) ? classified as no. XXIII ? which gave access on its south side to room XLVIId and the southern wing, an on its north side to rooms XXIV and XXV (fig. 85). Another doorway opening on the east wall of room XXIV, led into a long, narrow room (4 X 1 m.) containing a staircase composed of 10 steps (LXX), another access to the roof-terrace, parallel to the one in room XX (fig. 86). Room XXIII, the first to be met on coming from the older part of the house, must probably have been a passageway, considering its restricted size and lack of a hearth. In fact, in the following phase (lid), a small flight of three steps (fig. 87) was set up against its eastern wall. Access between rooms XXIII and XXIV is ensured by two doors, opening one in front of the other 1 m. apart, so as to form a small corridor (fig. 88). Beside the passage is a tiny room, 1.50 X 1 m. in size (XXIVa), that reduces the size of room XXIV by a third. Apart from this little passageway and the corner room described above, room XXIV presents the following noteworthy features: a central clay hearth, of the usual square variety with hemispherical oven; the staircase (LXX), that practically constitutes an ? annexe ? to the room; and finally a wooden hinge, hollow in the centre and attached to the floor with a clay frame, that keeps it completely adhering to the ground (fig. 89). Room XXV, measuring 3 X 2.80 m., was heated in this phase by a square hearth placed in a central position, slightly removed from the western wall (fig. 90). The southern wall of room XXIII contains another door leading into a narrow rectan? gular room (2.80 X 1.20 m.) also heated by a square hearth installed in the south-eastern corner. Another two doors in room XLVII d ? one on the southern side, the other on the western side ? give access to the group of four small rooms contained in room XLVII; these were probably used as closets or stores rather than living rooms. The group of rooms XXIV and XXV, together with the staircase room LXX, almost seem to constitute an independent annexe within the building under examination. An inde? pendent access to the roof-terrace, a complex room communicating with the rest of the 297</page><page sequence="16">house, a small store (XXIVa): all this plausibly suggests that family groups linked by ties of blood or clan were living together, but in rational isolation, in the building. If we consider as well the logical separation of the probable store-rooms from the rest of the house, we realize that the building was not only extended, but also more rationally articulated, during phase lie. It seems evident that the prehistoric community living here must have possessed a considerable supply of technical knowhow and a complex social organization as well as a remarkable amount of wealth at its disposal. We shall now turn our attention to the original part of the house to see what changes it underwent during this third phase. As has already been mentioned, the plan of the building remained substantially the same, but the need to raise the floor level by over I m. made a whole series of adaptations to the door, wall and stair structures necessary. The fillings of this phase are undoubtedly the most spectacular and have furnished the greatest amount of pottery (figs. 61, 65). Over 3000 sherds per square m. have been counted in room XVIII, while the excavation of all five rooms has unearthed hundreds of intact vessels that will make it possible for us to apply the systems of analytical typology to the study of the Shahr-i Sokhta pottery. Numerous devices were used in arranging the vessels and larger fragments so as to make them occupy as much space as possible. Still in room XVIII, we were able to observe the special arrangement of numbers of ogival jars, overturned and laid one beside the other fig. 61). The raising of the floors made it necessary to wall in many of the doors used in the previous phase and open up new ones. The doors were sealed up, either totally or in part, with brickwork that was later covered with plaster so that the wall showed no traces of the old door. In room XX, the door leading out onto the street was sealed up with a large ovoid jar of the Plain Buff Ware type, set in with partial brickwork (fig. 84). The door between rooms XVIII and XIX was also walled in, but a small rectangular window was left at the top (fig. 91), while the doors between rooms XIX and XXI/XXII (fig. 92), XXI/XXII and XX (fig. 74), and XX and XVII were lifted by raising the thresholds and architraves by at least 80 cm. The door leading out onto the street from room XVII was sealed up once and for all and another one was opened up in XX, still on the north wall and practically forming an angle with the door leading to the stairs. The staircase also had to be adapted: the door leading to it was raised and the three lower steps, that were now situated below the floor, were covered. In the NW corner of room XIX, a new square hearth was built against the western wall and the oven in room XVIII disappeared. After the door between rooms XVIII and XIX had been closed, another was probably opened between XVIII and XVII, but the erosion of a gully has removed part of the partition wall, so that we cannot state this with absolute confidence. In room XXI/XXII, a third hearth (50 X 50 cm.), of excellent quality and with the usual square shape, was built on top of the old series. 298</page><page sequence="17">In conclusion, the structure of phase lie appears to be characterized by the attempt to reconstruct and adapt the more ancient nucleus, and by the enlargement of the building itself. We have before us the evidence of the wealth and prosperity of an unknown pro tohistoric family. Further research will enable us to establish whether or not this cor? responds to a moment of prosperity enjoyed by the whole town. The fourth phase ? lid ? is the last of the phases we have decided to connect with the second period of life in Shahr-i Sokhta (fig. 14). Compared with phase II c the changes are minimal: variations in the floor level range from 20 cm. in rooms XVII, XXIII and XLVIId to 35 cm. in rooms XXIV and XXI/XXII. All the doorways of the previous phase, with suitable adaptations, remain in use, with the sole exception of the two doors linking room XLVIId with XXIII and XLVIIb respectively (fig. 93). The space occupied by the door leading into room XXIII, which had been sealed up, was used for another hemispherical oven, visible on the righthand side of the photograph. In room XXIII, as has already been mentioned, a small staircase composed of three steps was built against the eastern wall (fig. 87). It may be presumed that it was built as a substitute for the one contained in stair-hole LXX, since the door between room XXIV and the latter may have been walled in towards the end of phase lie. From the deforma? tions encountered in the wall and doorway, it may be supposed that as the eastern wall of room XXIV had become insecure, it had been strengthened by sealing up the door and filling in the stair-hole. Hence the need to build a small staircase as a substitute for the previous one. The floors were raised, both in room XXIV and in room XXV, and two new hearths were installed. In room XXV, the hearth was built up against the eastern wall, unlike the previous one, that had been laid against the western wall (fig. 90). In room XXI/XXII, we find the last of the long series of hearths beginning with phase Ha. It is also square but differs from the others in its reduced size (40 X 40 cm.) and the depth of the oven, of over 30 cm. The form of the hearth is very similar to a cube. An interesting detail should be noted with regard to room XVII. Four wooden beams cut into logs were found in the filling immediately underlying the floor of this phase (fig. 64). They were evidently cut across their ends and in several intermediate points when they were placed on top of the filling. Their position shows clearly that they are not in their original context, but must have been placed here as part of the artificial filling. The floor belonging to phase lid was laid immediately above the logs, with a square hearth in the middle of the room (fig. 94). Phase lid terminates with a complete rearrangement of the house: all the rooms were filled up and the plan entirely altered (fig. 15). Generally speaking, the new plan, that we have provisionally attributed to Period III, appears to be less regular than the previous one. The doors were all walled in; often with brickwork, but sometimes with a disorderly heap of bricks, as in the case of the small closet XXIVa (fig. 88, on the left in the pho 299</page><page sequence="18">tograph). The sealing up of the doorways was undoubtedly aimed at ensuring greater sta? bility for the walls, that were employed as foundations to support the new structures. The size of nearly all the rooms was reduced by the erection of partitions: XXI/XXII was divided into rooms XXI and XXII; a group of two minute rooms (1 X 1 m.) was built in the doorway between XX and XVII (fig. 96); the stores were further restricted by the construction of two small transverse N-S walls (fig. 97), and large storage-jars were often employed to strengthen the new foundations (fig. 95). The lack of any real structures that may be attributed to this period, due to the ad? vanced state of deterioration, has prevented us from reconstructing the aspect assumed dur? ing Period III by the building called, for easier reference, the ? House of the Stairs ?, with any certainty. Our study of the house has enabled us to distinguish, in the development of a single building, temporarily isolated from its urban context, a sequence of four successive phases ? a, b, c and d ? in which the first two are separated from the last two by a large filling; moreover, the separation is rendered even more obvious by the widening of the plan and a more rational distribution of the rooms. The building was later completely readapted to suit new conditions, which, on the basis of several of the elements encoun? tered, lead us to suppose that the community settled in Shahr-i Sokhta may have passed through a period of crisis. The general picture obtained however, is that of an extremely vital community, abun? dantly endowed with means and technical knowhow and perfectly able to adapt itself to the conditions imposed by its surroundings. Other Structures Brought to Light At the end of the excavation, we were able to subdivide the area brought to light into three separate parts, practically corresponding to the plan of two roads that separated the blocks of houses from each other and formed a rectangular insula in the southern half. The lanes, with an average width of 3.50 m., had no roadbed and their route is marked by the rooms giving onto them. In the central part of the excavation, a series of wall structures, containing at least 17 rooms, each measuring less than 4 sq. m. in area, was brought to light. Up to now we have only unearthed structures belonging to the most recent period (III). Only when we have deepened the dig, so as to establish the plan of Period II, will we be able to understand and evaluate, even from the functional aspect, the alterations made to the plans in Period III, whose structures, owing to massive erosion, seem today to be fairly disor ganical. Finally, the northern part, in correspondence with the top and slopes of the small ridge, is characterized by a group of rooms in a fine state of preservation, two of which (LVIII and XLIX) have been excavated down to the bottom of the intermediate period (II). The insula, which was detected on one side of the two streets, has an area of about 500 sq. m. and contains at least four separate buildings. One of these, the ? House of the 300</page><page sequence="19">Stairs ?, has been excavated in its entirety right down to the foundation cavity. We have already described this building, isolated from its urban context, since, for the time being, it supplies the points of comparison for possible chronological relations. On the south side of this building rises a second building with a rectangular plan that probably represents the SE corner of the insula. The plan of this building in Period II seems to be composed of nine rooms with areas varying from 3 to 5 sq. m. In the following Period, III, the central room was divided up into at least three lesser rooms by the erection of small walls. In this building, where the dig reached an average depth of 40 cm., the situation appears partly similar to that of the ? House of the Stairs ?: artificial fillings, and raised walls. An interesting detail, connected precisely with the plan variations that were made in the various phases, has been revealed by the excavation of room XIII (fig. 98). Here we dug down until the whole of the floor, that can be attributed to a time connected with phase lie in the ? House of the Stairs ?, had been unearthed and we were able to observe that the pre-existing walls (Period I?) had been cut down and employed as foundations for those of the following phase or period, and that the northern and southern walls appeared wider than those of the previous period and formed a jut of about 15 cm. (fig. 99). This build? ing technique has also been noted elsewhere, and in particular in room III of an adjacent building. The excavation of room XIII has enabled us to observe several functional structures: a square, bench-shaped, clay hearth, with a hemispherical oven in the middle, was found intersected in the eastern wall ? this obviously means that the room had been divided up later on; a base for grinding stone, with its collection sill, came to light resting against the western wall; parallel to the south wall runs a small wall ? interrupted for 50 cm. ? enclosing a rectangular space 60 cm. wide (possibly a small store to be associated with the presence of the grindstone). The small room L, that is evidently part of the same building, has been excavated very briefly and reveals a filling corresponding to the type used in Period III. This filling deserves special mention since it was formed by a whole Plain Buff Ware barrel, 1.50 m. high, that had been overturned and broken, probably with the aim of making the top of the actual filling more solid and level (fig. 100). The entire western side of the insula is in a very bad state of preservation due to a neighbouring gully that has washed away most of the rooms, making recognition of the buildings difficult. In the rectangular room ? probably attributable to the Period III of an adjacent building on the western side of the ? House of the Stairs ? ? a hemicyclical furnace up against the west wall has been recognized, despite erosion. On the basis of the general topographical evidence, it is probable that the rectangular shape of the insula was only completed in phase lie, that is, when the ? House of the Stairs ? was extended by the addition of the stores on the southern wing and when a hemicyclical furnace was built in room IL (over a phase lie floor). We presume that the two buildings were separated by a lane about 4 m. wide, during phases Ha and lib. 301</page><page sequence="20">The insula would thus appear to have been produced by changes in plan that occurred dur? ing phase He. Further excavation will clarify the function of these variations within Shahr-i Sokhta's urban plan. Along the northern side of the ? House of the Stairs ? runs the E-W lane, on which the entry into the house itself gave out. The direction of the lane was connected with the changes that occurred in the buildings that gave onto it: thus, when the new eastern wing of the ? House of the Stairs ? was added in phase lie, room XXV was not built in line with XX's outer wall, but jutted out by about 40 cm. (fig. 69). During the 1968 campaign the group of rooms immediately overlooking the northern side of the street was not excavated; we limited ourselves to extending the excavation eastwards and bringing the tops of the walls to light, without proceeding to empty the rooms. For a description of these structures, the reader should thus refer to the prelimi? nary Report on the previous campaign. We preferred, on the contrary, to work on the last strip of land included in the area chosen for the dig. Here we brought to light a group of rooms in a fine state of preser? vation, that we will describe individually. Their mutual relations and the singling out of the buildings to which they belong will be one of the main objects of our future research. Room LXIX constitutes another particularly interesting find among those made during this excavation; especially as regards its exceptional state of preservation, due to favourable dry weather conditions and the consequent formation of salt (fig. 18). The room evidently belongs to Period II, although it is higher than the floor levels of contemporary buildings found further south. In all probability, the surface of the urban area cannot have been entirely level, but must have presented small differences in height, since the reconstruction and raising of the buildings did not happen at the same time over all the city area, nor with the same intensity. This is another of our reasons for considering the subdivision into phases used for the ? House of the Stairs ? as temporary and for deeming it necessary to vary the subdivision from building to building. Room LXIX, which has a rectangular layout (4.20 X 3 m.), has two doors: one on the west side, the other on the south side; while a quadrangular window (40 X 30 cm.) opens in the centre of the eastern wall. The room is in an excellent state of preservation from the ceiling down to the floor. The six E-W transverse beams supporting the clay-and matting ceiling were found carbonized while still in position (figs. 101, 102). They were probably tamerisk trunks and, while some of them were lying broken in the filling, others, beside the walls, were merely bent: fragments of matting or braided reeds are still stuck to parts of their surface (fig. 103). All the room's filling, its pottery and all the other finds have been blackened by the extremely high percentage of ash contained in the ground itself. The floor, which appeared in an excellent state of preservation, is made of beaten clay. In the centre of the room is a square bench-shaped hearth with a hemispherical oven. 302</page><page sequence="21">Near the north wall there are traces of a second hearth, that was probably destroyed in ancient times, since the bench is cut at the base and there are merely traces of the hemi? spherical oven embedded in the floor. Carbonized remains of wooden beams have been found in nearly all the rooms, as well as on the top and slopes of the little ridge. Another rectangular room (LVIII) was located practically against the east wall of room LIX, and has been excavated down as far as the oldest floor level. We reached down below the floor level of room LXIX, bringing to light a group of structures that were slightly out of line with those above (figs. 104, 105). Room LVIII measures 3.50 X 2.20 m. and had two doorways, that were subse? quently walled in, opening one on the north and the other on the west. There were no hearths or other minor structures. The southern wall must have undergone violent outside pressure as it is bent deeply towards the centre of the room; this could be the consequence of an earthquake, even after the city had been abandoned. However, in spite of this bend, the wall has preserved all its plaster. The partial scorching of the wall has moreover pre? served in some points the braided matting that was placed under the clay plaster, probably as a protection against damp. At the basis of the fillings, near the SW corner, the bottoms of two enormous barrels, arranged so as to occupy as much space in the filling as possible, have been brought to light. Numerous finds of great cultural importance were made in room LVIII. Room XL has provided us with an enormous quantity of intact beakers and small jars, that had been heaped together with a filling prior to Period III. The room in question has a rectangular layout (3 X 2 m.) and a doorway on the north side that was later sealed up. In keeping with the normal custom, it was heated by a rectangular bench-shaped hearth in the centre of the room. Up against the north wall, beside the door, we found a base for a grinding stone, built in unbaked clay bricks, which differs from the one found in room XIII in that it is lacking the collecting sill attached to the sloping floor that charac? terized the grind-stone described above (fig. 106). As to the other rooms distinguished in this site, which offer no elements of any par? ticular interest, we will limit ourselves to merely publishing their general planimetry (fig. 9). The reader is invited to refer to this, as a description would add nothing to what is revealed by the plan itself. Notes on the Architectural Structures We will now take into more detailed consideration some of the architectural features of the structures unearthed so far in Shahr-i Sokhta. All the walls found were composed of unbaked bricks laid horizontally with their long side out (fig. 107). The width of the walls is usually that of two adjoining courses of bricks; in the case of the partition walls, that were not load-bearing, a single row was suf? ficient and was often, as in the case of room XIX, reinforced with brick pilasters set against 303</page><page sequence="22">the wall at regular intervals. Only some of the buildings' outside main walls were built with three or even four parallel rows of bricks. The size of the bricks varies considerably: most of them, however, appear to have a standard size corresponding to 40 X 20 X 10 cm., in a constant ratio of 4 : 2 : 1 (13). In many cases, irregular bricks ranging in size from 40 X 40 X 10 cm. to 20 x 20 x 10 cm. were employed. The walls were built by laying the rows of bricks so that their joints were regularly staggered. The sides of the doors and windows were built with suitably broken bricks; the same system has also been observed in walls, where the use of irregular bricks produced variations in the regularity of the staggering. In room LXX, at the foot of the stairs, was unearthed the only baked brick discov? ered up to now in Shahr-i Sokhta (fig. 109). The brick was obviously baked in a kiln and measures 30 X 20 X 10 cm., which makes it approach a constant of 1 : 2 : 3 (14). We cannot, for the time being, on the ground of this single brick, that is not attributable to any wall structure, affirm that there were whole buildings made up with baked bricks. The foundations of the walls were set between trenches whose depth ranged between 30 cm. and 1 m.; the cavity was subsequently filled in with earth and large fragments of bricks. In some cases it was observed that the bottom of the foundations rested on a layer of potsherds. This was evidently a technical expedient aimed at avoiding the disintegration of the unbaked bricks due to the dampness of the soil. The potsherds thus created a series of little intervals isolating the bricks from the underlying humidity and ensuring a more solid foundation. This expedient has been called ? drainage level ?, and up to now has only been noted in structures belonging to Period III (fig. 108). Pottery was probably also widely used as a filling between floors, in that it absorbed overhead humidity better than clay and at the same time isolated the damp below. In any case, potsherds were unquestionably a widely available insulating substance that was also simple to install. The fillings were thus not only an expedient for raising the floors, but also a fairly effective insulator. Once erected, the walls were covered with a plaster consisting in a paste of clay and straw that was fairly rich in calcareous substances. The plaster was evenly applied not only to the walls but also inside doorways, windows and recesses. In some cases its ad? hesion to the wall was made easier by the use of matting. All the plaster in room LVIII was in fact put on over a mat of braided reeds. This device probably also prevented the plaster from being removed from the surface of the wall by the infiltration of damp. The (13) The unbaked clay bricks from the Harapp? Culture levels at Kalibangan also present the constant 1:2:4, as opposed to the pre-Harapp? bricks, whose constant appears to have been 1:2:3. I A, 1963-64, p. 31; ibid., 1967-68, p. 44. B. B.

In the rooms brought to light, the plaster is a gray-black colour and does not appear to have been decorated in any way. Two different types of flooring have been distinguished in the rooms. The most com? monly used variety was made in the same way as the plaster, with the application of a layer of clay and straw, with an average width of about 5 cm., to the whole room. These floors were fairly delicate and did not last long. The case of several floors of this type being placed on top of one another is frequent. A different flooring system was noted in room CIV and in part of room XXI. Greater solidity and elasticity were provided by a platform of abutting bricks ? covered by a floor of the simpler type ?a (fig. 5). The exceptional preservation of room LXIX has permitted us to make a complete examination of all the characteristics of a model room, and in particular of its roof (fig. 18). The roofing was provided with six parallel beams resting on the E and W sides of the room (figs. 101-103). The beams were fixed into slots in the wall so as to be more stable. Placed immediately above them were branches and trunks, on which the braided rush matting rested directly. A layer of clay and straw about 20 cm. deep was spread over everything so as to make the roof more solid. Roofing of this type is still used today in Sist?n and the surround? ing regions. The doorways in the ? House of the Stairs ?, that have been unearthed in a perfect state of preservation, can serve as a prototype of all the other doorways discovered in Shahr-i Sokhta up to now. The threshold was sometimes composed of two or four jutting bricks, laid immediately above the floor, but more often was missing altogether. The arch was formed by a wooden stick embedded in a block of clay, with its ends touching the doorposts, on which the bricks of the wall above rested. In room XXIV, at the bottom of the door communicating with room XXIII, a perfectly preserved wooden hinge was found, measuring 10 X 10 cm., hollowed in the middle and kept fixed to the ground by a clay covering. The rooms were heated by a central hearth (figs. 47, 90), with a rectangular, almost square shape, and built with a clay bench, in the middle of which an elliptical hole was bored, sometimes reaching a depth of 30 cm., in which combustion took place or the ashes were preserved. The hearths were often bordered by a raised clay edge. The sides of the bench varied in size from 30 to 60 cm. Hearths of this type are very practical, since the heat is well distributed and preserved throughout the bench in such a way that the food can be heated at different temperatures, higher in the oven and lower round the sides of the hearth. A different use was undoubtedly reserved for the hemicyclical ovens, of which the best preserved example has been found in the ? House of the Stairs ?, up against the SW corner of room XVIII (fig. 84). The oven was evidently hemispherical, with a horse? shoe shape. The discovery of a portable earthenware hearth, that probably represented a model of the hemispherical ovens, has enabled us to reconstruct the domed roof that has 305</page><page sequence="24">disappeared in the larger ovens. The walls of the oven were built, at least up to a certain height, with a row of vertically laid bricks, two of which were made to lean against the walls of the room. We have already observed that the oven in room XVIII is not leant directly against the western wall, but is separated from it by a small space filled with potsherds: this is perhaps a device intended to prevent the heat from being dispersed or the plaster from burning. The floor of the oven, composed of a narrow layer of clay, rested on a brick network laid long side out, so that it was raised about 10 cm. off the ground. The oven floors burnt very quickly and were frequently rebuilt. In room XVIIFs oven at least nine superimposed layers of burnt clay have been counted. The oven's domed roof was probably perforated by regularly spaced holes, as the model found in the adjacent room XIX (phase lie) would seem to demonstrate. The stokehole was low down, almost on a level with the floor, and was marked by a basin-shaped sill. In order probably to avoid the heat dispersing, the side of the oven that was not in contact with the walls of the room was made of two curtains of bricks about 10 cm. apart. In this way, a sort of interstice was created, containing, in the case of room XVIII, a large amount of gray ashes. The use of these ovens was presumably limited to cooking food. It would have been difficult for a plant of this type to develop a temperature of over 500?; thus it could not have been used for firing pottery, especially as the hemispherical shape did not allow an adequate heat distribution. Ovens of this type are still used throughout most of Iran to bake bread. In the course of the survey conducted in southern Sistan during the 1968 campaign, a tepe was discovered not far away from one of the main branches of the R?d-i Biy?b?n, the ancient delta of the Hilmand. It is a small-sized tepe whose main feature is that of being entirely covered by imperfectly fired pottery rejects and waste. The painted motifs that can still be recognized on many of them associate them to the painted pottery of Shahr-i Sokhta. 42 large kilns, still excellently preserved, are distributed over the whole of the surface of rise. Two fairly exposed kilns, from which we removed all the debris contained in them, are Y-shaped, with a large chamber (2 X 1.20 m.) branching off into two smaller ones, with a vaulted roof ending in a chimney. The walls of the kilns were partly built with large bricks of unbaked clay (50 X 20 cm.). The inside of the kiln is a greenish colour and is completely vitrified. Drops formed by the hardening of melted clay can be seen quite clearly. The kiln was covered on the outside by a thick mantle of clay and earth, completely oxidized by the heat from the cen? tral chamber. The inner floor, rich in pottery remains, has been calcined by the high tem? perature. This must obviously have been a reducing furnace, able to reach temperatures of around 1000?. Only by using kilns of this type could the Black-on-Gray Ware be pro? duced. The porcellaneous paste and metallic gray colour of this pottery are typical of gres, which notoriously requires temperatures not below 950? (15). (15) Personal communication from Mr V. U. Cecconi, technical consultant on ipottery. 306</page><page sequence="25">The fact that the kilns were concentrated in a single point is an element that will be kept in consideration in future research. There evidently existed in protourban Sis tan whole areas, we might almost say factories, where the kilns and perhaps the actual potteries were concentrated. THE FINDS Pottery Preface to the Classification and Study of the Pottery Examination of the numerous finds is one of the major problems posed by research in protohistoric Sist?n. Our last excavation campaign at Shahr-i Sokhta has presented us with such an abundance of pottery, figurines, seals, bones, etc. that only the use of the most advanced systems for recording and analysing the cultural material will enable us to ap? proach their typology from a systematic angle. We have seen how the different phases of the city's life were represented by an alter? nation of floorings, floods and artificial fillings. The latter, in particular, have permitted massive finds to be made: the fragments of pottery collected during the excavation of the ? House of the Stairs ? may be calculated as several hundred thousand, while there are over 200 intact vessels. A complete study of the Shahr-i Sokhta ceramics, which could be the keystone for a series of research on the most ancient civilizations of eastern Iran and the Hilmand Valley, cannot be achieved without making a detailed inspection of all the extremely vast amount of material collected. On the other hand, these artificial fillings have a certain logical coherence, that should not be ignored. If in fact there is a maximum documentation of pottery, metal objects, on the contrary, are few and insignificant: this being due to the fact that these objects could be used again, after being melted down and turned into other objects, and thus were not normally wasted as a filling to raise the floor level. Thus it must constantly be borne in mind that should the filling technique recognized in the ? House of the Stairs ? prove to be the general rule throughout the settlement, evidence of metallurgy in Shahr-i Sokhta is likely to be very scarce in future. In spite of the abundance of the finds, we will consequently avoid drawing final con? clusions as to Shahr-i Sokhta's cultural framework, in view of the particular conditions of our excavation. Only a thorough typological study, that will be linked to the progressive extension of the excavation, will permit us to reconstruct a sufficiently well-grounded historical and cultural picture. The pottery found in the fillings of the rooms excavated so far in Shahr-i Sokhta represents an essential factor for the study of the community's development. The consid 307</page><page sequence="26">erable number of sherds collected and their perfect state of preservation have supplied us with such a wealth of evidence as to persuade us to adopt a method of global research, as? suming as a term of reference the analysis of all the sherds and vessels so as to identify the primary types and their variants. This method was introduced some years ago by G. Lapla? ce for the study of the Upper Palaeolithic blade industry (16). The French scholar has defi? ned his method analytical typology, as opposed to the other methods used in the study of Prehistory (descriptive, geographical and statistic), grouped together under the expression: traditional morphological typology, or, in antithesis, empirical typology. With the subtle insight of a philosopher, Laplace has frequently underlined the inner contradictions of mor? phological typology, which, based on the completely subjective identification of given pieces on the basis of specific functions, strictly morphological considerations, more or less strati graphically defined archaeological periods, and so on, gives rise to incoherent definitions that are subject to an uncontrolled, ? anarchique ?, development. Analytical typology was in fact created with the aim of remedying the confusion caused by the classical morpho? logical types. It consists basically in the search for exhaustive denominations for all the types, considered as a whole, so that the elaboration and experimentation of the system proceed interdependently. The dilatation of the types and the confusion of the definitions are thus able to be braked. A priori concepts do not exist, but the examination of the whole of a specified typological group (lithic industry, ceramics, metallurgy, etc.) reveals the existence of the original forms and their derivations. In this manner, the definition of the primary-type, ? veritable theme typologique ?, which may have variations or secondary types, is achieved. In reality, the existence of each primary-type depends on its secon? dary types: it would be difficult to find a primary-type without an index of variability, in the lithic industry no less than in prehistoric ceramics. In this sense, analytical typology is intended to be extremely dynamic, accepting the permeation of the whole of a material culture by an internal dialectic that is considered as an expression of the continual contra? dictions of a human community. Classification consequently becomes a rational order of growing complexity, whose main attributes are represented by the accuracy of its definitions and the clarity of its symbols. The primary type, whose function, as has been observed, is that of indicating the constant basic typological theme, is defined by a combination of technical and mor? phological characters. While the former stress the relation between the piece and its creator, within a specified technological context, the morphological characters reflect the personality of the observer, of the scholar who has examined the piece. In consequence, the value of analytical typology is strictly tied to the morphological characters selected as primary types. (16) G. Laplace, ? Typologie analytique.

Definitions of the primary types are thus exclusively morphotechnical and permit their being grouped together in classes of primary types, united, in their turn, in typological groups, on the basis of morphological and tech? nical indications. No further space need be devoted to this brief introduction to Laplace's method. The Author has gradually perfected his method in the course of over ten year's research, so that it should answer the classification requirements of the vast industrial complex of the late European Palaeolithic Age. In his conclusive study, moreover, he has obtained results that go far beyond his original intentions: the significance of typological analysis, as a method of research, lies in its reappraisal of a whole theoretical need that has been deeply felt in archaeological circles. D. Clarke has recently succeeded in extending the more sophisticated systems of sta? tistical and taxonomic inquiry to other sectors of archaeological research, interpreting a need that had been keenly felt in all circles interested in archaeological research (17). In this way, analytical typology has been transferred from a relatively limited sector, such as that of the Upper Palaeolithic, to a vast field of interest, often finding the most unexpected applications. It is undoubtedly the best answer to far-ranging problems calling for global analysis of the material culture or of its individual aspects. In this way, study of a specific type of pottery does not differ from that of the leptolithic complexes, since despite the potentially infinite vastness of the themes to be examined, the need for global and detailed treatment of the materials is identical and can only be answered by statistical, mathematical, taxonomic ? in a word, analytical ? methods. Faced with these general propositions and urged on by the considerable amount of material that is being collected on the entire process of the urbanization of the Hilmand, we have consequently striven to adapt this analytical typology to the study and classifica? tion of the Shahr-i Sokhta ceramics so as to acquire a basis for our imminent studies on its duration, diffusion and relations with the surrounding cultural areas. It is not the first time that a process of this type has been applied to the study of a pottery complex. Fairly similar systems have been widely used for the cultures of the American South West (18). Mainly on the basis of these experiences, A. O. Shepard has assembled an enormous amount of evidence on ceramics and its potential interest for the archaeologist (19). The subject is too vast for the book not to be lacking in omissions and superficiality, but it has made an undeniable contribution to the rationalization of the study of ceramics. (17) D. L.

This analysis was the starting point, as well as providing several suggestions, for the compilation of the decorative motifs of Shahr-i Sokhta, described in an appendix to this report. Miss Shepard's criticism of the actual type concept is of particular interest (21). The pottery type is too often a generalization from many fragments and is thus reconstructed in its entirety by the combination of incomplete pieces. Moreover, the type is subject to a process of change that is so gradual that only detailed and amply documented examination can give a typological deviation its true chronological value. In other words, Miss Shepard, like Laplace, criticizes descriptive typology and confirms the basic concept that the type should be understood as a combination of dynamic elements whose existence depends on their insertion in the logic of a cultural dialectic. The study of the technological features is of unquestioned importance: in the first place, it directs the typologist's attention to the human factor of the pottery under exami? nation; in the second place, it permits a better distinction between primary and casual variations; finally, it offers more valid criteria for delimiting types. It is however the style of a vessel (form -f- decoration) that provides us with the means of identifying a primary type in its dynamic value. In this connexion, it should be observ? ed that style changes more rapidly than technique. This assumption is based on the fact that once the best clays, tempers, pigments and kilns available have been adopted, there is no incentive to try others, since they have satisfied certain basic practical needs that tend to govern the whole of the pottery manifacturing. Form and design are thus the fea? tures that enable us to identify a primary type and its development both in time and space. Equally well-known is the essay by P. Delougaz (22) on the principles of ceramic clas? sification, introducing his study of the pottery complex of the Diyala Valley. Here the forms were subdivided into ten groups according to their geometrical contour, considered schematically and represented by digits proceeding from 0 to 9, in direct relation to the tapering of the contour towards the rim. This is a highly dynamic typology that, despite its subdivisions, treats the pottery complex as a unit, since it strives to keep the relation between digit and contour direction constant. Deriving from this is the particular attention devoted to fairly sophisticated typome trical systems based on diagrammatical scales for the constant proportions (23). The artificiality of so rigid a system cannot however be ignored. In its application to the Diyala ceramics, Delougaz himself did not always succeed in keeping within its limits. The system answers perfectly the needs of museum inventory and adapts itself to pottery complexes that are not only extremely complex but are also very rich in material.

In the second place, the absence of the fast wheel in Shahr-i Sokhta pottery production would have made the use of such rigid typometrical systems as those described by Delougaz somewhat precarious. The attempt to apply Laplace's analytical typology to Shahr-i Sokhta's ceramics also responds to a precise need. In the classification of the pottery of the Indo-Iranian Border? land use was made mostly of methods of descriptive comparison and, in a few cases, of sporadic statistical methods (24). Apart from the vagueness and superficiality of many of the observations, these methods had a fractionizing effect that has probably hindered the reconstruction of definite cultural zones. We are not yet in a position to say whether Laplace's analytical typology, which was adapted and experimented on for the leptolithic complexes, can be applied to the study of painted pottery with only a few substantial modifications. It will, however, enable us to assemble a series of objective data, using the maximum amount of material and the mini? mum amount of interpretation. It is our conviction at the present time that this is the best system for making use of the considerable mass of data that we were lucky enough to find up to now, so that we will soon be able to have a precise term of reference for all our research in the region. Buff Ware and Gray Ware The wealth of ceramic material found belongs for the most part to Periods II and HI, while material from Period I has only been found in the restricted areas excavated in trench RYL and the testing pits in rooms XIX and XX. The contrast is such that the same treatment cannot be reserved for three periods with such an irregular quantity of evidence: against the few dozen sherds of the more ancient period, the evidence of Periods II and III is overwhelming. In this second preliminary Report we will consequently deal separately with the Pe? riod I pottery, merely presenting the more significant sherds and noting the features that oppose or associate it to that of the following periods. There is an equally irregular documentation for each period, between the two classes into which Shahr-i Sokhta pottery can be substantially divided: Buff Ware and Gray Ware. Both forms have frequently been found throughout eastern Iran and along the Hilmand, (24) W. A. Fairservis, Jr., Excavations in the Quetta Valley, West Pakistan (Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History, 45), 1956, pp. 330-333. According to Fairservis, the quantity of sherds of a specific type of pottery, in each cut, makes it possible to reconstruct a series of parallel diagrams, repre? senting the so-called ? Structural Stratigraphy ?. 311</page><page sequence="30">up as far as Mundigak and northern Bal?chist?n. Buff Ware is a pottery with a semide purated paste, whose colour varies from light yellow to yellowish red (25). The design, when applied, was painted in a colour varying from black to light brown, owing to the irregular dilution of the paint (figs. 22-32, 119, 120). Hence it is distinguished as Plain Buff Ware or Black-to-Brown-on-Buff Ware, depending simply on the presence or absence of a painted design. Obviously, since there are no other differences, both varieties may be iden? tified typologically by the expression Buff Ware. The Gray Ware pottery, found over a far wider area than the former, is a much more valuable product. It is composed of a ? gres ? with a porcellaneous paste, fired in kilns reaching an extremely high temperature (at any rate, not inferior to 950?C). The clay in the paste is completely depurated, thus permitting thin walls and slender, inflected forms. The colour, dark gray, is not subject to the variations that are a characteristic of Buff Ware pottery. The painted decoration is monochrome and is applied directly onto the surface of the vessel (figs. 33, 121). Depending on the colour of the paint, Gray Ware has been subdivided into: Black-on-Gray Ware and Red-on-Gray Ware. On the basis of the data obtained from the Period I strata, it seems probable that there was a certain chronological gap between the two varieties. The Red-on-Gray Ware was, in fact, found almost exclusively in the Period I strata and is absent in the later ones, while the Black-on-Gray Ware is present in all three. The colour of the paint appears, however, to be the only element for differentiating between the two varieties, which do not, at the present time, present mutually distinctive features. During our excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta, Buff Ware and Gray Ware have always been found in association, but the latter is fairly rare (about 5%) and no whole vessel was found in the pottery fillings, possibly a partial confirmation, this, of the value attributed to Gray Ware by the inhabitants of Shahr-i Sokhta themselves. This type of pottery is thus only known to us in sherd form and both the shapes and decorative motifs have to be reconstructed by painstakingly piecing the sherds together. The two classes of pottery we are describing differ in paste, firing, shape and decora (25) Under the term ? buff ? we have included a fairly wide range of colour, due in part to clay variations and in part to firing temperature variations. We feel it is advisable to give a more detailed analysis of the chromatic features of such a frequently found type of pottery. The Munsell Soil Color Charts, Baltimore, 1954, have provided an excellent basis for reference. The following is a list of the principal chroma values, derived from the examination of several hundreds of Buff Ware sherds: Hue Value/Chroma 2.5YR 6/8 Light Red 5 YR 7/6 Reddish Yellow 7.5YR 8/2 Pinkish White 7.5YR 8/4 7.5YR 8/6 10 YR 8/3 10 YR 8/4 10 YR 8/6 10 YR 6/8 10 YR 5/6 2.5Y 8/2 2.5Y 8/4 2.5Y 8/6 2.5Y 7/4 5 Y 8/2 5 Y 8/3 5 Y 8/4 5 Y 7/6 Pink Reddish Yellow Very Pale Brown Very Pale Brown Yellow Brownish Yellow Yellowish Brown White Pale Yellow Yellow Pale Yellow White Pale Yellow Pale Yellow Yellow 312</page><page sequence="31">tion; but apart from this, the material they supply us with is so different that even in this case we cannot permit ourselves to treat them in the same fashion. Gray Ware calls in fact for a special study in consideration of its wider geographical diffusion, the advanced techniques employed in its production, its extremely interesting decorative motifs and its undeniable historical implications with regard to contemporary and posterior production of this kind. In conclusion, Buff Ware, thanks to the wealth of material in our possession, repre? sents the starting point for our typological research. It should once again be borne in mind, in this connexion, that the excavation of the fillings of the ? House of the Stairs ? and the surrounding buildings has supplied us with a considerable amount of whole forms and that it is most unusual for the excavation of a settlement to produce material evidence of this type. It should be added that as we are not dealing with tombs, stores or temple deposits, whose pottery tends to differ in quality from that in current use, we can be certain that what we have before us is ? real evidence ? of the pottery in common use at Shahr-i Sokhta. Buff Ware forms and decorative motifs will be examined in view of a global documen? tation of all the pottery production of this type, in the conviction that this is the way to set up a valid basis for the reconstruction of the material culture of this civilization and of its extension in time and space. The method adopted is that of ? analytical recording ? and is based on the classifica? tion of the forms, reduced to their simplest geometrical contour, and on the preliminary decomposition of the decorative motifs so as to make it possible to adopt the punched cards system for the assembly of the data (26), with very simple codes. Shahr-i Sokhta Buff Ware was undoubtedly produced on a very large, almost indus? trial scale, to satisfy the ever increasing consumer demand. Forms and decorative motifs are highly standardized and should be considered very limited in number, in view of the amount of pottery examined; while the firing techniques were perfected to the point of giving rise to an extraordinarily uniform production. This undeniable tendency to uniformity, in a type of pottery that must have been the most commonly used variety, constitutes an essential datum for the elaboration of our typo? logical method. Since we are faced with a necessarily standardized production, our main task will be that of identifying, within the general categories of the pottery, the primary types in which it is concentrated. These primary types, both with regard to form and with regard to decorative themes (far more numerous), will represent the constant term of reference in all our work. For research purposes we have examined the shape of the vessel and its decoration separately: a highly artificial expedient. We will, in fact, at the end of our work, see to what extent the decorative syntax can depend on the form on which it is applied. (26) Shepard, op. cit., pp. 322-324. 313</page><page sequence="32">Manufacturing Techniques The use of the fast-wheel for pottery production seems to have been unknown to the Shahr-i Sokhta potters. In spite of this, they managed to create forms of extreme perfec? tion: sinuous contours, polished surfaces, thin and homogeneous walls. Thus, if the struc? ture of the vessel and the treatment of its surfaces exclude, for the time being at any rate, the use of the wheel ? which in any case only appears in the later phases of the Indus Civilization (27) ? the adoption of a turn table, at least, should be considered probable. Many forms, beakers in particular, bear the impressions of the fingers that turned them on their inside (fig. 110). F. R. Allchin has studied the problem of the chronological priority of the one system with regard to the other (28). Allchin's study permits us to attribute a more precise meaning to the expression ? slow wheel ?, which in itself represented an evident contradiction in terms. These turn-tables consist in veritable perforated discs, still in use today in Mah?r?stra and Deccan (India), and their discovery in Taxila is a proof of their antiquity (29). It may be presumed that most of them were built in perishable material, so that it is at least improbable that the excavation data will allow us to go deeper into this aspect of the problem in the future. After confirming that the forms were for the most part created without the aid of a wheel, we should now add that the methods used were essentially three: coil-building and ring-building for the larger forms; hand-modelled building for the smaller ones (30). In the coil-building method, ? the walls of the vessel are formed by the additon of sausage shaped rolls of clay of various length ?. The excellent state of preservation of the finds has enabled us to enter into possession of real coils, the rejects of incomplete vessels that had been discarded before firing. Several forms of Plain Buff Ware, the most common pottery, were not even smoothed over, so that the joins between one coil and another are still visible. In fig. 115, showing an example of ogival jar, one of the less finished forms, this production method is perfectly identifiable. The smaller-sized vessels, such as beakers, small jars and, to a lesser extent, bowls, were modelled directly by hand, and it was probably in these cases that the turn-table was employed. Hand-modelled building could only be adopted for the production of forms requiring a quantity of clay that could be controlled by one hand. The remains of incomplete vessels showing no signs of coiling have been discovered (figs. 116-118). For the production of large-sized forms, such as the barrels and some of the jars, the (27) R. E.

This method is similar to coiling, but differs from the latter in that the vessel is built by superimposing different sized rings of clay, put to? gether and modelled with the aid of a small stick. Ring-building, most suited, as we have seen, to the larger forms, may be identified by the joins, which are located along the line attaching one ring to the other. Buff Ware production techniques are thus most varied, in relation to the shapes that were better suited to each system. The question becomes more complex in the case of Gray Ware, since we have here a type of pottery offering symmetrically proportioned forms with thin walls and a highly polished surface. We are not, however, of the opinion that the qualities of Gray Ware are to be attributed to the use of the potter's wheel. It would, in fact, be very strange for two categories of pottery and two production techniques to be so clearly dissociable. In reality, Gray Ware differs from Buff Ware for two different reasons that have nothing to do with the use of the wheel. First of all, Gray Ware, as we have already explained earlier on, is composed of a completely refined and degreased paste, which, owing to its greater compactness and plasticity, and to the addition of ashes may be worked into thin and slender forms. In the second place, firing in kilns reaching high temperatures has solidi? fied the paste, making it almost porcellaneous. The extreme smoothness of the surfaces could be due to stick burnishing or smoothing systems. Many sherds still bear the im? pressions left by the tools used for smoothing them down (figs. 111-114). These tools were made of wood, stone or bone, but more often consisted merely in pieces of broken pottery (31). In some cases, the impressions suggest that a roller-type instrument was pas? sed over the outer surface, or, more simply, that an actual ? shaving ? process was em? ployed (32). Buff Ware Forms in Periods II and III The classification of the pottery forms ha^ been divided up into three main sections: Groups (or typological families), determined on the basis of distinctions and terminology that, being in extensive use in archaeological circles, cannot be ignored by analytical typo? logy; Classes, which, in the present case, represent the actual application of the method of analytical research; and finally Types, whose identification, both in Groups and in Classes, is achieved on the basis of data derived almost exclusively from typometrical or production technique factors. It is this third category that gives rise to the formation of our primary types which, made up of the sum of their variants, will serve to provide us with the ? typological themes ?. (31) Hodges, op. cit.} p. 27. (32) Hodges, op. cit., p. 26. 315</page><page sequence="34">The Groups (or typological families) identified up to now are substantially five: 1 - Beakers 2 - Small jars 3 - Jars 4 - Bowls 5 - Flasks The value of each of these Groups is connected less with typology than with relative terminology; thus they do not require any detailed explanation. Their use will facilitate direct reference and make the subdivisions based exclusively on geometric and typometric data more comprehensible. It should be admitted that subdivision into groups presents a number of subjective features: the distinction between small jars and beakers, for ex? ample, appears highly artificial and is justified principally by the massive presence of pear shaped beakers, an inflected form that is particularly frequent among the material collected and that has been defined beaker merely for the sake of easier reference, without any func? tional implication. It should be remembered at this point that all the forms have a vertical axis of revo? lution: their profile, in other words, does not change when they are revolved about their central axis and their horizontal sections are circles. The production techniques, as we have seen, have clearly been simplified to the utmost: anthropomorphic or naturalistic forms in general are entirely lacking; also absent are plastic, pinched and applied decorations and handles, while eyelets and spouts are fairly rare. Our typology is consequently based exclusively on the geometry and contour of the shapes. For the definition of Classes, on the contrary, we have made use of the theoretical framework provided by the studies by G. D. Birkhoff and A. O. Shepard (33). The shapes have been classified on the basis of their contours and proportions, while we have tried to avoid any reference to the possible functions of the vessel, considering each piece solely from the angle of its geometric form. Fig. 1 - The characteristic points of a vessel profile, established by G. D. Birkhoff {from Shepard). t (33) G. D. Birkhoff, Aesthetic Measure, Cambridge, 1933; Shepard, op. cit., pp. 225-227, fig. 18 (here, fig. 1). 316</page><page sequence="35">With the intention of establishing a number of fixed reference points, Birkhoff con? sidered the points on which the eye rests as ? characteristic points ? (fig. 1). They comprise: a) End Points (EP) of the curve at base and lip; b) Points of Vertical Tangency (VT), corresponding to the points of maximum diameter on a spheroidal form and of minimum diameter on a hyperbolic form; c) Inflection Points (IP) where the curvature changes from concave to convex or vice-versa; d) Corner Points (CP) where there is a sharp change in contour (variations in the direction of the tangent). As A. O. Shepard affirms, the fundamental importance of these points lies in the fact that both the dimensions and the proportions of the vessel may be calculated from them (34). Their exact identification is thus of the utmost importance not only for an analytical ex? amination of the shapes, but also for the recognition of specific production techniques. On the basis of the four characteristic points described above, it is consequently pos? sible to establish the actual structural classes which, according to Miss Shepard, are essen? tially three (fig. 2): 1 - Vessels with unrestricted orifice: Unrestricted Vessels; 2 - Vessels with restricted orifice: Simple and Dependent Restricted Vessels; 3 - Vessels with neck: Independent Restricted Vessels. The first class comprises forms in which the diameter of the orifice is also the maxi? mum diameter of the vessel (the vertical tangent at the orifice is perpendicular to or in? clined outward from the line of the vessel base). In the second class, on the contrary, the tangent at the end point is inclined inward, rim modifications naturally being disregarded. The maximum diameter of the vessel, in the class under examination, is always below the rim. As to the third and last class, rather than describe the various types of neck in geo? metric terms, Miss Shepard has preferred to introduce the expression ? independent ves? sels ? to indicate forms in which the corner point and inflection point are distinct from the maximum diameter. A more inclusive class, into which vessels with indefinite contours are not admitted, is formed in this way. The classes described above are each subdivided by contour type into simple, com? posite, inflected and complex forms (35). (34) Shepard, op. cit., p. 225, fig. 18.

Once the probable pro? duction technique of a specific class had been established, we selected some measurements that after being related one to another would be able to supply the necessary typological constants. In the case of the pear-shaped beakers ? a biconical form, geometrically speaking ? for example, the ratio vessel height/upper cone height would provide the proportional constant for determining the extent to which the upper cone was longer than the lower one (fig. 3). In this way, it became far easier to establish which specimens could be defined pear-shaped (the ratio between the height of the upper cone and that of the lower cone being 1.3: 1) rather than biconical (1:1 ratio). Fig. 3 - Diagram illustrating the proportions used to define the types and sub-types of the pear-shaped beaker. In the same way, the degree of inflection or tapering is established on the basis of the ratio between the maximum and minimum diameter of the neck (the rim diameter is ex? cluded in this case, often being due to casual pressure by the potter's hand). This second ratio permits us to classify the types according to the degree of neck inflection in relation to the maximum diameter, calculated in the pear-shaped beaker class from the ratio of 1.3 : 1 between the height of the cones. This is a somewhat artificial process, but has proved extremely useful in a massive work of typological classification that was obliged to start from zero owing to the lack of any precise points of reference: it is a taxonomic system, prior to the use of forms of ana? lytical recording by means of punched cards and recorded memories. Our system does not, however, exclude simpler references that do not dissociate the type from currently used terminology. The plates (figs. 19-21) give a fairly detailed example of our typology. Each plate refers to one of Shepard's structural categories (fig. 2) and the individual types are estab? lished on the basis of their generical membership of a group and their contour character 319</page><page sequence="38">istics. Structure, contour and typometric values can in this manner contribute to the estab? lishment of a uniform classification. Each type of form is represented by a symbol derived from a trinary code, so as to facilitate the use of punched cards to record the thousands of vessels and sherds that will come to light. Placed at the beginning of the symbol, A indicates the unrestricted forms, B the sim? ple and dependent restricted forms and C the independent restricted forms. The second letter in the symbol stands instead for the class of contour in which the piece under exa? mination may be included. This second class will naturally begin with the letter of the alphabet immediately following the one adopted to indicate the structural class to which the piece belongs: thus, for example, to give a typological definition to a bowl with a sim? ple contour, the first two letters will be AB, while for a bowl with a composite contour they will be AC. The third letter making up the symbol represents the specific type being subjected to typological examination. It should however be made clear that the letter is not bound to a strict alphabetical order in that, as our research proceeds, it may happen that new types appear, belonging to a single class of contours, that require insertion among the types already classified in the catalogue. In our system, should this occur, they would be distin? guished with the letter immediately following those already used, without altering the order already established. However, in order to facilitate the examination of the forms presented, we are providing the definition of each symbol of reference (file).

In fact, a number of sherds that had been protected by their particular stratigraphical posi? tion, bear traces of a brightly coloured decoration, applied directly onto the surface of the vessel, inside geometrical motifs painted in a blackish brown colour. The colours most favoured prove to be red, white, yellow and blue and were derived from various mineral substances: cinnabar for red, ochre for yellow, chalk for white and pulverized lapis lazuli for blue. An examination of the fragments found reveals that the mineral substances, being practically insoluble, were not dissolved in a liquid solution, but were applied directly onto the surface of the pottery. The result is that the colouring matter leaves no trace on the surface of the vessel once it has been removed. The decoration tends to dissolve not only on contact with any foreign body or object but even merely on exposure to air. We have, in fact, been obliged to proceed with the utmost caution in handling the few sherds that were found, so as to prevent them from losing their polychrome coating. The colours were applied in such a way as to allow their polychrome effect to har? monize with the black-brown tint of the basic design. Preference appears to have been given to alternating colours: a very simple chromatic device that was facilitated, in the case in question, by the frequency of geometric designs with a specular or alternated symmetry. Fig. 124 shows a tooth-edged cross whose body is painted in yellow, whilst its triangular branches are coloured red and yellow alternately. The same technique of alternating colours may be seen in fig. 122, where it is ex? tended to the entire syntax of the vessel, so that the whole composition has the appearance of an orderly red and yellow chess-board. This orderly chromatic geometry is also visible in another sherd (fig. 123), where the festoons delimiting a circle with rays are coloured red and yellow alternately. Where the black-brown colour of the design is also considered, it may be said that the decoration used for each individual vessel is always trichromatic. In fact, all the sherds found up to now have the same characteristic: it would not appear, in other words, that more than three colours were used at a time. Particularly elegant is the fragment of a pottery box, whose polychrome decoration, in which a white (chalk) and blue (lapis lazuli) design stands out against a red-brown back? ground, has been preserved intact (fig. 125). Here again, the effect is essentially bichrome, since the white and blue practically cover the red-brown background beneath and empha? size the alternating symmetry of the two superimposed friezes with stepped motifs. The sherd's most interesting feature is not, however, confined to its artistic aspect, but principally concerns the economic relations between Shahr-i Sokhta and the world out? side. We have already had the occasion to note the immense importance of lapis lazuli 322</page><page sequence="41">in western Asia's economic history (36), and we have now been offered a further proof or the considerable use made of this semi-precious stone probably imported from a far off region like Badakhsh?n (37), in Shahr-i Sokhta. We know that lapis lazuli, in powder form, was commonly adopted as a colouring matter, but this pottery box fragment is one of the most ancient proofs of its use, which has been amply documented in later ages. Fragments of yellow ochre and other colouring matter have been found in various points of the excavation and will be subjected to chemical analysis for a further confirma? tion of their use in polychrome decoration. The material found up to now permits us to make several minor observations in the meantime: a) potsherds with a polychrome design have been found in all three of the periods into which we have decided to divide the Shahr-i Sokhta sequence; b) polychrome decoration is always applied on the surface of restricted forms with neck belonging to the Jar Group. Bowls and beakers appear to be excluded by this type of decoration, possibly due to the use these vessels were made for; c) much of the Buff Ware may have been decorated with a polychrome design that has not been preserved up to our day. We do not consider it necessary, therefore, to make polychrome pottery a separate typological category; d) we have been able to observe on all the sherds examined that there is a relation between the cursivization of the outlines of the design and its polychrome decoration. We would like, in conclusion, to make an observation of a historical nature, regard? ing the whole of the Indo-Iranian Borderland. The only protohistoric polychrome pottery found in this region up to now is that of N?l (38) and there was probably a relation between the two productions. It is generally maintained that the N?l pottery was contemporary to the later phases of the Kulli Culture and of the Indus Civilization, and thus less ancient than that of Shahr-i Sokhta. Already in 1956, D. H. Gordon had formed the hypothesis that it should be considered the result of a technique that had originated elsewhere, in centres situated further west (3f&gt;). The polychrome pottery from Shahr-i Sokhta is the first that has been found as yet west of N?l with similar features to this painted pottery. Although the vascular shapes and design are substantially dissimilar, the colouring matter employed at N?l (yellow, red-brown and gray-green) and the application techniques may be considered identical.

Introduction to the Pottery from Period I At the present time, the pottery from Shahr-i Sokhta in Period I consists of about 200 sherds of Buff and Gray Ware: a paltry amount, as we have already pointed out, in comparison with that of the following periods, II and III. Nevertheless, we are already able to note fairly considerable differences between this first phase of life in the city and the later phases. In fact, while Periods II and III are culturally uniform, Period I is distin? guished by a number of features all its own, especially as regards Buff Ware. Gray Ware will thus not be examined, although its most significant sherds will be presented. This brief comparative analysis will be limited to Buff Ware, following the same line as was adopted for our analysis of Periods II and III. All the forms that have been reconstructed so far were also present in the later periods: jars with high cylindrical neck (fig. 36), globular jars with curved rims (fig. 36 a, b, d), hemispherical (fig. 35 c) and truncated conical bowls (fig. 34 a, c, e, g, i, k, 1) of dif? ferent sizes, small pear-shaped jars (fig. 34 j) and truncated conical cups (figs. 34 b, d, f, h; 35 g, i, j, 1). On the other hand, forms such as pear-shaped beakers, ogival jars and small biconical high-necked jars, that were to be extremely common if not predominant in Periods II and III, appear to have been absent. The production techniques were unquestionably the same, although the Buff Ware of this initial period often had a more valuable paste than that of the later periods. It should not however be excluded that these are examples of a different type of pottery whose production was later confused with that of Buff Ware. The major differences, however, appear in the painted decoration. The paint usually has a red-brown colour that only very rarely darkens to black, and comes off easily, disin? tegrating when touched. Red is also the colour preferred for the decoration of Gray Ware (Red-on-Gray Ware). The possibility of altering the colour of the paint by varying its dilution appears to have been exploited by the Shahr-i Sokhta potters in this period in order to achieve special bichromatic effects in the painted design. At times, the spaces between the black bands in a particular pattern were filled in with a red-brown colour, while in other sherds this chromatic effect was achieved by alternating white, unpainted spaces with the painted sur? faces, so that the composition is characterized by a black and white bichrome effect (fig. 37). The entire decorative syntax of this pottery is far more organical from the aesthetic aspect than that of the Buff Ware of the later Periods, where chromatic alternations of this type are completely absent. It seems almost as if Buff Ware must have undergone a progres? sive deterioration in quality, although the sa me decorative themes and production tech? niques were preserved. 324</page><page sequence="43">-4 l~ B C F F G H D L R IT N S X J O T</page><page sequence="44">4 _ ]1 71 .1 , 1,4 ,-l, , I 4//o - - u 6)/5 It-0i21) 1 4 (5 1) (106) I ~ --007 ) 00.

A technique of this type is in fact testified in many cultural phases of prehistoric Bal?chist?n. Particular mention should be made of the Kechi Beg Ware pottery considered by Fairservis to be characteristic of the Damb Sadaat I period of the Quetta Valley (40). If we consider that D.S. I directly precedes the protourban periods D.S. II and D.S. Ill, characterized by the Quetta Ware pottery whose technique, form and decoration may be compared with both Shahr-i Sokhta II and III Gray and Buff Ware, it is only too obvious that interesting perspectives are concealed in the lower layers of the ? Burnt City?: so interesting in fact, that they will perhaps enable us to link together not only phases and periods but even entire processes of cultural formation. An equally obvious association exists between the Buff Ware of Period I and the Black-on-Buff and Black-on-Red Slip pottery of Southern Turkmenia, and in particular that originating from the strata of Geoksjur tepe, datable to the Namazga III Period (41). Full-bodied stepped motifs, variously reproduced in inlay compositions, and chromatic research for chiaroscuro effects are the most evident characteristics of the Turkmenian pot? tery as well. Stepped, spiralled and linear motifs combine to form different friezes (figs. 34 b-f; 36 c, e, f; 38 a-c, e-h), cross-hatched bands (fig. 35 c, e) and composite festoons (figs. 34 a, e, g, i, k; 35 b) being most frequent. Of the latter, one example is particularly interesting, due to its unique composition and bichromatic effects (fig. 37 a-n). Alternated ? black and white ? compositions seem to have been held in most favour. Squares, triangles and chevrons are to be found in all the friezes, always composed in such a manner as to be set against identical, unpainted surfaces. Apart from its painted decoration, this Period I pottery seems to be distinguished by the presence of applied elements and plastic designs. Particular attention should be given to the eyelets applied on the shoulders of the jars, that disappeared completely in the later periods (fig. 36 b). To conclude this brief introduction, however, it should be admitted that although emphasis has been given to certain elements that appear to distinguish this pottery from the identical production of the later periods, it is not yet possible to establish whether or not there existed a cultural difference or interruption between the periods themselves. In (40) Fairservis, op. tit. The author divides Kechi Beg Ware into three basic types: 1) Kechi Beg Black on Burl Slip, p. 256, fig. 50a, sherds 38-60; 2) Kechi Beg White on Dark Slip, p. 257, fig. 51, drawings 85-97; 3) Kechi Beg Polychrome, p. 259, fig. 53, drawings 66-84. The last of these three types is the one that is most comparable in style to the Buff Ware of Shahr-i Sokhta I. K. B. Polychrome seems, more? over, to have had a fairly brief life span; accord ing to Fairservis, in fact, it appears towards the end of the Kile Gul Mohammed IV Period and continues throughout the following -period, Damb Sadaat I.

Faced by the stratigraphical evidence, which does not reveal any interruption, when the variations, noted in pottery alone, are as minimal as in the present case, they can have no other significance. When the Radiocarbon examination has permitted us to express in absolute chronology terms the interval of time that today can only be described as ? Period ?, we will be able to give a more precise answer to our hypothesis. A settlement of the size of Shahr-i Sokhta undoubtedly has an extremely complex history behind it that may certainly not be reduced to a certain number of sche? matic Phases or Periods until a much more advanced stage in the research has been reached. In conclusion, if a more ancient Period, distinguishable on the basis of certain aspects of its material culture, existed at Shahr-i Sokhta, it is not, however, to be dissociated from the later Periods since it was most probably an integral part of the same historical phenomenon. Minor Pottery A portable hemispherical heater made of earthenware (fig. 65) has been unearthed in the phase II filling of room XIX. This is a flat-bottomed recipient with a semicircular vertical section and a domed roof perforated by 26 holes, each with a diameter of about 1 cm., symmetrically arranged in a circle of rays. The base, which is completely circular, is flat and has a diameter of 30 cm. (fig. 39). The stokehole, which is at the base of the dome, is rectangular and extends beyond the edge of the base so as to form a tiny sill with a raised edge 1 cm. high. On the sides of the stokehole were fitted the joins for a pottery handle with a circular section which has however disappeared in the example found. The hypothesis that this could be a heater may be substantiated by its resemblance to the well-known colander vessels that have been found throughout the Indo-Iranian Bor? derland and have long since been identified as actual heaters (fig. 30 c). Moreover, objects of this form found in Shahr-i Sokhta, perforated over much of their surface and able to be carried about thanks to the handle attached to their sides, would hardly be suitable to contain anything liquid. Among the other pottery objects found and not listed among the vessel forms, men? tion should be made of the theriomorphic vessels and clay boxes (fig. 42 b) which have already been examined in our previous preliminary report (42). No new element has been furnished by our 1968 campaign that should be added to our description of these two categories. (42) Tosi, op. cit., p. 56. 357</page><page sequence="150">On page 322, we have already mentioned the sherd of a small pottery box decorated with a symmetrical stepped motif in white on a lapis lazuli blue background (fig. 125). Considering the delicacy of the decoration applied, this is probably one of a very limited number of examples that have preserved the whole decoration, a feature which enables us to make a number of comparisons with other vessels of this type that have been found in different localities. At Namazga and Altyn Tepe, there have been numerous finds of pottery box fragments decorated on all their walls with stepped patterns that were not painted on, but engraved or in relief (fig. 127) (43). Identical recipients with a painted decoration, on the other hand, have been found at Mundigak (fig. 128) (44) and Damb Sadaat (45), whose decoration has been linked by Fairservis to that of the contemporary Quetta Ware. Unbaked Clay and Terracotta Figurines The only section of the finds, up to now, that is a possible indication of a religious element on the part of the inhabitants of Shahr-i Sokhta, is probably represented by the terracotta and unbaked clay figurines, objects that were extremely common throughout nearly all South Western Asia and whose diffusion seems to be linked to that of a rural religion divided up within a group of cults that were all connected with the fertility concept. The two excavation campaigns have enabled us to assemble a considerable amount of both theriomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines. We are not able to give a precise explanation of the specific attributions of these objects; we can only say that in the proto-urban communities of the 4th and 3rd millen? nia B.C. the subjects most directly connected with fertility were flanked by a whole series of representations drawn in particular from the animal world, whose various production suggests a diversification of the ancient cults. The Shahr-i Sokhta figurines, whose average height ranged from 3 to 8 cm., appear in various forms, although the most frequently represented subjects are the female figure (figs. 162-168) and the ox {bos indicus), both of which may clearly be linked to the fertility theme (figs. 129-140). All the figurines that we have brought to light, whether theriomorphic or anthropo? morphic, may be said to be in close relation to those of Mundigak III and IV (46). Hence this important section of the finds again confirms the almost complete identity of types and production techniques between the two centres of the Hilmand Valley in the 3rd mil? lennium B.C. Other subjects taken from the animal world comprise the wild boar (figs. 141-144), (43) Masson, op. cit. (1967), p. 182, fig. 14 (here, fig. 127). (44) J. M.

All the figurines are made ? often with a remarkable economy of physical features ? by modelling soft clay into suitable shapes. The animal is frequently represented in a posi? tion of attack, with its body strongly contracted. Particularly noteworthy are the models of a felid, identified by the sinuous shape of its limbs (fig. 148), and a wild boar with its body completely bent (fig. 141). Certain details are often represented with a vividly realistic sense, as in the case of a small mammal, possibly a rodent (fig. 151), with its ears bent over, and the head of an ox in unbaked clay (fig. 132), with its eye, half-open mouth, muzzle and pronounced dewlap reproduced with exceptional accuracy. Other figurines were enriched with simple decorative touches composed of nail inci? sions (fig. 131), bands of tiny holes (fig. 129), incised lines and small holes (fig. 130). The back of a horse-like animal, probably a wild ass, has been adorned with a saddle-cloth applied with incised strokes, while its mane was represented by means of a combination of nail incisions and pinchings (figs. 145, 146). It should however be added that most of the theriomorphic figurines in unbaked clay were not decorated at all: their bodies were for the most part modelled simply, though an anatomical detail was occasionally stressed. In the representations of the bos indicus the hump was often exaggerated (fig. 137). Painted decoration appears to have been limited to the few figurines whose clay was solidified by firing. In these examples a brush was used to paint in certain physical details (e.g. the eyes) or a parallel line decoration along both the animal's flanks. As this last ex? cavation has not supplied us with any more painted terracotta figurines, the reader should refer to the previous report for photographs and descriptions of the most significant examples. Although far less numerous than the theriomorphic ones, the anthropomorphic figu? rines have a much greater variety of shapes. From the typological aspect, we have divided them into three basic types: a) Figurines with a cylindrical body (figs. 152-157). In these examples, the body is represented by a simple cylinder, slightly convex at the sides, widening towards the base to form a small support and ending on top in two tiny arms, obtained by pinching the clay at the level of the shoulders. The head is often reduced to a mere cone-shaped apex be? tween the shoulders, while the arms are veritable truncated-cone-shaped stumps, usually held upwards: the characteristic position of a man in prayer. b) Figurines with a triangular body (figs. 158-161). Greater accuracy in the reproduc? tion of the human figure is to be noted in these examples. The body tends to taper from the shoulders to the waist, while the head and neck appear sharply distinguished and there is a certain respect for proportions. Some of these figurines are adorned with belts and 359</page><page sequence="152">necklaces composed, in one example, of the application of small lenticular discs (figs. 158, 159). This expedient appears to have been frequently adopted in Mesopotamia, as also, contemporarily, in various localities in Iran (47). More interesting, for its aesthetic solution, is a tiny figurine with a flat body and arms outstretched (figs. 160, 161). The head recalls a bird's skull and rests on a disproportionately lengthened neck, while its eyes are repre? sented with two incisions on the sides of the skull. Another example of the type is repre? sented by a small head on a high neck (figs. 169, 170), found without its body, in which the eyes are reproduced with two tiny applied lozenges. c) Figurines with a flexed body (figs. 162-168). This is the most recurrent type and is also the most interesting from the typological viewpoint. In its general outlines, the body recalls the shape of a violin; the upper part, from the shoulders to the waist, has assumed a triangular form; the shoulder line is straight and the arms are merely trape? zoidal elongations of the body. Under the waist, the pelvis swells out almost like a steato pygous figure, in sharp contrast with the contour of the upper part. Finally, the legs are reduced to a single conical appendix, jutting out in front almost in a perpendicular to the axis of the body. The anatomical details of this type of figurine are often reproduced with accentuated accuracy. Another feature of this category is that all the examples, being representations of the female figure, have been completed with the addition of two conical breasts, of which the only remaining trace is often the impression at the point in which they were attached (figs. 165-167). One of the examples differs from the others in that, in addition to the physical charac? teristics already described, it is distinguished by the reproduction of its vulva, represented by a small triangle drawn in with an incised line (fig. 171); the legs, which are bent back slightly, are separated by a furrow which, continuing behind, also outlines the buttocks. Though incomplete owing to the absence of its upper part, this tiny figurine (h. 3.3 cm.) is a little masterpiece of spontaneous naturalism. Its greatest interest, however, derives from the possibilities of comparisons it offers us. Figurines of this type, both in fragments and intact, have been found in truly remark? able quantities in the Geoksjur excavations, in levels attributable to the Namazga III Pe? riod (48). Some of these have been reproduced beside our example in order to give promi? nence to their typological identity (fig. 173). Among the Turkmenian examples, one in particular, that has been better preserved than the others (fig. 172), deserves a special mention: here the lower part of the body is reproduced completely ? pelvis, vulva and slightly bent back legs ? with a profound sense of realism, while the body and head are stylized to the utmost. The latter, in fact, (47) As an example, the buff clay figurines from the Eridu cemetery, with their lizard-like heads and applique pellets, should be remembered. S. Lloyd, F. Safar, ? Eridu.

XXIV, figs. 7-19 (here = fig. 173). 360</page><page sequence="153">looks like a bird's skull; while the body has become a mere cylinder, like a neck attached to the top of the pelvis. Some of the little heads found in Shahr-i Sokhta (figs. 169, 170) prove very close to this Turkmenian example both in shape and execution. Some of the figurines, however, which are perhaps the most interesting ones, do not fall under the above classification. Thus, for example, a female figure with a bag-shaped body ?- unfortunately incomplete in the upper part ? whose legs are folded under so as to appear in a squatting position (figs. 174, 175). It has a hole in the centre of its abdomen, to represent the navel or possibly the vulva, from which descends an incised furrow to separate the legs and mark the buttocks. The squatting figurine type is not very frequent in prehistoric South-Western Asia. In Mesopotamia, these statuettes are characteristic in contexts of the Tell Hal?f culture, in a very different cultural and chronological setting, while in Iran, Turkmenia and Bal?chist?n, the human figure is always represented in the erect position, or at least with its legs straight. In Shahr-i Sokhta itself, this specific example is unique in its kind in a group of several hundreds of anthromorphic figurines found up to now. Another atypical figurine deserving particular mention is the one reproduced in figs. 176, 177, which may be said to be a probable example of unfinished work. It has a round head with very generalized features, attached to a truncated-cone-shaped body that has preserved its pure geometrical form, with no trace of any modelling. Finally, a third figurine (figs. 178, 179) ? the head of a man on a truncated-cone shaped base ? represents a somewhat exceptional find for us, both as regards its size (4 X 11.8 cm., with a diameter, at the base, of 7 cm.) and the precise representation of the features of its face. Erosion has unfortunately destroyed much of it, but we are still able to appreciate some of its details: its circular ears are perforated at the level of their lobes, possibly in order to insert ear-rings; the face was probably bearded and the eyes, now missing, must originally have been superimposed, as the impression left by them at the points in which they were applied may still be seen. The truncated-cone-shaped base does not appear to reproduce any precise physical particular, but from the level of the base, the head appears to be bent backwards, with its face consequently turned upwards. Generally speaking, it may be affirmed that the unbaked clay anthropomorphic figu? rines are undecorated, although in actual fact the existence of small holes grouped in dif? ferent parts of the body is not infrequent. Missiles and Other Unbaked Clay Objects Missiles The unbaked clay missiles, found in great quantity in all the levels in Shahr-i Sokhta, are biconical in shape and their average measurements are 5 X 1.5 cm. (fig. 180). 361</page><page sequence="154">Made in depurated, highly compressed clay, they range in weight from 20 to 30 grams, and, once dried, must have had quite a considerable impact force. A hundred of the better preserved missiles, from rooms at different levels, have had all their earth and salt cleaned off and been weighed individually (see Appendix, Tabula I - Weight of missiles). These biconical missiles in unbaked clay have frequently been found in the most ancient South West Asian cultures. Those of Tepe Hiss?r, Period III, were described as weights (49). Our plate shows fairly clearly that there is a high variability index in the hundred pieces examined, nor does it seem likely to us that a friable, dilutable and contractible matter such as unbaked clay could have been used for the production of weights, for which very compact siliceous stones such as alabaster, basalt and granite were generally used, both in Mesopotamia and in the Indus Valley. Apart from Hiss?r, nearly all the excavations in the Indo-Iranian Borderland have unearthed missiles that are identical both in shape and size: Deh Morasi Ghundai II (50), Bampur IV (51), Mundigak IV, 1 (52). Miscellaneous The pottery jars were often closed with lids made of unbaked clay. Numerous lids of this kind have been found, some of which still bear the clear impressions left by the rim of the vessels onto which they were applied (figs. 182, 184). They are either cone-shaped (fig. 183) or have a small tab applied in the centre in order to make them easier to hold (figs. 181, 184). Their diameter is never larger than 10 cm. and they have a fairly crude appearance, although they do not differ greatly from many of the clay sealings that were used to stop up the mouths of the vessels and were intended to be impressed with seals (figs. 281-283). Unbaked clay was also used for a whole series of small objects whose function it has not always been possible to identify. A tablet with a dotted cross in the middle (fig. 185); a possible biconical spindle-whorl (fig. 190) and a second whorl decorated with incised radiat? ing lines (fig. 191); two small rectangular basins, both 6 cm. long (fig. 192); a small lens shaped disc, with one of its sides almost completely covered with tiny holes (fig. 189); and finally a flat-based cone, shaped like an ascendant spiral (fig. 186).

In fact, all the Period II pottery published by Dupree corresponds in shape and decoration to Shahr-i Sokhta II-IIFs Buff Ware (drawings 1-60). (51) B. de Cardi, ?

Wheeler ingeniously suggested might be connected with certain functions of personal cleanliness (53). A considerable number, often reduced to small frag? ments, were also found during the last excavation campaign. Braided Rush Matting Braided rush matting was produced in large quantities and widely employed. Vast portions of the H?m?n-i Hilmand are still covered by reeds and other marsh vegetation even today. The entire population of the lakeside villages is given over to gathering the reeds and making matting from them. In the 3rd millennium B.C., when the surface of the lake was much larger, the region undoubtedly permitted production on an even larger scale, thanks to its immense wealth of marsh vegetation. We have already noted how the matting was also used in house building: both under the plaster on the walls (room LVIII) and as part of the roofing, as a layer placed above the logs of wood and below the unbaked clay roof (room LXIX). This technique must, in fact, be the explanation of the fragments of clay bearing the impression of braided matting on one side (figs. 187, 188). These were obviously the remains of roof elements that still bear the traces of the underlying matting. Wooden Objects and Implements While the abundant collection of wooden objects and implements that we were able to bring to light, thanks to Shahr-i Sokhta's favourable environmental conditions, is an unquestionably interesting find, it also confronts us with problems that are by no means easy to solve. Due to the almost entire lack of any points of comparison, we have not in fact been able to identify the functions of many of them. We are certain however that with the continuation of our research and cooperation with ethnologists ? as is most desir? able ? it will at last be possible to document so important a section of the material culture as that connected with wood-working. At the time of going to press, we have not yet been able to identify the kind of wood used to make the objects concerned. We hope however that cooperation with various De? partments of Biology will shortly enable us to proceed to their identification. We will now attempt to describe these wooden objects, dividing them into groups according to their probable functions or form. (53) Wheeler, op. cit., pp. 75-76. 363</page><page sequence="156">Conical Ladles The conical ladles (figs. 42 a, 195, 196) are recipients with a height of 15-17 cm. and a rim diameter not exceeding 5 cm.: part of the body extends beyond the rim so as to form a rectangular or trapezoidal tongue about 5 cm. long. The production technique, which appears to have been extremely simple, has been reconstructed thanks to the find of an incomplete, roughly hewn ladle in the phase lib filling of room XIX, 5 (figs. 197, 198). A cylindrical segment, that was later to constitute the actual body of the ladle, was obtained from a branch of wood, cut in two points. The tongue was produced by leaving an appendage on one of the cut ends. The cylinder was then hollowed out, while the outer surface was tapered downwards till the walls of the little recipient took the shape of an inverted conoid. From a purely typological aspect, several very similar objects found in Amri in Period III levels (54) may be associated with the wooden ladles from Shahr-i Sokhta. The Amri ladles, made in terracotta, have a hemispherical contour, in contrast with the truncated cone-shaped profile of the Shahr-i Sokhta ones, but as regards handle, size and probably function, comparisons may well be drawn, albeit with certain reservations. ? Feet ? The ? feet ? (figs. 201-206), on the contrary, are a category of objects whose function is difficult to reconstruct. Their name derives solely from their resemblance to the shape of a human foot. The two wooden examples unearthed so far come from the Period II filling of room LVIII. The first example has a fairly pointed contour, rounded back, and flat base, and is completely smoothed over its entire surface (figs. 201, 202). The second ? foot ? is identical in shape but slightly smaller (figs. 203-204). Neither of the wooden ? feet ? bear traces of perforations or incisions on their surface. Initially it appeared likely that these were shapes for vamps or at any rate implements that were in some way associable to shoe making. Later, an identically shaped object made out of clay was found in room XIX again in a Period II level (figs. 205, 206). The fragility of unbaked clay makes it highly improbable that this ? foot ? was ever used for shoe making. As we are of the opinion that the identical shape of the two types of ? feet ? should be linked to an identical function, a hypothesis of this sort, which was in any case somewhat over-simple, must be excluded. Up till now we have not succeeded in associating the clay and wooden ? feet ? with any other similar object found in excavations in South Western Asia, whose publications are (54) J. M. Casal, Fouilles de Atnri, II, Paris, 1964, figs. 125, 1-3. 364</page><page sequence="157">known to us. Probably, as we have already affirmed at the beginning of this chapter, collabora? tion with ethnologists or iconographic comparisons will assist us in setting up a series of comparisons with the less technically advanced Asian cultures, in the near future, so as to succeed in exactly identifying the functions of this curious category. Wooden Boxes As we have already pointed out in a previous chapter (pp. 322, 358), square pottery boxes have been found quite frequently in the excavations of the Indo-Iranian Borderland and make up a highly uniform category of objects. They range in size from 10 to 20 cm. per side and are sometimes divided into compartments. The outer surface is often decorated with painted, almost exclusively stepped geometrical patterns. The stepped motif decora? tion on the 10 fragments of terracotta boxes found at Namazga and Altyn Tepe was not painted but deeply incised into the unhardened clay (fig. 127). At Shahr-i Sokhta, a trapezoidal wooden tablet with its edges cut into a stepped shape was brought to light in room LIX, belonging to Period III (fig. 126). This little object, measuring 7X3 cm., has a small hole (diam. 0.3 cm.) just above the edge of its base (on the left in the photograph) which was probably produced by a metal nail. Our hypothesis is that this is the fragment of a wooden box that was built by inlaying a series of these stepped elements. If this is so, the designs that were painted or engraved on the pottery boxes would be an imitation of the play of lines of the inlaid stepped elements. This would consequently explain the abundance of stepped motifs in the decoration of the pottery boxes, two particularly representative examples of which are the polychrome fragment presented in this report (fig. 125) and the fragment from the Period IV, 1 levels of Mundigak (fig. 128). Combs The combs found are of two types: rectangular with a crescent-shaped top and square. The rectangular combs (figs. 207, 208) are characterized by two pointed apexes on their upper edge, which give them their characteristic crescent shape. Their average measure? ment is 6 X 5 cm. and they have from 20 to 30 teeth, 2 cm. long. This type of comb has often been reproduced in the Buff Ware geometric designs (fig. 209), which would suggest that they were commonly and diffusely employed. The square combs (figs. 210-212), on the contrary, have a straight top and average measurements of 6 X 4 cm., with 15-20 teeth, 2.50 cm. long. In all the examples discovered so far, the upper half is decorated with a series of engraved parallel horizontal lines, varying from a minimum of 2 (fig. 212) to a maximum of 6 (fig. 210). The only possible comparison with similar cultural horizons would be with a wooden, double-toothed comb found by A. Stein in the cairn burial 2 excavated at Suntsar, Bampur, 365</page><page sequence="158">associated by C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky with the Bampur V Period (55). This comb has the only untoothed side that has preserved its convex contour. However, the Suntsar comb is of a different type and has been considerably embellished by an engraved geometric decoration, so that it is impossible to draw any conclusions from this comparison. We are inclined to believe that the structural differences between the rectangular and square combs correspond to different employment requirements. The square combs, in parti? cular, are much more solid than the crescent-shaped ones; while the parallel horizontal incisions make it much easier to hold them. The possibility that they were weaving imple? ments used for compressing fibres is thus not to be excluded. Combs of this type are still widely used today in various regions of Asia where very rudimentary weaving methods are adopted. Weaving Tools Here is a brief description of other objects that are possibly also to be connected with weaving: a) a spatula, 30 cm. long, with a circular head and semicircular section (fig. 216); this was probably a shuttle for inserting the weft-thread between the threads of the warp; b) a conical whorl (h. 3 cm., max. diam. 4 cm., hole w. 1 cm.) (fig. 217); c) finally, a small cone-shaped object with convex sides (h. 2.60 cm., max. diam. 4 cm.) crossed by a hole (w. 1.50 cm.) in which a small stick with a circular section was found inserted (fig. 218). The association of the last two objects with weaving is perhaps questionable, but the reader should bear in mind that the identification of nearly all the wooden objects found is to be considered merely provisional. Minor Objects The following is a list of other wooden objects whose function is completely obscure: ? a trapezium with elongated ends and sloping sides, 24 X 17 cm. (figs. 199, 200); ? a stick shaped like a cone, with cylindrical handle, 9X3 cm. (fig. 214); ? a shaped stick with the form of two elongated superimposed cones, 18 X 5 cm. (fig. 213); ? a small stick with a circular section and a filiform appendix in the centre of one of its ends, 8 X 1 cm. (fig. 215); ? a decorative (?) element composed of a spatula with tongue, resting on a pair of small semicircular discs, joined together by means of a central pin, 7 X 2.50 cm. (fig. 219); (55) A. Stein, Archaeological Reconnaissance in North-Western India and South Eastern Iran, Lon? don, 1937, p. 72, pi X (Suntsar 2); D. Schmandt, C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, A Re-evaluation of the Bampur, Khurab and Chah Husseini Collection in the Peabody Museum, forthcoming publication. 366</page><page sequence="159">? a laurel-shaped tongue with a small tang with a rectangular section, 8X2 cm. (fig. 194); ? the fragment of a stick with a circular head, rather crudely carved, 5.50 X 2 cm. (fig. 220). A carved animal's head is the only wooden object found so far that is perhaps not direct? ly linked to a specific use (fig. 193). It is difficult to establish with any accuracy what kind of animal it is intended to represent. The head is fairly elongated and has a rectangular sec? tion; two circular eyes are carved in the sides, while the cylindrical neck, which has the same length as the head (3.3 cm.) is joined at a 40? angle. The base of the neck was cut in such a way as to leave a tenon in the middle, 1 cm. long, that was probably used to attach the wooden head to a clay or wooden body. In conclusion, it would appear that wood-working in Shahr-i Sokhta was diffused and specialized, but not particularly linked to artistic expression. The elaborate and complex inlay techniques that were to give rise to an exceptionally high level of artistic production over much of Asia in the 1st millennium B.C., are not to be found there. Stone-working Stone Vessels, Objects and Implements The study of the ancient proto-urban civilization of Shahr-i Sokhta has raised an enor? mous number of problems that we have striven to express in this preliminary report. A process of urbanization may, in its highest phases, be identified with the rise of a series of crafts that are not directly concerned in the production of goods of primary impor? tance such as agricultural products or livestock, and that foreshadow the development of more sophisticated products, in the growing need for consumer goods. In Western Asia, during the 3rd millennium B.C., there was a constant dialectic between the great fertile alluvial plains, soon to be enriched by crops and herds, and the mountainous highlands surrounding them, often rich in timber and mineral resources. The most ancient Mesopotamian texts bear witness of the continuous need of the Sumerians for raw mate tials, totally absent in the flat plain. In this brief chapter we will try to introduce the problem of stone-working in Shahr-i Sokhta (56). The material assembled is already sufficiently vast to enable us to identify stone working as one of the main not directly productive activities of prehistoric Sistan. Later on in our research we may perhaps be able to connect stone-working in Shahr-i Sokhta with the (56) As to Shahr-i Sokhta's lithic industry, the new excavation has merely led to an increase in the quantity of material already in our possession. The study of the lithic complex calls for an ac? curate and global analytical examination of the numerous pieces found. The reader should thus refer to the previous preliminary report for general information on the groups of implements, and tc the brief introductory study on the toothed im? plements by G. M. Bulgarelli and M. Piperno, soon to be published, for data on the methodology being used. 367</page><page sequence="160">wider problem of the trade in semi-precious stones between Sumer and the distant eastern territories, the centres of the production of lapis lazuli, cornelian, turquoise, alabaster, green chalcedony, etc. From the geographical aspect, Sist?n has an undeniable advantage over Mesopotamia. The course of the Hilmand, with its extensive delta, is closed by a narrow chain of moun? tains, the Kuch?s, which are spread in a N-S direction and represent the sole orographic inter? ruption of the huge expanse of the three great Iranian deserts: the Dasht-i Khevir, the Dasht-i L?t and the Dasht-i Margo. During the region's more recent geological history, the water erosion of the eastern slope of the Kuch?s has caused the gradual disintegration of its rocks. Carried by the alluvial variations of the lake and delta, the rocky debris slowly ac? cumulated in a 40 X 1 km. band running parallel to the eastern slope of the mountain chain and marking the transition from the alluvial plain of the Hilmand to the rocky highland (57). Most of the rounded pebbles that are to be found within the strip are composed of recently formed (tertiary) and archaic (Mesozoic) effusive rocks: flint, basalt, porphyry, serpentine, alabaster and various types of limestone. On looking at the eastern slope of the Kuch?s in the early hours of the morning it is possible to make out the layers of quartzite ? veritable quarries of alabaster ? even from afar, thanks to their dazzling whiteness. The ancient inhabitants of Sist?n thus had an abundance of semi-precious stones availa? ble to them, which enabled the extremely rich production of stone vessels that was a feature of all the different periods of life in Shahr-i Sokhta. We have already had occasion, in the previous introduction to our research on the pro? tohistory of Sist?n, to give a full description of the different types of stone vessels, together with a number of probable tools for working them, that were found on the surface of the 1967 excavation (5S). The 1968 campaign has supplied us with still further material, so that our present task is that of assembling the data in our possession concerning production techniques and the typology of the forms produced. Only one region of ancient Western Asia presents an equally rich documentation of alabaster vases: Egypt, where production reached its zenith during the protodynastic period. It is not unlikely that the techniques adopted by the Egyptian stone-cutters were not so different from those of their contemporaries in Eastern Ir?n, since the crystalline structure of alabaster, like that of many other stones, considerably limits the potential cutting and finishing techniques. In his study of the technology of ancient Egypt, A. Lucas connects the production of stone vessels with the use of the flint crank borer and the crescent-headed borer (59). Some tomb paintings show some of the phases in the working of stone vessels and demonstrate that in order to increase the drill's pressure on the stone and to accelerate the rate of production, a certain number of weights and counterweights were used at the height of the handle (60).

Caldwell relates it to a drilling model as it appears in a Saqq?rah tomb painting of the fifth Dynasty (61). After being roughly shaped with blows from a lithic hammer and a bronze chisel, the recipients were finished with small-headed chisels and finally smoothed over and made trans? lucent with various systems (62). The stones that were most widely used in protodynastic Egypt have also been recognized in Sist?n: alabaster, basalt, breccia, granite, limestone, porphyritic rock, diorite, mudstone, serpentine and steatite (63). Alabaster is by far the most widely found stone in Shahr-i Sokhta, while there are only three examples of steatite: an undecorated hemispherical bowl with a slightly inflected contour, a minute jar with a cube shaped body, decorated with little inserted discs of alabaster (64), a small cylindrical bowl, decorated with a motif of lions alternating with tiny stylized palms in relief (fig. 42 d). The latter would appear, on the basis of comparative evidence, to originate from more western centres or the Persian Gulf (65). We are able to document much of the technique used in working Shahr-i Sokhta's stone vessels. Several unfinished forms have in fact been found that show the impressions made by the preparatory chisel strokes and the drilling that had only just been begun (figs. 221, 222). The chisel strokes were made in a downwards direction and the impressions correspond to the tip of a chisel found during the previous campaign (fig. 223). This technique has been reconstructed for the Egyptian stone vessels by H. Bonnet after an attentive examination of the traces left by the implements adopted. According to Lucas, the implement used was the weighted crank drill which appears in frequent representations on various reliefs of the 5th, 6th, 12th, 18th and 26th Dynasties at Saqq?rah, Deir Gebrawi, Meir and Thebes. The heads of the drills found are of the hammer type and were made of various types of stone ? chert, diorite, flint, limestone, quartzite and sandstone. The half-moon-headed flint drills were identified by J. Ph. Lauer and F. Debono and were probably in use in protodynastic times, since, on the basis of the marks that could be seen on the fragments of the vessels examined, Bonnet asserted that two different types of drill had been employed (66).

In the predynastic site of Qasr es-S?ghah in particular, apart from the wooden crescents, at least one unfinished alabaster vase has been found. S. M. Puglisi, ?

The grinding action was probably increased by the dust produced by drilling, or, more simply, with water. The production technique met with a very definite limit: only unrestricted shapes could be made, because the drill could not be introduced and operated in the tiny mouths of the restricted shapes. It seems, however, that the Shahr-i Sokhta craftsmen discovered a simple system for making small restricted jars: a fragment found in room XLI of Period III, is a clear enough demonstration (figs. 224, 225). The recipient was made in two separate pieces ? body and base, on the one hand; rim, neck and shoulder, on the other ? so that both parts appeared unrestricted and could be drilled. The two halves, whose adhe? sion round the join had been increased by a series of notches, were subsequently stuck to? gether with a resinous glue. Most of the vessels and fragments unearthed have unrestricted shapes that can be sum? med up as follows: ? truncated-cone-shaped (figs. 40 a-d, 226) ? hemispherical (figs. 40 e, f, 227) ? cylindrical with straight rim ? cylindrical with flat everted rim (fig. 228) ? sub-conical with straight rim (figs. 40 g, 229) ? sub-conical with flat jutting rim (fig. 40 h, i) ? convex cylindrical, or mortars (figs. 40 j, 230-232) ? goblets (fig. 233) ? cubic with truncated-cone neck (figs. 42 c, 234, 235) None of these forms has a corner point where there is a sharp change in contour. The walls are nearly always straight and completely smooth, although simple line motifs, more or less deeply incised, are not infrequent. The vessel sizes vary considerably: ranging from tiny forms (h. 2 cm.; diam. 3 cm.) to larger ones, all reconstructed from sherds, sometimes reaching a diameter of 35 cm. The alabaster vases, that were produced in such large quantities in Shahr-i Sokhta, have also been found in many surrounding regions. From Tal-i Iblls comes the fragment already referred to; a considerable number of small vessels and fragments have been found in Mundigak and Damb Sadaat (67); while the ones that have come to light in the urban centres of southern Turkmenia are particularly significant. At least 8 fragments published by V. I. Sarianidi come from Geoksjur 1-4 (Namazga III Period) (68). The working of alabaster and other stones was not limited to the production of stone (67) Casal, op. cit. (1961), II, fig. 134, pi. XXXVIII c; Fairservis, op. cit., p. 34, a-h. (68) Sarianidi, op. cit. (1965), pi. XII, figs. 57-64. 370</page><page sequence="163">vessels, but probably also served to satisfy part of the population's need for tools. Our documentation in this sector is still fragmentary and insignificant, but we are already able to present a number of fairly interesting implements. The use of looms undoubtedly called for the use of weights, which we feel may be identified in a series of disc-shaped objects thai are fairly heavy (300 gr. each on average) and perforated in the centre (figs. 236, 237). They are shaped like small wheels with a truncated-cone-shaped contour and a diameter varying in size between 4 and 10 cm. It is not to be excluded, moreover, that we have before us examples of real, universally used weights: the way in which they are made appears, in fact, too accurate for them to be implements serving as counterweights to the weft of a fabric during manufacture. Anyway more detailed researches on this specific subject are going to be undertaken in the nearest future. More evidently to be connected with weaving are the spindle-whorls: small clay or stone discs, perforated in the centre and with a diameter never exceeding 6 cm. in size (fig. 41). They were often derived from suitably rounded off fragments of alabaster or pottery vessels. In particular, the bases of the Buff Ware pear-shaped beakers appear to have been especially suitable for this use. Alabaster and other siliceous stones were widely adopted for the production of the most varied objects: spherical balls (fig. 240), cylindrical convex reels (fig. 238), pestles (fig. 239). But two types of alabaster objects call for brief special attention: spheroid mace heads and a punch handle. The spheroid mace heads (figs. 241, 242) have been frequently found throughout South Western Asian settlements of the 3rd millennium B.C. The ex? amples found in Shahr-i Sokhta have the shape of a sphere squashed at the poles, with an average diameter of 10 cm. and a hole measuring roughly 3 cm. All the examples carry traces of splintering and stains probably due to use. Since alabaster is a relatively soft material, however, the implements under examination were extremely delicate and could be easily broken. The punch handle is actually a little sculptural masterpiece (figs. 243, 244). It is a perfect reproduction of a sheep's metarcarpus, down to its smallest details. This bone was in fact generally used as a punch and a considerable number of these imple? ments has been found up to now in Shahr-i Sokhta, as well as in all the other centres of the Indo-Iranian Borderland (fig. 245). With our alabaster example, we have before us a reproduction of the more common bone punch, that may have been part of a more sophis? ticated implement, composed of the alabaster handle we have just described and the metal point that was attached to it. Semi-precious Stones and Microdrilling Techniques A squat biconical Buff Ware jar, containing a deposit of various semi-worked stones and gem-cutting tools (fig. 246), was found buried in the most ancient floor (Period Ha) of room CI (RYL, 13). 371</page><page sequence="164">The jar, 12 cm. high, was decorated with a continuous frieze along its neck and shoulder, composed of a chain of triangles. Its interior was full of dust, clots of clay and about a hundred tiny objects. All this is of the utmost importance for the reconstruction of the micro-drilling technique used to work necklace beads with a bow-drill. The vessel (fig. 247) had been sealed completely with a block of clay that has preserved the perish? able contents from deterioration. Three pieces of cane (fig. 248), about 12 cm. long with a diameter of 2 cm., served as containers for fragments of semi-precious stones that had been roughly shaped or were ready for drilling. The first piece of cane contained 7 cylindrical beads of lapis lazuli, with a diameter of about 0.4 cm., that had not yet been perfora ted but were already completely smoothed over (fig. 249). The second container on the contrary, held 35 chips of cornelian, cut into rectangular facets with contours that were still irregular (fig. 251); while the third was filled with 10 splinters of green chalcedony with touched up edges (fig. 250). Apart from the three pieces of cane described above, the vessel contained chips and fragments of other stones, a complete list of which follows: 1-5) Fragments of alabaster pebbles, cut on one or two sides. Squared off. 6-9) Chips of orange-coloured alabaster; with cortex. 10) Small oblong alabaster pebble. 11-16) Chips of chalcedony. 17) Split basalt pebble. 18) Fragment of rock crystal, prism cut, polygonal. 19) Rock-crystal fragment, pyramidal-shaped. 20-24) Small pebbles of porphyritic rock. 25-26) Tiny chips of white crystalline mineral. 27) Very slender pebble of grey-brown sandstone, with light parallel furrows on each side. Polisher (?). 28) Fragment of a stamp-seal in potstone, of the superimposed cross type, with two symmetrical holes passing through (2X1 cm.) (fig. 258 d). 29) Fragment of a small perforated basalt plaque (fig. 258 c). 30) Ovoidal alabaster necklace bead, imperfectly polished and with the beginning of a perforation on both apexes (2.4 X 1.5 cm.) (fig. 258 a). 31) Fragment of a truncated conical alabaster necklace bead, split along the central bore (1.3 X 0.8 cm.) (fig. 258 e). 32) Tiny fragment of steatite seal with trace of incised line (0.7 X 0.2 cm.). 33) Fragment of truncated-cone-shaped necklace bead made of chalcedony, split long? ways at the beginning of the perforation (fig. 258 b). 372</page><page sequence="165">The rest of the objects contained in the jar were perhaps more directly linked with the tools belonging to a gem-cutter. A pear-shaped basalt pebble, slightly splintered at one end, may have been used as a hammer {fig. 252), while two other cigar-shaped pebbles, with a characteristic rough sur? face, probably served as polishers (fig. 253). The most interesting find as regards the reconstruction of the technique used for drilling the beads, however, is that of 6 rectangular wooden tablets, bored in the centre by a series of holes with different diameters (fig. 257 a-f). These were obviously supports for the beads during drilling. The necklace bead was placed in the hole corresponding to its diameter so that it remained immobile and the craftsman could proceed to drilling. We have thus been able to reconstruct almost the entire process of working the neck? lace beads. First and foremost, the bow-drill: this was composed of a wooden shaft held perpendicular thanks to a stone handle while the bow-string wound round it made it rotate at every movement of the hand. Attached to the lower end of the shaft was a stone tip ? flint, quartzite, porphyry ? that bored into the necklace bead, held firm by the wooden tablet. The stone handles were identified for the first time by J. M. Casal (69) in a series of cone-shaped objects with a straight or button-shaped apex and hollow base (figs. 41 a, 254). These objects were made with different types of stone ? serpentine (figs. 41 c, d, 255, 256), alabaster (fig. 41 a, b), gray sandstone (fig. 41 e) ? a considerable number of which have been found in Shahr-i Sokhta. The drill heads, that have already been described in the previous preliminary report, also represent a fairly common find. The buried deposit, the large number of drill heads and handles, the presence of lapis lazuli, cornelian, turquoise and green chalcedony ? greater in the wasters than in the finished pieces (less than 10%) ? all this seems to be evidence that the city was a centre for the working of semi-precious stones and the production of necklace beads and other decorative elements. The drilling technique had been perfectly mastered by the ancient craftsmen of Shahr-i Sokhta; as we shall see shortly, this was the only system adopted for the manufacture of steatite stamp-seals. Beads We shall now make a brief examination of the types of necklace beads that were produced by this technique of carving, grinding and drilling. Fig. 259 shows a fair number of the examples found. The commonest forms are: cylindrical, cigar-shaped, lens-shaped, lozenge-shaped, disc-shaped. The principal forms observed in alabaster beads are: cylindrical, lens-shaped and loz? enge-shaped. The cornelian beads, on the other hand, present two shapes that had not been (69) Casal, op. cit. (1961), II, fig. 135, 11-lle. 373</page><page sequence="166">noted hitherto in beads of less valuable stone: the truncated-conical and the biconical shapes (fig. 260). Rock-crystal seems to have been used almost exclusively for making small drop-shaped pendants, bored through the apex (fig. 261). This stone was particularly difficult to work and it is thus not improbable that a limited use was made of it, although rock-crystal is not an infrequent find in the quartz strata of the Kuch? mountains. Trade in semi-precious stones played an essential role, as we have already had occa? sion to recall, in the network of economic and cultural relations that was gradually devel? oping in South Western Asia during the 3rd millennium B.C. G. Herrmann's recent exhaustive study on lapis lazuli trade from its origins to the 1st millennium B.C. has brought the whole of the vast problem related to the stone's sources and transportation routes up to date in an exemplary manner (70). The British scholar has identified Badakhsh?n, the vast mountainous region comprising practically the whole North-East section of what is now Afghanistan as the main lapis lazuli mining centre of ancient times. Communications between this part of the plateau and Sist?n appear very easy, since they are facilitated for three quarters of the way by the course of the Hilmand. The cultural identity of Shahr-i Sokhta I-III and Mundigak III-IV leads us to frame the hypothesis that there was a common political control over the two centres, or over the whole of the middle and lower course of the Hilmand. Not having learnt the results of our research, G. Herrmann had rejected the possibility of a trade route along the Hilmand, at the time when her article was published (although she does not appear to have ex? cluded this theory when writing her thesis). We feel it is no longer possible to refuse to consider the Hilmand as an extremely interesting route linking East and West, if for no other reason than the existence of these extensive proto-urban centres scattered along its banks, and the most recent historical evidence (71). Although over 1000 km. away from Badakhsh?n, Shahr-i Sokhta must certainly have been an important centre for the production of semi-precious stones and particularly lapis lazuli. Cornelian and the other precious and semi-precious stones found raise different prob? lems from those of lapis lazuli, due to the large number of possible sources. With regard to cornelian, however, it is possible to affirm that even today numbers of little pebbles of this stone, with a diameter often exceeding 3 cm., may be collected along the dried out beds of the ancient branches of the delta. Thus it cannot be excluded that Sist?n itself was the source of the cornelian worked in Shahr-i Sokhta, at least to a certain extent. (70) Herrmann, op. cit.t pp. 53-54. (71) Bosworth, op. ciL, pp. 25-32. 374</page><page sequence="167">Seals The 1968 excavation has made further additions to our collection of seals. The ex~ cellent state of preservation of the archaeological deposit of Shahr-i Sokhta has moreover permitted us to unearth a considerable number of sealings that were applied to the jars' lids of unbaked clay. The material is so vast that a special publication will shortly be devoted to it. In the meantime, we will merely present some of the more significant examples and describe them briefly. Most of the seals found are made of steatite and copper; only a very limited number is in alabaster, lapis lazuli and pottery. The variations in design are probably connected with the technique used to work the specific material; we will consequently deal with stone and metal seals in different sections. Stone Seals The shape of the steatite seals (figs. 262-274) always reproduces a precise geometric figure: lozenges, rectangles, circles and squares account for nearly all the types represented. Although most of the examples found have straight contours, there are some cases in which the edge of the seal is toothed, with regularly spaced incisions (fig. 262). A supporting string was passed through two symmetrical holes drilled in the middle of the seal: in one example, a fragment of string has been preserved still in loco. The main carving technique used was microdrilling: a series of holes set side by side so as to form a continuous line (figs. 263, 265, 266, 269, 271, 273). The carved lines were however completed with some finishing touches probably applied with a pointed metal tool (figs. 264, 267). There are some cases, however, in which a wide incision, almost an intaglio, may have been the only system adopted (fig. 270). The size of the seals varies from 2 cm. in diameter, for the smaller examples, to over 10 cm. for the larger ones. The incised motifs are of the utmost simplicity: geometric lines intersecting to form stepped, multiple cross or inlaid patterns. The steatite seals, that were frequently broken, were often put to a second use, even if in fragments or at any rate reduced in size. In this case, the edges were smoothed down and two more holes were bored for the string handle (fig. 267). Alabaster was also used for making seals: these were smaller, however, and crudely incised with microdrilled holes that often did not even make up a uniform geometric motif (%. 275). Copper Seals The variety of the copper seals (fig. 276 a-f) appears to be much more pronounced than that of the stone seals. We have already described a series of the main types in our 375</page><page sequence="168">previous report (72): flowers, crosses, squares, crowns, circles. Our last excavation has brought no variations to this scheme: all the seals fall under the above-mentioned catego? ries and have a curved ribbon eyelet in the middle of the upper part. The printing face is prepared with geometric and naturalistic motifs in which considerable use is made of the curved line (fig. 276 d, e). Seal Impressions The main evidence on the typology and use of the stamp seals, however, comes to us not from the actual seals, but from their impressions, found in great quantity and in an excellent state of preservation in the fillings of the second and third Periods. Many of them were produced by seals that have not yet been brought to light. The seal was impressed on the fresh clay laid on top of the mouth of a jar that had previously been stopped up with a piece of material and hide tied to the recipient with a piece of rope. The clay lid was stamped several times (figs. 277-280) and not infrequently with seals of a different type. Fig. 281 shows a sealing with the impression of a square seal beside that of a rectangular one; while on another fragment, the impressions of another rectangular seal are coupled with those of a cross-shaped one (fig. 282). Among the impres? sions corresponding to types also known in the original, there are abundant examples of squarebodied crosses (figs. 277, 278), circles hatched with multiple crosses (fig. 279), rec? tangles with stepped motifs (fig. 280), etc. The greatest interest obviously centres round the sealings that do not correspond to the seals that have been brought to light. One of these is made by a seal decorated with a com? position of alternating crosses and concentric circles (fig. 283); the latter were probably produced by a drill with a circular grooved head, as is shown by a small fragment of a circular seal found on the surface of the tepe (fig. 284). Apart from this, other significant impressions include those of two circular seals ? one with toothed outlines (fig. 285) and the other with a complicated inlaid linear motif, distributed on four quadrants (fig. 287) ? and the impression of a square seal divided into three parallel rectangles and decorated with simple meander motifs (fig. 286). All these sealings were probably obtained with steatite seals. The same may not, however, be said for another group of sealings, carrying extremely original naturalistic representations. The type of the impressions and the very nature of the subjects, that have never appeared among the several hundreds of original stone and bronze seals discovered up to now, lead us to believe that they are the work of pottery seals, a variety that has not as yet been found in the original. Two of these sealings represent a humped ox, turned towards the right, with a huge eye, facing frontwards, and a body decorated with stepped lines (figs. 288, 289). (72) Tosi, op. cit.y pp. 60-62; figs. 96, 99-106. 376</page><page sequence="169">A third sealing, made with two impressions of a fish-shaped seal, is particularly fine. The animal is very vividly represented, with an ogival body, upper and lower fin, double line of scales along the body and small round eye (fig. 290). Each fish measures 3X2 cm. A third type of naturalistic seal has been made out on two sealings, each bearing the same impression (figs. 291, 292), which reproduces a human head with large round eyes above a long mouth reduced to a thin horizontal line. The head is square-shaped, with a kind of toothed crown round it, extending below the ears, which are stylized as two elon? gated cones placed below the crown on either side of the head. Under the chin hangs a sheaf of four parallel vertical lines, possibly reproducing the stylized form of an article of clothing or necklace. This human representation is undoubtedly disconcerting, as it appears to be a fairly faithful copy of the appearance of the so-called terracotta figurines, known as ? mother goddess of Zhob ? and described as ? grinning skulls ? by S. Piggott (73). A detailed typological examination of the stone and bronze seals and their impressions on the sealings will be undertaken in a special monograph at the end of the third excava? tion campaign. The geographical distribution of the types identified will evidently depend on this preparatory work. We feel however that some remarks of a general character would be appropriate. ? Compartmented Seals ? The Indo-Iranian Borderland, from the eastern buttresses of Bal?chist?n up to South? ern Turkmenia and the eastern slopes of the Elburz mountains (Hiss?r I-III), seems to have been characterized by the use of this type of stamp seal, called ? compartmented seals ? by S. Piggot (74). This definition is too generical and cannot include the several hundreds of seals brought to light in the excavations made during the last twenty years. Never? theless, we feel it can still be employed, not only because it has long been adopted by most scholars, but also because in a certain sense it illustrates the feeling roused by this type of seal in the observer, quite effectively. In reality, the expression ? compartmented ? seals ? is much better suited to bronze seals than to steatite ones; we have however pre? ferred to use it for both types, since the main differences between the two categories seem rather to be a reflection of the differences in the material employed. The cultural sequence of Tepe Hiss?r shall be temporarily left aside, since it is being subjected to radical revision at the moment (75). Once again, both types and production techniques correspond to those of Mundigak III and IV (76), the bronze seals of Altin Tepe and Geoksjur 1-4 (Namazga III-IV Periods) of southern Turkmenia (77) and with the (73) S.

The compartmented seals, however, raise a very special chronological problem. In the Indus Valley they are only present as from the well-known cultural horizon of Jhukar, after the end of the Indus Civilization (81). In Amri, too, J. M. Casal brought to light a fragment of a circular compartmented seal in a level above the Amri II Period, identifiable with the Indus Civilization (82). The Shahi Tump stamp-seals, associated with Black-on Gray ware and a shaft-hole axe, have themselves been linked to the groups of men who participated in the destruction of Mohenjo Daro and contributed to the formation of the Jhukar Culture, characterized by gray monochrome pottery (83). The archaeological evidence seems to confirm the hypothesis that the cities that arose in the Hilmand and southern Turkmenia were anterior to the flourishing of the Indus Civilization. Although the period of Namazga V has recently been linked with Harapp? (84) by V. M. Masson on the basis of a number of finds ? fayence beads in particular ? we are more inclined to believe that when the most ancient cities of Sindh were prospering, the process of urbanization along the Hilmand was already dying out. In this case there would be a chronological gap between the compartmented seals (and the gray pottery) of Shahr-i Sokhta and that of Shahi Tump. Moreover, this gap cannot be explained by the numerous identical finds and the intermediate position of the centres of the Bampur valley, that may even have been a trait-d*union between Shahi Tump and Slst?n. The insufficient data in our possession at the present time do not permit us to make precise hypotheses on the subject, nor to pose the problem in its exact terms. Shahi Tump represents a southern outpost of the Hilmand Civilization, and could in this case have no relation to the birth of the Jhukar culture in Sindh; otherwise, situated in an outlying, isolated area, it could have preserved elements of Shahr-i Sokhta's material culture even after the latter's disap? pearance, later to diffuse them along the Indus, after the downfall of the Harapp? Civiliza? tion. This interesting problem will obviously only be solved when research at Shahi Tump is at last resumed. Metal working To conclude this description of the material evidence supplied by the finds from Shahr-i Sokhta, here is a brief description of the metal and bone objects found during the second excavation campaign. (78) These two copper seals, unpublished up to the present time, are preserved at the British Mu? seum, Dept. of Oriental Antiquities. I am grateful to the Deputy-keeper, Mr Douglas Barrett, for having always most kindly facilitated my research. The order no. of the Dabar Kot seal is 1939, 11 15-2, while the Rana Ghundai seal is part of the Martin Collection. (7S) De Cardi, op. cit., fig. 2. (80) A.

Pottery, bricks, bones and stone objects account for nearly all the material used by the ancient inhabitants to raise the floor level: objects, all of them, that had no more value for the people who threw them away in these fillings. Metal, on the contrary, could always be reused, by being melted down or moulded into new implements. This could be the explanation of the extreme scarcity of metal found up to now in Shahr-i Sokhta. In 1968 a series of really rather insignificant objects was unearthed, at least up to the present time. A possible lozenge-shaped spearhead with a long flat tang (fig. 293); a long pin with a circular section (fig. 294); another thick-bodied pin with circular section, deco? rated with at least two globules (fig. 295); the heel of a knife with flat ribbon-shaped tang (fig. 296); a short pin with a fin-shaped head (fig. 297); a small bar with tapered body and rectangular section (fig. 298). The metal employed is generally copper, with traces of various impurities. It is not improbable that these were actually copper-arsenic and copper-lead alloys (85). Bone Handicrafts The case of the bone implements is even simpler. Sheep metacarpuses and tibiae were widely used to make complete punches (fig. 299), spatulas (figs. 300, 301) or drill handles (fig. 302). An unfinished example of the latter has been found, with one end cut and the other merely prepared (fig. 303). The length of these small handles varies around 8 cm., but there are some examples that are barely 3 cm. long (fig. 304). Another example, 6 cm. long, was found with a pointed bone splinter still inserted (fig. 305). Thus it is evident that the tips of the hafted punches were not made exclusively of ? noble ? metal, but also consisted in mere splinters of bone and perhaps wood or flint. The Period I layer of trench RYL provided the most interesting piece of worked bone: the fragment of a rectangular plaque pierced all over with symmetrical slices (fig. 306). The whole piece must have been very small (5 X 3 cm.), but is the only example of finely worked bone found in Shahr-i Sokhta. CONCLUSIONS The first and most important question that should be asked at the end of this brief presentation of the results obtained from the second excavation campaign is, what was Shahr-i Sokhta at each of the different phases in its history? In other words: what factors (85) C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, ? Archaeology and Metallurgical Technology in Prehistoric Afgha nistan, India and Pakistan?, American Anthro? pologist, 69, 2, 1967, pp. 145-162. 379</page><page sequence="172">led to its birth; how this complex cultural entity developed and to what degree it was influenced by the special environmental conditions of the Hilmand Valley; what was its direct and indirect sphere of action; what role it played in the process of civilization east of Sumer and what position it held in the complex network of trade relations that began to link together far distant regions of Asia during the 3rd millennium B.C. These, in short, are the questions that can give a more precise meaning to our research and must be borne constantly in mind. During the 3rd millennium B.C., Shahr-i Sokhta became one of the largest settlements in the whole of the Indo-Iranian Borderland, owing at least in part to its favourable geo? graphic and ecological position. The size of the settlement and the complexity of the material culture brought to light prove that this was a real town, characterized by a high concentration of population and productive effort. Apart from agriculture, whose existence can merely be conjectured, stock-raising seems to have played an important role. The arti? ficial fillings described in full in the first part of this report have provided us with an enormous amount of animal bones, which are being worked on by the Italian Institute of Human Palaeontology. The abundant supply of water from the Hilmand and the slight climatic differences between Sist?n and the Kandahar Valley, 450 km. further up, have throughout the entire history of the region been an important factor in facilitating the formation of rich crops and herds. Moreover, the evidence provided by the hundreds of clay and terracotta models of cattle that have been collected during both our excavation campaigns can only be a further confirmation of these considerations. Stone-working represents a fairly clear proof of the existence of not directly produc? tive activities that were already partially indu strialized: an indication of #n urbanization process that had already reached an advanced stage. As yet another proof of this affirma? tion, mention could be made of the considerable standardization of types characterizing both pottery, the lithic industry and all the other artefacts: a few specially selected types were always produced on an extremely large scale. The Hilmand Valley may therefore by considered as the cradle of this civilization of the 3rd millennium B.C., but an observation of this type does not solve all the problems raised. Mundigak III-IV in the North-East and Bam pur I-IV in the South-West were probably expressions of the same historical phenomenon: the identity of much of their material culture, in fact, connects them both directly to the same cultural process. On the other hand, more distant localities such as Shahi Tump in Makr?n and the Quetta Valley in Bal?chist?n, only reveal a partial convergence and may have represented outlying areas of urbanization in relation to the Hilmand Valley. As to the factors leading to the birth of Shahr-i Sokhta and its main trade relations network, the most interesting considerations are raised by comparing the town with the proto-urban centres of Southern Turkmenia. Here we are in the presence of a precise cultural sequence that, within the limits of the periods established for these centres, 380</page><page sequence="173">covers a time span of over three thousand years: from the ancient Neolithic Age (8e) up to the end of an extremely rich urban civilization whose most majestically imposing remains are those of Namazga (70 hectares) or Altin Tepe (50 hectares). In our examination of the single elements of the material culture that have in turn been described, we have made frequent reference to the identity of the finds made in the two regions. This phenomenon may be observed in the most characteristic features of a material culture: pottery form and decoration, clay figurines, seals, necklace beads, clay boxes. From the chronological aspect, this convergence is more frequent in the more ancient phases of the urbanization process; this becomes particularly significant when related to a ? provincialization ? of processes that originated from a single impulse and not dissimilar environments. The following is thus a preliminary attempt to establish a comparative scheme by linking the civilizations of Na? mazga, Mundigak and Quetta with that of Shahr-i Sokhta, purely on the basis of conver gencies noted in the finds and without any precise chronological reference. Namazga Shahr-i Sokhta Mundigak Quetta VI ? ? ? V III IV, 2-3 DS III IV II IV, 1 DS II III I III DS I/KGM IV II I II KGM II-III I KGM I At the present stage of research, the organic unity and continuity of the Turkmenian sequence, its easy and unquestionable links with the Western Iranian plateau, that has been identified as one of the primary sources of the development of the neolithic revolution (87), give considerable plausibility to the hypothesis that identified Southern Turkestan as the centre from which the first impulses of civilization spread to the Indus and the Hilmand. Sarianidi is at present fairly favourable to a link-up between the formation of the Quetta culture (Damb Sadaat I-III) and impulses originating from the Geoksjur 10, 1 cul? ture, parallel to the Namazga I-III sequence (88). As regards the genesis of the Hilmand (86) V. M. Mas son, ?

Sarianidi on the south Turkmenian terracotta figurines has, moreover, shed light on the extremely interesting possibility of a process of diffusion of several writing symbols, as well as many other proto-urban elements, from Elam up to the Turkmenian steppe. The Soviet researchers have undoubtedly for some time now had a precise theory on the genesis of 381</page><page sequence="174">civilization, however, the problem may not be quite so simple; this is demonstrated by the recent discovery of a large neolithic settlement (Yahya VIII) at Tepe Yahy?, near Kirm?n, that is clearly a disturbing factor for a theory that identifies Turkmenia as the main centre of the most ancient process of cultural concentration and diffusion in the whole of this vast territory (89). Tepe Yahy? occupies a very precise position in the geography of South Western Asia, since it is at the end of the ? South road ? connecting Sist?n and the Indus to Mesopotamia, via the passes of the southern chains crossing Kirm?n, F?rs and Elam. We do not pretend either to solve or even, more simply, to delimit this vast series of problems, that undoubtedly calls for far more capillary documentation than is at present available to us. Our only aim is that of proposing a number of stimulating prospects. To return to Sist?n, we shall once again try to outline the region's historical features in the light of recent research in Shahr-i Sokhta. Future research will show whether or not the ecological environment in which Shahr-i Sokhta's first urban structure gradually developed was similar to that of southern Meso? potamia, but at the present time this seems improbable. The first human settlements in the latter area ? the farmers of the al-cUbeid period ? were built on the top of the dunes emerging from the extensive marsh that had gradually been formed by the accumulation of detritus at the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates. By means of suitable canalization, the men of the al-cUbeid culture slowly succeeded in controlling the flow of these rivers and cast the economic bases for the prodigious urban development of southern Mesopotamia in the 4th and 3rd millennia B.C. (90). In the case of Sist?n, there appears to have been a huge marsh, the H?m?n, which, despite the heavy evaporation that made it tend to shrink progressively, was constantly enriched by the frequent flooding of the Hilmand. The withdrawal of the lake and the sinking of its clayey bed, due to erosion by alluvial water in the delta zone, favoured the formation of well irrigated and easily defended dunes and plateaux. Moreover, the marsh not only favoured an abundant and permanent water supply but probably also a large hunt? ing-ground. Nevertheless, the fact remains that Sist?n was actually too far away from Elam and Mesopotamia for it to be possible to talk of a direct influence from these regions. Communica? tions, though possible, were certainly far from easy. We are of the opinion, moreover, that it is improbable that the cultural sequence in Sist?n, due to its characteristics as an alluvial region, originated with the proto-farming communities. It should, in fact, be the proto-urban culture of Turkmenia, which they associate with the Mesopotamia*! world, without however excluding the possibility of its participa? tion in the Indus Civilization's formation process.

Slst?n differs from the rest of Iran in the sense that it is neither a highland area with relatively abundant rainfall nor an oasis with rich springs, but part of an extensive river basin. Similarly to Mesopotamia, the most ancient manifestations of its history probably saw light in the surrounding foot-hill regions (92), whether Turkmenia, Kirm?n or Baluchistan itself. In Slst?n we are consequently seeking to read the more recent chapters of a story that probably began elsewhere but found in this region the land and water resources necessary for the fulfilment of a process of civilization that may have been of exceptional importance in the history of the Indo-Iranian Borderland, from the Turkestan steppes up to the Indus.
