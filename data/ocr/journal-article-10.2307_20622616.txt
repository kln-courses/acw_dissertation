One perspective, inspired from behavioral ecology, attempts to measure the fitness effects of religious practices. Another set of models, representative of evolutionary psy chology, explain religious thought and behavior as the output of cog nitive systems (e.g., animacy detection, social cognition, precautionary reasoning) that are not exclusive to the religious domain. In both per pectives, the question remains open, whether religious thought and behavior constitute an adaptation or a by-product of adaptive cognitive function. in</page><page sequence="2">INTRODUCTION Understanding religious thought and behav ior as consequences of human nature is an old project, perhaps as old as the systematic, reflec tive examination of belief in gods and spirits. . A notion of "natural religion" as the result of fun damental human propensities is familiar, for in stance, in both Western and Muslim traditions (Pailin 1984, Reinhart 1986). Understanding religion as a result of evolution by natural se lection is obviously a more recent research pro gram, even though the first rudiments of such a project can be found in Darwin himself (Darwin 1871). In the past 20 years, a number of psy chologists, anthropologists, religious scholars, and evolutionary biologists have put forward a new evolutionary perspective, understanding religion as one among the many domains of cul tural activity that were shaped by human evo lutionary history (Hinde 1999). THE RELIGIOUS DOMAIN What the term religion denotes is widely dis puted in contemporary anthropology and reli gious studies (Saler 1993), so it may be of help to start with a rough demarcation of the field of inquiry. Evolutionary models are supposed to explain a whole collection of behaviors and mental representations that are found in many different human groups, including the follow ing: mental representations of nonphysical agents, including ghosts, ancestors, spir its, gods, ghouls, witches, etc., and beliefs about the existence and features of these agents; artifacts associated with those mental rep resentations, such as statues, amulets, or other visual representations or symbols; ritual practices associated with stipulated nonphysical agents; moral intuitions as well as explicit moral understandings that people in a particular group connect to nonphysical agency; specific forms of experience intended to either bring about some proximity to 112 Boy er Bergstrom nonphysical agents or communicate with them; ethnic affiliation and coalitional processes linked to nonphysical agents; and evolutionary models, such as other ex planatory models in anthropology, as sume cross-cultural commonalities in each of these domains of thought and be havior. Does this collection of features constitute a domain of "religion"? As we demonstrate be low, the models described here do not assume that the features listed above are always found together. The only assumption is that evolution provides the context for understanding some or many of the phenomena listed. In this sense the term religion is to an evolutionary anthropolo gist what "tree" is to an evolutionary botanist, a common prescientific category that may need to be replaced with other, causally grounded, scientific categories. Are religious phenomena sui generis? A re lated but distinct question is whether "reli gious" is a specific property of the phenomena listed above, such that they would all differ from their "nonreligious" counterparts. For instance, is a religious ritual different from a nonreligious one, and religious morality intrinsically differ ent from the nonreligious kind? The models re viewed here make no strong assumption about that. Indeed, most of them lead to deflationary accounts of religion, in which the phenomena in question are explained in terms of processes that would operate in the same way in other contexts (Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990). In this sense, what explains religious thought or behavior may also explain many other domains of cultural thought and behavior (Saler 1993). This pits evolution ary models, like most other anthropological accounts, against classical assumptions in the study of religion, following which there is a spe cific quality of religious phenomena (thought, experience, emotion, etc.) that requires expla nation [see Eliade (1959), Otto (1959) and a discussion in Wiebe (1998)]. Are there religious universals? Some fea tures of religion may well constitute substantive cultural universals (Brown 1991). This however</page><page sequence="3">is not crucial to using evolutionary models, whose aim is to explain the variance observed in terms of some common factors. Thus explana tions should be sought for all cultural phenom ena whose recurrence is clearly above chance. In many domains, evolution resulted in disposi tions that render humans sensitive to particular contextual input, but evolved human disposi tions do not always result in uniform behaviors or cultural outputs. Was religion present in ancestral times? If religion, or at least the phenomena described above, were influenced by natural selection, we should expect at least some of these behaviors to be ancient as well as widespread. In the archae ological record, we find evidence for a variety of nonpragmatic behaviors, such as elaborate burial procedures, from the earliest stages of the Paleolithic and perhaps also in Neanderthals (Trinkaus &amp; Shipman 1993). Also, we find ev idence for supernatural concepts, chimeras for instance, from early stages of modern human cultures (Mithen 1999). Did these behaviors and concepts already constitute "religion"? The question only makes sense if we assume that "religion" stands for a natural kind, an inte grated package, which is probably not the case. More important, the archaeological evidence shows that many of the phenomena discussed here appear at the same point (about 50 kya) along with other phenomena typical of modern humans, such as regional "cultural" differences (Richerson &amp; Boyd 2006), sophisticated tool equipment (Mithen 1996), body ornamentation and make-up (Hovers et al. 2003), and probably the first musical instruments (Falk 2000). What was early "religion" like? There is no straightforward way of connecting inferred past practices to their modern equivalents, es pecially to the beliefs and experiences associated with religious thoughts. Some of the evidence, such as rock art similar to the visual phenom ena induced by trance and altered states of con sciousness (Pearson 2001), would point to a Paleolithic form of shamanism (Hayden 2003) and ecstatic experience (Dornan 2004). This would be consistent with a traditional assump tion made by religious scholars that shaman ism is the most archaic form of religious be havior (Eliade &amp; Trask 1964, Shirokogoroff 1935). However, such inferences are fraught with problems, as we discuss below (see Experi ence and Commitment). Cues to special experi ence do not necessarily indicate that such expe rience was interpreted in terms of nonphysical agency or that religious specialists like modern shamans existed. Most evolutionary approaches to religion actually eschew speculation on archaic forms of religious behavior and experience. Rather, a common strategy is to identify the capacities and behaviors universally involved in religious thought or behavior and to relate them to plau sible selective pressure. In this sense, evolution ary anthropologists of religion adopt the same strategy as other evolutionary behavioral scien tists do?that of measuring the contributions of various behaviors and behavioral strategies to fitness. EVOLUTIONARY BACKGROUND Genetic and Cultural Evolution The theoretical background to models of re ligion is a specific approach to cultural phe nomena and was developed in the past 20 years by evolutionarily inspired cultural anthro pologists (Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985, Durham 1991, Lumsden &amp; Wilson 1981, Sperber 1985). A common assumption among these differ ent, partly overlapping frameworks is that what we observe as cultural representations and practices are variants (of cultural traits), found in roughly similar forms in a particu lar place or group because they have resisted change and distortion through innumerable processes of acquisition, storage, inference, and communication. In these models, the spread of specific vari ants of cultural representations (such as a par ticular religious belief or concept represented by a human mind) is seen as partly analogous to the spread of alleles in a gene pool. In par ticular, the tools of population genetics can be applied to the spread of cultural traits and allow www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion 113</page><page sequence="4">us to predict their spread, given such parameters as the initial prevalence of a trait, the likeli hood of transmission, and various biases (Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985). Such models allow schol ars to describe formally the different possible connections between genetic evolution and cul tural transmission (Durham 1991). Particularly relevant to modeling the cultural transmission of religion are specific cognitive and behavioral biases that result from evolution, such as for instance a frequency bias (a general trend to ward cultural conformism) and a prestige bias (toward imitation of successful models) (Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985, 1996). Epidemiological models of cultural trans mission (Sperber 1985, 1996) also aim to de scribe a number of evolved biases that constrain cultural transmission. They focus specifically on a cognitive description of the communica tive processes involved in cultural learning, as well as the evidence for a host of specialized cognitive dispositions that canalize emergent representations and inferences. Human com munication never consists in the downloading of information among brains or in straight forward imitation of others' behavior. Rather, it consists in complex processes whereby peo ple build new mental representations as a re sult, among other causes, of information in ferred from other people's behavior and speech (Sperber 1996, 2000). This process is highly entropic?communication creates many differ ent representations in different minds?so that the existence of commonalities, of "cultural" in formation found in roughly similar versions in different minds, requires a special explanation (Sperber 1985). This is where cognitive dispo sitions are relevant. In many domains, people's representations are similar?despite exposure to nonidentical input?because their inferences are guided by tacit principles that happen to be identical in all normal minds (see Sperber &amp; Hirschfeld 2004 for more detail, and see Cognitive Turn, below, for an application to religion). In sum, genetic evolution produced a suite of psychological dispositions, typical of mod ern sapiens, that provides a vast amount of in 114 Boy er Bergstrom formation (mostly from conspecifics), but also creates dispositions for acquiring certain kinds of information. Evolutionary models do not as sume that acquiring more information from the environment implies less information specified in the genome. On the contrary, as compari son among species invariably confirm, acquir ing more information from the environment requires richer cognitive dispositions to ren der such information sensible, and therefore re quires more genetic specification. How does this perspective relate to ethno graphic evidence? In contrast with most mainstream cultural anthropology, but in par allel to linguistic anthropology or archaeology, evolutionary models of culture are crucially dependent on cross-cultural comparisons. A common strategy in the field consists in (a) identifying specific adaptive challenges encountered by Homo in its ancestral condi tions of evolutionary adaptation; (b) specifying information-processing mechanisms that could meet these challenges and accrue fitness benefits?on the basis of what is independendy established in experimental psychology, neu roscience, etc.; (c) designing new experimental protocols to establish or disconfirm the exis tence of these specific information-processing mechanisms; (d) specifying the kind of concepts and norms that would be widespread among humans, if these mechanisms operated as theo retically expected; and (e) testing the latter pre diction against the ethnographic record from scientific publications or databases. Obviously, this is a normative ideal and the distinct steps are often shufBed out of order in actual scien tific work. The main point, however, lies in the appeal to external, independently established models of mental functioning (step b, above). In this view, the concepts and norms specific to a given population of study are the outcome of the encounter between a unique history and the common dispositions of the species. Two Reductive Strategies All evolutionary models are reductive in the sense that they attempt to show that a number</page><page sequence="5">of variables account for a significant part of the variance in the cultural phenomena at hand. It is important at the outset to be specific about this reductive enterprise. In the social sci ences, the strategy of evolutionary modeling is often misconstrued as one of "just-so" story telling, that is, observing a particular human behavior and then producing a posthoc evo lutionary story whereby that particular behav ior could have been adaptive (Kurzban 2001). True, this ex post facto approach was typical of early applications of Darwinism to social phe nomena, including models of religious behav ior (Wilson 1975). For instance, Reynolds and colleagues collected comparative data on po tential fitness consequences of membership in different modern religious traditions (Reynolds &amp; Tanner 1983). Given that most religious sys tems include moral prescriptions about sexu ality, contraception, polygamy, and infanticide, one should expect some impact on reproduc tive potential. Despite this empirical ground ing, such studies were ultimately unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, fitness differences be tween historically evolving, recent traditions occur on such a short timescale that genetic evolution is an unlikely factor in accounting for these differences. Second, these studies could not address the more general question of the evolutionary background of religion, beyond cultural differences. The strategy of current evolutionary mod eling is to analyze natural function in terms that lead to nontrivial predictions that can then be tested against the evidence (Ketelaar &amp; Ellis 2000). Two main explanatory strategies have been developed in this direction. One consid ers cross-culturally recurrent features of reli gious behaviors ?nd their potential or actually measured effects on fitness. The other focuses on the evolved psychology that led to religious thought and behavior. Although both types of models hinge on the notion of evolved adap tations, they differ in the emphasis placed on proximate causation (if any) that is involved in such adaptations and the empirical conse quences (if any) that follow. The first strategy tries to proceed directly from religious behav ior to hypotheses about evolutionary processes that would have led to such phenomena. This is close to the general approach of early socio biology (Wilson 1975) and behavioral ecology (Krebs &amp; Davies 1984). Alternatively, religious behavior may be explained in terms of underly ing capacities or dispositions, which themselves are seen as outcomes of evolution. This is closer to the general approach in recent nonhuman so ciobiology (Kacelnik 2003) and in evolutionary psychology (Kirkpatrick 2006). Here, we dis cuss these two strategies. COST AND COMMITMENT Commitment and Signals A striking characteristic of most religious thought and behavior is that they do not seem to confer any direct fitness advantage on the practitioners. So, from an evolutionary view point, most religious phenomena might seem to be either maladaptive or adaptively neutral (Durham 1991). However, evolutionary biol ogy also documents specific ways in which fit ness costs can become adaptive. This is par ticularly so in the case of signaling, an area of intense work in recent evolutionary biology (Grafen 1990). Signaling requires the coevo lution of sender and receiver capacities (Rowe 1999). A central problem is the evolution of honest signals, which reliably inform an organ ism about qualities of others. In recent years, biologists have focused especially on cosdy sig nals, which are reliable because they are difficult to fake and thereby provide direct indices of the fitness qualities they are supposed to advertise (Zahavi &amp; Zahavi 1997). For example, gazelles advertise their strength and dexterity by stot ting (high-jumping) in front of a predator. The direct fitness cost of this relative vulnerability is offset if the predator chooses to redirect its at tention to less nimble prey. Under such specific conditions, cosdy signaling can become an evo lutionarily stable strategy (Grafen 1990). Some human cultural behaviors may also be described in these terms, as costly signals that provide ul timate fitness advantages. www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion 115</page><page sequence="6">Signals are especially important in intensely social species like humans, who can be said to live in the "cognitive niche" (Tooby &amp; DeVore 1987) , that is, to survive on information ex tracted from the natural and social environ ment. Information about conspecifics is cru cial to social exchange, especially information about their intentions and dispositions, because there are clear and immediate rewards for op portunistic defection, that is, for reaping the benefits of social exchange without paying its costs. So how could exchange and cooperation ever evolve? A number of capacities may be in volved. Reciprocal altruism, for instance, sim ply requires one to recall which individuals co operated and which defected, together with a disposition to return the favor (Trivers 1971). However, human cooperation goes much fur ther than that, and people often display costly, nonopportunistic behaviors. Humans are more altruistic than expected utility would predict. This disposition to cooperate is manifest in economic games (Smith 2003) and every day behaviors (Frank 1988). Why is that the case? Cooperation often requires that people sac rifice an immediate benefit for a delayed re ward, an arrangement that goes against the grain of evolved discounting strategies (Ainslie 2005, Rachlin 2006). A possible solution is to evolve a system of emotions that provide im mediate negative rewards (e.g., guilt) for op portunistic behaviors and positive ones (e.g., pride) for cooperation. However, these disposi tions are worthwhile only if they override ratio nal self-interest and are honestly signaled. This may be why some emotions and moral feelings associated with cooperation are neither ratio nal nor easy to conceal (Frank 1988). According to Frank, they constitute commitment devices whereby one ties one's own hands to signal a disposition to cooperate, thereby garnering the benefit of being seen as a reliable partner (Frank 1988) . Another possible factor is the evolution of "tribal instincts" (Richerson &amp; Boyd 2001). Hu mans are notable for their demonstration of strong reciprocity, typically within small ethno n6 Boy er Bergstrom linguistic groups or within modern nations that mimic the language of tribal affiliation (com mon ancestry territory, mores, etc.) (Gintis 2000,2003). The specific norms of the commu nity become the object of great emotional com mitment (Nichols 2002), and norm violations trigger punitive attitudes (Price et al. 2002). Modern humans may have evolved a propen sity to cooperate within groups that share com mon norms, a propensity that may have spread by group selection at the cultural, not genetic, level (Boyd &amp; Richerson 1990). This would provide the background against which sharing or other nonopportunistic dispositions natu rally develop in human beings. Religion as Signals Is religion a form of cosdy signaling? As one author has noted, "most religions are expressed in elaborate rituals that are cosdy in time and sometimes in other ways" (Irons 2001). Initia tion rites are generally painful, and many rites require expensive preparations. In a more gen eral way, religious thought and behavior would seem to mobilize cognitive resources away from survival and reproduction, being focused on nonphysical imagined agency. Assuming that religious activity is costly, does it provide sig nals? To a large extent it does, given that most activity of this kind is both public and formal ized, so that people's commitments to the lo cal ritual system are observable by all (Sosis 2003). On the basis of a comparative study of small communities, Sosis showed that cost is in deed an important factor. Religious groups that require a greater investment in cosdy rituals tend to remain more cohesive (Sosis &amp; Bressler 2003). This framework requires a significant change of perspective in our understanding of religious activity. First, it describes religion mostly in terms of communication rather than internal beliefs. What matters here is what peo ple demonstrate to others. Second, it suggests that internal states, beliefs, and emotions may be tools recruited in the development of such demonstrations, which is why this approach is</page><page sequence="7">best seen as a complement to commitment and strong reciprocity models. In its current formulation, the costly signal hypothesis suggests that religion is a straight forward adaptation. Dispositions to entertain religious thought and communicate them to others emerged because of their impact on fit ness (Bulbulia 2004), distinct from the notion that religious solidarity provides benefit to the group (Wilson 2002). Obviously, such a strong claim requires equally strong empirical evi dence, which in turn depends on more precise hypotheses. First, one must specify to what ex tent "religion" is actually costly and signaling, in the precise sense required by biological mod els (Cronk 2005). Second, the framework im plies that costly behaviors are the original ones, and noncostly ones are a by-product. This way of thinking might imply psychological predic tions, e.g., as to the relative impact of costly vs. noncostly practices on receiver psychology, on the mental states of potential believers. These models perhaps need to be supplemented with the psychological proximate causation that is currently missing. EXPERIENCE AND BELIEF What is the role of exceptional experience in the acquisition and transmission of religious concepts and behaviors? This is an old theme in the study of religion, which William James saw as foundational: people having such expe riences becoming inspired leaders or prophets (James 1902). Experience might be a powerful factor in the diffusion of religious belief because it provides undeniable subjective grounding to concepts and norms acquired from other peo ple. Diverse attempts have been made to re late evolutionary history and prehistory to a disposition for religious thought and behavior. However, one must first be specific about the range of "experience" considered relevant. Re ligious scholars sometimes extend the notion of "experience" to long-term processes of con version (Edwards &amp; Lowis 2001), whereas the anthropological or psychological understand ing of the term is narrower, denoting such phe nomena as trance, possession, and the feel ing of a supernatural presence (Argyle 1990, Boyatzis 2001). Although such experiences are very diverse, potential similarities include a loss of control, positive valence, benevolence and compassion, a bird's eye perspective on one's surroundings, and an impression of personal, actual, though nonphysical presence of sup portive agents (Moehle 1983). The occurrence of such experiences is be yond doubt, but many anthropologists and re ligious scholars have debated their relevance to religion, asking first whether such experience is sui generis, and second whether it has any thing to do with the persuasive power of re ligious cognition. On the first front, it is very difficult to argue that what is described as reli gious experience forms a natural kind, distinct from other kinds, of altered states of conscious ness (e.g., those experienced by nonreligious individuals) (Pyysi?inen 2004, Ratcliffe 2006). Although a number of recent studies have doc umented the specific neural correlates of med itation and trance (Azari et al. 2001, Persinger 1999) , these states do not require that individu als perceive any link to nonphysical agency. In deed, disciplines of meditation and trance can support diametrical interpretations, either in terms of powerful agency (Sufism) or agency as an illusion (Lamaism). Exceptional experience could be related to the evolution of religion if it had an impact on belief and commitment. Some archaeologists and anthropologists assume that experience based commitment was a general feature of archaic religion (Dornan 2004, Winkelman 2000) . This however remains hypothetical. Al though altered states of consciousness were not absent among early modern humans (Hayden 2003), we do not know how widespread these practices were. In all modern groups, such states are exceptional in one's lifetime and are typi cally the preserve of specialists (James 1902) or particular subgroups (Bourguigon 1973). More important, most religious rituals in most places do not require exceptional experience. "Sensory pageantry" in religious ritual often includes aes thetic displays, music, euphoria, and fear or www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion 117</page><page sequence="8">torture, but little if any disruptions of con sciousness (McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002). So the persuasive power of extraordinary experience may constitute only one of the many factors in the general diffusion of religious concepts and norms. One may also wonder about the possible evolutionary background to a general capac ity for religious belief. This question is diffi cult for several reasons. First, most people (in cluding anthropologists and religious scholars) think of belief in terms of conscious, deliber ate, evidence-based decisions and thereby ig nore a vast complexity of underlying cognitive processes (Stich 1983). Second, our best models of mental functioning are still altogether rudi mentary, as far as belief fixation is concerned (Gazzaniga 1998, Stich 1990). It is tempting to assume that acceptance of one's local reli gion stems from a general tendency to accept all culturally transmitted material (Dawkins 1998), but this is probably not sufficient to explain the recurrent features of religious thought, or indeed of cultural transmission in general (Sperber 1996). In religious scholarship, commitment to re ligious ideas is often construed in terms of the relative weighing of belief vs. unbelief, given a set of accessible arguments (Vergote 1985). However, this way of thinking about com mitment may be a residue of defensive, post Enlightenment religious institutions, in which "religion" is construed as an intellectual ter ritory to be defended against other forms of knowledge more than a property of belief in general. Indeed, it would seem that for most people in most human groups, norms and con cepts are made compelling by processes that largely escape conscious scrutiny, which may explain why the notion of "belief" is alien to most religious traditions (Needham 1972). Cognitive scientists have emphasized two features of everyday beliefs that may be rele vant here. First, to entertain a representation, e.g., of a particular situation, inferences are gen erated (possible causes, consequences, associ ations with similar situations) that would de termine if the representation was true, even in n8 Boy er Bergstrom cases where that representation is clearly per ceived as false (Gilbert 1991). Second, most re ligious statements are represented not as sim ple propositions but as complex formulae of the form "Proposition p is x" in which the "x" may stand for "true," "guaranteed by the ancestors," "said by the prophets," etc. Such statements are meta-represented (Cosmides &amp; Tooby 2000, Sperber 1997). They constitute "reflective be liefs," distinct from intuitive beliefs (e.g., that a table is a solid object) by the fact that reflec tive beliefs are explicidy represented along with comments on their validity (Sperber 1997). This view would suggest that two pro cesses are involved in generating commitment to religious statements. First, particular state ments are meta-represented so that the propo sitional content is specifically linked to partic ular authorities, which may strengthen their plausibility even when the content is not en tirely elucidated (Koenig et al. 2004). Second, people establish particular associations among these socially transmitted statements, particu lar events, and background cognitive principles (Boyer 1994)?a process we describe in the fol lowing section. THE COGNITIVE TURN Domain-Specific Dispositions A proper understanding of cultural phenom ena should start with an understanding of the cognitive processes whereby cultural repre sentations are acquired, stored, and transmit ted (Sperber 1996). In the past 15 years, this "cognitive turn" has resulted in what could be called a standard cognitive model of reli gious thought (Atran 2002; Barrett 2000, 2004; Boyer 1992, 2001; Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990; Pyysi?inen 2001). This is the consequence of remarkable progress in experimental psy chology, developmental psychology, and cog nitive neuroscience, which are converging to ward a description of mental functioning as the operation of many different functional sys tems, each of which is geared to representing a particular domain of reality (Hirschfeld &amp;</page><page sequence="9">Gelman 1994). For instance, children develop from infancy an understanding of physical and mechanical processes (Baillargeon 2004) and number (Feigenson et al. 2004, Xu et al. 2005), as well as early understandings of biological animacy (Rochat et al. 1997) and the mental states of other agents (Song et al. 2005). All these processes are based on specific epige netic principles that initialize domain-specific learning processes (Gelman 1994, Gelman &amp; Brenneman 1994). Young humans are disposed to extract enormous amounts of information from their social and natural environment pre cisely because they are equipped with sophis ticated prior principles that guide learning and development (Boyer &amp; Barrett 2005). Despite important developmental changes in knowl edge, these early principles also inform adult intuitive expectations about physical objects, in tentional agents, and biological processes. As a result of these largely tacit learning principles, some types of representations and associations are intrinsically easier to acquire, remember, and communicate than others. This would suggest a fractionated model of religion, in which different aspects of religious thought and behavior activate different mental capacities. Religious Ontologies: Agents and Objects The central feature of religious thought and behavior is a set of beliefs about nonphysical agents. In cognitive terms, such beliefs are a subset of a larger repertoire of supernatural concepts, found in religion but also in fantasy, dreams, superstitions, etc. Supernatural con cepts are highly constrained by domain-specific assumptions about persons, solid objects, and biological beings. For instance, a spirit is a spe cial kind of person, a magic wand a special kind of artifact, a talking tree a special kind of plant. Such notions are salient and inferentially productive because they combine specific fea tures that violate some default expectations for the domain with nonviolated expectations held by default as true of the entire domain (Boyer 1994). These combinations of explicit violation and tacit inference are culturally widespread and constitute a memory optimum (Barrett &amp; Nyhof 2001, Boyer &amp; Ramble 2001). This may be because explicit violations of expectations are attention-grabbing, whereas preserved nonvio lated expectations allow one to reason about the postulated agents or objects (Boyer 1994). A notion of god or spirit combines salient, explicidy transmitted violations of expectations (a god can move through physical objects, be at several places at once, etc.) and tacit, stan dard expectations of intuitive psychology (a god perceives what happens, remembers what he perceived, believes what he remembers, acts to bring about desired states of affairs, etc.). The human imagination tends to project human like and person-like features onto nonhuman or nonperson-like aspects of the environment; such representations are attention-grabbing or enjoyable; they are found in all religious tradi tions (Guthrie 1993). But anthropomorphism in religious concepts is also rather selective. That is, the domain of intuitions and inferences that is projected is intentional agency, more frequendy and consistendy projected than any other domain of human characteristics (Barrett &amp; Keil 1996). In this sense, concepts of religious agency can be described as derived from (and a possi ble by-product of) evolved dispositions to rep resent physical objects and intentional agents. But what is remarkable in religion is not just the production of supernatural concepts but also their social and emotional importance, which in a cognitive account also derives from evolved dispositions to morality and social interaction (Boyer 2000). Morality and Religion In many human groups, supernatural agency is associated with moral understandings. This may take the form of explicit moral codes supposedly laid down by gods or ancestors or stories of exemplary semimythical ethical paragons. More generally, people assume that supernatural agents keep a watch on them and www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion up</page><page sequence="10">are concerned about moral behavior (Boyer 2001). A cognitive-evolutionary account may explain why this latter assumption is "natural" enough to be found in nonliterate groups but also in the spontaneous religious thinking of most religious believers. Developmental evidence suggests that young children have an early understanding of moral imperatives. In particular, even preschoolers judge that moral norms, espe cially concerning justice or harm to others, are compelling whether or not they are expressed by an authority, apply to all places and contexts, and justify punishment when violated (Turiel 1983). These intuitions are remarkably stable across cultures (Song et al. 1987, Yau &amp; Smetana 2003). Moral understandings, far from being dependent on socially transmitted (e.g., religious) conceptual frames, develop be fore such concepts are intelligible to children, and regardless of which religious concepts are entertained by adults around the child (indeed, regardless of whether there are any religious concepts in the child's cultural environment). Interestingly, many early-developing and strongly emotional norms focus on social co ordination (e.g., norms about sharing, coop erating, not harming others) and coalitional signals (e.g., norms about etiquette, disgust at strangers' typical behaviors) (Nichols 2002, Stich 2006). This is why it makes sense to de scribe the development of moral feelings and intuitions in the context of evolved disposi tions for social interaction (Katz 2000, Krebs 1998). Moral understandings are an outcome of the commitment and solidarity mechanisms described above (see Commitment and Sig nals section). In this view, it is not surprising that moral intuitions exist prior to and out side of religious commitment, in much the same form across individuals, and with the same com pelling force (Krebs &amp; Van Hesteren 1994). Nor should it be surprising, then, that when people associate their moral understandings with nonphysical agency, the association tends to be a posthoc rationalization. Although re ligious believers generally hold that nonphys ical agency is the origin of morality, a cogni 120 Boyer Bergstrom tive model would suggest the reverse: that our moral feelings emerge independently but are consequently recruited to lend plausibility to the moral notions of religious agents. Religious morality is special only in that it adds an imagined agent (a god or ancestor) as a morally competent witness of one's own actions. In a series of experiments with children and adults, Bering has demonstrated that subjects readily consider nonphysical or dead agents as participants in their current situation. Children and adults are prepared to entertain the no tion that nonphysical agents are trying to com municate with them, and?importantly?these agents are generally (though implicitly) con strued as having full access to morally relevant aspects of a situation, such as people's motiva tions and the moral value of their actions. Su pernatural agents thereby come to be involved in representing how our actions would appear to others, particularly in terms of moral judg ment (Bering 2002, 2006; Boyer 2001). Ritualized Behavior Central to our intuitive definition of religion is the performance of rituals, more or less directly connected to beliefs about nonphysical agents. The notion of "ritual" is notoriously ambigu ous, a fact that some authors see as a manifesta tion of a highly flexible form of symbolism (Bell 1992). Others have argued that the vagueness lies in our categories and that all sorts of behav iors could be considered rituals by virtue of a very loose family resemblance so that the term is effectively useless (Lienard &amp; Boyer 2006). By contrast, there are some precise empiri cal criteria for what could more selectively be called "ritualized behavior" (Rappaport 1979). We can detect that specific sequences of ac tion, in a particular human group, are com pelling (one must perform them, given partic ular circumstances), rigidly scripted (one must perform them in the precise manner described), divorced from goals (specific actions are per formed without connection to usual empirical goals) and often internally redundant (the ac tions are reiterated, often a prescribed number</page><page sequence="11">of times) (Rappaport 1979). Also, recurrent fea tures of ritualized behavior include the use of special colors, a focus on numbers, the urge to delimit a specially protected space, an interest in cleansing and purity, and an insistence on order and symmetry (Dulaney &amp; Fiske 1994, Fiske &amp; Haslam 1997). These themes are found in socially acquired ceremonial behaviors, includ ing religion, but also in obsessive-compulsive pathologies (Freud 1906[1948]) and in normal child development (Evans et al. 1997). Classical anthropology and psychology of religion assumed that rituals made it possible to convey deep symbolic meanings (Bell 1992, Gluckman 1975, Turbott 1997). This view seems less than compelling to cognitive anthro pologists, given that many rituals include vague, incoherent, paradoxical, or just plain mean ingless elements (Humphrey &amp; Laidlaw 1993, Staal 1990). Indeed, ritualization reduces rather than increases the amount of information po tentially conveyed (Bloch 1974). So why should there be a disposition for such behaviors? Several authors have proposed that ritual ized behavior is, in fact, derivative. First, rit ual scripts activate an intuitive understanding of action that is also present in the representa tion of ordinary, nonritual behavior (Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990). Second, the particular themes of ritualized behavior may emerge from evolved cognitive and motivational systems geared to the representation of indirect threats to fitness (Lienard &amp; Boyer 2006). Humans can detect indirect cues of unobservable danger, such as the potential presence of predators and enemies (Barrett 2005), the risk of contagion (Siegal 1988), and threats to status and coalitional pro tection (Harcourt &amp; de Waal 1992). The rit ualized behaviors of patients and young chil dren seem to include many behavioral routines that are appropriate, species-specific prepara tions against such dangers. Culturally transmit ted ritual sequences may be attention-grabbing and compelling to the extent that they implicitly trigger associations with these protective rou tines (Lienard &amp; Boyer 2006). This notion would explain the cultural spread of these ritualized sequences in epidemi ological terms, as a consequence of their cogni tive effects on evolved dispositions. In this view, there is no special urge or capacity to perform rituals, religious or not. Rather, human minds are such that any sequence of action that is thematically related to precautionary concerns and explicitly associated with invisible dan ger will appear attention-grabbing and poten tially more compelling than action sequences that lack these characteristics (Lienard &amp; Boyer 2006). Over long-term cultural transmission, this would result in apparently compelling, highly prescribed sequences of nonpragmatic actions that people can readily associate with their concepts of nonphysical agency. Magic and Misfortune The themes of magical routines and recipes very often overlap with the precaution themes listed above. Many forms of magic constitute precautionary behaviors against real but un observable dangers (Sorensen 2002), yet a re current finding is that the actions prescribed seem to have little direct causal connection to the desired result; no intermediate mechanism is represented (Needham 1976). This may not be so surprising, given that magical prescrip tions typically effect changes on invisible ob jects, such as sources of contamination or other people's mental states. Indeed, this may be a general feature of precautionary thinking. In the domains of contagion, predation, or social relations, people are prepared to accept as plau sibly efficacious recipes whose causal mecha nisms are opaque (Fiddick 2004). Magical associations also frequently activate social cognitive capacities, particularly in the representation of misfortune. People assume that the ancestors or gods are involved in vari ous occurrences (bad crops, illness, death, etc.) but generally do not bother to represent in what way they bring about those states of affairs. That is, people's reasoning, when thinking about such situations, is entirely centered on the reasons why an ancestor would want them to fall ill or have many children and not on the causal pro cess by which they make it happen (Boyer 2000). www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion 121</page><page sequence="12">This is also true of the explanation for mishaps and disorders in terms of witchcraft. Witchcraft and evil eye notions may not really seem to be long in the domain of religion, but they show that there is a tendency to focus on the possi ble reasons for why some agents would cause misfortune, rather than the processes whereby they could do it. In a great majority of cases, the expression of these reasons is supported by our social exchange intuitions. People refused to follow God's orders, they polluted a house against the ancestors' prescriptions, they had more wealth or good fortune than their God decreed fate allocated them, and so on (Boyer 2000). All this supports what anthropologists have been saying for a long time on the ba sis of evidence gathered in the most various cultural environments: Misfortune is generally interpreted in social terms. But by itself, this familiar conclusion conceals the deeper indica tions that the evolved cognitive resources peo ple bring to their understanding of interaction are crucial to their construal of misfortune. Social Cognition The foregoing cognitive examples indicate that, in principle, people's concepts of gods or ances tors may recruit or exploit any of the diverse psychological systems that govern social rela tions, simply by virtue of the gods' representa tions as social agents. Various other programs of research have begun teasing out additional as pects of social cognition that appear to interact meaningfully with people's notions of supernat ural agents. For example, one line of inquiry has sug gested that people can form "attachment re lationships" with God or other noncorpo real agents (Granqvist 2006, Kirkpatrick 2005). These proposals draw from a rich literature on attachment dynamics in cognitive development and show that under some circumstances gods or spirits can simulate a real-world attachment figure: that is, offer a safe emotional haven in times of distress, enable a sense of security, and provide a secure base from which to explore life. Such a perspective illuminates certain as 122 Boyer Bergstrom pects of religion that are not easily explained by the dynamics of coalition or social exchange. For example, the need for physical proximity to icons, churches, or written texts; the impor tance of prayer in moments of extreme psycho logical distress; the importance of spiritual re lationships to those in a state of bereavement all receive some explanatory purchase from at tachment dynamics. Other aspects of religious cognition, such as teleological reasoning and afterlife beliefs, may also be rooted in basic operational characteris tics of social cognition (Bering 2006, Kelemen et al. 2005). Consistent with an interpretation of misfortune in social terms, an overarching bias to perceive events generally as manifestations of intentionality may contribute to a chronic sense of supernatural presence and intentional activity?a bias demonstrated even by children, e.g., with regard to the origin of natural objects (a view dubbed "intuitive theism") (Kelemen et al. 2005). Taking intentionality and social considerations a step further, another proposal considers that afterlife beliefs may originate from the interplay of theory of mind capacities, overperception of intentionality, and prosocial concerns regarding "moral" behavior vs. oppor tunistic behaviors (Bering 2006). Some of these new avenues of inquiry take the big religions as their empirical purview (e.g., Christianity), so it remains to be seen to what extent their explanatory reach will extend to other forms of religion. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS Most of humankind now lives in large-scale societies where religion is widely institution alized. People acquire their religious concepts and practices from large-scale institutions with specially trained, officially sanctioned religious officers, rather than from face-to-face interac tions with personally known ritual specialists. Also, many religious concepts and norms are acquired through literacy and electronic media rather than via oral transmission. To what ex tent do these changes affect the relevance of evolutionary approaches?</page><page sequence="13">Two Aspects of Religious Thought and Behavior Anthropologists have long emphasized the con trast between doctrinal systems, such as those of the "world religions," which are supported by large scale institutions, and "traditional" sys tems, such as village or tribe-based ancestor cults (Weber 1922), a distinction sometimes ex pressed as "great" vs. "small" traditions. These labels denote important differences in terms of types of institutions, kinds of practices, and the kinds of concepts and norms. First, the com petence of tribal religious specialists is typi cally sanctioned by their audience or clients rather than by an impersonal institution. Sec ond, the services that tribal specialists provide are highly variable and often attached to partic ular locations or groups. All this changes with the appearance of large-scale agrarian states, which produce religious institutions as we know them (Gelmer 1989). These changes may seem beyond the scope of evolutionary approaches because they have occurred only in recent his torical times. However, evolutionary consider ations are still relevant for two reasons. First, experimental studies show that in stitutional or organized religion has only a limited effect on people's religious cognitions, even in modern societies. Believers cultivate an explicit representation of their own be liefs that is largely in agreement with official doctrine, what Barrett has called "theological correctness" (Barrett &amp; Keil 1996). But im plicit tests show that their spontaneous, every day judgments are based not on doctrine but on intuitive expectations similar to the vari ous domain-specific principles described above (Barrett 2001, 2002), regardless of differences in religious traditions (Barrett 1998, Malley 2004, Slone 2004). Thus, religion as a cogni tive phenomenon is generally much closer to the tribal version than to the official one. These findings are crucial for a cognitively valid an thropology of religion. They show that the raw material of much anthropological description, people's explicit statements about their own be liefs, is a fragmentary and highly misleading source of information about people's religious thoughts. Second, the way religious institutions are built, work, and perpetuate themselves illus trates particular cognitive adaptations that pre date these historical developments. Institutions themselves are constrained by evolved cognitive capacities and therefore fall within the remit of an evolutionary perspective. Priestly Guilds and Doctrines Kingdoms and city-states gradually evolved out of the tribes and chiefdoms that were more typi cal of incipient agricultural societies (Maryanski &amp; Turner 1992). They provided economic niches for individuals and groups specialized in the provision of specific services, such as lin eages or castes of specialized craftsmen, ser vants, functionaries, and scribes. Groups of craftsmen or other specialists are generally or ganized in ways that optimize each member's potential share of a limited market. This is why we find that the development of large polities with tradesmen and craftsmen also heralds the development of guilds and other such profes sional groups (Greif 2006). Among these are groups of "priests" as distinct from local spe cialists. Priests are exclusive providers of par ticular religious services, whose competence is guaranteed by an impersonal institution. Institutionalization has a deep influence on religious concepts and on the use of particu lar cognitive capacities. Reformulating Weber's contrast between traditional and routinized forms of religion (Weber 1922), Whitehouse points out that most organized religion is cen tered on "doctrinal religiosity," with frequently repeated rituals and explicit religious state ments taught in the form of tightly argued propositional sermons (Whitehouse 2000). These rituals are usually not ethnically or lo cally based, they potentially recruit members far from their point of origin, they maintain a high degree of uniformity, and they generally involve specialized personnel with a centralized orga nization. They recruit semantic memory in the www.annualreviews.org Evolutionary Perspectives on Religion 123</page><page sequence="14">construction of elaborate doctrines, as opposed to the unexplained, salient, "imagistic" episodes of many tribal rituals (Whitehouse 2004). The differences in doctrine may be seen as a consequence of the specific markets and com modities involved. Religious specialists sup ply something (rituals, a guarantee that ritu als are efficacious, a specific link to supernat ural agents) that could be easily provided by competitors. Indeed, in most places with castes of religious priests, other providers exist: lo cal witch doctors, healers, shamans, holy men, and knowledgeable elders whose claims may be just as persuasive (Gellner 1994). An optimal path for priestly guilds is to gain political in fluence and use it against local, informal com petition, a universal phenomenon in religious history. Also, most priestly groups try to turn their services into a brand, that is, a type of ser vice that is (a) delivered by all providers from a same organization in the same form, (b) ex clusive to that organization, and (c) recognized as such (Giannias &amp; Giannias 2003). The ef fort toward greater coherence and stability in the religious concepts and practices, as well as the systematic use of literacy, which strengthens coherence and logical structure (Goody 1986), may be a response to this new market for reli gious services. The special conditions of modern industrial societies reinforce the dynamics of competition and branding (Ekelund et al. 2006), as soci ologists of religion have noted, mostly on the basis of modern U.S. religion (Greeley 1982). Such economic behavior is deeply influenced by evolved cognitive capacities, a point many economists have recently emphasized (McCabe &amp; Smith 2001, Smith 2008). EPILOGUE Evolutionary accounts of religious concepts and behaviors stand in contrast to other traditions in the study of religion. First, the varieties of evolutionary-cognitive framework outlined here are clearly reductionistic. Their aim is not to describe what it feels like to entertain reli gious thoughts, or in what way these thoughts 124 Boyer Bergstrom could make sense, but to explain their occur rence and their contents (Spilka et al. 1985). Second, this account suggests that religious processes are not sui generis. They do not re quire that we assume a specific religious or gan or religious mode of function in the mind (Boyer 1992). Third, even though there is a strong social demand for explaining religion in terms of a unique "origin," evolutionary and cognitive models suggest that this project makes little sense. Religion denotes a variety of behav iors and cognitive processes likely with different evolutionary backgrounds. Evolutionary considerations are relevant be yond early, archaic religion because they illu minate cognitive processes generally present in the transmission of culture, either in ancestral times or in modern societies. They may also help address some of the current issues that con front modern attitudes toward religion. The ap parent resurgence of religious extremism and its tragic consequences has prompted a flurry of commentary on how religion leads to self sacrifice and murder. Reflection on these issues may benefit from a better description of what is involved in religious affiliation and its fun damentalist varieties (Marty &amp; Appleby 1991, 1994). Biologically inspired models of commit ment and affiliation explain how people can be persuaded of the value of extremist action (Sageman 2004) and why the connection be tween religion and self-sacrifice is less direct than we generally presume (Pape 2005). Is religion an adaptation? An evolutionary perspective implies that manifest behaviors are enabled and supported by functional systems, which are the outcome of natural selection. Some of these functional systems can be con strued as adaptations, that is, reliably develop ing capacities or traits that provide evidence of complex functional design and confer poten tial reproductive advantages (or did so under ancestral conditions) (Symons 1992, Williams 1966). Also, the trait would have evolved grad ually from previous versions; adaptive advan tages would have been conferred by each incre mental change because evolution does not look ahead. These stringent criteria indicate that few</page><page sequence="15">of the features involved in serving some func tion can be described as evolutionary adapta tions. Many features of organisms can be parsi moniously explained in terms of preadaptations and by-products of adaptations, as well as the outcome of genetic drift and other nonevolu tionary processes (Buss et al. 1998). As far as religion is concerned, one can distinguish be tween models that tend to present religion (or some part thereof) as an adaptation (like the ca pacity to learn a natural language) (Irons 2001, Wilson 2002) and models couched in terms of by-products (like the capacity to read and write) (Barrett 2004; Boyer 1992, 2001). However, note that general statements about adaptations and by-products are conclusions, not starting points. Before we can say anything about the adaptive function of religious thoughts or be haviors, we must analyze what makes them pos sible, which is the substantial contribution of the models reviewed here. So far, traditional cultural anthropology, contrary to archaeology and other subfields, has made little use of the tools and findings of evolutionary biology (Durham 1991). In deed, the field has evinced a considerable hos tility to the introduction of evolution and ge netics in the study of culture (Brown 1991, Cronk 1999, Fox 1975, Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992). More generally, a widespread reluctance to entertain explanatory scientific reduction (D'Andrade 1995) has hindered an integra tion of cultural phenomena in the study of hu man nature (Wilson 1998). Resolution of such paradigmatic disputes lies less in philosophical debates than in comparing the relative explana tory power of different approaches. That is why proponents of an integrated, evolutionary cognitive approach to cultural phenomena will need to provide more empirical evidence, par ticularly more cross-cultural studies, to over come the discipline's preference for "segrega tion" models, which depict human cultures as lying outside the influence of evolution and genetics. Religion may be a particularly apposite test case for the evolutionary cognitive approach. The domain is a priori unconstrained?people might let their imaginations run freely when it comes to representing nonphysical agency. But we do find an impressive set of recurrent fea tures, for which classical anthropological the ory has no coherent, predictive, independently based explanatory hypotheses. By contrast, the models reviewed above show that evolutionary perspectives can help us make sense of specif ically human, and otherwise puzzling, cultural phenomena. Religion is only one among var ious domains in which very different socially transmitted input results in highly similar, re current cultural traits. Notions of nonphys ical agency, their powers, and their connec tions to human beings are so widespread that explanations couched purely in terms of lo cal knowledge are clearly missing the point. What is needed is a more detailed investigation into an evolved psychology shaped by natural selection.
