<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kuru, AIDS, and Witchcraft Reconfiguring Culpability in Melanesia and Africa Isak Niehaus Abstract: This article examines the significance of witchcraft accusa- tions during the South African AIDS epidemic. In search of broader intercontextual understanding, I compare experiences of AIDS in Bush- buckridge, where I have done fieldwork, with anthropological studies of kuru, a transmissible degenerative disease, in Papua New Guinea. Whereas scientists blamed the spread of kuru on the practice of canni- balism, those who were affected attributed it to sorcery. These dynam- ics resonate with the encounters between health workers and host populations during the AIDS epidemic in Bushbuckridge. Health propa- ganda attributed the rapid transmission of HIV to sexual promiscuity. In response, sufferers and their kin invoked witchcraft, shifting blame onto outsiders and reinforcing the relations that medical labeling threatened to disrupt. The comparison enables us to see witchcraft accusations as a means of reconfiguring culpability, cutting certain networks, and strengthening other existing configurations.

Rosenberg (1992) observes that epidemics follow a common dramatic pattern of increased revelatory tension, a move toward crisis, and a drift toward closure. Epidemics, he argues, are social 'sampling devices', disrupting once stable modes of social reproduction and stripping life bare, revealing ideas, structural inequalities, and conflicts that are kept subdued in less critical times.

Through- out the history of epidemics, diverse actors have stigmatized disease carriers and other 'scapegoats'. Foreigners were singled out for blame during epidemics in Renaissance Italy, untouchables in India, and Jews in Europe (Herring and Swedlund 2010). Likewise, the AIDS epidemic has spawned various 'geogra- phies of blame' (Farmer 1992). In the global North, epidemiologists designate 'disreputable' populations- such as intravenous drug users, gay men, and immigrants- as 'risk groups'. This contributes to various forms of discrimina- tion. Competing discourses flourished in the global South. Popular conspiracy theories posited that the American military deliberately created AIDS as a means of biological warfare or as a strategy of discouraging black people from procreating. There were also claims that European sex tourists introduced HIV. Within village communities, elders blame the youth, and men blame 'free women' for the AIDS epidemic (Farmer 1992; Schoepf 2001; Weiss 1993). In this article, I investigate the spate of witchcraft accusations that AIDS has unleashed in Southern Africa. Sufferers, their kin, diviners, and Christian healers often interpret as evidence of witchcraft the very same symptoms that are diagnosed by physicians as AIDS. Ashforth (2002) shows how residents of Soweto see common symptoms of AIDS as those of slow poisoning, called isidliso. They allege that witches insert a small creature into the gullet of their victims, which gradually devours them from the inside. Isidliso covers literally anything that affects the lungs, stomach, and digestive tract and leads to a slow, wasting illness. Ashforth finds the association of AIDS with witchcraft to be par- ticularly plausible in contexts of inequality and insecurity. Other parts of South- ern Africa have witnessed a resurgence of witch-finding and witch-cleansing movements (Andersson 2002; Probst 1999; Schoepf 2001; Yamba 1997). A similar situation can be found in Impalahoek, a village in the Bushbuck- ridge municipality of South Africa's Mpumalanga Province,1 where I have conducted intermittent fieldwork. Starting in 1990, I visited Impalahoek for a period of at least one month each year, doing participant observation and con- ducting open-ended interviews on topics such as witchcraft beliefs and accusa- tions, politics, sexuality, and the AIDS epidemic. Villagers did not believe that witches actually sent AIDS, but they were of the opinion that witches manu- factured sicknesses that mimicked its symptoms. In this manner, witches took advantage of the epidemic and used AIDS as a shield to disguise their nefarious activities (Niehaus 2013: 155-157). Researchers often see the framing of AIDS in terms of witchcraft as a matter of indigenous belief obstructing effective health seeking (Pronyk 2001). To gain deeper, intercontextual insight into the significance of witchcraft accusations during the AIDS epidemic in Bushbuckridge, I have utilized theo- retical insights from Melanesian anthropology, notably studies of the kuru epidemic in Papua New Guinea. Certain similarities between AIDS and kuru enable a comparative analysis. Like AIDS, kuru is an incurable disease - a slow infection that can remain dormant in the human body for years before its first symptoms appear. As with AIDS, the host population also invoked mystical explanations, blaming sorcerers for the kuru epidemic.2</page><page sequence="3">Kuru, AIDS, and Witchcraft | 27 I am particularly drawn to the work of Warwick Anderson (2000, 2008), who analyzes the labeling of kuru in terms of multiple networks of relatedness, interaction, and exchange. His use of 'network' is considerably broader than that of Thornton (2009: 413-414), who has fruitfully investigated the nature of 'sexual networks' as "intricate social structures constituted primarily by sexual relationships" in South Africa and in Uganda. Anderson treats networks as comprising a broad range of human and non-human actors that are involved not only in the transmission of disease (pathogens, bodies, corpses), but also in the articulation of illness (sick people, their caretakers and kin, diviners and healers whom they consult, medical technologies, physicians and scientists). He shows how the labeling of kuru by diverse actors was an intensely political act, involving the allocation of blame and culpability. It constituted persons and networks in particular ways, bringing certain modes of relationality into view and, at the same time, occluding others. The allocation of blame involved the construction of boundaries, the 'cutting of networks' (Strathern 1996), and also the strengthening of existing configurations. Anderson (2000, 2008) documents how the biomedical and scientific frater- nity first interacted closely with the South Fore in labeling kuru and searching for a responsible agent, but then, in its readiness to connect kuru to the canni- balistic consumption of dead humans, set the South Fore apart on the basis of a disreputable alterity. By attributing kuru to the sorcery of affines and neighbors, the South Fore countered victim blaming and reconfigured culpability. Through his analysis of this complex series of transactions, Anderson enables us to transcend the conventional view that sorcery is simply a matter of attachment to local belief. His research is particularly pertinent to Bushbuckridge, where health workers and educators played a central role in labeling AIDS as an incur- able condition that resulted from sexual promiscuity. Such framing stigmatized villagers and contributed to the exclusion of people living with AIDS from networks of social intercourse. In a bid to shift culpability onto different sets of networks, and in order to reinforce the relations that AIDS threatened to disrupt, accusations of witchcraft followed in the wake of this victim blaming. Kuru in the New Guinea Highlands As Anderson (2000, 2008) shows, the labeling of kuru arose from a complex series of interactions within a broad network, comprising Australian patrol offi- cers, medical scientists, anthropologists, and the South Fore. These interactions involved the global circulation of scientific valuables, including biomedical technologies, pathogens, and corpses. Operating from a post at Okapa, Australian patrol officers made contact with the South Fore in the eastern highlands of New Guinea during the late 1940s. A group of about 14,000 slash-and-burn horticulturalists, the South Fore culti- vated sweet potato, taro, yam, corn, sugar cane, and bananas. They kept pigs and hunted small mammals, cassowaries, other birds, and reptiles. South Fore men accompanied the patrol officers to witness the operations of government</page><page sequence="4">28 I Isak Niehaus in Port Moresby, learning how to build roads and to cultivate new crops such as potato, tomato, and coffee (Anderson 2000: 718). In 1953, a patrol officer noticed a South Fore girl sitting by a fire. She shiv- ered violently, her head jerking from side to side. Unable to eat, she died within a few weeks. This was the first recorded case of kuru (lit., 'trembling' or 'fear') in medical literature. With the discovery of new cases, medical orderlies dis- covered that the symptoms of kuru were remarkably uniform. As a 'slow infec- tion', it could remain invisible for incubation periods of up to several decades. The disease began with a failure of muscle coordination and a tremor involving the extremities and the head. After a few months, speech became unintelli- gible, and the afflicted person could no longer walk or stand. The victim then became progressively incapacitated, being unable to eat, urinate, or defecate. Death was inevitable and followed the first clinical signs by about three to five months (Lindenbaum 1979: 10). Medical scientists in Port Moresby initially described kuru as 'acute hysteria' in otherwise healthy adults. The anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt elaborated upon this perception. They observed that the Fore attributed kuru to sorcery and hypothesized that the disease was a manifestation of stress and emotional insecurity, occasioned by European contact. Following Can- non's (1942) well-known essay on 'voodoo death', the Berndts reasoned that fears provoked by the threat of sorcery could have far-reaching psychosomatic effects (see Berndt 1954). This suggestion influenced colonial practice. A patrol officer called together the villagers, made a great bonfire, and asked them to burn all of the items that they might use in sorcery. Sorcery accusations declined, but kuru deaths did not abate (Anderson 2008: 14). A careful review of ethnographic evidence suggests that while the South Fore did attribute kuru to sorcery, they also explored alternative mystical expla- nations for the onset of the disease. They believed that sorcerers harmed their intended victims by burying items of their clothing, along with sorcery bundles, in swampy land. Diviners cooked food in a number of bamboo containers, each representing a particular village. Food that did not cook properly showed which village housed the responsible sorcerers. Should diviners be able to retrieve the buried clothing, they believed, the victim would recover (Beasley 2006: 187). But the South Fore also identified kuru as 'cassowary disease' (i.e., foolishness resulting from assaults by anthropomorphic spirits) and as a manifestation of 'ghost winds'. They fed the sufferers bark from casuarinas trees, whose sway- ing resembled tremors of the body. The South Fore saw ghost winds as a sign that the arrival of cargo was imminent. On these occasions, they placed human skulls in villages and filled newly built home with stones, wood, and leaves. After anointing the items with pig blood, they awaited their transformation into paper, knives, and rifles (Berndt 1954: 226). Henceforth, scientific discourses increasingly medicalized kuru and also the South Fore themselves. After spending 20 days among the South Fore in 1956, Vin Zigas, a medical officer, began to suspect that kuru might well be an exam- ple of encephalitis. Zigas collaborated with Carleton Gajdusek, an American specialist in biophysical chemistry and child development working at the Hall</page><page sequence="5">Kuru, AIDS , and Witchcraft | 29 Institute in Melbourne who was often described as an erratic and irritating col- league, but one who worked with great enthusiasm. In 1957, Gajdusek began to study kuru from a base camp at Okapa, and he, too, became convinced that kuru would turn out to have a biological cause. But he viewed the disease in the broadest possible perspective, considering the interactions of biochemistry, culture and society, and the lived realities of people's lives. He actively sought the collaboration of other biomedical scientists, anthropologists, and the South Fore, participating in exchanges, building networks, and negotiating relations. Gajdusek first compiled a census of the entire Fore region, mapping out the distribution of kuru. He determined that the epidemic was concentrated among the South Fore, noting fatalities of up to 10 percent in some hamlets. He also reported that kuru entered the South Fore area during the late 1920s and reached a peak between 1957 and 1960, when it claimed about 200 deaths per annum. Although the vast majority of adult victims were women, kuru affected boys and girls with about equal frequency. At the height of the epidemic, life expectancy for a South Fore woman was little more than 20 years, leaving men without wives and infants without mothers. However, in subsequent years, the age at which the first clinical signs appeared increased. In search of the infectious agent, Gajdusek urged the South Fore to donate samples of their blood, spinal fluid, and urine for chemical analysis and the corpses of their loved ones for medical autopsies. He dissected the bodies on his dining room table, preparing them for scientific examination, and then air- freighted them to metropolitan laboratories for microbiological analysis (Ander- son 2000: 725). Gajdusek plied kuru sufferers with virtually every drug that biomedicine had to offer, including vitamins, anti-convulsants, tranquilizers, anabolic steroids, and corticosteroids. He treated mundane infections, tended to wounds, and distributed soap, blankets, and clothing. Microbiological analysis showed pathological changes to the central nervous system and neurological deterioration of brain tissue. But it failed to identify the toxic element. Bennett et al. (1958) theorized that kuru might be a hereditary disorder, deter- mined by a single autosomal gene, dominant in females but recessive in males. Scientists cautiously accepted this suggestion as the best available hypothesis. To prevent the spread of the genetic trait, some even urged the government to create a kuru reserve from which no emigration would be allowed. However, this eugenics policy was not practically enforceable (Anderson 2008: 128). In 1959, the veterinary pathologist William Hadlow provided Gajdusek with a new model for the transmission of kuru. Hadlow observed that the brain tis- sue of kuru victims resembled sheep brains with scrapie, a degenerative infec- tious disease. There were characteristic vacuoles between the cells, giving the tissue a spongy appearance. Veterinary scientists had successfully transferred the disease to healthy sheep and goats, suggesting that a 'slow virus' was responsible. In 1963, Gajdusek and his co-workers inoculated chimpanzees intracerebrally with diseased material from deceased kuru victims. Two years later, the primates began to develop neurological disorders akin to kuru. If a rare slow virus was indeed responsible for kuru, how then was it trans- mitted among the South Fore? To answer this question, attention shifted from</page><page sequence="6">30 I Isak Niehaus laboratories back to the field. During 1961 and 1962, the anthropologists Robert Glasse and Shirley Lindenbaum studied the social aspects of kuru. By gathering information on kinship, they were able to reject a purely hereditary interpreta- tion of transmission. They noted that many kuru victims were kin in a social, non-biological sense. The recentness of kuru also made a hereditary explana- tion hard to defend. Glasse and Lindenbaum began to suspect that the uniden- tified agent for kuru might be transmitted by endo-cannibalism: "When a body was considered for human consumption, none of it was discarded except the bitter gall bladder ... [M]aternal kin dismembered the corpse with a bamboo knife and stone axe. They first removed the hands and feet, then cut open the arms and legs to strip the muscles . . . After severing the head, they fractured the skull to remove the brain. Meat, viscera and brain were all eaten. Marrow was sucked from cracked bones, and sometimes the pulverized bones them- selves were cooked and eaten with green vegetables" (Lindenbaum 1979: 20). The consumption of the flesh of deceased relatives explained the concentra- tion of kuru among certain families and also its sex and age distribution. Glasse and Lindenbaum wrote that men claimed prior rights to pork to compensate for the depletion of wild game. Women supplemented their lesser allotment of pork with small game, insects, and dead humans, and young children ate whatever their mothers gave them. A woman's brain (the most significant body matter in the transmission of the disease) was given to the wives of her broth- ers and sons. According to Glasse and Lindenbaum, children who grew up after the suppression of cannibalism by missionaries did not succumb to the disease. The epidemic slowly abated, and by the 1990s there were hardly any deaths (Lindenbaum 2001: 368). Anderson (2008) and Beasley (2009) describe the growing anger and bitter- ness expressed by the South Fore toward health workers and scientists, whom they saw as taking without giving. Grief stricken by the loss of kin, South Fore men desperately desired a cure. They had already been exposed to the suc- cesses of medical treatment in the case of yaws, and initially saw it as their responsibility to accompany the Australian medical orderlies on their danger- ous missions. The men assisted in providing basic treatment for dying relatives, translated conversations for the orderlies, helped collect biological specimens, and witnessed medical examinations and autopsies. But the South Fore gradu- ally lost confidence in medical explanations for kuru. Existing histories do not make this clear, but the change in attitude of the South Fore seems to have been a response to the manner in which scientists and health workers pathologized local culture by blaming the kuru epidemic on sorcery beliefs and cannibalism. Although outsiders almost universally accepted the thesis of the cannibalistic transmission of kuru, critics found little evidence to support it. They contended that the Fore might plausibly have spread kuru through the handling of decomposing corpses in pre-Christian mortuary rituals (Arens 1979; Steadman and Merbs 1982). 3 The South Fore themselves were not convinced by the suggestion that cannibalism might be responsible for kuru. When anthropologists raised this hypothesis, they responded with 'uncer- tainty'. This was true even in 2008, after missionaries had proselytized for half a</page><page sequence="7">Kuru , AIDS, and Witchcraft | 31 century and current generations had rejected the behavior of their ancestors as incompatible with Christianity (Lindenbaum 2010: 324). Scientists gradually departed from Papua New Guinea. In 1976, Gajdusek won a Nobel Prize for discovering a new disease etiology.4 But thereafter sci- entific interventions became more detached and less beneficial to the South Fore. During the 1990s, Stanley Prusiner determined that a pathogenic protein, called 'prion', rather than any virus, was the cause of kuru. Prions are "small proteinaceous infectious particles" that "resist inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids" (Lindenbaum 2001: 366). This discovery earned Prusiner, too, a Nobel Prize. However, unlike Gajdusek's research, Prusiner's work was confined to high-tech laboratories, and his interactions were largely with California's lucrative biochemical industry (Anderson 2008: 192-198). None of the research ever led to a cure. Yet kuru became crucial for understand- ing other pathologies, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Alzheimer's, and HIV/AIDS. Since kuru withstood all biomedical cures, the South Fore no longer accepted that it might be a 'sickness' ( sik malaria). By the 1990s, they refused to be hospitalized and turned down five out of every six medical requests for autopsies. Many bodies were not available for any price. One man refused to allow a scientist to draw his wife's blood, saying, "You are just wasting your time. Kuru is due to sorcery" (Anderson 2008: 178). Sorcery now became the hegemonic explanation for kuru. It accounted for the resilience of kuru against biomedical interventions and, at the same time, countered victim blaming. Accusations of sorcery also rendered certain local modes of relationality more visible. Among the South Fore, networks of kin and affines stretched across different village settlements, which created a situation of competing loyalties. In this context, accusations of sorcery helped define group boundaries. They led to the complete severing of alliances between the Wanitabe and Nabu, two parish segments that had previously collaborated in activities such as arranging marriage payments (Lindenbaum 1979: 118-119). The accusations also cut the intimacy between different affinal groups resident within common neighborhoods, leading them to keep each other at a distance. The accused sorcerers were nearly always widowers who had in the past aspired to be great men (ibid.: 121-125). The South Fore never located enemies within their own patrilineages. They policed the boundaries of their hamlets more firmly than they had done before, closing all gates and posting sentries at night (ibid.: 28). Hope lay in locating and destroying sorcery bundles. AIDS in Bushbuckridge, South Africa Anderson's (2000, 2008) emphasis on broad networks of interaction and exchange involved in the labeling and articulation of kuru offers insights that can help us transcend the view that the attribution of AIDS to witchcraft is purely a matter of attachment to indigenous cosmology. As in the case of sor- cery during the kuru epidemic, the invocation of witchcraft was a means to</page><page sequence="8">32 I Isak Niehaus counter victim blaming in health propaganda about AIDS and a bid to recon- figure culpability by shifting blame onto different sets of networks. In 1982, a white, gay male air steward was the first South African to be diag- nosed HIV positive. He had possibly contracted the virus in New York. By 1987, several black South African mine workers tested positive for HIV antibodies, and by 1990 it was clear that the epidemic was mainly heterosexually transmitted. Infection was rapid, given diffusion across South Africa's long, permeable north- ern border and the very high prevalence of labor migration. By 2003, 5.3 mil- lion citizens were infected with HIV, and the South African AIDS epidemic had become the fastest growing epidemic in the world (Iliffe 2006: 45). The disease reached Bushbuckridge fairly late but then spread rapidly. Between 1995 and 2005, AIDS became the predominant cause of death in all age groups. Antenatal seroprevalence at the local Tintswalo Hospital increased from 2 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 2007 (MacPherson et al. 2009). Unlike in the case of kuru, the medical establishment did not primarily use rural areas as laboratories to learn about the virology of AIDS and other factors that might facilitate its transmission. During the 1960s, the science of kuru, slow viruses, and prions was at a 'revolutionary stage', when previously estab- lished paradigms were being challenged, contested, and overturned. During the 1990s, the science of HIV/AIDS was at a 'normal stage', when established biomedical paradigms were being defended with a great deal of confidence (Kuhn 1962). In a global epidemic there was very little to be learned from local settings: the facts were known and had to be proselytized. Thus, public health educators played a crucial role in labeling and allocat- ing blame for AIDS in Bushbuckridge. The relations between them and vil- lagers comprised asymmetrical pedagogical interactions, marked by unequal exchanges. Residents of Bushbuckridge learned about HIV/AIDS from health propaganda well before they could identify people suffering from its symptoms. The scale and urgency with which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the public health fraternity undertook AIDS-awareness education vastly exceeded efforts connected to any previous public health campaigns, such as those targeting malaria, tuberculosis, and family planning. In 1992, the Health Systems Development Unit and Reproductive Health Groups Project launched sexual health programs. Staff members gave regular talks on sexual hygiene to police, clergy, headmen, diviners, and youth at local schools. The organizations also trained teachers as sex educators. In 2000, a LoveLife youth center was built only 6 kilometers from Impalahoek. The NGO aimed to promote a positive lifestyle based on romantic love, being faithful, abstaining from sex, and using condoms. It hosted motivational workshops, dancing, studio broadcasting, computer training, drama, basketball, and volleyball (Wahlström 2000). AIDS awareness became an important component of life-orientation classes in local schools. Each quarter, teachers at Impalahoek Primary divided the stu- dents into three groups. Teachers did not mention sex to the youngest learners, but they warned the children not to play with scissors, razors, and pins; not to touch bleeding friends; and not to inflate balloons (i.e., condoms) that they found lying around. The teachers demonstrated safe sex to the older learners</page><page sequence="9">Kuru, AIDS, and Witchcraft | 33 using stage props such as artificial penises and different kinds of condoms. AIDS activists addressed students at secondary schools as often as twice a week. Young people told me that they felt overburdened by constantly having to listen to these messages about AIDS. As in the case of kuru, interventions by the medical community were for a long time non-therapeutic. By focusing on prevention rather than care, these campaigns created the impression that AIDS was a fatal, incurable, and unbeat- able disease. 'Groundbreakers' at the LoveLife youth center used scare tactics. During one workshop they showed attendees vidéocassettes of Ethiopians dying of AIDS-related diseases. The only message they gave about treatment was that those who ate fruit and vegetables might prolong their lives. During the tenure of President Thabo Mbeki, the South African government stalled the provision of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs).5 A network of 3 hospitals, 7 health centers, and 57 clinics in Bushbuckridge merely screened pregnant women for seroprevalence, provided voluntary counseling and testing, and treated opportunistic infections. In 1999, the Rixile ('rising sun' in XiTsonga) HIV Clinic was established at Tintswalo Hospital, within walking distance of Impalahoek. The clinic monitored CD4 counts, hosted support groups, and assisted people in applying for disability grants. Yet only in 2005 did Rixile begin to supply highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) to patients who registered a CD4 count of below 200. HAART proved very effective in suppressing viral replication and drastically reduced morbidity and mortality (MacPherson et al. 2009: 5). 6 By December 2008, 6,638 patients had enrolled at Rixile. Yet the clinic's services reached only 20 percent of those in need within its catchment area, and the peda- gogical emphasis remained. All patients were required to attend treatment literacy classes, where facilitators lectured them on how to live productive lives with ARVs while lambasting the masculine pursuits of drinking, smoking, and engaging in sex with multiple partners (Mfecane 2010: 109-110). Ethnographic evidence shows that, by blaming the spread of HIV on pro- miscuous and unsafe sexual intercourse, the messages of health educators stig- matized both the host populations and the sick people themselves. By labeling AIDS as fatal, early public health campaigns also contributed to the perception that HIV-positive persons were tainted with death. But there was another, per- haps more important way in which stigma was created. Because HIV has such a long incubation period, identifying someone as HIV positive frequently amounts to an accusation that he or she had (in all likelihood) spread the disease to past and present sexual partners and was therefore responsible for their pending deaths. Much like the claims about South Fore cannibalism, these assertions set villagers of Bushbuckridge apart on the basis of a disreputable alterity. These messages profoundly shaped local perceptions of AIDS. Residents of Impalahoek identified HIV-positive persons as 'dead before dying' and symboli- cally located them in the liminal domain between life and death. Their bodies, like those of biblical lepers, were seen as comprising an anomalous mixture of living and dead flesh. This conception raised the uncomfortable possibility of pollution that they might represent to outsiders (Niehaus 2007) . Such labeling</page><page sequence="10">34 I Isak Niehaus contributed to the rejection of HIV-positive people from networks comprising sexual partners, kin, and neighbors. Among the first recognized victims of AIDS in Impalahoek were two young women who had sought their fortunes in Johannesburg but returned to their natal homesteads in a severe state of ill health. At their funerals, mourners gossiped that they had worked as prosti- tutes on the city's streets. Villagers perceived HIV-infected persons as extremely polluting and gener- ally secluded them indoors, keeping them from public view. This was done as much to protect vulnerable sick people from others as to protect others from them. Adults sometimes delegated the tasks of care to younger men, such as cousins and nephews. There were also cases of severe neglect. An extreme example is the case of George Bila, a construction worker. In 1988, George developed severe diarrhea and became extremely thin. After a few months, lesions appeared on his legs, and he soon was unable to walk. His parents confined him to a small, one-roomed building in their backyard, where he lay on the floor on a mattress. George's family had given up all hope that he might recover. His brothers brought him food and water, and his sister occasion- ally washed him, but George's room was often filthy. He was delirious, and neighbors frequently heard him call out at night, screaming for water. George's funeral was a bitter occasion, attended by very few mourners. At times, testing HIV positive has been a source of bitter conflict between husbands and wives and, on at least one occasion, has even been a pretext for homicide. In December 2004, the chair of a local community police forum (CPF) told me of a most horrible killing. Ferris Dube returned from his workplace in Johannesburg after a long period of absence. He suffered from a persistent cough and consulted a general practitioner. Ferris's wife accompanied him, and on the way back home she screamed at him, saying that he had merely returned to Bushbuckridge to infect her with the 'dreaded disease'. The next day, neigh- bors reported that they had heard the couple arguing throughout the night and saw smoke coming from the windows of their home in the morning. Members of the CPF broke down the door, but they were too late. They discovered that Ferris had tied his wife to their bed with an electric cord, doused her with pet- rol, and burned her to death. He then committed suicide by setting himself on fire. Although Ferris had left a suicide note, nobody could decipher its meaning. Silence was a common strategy to avoid antagonisms and conflicts that might cut intimate social relations and tear households apart. For example, orators at funerals in Impalahoek hardly ever mentioned AIDS as the cause of death (Durham and Klaits 2002; McNeill and Niehaus 2010; Stadler 2003). Vil- lagers spoke of AIDS only in backstage domains and even then avoided using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' directly. Instead, they would employ euphemisms, saying that people suffered from the 'three letters' ( maina a mararo) or from the 'fashionable disease' {Iwetši bjagona bjalo ). During the first 15 years of the epidemic, few people chose to be tested for HIV antibodies, saying that knowledge of a positive result would cause unbear- able stress, hastening rather than delaying their deaths. Those who chose medical testing and treatment tended to view it as a last resort. Pronyk (2001)</page><page sequence="11">Kuru, AIDS , and Witchcraft | 35 calculates a mean delay of 10 weeks from the onset of tuberculosis (the most prominent AIDS-related disease) and the commencement of treatment among 298 patients at Tintswalo Hospital. In some cases, the delay exceeded a year. The use of medical facilities increased greatly after HAART became available, yet patients were still reticent about therapeutic consultations and often visited the clinic under the cover of darkness. They complained of unbelievably long waiting lines, saying that they would arrive at 6:45 am and would not be seen by a doctor until 3:00 pm. Patients also described conditions in hospitals, such as those prevailing in the tuberculosis wards, as extremely spartan. They told me that they were fed only in the morning and at tea time and that their mat- tresses sometimes smelled of urine. Occasionally, silence and concealment gave way to more direct forms of resistance, such as when residents of Impalahoek contested and challenged the messages contained in health propaganda. As elsewhere in South Africa, men saw multiple sexual partners as a sign of success, rather than a source of shame (Delius and Glaser 2005; Hunter 2005). However, they were extremely sensitive to the manner in which outsiders attached negative connotations to 'African sexuality'. Indeed, President Mbeki's denial of the sexual mode of transmission of HIV was, in part, a reaction to racist renditions of Africans as "promiscuous carriers of germs" who display "uncontrollable devotion to the lust of sin" (Posel 2005: 127). My research interviewees condemned the eager- ness of AIDS activists to scrutinize the sexuality of others and disapproved of their lack of discretion in discussing sex with youngsters. Given the profound stigma, they found it inconceivable that the activists would encourage people to reveal their HIV status in public. Much like the questionable thesis of cannibalistic transmission of kuru, the notion that sexual promiscuity is responsible for the rapid spread of HIV stands on shaky grounds. Recent evidence suggests that the key difference between Southern Africa and regions with lower rates of infection is not sexual behavior per se, but rather the concurrency of relations with different sexual partners (Epstein 2007) and the diffuse nature of sexual networks. Thornton (2009: 413) convincingly links vulnerability to HIV infection to individuals maximizing "their social capital by extending the diversity and density of their sexual networks." Popular conspiracy theories deflected the culpability from local sexual net- works and relocated it onto powerful external actors, such as the government, the business community, and even the medical fraternity itself. There were widespread rumors in Impalahoek that Wouter Basson, the cardiologist who had been the head of the old apartheid government's chemical weapons pro- gram, had actually manufactured AIDS as a means of reducing South Africa's black population. Two men told me that South Africa's new government pur- posefully withheld a cure for AIDS because it benefited financially from taxes and bribes paid by the funeral industry and by those involved in the clandes- tine transnational trade in organs harvested from deceased people (Niehaus and Jonsson 2005). There were also widespread rumors that government- issued condoms had actually been laced with 'HIV worms' (McNeill 2009).</page><page sequence="12">36 I Isak Niehaus It was easier to identify the source of witchcraft accusations than of con- spiracy theories. In Impalahoek, particular cases of sickness and death usually provoked fierce disagreement. Whereas outsiders were more inclined to men- tion AIDS, especially when gossiping in backstage domains, insiders such as kin were more likely to identify witchcraft as the cause. During fieldwork, I recorded details of 126 deaths that villagers attributed to AIDS. In 27 of these, insiders declared that witches were actually responsible. These claims, like the conspiracy theories, were a reaction to the victim blaming inherent in medical discourses about AIDS. They reconfigured culpability, absolved sufferers from being responsible for their own sickness and from potentially having infected sexual partners, and shifted blame onto outsiders. In this way, witchcraft accu- sations were bids to affect relational forms (Myhre 2009): they drew boundar- ies that cut certain networks and, at the same time, strengthened others that the stigma of AIDS threatened to disrupt. Here, different patterns are apparent. In 13 cases, household members accused non-kin, such as neighbors, colleagues, Christian preachers, diviners, or unnamed outsiders. These accusations were bids to reinforce the boundary between kin and non-kin and also to bolster the solidarity of domestic units. This is apparent in the case of Elphas Shokane, who developed skin lesions, experienced severe abdominal pains, and lost his appetite soon after he started work as a gardener at an electricity supply depot. A diviner told Elphas and his parents that a neighbor had bewitched him in the hope that he would resign so that her son could be appointed to his position. Elphas remarked: "I think it was an old woman. She saw me carrying groceries home to my parents and asked me for a cold drink." In this instance, the accusation of witchcraft drew atten- tion to Elphas's contribution to his parents' household before he became sick. In another four cases, household members blamed spouses of the sick per- sons. These accusations were bids to cut relations constituted through bride wealth and thereby strengthen the ties between cognates. They were also an attempt to reverse the arrow of culpability. This is apparent in the example of Moses Chiloane. Starting in 1992, when Moses lost his position as a truck driver, his wife, Lerato, had supported him from the salary she earned as a teacher. She bought him a van and gave him sufficient money to purchase beer every day. According to rumors, Moses contracted HIV when he cheated on Lerato with younger women. However, when Moses first became severely ill in 2002, his sister alleged that Lerato had doctored him with 'love potions' ( korobela ). She even threw stones at Lerato's car, breaking the rear window. These allegations resurfaced after Moses died. His cognates now claimed that when Lerato's aunt came to pray for Moses, she actually placed herbs underneath his mattress to hasten his death. Outside observers told me that, in making these accusations, Moses's cognates were staking a claim to inherit his estate. Eleven accusations were made against senior members of the same domes- tic unit, most often fathers. These accusations expressed intergenerational tensions that had become pronounced since the 1990s. In South Africa, ide- ologies of national liberation that accompanied the end of apartheid posited a progressive process of increased status and prosperity through time. In these</page><page sequence="13">Kuru, AIDS, and Witchcraft | 37 ideologies, children were expected to be improved versions of their parents (Fer- guson 2006: 176-193). But the actual experiences of young men who entered the labor market during an era of deindustrialization and high unemployment contradicted the visions of the future that these discourses provided. Sons were often quick to learn that their fathers actually enjoyed greater economic secu- rity, had attained virtually unchallenged authority in domestic units, and were, in many cases, destined to outlive them. In accounting for the misfortunes of their own generation, some younger people pointed to the continued status and power of elders, which they attrib- uted to witchcraft. They alleged that when their fathers worked as migrant laborers in South Africa's centers of industry and mining during the 1980s, they purchased witch familiars in order to secure promotions and earn good salaries. But once their fathers retired in Bushbuckridge, the familiars caused havoc and claimed the blood of their children. In this manner, fathers inadver- tently sacrificed their children's futures for their own prosperity. For example, Jabulani Mashile retired from working in the gold mines to take up residence with his family in Impalahoek. Within a few years, his wife and five of his children had passed away. Jabulani's remaining descendants claimed that he had bewitched the members of his own family, giving some of them the appearance of AIDS-like symptoms so as not to arouse too much suspicion. Such accusations were bids to sever ties with elders, who frequently blamed AIDS on the unscrupulous sexual conduct of the younger generation, and to construct new relations of intergenerational solidarity, or to reinforce old ones, particularly among siblings. Conclusions In this article, I have attempted to show how a focus on networks, as elaborated in Anderson's (2000, 2008) analysis of the kuru epidemic in Papua New Guinea, can offer valuable analytical insights into witchcraft accusations in Bushbuck- ridge, South Africa. Anderson exhorts us not to view the labeling and the alloca- tion of blame for kuru as a matter of indigenous cosmology, but rather to see it in terms of multiple networks of interaction and exchange. This approach calls for reflexivity and challenges us to consider the manner in which the biomedical and public health fraternities pathologize certain patterns of behavior among host populations. Allegations of cannibalism are a profound marker of primitive exoticism at the frontiers of colonial rule (Obeyesekere 2005). Yet the impact of these allegations on the South Fore is yet to be fully explored, particularly as it pertains to likely contestations between Christians and pagans. It remains unclear whether Christianity generated any new understandings of the body and of death that led to the abandonment of traditional funeral rites and to the refusal of the Fore people to provide corpses for medical autopsies. In the South African lowveld, it is only now that the stigmatizing effects of two decades of AIDS-awareness campaigns, which have highlighted the fatal nature of AIDS and condemned sexual promiscuity, are becoming apparent.</page><page sequence="14">38 I Isak Niehaus In Papua New Guinea, as in South Africa, there is a long tradition of invok- ing sorcery and witchcraft to explain and to allocate responsibility for misfor- tune. But a stubborn commitment to tradition alone does not account for the appeal of witchcraft in the face of new disease epidemics. In both cases, the host populations were perfectly willing to use new explanatory models for misfortune (ranging from germs to ghosts, cargo, and political conspiracies) and to experiment with a wide array of new treatments (using whatever bio- medicine had to offer). In the context of epidemics, accusations of sorcery and witchcraft reconfigured culpability by shifting blame away from the sufferers. Previous ideas of witchcraft as 'projection' offer a useful starting point toward conceptualizing this capacity. This concept refers to processes whereby sub- jects disavow and disconnect from feelings or wishes that they cannot tolerate within themselves- in this case, guilt- and relocate these onto others- in this case, the sorcerer or witch (Kluckhohn 1944). This process is both interper- sonal and relational (Lambek 2002) . It is precisely in the politics of relatedness that witchcraft accusations 'cut' social networks and impose boundaries in an attempt to forge new connections of solidarity, such as those between house- hold members, cognates, and siblings.

Impalahoek was formerly located in the Lebowa Bantustan and currently has a population in excess of 20,000 Northern Sotho- and Tsonga (Shangaan) -speaking residents. 2. My aim is not to establish a universal explanatory framework. It is simply to explore the co-presence of certain phenomena. Lambek and Strathern (1998: 25-28) con- tend that engagement in new contexts, conversations, and exchanges helps us to broaden our horizons and to refine our language. 3. Arens (1979) argues that the theory about cannibalism relies upon verbal testimony, including folk tales. According to Steadman and Merbs (1982), the portal of entry</page><page sequence="15">Kuru, AIDS , and Witchcraft | 39 might well have been through mucus membranes of the skin, for example, by rub- bing the eyes and nose with unwashed hands. 4. In 1997, Gajdusek was convicted of child molestation, following the adoption of more than a dozen boys from Papua New Guinea (Anderson 2008: 220-225). 5. President Mbeki's government opposed calls by physicians to provide azidothy- midine (AZT) and nevirapine (NVP) to women in the last stages of pregnancy to reduce the chances of mother-child transmission of HIV. President Mbeki even became receptive to arguments by dissident scientists who denied the existence of HIV. In 2003, the South African Constitutional Court compelled his government to make NVP available in all sectors of the health-care system to satisfy citizens' 'right to life' (Fassin 2007: 41-49). 6. McPherson et al. (2008) monitored 1,353 patients who received HAART at the Rix- ile clinic between October 2005 and September 2007. Their median CD4 count was 64. After two years, 84 percent (1,131) of the patients were retained on treatment, 9 percent (124) had died, 5 percent (63) had been transferred out, and 3 percent (35) could not be traced.
