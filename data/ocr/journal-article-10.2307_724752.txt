It is assumed that various proposals are put forward and that each member of the community has a definite preference attitude in re- gard to them. Arrow then enquires into the suitability of the procedure by which, from the ballots cast, the community might arrive at an ordering of the proposals which had been put forward and voted on. Or, equally well, it may be on some topic other than economic policy that it is arriving at an or- dering of the proposals put forward and voted on, and we may still regard the community as a committee reaching a decision. Arrow's theory is about the definition of a suitable committee procedure, and about the existence or non- existence of a suitable procedure. The Impossibility Theorem shows that in the general case and apart from restrictions on the members' preferences, no committee procedure will be able *This paper was written while the author was a Research Fellow in Law and Economics in the University of Chicago Law School.

The present article will presuppose no previous knowledge of the theorem and will describe in some detail the conditions which, Arrow suggests, a committee procedure should be required to meet. We then add two conditions of our own, one taking it that the vote of each member of the committee is assigned the same weight, the other that the committee treats all motions on the same basis. These restrictions may serve in some measure to place the theorem in the context of the everyday committee. The important feature, however, is that any procedure open to the committee to use under our more restrictive conditions, remains open to it under the Arrow conditions. We prove the Impossibility Theorem, showing that no committee procedure is able, for all sets of preference schedules, to satisfy the Arrow requirements along with the two we have imposed. The proof points out that, for any given size of committee, a procedure which satisfies the other conditions must, for one or other of two sets of schedules, give rise to an intransitivity, so infringing one of the Arrow requirements. The Impossibility Theorem is formally valid. But we go on to show-con- fining our attention throughout to the case of three motions-that a com- mittee procedure exists which, except for the very small committee, satisfies the other Arrow conditions and gives rise to a fraction of intransitivities so trivial that for every practical purpose it can be disregarded. For instance the fraction of intransitivities for a committee of forty members is less than one millionth that for a committee of twenty members. The procedure which, for all except the small committee, and without re- striction on the members' preferences, satisfies virtually entirely the Arrow conditions, is that of complete unanimity-the committee chooses one motion rather than another, if and only if every member prefers it to the other; and no one is likely to call in question that this procedure would be exceedingly unsuitable for use by any committee. We go on to define certain restrictions on the preferences of the members of the committee which enable the procedure of complete unanimity to achieve full transitivity for the permissible sets of preference schedules. The proce- dure of complete unanimity then satisfies fully all the Arrow requirements. But it would seem to be beyond doubt that the procedure is less suitable in these circumstances than a variety of other procedures which infringe some of the Arrow requirements. That is, the Arrow requirements make a mistake in pronouncing the procedure of complete unanimity to be more suitable than these others. If so, the Arrow requirements must be inappropriate to the task</page><page sequence="3">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 229 assigned to them, namely to discriminate between more suitable and less suit- able procedures. And on this view the Impossibility Theorem would lose its significance. The article is concerned solely with the Impossibility Theorem and no attempt is made to evaluate the signal services to the theory of committees which have been rendered by Arrow's work. THREE ARROW CONDITIONS AND TRANSITIVITY, ALONG WITH Two SIMPLIFYING CONDITIONS Following Professor Arrow we consider a committee consisting of some definite number of members and (for reasons which will be shown3) it will be sufficient to envisage the committee as choosing from among only the three motions which we will designate x, y and z. We assume each member of the committee to have a transitive weak preference ordering in relation to x, y and z. (A transitive weak preference ordering allows the committee member to be indifferent between some of the motions: it corresponds to the case in which, with a set of ordered quantities, we may use the signs &gt;, &lt;, . A transitive strong preference ordering excludes indifference and corre- sponds to the case in which we may use only &gt;, &lt;.) The individual feels preferences but the committee makes decisions. We take it that as between any pair of motions, x and y, say, the committee procedure shall make a definite decision and shall choose x rather than y, or y rather than x, or shall rank x and y equal, and that it shall do so without employing any probability device such as tossing a coin. Let us accept the following three conditions4 which Professor Arrow sug- gests are "apparently reasonable," and seek to impose them along with the requirement of transitivity in decision-making, on any committee procedure which is to be deemed worthy of acceptance. I. Pairwise Comparison ("Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives"). The procedure shall make choices between the motions x and y, . . . , taken pair- wise, and in the choice between x and y, say, the only circumstances taken into account shall be the relative positions of x and y on the preference schedules of the members. This, like the other Arrow conditions, appeals to our intuitive logical no- tions of the conditions which we would desire a committee procedure to satisfy. We can, however, in no sense prove that any of these conditions is a necessary requirement if a committee procedure is to make its choices in 3 See the proof of the Impossibility Theorem infra, p. 236. 4 These were taken from Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1; Public and Private Values, supra note 1, at 15; and Values and Collective Decision-making, supra note 1, at 226.</page><page sequence="4">230 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS a logical or satisfactory manner. The attempt to do so would have to take the form of showing that a condition was grounded in some principle more ultimate than itself, and no such more ultimate ground exists. Although his statement on the subject is brief, Huntington may have some such feature in mind in the paper which introduces the criterion Pairwise Comparison. He is discussing the rank method or Borda count, which awards a motion one mark for each motion that stands below it on a schedule, and deducts one mark for each motion that stands above it on a schedule, and takes the total marks which they score as providing a ranking in order of choice among the motions. He says in connexion with a set of arithmetical examples: "The rank method . . . fails to satisfy the following postulate which may be regarded by many people as a fundamental principle" and then states "the postulate of relevancy"" which corresponds to Pairwise Compari- son. He concludes that his arithmetical examples "may suffice to show that if the postulate of relevancy is accepted, some method other than the method of ranks must be adopted."6 But Huntington, as I understand him, avoids holding that Pairwise Comparison is a necessary requirement in a decision procedure. There is no means of showing any particular requirement or con- dition to be necessary. II. Monotonicity ("Positive Association of Social and Individual Values"). Suppose that for a given group of preference schedules the committee pro- cedure chooses say, x rather than y. Then if another set of schedules can be obtained purely by way of displacing x upwards in relation to y on some of the schedules in the original set, the procedure shall still choose x rather than y for the new set of schedules. Or if, for a given set of schedules, the pro- cedure ranks x and y together, and x is displaced upwards on one or more of the schedules, it shall either continue to rank x and y together, or shall choose x rather than y, but shall not, in these circumstances, choose y rather than x. If, on the other hand, for the initial set of preference schedules the pro- cedure chooses y rather than x, and x is then moved up relative to y on some of the schedules, there is no restriction on the choice that the procedure may now make: it may choose y rather than x, or x rather than y, or may rank the two together. III. Unanimity. If, in any set of schedules, x stands higher than y on the preference schedule of every member, the committee procedure shall choose x rather than y. We might regard Professor Arrow's conditions Monotonicity and Unanimity as being got by the method of minimum interpretation, in answer to the 5 See, E.V.

Only with the utmost reluctance and under compulsion could we abandon either of these conditions; and, doing so, we would be left with the feeling of having moved outside the political realm altogether. We could, it seems to me, attach more weight to either of these conditions than to Pairwise Com- parison or transitivity. IV. One man, one vote (non-labeling of members7). Suppose 3 members of a committee have the preference schedule xyz, 2 members the schedule yxz, and 4 members the schedule zyx. If the com- mittee procedure conforms to this condition, it is immaterial which particular 3 members have the schedule xyz, and so on. For the case of only two motions x and y say, if, in a committee of 15 members, 7 prefer x to y, 3 are indifferent as between x and y and 5 prefer y to x, it is immaterial which particular 7 members prefer x to y, and so on. If so, for a procedure that conforms to condition IV, these data can be set out as (x,y) (7,3,5) and any given procedure which satisfies condition IV will have a unique outcome for every set of schedules that can be specified as (x,y) (7,3,5). Notation. If any given procedure conforms to Pairwise Comparison and condition IV, a set of schedules can, in general, be specified as (x,y) (e,f,g) -x stands higher than y on e schedules, at the same level on f schedules and lower than y on g schedules-which we might also write as (y,x) (g,f,e), along with (y,z) (h,k,l), (x,z) (p,q,r), and so on, and no additional infor- mation about the schedules will affect the outcome of the given procedure. We will also employ the notation x &gt; y or y &lt; x to denote that a given committee procedure chooses x rather than y, and x -=y to denote that the procedure ranks x and y equal in choice, and similarly in regard to any other pair of motions. If, for any set of schedules for which (x,y) (e,f,g), a given procedure chooses x rather than y, that is, has the outcome x &gt; y, we will write this (x,y) (e,f,g) -- x &gt; y. This leaves open the possibility that some other pro- cedure might make a different choice. Likewise in the appropriate circum- stances we may write (y,z) (h,k,l) - y - z, and so on. V. Identity of Treatment of different motions (non-labeling of motions). We take it that any given procedure deals with all motions in the same way. For example if, with a given procedure in use, (x,y) (3,6,2) - x = y, then condition V entails that for this procedure (y,z) (3,6,2) - y = z. Or 7 With regard to this and the following condition, see R. Duncan Luce &amp; Howard Raiffa, Games and Decisions 346-47, 351-52 (1958).</page><page sequence="6">232 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS if, with a given procedure, (x,y) (3,6,2) -&gt; x &lt; y, then (y,z) (3,6,2) -- y &lt; z, and so on. Now let us make the assumption that any given committee procedure yields the result (x,y) (h,k,h)--&gt; x &gt; y. In view of V, the Identity of Treatment of different motions, this would imply (A,B) (h,k,h) -- A &gt; B, where for A and B we are entitled to substitute the names of particular motions. But if we substitute y for A and x for B, we obtain (y,x) (h,k,h) - y &gt; x, that is, (x,y) (h,k,h) -- x &lt; y, which contradicts our original assumption. It is clear that the only possible outcome is (x,y) (h,k,h) -&gt; x = y. IV is a condition of symmetry between members, V a condition of sym- metry between motions, and it can be seen directly from these two conditions that this result is bound to hold. Transitivity, which he terms rationality, is a further condition which, fol- lowing Arrow, we impose on a committee procedure. If, with the 3 motions x, y, z and a given set of schedules, a given procedure chooses x rather than y and ranks y and z equal in choice, that is, gives x &gt; y and y = z, transi- tivity would require x &gt; z and would be satisfied by neither x &lt; z nor x = z, and so on. Viewed in terms of these conditions, the Impossibility Theorem is to the effect that for a set of three motions from which a choice is being made, no committee procedure exists which is able to satisfy all five conditions together with transitivity. Before we go on to prove the theorem it may be worth while, in this ex- pository part of the article (since we believe terminology matters a great deal), to consider Professor Arrow's preference for the term "rationality" to "transitivity." In a discussion of the majority procedure in relation to a set of schedules he says: "A majority prefer A to B, and a majority prefer B to C. . . . If the community is to be regarded as behaving rationally, we are forced to say that A is preferred to C. But in fact a majority of the commu- nity prefer C to A. So the method just outlined for passing from individual to collective tastes fails to satisfy the condition of rationality, as we ordinarily</page><page sequence="7">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 233 understand it. Can we find other methods of aggregating individual tastes which imply rational behaviour on the part of the community and which will be satisfactory in other ways?"8 "Throughout this analysis, it will be assumed that individuals are rational, by which is meant that [their choices are transitive]. . ... The problem will be to construct an ordering relation for society as a whole which is also to reflect rational choice-making."9 Taking first matters of concrete substance, certainly if a decision procedure did not yield transitive choices its practical use would be awkward. To work well in practice a committee procedure must have the appearance of being able to rank the several motions in order of suitability; and a procedure which seemed fairly regularly to hold that A was more suitable than B, B more suitable than C, but C more suitable than A, would, in the committee of ordinary life, get the members confused and would be rejected. But a pro- cedure which did this infrequently might give rise to no more than a tolerable inconvenience. It might be agreed in advance that when an intransitivity arose, the committee would switch to some other procedure which would give a transitive outcome, and this would take care of the purely practical need to arrive at a decision. Nor, as we have said, is there any necessity of a logical nature for insisting that the choice-making by a committee be transi- tive and that transitivity be regarded as an absolute requirement.'? Next, Arrow's preference, as shown in the two quotations above, is for the term "rational" rather than "transitive." As against this we would urge:- (i) Even though the term rational may be useful in discussing the choice- making of the individual-which is not certain-this might be an argument against using it in choice-making by the committee. Rather the need is to get away from all anthropomorphism and consider the committee as a thing sui generis. (ii) "Rational choice" is an emotive term, with the danger that it may induce us to prejudge issues rather than analyse them. In the purely scientific part of a treatment of politics, however, we would wish, so far as possible, to avoid language of this kind and employ only neutral terms. Besides this, the term tends to label alike all procedures which do not secure complete transitivity, whether the intransitivity occurs once in ten cases or once in a hundred million. But, in regard to committee procedures, intransitivity is essentially a quantitative matter, and "irrational" would seem to be a wrong 8 Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 3. 9 A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare, supra note 1, at 334 (reprinted in Readings in Welfare Economics, supra note 1, at 154); and Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 19. to In this we are in agreement with Arrow's position.</page><page sequence="8">234 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS designation of a procedure that gave one intransitivity among a hundred million decisions. (iii) If we employ "rational" as he suggests, we would have, as an in- stance, to say of the Borda count" that it is "rational but infringes Pair- wise Comparison," a position which might call for tedious explanation. (iv) Professor Arrow himself says that the requirement of rationality in a committee procedure is not beyond dispute12-which again seems odd. (v) In Philosophy, where it is more at home than in Economics or Poli- tics, "rational" may carry any of a variety of meanings. (vi) Latterly13 the term used by Professor Arrow has been "collective rationality." This has more content and is still more emotive and less scien- tific than the earlier term. And (vii) to say of a committee procedure that it ensures transitivity or gives rise to a certain fraction of intransitivities, is unambiguous and self- explanatory. If a perfectly satisfactory term exists, there is no need to em- ploy another whose connotation is dubious. On the above grounds, in spite of Professor Arrow's demurrer,14 we our- selves would not wish to regard transitivity and rationality as being equiva- lent terms: there is nothing to be gained from it and perhaps a good deal to be lost. THE IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM THEOREM. For any committee procedure which conforms to conditions I-V (n members in the committee, n &gt; 3), (x,y) (n,0,0) -- x&gt; y (i) (x,y) (0,0,n) -- x &lt;y (ii) (x,y) (h,k,h) -- x = y (iii) and for (n - I) p &gt; r &gt; O0, (n - 1) q &gt; O, (x,y) (p,q,r) -- x &gt; y or x = y (iv) (x,y) (r,q,p) - x &lt; y or x = y (v) 11 Supra page 230. 12 A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare, supra note 1, at 343, n.16 (reprinted in Readings in Welfare Economics, supra note 1, at 164, n.16). 13 See Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 107 (2d ed.); Public and Private Values, supra note 1, at 15; and Values and Collective Decision-making, supra note 1, at 225-26. 14 References to earlier discussion are given in Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 106-08 (2d ed.).</page><page sequence="9">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 235 the sign &lt; in (v) corresponding to the sign &gt; in (iv) and the sign = in (v) corresponding to the same sign in (iv). Let us impose on a committee procedure the conditions I-V. The relation (i) holds, since it is the symbolic expression of the Unanimity condition, and (ii) follows from V, Identity of Treatment of different motions. (iii) has been established above. In (iv) p,q,r are the respective numbers of members who prefer x to y, who rank x and y equal in preference and who prefer y to x; and the limits shown for p,q,r, prescribe that the number of members who prefer x to y is less than n but greater than the number of members who prefer y to x. Then suppose (x,y) (p,q,r) - x &lt; y. Rewriting this, (y,x) (r,q,p) - y &gt; x. By Identity of Treatment of motions, (x,y) (r,q,p) - x &gt; y. But if, in the set of schedules (x,y) (r,q,p), we move x from below to above y on (p - r) schedules, we arrive at the set (x,y) (p,q,r); and, from Monot- onicity, (x,y) (p,q,r) --)x &gt; y. This gives rise to a contradiction and we must abandon the hypothesis from which it springs. That is, (x,y) (p,q,r) - x &gt; y or x = y (iv). Next, from (iv), we have (y,x) (r,q,p) - y &lt; x or y = x; and, from Identity of Treatment of motions, if we interchange the names x and y, (x,y) (r,q,p) - x &lt; y or x = y (v), in which the sign &lt; is associated with the sign &gt; in (iv), and the sign = with the same sign in (iv). If, to (i)-(v), we added a relation expressing the condition Monotonicity, we would obtain a set of relations which is logically equivalent to the con- ditions I-V. For our purposes, however, this is not necessary. THEOREM. The condition "Non-dictatorship" is implied by conditions I-V. Professor Arrow defines a condition'5 Non-dictatorship to be satisfied pro- 15 See A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare, supra note 1, at 339 (reprinted in Readings in Welfare Economics, supra note 1, at 159-60); Social Choice and In- dividual Values, supra note 1, at 30-31; Public and Private Values, supra note 1, at 16; and Values and Collective Decision-making, supra note 1, at 226.</page><page sequence="10">236 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS vided that, for any set of schedules in which x stands above y on only a single schedule and y stands above x on all the rest, the procedure does not choose x rather than y. In symbols, the condition Non-dictatorship is satisfied provided. (x,y) (1,0,n - 1) -- x &lt; y or x = y. Now any committee procedure subject to the conditions I-V satisfies the relations (i)-(v), and the set of schedules (x,y) (1,0, n - 1) is a particular instance of the set (x,y) (r,q,p), with r &lt; p, etc. Hence the conditions I-V ensure that (x,y) (1,0,n -1) -- x &lt; y or x = y, and the condition Non-dictatorship is satisfied. Thus this is not an inde- pendent condition but is implied by the five other conditions chosen above. The Impossibility Theorem. For any given procedure which satisfies con- ditions I-V, at least one set of schedules exists which gives rise to an intran- sitivity (n members, n&gt; 3; 3, or more than 3, motions). It will be sufficient to prove the theorem for the case of 3 motions since, when Pairwise Comparison applies, an intransitivity for this case will recur in precisely the same form when these 3 motions form part of a larger number. Since the given committee procedure conforms to the conditions I-V, the above relations (i)-(v) hold, where p,q,r have the limits shown; and we will prove that, for any size of committee, whether for n odd or n even, any committee procedure subject to these relations gives an intransitivity for at least one set of schedules. x y z y x z y z x x y x z x y z z y 1 1 s+ 1 s s+2 s+1 Figure 1 Figure 2 n odd. Any odd integer n ? 3, is expressible as n- = 3 + 2s, s an in- teger ? 0. Hence for a committee with an odd number of members, one set of schedules that exists is that of Figure 1, in which 1 member prefers x to y and y to z, 1 member prefers y to z and z to x, (s + 1) members prefer z to x and x to y, and s members prefer y to x and x to z. This set of schedules gives:</page><page sequence="11">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 237 (x,y) (s + 2, 0, s + 1) --+ x &gt; y or x - y (y,z) (s 2, 0, s + 1) - y &gt; z or y - z (x,z) (s + 1, 0, s + 2) -- x &lt; z or x = z, where the signs that apply in the successive lines are either &gt;, &gt;, &lt;, or If (x,y)(s+ 2, 0, s ?) -- x &gt; y, we get x &gt; y,y&gt; z,x &lt; z and anin- transitivity occurs. But if (x,y) (s + 2, 0, s + 1) -- x -y, we get x = y, y - z, x - z and there is no intransitivity. In this latter case, however, con- sider the set of schedules of Figure 2. This gives: (x,y) (n,0,0) -- x &gt; y (y,z) (s - 2, 0, s -1) -- y = z (x,z) (s + 2, 0, s + 1) --x z and an intransitivity occurs. Thus for any given committee procedure that satisfies conditions I-V, in all instances for n odd, either the set of schedules of Figure 1 or that of Figure 2 gives an intransitivity. x y z x z y z x y x z x y z y 2 t+1 t-+1 t+-3 t 1I Figure 3 Figure 4 n even. Any even integer n 4, is expressible as n = 4 + 2t, t an in- teger ? 0. Hence for a committee with an even number of members, one set of schedules that exists is that of Figure 3. This gives: (x,y) (t + 3, 0, t + 1) - x &gt; y or x - y (y,z) (t + 3, 0, t + ) - y &gt; z or y = z (x,z) (2, 0, 2t + 2) -- x - z or x &lt; z, where the same sign, &gt; or =, applies in each of the first two lines, and either of the signs = or &lt; may apply in the third. If the sign &gt; applies in the first two lines, then whether for x-- z or x &lt; z, an intransitivity occurs. If, in the first two lines, we take x = y, y = z, an intransitivity occurs for x &lt; z. The only remaining case is that in which we take x - y, y = z, x - z, when no intransitivity occurs for this set of schedules. But consider for</page><page sequence="12">238 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS this case, in which (x,y) (t + 3, 0, t + 1) -&gt; x = y, the set of schedules of Figure 4. This gives: (x,y) (n, 0, 0) -- x &gt; y (y,z) (t + 3, 0, t + 1) - y z (x,z) (t + 3, 0, t + 1) -x = z, which creates an intransitivity. Thus for any given committee procedure that satisfies conditions I-V, for n even, either the set of schedules of Figure 3 or that of Figure 4 gives an intransitivity, and this completes the proof. This establishes the Impossibility Theorem for a procedure which satisfies the conditions I-V: no procedure is able to satisfy these conditions and give transitivity in its choices for all sets of schedules. The conditions IV and V that we have imposed, One man one vote and Identity of Treatment of all motions, place restrictions on the form that the committee procedure may take. Removal of these restrictions opens up to the committee two-stage, three-stage procedures and a vast range of additional procedures. But Arrow's Theorem in its most general form shows the con- clusion still to hold, that no procedure exists which, for all sets of schedules, is able to satisfy conditions I-III together with transitivity. THE PROCEDURE OF COMPLETE UNANIMITY IN RELATION TO THE ARRow CONDITIONS The Arrow paradox is that any procedure which satisfies the conditions I-III, or in our version I-V, must, for some sets of schedules, give rise to an intransitivity. The importance of intransitivity, with any given procedure, can be taken as being proportional to the frequency of its occurrence. The occurrence of an intransitivity on the average for, say, one set of schedules in ten, would certainly be important, but the occurrence for one set of sched- ules in a million would certainly be unimportant.'6 Let us accept it that the important attributes of a committee procedure are those which Professor Arrow sets out, and that our objective is to achieve these attributes in a procedure so far as possible. One way of doing this is to choose the (non-empty) set of procedures which satisfy the conditions I-V completely, and then select from this set the procedure which satisfies, so far as possible, the further requirement of transitivity. It can be shown that the only procedures which satisfy the conditions I-V 16 See Professor Gordon Tullock in James M. Buchanan &amp; Gordon Tullock, The Calculus of Consent 334 (1962) which provides the strand of thought which is here being followed.</page><page sequence="13">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 239 are the simple-majority procedure and the various special-majority proce- dures, provided that in none of these is the chairman given a casting vote (or of course any other procedure, say one which makes use of a system of computation, which is equivalent to one of these majority procedures)- together with the procedure of complete unanimity which also satisfies the conditions I-V. This procedure is defined, where p,q,r have the limits shown at page 235 supra, by the relations (x,y) (n,0,0) - x&gt; y (x,y) (0,0,n) -- x &lt; y (x,y) (h,k,h) -x - y (x,y) (p,q,r) -- x = y (x,y) (r,q,p) -- x = y; that is, as between any two motions, the one defeats the other if, and only if, it stands higher than the other on the schedule of every member of the com- mittee, and apart from this case the procedure ranks the two motions equal in choice. This procedure of complete unanimity is quite distinct from the type of unanimity procedure in which, in a vote between them, x defeats y provided some members of the committee vote for x and none vote for y, giving x a unanimous verdict over y although some members may abstain from voting. Under the procedure of complete unanimity, however, x will defeat y only if every member of the committee votes for x against y. Com- plete unanimity satisfies the condition of Non-dictatorship, since if only a single member in it prefers x to y, while all the others prefer y to x, the committee cannot choose x rather than y: but the single member who pre- fers x to y can prevent y from being chosen, although this is the preference of all the other members; and, whether these be ten or ten million in number, the committee would rank x and y equal in choice. Complete unanimity has a strong kinship with the liberum veto which wrought havoc in the Polish diet from the middle of the seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth.17 It is an odd enough procedure and one which rarely can have been used in real life, and yet it satisfies completely the conditions, apart from transitivity, 17 See the article Poland in any edition of The Encyclopaedia Britannica from the eleventh to the present. Under the liberum veto any motion to change the status quo was defeated if a single member of the diet called out "I disapprove," and legislative change became almost impossible. A writer in 1855 termed this procedure "certainly the greatest curiosity, in the shape of a political institution, with which the records of any nation present us." J. N. Lamed, 4 History for Ready Reference from the best Historians, Biographers, and Specialists 2617 (1901). The procedure of complete unanimity, ranking practically all motions equal in choice, would be more confusing than the liberum veto.</page><page sequence="14">240 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS of Social Choice and Individual Values, and also the conditions I-V above. Not only so, but it seems fairly certain on the basis of common-sense con- siderations that, of all the procedures which meet the conditions I-V, com- plete unanimity satisfies the remaining requirement of transitivity more fully than any other. We proceed to compute the fraction of intransitivities for this procedure for the case in which all members of the committee have strong preference orderings and the committee is confronted with 3 motions to be ranked in order of choice. We will set out our working briefly since the technique used has been described very clearly by David Klahr.1s THEOREM. With the procedure of complete unanimity, the fraction of intransitivities for a committee of n members (3 motions, strong preference orderings) is 3n - 2n+1+ 1 6n-1 x x y y z z y z z x x y z y x z y x p q r s t u Figure 5 Proof. The preference schedule of any member must be one of the 3! = 6 schedules shown in Figure 5, with p + q + r -+- s + t +- u = n. We may regard each member of the committee, the first member A, the second member B, and so on, as corresponding to a pigeon-hole in which we place a schedule, and we take it that each schedule has the same probability of occurrence. Since we may fill the first pigeon-hole with any of the 6 schedules, the second with any of the 6 schedules, and so on, the total num- ber of distinct sets (permutations) of schedules that arise is 6n. Let us now compute the number of these sets of schedules which give rise to an intransitivity. With the procedure of complete unanimity in use, no intransitivity of the type x&gt; y, y&gt; z, z &gt; x can arise, because x &gt; y, y &gt; z would require that all n schedules be xyz, in which case x &gt; z. With x &gt; y the only type of intransitivity that can occur is x &gt; y, y = z, x =-z; 18 David Klahr, A Computer Simulation of the Paradox of Voting, 60 Amer. Pol. Sci. Rev. 384 (1966).</page><page sequence="15">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 241 and apart from this an intransitivity can be got only by one of the 5 cyclic changes of these motions, for example y &gt; z, z x, y =- x, and so on. This gives in all 6 possible types of intransitivity. Suppose the intransitivity is x &gt; y, y-= z, x =- z. Then with the procedure of complete unanimity in use, x must stand higher than y on every schedule and the set of schedules can be only of the type shown in Figure 6, subject, as will be seen on reflection,19 to 1 ?p &lt;n- 1,0 5 q-&lt;n- 2, 1 &lt; t'&lt;n- 1, p-- q + t = n. x x z y z x z y y p q t Figure 6 If we show between braces {p,q,t), the number of the first, second and third of these schedules of Figure 6, the different combinations of schedules that gave rise to the intransitivity x &gt; y, y = z, x - z, can be specified as: {n - 1, 1, {n, 1 n - 2,0, 0, 2, n - 3, 0, 3),..., {1, 0, n - 1} {n-2,1,1}, {n-3,1,2),..., (1,1,n-2} {n- 3,2, 1), ..., {1, 2, n- 3} {1, n-- 2, 1}. Next, {p, q, t} is a combination of n schedules of which p are the same, q are the same and t are the same; and this combination gives rise to n! separate permutations of schedules. Hence the total number of p! q! t! permutations of schedules which give rise to the intransitivity is n! (n-i1)! 0! 1! n! n! n! (n - 2)! 0! 2! (n - 3)! 0! 3! 1! 0! (n-- 1)! n! n! n! (n --2)! 1! 1! (n - 3)! 1! 2!1! 1! (n-2)! 19 Alternatively, this can be proved deductively.

Working to three digits, the fraction for a com- mittee of 24 members will be 1/8 of that for 21 members, for a committee of 31 members will be 1/210 = 1/1024 of that for a committee of 21 mem- bers, and the fraction for a committee of 41 members will be less than one millionth of that for a committee of 21 members, and so on. With the procedure of complete unanimity in use and more than 3 mo- tions, additional types of intransitivity become possible, but we must leave it to the mathematicians to investigate whether, with an increase in the number of motions, the fraction of intransitivities increases or diminishes. THEOREM. For strong preference orderings, with the procedure of com- plete unanimity in use, the fraction of clear first choices for 3 motions is 1/3"-1 and for m motions is 1/m"-1 (2 ? m, n members in the committee). The object of a committee procedure is to select the most suitable of the motions that come before it, and a highly desirable property in a procedure is that it shall make a clear first choice and that if the motions are x, y, z, w it shall pronounce one, y say, to be more suitable than any of the others. It is far less important that it should make a strong choice ordering among the remaining motions and it might, with little inconvenience, rank say, x and w together as being next most suitable in choice. A procedure which fails to discriminate a particular motion as being more suitable than any of the others, leaves the committee with the need to make a further choice. This could be done only by employing some fresh procedure. If the committee has before it the 3 motions x, y, z, we define a "clear first choice" in favour of x to be a decision of the type x &gt; y, x &gt; z, and corre- spondingly in other cases. w w w w w w x x x x y y z z x y z y z z x x y y z y z y x z y x n p q p q r s t u Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 With the procedure of complete unanimity in use, given the 2 motions x, y and strong preference orderings, a clear first choice in favour of x arises only from a set of schedules (Figure 7) in which all n members prefer x to y. Only a single set (permutation) of schedules is of this kind, out of the total (2!)n= 2" permutations which are possible. The fraction of cases in</page><page sequence="18">244 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS 1 which x is the clear first choice of the committee is -; and the fraction in 1 which either x or y is the clear first choice is - 2n-1 Given the 3 motions x, y, z and strong orderings, a clear first choice in favor of x results only from a set of schedules of the type of Figure 8, in which x stands at the top of each schedule and (p + q) = n. To get the total number of sets of schedules of this kind, we need only permute the parts of the schedules below x, and the total number of permutations is (2! )n - 2n. The same number of permutations corresponds to a clear first choice in favour of y or z. Hence the total number of permutations giving rise to a clear first choice is 3.2n and the fraction of clear first choices is 3.2n/(3!)n = 1/3-1. With 4 motions x, y, z, w and strong orderings, a clear first choice in favour of w results only from a set of schedules of the type of Figure 9. The total number of permutations giving a clear first choice in favour of one or other of the motions is 4(3!)n/(4!)n = 1/4n-1. It is obvious that for m motions the fraction of clear first choices in favour of one or other of the motions is 1/m"n. In each case, with the procedure of complete unanimity in use, whether for 2 motions or more, the fraction of clear first choices con- verges rapidly to zero as the number of members in the committee increases. In Table 1 the second column shows the percentage of intransitivities for the smaller sizes of committee with the procedure of complete unanimity, and, for comparison, the third column shows the percentage of intransitivities with the simple majority in use, these latter figures being taken from a paper by Mark B. Garman and Morton I. Kamien.20 The fourth column shows the percentage of clear first choices given by the complete-unanimity procedure. For a committee with an odd number of members using a simple majority, the percentage of clear first choices is 100 minus the percentage of intransi- tivities shown in the third column. For all practical purposes the procedure of complete unanimity ceases to give rise to intransitivities for a committee of say, fifteen members or more; and, by increasing the size of the committee, the fraction of intransitivities can be made as small as we choose. Thus for the case of 3 motions, the pro- cedure of complete unanimity satisfies all the Arrow conditions, as well as the restrictions IV and V that we imposed, and satisfies virtually completely, for any except the small committee, the further requirement of transitivity. At the same time, for a committee of say, eight members or more, it almost 20 Mark B. Garman &amp; Morton I.

J. 853 (1965).</page><page sequence="19">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 245 ceases to discriminate in choice between the different motions and simply pronounces x = y = z, and a procedure of this kind would be intolerable. If we exclude the case of the small committee, no one, we can safely take it, would regard complete unanimity as having any claims to being a suitable committee procedure. Moreover, since, with m motions before the committee and strong preference orderings, the fraction of clear first choices is 1/mn-, this procedure becomes less tolerable the greater the number of motions the committee is asked to adjudicate on. The general conception of Social Choice and Individual Values is that we might envisage the community after the manner of a direct democracy in which each person is assumed to have a definite preference attitude to the proposals put forward in relation to economic policy. The policy adopted by the community is to be determined by the votes of the people, and the prob- lem is to ensure that the committee procedure shall be suitable for the task to which it is put. To do this, it is suggested, a committee procedure should be employed possessing the attributes we have described. But it seems to follow from our quantitative theorems that, for a large community choosing from among 3 motions, it would be a matter of ease to satisfy the Arrow requirements. This could be done almost fully by employing the procedure of complete unanimity, but that would be no solution of the practical problem. Furthermore, we can specify, for the case of 3 motions, restrictions on the members' preferences which enable the procedure of complete unanimity to satisfy the Arrow requirements entirely. With strong preference orderings the total number of permutations of the schedules for a committee of n members is 6n. From these exclude all sets of schedules of the type in Figure 6, which give rise to the intransitivities x &gt; y, y= z, x - z, and so on. In all this excludes the 6(31 - 2"+1+- 1) sets of schedules for which an intransitivity can occur. For the remaining {6n - 6(3n --2n + 1)) } sets of schedules, the procedure of complete unanimity meets fully the Arrow requirements, whether for the small or the large committee. But its real drawbacks remain, and, in spite of the Arrow requirements being fully met, no one is likely to regard complete unanimity as being in these circumstances other than an unsuitable procedure--one which is less suitable than others which are available. INTERPRETATION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM After his proof of the theorem by the methods of Symbolic Logic, Professor Arrow gives this interpretation of it: The only methods of passing from individual tastes to social preferences which will be satisfactory . . . are either imposed or dictatorial. The word "satisfactory" in the above statement means that the social welfare</page><page sequence="20">246 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS function does not reflect individuals' desires negatively [infringing Monotonicity] . .. and that the resultant social tastes shall be represented by . . . [a transitive] ordering. . . . It will continue to be maintained . .. that the conditions wrapped up in the word "satisfactory" are to be accepted.21 Some brief comment may be offered in connexion with this passage. The quaesitum in the theory of committees is a suitable committee procedure, and various criteria are selected with a view to discerning which procedures are more suitable and which less suitable: they correspond to attributes that we want a procedure to possess. The question then becomes: Which proce- dures, if any, possess the attributes that we desire? In the common usage of words a procedure will certainly be termed suitable if it satisfies which- ever tests are thought appropriate, so that it possesses all of the desired attributes: and in the event of a procedure being able to satisfy some but not all of the tests, a common usage would be to describe it as being suitable in regard to the particular tests it can meet. In Arrow's usage a procedure is satisfactory if, and only if, it can meet the conditions of Monotonicity and transitivity. The difficulty to which this gives rise is that a procedure may be satisfactory in the Arrow sense, with the possibility that it will be un- suitable in so far as it fails to meet some of his other conditions. The Borda count, for instance, satisfies Monotonicity and transitivity and so is satis- factory in the Arrow sense, but it infringes Pairwise Comparison and Arrow regards it as unsuitable. The main issue which we must consider, however, is the significance of the Impossibility Theorem. Arrow had set up his conditions with a view to the choice of a suitable committee procedure, or to discriminating between those procedures which are more suitable and those which are less suitable. In Social Choice and Individual Values he terms a procedure which meets all his requirements a social welfare function, or a "suitable social welfare function,"22 or a "valid social welfare function"23 or a "satisfactory social welfare function,"24 but these other terms are equivalent to a social welfare function. Later25 he termed a procedure which was able to meet his require- ments a "constitution." 21 See A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare, supra note 1, at 342-43 (reprinted in Readings in Welfare Economics, supra note 1, at 163-64); Social Choice and In- dividual Values, supra note 1, at 59-60. 22 Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 81. 231d. at 77. 24 Id. at 69. 25 Id. at 104-05 (2d ed.); Public and Private Values, supra note 1; and Values and Collective Decision-making, supra note 1.</page><page sequence="21">ON ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM 247 He takes the Impossibility Theorem as showing that, in the absence of restrictions on the members' preferences, no social welfare function exists. He goes on to show26 that if we impose the restriction that the members' preferences can be represented by single-peaked curves, a method of ma- jority decision will exist, for a committee with an odd number of members, that is a social welfare function. And he suggests27 that, with other restric- tions on the members' preferences, it may be possible to discover other social welfare functions. But consider the procedure of complete unanimity for the case in which the committee has before it 3 motions and the members' preferences are re- stricted in the way we have described (supra, page 245), so that no intran- sitivity can occur. The judgment of anyone who understands the issues, it seems to us, must be that this procedure is less suitable than say, the Borda count, or a simple-majority procedure, or any of a variety of other pro- cedures which it would be possible to specify and which infringe the con- ditions I-V or transitivity. The individual making this judgment in fact prefers a committee procedure which is not a social welfare function to one that is a social welfare function. Now the logic of the argument is this. The conditions I-V together with transitivity accept as suitable the procedure of complete unanimity, in the circumstances in which the members' preferences are restricted so that no intransitivity occurs, and reject as unsuitable say, the Borda count which infringes Pairwise Comparison, or a simple-majority procedure which in- fringes transitivity-although on the basis of the theory developed above, as also on common-sense grounds, it would seem almost impossible to doubt that either of these or any of a variety of other procedures would be more suitable than that of complete unanimity. The choice of complete unanimity in preference to any of a number of other procedures which are available, would seem quite plainly to be a mistake. If so, the conditions I-V together with transitivity, from which this wrong choice arises, must themselves be mistaken or inappropriate. Further, the same mistaken choice is made by the Arrow conditions I-III together with transitivity, which accept the procedure of complete unanimity and reject, say, the Borda count, a simple-majority procedure, and so on. Since they can lead to what would appear to be clearly a wrong decision, the Arrow conditions I-III together with transitivity, must be rejected as inappropriate to the problem of the choice of a suitable committee procedure, or the choice of a more suitable rather than a less suitable procedure. From this two main conclusions follow:- 26 See Social Choice and Individual Values, supra note 1, at 75-80. 27 Id. at 83.</page><page sequence="22">248 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS (i) A social welfare function is a committee procedure which, when the members' preferences are subject to certain restrictions, is able to satisfy the Arrow conditions. But since the Arrow conditions are themselves inappro- priate, the social welfare function concerned may be unsuitable as a com- mittee procedure. A social welfare function need not necessarily be chosen in preference to a procedure which is not a social welfare function. And (ii) the Impossibility Theorem shows that no committee procedure is able to satisfy the Arrow requirements for all sets of preferences. But since these requirements are themselves inappropriate, the fact that no committee procedure is able to satisfy them for all sets of preferences would seem to have no determinate significance.</page></plain_text>
