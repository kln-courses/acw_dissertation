<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conrad in the Nineteenth Century by Ian Watt. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1979. Pp. xvii + 375. $21.50. Ignoring the deconstruotive fibrillations of Derrida, the archeological pyro technic displays of Foucault, and all similar innovations, Ian Watt gives us a plain, unvarnished Conrad. The elusive Kurtz in Heart of Darkness originates with the agent Klein whom Conrad saw dying on the Congo steamer Roi des Beiges. Yet, there is an overlay of Arthur Eugene Constant Hodister, a reformer who was director of the Syndicat Commercial du Katanga for a time. Yet, again, Kurtz differs from both Klein and Hodister while showing similiarities to numerous other celebrities: Emin Pasha (born Eduard Schnitzer 1840-92), Major Musgrave Barttelot, and Charles Henry Stokes (141-45). Watt follows his method thoroughly and judiciously. He tries to find the origin of Conrad's fiction in his experience, carefully sifting other scholars' scattered evidence. Within the limits of Watt's plan, his work will stand as one of the most important studies of Conrad. Watt's unswerving adherence to his method is both the strength and the weakness of his work. Beginning with a sketch of Conrad's earlier life (1857-94), Watt defines several</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 387 ways in which Conrad was a man divided, homo duplex. The outlines of this period are well-known: Conrad's family's sufferings as a result of his father's opposition to the Czarist rule of Poland, his Uncle Bobrowski's constant scolding about the boy's irresponsible ways, his apparently self-inflicted wound in Marseilles. In these experiences Watt locates the major themes of Conrad's fiction: his pessimistic perspective, his distrust of bourgeois values, his concern to transcend Byronic indivdualism to reach a larger loyalty, his interest in doomed resistance, heroic defeat, and fidelity. These themes set Conrad apart from other English novelists of his time and are rooted in his personal experience as well as in the literature of his native Poland. Conrad is torn by emotional and intellectual contradiction. His painfully created fiction is his attempt to resolve these anxieties. Watt believes that in the face of all forces which dwarf individual human effort, Conrad clings to the moral imperative of " solidarity" or commitment. As Conrad himself noted, his theme is fidelity. Watt devotes a chapter each to explication of four works written in the 19th century (Almayer's Folly, The Nigger of the Narcissus, Heart of Darkness, and Lord Jim). When the curious reader turns to the series of Concordances and Verbal Indexes to these works by Conrad, it is a bit surprising to see that the word solidarity does not occur at all in Almayer's Folly, nor Heart of Darkness, and the single occurrence in Lord ]im does not refer to human relation ships. The theme unifying these four works is undenominated in the texts. Intuitively, most readers feel that there is a process of development evident in these four works. Clearly the shapeliness and economy of Heart of Darkness is of superior quality to the interesting but slack first novel, Almayer's Folly. Watt's explanation of this development is not completely satisfying. Almayer himself, of course, originates in the Dutch trader Olmeijer and the topography of Conrad's Sambir reflects actual settlements astride the Berau river. The fiction transforms these experiences to conform to " current market formulae" (43), which are contradicted by a drive toward the very serious French models of Flaubert and Maupassant, so that " Almayer is a Borneo Bovary" (51). These aims are incompatible, for the reader luxuriates in the romantic fantasies of Nina, while ridiculing her father's inability to escape from his dreams. Watt sees this problem as primarily commercial. Conrad was trying to reach a much larger audience than Flaubert and so he created " the more serious issues" (55) embedded in a cocoon of moonshine. He also notes that Conrad's English is a bit awkward in his first novel in its sentence structure, repetition, and over-qualification; and he observes that Conrad's prose becomes more fluent with each succeeding book. Finally, he sees Conrad as using the ironical stance of Flaubert to evade confronting the problems in the character of Almayer which were painful for the author personally. In The Nigger of the Narcissus Watt sees a sharpening of thematic focus, which can be clarified by ideas stated by Emile Durkheim's De la division du travail social, even though it is unlikely that Conrad had read this work. Durkheim argues that the division of labor in modern society creates an organic unity. In order for such a group to function, it must have a concensus of values and attitudes. Watt sees The Nigger of the Narcissus as the examination of organic unity, the ship's crew, under such extreme stress that its solidarity</page><page sequence="3">388 Book Reviews crumbles into a state of anoviie, to use Durkheim's vocabulary. The figure of old Singleton, after thirty hours, still steering at the wheel of the ship is Conrad's affirmation of "The ultimate and universal basis of human solidarity" (125). The diachronic movement Watt is tracing in Conrad's works appears to be a process of clarifying the author's ideology. Aimayer's Folly involves issues which are clarified to some degree in The Nigger of the Narcissus and which will become even clearer in the masterpieces Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim. While readers may agree that Heart of Darkness crackles with a power, found only faintly pulsing in the earlier works, it is not so obvious that Heart of Darkness compels because of its ideological sharpness. Is Heart of Darkness remarkable because it is Conrad's "ideological summa" (148)? When Watt turns to Heart of Darkness his study repeatedly turns up matters of biographical and historical fact which significantly color our understanding of the text: when Conrad began to write for Blackwoods, he acquired a new sense of audience; in the current myth of " going native," Conrad might see the process of his own denationalization; in the vision of the Imperial mission in popular writers like Kipling and Rider Haggard, the virtues of duty, military discipline, and technological efficiency provide the assumptions scrutinized in Conrad's story. Watt is less satisfactory in dealing with the problem of normative judgment in the work. If this text sums up Conrad's worthwhile thinking on historical and social problems, why is it finally so opaque, so inconclusive? The argument that "inconsistencies in Conrad's attitudes to colonial and racial problems must in general be understood in their historical context" (160) does not explain why modern readers should find an "incon sistent " ideological position gratifying. Watt's judgment that " Heart of Darkness... endure (s) as the most powerful indictment of imperialism" (161), is not self-evidently true. Marlow, in the final scene, does lie to the Intended bride of Kurtz, so concealing the true horror of the European presence in Africa. Conrad, too, does not publish his diary of horrible observed facts in the Congo, but softens these facts into fictional ambiguities for public consumption. To account for the improvement of Heart of Darkness over Almayefs Folly, we must acknowledge that Heart of Darkness is systematically obscure, and that growing obscurity does not fit easily into the theory that Conrad's works are best when most ideologically incisive. Watt explains the artful ambiguity of Heart of Darkness as the consequence of Impressionism and Symbolism. Literary impressionism has been the subject of lively discussion for at least the last decade. Watt refers to the " Preliminary Papers " distributed for seminar # 8 at the 1975 annual convention of the Modern Language Association. In fact, there have been five seminars in the last six years discussing this topic, as well as recent books on impressionism in Stephen Crane, Henry James, and Chekov. Watt's judgment that " it is very unlikely that Conrad either thought of himself as an impressionist or was significantly influenced by the impressionist movement" (179) is, at best, only partially correct. Watt's study plays down the impact of Ford on Conrad and does not see the full implication of Conrad's move toward an ambiguously structured text, demand ing a highly constructive role of the reader. Watt's consideration of the phenomenology of art is deficient. He treats language under the realist assumption</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 389 that it refers to an external subject, such as the Belgian occupation of the Congo. He also considers the possibility that language is expressive of certain mental states and anxieties in the author's or in a character's mind. But he rarely looks at a text as an experience. This is a serious shortcoming in any critical survey of a piece of literature, but it is especially crippling if the author in question is apparently a pioneer in exploring the use of language as a model of perception and as a means to manipulate the reader's process of reading or his encounter with the artifact of the text. Given Watt's method of analysis, his examination of the biography of the author and his definition of how the text refers to historical situations, it is natural that he should conclude, "What makes reading Heart of Darkness so unforgettable is surely the harrowing power with which Conrad convinces us of the essential reality of everything that Marlow sees and feels" (252). Working on the theory that stridency of assertion always rises when the speaker's doubt in his position increases, we are suspicious of the words "is surely." How is " essential reality" different from just plain " reality" ? We can certainly imagine the opposite assertion, that the reader is captivated by Conrad's work because he is constantly reminded that it is a fiction, a tale told by Marlow on the Nellie, twice-told by the outside " I" narrator to us. If we want to get near " reality," why not read Conrad's Congo diary? Take the entry of 3 July, " Met an off (icer) of the State inspecting. A few minutes afterwards saw at a camp(ing) place the dead body of a Backongo. Shot? Horrid smell." These lines are a good bit nearer the historical reality than the inconclusive fiction of Marlow, yet they lack the power of the verbal artifice, the conventions of fiction which Conrad constantly manipulates precisely to remind his audience that they are reading a story. Consider Watt's anthropomorphic assumption in sentences like these: Lord Jim " may even have identified with Brown to the extent that he thought that, like himself, Brown ought to be given another chance" (342, italics added). It is not unusual for Watt to vivify characters when he summarizes stories, constructing what these characters must have been thinking, what their motives must have been, imputing a life to them independent of the words of the text, like studying what Hamlet's curriculum at the University of Wittenberg must have been before the play began. So long as the reader knows that he is participating in an activity, generated in him by the manipulation of conventions in the story, and knows that literary characters do not really have thoughts and motives beyond those stated by the text, such constructions are quite properly part of the experience of the artifact. But as an explanation of the artistic power of the work, Watt is on much sounder ground when he acknowledges that Conrad had a theory for manipulating an effect in his reader and that he marshalled the techniques of delayed encoding, symbolic deciphering, and anachronic oscillation to that end. But if we grant that " there is little question that Conrad conceived his fiction in terms of a planned sequence of effects on the reader" (306), how does his practice square with the aims of the naive moralist? Is Conrad's work powerful because he discovered gradually that in this hostile world man must maintain his solidarity, his fidelity, to what appear to be shortsighted goals of</page><page sequence="5">390 Book Reviews conduct (as Watt seems to argue on p. 125) or is it powerful because the artful author contrives verbal effects which let his reader glimpse only partially, and hidden in a mist of anachronic oscillation and unreliable narration, his kernel of truth? Watt wants Conrad to give us maxims to live by, like Tom Brovm's School Days. But what the critic of Conrad must explain is why we continue to read his work when it is most cunningly contrived to make the extraction of such maxims from the text virtually impossible.
