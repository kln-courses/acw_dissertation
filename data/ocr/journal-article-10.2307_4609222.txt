<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN STEINBECK,CALIFORNIAN By FREEMAN CHAMPNEY JOHN STEINBECK is one of the few American writers who can be dis- cussed in both past and present. He has done important work for fifteen years or so and he is still developing and experimenting. So much criticism and analysis of his work have been published that writing any more seems a little silly-we have several times as many passable literary critics now as we have halfway good creators. But most of the critics are Easterners and have discussed Steinbeck's books with little or no knowledge of the country in which he grew up and which he writes about. Even a casual direct contact with this country and its people sug- gests that this background is the most important thing to know about Steinbeck and that it explains much of his writing better than any amount of remote analysis. It also explains things about the East by comparison and contrast. The Salinas Valley roughly parallels the coast, thirty miles or so in- land, for most of its length of about a hundred and twenty miles. It is one of the smaller of California's central valleys, which run up and down the state between mountain ranges. The enclosing hills have the steep slopes and the barren, rounded crests which have evoked so many anatomical comparisons. During much of the year they are brown and dry, turning green during the rainy winter. The river, the highway, and the Southern Pacific Railroad chase each other down the valley floor. The river itself, like most California rivers, is normally sandy, brush-choked, and nearly dry but carries a great volume of floodwater when the big rains come. At the lower end of the valley the flat bottomland is cut into great fields of lettuce, broccoli, alfalfa, sugar beets, and other truck crops. Cattle are raised on the slopes of the hills. Salinas (where Steinbeck was born and raised) is about ten miles inland from the river's mouth in Monterey Bay. It is the county seat and the trading and shipping center for the lower part of the valley. It looks a little more metropolitan than the raw valley towns but not much more. 345</page><page sequence="2">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW Cattle-raising has been a valley occupation since the days of the mis- sions but the intensive cultivation of vegetables-especially lettuce, which takes up more than 50,000 acres-has outranked it in importance for some time. But the nostalgic glamor of the cowhand days is clung to. You see fifty lean men in sombreros, tight jeans, and riding boots for every visible horse. Once a year Salinas stages "California's Biggest Rodeo" and cashes in handsomely on its nostalgia. Lettuce, however, is the big industry of the valley, and its growing, packing, and shipping follow the highly capitalized pattern of California agriculture that Carey McWilliams has accurately called "Factories in the Field." In 1936 a strike by lettuce packing shed workers was crushed at a cost of around a quarter of a million dollars. Civil liberties, local government, and normal judicial processes were all suspended during the strike and Salinas was governed by a general staff directed by the Associated Farmers and the big lettuce growers and shippers. The local police were bossed by a reserve army officer imported for the job and at the height of the strike all male residents of Salinas between I8 and 45 were mobilized under penalty of arrest, were deputized and armed. Beat- ings, tear gas attacks, wholesale arrests, threats to lynch San Francisco newspapermen if they didn't leave town, and machine guns and barbed wire all figured in the month-long struggle which finally broke the strike and destroyed the union. So much for John Steinbeck's birthplace, where he lived his first nineteen years. From Salinas it is about fifteen miles through a pass in the Santa Lucia Range to the Monterey Peninsula. This fantastic area contains some of the most picturesque country in the world and an assort- ment of humanity almost as bizarre and much less permanent. Monterey i-tself is tough and raucous. Its harbor shelters the purse-seiners of the sardine fleet; farther west the shore is solid with the processing plants (Cannery Row) that receive the catch. The fishermen and cannery work- ers are Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, a few Chinese, and the paisanos of Tortilla Flat. Nearby is the army post of Fort Ord and the main busi- ness section along Alvarado Street is thick with ratty-looking bars. Sardine fishing and the canneries are highly speculative, feast-or-famine affairs. Beyond this variable economic base, Monterey has its honkeytonks for the military and a considerable volume of tourist business (they come to see 346</page><page sequence="3">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN the fishing boats and the historic adobes and absorb the legends of the rancho and mission days). Just west of Cannery Row is the city of Pacific Grove. Its recent history stems from the days when it was a Methodist camp-meeting ground, complete with a fence, and duly locked against the sinful world at curfew. Today it has become rather nondescript middle-class-a haven for retired Middlewesterners of the staider sorts and a respectable resi- dential town. Its moralistic past lingers on in covenants in real estate deeds forever prohibiting the sale of liquor, and in books in the public library from which the profanity has been scratched with a righteous nail file (apparently; maybe it was a hat pin or a corset stay). Public night life in Pacific Grove is limited to a few dreary milkshake dens and occasional prowling teenagers trying to make noises like juvenile delinquents. Across the wooded ridge of the Peninsula is Carmel-by-the-Sea. Originally an artists-and-writers colony, Carmel has become a fashionable center for all sorts of people with cultural pretensions and a surplus of money. It is quaint and arty and individualistic and grimly "unspoiled." Down the coast from Carmel is the craggy and desolate Big Sur country (once Robinson Jeffers' special literary domain). Most of the shore line between Pacific Grove and Carmel, and most of the wooded hills behind it, are part of the Del Monte Properties-an exclusive real estate develop- ment purveying summer homes and de luxe lodge accommodations to the financial aristocracy of California. The Monterey Peninsula has a lively bohemian-artist-writer class. The ones with money live in Carmel. The others in the hills above Mon- terey, in the Big Sur country, or anywhere else where rents are low and the folkways relaxed. The mild climate makes a minimum of clothes and housing quite tolerable. The shifting population, the resort atmos- phere, and the lack of strenuous industry all give a certain glamor and acceptability to the bohemian life. It even has a certain economic import- ance as part of the tourist bait. One other environmental feature should be mentioned: the Bay swarms with marine life. Even a casual observer of the tide pools gets some of the feeling for biological diversity, fecundity, and struggle which has played so important a part in Steinbeck's thinking. 347</page><page sequence="4">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW II John Steinbeck grew up in Salinas and after four years at Stanford University he lived at various times in Carmel and Pacific Grove and kept a fishing boat in Monterey Harbor. More perhaps than any important contemporary American writer, except William Faulkner, his writing has grown out of a special region. It is a region, however, that contains such polar extremes as the hard materialism of Salinas and the bohemian- ism of the Peninsula. Both have obviously been important in Steinbeck's writing but Salinas came first and is most apparent. The cultural climate of the Salinas Valley is typical of California agriculture. A tradition of personal individualism goes along with a strongly collectivized economy. As Carey McWilliams has pointed out, the great California valleys show few resemblances to traditional Amer- ican rural life. The "school-house on the hilltop, the comfortable homes, the compact and easy indolence of the countryside" are noticeably absent. Instead there are the vast orchards, vineyards, and ranches, meticulously tended, irrigated, and smudged but showing little close functional con- nection with human life. They are (most of them) really farm factories, and their financing and cultivation, and the marketing of their output, have become highly collectivized activities, managed by and for the great owners and packers, the banks, and the utilities. As in most big business, ownership and management are usually sharply separated. The exploita- tion of labor has exceeded anything known in Western civilization since the early mill towns of England. The operators of this paradise have usually been able to use or usurp the sovereign powers of local or state government whenever necessary to wipe out a threat to their absolutism. Economically, socially, and culturally it has been an ugly state of affairs. In its extremes of wealth and destitution, in the absence or im- potence of any middle group representing the public interest, and in the domination of the organs of civil life by irresponsible private greed, it has been one of the few areas of American life that has closely approxi- mated the Marxian predictions about capitalist society. The proletariat was kept homeless, voteless, and close to or below the starvation point, with the gulf between it and the dominant group widened by racial dif- ferences. Civil liberties were nonexistent whenever they remotely threat- ened the status quo. The whole system was impersonal and relentless and 348</page><page sequence="5">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN individual men of good will on either side were helpless to do much about it. There was no liberal, middle-of-the-road answer that had much reality to it. It is not surprising that Steinbeck's reaction to this aspect of his environment was to explore communist answers in In Dubious Battle. The book is the story of two communists and the strike they organ- ize(l and directed in the apple country. It is a very "dubious battle" indeed. They don't expect to win the strike-in fact they prefer it that way. Their job is to give the strikers an experience of working together and a feeling of their united strength, and to convince them of the implacable nature of their enemy by a bath of blood that will turn as many of them as pos- sible into all-out revolutionaries. All available tricks and deceits are thrown into the game and friends and sympathizers are sacrificed ruth- lessly. (Tlhe forces of "law and order," to be sure, play their hand as (lirtily as they can and leave little to be done in the way of creating grievances and incidents.) One of the communists is killed as the strike beg,ins to dlisintegrate and the book ends with his faceless corpse propped up on the platform to help his comrade stir up the men to a final burst of violence. It is a study of tactics that make sense only for the long-term end of bloody revolution. Chiaracteristically, however, Steinbeck's interest in the communists hias always been more a matter of what makes them tick as people than of abstract ideology. Why should they go out to face certain beating and possible death- from the enemy and betrayal and hatred from the people they are trying to organize? It is this question of motivation that runs through In Dubious Battle, is singled out in the story, "The Raid" in The Long Valley, and echoes in Casey in The Grapes of Wrath. As near as Steinbeck comes to an answer is Casey's quoting of the "fella in the jail house": You didn't do it for fun no way. Doin' it 'cause you have to. 'Cause it's you.... Anyways you do what you can ... the on'y thing you got to look at is that ever' time they's a little step fo'ward, she may slip back a little, but she never slips clear back. You can prove that, an' that makes the whole thing right. An' that means they wasn't no waste even if it seemed like they was. But there is also the note of doubt, of conflict between faith and skep- ticism. The doctor of In Dubious Battle, who will give everything he's got to help the strikers but who has no real faith in the cause, is one side of the conflict in Steinbeck himself. Interestingly enough, Steinbeck never 349</page><page sequence="6">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW seems to question the adequacy of the Marxian analysis-he accepts class war and inevitable revolution as the way things are and will be. His doubts go deeper, really; they are doubts as to the nature of mankind itself. The first party for "Doc" in Cannery Row is a symbolic dramatization of a feeling that runs all through Steinbeck's writing. Mack and the boys give a surprise party for Doc to show him how much they like him. But Doc doesn't get home when they think he will and the party "she got out of hand." Doc finally gets back to his devastated laboratory and Mack tells him: It don't do no good to say I'm sorry. I been sorry all my life. This ain't no new thing. It's always like this. . . . I had a wife. Same thing. Ever' thing I done turned sour.... If I done a good thing it got poisoned up some way. If I give her a present they was something wrong with it. She only got hurt from me. There are many variations of this "every man kills the thing he loves" theme in Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men is little else. The doctor of In Dubious Battle says: There aren't any beginnings. Nor any ends. It seems to me that man has engaged in a blind and fearful struggle out of a past he can't remember, into a future he can't foresee nor understand. And man has met and defeated every obstacle, every enemy except one. He cannot win over himself. How mankind hates itself.... We fight ourselves and we can only win by killing every man. I would suggest that both Steinbeck's acceptance of Marxian dogma as accurate prophecy and his distrust of humanity are outcomes of his California background, and that a broader perspective on American life offers evidence of another sort. The historical analysis of Marxism calls for a steady intensification of class warfare, in which the lines are drawn more and more sharply, compromise and gradualism become less and less possible, until the stand- up-and-slug-it-out day of revolution comes. After which all things will be different. A lot of our most able writers have accepted this prognosis for America at one time or another. Often, perhaps, they have done so because its drive-to-a-showdown jibes so neatly with their own personality unbalance. The mixture of social revolt, idealism, spiritual homelessness, and unresolved tension that has been so characteristic of serious American writing since the first World War demands an explosive crisis to bring itself to a tolerable, if only temporary, equilibrium. But it has been an out- 350</page><page sequence="7">JOHN STEIN-BECK, CALIFORNIAN standing quality of American evolution since the Civil War that the march of events has by-passed every crisis and that the great showdown never comes. Time and again things have built up to the boiling point, only to subside as new developments broke up rigidities and diverted energies. The revolutionary effects of mass production and technology, and the tremendous reshuffling caused by two world wars seem to have been the factors most responsible. This by-passing of crises has not been so characteristic of California history as of the country as a whole but I think it can be shown that it has happened there as well-and in one of the worst crisis-spots. When The Grapes of Wrath and Factories in the Field appeared it looked as if nothing could avert an all-out battle between revolution and fascism in California's great valleys. Conditions were intolerable, tensions were in- candescent, and both sides seemed ready and eager to fight it out. But the war raised food prices, created a labor shortage, and brought badly- needed industrial ballast to the California economy. The situation may, of course, come to a new boiling point in the future. But the larger picture has changed and goes on changing and there is no showdown. This blind dynamic of American growth-this refusal to harden into a static shape-is one of the great and hopeful things about this country. It doesn't make things easier for the writers, however, and may be one reason for the short creative life-expectancy of the best of them. III American civilization, with its extraordinary melting pot and its many regional variations, is a risky thing to generalize about. But there is certainly a central core of character, custom, and belief that has been the dominant national strain. Americans, by and large, tend to be optimistic, pragmatic, outgoing, gregarious, energetic, and moral. We believe in the home, in education and self-betterment, in religion and moral responsi- bility; we take eagerly to the new in technics and distrust the new in social and political institutions; we rate character above intelligence and horse sense above theory. Wherever we have lived for several generations without too much upheaval, these characteristics have become part of a way of life, or a social tradition, or whatever you care to call it, which has a life and strength of its own and shapes the individuals who grow up in it. In spite of variations and breakdowns, this condition of settled 35I</page><page sequence="8">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW society has, for better or worse, made us what we are. It is what we have to start with and to go on from. American society, in this sense, is probably strongest in the Middle West. It is noticeably weaker in the Far West and especially weak in Steinbeck's country. There are obvious reasons for this: it is only a hun- dred years since California was largely unmapped, undeveloped, and very thinly inhabited. It is still subject to upheaval by a great wave of immigrants every twenty years or so and a steady inflow between waves. In the years when it was absorbing the first great comings of Americans, the rigors of the journey, the isolation of the section from the country back East, and the strangeness of the life and the countryside all tended to dilute and efface the habits and culture that the immigrants brought with them. For the most part, the existence of a settled and mature society is exceptional and the typical state of affairs is a condition of formless flux or of unbalanced extremes. Furthermore, this condition isn't merely a matter of a time lag. The settled American society that we talk about is itself in process of change -so abrupt a series of changes that we can almost say that it is breaking up around our ears. It has lost much of its relevance to the conditions of modern life and it is by no means certain that it will be adaptable enough to make a transition of any smoothness to meet new needs. Since the Far West experienced this pattern of social integration only partially when it was in its prime in the East, now that it is falling apart we can hardly expect to see much more growth of it. Most of the country's intellectuals -which includes the writers-have been cheering on this social breakup for the last twenty-five years. They have carried on a running battle against the restrictions and compulsions of settled society, usually in the name of individual freedom. One of the major differences between the East and the West is that in the East this anti-society drive has about run its course, while in the West it seems to be just getting under way. The intellectuals of the East have learned that freedom is more com- plicated than getting away from family and neighbors, or from "the system." The "freedom from" battle has become a rout and such questions as "freedom for what?" and "How do we escape this freedom that we cannot handle ?" are the order of the day. It is being discovered-the hard 352</page><page sequence="9">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN way-that a settled society offers securities and supports without which few individuals can remain integrated. The Far West, however, is kicking up its heels in an individualistic binge very much like the bohemianism of Greenwich Village of the '20's. The little magazines are feeling their cultural oats in what would look like a real renaissance if we hadn't seen the same thing and its aftermath in the East. In Steinbeck's home country, there are more than a few devotees of what a recent Harper's article calls "The New Cult of Sex and Anarchism.' Steinbeck has always had a keen awareness of the importance of the social cement of common purpose as far as small groups are concerned. That he has never extended it to society as a whole is probably because there has been little visible reason in California life for considering such a projection anything but fanciful. And the Marxist slant on things, of course, has its poetic summation in Dos Passos' "All right we are two nations." As Mac puts it in In Dubious Battle: Men always like to work together. There's a hunger in men to work together. Do you know that ten men can lift nearly twelve times as big a load as one can? It only takes a little spark to get them going. Most of the time they're suspicious, because every time someone gets 'em working in a group the profit of their work is taken away from them; but wait till they get work- ing for themselves. Lord knows we have come close enough to being two nations often enough (or three, or four, or no nation at all). But always the change and the reshuffling have gone on and when the chips were down we have been one nation. On the other hand, most parts of California have never been places to get any such feeling and if we don't find it in Steinbeck there's no reason we should expect to. Steinbeck's California contains little fragments of the American character, detached from the whole and dragged over the mountains and the desert with the other immigrant baggage and overdeveloped by the golden sun and the ache of home- sickness. The big shots and vigilantes of Salinas show one sort of over- developed fragmentation; the fierce Christers of Pacific Grove another. Most of the distribution curves between the mountains and the sea are violently skewed. Which brings us to another one of Steinbeck's favorite black and white oversimplifications; as he puts it in Sea of Cortez: 353</page><page sequence="10">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW the so-called and considered good qualities are invariably concomitants of failure, while the bad ones are the cornerstones of success. The same idea is somewhat better expressed by Doc in Cannery Row: The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. The duplication shows how fond Steinbeck is of this idea. It may be a reasonable reaction to the Salinas growers and their flunkies, but as an unqualified statement about American life it is absurd. It probably had considerable truth in it in the "Robber Baron" period after the Civil War, when the relatively simple and self-sufficient village economies of agri- culture, handcraft and trade were disappearing before the thrust of big business combinations. There were huge rewards then in financial piracy and mercantile buccaneering. But the very process that has changed the typical American career from individual enterprise to wage- or salary- earning for one bureaucracy or another has brought about a lessening of acquisitive pressures. It is still true enough that a man who puts money- getting at the top of his agenda will usually accumulate more of it than a man who doesn't. But unless it is "failure" not to be a millionaire, there are plenty of-fields of activity in which the generous virtues are no handi- cap. In fact, one of the most characteristic "types" in modern life is the go-getter who never quite makes the grade, is always busily outfoxing himself, and affords endless amusement to his more relaxed colleagues. This key idea of Steinbeck's is, I submit, a California aberration. That it is a key idea is pretty obvious. It crops out in the way he hates his middle-class characters. (There are no capitalist giants in Steinbeck's writing-except for occasional beautifully scatological references to Hearst.) His middle-class men are mean, pudgy creatures, blinking pinkly through spectacles, the slaves of their small anxieties and their neurotic and sexually frigid wives. The lunch-wagon woman in The Grapes of Wrath dismisses them collectively as "shitheels." (It should be remembered too that California is perpetually full of tourists, and that to the gawked-at native the American Tourist is not a sympathetic type.) This hatred of the genteel, the solvent, and the fancypants is, of course, the other side of the sentimentalizing of the paisanos of Tortilla Flat and the bums of Cannery Row. Which is one of the things Steinbeck 354</page><page sequence="11">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN is famous for. It doesn't require too complicated an explanation. Every- thing Steinbeck has written shows the urgency of his need to "bite deeply into living." His environment, however, showed him only a mean, life- denying greed and respectability firmly in the saddle. He tried for a while to find answers and a spiritual home for himself in the dream of social rev- olution. But the Revolution has its own austerities and narrow righteous- ness and there was always his deep distrust of humanity's capacity for surpassing itself. But when he had rejected Man as Success and Man as Citizen, and couldn't quite accept Man as Reformer or Revolutionary, what was left? Well, there was Man as Animal, and to be satisfactory he had to be without any other pretensions. Hence Danny and Pilon and Mack and the boys. It is noticeable, however, that even Steinbeck cannot sustain the celebration of Man as Animal for long without slipping into a semi-lyrical sort of fantasy-prose in which the complexities and conse- quences of real life are lost in the happy fog of a literary mood. It is un- deniable that an important section of the traditional American character got itself badly warped by trying to ignore Man as Animal. Writers of our generation have supplied a corrective reaction which was certainly needed but has just as certainly been a little more than adequate. There is one of Steinbeck's books, however, in which his tensions and conflicts seem to have reached an affirmative equilibrium. The people in The Grapes of Wrath are whole (Man as Man, for a change); they live with the natural balance of biological, social, and spiritual needs and assertions that makes the human being. There is no anxiety over leftist means and ends, no agonizing about the self-hate in man. For all its sprawling asides and extravagances, The Grapes of Wrath is a big book, a great book, and one of maybe two or three American novels in a class with Huckleberry Finn. I think it is significant that The Grapes of Wrath is about folks who have the cement of settled society in them. For all their exile and desti- tution, they are a people, and they act as a people to an extent that is unique in Steinbeck's writing and in the California life which he knows best. I suggest that it is this social integration-which Steinbeck has felt and reproduced amazingly well-which is the greatness of this book. Further, this social integration provides the answers to the dichotomies and oversimplifications which torture so much of Steinbeck's other writ- 355</page><page sequence="12">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW ing. Against it as a frame of reference, being a responsible citizen and a jobholder becomes merely playing an honest and dignified part in the common life-rather than the mean abdication of freedom and vitality that is implied by the glorification of Mack and the boys. The tortured obsession about men killing the thing they love shows up as the self- pitying indulgence of a romantic individualism gone sour. The answer to it is in Ma Joad's advice to Uncle John about his sins: Tell 'em to God. Don' go burdenin' other people with your sins. That ain't decent.... Go down the river an' stick your head under an' whisper 'em in the stream. The pattern of life that Steinbeck found in the Joads-their strength as a people-has been undergoing the attrition of the city and the machine for several generations. Much of it is gone for good and much that remains is moribund. No amount of nostalgic yearning is going to regenerate it. But the lesson we are painfully learning today is that some sort of settled society-with habits, folkways, common aspirations, sanc- tions and taboos-is an essential part of human life. The rampant indi- vidualism of the frontier days is not only too irresponsibly anarchic for modern economic society but it fails to provide the social fabric that sup- ports individual sanity. A kind of dynamic balance between society and the individual is what we need and the danger of too much individualism is that it can create a reaction to the other extreme. It should go without saying that the social integration we need will have to be relevant to today's conditions of living. But that is a long way from saying (as so much of our literature has said for the last twenty-five years) that all society, or all "capitalist" society, is rotten to the core and must be swept into the ashcan of history before things can be better. IV There is a coldness about The Wayward Bus that reviewers have variously found unpleasant and a welcome change from previous emo- tional lushness. The book has few "sympathetic" characters and these are chiefly distinguished by a sort of hard, despairing honesty. One of the best reviews that have appeared' points out that the key to Steinbeck's approach in this book is explicitly stated in Sea of Cortez. 'By Toni Jackson Ricketts in What's Doing On The Monterey Peninsula, a small California magazine which began as tourist bait and has matured in a little over a year into a first-rate regional publication. Mrs. Ricketts knows Steinbeck well and her statements about his intent can be accepted as sound. 356</page><page sequence="13">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN In a rough way, Sea of Cortez occupies about the same place in Stein- beck's work that Death in the Afternoon does in Hemingway's. Both are relaxed musings about life and art, written as breathers between novels. There is also something of a parallel in Hemingway tying Death in the Afternoon to the lore of the bull ring while Steinbeck uses a cruise to the Gulf of California-to collect tide-pool invertebrates-as his framework. The ritual violence of bull-fighting was Hemingway's peacetime labora- tory for the study of death and pure emotion. Marine biology has had a similar fascination for Steinbeck. The part of Sea of Cortez that concerns us here is Steinbeck's specu- lation about what he calls "nonteleogical thinking." This seems to be a mixture of philosophical relativism, the rigorous refusal of the scientist to be dogmatic about hypotheses, and a sort of moral fatalism. To quote: What we personally conceive by the term "teleological thinking" . . . is most frequently associated with the evaluation of causes and effects, the purposive- ness of events. This kind of thinking considers changes and cures-what "should be" in the terms of an end pattern (which is often a subjective or an anthropomorphic projection); it presumes the bettering of conditions, often, unfortunately, without achieving more than a most superficial understanding of those conditions. In their sometimes intolerant refusal to face facts as they are, teleological notions may substitute a fierce but ineffectual attempt to change conditions which are assumed to be undesirable, in place of the under- standing-acceptance which would pave the way for a more sensible attempt at any change which may still be indicated. Nonteleological ideas derive through "is" thinking, associated with natural selection as Darwin seems to have understood it. They imply depth, funda- mentalism, and clarity-seeing beyond traditional or personal projection. They consider events as outgrowths and expressions rather than as results; conscious acceptance as a desideratum, and certainly as an all-important prerequisite. Nonteleological thinking concerns itself primarily not with what should be, or could be, or might be, but rather with what actually "is"-attempting at most to answer the already sufficiently difficult questions what or how, instead of why. This is fairly heavy going but it is clear enough that Steinbeck is objecting to wishfulness obscuring facts, and understanding being limited by preconceived notions of what should be the case. No one can quarrel with this. There is a strong implication, however, that to think in terms of "why" and "what might be" is not only risky but downright sinful. This implication is even stronger in the following: 357</page><page sequence="14">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW It is amazing how the strictures of the old teleologies infect our observation, causal thinking warped by hope. It was said earlier that hope is a diagnostic human trait, and this simple cortex symptom seems to be a prime factor in our inspection of our universe. For hope implies a change from a present bad condition to a future better one. The slave hopes for freedom, the weary man for rest, the hungry for food. And the feeders of hope, economic and religious, have from these simple strivings of dissatisfaction managed to create a world picture which is very hard to escape. Man grows toward perfection; animals grow toward man; bad grows toward good; and down toward up, until our little mechanism, hope, achieved in ourselves probably to cushion the shock of thought, manages to warp our whole world. . . . To most men the most hateful statement possible is, "A thing is because it is." Even those who have managed to drop the leading-strings of a Sunday-school deity are still led by the unconscious teleology of their developed trick. It should be apparent from these quotations why I said that Stein- beck's "is-thinking" has a large content of moral fatalism. If the height of wisdom is "things are because they are" and thinking in terms of cause and effect and of changes for the better are Sunday-school fatuities, we come to an attitude towards life remarkably oriental and passive. It is not the attitude with which we normally contemplate our house catching fire-nor our world catching fire. For that matter, it is not an attitude which would lead anyone to build a house in the first place-or to do any other creative job based on "what might be." Nor will observation which shuns the "why" of things see very much in the long run. Its only logical end is pure mysticism-a search for objectivity winding up in the absolute subjective. This line of thought is not new in Steinbeck's writing. The doctor of In Dubious Battle is something of a nonteleological thinker. But previously it had been a sort of intriguing sideline. In Sea of Cortez it becomes the main channel and in both Cannery Row and The Wayward Bus Stein- beck is obviously trying to see what he can do with nonteleological litera- ture. I can only speculate as to why his slant on things took this particular turn at this particular time. But the Sea of Cortez cruise took place in the spring and early summer of 1940, when the Nazis were overrunning France and the Low Countries. Steinbeck's attitude to the war then was that it was: a war . . . which no one wants to fight, in which no one can see a gain-a zombie war of sleep-walkers which nevertheless goes on out of all control of intelligence. 358</page><page sequence="15">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN So he collected his invertebrates and watched the teeming tide-pool struggle of eat-and-be-eaten and wondered whether a school of fish mightn't properly be considered an organism in its own right (like "group-man"), and he thought further about war and men: When it seems that men may be kinder to men, that wars may not come again, we completely ignore the nature of our species. If we used the same smug observation on ourselves that we do on hermit crabs we would be forced to say, with the information at hand, "It is one diagnostic trait of Homo Sapiens that groups of individuals are periodically infected with a feverish nervousness which causes the individual to turn on and destroy, not only his own kind, but the works of his own kind. It is not known whether this be caused by a virus, some airborne spore, or whether it be a species reaction to some meteorological stimulus as yet undetermined." Hope, which is another species diagnostic trait-the hope that this may not always be-does not in the least change the observable past and present. When two crayfish meet, they usually fight. One would say that perhaps they might not at a future time, but without some mutation it is not likely that they will lose this trait. And perhaps our species is not likely to forgo war without some psychic mutation which at present, at least, does not seem imminent. And if one places the blame for killing and destroying on economic insecurity, on inequality, on injustice, he is simply stating the proposition in another way. We have what we are.... So far the murder trait of our species is as regular and observable as our various sexual habits. It seems likely that the war was, for Steinbeck, overwhelming evi- dence of the irrational, self-destructive drive of the human race; that it killed-or at least submerged-the faith and buoyancy that filled The Grapes of Wrath; and that it drove him back on the toughminded nihilism of "is-thinking." As noted above, the "golden mean" and the "middle way" are no part of Steinbeck's temperament. When he abandons Man as Man for Man as Biological Freak he goes all the way. He jettisons not only hope and progress but cause and effect as well. Which leaves the vertebrates of The Wayward Bus, animated by the simpler forms of pro- toplasmic irritability, and deprived of even a biological dignity by their silly pretensions that they are up to something noble. Steinibeck's current "is-thinking" has a lot in common with the search for verbal simplicity and for the hard, clean reality of the physically tangible that characterized Hemingway's writing after the previous war. Both are spiritually weary, sick of abstractions and ideologies, and both findl comfort in the evocation of what can be seen, felt, heard, smelled, 359</page><page sequence="16">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW and tasted. In Steinbeck, this retreat to physical reality takes the form of descriptions of the countryside and its wild life and a meticulous reporting of physical action-especially skilled action. In The Wayward Bus some of his reporting is a repetition of what he has done better elsewhere. The repairs to the bus that open the book are of a piece with the burnt-out connecting rod bearing in The Grapes of Wrath (including the same superstition about skinned knuckles). The Chicoy lunchroom also has a prototype in the previous book and Mrs. Pritchard had a preview in the story called "The White Quail." But much of the book is fresh and new and if Steinbeck's faith in mankind is at a low ebb, his skill as a writer is becoming keener. There is more precision and control in the prose and the structure than in his other books and it ends with little of the melo- drama that has wound up most of his previous novels. The Wayward Bus is, if less intensely regional than some of his other books, the most broadly descriptive of California's countryside and the queer assortments of people encountered there. The accidental grouping of a collection of "characters" in a situation which "brings them out" is more than a novelist's trick. It is itself fairly typical of California life. It symbolizes the endless coming and going, the fragmentary social integra- tion, and the human diversity of the region. In fact, it would be quite plausible to say that Steinbeck's "is-thinking" can be explained without reference to any background of disillusionment in revolution and man- kind-that it is simply the way life looks to a thoughtful Californian who has outgrown his youth. V In many ways the American West might be a good place in which to see our future cultural pattern shape up. The lack of settled society which we dwelt on above may facilitate new cultural fusions and social forms. Just as America itself diverged widely from its European sources because it encountered the first impact of the industrial revolution with less of a cushioning of habit and institutional inertia than the old country, so the West may adapt to the continuing thrust of change more directly and flexibly than the more static East. There are many rigid extremes in the West, of course, and California in particular has many people who come out only to die, or to postpone dying. But the general configuration is one of flux and change and it is a region to which many come in the 360</page><page sequence="17">JOHN STEINBECK, CALIFORNIAN hope of some sort of vaguely splendid fulfillment. There is still something of the selective process which colonized and settled America at work and California is a setting in which an inchoate mass of aspiration and restless hope will have to either find new patterns of living or drown itself in the Pacific. One important area where the West seems to show a hopeful flexi- bility is in the relation between the intellectual and the common man. In most of the country the cleavages between these two classes is one of the sharpest and most disastrous gulfs in American life. The intellectual is a specialist in abstract thought. He typically works from the general to the particular (and sometimes never arrives at the particular at all) and is articulate to a point where he is often unable to perceive any reality for which he lacks a word. The nonintellectual, on the other hand, deals with particulars almost exclusively. He ordinarily uses abstractions and generalizations only in an uncritical, proverbial way that he has picked up from someone else. For the most part, he is incapable of abstract think- ing-being unable to use words precisely or to perceive the niceties of logic. But the intellectual so overvalues words and logic, and generalizes from such a narrow base of experience that his conclusions are often irrelevant and sometimes absurd. More serious, he is usually cut off by his overspecialized work and personality from any broad, functional give- and-take with society as a whole. Consequently, his shortcomings of understanding tend to be self-reinforcing and he becomes more and more isolated culturally from everyone but other intellectuals. Society, mean- while, is deprived of effective intellectual leadership from its most talented (in this direction) members and becomes ripe for totalitarian manipula- tion. This vicious circle is of special importance to writers because they are, in the nature of things, intellectuals, and their job is to give meaning and relationship to the raw stuff of life. And since most readers, critics, and publishers of serious literature are also intellectuals, and since a suc- cessful writer usually moves completely out of his social and cultural origins into the rarefied air of the literary world, the unhappy social arid individual effects of intellectual isolationism are all too characteristic of contemporary literature. All of this has to do with Steinbeck because-almost alone among important contemporaries-he seems to have no hankering for the literary 36I</page><page sequence="18">THE ANTIOCH REVIEW life or the isolationism of a typical intellectual. The people he writes about are primarily nonintellectuals and his acquaintance with such people and his intuitive feeling for what makes them tick are probably his greatest strength as a writer. He presumably classifies the typical professional in- tellectual along with the other middle-class "shitheels" as inferior and inadequate human beings. His best field is the subrational and the in- articulate and many of the reviews of The Wayward Bus show that this anti-intellectualism produces confusion among the critics who are called upon to classify and evaluate his writing. The brilliant Mr. Barzun, for instance, discussed the book in a recent issue of Harper's with a mixture of disdain and incomprehension. The characters of The Wayward Bus meet no vital counterparts in Mr. Bar- zun's frame of reference-exceptionally qualified though he is in the worlds of learning and abstractions-and he could only blather about Steinbeck's using the naturalist tradition without bothering to understand it. On the other hand, there have been some reviews of the book which overpraised it with the maudlin hysteria of someone's maiden aunt trying to live dangerously. It is typical of Steinbeck-and it is typical of California-that he can study biology and speculate about teleology without losing his interest in, or fellowship with, Mack and the boys. His biggest contribution as a writer may turn out to have been the exploration and colonization of the no-man's-land between intellectual and nonintellectual, rational and sub- rational. Similarly, the ferment of California may come to play a similar part in the future of America. As we have suggested above, Steinbeck's Sea of Cortez musings sug- gest that he has grown weary of trying to make responsible sense of life and is experimenting with "nonteleological" reporting. But even the most arid stretches of The Wayward Bus pretty well demonstrate the impos- sibility of writing in a state of abstract omniscience from which cause and effect and good and bad have been filtered. Even among the dip-net heterogeneity of this novel's catch, he obviously likes some and dislikes others, and he finds it necessary to explain how they got the way they are. Both Steinbeck and California are relatively young. I suggest that both may have their most creative days ahead of them. And that it would be intelligent to study them in relation to each other. 362</page></plain_text>
