<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 10. No. 2, June 1996 NO 'ELSEWHERE': FISH, SOLOVEITCHIK, AND THE UN AVOID ABILITY OF INTERPRETATION William Kolbrener Abstract Contemporary pragmatists often distinguish between epistemologies: those com mitted to interpretation, and those rooted in metaphysics. But if Richard Rorty, assuming such a distinction, argues for the advantages of a liberal hermeneutics committed to contingency, then Stanley Fish has argued that even liberalism presupposes its own metaphysical assumptions. Fish's skepticism towards liberal universalism and his concomitant emphasis on local interpretations, this essay argues, echoes an earlier Rabbinic skepticism and praxis. But where even the radical skeptic Fish re-instates the Enlightenment opposition between pragmatics and theology (thereby casting aspersion on theological hermeneutics), the works of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, an expositor of the epistemology of the Talmud, provides a hermeneutics which fully acknowledges the 'risks of interpretation', without, however, abandoning truth. Indeed, in Soloveitchik's halakhic epi stemology, metaphysics collapses into practice, and truth emerges through interpretation. In his introduction to Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, Richard Rorty proclaims that anybody 'who thinks that there are well-grounded theoretical answers ... algorithms for resolving moral dilemmas' is 'still, in his heart, a theologian or a metaphysician'. Against those explicit or merely residual metaphysicians, Rorty posits his own vision of a 'liberal Utopia: one in which ironism in the relevant sense is universal'. Those ironists 'who face up to the contingency of [their] most central beliefs and desires' would be the inhabit ants of Rorty's 'post-metaphysical culture'—a culture, Rorty hopefully adds, which is 'no more impossible than a post-religious one, and equally desirable'.1 If there can be said to be a central argument running through the essays collected in Stanley Fish's There's No Such Thing as Free Speech,2 it is that universalist claims like Rorty's (unrobust as they may be [NST, p. 230]), whether emerging as a consequence of pragmatism, liberalism, or what Fish calls 'anti-foundationalist theory hope' are themselves particularisms, and © Oxford University Press 1996</page><page sequence="2">172 NO 'ELSEWHERE' subject to the same kinds of critique as those discourses and practices against which they constitute themselves. According to Fish, therefore, there is 'nothing curious about liberalism's intolerance', for notwithstanding its self proclaimed universality, it nonetheless, like 'any other ideology', contains its own 'very particular moral agenda', and must 'reject as beyond the pale anything that does not conform to its constitutive principles' (NST, pp. 135, 137; emphasis added). As even the liberal has metaphysical commitments, evidenced in the open 'cruelty' (according to Rorty, the primary sin in the liberal framework) of Rorty's banishment of the 'religious' from his 'liberal Utopia',3 the charge against closet metaphysicians and theologians loses much of its force.4 Indeed, as Fish himself argues, 'foundationalism and pragmat ism ... cannot be the names of alternative modes of being in the world' [NST, p. 198]. There are no consequences of Rorty's pragmatism, because, Fish writes, one will never find oneself in 'the cleared ground of an epistemo logical reform ("now I see face to face")' but, rather one will be 'in the already occupied ground of some other line of work no less special, no less hostage to commitments it can neither claim nor recognize' (NST, p. 211). There is, therefore, according to Fish, no interpretive perspective which transcends its own historical constraints. All interpretations—notwithstanding their universalist pretensions—are local. Just as one cannot reproach someone for being in 'ideology', one cannot reproach someone for being a metaphysi cian: even the liberal has metaphysical commitments. These commitments always constrain and set the limits for interpretation, no matter how avowedly neutral they may claim to be. The charge of'bad faith', Fish seems to argue, itself evidences bad faith through its imphcit assertion of an interpretive perspective not subject to history or bias—what Gadamer refers to in Truth and Method as 'prejudice', the untranscendable constraints of all interpretation. Fish's critique of Rorty (and his exposure of the metaphysical foundations of even the liberal perspective) would seem to open up the way for the legitimation of explicitly theological perspectives. Surprisingly, however, in Fish's work, it does not. For though Fish affirms that all interpretive perspect ives are ultimately informed (whether explicidy acknowledged or not) by metaphysical commitments, there remains a peculiar strategy to the essays of No Such Thing—exemplified in Fish's parenthetical comment from I Corinthians 13.12, 'now I see face to face'. Fish, in pejoratively attributing to his antagonists theological presuppositions, seems to distinguish between the foundational presuppositions of others (Rorty, for example) and his own merely (and correctly) pragmatist presuppositions. Thus Fish continually taunts his critical adversaries: Rorty's minimalist liberal universalism is com pared to a 'Biblical injunction', and advocates of 'interdisciplinarity', for Fish another particularism parading as a universalism, are described as preaching their 'millenarian' 'gospel' (NST, pp. 217, 220, 237).</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 173 Thus, notwithstanding Fish's explicit disavowal of the distinction between foundational and pragmatist practice, the distinction continues to play a role in the rhetorical strategy of No Such Thing—particularly in the essays on critical legal studies. In these essays, Fish is at pains to distinguish between an account of the law in which things are 'always historical and contingent', and one in which 'the law's operations' are 'grounded in a reality (be it God or a brute materiality or universal moral principles) independent of historical processes' (NST, p. 178). Against those who would invoke 'standards and norms' opposing Fish's own apparent interpretive relativism, Fish argues that 'were such standards to exist somewhere—m the mind of God or in the totality of the universe—there would be no one capable of recognizing or responding to them'. 'After all', he continues, none of us lives in the mind of God or in the totality of the universe; rather we all live in specific places demarcated in their configurations and in their possibilities for action (including ethical action) by transient, partial, shifting, and contingent understandings of what is and what should be (NST, p. 39). The opposition between that which is 'transient, partial, shifting, and contin gent' and the transcendent (whether 'brute materiality', 'moral principles', or the paradigm and precedent 'mind of God') assumes its power because, for Fish, elements in the latter category deny the principle of rhetoricity—that interpretation is alone the means by 'which certainties become established' (NST, p. 290). Those who commit themselves to the apparent 'objectivity'— the cleared epistemological ground of the 'face to face'—have transgressed Fish's one universal law: acknowledge thyself rhetorical. For Fish, as Rorty, the epistemology implicit in 'the face to face' fails to acknowledge—in fact masks—its contingent and historical status in its attempts to authorize a universalist perspective. Religious epistemology, for Fish, as for Rorty, con tinues to be the straw-man. Thus, when Fish inveighs against the theological 'face-to-face' (as well as the legal epistemology which derives from it), he seems to be arguing against a whole set of immanentist and universalist assumptions by means of which interpretive strategies can claim objectivity by disclaiming their origin in what Fish calls specific interpretive practices. Donna Haraway, in an argument similar to Fish's, describes this ploy as the 'god-trick', in which a particular 'subject-position' masquerades in the authority of a 'disembodied, all-seeing, hidden eye'.5 Thus, the 'god-trick', as Jean Howard glosses Haraway, is successful by 'silently naturalizing a partial perspective as a universal or total perspective'.6 Here both Howard and Haraway share Fish's agenda: the unmasking of perspectives which claim universalism for what they really are—particular interpretations within particular interpretive traditions. Indeed Haraway's 'god-trick' helps us understand Fish's</page><page sequence="4">174 NO 'ELSEWHERE' theological gibes at Rorty and the advocates of 'interdisciplinarity': theological foundationalisms, according to Fish, entail either transcending 'partial per spectives' so 'that we shall become as gods' (NST, p. 224) or making divine truths—and their necessary and transparent interpretations—appear to be immanent in reality. 'Perception', however, as Fish writes elsewhere, 'is never innocent of assumptions', 'and the assumptions within which it occurs will be responsible for the contours of what is perceived.' 'There can be no category of the "given"', Fish continues, 'if by given one means what is there before interpretation begins'.7 To those who claim self-evident or universal truth, Fish suggests, there is no 'elsewhere' (Coriolanus' claim notwithstanding)—no place outside of interpretation. The hierarchy between theological and pragmatist epistemology in No Such Thing, however, presupposes a theological epistemology which does appeal to the 'given'—which, in Fish's work, is that theological perspective committed to grounding the law in 'perspicuous and immutable abstractions' [NST, p. 179]). This epistemology, Fish implicidy claims, becomes the model for those epistemologies (as well as the hermeneutics which derive from them) which claim universal authority by denying the specificity and histor icity of their own perspectives. Thus Rorty—whose constant invocation of the 'liberal we' belies a belief in 'self-evident' universal truths—has Biblical leanings; while Fish himself is a self-avowed 'localist'. Though Fish's legal essays go farther than any of his critical antagonists in transcending Enlightenment categories (which deny legitimacy to religious epistemology and heremeneutics)—the anti-theological tenor of his own arguments nonetheless betrays his attachment to older categories (where only pragmatists acknowledge the specifically historical mechanisms of interpreta tion). Fish, however, is able to maintain this distinction between pragmatic and theological modes of thought, because, for him, theology—in asserting universality through an appeal to 'immutable abstractions' or to 'the mind of God'—countenances belief in a truth which exists before interpretation. But this dichotomy would not be so resilient in Fish's thought if he recognized epistemologies other than traditional Christian ones. By examining the tradition of Rabbinic Judaism, which culminates, for this study, in the works of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, I hope to demonstrate how Judaism's halakhic or legal epistemology answers to all of Fish's pragmatist criteria for truth claims. Indeed, Soloveitchik's works, Halakhic Man and Halakhic Mind, present a pragmatist defense of theological epistemology which though authored in 1944 anticipates and overgoes Fish's radical scepticism.8 In Soloveitchik's work, unencumbered by both the influences of Christian universalism and the Enlightenment, transcendence is produced locally (through interpretation), while theology is rendered thoroughly pragmatic. Indeed, the legal epistemology which Fish himself advocates (one tied to the</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 175 'shifting, contingent, and the partial') finds an antecedent in Soloveitchik and the source of his halakhic epistemology—the methodology of the rabbis of the Talmud. This epistemology—with its recognition of the historicity and contingency of interpretation—provides a kind of antecedent for not only Fish, but those post-modern theologians who realize with David Tracy that 'the risk of interpretation is thus not only the particular predicament of the theologian', but the 'human predicament as such'.9 Read first through the lens of Soloveitchik's articulation of halakhic epistemology and then the Talmud (in which that epistemology operates), Fish's critique of contemporary universalisms, as well as his countenancing the 'risk of interpretation', can be seen as recapitulating an old story: the pharasaic refusal of Christianity. Fish, from this perspective, becomes a pharisee après la lettre. I. RABBINIC EPISTEMOLOGY And the Eternal Spake unto Moses face to face ... Exodus 33.11 The 'face to face' from I Corinthians, like much in the New Testament, has its Old Testament precedents. On the surface, it may seem that the verse from Exodus provides the very source for Haraway's 'god-trick', and that here, God reveals himself (even if only to Moses) in his ontological fullness. Rashi (R. Solomon Ben Isaac), the eleventh century Biblical exegete, glosses the verse against the grain of this apparent literalism by citing the translation of the verse in the Targum Onkelos (the second century Aramaic translation of the Bible). Rashi himself quotes only Onkelos' translation of the Hebrew word diber, 'spoke', as umtallel, in the reflexive voice—requiring the ungainly English equivalent, 'God spoke himself'. The force of Onkelos' translation here begins to make sense only in the context of his rendering of the key adverbial phrase, 'face to face' [panim el'panim] which he translates as m'lal I'm'lal, or 'words to words'. Where we might have expected the phrase— following Haraway or Fish—to imply a kind of ontological or specular fullness, Rashi, following Onkelos, insists upon the distinctly linguistic nature of the revelation to Moses. Onkelos not only moves away from the possibly disturbing connotations of the anthropomorphism of the verse—the attribution of a 'face' to God— but insists that even the revelation to Moses was one that was mediated through 'words'.10 Following Rashi's explanation through Onkelos, the 'panim el'panim' of the Old Testament is not simply the description of an ontological and metaphysical revelation (the promise of knowing God 'fully'), but a linguistic and legal one. Revelation in Exodus, according to Rashi, is linguistic, sanctioning a tradition in which interpretation never leaves the contingent and historical bounds of language.</page><page sequence="6">i76 NO 'ELSEWHERE' In the more general terms of Emmanuel Levinas, the relationship to the Divine is 'offered up not through a tangible substance, but through absence'. 'God is real and concrete', Levinas continues, 'not through incarnation but through Law.' For Levinas, the metaphysical 'absence' of God opens the world up to language and 'Law', to what he calls, 'Loving the Torah more than God'. From this perspective, the desire for the 'sacred mystery' of God's 'presence' remains unquenchable because its object, the 'substance' of the 'incarnate' God remains forever 'absent'. This is a 'long way', Levinas writes, from the 'warm and almost tangible communion with the Divine',11 which is an ambition implicit not only in certain forms of Christianity but, according to Levinas, in Greek philosophy as well. Where the 'distinguishing feature' of the philosophical enterprise is, as Levinas argues, its equation of truth with an intelligibility of presences ... an intelligibility that considers truth to be what is present or co-present,12 Rabbinic Judaism recognizes no such realm of 'presences', and thus begins with law, not metaphysics—ethics, not ontology. Truth, even of the revealed kind, even to Moses, is as Levinas argues, linguistic, and always subject to— indeed demanding—interpretation. Thus the gemara in tractate Bava Batra (12a) of the Babylonian Talmud affirms: 'A sage [one trained in the law] is better than a prophet.' As Joseph Soloveitchik explains, the 'prophet, the transcendental man par excellence has no right to encroach upon the domain of the sages who decide the law on the basis of their intellect and know ledge'.13 Though prophesy is primary, the subsequent authority of rabbinic interpretation is supreme. Soloveitchik, massively influential in the world of postwar Judaism, has himself attempted to elaborate the epistemological foundations of Jewish law (halakhah) in his two major philosophical works Halakhic Man and Halakhic Mind.14 In this halakhic epistemology—one derived from the languages of the Talmud—truth emerges through the contingent and historical processes of legal analysis: the sages 'decide the law on the basis of their intellect and knowledge'. Where Western philosophy—with its notions of reason and science— often presuppose, in Fish's terms, immutable or perspicuous truths, a properly halakhic epistemology affirms that truth only becomes manifest (often in multiple aspects) through interpretation. To be sure, Soloveitchik's epistemo logy—as that of the gemara from which it derives—preserves the notion of transcendent truth, but it does so by asserting that this truth is tied to contingency, and only emerges through the processes of interpretation. This notion of transcendent truth—which is never accessible through a 'face to face' encounter with the deity—bears little relation to the one posited in</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 177 Haraway's 'god-trick', and by Fish's theological straw-man. The distance of Rabbinic epistemology from these perspectives reveals in particularly striking form what Marshall Grossman has called 'the violence of the hyphen in the term Judeo-Christian'. The explication of Soloveitchik's work which follows precedes in three stages. It begins with Soloveitchik's Halakhic Mind, and his argument that turn-of-the-century revolutions in quantum physics demonstrated the need for interpretive pluralism. It continues by elaborating the ways in which Soloveitchik's emphasis on interpretive pluralism leads to a critique of mysti cism and claims to non-mediated truth. Finally, the argument turns to Soloveitchik's earher work, Halakhic Man, and demonstrates how 'interpretive pluralism' is reflected in the Rabbinic epistemology of the Talmud. This epistemology—despite its ancient pedigree—may meet the requisites of post modem theologians who recognize the unavoidability of interpretation. Indeed, Soloveitchik's work not only legitimates religious experience (as did the work of William James), but religious knowledge—according validity to the perspective of the religious philosopher, alongside that of the humanist and scientist. A. Pluralism Halakhic Man, and especially Halakhic Mind, were bom out of what Soloveitchik calls the 'state of tension' between science and philosophy which led to a questioning of the authority of scientific—especially empirical— paradigms. Thus, if philosophy had traditionally been the 'satellite of science', and modem philosophy from Descartes to scientific positivism and Neo-Kantianism ... nothing but an echo of the mechanistic physics which culminated in the Galilean-Newtonian interpretation of reality (Mind, p. 6), modem physics, and the new fields of 'non-Euclidean geometry, relativity, and quantum mechanics', suddenly made the sciences the unexpected hand maid of philosophy. Far from being able to ignore 'philosophical methods', the modem physicist was suddenly immersed in them. Thus Soloveitchik observed that the affinity between theoretical physics and epistemology is so strong today that ... the demarcation link between these disciplines is almost non-existent.15 The 'physical world picture of today', Soloveitchik continues, 'incomplete without a philosophical frame', establishes the need on the 'part of the empiricist for collaboration with the epistemologist' (Mind, p. 11). The scient</page><page sequence="8">178 NO 'ELSEWHERE' ist, according to Soloveitchik, was suddenly forced to consider the interpretive contexts and frameworks in which scientific knowledge is produced. The modern physicist, confronted with a world 'beyond the range of man's intuitive faculty and sensibility' ('unlike the reality posited by Newtonian physics'), acknowledged the need for a 'philosophical interpreta tion' which would no longer be in thrall to the 'time hallowed myth of the insularity of the objective world' (Mind, p. 25). Where, according to Soloveitchik, even James' pragmatism had, in a limited sense, surrendered to the epistemological monism of the scientist (and the so-called 'objective' world implied in his world view), modern physics, Soloveitchik argues, demonstrated the necessity of an epistemological pluralism which would acknowledge the validity, even the necessity, of a multiplicity of interpretive constructs. For Soloveitchik, as for more recent expositors of the history of science and scientific constructs, the work of Niels Bohr assumed a central role in the critique of the objectivist epistemology implied in classical mechanics. What follows from Bohr's demonstration of 'the reciprocal relation of phe nomenon and experiment' and 'the interference of the latter' with the 'objective occurrence of the former' is, according to Soloveitchik, that the 'entire classic relation of subject-object' must come up for 'reconsideration'. Noting the reciprocal relation between 'phenomenon and experiment' and that subjective constructions and objective data are mutually defining, Soloveitchik concludes that the claim of the 'natural sciences to absolute objectivity must undergo a thorough revision' (Mind, p. 25). Indeed, as the 'passage' from scientific 'constructs to living, concrete phenomenon is tortuous', evidenced most pointedly by the fact that 'the postulated character of physical magnitudes is ... more conspicuous than ever before', the modern physicist was forced to acknowledge the contingency of his interpretive constructs (Mind, p. 11). Since all 'constructs, including the scientific, are but subjective addenda to the pure data' (Mind, p. 21), epistemo logy, writes Soloveitchik, would do well to cast aside such canonized concepts as objectivity and ethical neutrality and survey philosophical doctrines from a subjective, normative view point (Mind, p. 52). If'the logical worth or "reality" of any world formula', Soloveitchik asserts, 'is measured by its "efficiency in doing its work" (Dewey) ... then there can be no reason why aspects alien to science should not be introduced into the cognitive field' (Mind, p. 20). Thus modem physics, rebelling against its Newtonian predecessor, and implicitly acknowledging 'the heterogeneity and pluralistic character of the most basic cognitive methods' (Mind, p. 14),</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 179 opened the way up for interpretive pluralism, and an independent sphere of religious knowledge. In this reading, interpretive method—specifically the interpretive perspective of the theologian—would no longer be held to the so-called objectivist criteria of the scientist. Indeed, the religious thinker, for Soloveitchik, creates his own realm of 'objectification' in a process by which he constructs, or as Soloveitchik puts it, maps reality. Thus, religious objecti fications, no less than their scientific counterparts, provide valid maps of the world. Further, Soloveitchik's interpretive pluralism—with its recognition of a multiplicity of working interpretive frames—necessarily entails an abandon ment of'the old problem of causality' and a turn towards 'description' (Mind, pp. 85-6). Soloveitchik is not himself interested in what he calls the 'why' question, or alternatively 'the genetic approach' to 'the religious act' which both insist upon translating religious phenomena into other—most notably rationalist and causal—registers. The causal or genetic approach (vestiges in the human sciences of the so-called priority of rational or scientific explana tion), denies the truth claims intrinsic to the languages of religion. For when ever 'the causal question is raised', Soloveitchik argues, 'the philosopher must transcend the boundary fine of religion' in order to find an 'answer which lies beyond the religious domain' through 'the existence of an alien factor' (Mind, p. 93). Philosophers of religion—pursuing 'relentlessly' the 'why ques tion'—have traditionally 'blundered', for as soon as they began 'to interpret religious phenomena causally, they negated their very object' by employing a scientific meta-language through which the actual object of their inquiry disappeared (Mind, p. 87). By according interpretive validity to different interpretive vocabularies, Soloveitchik breaks the social scientific monopoly on religious explanation, seeking instead different modes of description. 'The modern philosophy of religion', Soloveitchik writes, 'is not interested in the genetic approach to the religious act, nor does it raise the old problem of causality', rather, its 'focal problem is of a descriptive nature' (Mind, pp. 85—6). In what anticipates a Geertzian turn, Soloveitchik rejects the translation of religion into an 'alien register', and advocates instead what he calls a 'descriptive hermeneutics' which resists causal analysis by implicitly refuting its universalist claims. As there is no meta-discursive realm (the last candidate for such an honor, Science, has taken itself out of the running), Soloveitchik abandons the 'why' question for the 'what' question, and causal analysis for description.16 The turn towards description away from 'genetic methodology' (and the bracketing of the entire question of causation) is decisive for halakhic epistemo logy because it leads to the redefinition of the criteria for truth claims. As in, for example, Kuhn or Lyotard, truth claims are autonomously valid within different discursive contexts, and not susceptible to critique from languages of</page><page sequence="10">i8o NO 'ELSEWHERE' different paradigms. Paradigms, in Kuhn's phrase are incommensurable, while Lyotard's 'différend' testifies to the untranslatability of different languages into a single register. Similarly, for Soloveitchik, the validity of truth claims is not some 'transcendent' source, but rather 'certain concepts and their constitutive experience' (Mind, p. 88). What Soloveitchik calls 'genetics', itself an autonomous discursive universe (and vulnerable, given the insights of modern physics, to its own genetic critique) is irrelevant to practice: 'whatever be the psychological history of geometry', Soloveitchik writes, 'Pythagoras' theorem is autonomously valid' (Mind, p. 88). This pragmatist evaluation of truth claims, in Soloveitchik's work is presupposed upon an indifference to the explanatory claims of genetics, and an attention to dis courses and the objects which they constitute. By demonstrating the way in which modern scientists have themselves dispensed with the criterion of objectivity (and have themselves employed descriptive paradigms), Soloveitchik opens up the way for a multiplicity of different interpretive perspectives. B. Against Rapture Since Soloveitchik's understanding of religious experience begins in the realm of language, like Rashi, he evidences an extreme suspicion of those who claim pre-linguistic or mystical access to truth. Indeed his critique of subjective claims to non-mediated forms of knowledge is adamant: those who follow in the 'footsteps of phenomenological zealots' attempt 'to apprehend the religious experience through a hypersensible act of intuition' and to 'transcend the boundaries of relational scientific knowledge ... to reach into the sphere of super-noesis' (Mind, p. 51). By contrast, the religious philosopher, like the scientist, as opposed to the mystic (identified in Halakhic Man as homo religiosus), finds that "subjective" constructs and paradigms at once produce and are a product of the already constituted object—which are themselves a product of pre-existent traditions of interpretation. The relationship, as Soloveitchik suggests, is one of simultaneity, where subject and object are mutually defining. This neo-Kantian revisionism leads him to the antiroman tic (and perhaps modernist) claim that 'subjectivity cannot be approached directly'. To Soloveitchik, subjectivity is only accessible after it has first been 'objectified by the logos' (Mind, p. 7$). Super-noetic cognition is impossible; knowledge is only produced through language and interpretation. For Soloveitchik, the logos takes, as we saw in Rashi's explanation of the 'face to face', a specifically linguistic form. Thus 'the canonized Scriptures', according to Soloveitchik, 'serve as the most reliable standard of reference for objectivity', and comprise the originary foundational—yet linguistic— act. 'Objectivity', here, is not based upon what Fish calls a 'perspicuous' perception of a non-linguistic truth, but rather the 'Deus dixit' which, accord</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 181 ing to Soloveitchik, reaches its most complete form of 'objectification in the halakhah, or Jewish law. (Mind, p. 81). To Soloveitchik, the halakhah is itself the linguistic grid—'an endless stream of laws, an innumerable amount of halakhot'—which 'constructs a world perspective that embraces the whole vast range of existence' (Man, p. 85). The reality which halakhah posits, however, is by its very nature an effective or pragmatic reality; it does not penetrate, as Aviezer Ravitsky writes, into 'substance and essence',17 nor does it concern itself with ontological questions. That is, though halakhah is the linguistic matrix through which cognition becomes possible, it makes no claim, given the epistemology developed in Halakhic Mind, to absolute— non-mediated—truth. Just as the quantum physicist discovers the 'tortuous' distance between 'construct' and 'reality', so Soloveitchik's 'Halakhic man' recognizes the distance between halakhic constructs and 'reality'. Indeed, the latter term is merely hypothetical and drops out, as it is, at the very best, the unknowable ground for halakhic constructs. Soloveitchik elucidates this bridge between construct and 'reality' (man and an unmediated nature) in a remarkable reading of a Mishnah from Pirke Avot: He who walks by the way and studies and breaks off his study and says, 'How beautiful is this tree, how beautiful is this fallow', Scripture counts it to him as if he committed a mortal sin (cited in Man, p. 85). To this strange injunction that demands attention to linguistic texts before natural phenomena, Soloveitchik writes, 'Cognition should precede rapture'. Soloveitchik further glosses the Mishnaic text: 'He who reaches a peak of enthusiasm prior to his having cognized, prior to his having completed his study, it is as if he has committed a mortal sin' (Man, p. 85). For Soloveitchik, the 'mortal sin' seems nothing more (or less) than an epistemological error—the belief in a non-mediated relation (the possibility of a 'super-noetic' access)—to reality. The experience of mystical 'rapture' involves a betrayal of the understanding that there is no relationship to the physical world outside of linguistic—or halakhic—constructs (or a betrayal, in Fish's terms, of the law of rhetoricity). And indeed, for Soloveitchik this very possibility of'rapture' is postponed indefinitely, for there is no foreseeable end to study: the 'study of the Torah is not a means to another end, but is the end point of all desires', the 'most fundamental principle of all' (Man, p. 87). For Soloveitchik, the on-going processes of study and interpretation preclude the possibility of absorption in a divine reality. Further, for Soloveitchik, halakhic epistemology—with its praxis of study and interpretation—is a constantly creative process. Halakhah, at once a given and addressing man, is also susceptible to continual creation, revision, and</page><page sequence="12">182 NO 'ELSEWHERE' re-interpretation. For Soloveitchik, subject and object are inseparable parts of the same process: 'We do not', Soloveitchik writes, 'find two different components, the subjectively given and the objectively constructed, but one unifed phenomenon' (Mind, p. 66). Thus the halakhah is at once the interpret ive tradition to which the subject necessarily accedes, and an order which is itself continually modified—recreated—through the interpretive acts of the subject. Consequently, Soloveitchik's acknowledgement of the 'Deus dixit' is not—far from it—a prelude to a Biblical literalism or essentialism, but rather to interpretive creativity: 'Halakhic man', is not only a 'simple recipient' of the Torah, but a 'creator of worlds' (Man, p. 81). Given this reciprocal relation between subject and object, tradition and interpretation, the 'power' of what Soloveitchik calls 'creative interpretation' (or chiddush) becomes the 'very foundation of the received tradition'—the means through which halakhah perfects itself through perfecting and acting upon the world (Man, p. 8i). The halakhic man participates in the act of creation, by continually extending the purview of the halakhah, and thus bringing about the constitution of new halakhic constructs, and, as a con sequence new 'worlds'. Soloveitchik's ideal type 'dreams about the complete realization of the Halakhah in the very core of the world, and looks forward to the kingdom of God "contracting" itself and appearing in the midst of concrete reality' (Man, p. 137). The continued dissemination of halakhah— linguistic constructs—is for Soloveitchik the means by which the Torah— and God's provenance—is extended in the world.18 The halakhic mind, as a consequence, is not directed 'on high', to 'the pure, clear existence' of God, but 'to the immediate and phenomenal reality in all its variegated manifestations' (Mind, p. 45; emphasis added). If the 'Torah spoke at length about the creation of the world and related ... the story of the making of heaven and earth', it did so not 'in order to reveal cosmogonie secrets and metaphysical mysteries but rather in order to teach practical Halakhah' (Man, p. 100). 'Halakhic man' does not search for 'the plenitude of a lofty existence' or a 'pure ontic overflow', but rather seeks new contexts— 'the marketplace, the street, the factory, the house, the meeting place' (Mind, p. 92)—for the halakhah's fuller realization. Halakhic epistemology begins, therefore, with contingency, and not some objective pre-linguistic truth, what Fish describes as the unmediated 'face to face'. Indeed, in Soloveitchik's pragmatist rabbinics, interpretation continually re-constitutes truth and reality. That transcendence emerges in this world is most fully exemplified, for Soloveitchik, in the work of the 19th century Lithuanian rabbi, Hayyim of Volozhin. In his Nefesh HaChaim, R. Hayyim declared: 'it is man who gives hfe to and constructs the worlds that are above him', and that the 'whole of transcendental existence is subjected to him and under his sway' (Man, p. 82). Much as it may seem, this is not symptomatic of a romantic or subjectivist</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 183 epistemology (to the contrary, we have already remarked on Soloveitchik's hostility towards 'subjectivism'), but rather a recognition that the transcendent only takes root in the contingent—in the activity of interpretation (halakhic cognition), the continuing act of bringing the law to bear on changing contemporary realities. R. Hayyim's assertion that the transcendent is 'under the sway' of man informs a religious hermeneutics in which the constitution of the law takes at times what seems to be a retroactive form: 'all new, creative insights that a bright student will glean', writes Soloveitchik, 'are an integral part of the oral law' (Man, p. 82). Though, for Soloveitchik, the oral law was transmitted with the written Torah by Moses at Sinai, it is through the creative interpreta tion (the 'chiddush'), that this 'truth' (transcendent or contingent, the distinc tion loses its significance) manifests itself. Halakhic objectivity, therefore, emerges as a process—part of what Fish would call the process of 'keeping the conversation going'. The very methodology of the Talmud illustrate this point: the Talmud does not consist of abstract and formal laws, but rather of varied inquiries into specific cases.19 Only from these contingent cases does the 'chiddush' emerge. Thus halakhic reality, which in Levinas's phrase is always 'anterior' to particular subjective interventions, is nonetheless in a process of continual development as halakhah continues to negotiate new contingencies. This is not then an epistemological perspective which flees from contingency, but one in which contingency itself represents the site of the fuller articulation ( linguistically, through interpretation) of the Law. Rabbi Nissim Ben Gerondi (the Ran) articulated this ideal in the fourteenth century: 'whatever the sages [of the Talmud] would come to agreement upon, that is what God com manded concerning that matter'.20 Indeed, though the sages would never claim to be pursuing any other agenda but what we have come to call 'originalism', the results, as the Ran emphasizes, are that the interpretations of the sages stand in retroactively for the intentions of God. Here, in a striking anticipation of Gadamerian hermeneutics, original intention is under stood as only emerging through traditions of reception and interpretation. This position is echoed in the words of the introduction to Qetzot HaHoshen an early modern halakhic compilation: The Torah was not given to ministering angels. It was given to man with a human mind. He gave us the Torah in conformity to the ability of the human mind to decide, even though it may not be the truth ... only it be according to the conclusions of the human mind ... Let the truth emerge from the earth. The truth be as the sages decide with the human mind.21 Though the Qetzot HaHoshen implicidy introduces a distinction between contingent and absolute truth—between that grasped by the 'human mind'</page><page sequence="14">i84 NO 'ELSEWHERE' and the 'truth'—the text quickly abandons that distinction and affirms that 'the truth be as the sages decide with the human mind'. In the epistemology implicit here, there is no 'monumentally self-declaring language' (NST.', p. 178), but only a truth which 'emerges from the earth'—through the task of interpretation, which has to be done, as Fish asserts, "every time" (NST, p. 199). C. Halakhic Pluralism The words cited from the Qetzot explicidy echo the conclusion of a story related in tractate Bava Metzia (59b), and provide, within a narrative frame work, the basis for Soloveitchik's halakhic epistemology.22 In the gemara here, which relates a dispute between the Sages over the ritual purity of an oven, R. Eliezer cites a number of miraculous occurrences to serve as signs that his is the valid and hence binding legal opinion. His adversaries are not only unmoved by the alteration of nature's course (including the collapse of the classroom in which they were studying), but also the voice from heaven that proclaimed that the halakhah was according to the opinion of R. Eliezer. To R. Eliezer's divine proof, R. Yehoshua protests, 'It is not in heaven'. R. Yermia further explains: since 'the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai, we pay no attention to a heavenly voice'. Objectivism, what Fish calls the 'cleared-epistemological ground of the "face to face'", intimated and then abandoned in the words of the Hoshen Mishpat, is also clearly disavowed in the epilogue to the story in Bava Metzia in which God himself acquiesces to the processes of interpretation: 'My children have defeated me; my children have defeated me.' If the language of the story in Bava Metzia seems to imply a notion of Truth, embodied in the position of R. Eliezer itself sanctioned by God, then the gemara determines that this truth can be rejected because it is simply unconvincing—rhetorically ineffective. Which is not to say that the words of R. Eliezer are not true; indeed, they are, just as the words of his opponents. But, as R. Yirmia continues to explain at the end of the story, the halakhah is determined with reference to the majority. The criterion for determining validity in interpretation will be the rule of the majority—that is, that argument which has the most persuasive efficacy or what Gadamer calls, following Vico, 'the sensus communis'. Further, though the exigencies of the legal process require unambiguous judgments, alternative interpretations are not, however, rejected. As Eliezer Berkovits explains, The minority view is kept in abeyance; it has been overruled conditionally, till such time valid argument would be found for its acceptance. The teaching of the minority is not suppressed; it may retain its theoretical validity.23</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 185 The halakhic process thus runs on two tracks: on one, it responds to practical necessity and renders unambiguous judgments; on the other, it responds to the demands of cognitive autonomy and thus tolerates a variety of different interpretive approaches which might prevail in a future context. This dual approach of halakhah is epitomized by a story from tractate Eruvin (13b): Rabba said in the name of Shmuel: For three years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel debated each other. These said that the halakhah follows their view, and these said that the halakhah follows their view. A heavenly voice went out and declared, these and these are the words of the living God, but the halakhah in practice follows Beit Hillel. Here, the lengthy and undecided dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai eventually elicits the intervention of a heavenly voice which deter mines that both 'these and these are the words of the living God', and, in the remarkable parataxis created by the next clause, that the 'halakhah in practice follows Beit Hillel'.24 Where both the claims of Hillel and Shammai are accorded legitimacy—'as words of the living God'—only one is accorded halakhic legitimacy. Although other recent accounts, focussing on midrash, emphasize the gemara's assertion of multiplicity, what David Stern calls 'Rabbinic polysemy',25 the story is as remarkable for its eventual determina tion of halakhah, as it is for its recognition of the existence of multiple— contradictory—truths. For notwithstanding the multiplicity of halakhic per spectives, the normative halakhah is nonetheless affirmed. Halakha's interpretive pluralism, like the epistemological pluralism of Soloveitchik's works, does not involve an abandonment of truth claims and their validity. Local traditions, in both the explicit epistemology of Halakhic Mind and the less explicit epistemology of the gemara, produce their own truth claims. In the gemara, these contingent and local claims, through the mechanisms of legal interpretation and judgment, become normative for different communities. The source of the norm is not, however, as Fish suggests in his characterization of religious hermeneutics, the unmediated 'face to face', but rather, argument, rhetoric and interpretation. The legal judgements that arise from this process are not true in the Objective sense, but constructs, to paraphrase both Soloveitchik and Fish, which work. II. MODERN PHARISEES Although the epistemology implicit in the passages from the gemara cited above imply the 'pluralism' articulated explicitly by Soloveitchik in his works, this acknowledgement of pluralism does not in itself presuppose the abandon ment of the language of certainty. That is, though there is in the gemara what</page><page sequence="16">186 NO 'ELSEWHERE' I have called a two-track approach—admitting to the requisites of both cognition and din (or judgment), the pluralism admitted in the former sphere does not in any sense limit the absoluteness asserted by the latter. The principle of 'these and these are the words of the living God', though recognizing a multiplicity of truth-claims, does not in itself result in the abandonment of such claims. To be sure, the acknowledgement of the multiplicity of truth has some practical consequences, but these concern modes of behavior, not belief. Indeed, when the gemara asks why Beit Hillel merited to 'fix the halakhah according to their view', it answers because they were easy and forbearing, and they would study their own rulings and those of Beit Shammai, and would even mention the actions of Beit Shammai before their own (Eruvin 13b). Though Beit Hillel evidences a commitment towards dialogue, even what we have come to call dialogism, this is not evidence that they would automatically surrender the validity and authority of their own interpretation. They do, however, show a willingness in Tracy's terms, 'to acknowledge that other world of meaning as ... a possible option'.26 What we might call the acknowledgement of the contingent or rhetorical production of truth, though an implicit assumption in the gemara, does not lead to a rejection of 'truth'—certainly not to, as in Rorty's works, any universalism based upon that assumption. The principle implied in the phrase 'these and these' may lead to what Rorty calls a kind of 'solidarity', but it would be one in which individuals are nonetheless committed to their interpretations of the truth— in their very contingency, particularity, and difference. It is a principle of interpretation which at once accords with postmodernist desires for multipli city and theological devotion to the norm. Where liberal ironism and its relatives in theory and interdisciplinarity seek a new consensus in the acknowledgment of the 'rhetoricity' or 'contingency' of one's 'central beliefs', from within the purview of an halakhic epistemology, such an acknowledgment may lead to good manners (in Levinas' more philosophical terms, the 'recognition of the other'), but not to the abandon ment of the search for truth. Seen in this light, Fish's critique in No Such Thing of those who still abide by the possibility of an 'anti-foundationahst theory hope', recapitulates, in a modem lexicon, a Jewish suspicion of Christian universalist claims. Where various contemporary universalisrns tum towards a perspective which will enact a release from contingency and difference (the conditions of interpretation), Fish remains committed to difference's untranscendability. Disburdened of the theoretical oppositions that are still partly in evidence in his legal writings (which show a residual attachment to those Enlightenment categories which devalue religious epi</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAM KOLBRENER 187 stemology and hermeneutics) Fish begins to line up with the pharisees. Indeed, Fish's own work, with Soloveitchik's as a kind of unacknowledged precedent, might be pressed into the service of the legitimation of different religious knowledges. If, for example, the legal critic James Boyd White idealizes a 'rhetorical vision' which demands a 'commitment to openness' and a 'determination to be poetic', Fish's pharasaic scepticism enacts a rhetoric without a vision (NST, p. 174). It is precisely this scepticism which leads Fish to affirm that White's commitment to rhetoricity betrays its own principles, and that his arguments 'are not rhetorical, but transcendental'. Both White's commitment to 'rhetor ical self-consciousness' and his opposition to "'monotonal thought and speech'" are for Fish evidence of a new universalism in relation to which adherence to contingency—and particular interpretive traditions—becomes a sign of both epistemological and moral failure. That is, in Fish's reading, White's advocacy of 'a many-voiced pluralism' itself becomes a 'monotonal' creed. In this lexicon, 'rhetoricity', like Rorty's 'irony' prescribes a dissolution of contingency in the face of a higher non-discursive truth. The hope for the eventual abandonment of contingency and the emergence of meta discursive truth leads White to 'look forward to a time when all parties', having embraced the truth of the 'rhetorical vision', will lay down their forensic arms and 'join together in the effort to build a new and more rational community' (NST, p. 174). This 'more rational community', like Rorty's 'post-metaphysical' and 'post-religious' culture strangely founds itself on the exclusion of the very concept which informs it: contingency. If White, however, is committed to the 'vision' or spirit of rhetoricity, Fish is committed to a rhetorical practice—interpretation—which never abandons rhetoric for its 'vision'. Where a vision—even of contingency—inevitably becomes 'mon otonal', Fish remains committed to practice. This commitment to practice might provide—despite Fish's explicitly anti-theological tones—a justifica tion of religious knowledge and interpretation against the universalizing tendencies of Rorty and White. For while White 'may begin by acknowledging and celebrating difference', Fish explains, 'in the end, he cannot tolerate it' (NST, p. 174). Similarly, Rorty may start by asserting the 'irreducibility of difference and the concomit ant unavailability of overarching principles', but then 'go on unaccountably', according to Fish, 'to the proclamation of an overarching principle' (NST, p. 218). The 'heterogeneity' of 'contingent' beliefs in these paradigms is merely the vehicle through which the legal theorist and liberal ironist can erase 'contingency' under its own sign. Indeed, for them, the very 'awareness of contingency' will transform its adherents 'into something new' (NST, p. 218): a kind of enclave of 'liberal ironists' who unite together over the dead letter of various outmoded (still metaphysical) particularisms. Those,</page><page sequence="18">l88 NO 'ELSEWHERE' however, who resist this insight and its transformative powers—that is, those committed to their particular contingent beliefs—must themselves be left behind, and as a consequence excluded from the 'liberal Utopia'. For White, Rorty, and the interdisciplinarians, theorists, and empiricists that Fish marshalls in No Such Thing, the 'law of rhetoricity' involves a 'millinerian gospel', a new dispensation which fulfills the promise of 'contingency' through reveal ing the spirit implicit within it. For Fish, however, as for that ancient theological pragmatics articulated in the Talmud, the 'law of rhetoricity' just means business as usual—attention to the letter in all of its contingent, shifting, and local manifestations.

(cited in the text as NST). 3 The extent of Rorty's own particularism remains evident despite his own claims to the contrary. That we ought to try 'to expand our sense of "us", as far as we can'; that we 'should stay on the look out for marginalized people'; and that we should 'try to notice our similarities with them', are indeed noble sentiments. Yet those that would not accede to the ideality of Rorty's 'post-religious age' would necessarily be excluded from Rorty's apparently univer salist, though in fact highly circumscribed, 'us' (Rorty, p. 196). For an evaluation of Rorty's 'us' as part of the 'syntax of hege mony', see Michael Billig, 'Nationalism and Richard Rorty: The Text as a Flag for Pax Americana', New Left Review 202 (1995), 69-83. 4 One might assess Rorty's commitment to the 'avoidance of cruelty' in the same way that T. S. Eliot characterized the commit ments of his former teacher, Bertrand Russell. As Jeffrey Perl, Skepticism and Modem Enmity (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989), writes, in Eliot's 'review "Why Mr Russell is a Christian'", he 'characterized as "pathetic" the philo sopher's faith in his own disinterest, disillu sion, and consequent grasp of reality—and he accused [Russell] of a "wholly unreas oning prejudice in favor of freedom, kindli ness and such things, and the same unreasoning prejudice against tyranny and cruelty'" (pp. 69-70). 5 Donna Haraway, 'Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective', Feminist Studies 14 (1988) 578-80. 6 Jean Howard, 'Towards a postmodem, politically committed, historical practice', in Uses of History: Marxism, Postmodernism, and the Renaissance, eds.

As it turns out, James seems much less reluctant than Fish to employ the distinction between 'transcend ental' and 'pragmatist' metaphysics, the latter of which James describes as inhabiting 'purely abstract heights' (William James, Pragmatism in Focus, ed. Doris Olin [London: Roudedge, 1992], p. 28).

As a consequence, James asserts that 'the pragmatic way of taking religion [is] the deeper way' ( Varieties of Religious Experience [London: Collins, i960], p. 493), and that 'aspirants to a philosophic religion' should 'turn... towards idealistic pantheism' (Pragmatism, p. 49). 9 Cited by Werner G.

Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge: Between Maimonidean and Neo-Kantian Philosophy', Modem Judaism, 6 (1986) 157-88. 15 In 1944, Soloveitchik argued that 'there does not always exist a correspondence between scientific stimulus and philosoph ical response', and that as a consequence, new scientific advances are 'still in need of philosophical formulation'. Soloveitchik thus observes that where 'Newtonian phys ics found its philosophical apostle in Kant; modem physics is still awaiting its philo sophical expounder' (Mind, p. 12). Fifty years on, both Kuhn and Feyarabend seem likely candidates for having fulfilled Soloveitchik's expectations. 16 Clifford Geertz can be seen as combatting the influence of various meta-languages in anthropology, as he dispenses with the con ventional 'genetic' purview of anthropo logy, eschewing explanation for a 'thick description' which 'takes us into the heart of that of which it is an interpretation' ( The Interpretation of Cultures [New York: Basic Books, 1973], p. 17). There is a similar rejection of genetics in Fish's anti-theory argument in No Such Thing: 'Once the con ditions enabling a practice become the object of analytic attention (against the background of still other conditions that are themselves unavailable to conscious inspection), you are engaging in another practice...and the practice you began to examine has been left behind...' (NST, p. 240). 17 Ravitsky, 'Soloveitchik', p. 188. 18 For Soloveitchik the kabbalistic notion tzimtzum or divine contraction, takes a spe cifically legal and linguistic form. Within the 'mystical doctrine', Soloveitchik writes, the idea of tzimtzum 'expresses a meta physical system that penetrates into the hidden recesses of creation', while in the Halakhah, 'the concept of tzimtzum does not pertain to the secrets of creation... but rather to law and judgment' (Man, P- 49) 19 As Adin Steinsaltz observes, 'in the Talmud, as in most areas of original Jewish thought, there is a deliberate evasion of abstract thinking based on abstract con cepts'.
