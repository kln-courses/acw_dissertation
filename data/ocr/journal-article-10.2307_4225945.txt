<plain_text><page sequence="1">J JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXI No. 4 December 1987 Elements of a Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics James A. Swaney A sharper contrast than that provided by a comparison of neoclassi- cal and institutional approaches to the environment is difficult to imagine. The neoclassical approacfi, couched in a mechanical, reduc- tionist worldview where everything is merely the sum of its parts and all values reduce to simple pleasure or pain, is premised on exoge- nous, independent utility functions, private ownership of everything valuable, an "efficient" but static property rights structure, and a system of perfectly competitive markets. The institutional approach, couched in an organic, holistic worldview where few things are merely the sum of their parts (some are more, some are less, and some are incommen- surable) and values are hierarchical and often conflicting, is premised on endogenous, interdependent "preferences" of individuals and groups, socially defined and limited private ownership, a variety of evolving entitlements, and a political economy where political and eco- nomic power mix with market forces in a process that serves both pri- vate interest and social need (although it may do neither well). The organic, holistic worldview of institutionalists is consistent with ecology, which studies the relationship between organisms and their environment, and teaches the interdependence and interconnectedness of living systems. Although ecology began from what economists would call a "micro" approach, analyzing specific species as they interact with their environments, modem ecology also teaches interdependence on a grand scale. Apropos is John Muir's dictum and the Sierra Club 1739</page><page sequence="2">1740 James A. Swaney motto: "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe." Since institutionalists do not accept the premise that values are given and reducible to pleasure or pain, a value criterion or set of criteria must be advanced. In other words, since individual values are shaped in the social process of which the economy is a part, taking individual valuations as a "given" makes little sense, except for convenience or subtle defense of the status quo. Modern institutionalists generally accept Marc Tool's statement of institutional value theory, expressed in the succinct value principle of "the continuity of human life and the noninvidious re-creation of com- munity through the instrumental use of knowledge."' While this prin- ciple is addressed at length in other articles in this and the previous volume, our concern in this article is the obvious human dependence on the natural environment. "Continuity of human life" implies that a balanced diet for malnourished people should come before luxury auto- mobiles; that one human's right to live should come before another's right to bear arms; and that the human community must live within its ecological means. Marc Tool expresses this latter notion as an "ethical corollary" to his social value principle and calls it the "criterion of environmental com- patibility."2 One implication is that both the social and biotic commu- nity must be preserved, because our knowledge is, and probably will continue to be, inadequate to foresee ecological imbalances, lost scien- tific opportunities, and other potential adverse consequences of the ex- tinction of any living species. A threat to any ecosystem is a threat to the human community, because the ecology of every living thing on earth is connected to the ecology of every other living thing on earth, including people. A related implication is the need for conservation of resources. This article focuses on nonhuman resources, with emphasis on other life forms and physical elements useful to humans. These non- human resources include all of those things people usually think of as "natural resources" (oil, minerals, forests, and fisheries, et cetera), and they also include the life support systems of the biosphere. Because hu- man knowledge continues to grow, we cannot know which biological or physical elements will become useful. And because our knowledge of how we fit into the ever-evolving Big System of living systems is so minuscule, we do not know the extent to which human tinkering with the biophysical environment messes up life support systems that we humans have taken for granted. What we do know is that the human animal has recently acquired, at an accelerating pace, the means to alter the environment. We also</page><page sequence="3">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1741 know that the application of this knowledge, which has improved the lives of many, has radically altered portions of the biophysical envi- ronment. While scientific uncertainty over the causes of the seasonal ozone "hole in the sky" over Antarctica remains, the evidence points to a photochemical, probably chlorofluorocarbon, reaction. Scientific uncertainty also persists regarding the consequences of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but the predominant causes are known to be deforestation and combustion, particularly of fossil fuels. When you consider what phenomenal power mankind possesses for manipulating the environment, it certainly should come as no surprise that he is "succeeding" in unforeseen ways. More surprising is the slow- ness with which habits of thinking about the environment change. Only recently have scientists pursued models of interactions between sys- tems, and, although knowledge will advance rapidly, scientific uncer- tainty will persist for decades. The value corollary environmental compatibility dictates that disastrous changes in environmental life support systems be averted, and the criterion of the continuity of hu- man life requires that we not risk severe consequences in the future for luxury lifestyles today. "Innocent until proven guilty" is not only un- justified for production processes and life styles, but is a dangerous and thoughtless approach perpetrated by outmoded habits of thought and defenders of the status quo. We will return to this institutionalist value principle periodically to clarify the principle and pursue the policy implications of concepts introduced. The foundations of a contemporary institutional theory of environ- mental control are found in the turn-of-the-century Progressive conser- vation movement, in the science of ecology, in the writings of Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, and other early institutionalists, and in other works. To avoid duplication and to more fully develop the environ- mental perspective, the general philosophical and theoretical writings of the early institutionalists are not reviewed. We proceed from the con- servation and ecology movements to the basic elements (preconcep- tions, values, and approach to problem solving) of a contemporary neoinstitutionalist theory of environmental control. Specific concep- tual issues and the substantive character of environmental problems are then examined, followed by a conclusion summarizing the article and challenging institutionalists with conceptual and policy problems. The Progressive Conservation Movement and the Ecology Movement While President Theodore Roosevelt and his Forestry Division head Gifford Pinchot are commonly recognized as the leaders of the Progres-</page><page sequence="4">1742 James A. Swaney sive conservation movement, the roots of that movement extend to the early nineteenth century. George Catlin proposed a National Park in 1832, and Alexis de Tocqueville, after a wilderness trip to Michigan in 1831, bemoaned the narrow, shortsighted, and single-minded desire of Americans to subdue nature.3 Henry David Thoreau's statement, "In Wildness is the Preservation of the World," was delivered in an 1851 lecture.4 Although Catlin started the movement that would lead to the world's first national park (Yellowstone, 1872), and Thoreau provided the phil- osophical foundation for the wilderness movement, George Perkins Marsh probably should be viewed as the key precursor of both the Pro- gressive conservation movment, and, for lack of a better term, what we will call the ecology movement.5 Many hallmarks of the Progressive conservation movement are found in Marsh's Man and Nature (1864), including wise use, reclamation, and balance between "progress" and environmental quality.6 While certainly not anti-technology, Marsh re- alized what many people fail to see even today: Manipulation of the environment for human purposes often produces unforeseen undesir- able consequences, and more power to do good means more power to destroy, too, even if by accident or ignorance. "These intentional changes and substitutions [of foreign plant and animal species for indig- enous ones by human settlers] constitute ... great revolutions; but vast as is their magnitude and importance, they are ... insignificant in com- parison with the contingent and unsought results which have flowed from them."7 Drawing on the history of civilizations felled con- currently with their forests, Marsh argued persuasively that the destruc- tive potential of these "unsought results" required a new sense of re- sponsibility.8 Balance, moderation and use without abuse are essential, since the welfare and even survival of civilization are at risk. Marsh's emphasis on balance between the unknown needs of nature and the needs of man was to reemerge as a major theme of the ecology move- ment, following a period of deemphasis by the Progressive conserva- tionists, to which we now turn. The gradual disappearance of the American frontier escaped widespread social recognition until the appearance in 1893 of Frederick Jackson Turner's The Significance of the Frontier in American History. Combined with the anti-trust mood of the nation as reflected in the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), the stage was now set for the Progressive conservation movement. This movement was populist and pragmatic, integrating anti-monopoly sentiment and the closing of the geographic frontier with democratic ideals and the basic conservation ideas of ear-</page><page sequence="5">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1743 lier thinkers. The Progressive conservation movement was clearly not ecological or preservationist, and did not question the basic materialis- tic, utilitarian philosophical orientation of American capitalism. Gifford Pinchot credits WJ McGee, another principal of this move- ment, with the famous statement of conservation policy: "the use of the natural resources for the greatest good to the greatest number for the longest time."9 Although elements of human-nature balance are found in this move- ment, Pinchot's three "principles of conservation" demonstrate the fo- cus on public management for wise use: "The first principle of conservation is development, the use of the natural resources now ex- isting on this continent for the benefit of the people who live here now.... In the second place conservation stands for the prevention of waste.... [Third,] natural resources must be developed and preserved for the benefit of the many, and not merely for the profit of a few."'0 While the Progressive conservation movement captured the national political mood, the seeds of a related, but more radical environmental movement had sprouted. The Transcendentalists rejected materialism and utilitarianism and offered religious arguments in their stead. Tho- reau and Ralph Waldo Emerson perceived spiritual wealth in nature, arguing that people receive benefit directly from the environment. In the same spirit, John Muir, a cofounder of the Sierra Club in 1892, ar- gued against a water diversion dam near Yosemite Valley: "As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."'"I Wilderness preservation enjoyed limited success when promoted for its spiritual/religious value. (The dam Muir fought so vehemently was built.) But in the 1930s another perspective on wilderness emerged- this one with scientific foundations. Two key figures in this emerging perspective were Robert Marshall and Aldo Leopold. Marshall shared a great deal with the likes of Progressive conservationists Pinchot and McGee, including their utilitarian bent. But Aldo Leopold, a cofounder with Robert Marshall of the Wilderness Society in 1935, broke with the utilitarian ethics of the Progressive conservationists, focusing on the need for human-nature balance and on the means for realizing that bal- ance. Building on the foundation provided by George Perkins Marsh, Leopold argued that social progress and even human survival de- pended ultimately on taking proper care of the land, where "land" refers to all elements of the environment on which life may depend. His sci- entific work led him to an appreciation of the complexity of ecosys- tems, of the fragility of certain ecosystems, and particularly of</page><page sequence="6">1744 James A. Swaney ignorance about ecosystems. While ecologists knew they were just be- ginning to learn about the relationships between various life forms and their environments, the ignorance that concerned Leopold was that our culture failed, in its institutions, to appreciate the central ecological principle that all life forms depend for their survival on the environ- ment in which they live. With such deep-seated ignorance and poten- tially severe consequences, Leopold concluded that neither self-interest nor legislation were sufficient: a new ethic was needed."2 The first ethics dealt with the relation between individuals.... Later ac- cretions dealt with the relation between the individual and society. The Golden Rule tries to integrate the individual to society; democracy to in- tegrate social organization to the individual. There is as yet no ethic dealing with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it.... The land-relation is still strictly economic, entailing privileges but not obligations. The extension of ethics to this third element in human environment is, if I read the evidence correctly, an evolutionary possibility and an eco- logical necessity.'3 Leopold did not advocate that we elevate other species to the impor- tance of people, but rather that we extend rights of existence (and de- rivatively a habitable environment) to all flora and fauna, because it is in our own survival interest to do so. This land ethic implies social obligations of land ownership that extend far beyond the dictates of pecuniary self-interest. "Obligations have no meaning without con- science, and the problem we face is the extension of social conscience from people to land."'4 Aldo Leopold built on the foundation laid down by George Perkins Marsh in the 1 860s, and argued persuasively that a new nonutilitarian land ethic was required. Advocates of the land ethic and the general ecological perspective proliferated in the 1960s and 1970s, but the 1980s has witnessed stagnation, if not retrenchment, of the ecology movement. The narrowly materialistic utilitarian focus of the 1980s, seen by some as a repudiation of the ecology movement, accentuates the urgency of extending ethics to the biosphere. Basic Elements of Environmental Control Theory A neoinstitutionalist theory of environmental control, like any other theory, is based on preconceptions, values, and a fundamental ap- proach to solving problems (methodology). While all three are interre-</page><page sequence="7">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1745 lated, it will be useful to first discuss basic preconceptions (key elements of a worldview), followed by value premises and priorities, and finally key aspects of the approach to problem solving. When particularly acute or revealing, disagreements with orthodox neoclassical econom- ics are introduced, but the intent is to provide a coherent statement of basic elements of an institutionalist environmental economics. Preconceptions Gunnar Myrdal said, "There is no view without a viewpoint."'" Any approach to understanding the natural environment involves a view of natural systems, and any social science perspective on the nat- ural environment includes a view of social systems as well. Hence, an economics of the natural environment includes views on natural sys- tems, social systems, and the interactions between them. Views of nat- ural systems range from what I have called the "quiescent earth mentality" to what we might call the "frail earth mentality."'6 The qui- escent earth mentality assumes that humans are incapable of signifi- cantly altering any of the life support functions of the natural en- vironment. This belief takes many forms. One is the ignorant view that the natural world is composed only of malleable and essentially inert elements, which we can manipulate and transform at will without in- flicting significant damage on human life. A more popular (but also un- informed) belief is that, although human and other life affects the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, the scale of human activity is inconsequential because the biosphere is so big. Robert Solo sum- marizes this attitude nicely: "technology has been developed and de- ployed on the assumption that the biosphere is a depthless sewer [and] that the earth provides a bottomless well of resources."' 7 Still other ver- sions of the quiescent earth mentality are fatalistic-from James Watt's infamous rationalization for environmental abuse (Christ is coming again soon, anyway), to "Whatever happens is the playing out of the forces of evolution." Still another fatalistic view is the radical interpre- tation of the Gaia hypothesis, which views the lithosphere, hydro- sphere, and atmosphere as one Big System having an irrevocable equilibrating inertia. Even if true, we may throw the system so far out of equilibrium that, while the evolution of life may continue, homo sapiens may become extinct.'8 At the other extreme, the frail earth mentality assumes that ecosys- tems generally exhibit a fragile, tenuous equilibrium, and that man- kind's only hope for survival is to "return to nature," excepting the technology of birth control. While the frail earth mentality is also ill-</page><page sequence="8">1746 James A. Swaney informed, it is held by only a few radical environmentalists. Because so few share this mentality, and those who do have little political or economic power, the frail earth mentality is far less dangerous to hu- man progress than the quiescent earth mentality. The institutionalist belief is between the two extremes, although some institutionalists appear to be quite close to the quiescent earth mentality.'9 Generally, institutionalists recognize that the biosphere- life on earth and the physical elements on which it depends-is com- posed of innumerable interacting, interdependent, complex, evolving ecosystems. Some of these systems are very resilient, while others are very fragile. When altered by human activity some evolve into new, stable ecosystems favorable to human habitation, while others degen- erate.20 Three key points highlight the institutionalist position on the stabil- ity of the environment. First, one important lesson of ecology is the complexity and interrelatedness of ecosystems. Aldo Leopold commu- nicates this perspective with the concept "ecological chain of cause and effect."2' When the chain has only one or two links, people see those links and, in some cases, take appropriate action. Leopold's example was the institutional change that resulted when people learned of the threat to the egret population. A contemporary example is the attempt to stop the slaughter of elephants for their ivory tusks. The ban against the use of chlorofluorocarbons as aerosol repellents in the United States to protect ozone in the atmosphere demonstrates that social awareness can be aroused, albeit slowly, when the chain of cause and effect has three or four links. This is progress, certainly, but it is excruciatingly and dangerously slow progress. Ecological chains are not only long, they are multidirectional and interconnected. Much research is required if the full effects of a break in a chain are to be anticipated. Second, knowledge and its application is the key to progress. With enough knowledge, human manipulation of the environment in pursuit of human improvement can proceed apace, since harmful breaks in ecological chains and the accompanying consequences can be avoided. Just as important, however, is the other side of the coin: Ignorance of ecological chains of cause and effect is the primary component of envi- ronmental disaster. Related to the first two points is the third: knowledge and its appli- cation have reached the point where we can no longer afford to forge ahead with the quiescent earth mentality. The power of the scientific process includes the power to degrade the environment as well as the power to improve upon it. Robert Solo put it this way:</page><page sequence="9">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1747 Throughout his habitat on earth, [man's] technologies have been formed on the assumption that the autonomous system that produces the envi- ronment needed for life cannot be reached by what we do nor destroyed by us. And here, I think, a crucial change has come. The life system itself is no longer beyond the reach of man's technology nor beyond his power to disarrange, degrade, and destroy. This is a danger no age has ever faced before.22 The neoinstitutionalist view of the social system, as stated in the in- troduction, is evolutionary, organic, and holistic. Institutionalists view the pursuit of knowledge and its application as the primary source of human progress, with habits of thought and behavior in combination with status-quo-preserving forces of power as the primary restraints on progress. Because society is organic (that is, society has needs that are different from the sum of the needs or wants of individuals), and be- cause power is distributed neither equally nor fairly among individuals in our political economy, institutionalists believe some degree of social control is required. In the terminology of Karl Polanyi, institutionalists reject the market mentality.23 In other words, a mixed economy is re- quired.24 Given the complexity of natural systems and humankind's rapidly expanding power to break ecological chains, institutionalists see the interaction of social and natural systems as additional nails in the coffin of the market mentality. Even if all resources were privately owned, all markets were perfectly competitive, and the distribution of income and wealth was fair, the free market would fail us because in- dividual pursuit of individual objectives would produce socially unde- sirable outcomes. This is true even if transactions costs are zero, because future generations have no "votes" in today's marketplace. Those who would extend the assumptions of a fair income and wealth distribution, perfectly competitive markets, and zero transactions costs into the indefinite future are engaged in a tautological fairy tale. Values Paraphrasing Frank H. Knight, the phrase "technical efficiency" is mneaningless because efficiency is a thoroughly and inherently value- laden term. Greater efficiency usually means accomplishing more with fixed (valuable) inputs, or producing the same value of output with fewer valued inputs. Increasing the output of acid rain is not an im- provement in efficiency because acid rain is not a valued output. Institutionalists imply more than this when they insist that goals or values, not efficiency, are the main issue.25 Wants are determined in</page><page sequence="10">1748 James A. Swaney significant part within the economy and in large part within the culture, and the structure of wants depends on the existing distribution of in- come and wealth. Furthermore, society is organic, with values, needs, and wants separate from, and in addition to, the mere aggregation of individual wants. Finally, both individual and social values are hierar- chical and cannot be reduced to a common yardstick. For example, we value life on a different, "higher level" than we value automobiles. Economists often point out that the statement, "You cannot place a dollar value on a human life," is irrational because dollar-priced re- sources are (not) in fact allocated to life-saving uses. This line of rea- soning misses the point that people avoid such comparisons precisely because they consider life to be "above" dollar measure. For all of these reasons, values cannot generally be taken as exogenous for the purpose of economic inquiry.26 One of three important value problems listed by Allan Gruchy in an early issue of this journal, is to what extent does conventional economics ignore the social costs of economic growth in the form of external diseconomies such as air and water pollution, the spoilation of the natural environment, and the de- struction of the nation's historical heritage by the bulldozer and the spec- ulating land developer-all of which lower the quality of life.27 The instrumental value criteria of the continuity of human life, the noninvidious re-creation of community, and the corollary of environ- mental compatibility, explained in the introduction, form the core of institutionalist values. In adjusting patterns of behavior (institutional adjustment), these values can be expressed in the context of "principles of institutional adjustment." J. Fagg Foster developed three such prin- ciples: technological determination, recognized interdependence, and minimal dislocation. These principles describe, and may be used to fa- cilitate adjustment of the institutional structure, and are particularly useful when technologically induced problems arise in the social struc- ture.28 If technology is defined very broadly, as by many institutionalists of the Ayresian school, there is no possibility for any other source of in- stitutional stress. When problems arise from the environment, they are nonetheless considered as having a technological cause because all problems within the institutional structure are by definition technology-induced. Many environmental problems arise as unin- tended byproducts of economic activity and therefore have technologi- cal roots insofar as economic activity involves application of</page><page sequence="11">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1749 knowledge to the material world. One can also argue that environmen- tal problems arise from not knowing enough, which is of course true, but it is also of little help. The power of modem technology guarantees that application of knowledge to solve particular problems will in some cases interfere with ecosystem production of life-support services. The ozone depletion of the upper atmosphere is one instance where we have enough knowledge to know we have a problem. To argue that we need more knowledge begs the issue. Of course we need more knowledge, but what is the prudent course of action in the interim? And what of other pending problems that have not yet been discovered? We hope there are none, but the odds that there are grow as a product of the rash, "do it now and learn of the consequences later" attitude of technologi- cal optimists and those with financial or other shortsighted, narrow in- terests. "Learning by doing" is an obsolete, ceremonial attitude in our world of modem chemistry, physics, and biology. We must change our at- titude to "planning ahead." We must learn to think of avoiding those applications of knowledge that will ultimately do more harm than good, and we must obtain the knowledge necessary to make informed planning decisions. To argue that technology will come to the rescue is to miss the scale of the problem, the importance of ecological systems for human wellbeing, the power of modern technology for harm as well as for good, the extent of our ignorance, or the limitations of modern western science. The Veblenian dichotomy, from which Foster's principles are de- rived, is an appropriate tool for analyzing sociosystem evolution, and if technology is defined broadly enough, it can also be used to analyze sociosystem and ecosystem coevolutionary development potential. But can a tool that has been developed, designed, and used to analyze the interaction of technology (the application of knowledge to the material world) and institutions in sociosystems be a good tool for analyzing the effects of sociosystems on ecosystems? Even when highly developed, can we expect this tool to serve well as a mechanism for understanding how altered ecosystems react back upon sociosystems? Is a tool that was developed to understand and analyze the processes by which ad- vancing knowledge and its application create, and eventually over- come, institutional stress be expected to also analyze and explain the level of warranted ecosystem ignorance? I think not. The Veblenian di- chotomy is a model "of sociosystem evolution, not of ecosystem or gen- eral evolution. As such, attempts to incorporate ecological problems within [this] model are likely to miss the mark. After all, coevolution</page><page sequence="12">1750 James A. Swaney is the study of separate but interrelated systems evolving together."29 If the Veblenian dichotomy is a less than ideal tool for analyzing sociosystem-ecosystem coevolution, then the value criteria of environ- mental compatibility will be difficult to specify within that framework. Foster's principles of institutional adjustment, derived as they are from the Veblenian dichotomy, also come up short. Technological determi- nation, Foster's first principle, states that, since we cannot unknow what we have just learned, and since technological innovations are the direct cause of social problems, knowledge and technology are also the means for solving social problems (properly adjusting the institutional structure). "Not only is technology determinate of institutional prob- lems in the sense that it creates such problems, but also it is determinate of the solutions in the sense that it constitutes the basic data which must be taken as given in social problems."30 Since environmental problems arise from the indirect effects of human activity (and from natural phe- nomena), social problems arise from environmental change, as well as from technological change. In other words, institutional stress arises not only directly from new knowledge and its application, but also from the effects of that application on the evolving biosphere (and from nat- ural biospheric change) and from the impact of that biospheric change on the social system. Entire civilizations have been wiped out by envi- ronmental feedback effects from applying new tools for (apparent) problem solving purposes. Only recently has technology become pow- erful enough to disrupt the biosphere sufficiently to risk wiping out homo sapiens. The principle of coevolutionary sustainability is a first step toward supplementing Foster's principles and pursuing the criteria of environ- mental compatibility. Coevolutionary sustainability means simply that development paths or applications of knowledge that "pose serious threats to continued compatibility of sociosystem and ecosystem evo- lution should be avoided."'31 Coevolutionary sustainability explicitly recognizes that environmental systems evolve interdependently along development paths that may or may not be sustainable. Currently, hu- man activity is breaking existing ecological chains and establishing new ones that alter the potential paths for further evolution. A particular path, once taken, cannot easily be retraced, and an unsustainable path may be followed for a considerable time before its dead-end becomes apparent. While the evolution of life will probably continue, there is no guarantee that human life will be part of that evolution. Thus, far more research is needed to assure that institutional adjustment is con- sistent with a sustainable coevolutionary development path. Institu-</page><page sequence="13">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1751 tional adjustment that violates this principle also violates the environmental compatibility value criterion. There are innumerable circumstances in which provision of sufficient material goods and ser- vices dictate human intrusion into the environments of other species, but that intrusion must not be such as to threaten any of the options for sustainable human coevolutionary development paths: "The appli- cation of the economic criterion [of instrumental efficiency] ... is gen- erally to be conditioned by and subject to the constraints of the ecological criterion."32 One proposal for implementing environmental compatibility is an "Environmental Bill of Rights," which "would establish as an in- alienable right, the right to an amenable and healthy environment."33 Unfortunately, we were closer to acknowledging the need for this right when Harold Wolozin's proposal was published in 1971 than we are now. While the question of inalienable rights is examined more fully below in the section, "Property Rights and Entitlements," one additional note is appropriate at this juncture. Wolozin, in the above-quoted article, argues for a national view of environment rights. Gunnar Myrdal makes a compelling case for a global view: As regards the environmental problem, it does matter that impending dangers are brought to the attention of everybody.... Nationally, this implies being really prepared to accept "a new style of life.". . . Inter- nationally, it means we could become prepared to permit the intergovern- mental organizations. . . to work more effectively as matrices for gov- ernment cooperation. This would also require ... greater generosity on the part of people in the developed countries. From that moral issue we cannot escape.34 International cooperation is required to address regional and global en- vironmental problems. At this writing, the United States is attempting to initiate global cooperation to address the ozone problem. At a re- gional level, countries in the Mediterranean Basin formed the Mediter- ranean Environment Program under auspices of the United Nations in 1975. This program has been credited with reversing the deterioration of water quality in the Mediterranean Sea, demonstrating that regional cooperation can succeed.35 The value corollary of environmental compatibility and the institu- tional adjustment principle of coevolutionary sustainability are consis- tent with Leopold's land ethic. The environment must be treated with respect, and people must develop a sense of obligation to the environ-</page><page sequence="14">1752 James A. Swaney ment.36 Leopold goes one step further, suggesting "that birds should continue as a matter of biotic right."37 This extension of rights to other species is not anthropomorphism run amuck, but rather a cautious sci- entific proposal. Our level of ignorance regarding ecological chains of cause and effect is so high (even among ecologists, let alone the rest of us), and our ability to break these ecological chains is so great, that it behooves us to consider granting all species existence rights. We should adopt such an ethic not because other animals are as valuable as hu- mans, but because such an ethic would provide insurance against the possibility of scrambling up a dead-end evolutionary development path. Methodology The approach to inquiry and the goals of that approach make up the methodology of inquiry. The treatment of methodology for environ- mental economics is here limited to discussion of three basic frameworks for analysis, and the interrelationships between these frameworks. A more extensive discussion of institutionalist method- ology appears in the previous (September 1987) issue of this journal. This section serves to clarify this author's position, particularly regard- ing differences with the article, "Resources Are Not; They Become: An Institutional Theory," by Thomas R. DeGregori in the September 1987 issue of this journal.38 Zimmerman on Resources Since many resources come from the natural environment, a perspec- tive on resources is an important part of an understanding of the envi- ronment. Institutionalists find a functional approach to resources most useful, often following Erich Zimmermann: "The word 'resource' does not refer to a thing nor a substance but to a function which a thing or a substance may perform.... The word 'resource' is an abstraction re- flecting human appraisal and relating to a function or operation."39 Zimmermann's point is that resources do not exist apart from their use- fulness to people. For example, uranium became a resource only when a use for it was discovered. While the functional approach is not unique to Zimmermann, his emphasis on knowledge in "human appraisal" is unusually strong. "Re- sources become" by applying knowledge to "physical reality."40 Thus, nman's own wisdom is his premier resource-the key resource that unlocks the universe.'`" Rapid economic growth in the modern era is</page><page sequence="15">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1753 the product of the growth and application of knowledge to a substan- tially unchanged earth. For example, the oil in the lithosphere has been there for a long time, but became a resource only when humans learned how to use it for their advantage. Knowledge is truly the mother of all other resources. To be sure, not even omniscience can create matter or energy out of nothing. Nor can any sci- ence, no matter how skillful and advanced, ever restore to human use the energy once locked up in coal, oil, or gas, but now spent. The difference between neolithic man, who roamed the earth in misery and fear, and man today, who lives in relative comfort and security, is knowledge and the marvelous apparatus of cultural improvements which knowledge has de- vised and built for its own application. Freedom and wisdom, the fruits of knowledge, are the fountainhead of resources.42 While Zimmermann was certainly an optimist, we see here and else- where a concern with energy. Zimmermann stated, "the energy basis is truly the foundation of a civilization," and he recognized the implica- tion of the second law of thermodynamics, that "the 'quality' of energy tends to deteriorate."43 An "entropy doomsayer" Zimmermann obvi- ously was not, but, in language similar to that of Nicholas Georgescu- Roegen nearly forty years later, he recognized the need to harness solar energy directly "by turning sunshine into inanimate energy."44 Zim- mermann's concern was that our economy, based on an exhaustible stock of fossil fuels, was unsustainable. "A civilization based on a fund of exhaustible resources cannot be permanent.... A civilization based on a flow of renewable resources may be permanent."45 For analysis of the environment, the central concern is not with in- creasing entropy per se, although our development path clearly requires an eventual transition from reliance on stored-up solar energy to direct utilization of solar flux. The proper concern is with the symptoms of high entropy peculiar to our development path. The carbon dioxide problem is illustrative. Our preponderance of ignorance regarding the ecological disruption that will result from increasing levels of atmo- spheric carbon dioxide is no excuse for continuing present trends of deforestation and fossil fuel combustion. We may have enough coal for several hundred years, but we are playing Russian roulette with more than one live round if we insist on burning that coal at an increasing rate. Although nuclear energy avoids the carbon dioxide problem, heat pollution and very long-term containment requirements for spent reac- tors and fuel render this option far from an "environmental bargain," even if major accidents can be avoided. Thus, while deterioration in the quality of energy (rising entropy) is a long-term problem, the symp-</page><page sequence="16">1754 James A. Swaney toms of this deterioration are of immediate concern for ecological sta- bility.46 Clarence Ayres developed a similar position on resources, although his optimism was unrestrained by potential energy shortages, which concerned Zimmermann. The primary difference between Ayres and Zimmermann on resources is Ayres's emphasis on ceremonial re- straints to growth. For Zimmermann, "Nature sets the limits within which man can develop his arts to satisfy his wants."47 Ayres, on the other hand, "found the limits to growth within man, not only within his institutions... but also within his limited know-how. This is a ... substantially different alternative to an analysis which finds that the limits to growth lie in the biosphere, outside of man."48 As hinted by the previous discussions of Leopold's land ethic and the quiescent earth mentality, I find Ayres's position incomplete. The rising probability that mankind's activities will inadvertently disrupt critical functions of our ecosystem poses a significant threat to future coevolutionary development. However, the limits to growth debate is beyond the scope of this paper.49 Although Zimmermann seems close to the quiescent earth mentality when he states that "the physical universe may be constant, [and] the planet earth may undergo few changes speedy and substantial enough to affect materially the destiny of man," he was aware of the growing threat of unanticipated environmental costs.50 "At times [man] over- reaches himself in his attempt to improve on nature. Inadequately aware of the importance of balances and equilibria which the ecologist is gradually revealing, he succeeds in gaining a little now at the expense of greater loss later on."5' Zimmermann's functional approach to re- sources thus emphasizes the predominant role of knowledge in creating resources, while it also recognizes that the biosphere limits this poten- tial. Limits arise, on the one hand, from the properties and characteris- tics of available matter and energy, and, on the other hand, from ignorance of ecological chains of cause and effect. Neither of these con- straints are subsumed under the Ayresian context of the term "institu- tional resistance." Pearce on Functions of the Natural Environment In his Environmental Economics, D. W. Pearce identifies four functions of the natural environment: "supplying 'natural goods' ... natural resources which are used to create economic goods, a 'sink', and an integrated .., system providing the means whereby all life-</page><page sequence="17">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1755 forms are sustained."5S2 "Natural goods" include wilderness, landscape, scenic wonders, and the like, and the "sink" refers to the fact that all wastes from the economy are disposed of in the natural environment. Pearce argues that the natural goods, natural resources, and sink func- tions, but not the life-support function, can be accommodated by tradi- tional welfare economics. There are problems in such an accommodation, but square pegs can be made to fit into round holes if enough is whittled off the corners. Pearce's key point is that the life support system cannot be made to fit into the neoclassical framework because it is not produced, and because it is indivisible both sectorally and temporally. It can only be analyzed and understood as an evolving natural system that cannot be priced or otherwise allocated by the econ- omy. For the other three functions of the natural environment, an effi- cient property rights structure can be designed, although high transaction costs, poor information, the free rider problem, nonrivalry in consumption, and fugitive resources present major practical prob- lems. But for the life support system, an efficient property rights struc- ture is conceptually (as well as practically) untenable. Coddington on Ecology and Economics Three functions of the natural environment identified by Pearce-natural goods, natural resources, and the life support system- provide flows of services into the social system and the economy, whereas the sink function is a flow of disservices from the economy back into the natural environment. This return flow Alan Coddington calls "discommodities."53 Consumption is the process of transforming commodities-desirables subject to allocation by individual initiative and private property-into discommodities-undesirables subject to abandonment or other disposal that become a "possession of society at large."54 Coddington offers a simple but enlightening expansion of the simple circular flow model, reproduced below as Figure 1. The arrow from the environment to the household, EH, represents the flow of natural goods and life-support services, such as greenery and clean air, whereas the return arrow, HE, represents discommodities from the household, rep- resenting part of the sink function of the natural environment. The ar- row from the environment to the firm, EF, represents natural resources, including energy and raw materials, while the return arrow, FE, repre- sents the flow of discommodities from firms to the environment. In addition to natural resources, the flow from the environment to firms</page><page sequence="18">1756 James A. Swaney also includes life-support system flows, such as oxygen for breathing by workers and for combustion of fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide for "breathing" by farmers' fields. The arrows FH and HF represent the familiar flows of goods and services and household-provided resources, Figure 1: Coddington's Simple Flow Model firms 4 - &lt; ~~~~~~~FH | HF environment EH a households respectively. Coddington points out that John Kenneth Galbraith's key concern in The Affluent Society is "the conflict between FH (consump- tion) and EH (amenities)," and E. J. Mishan's concern in The Costs of Economic Growth is that more consumption (IFH) implies more nat- ural resource use (lEF) and more discommodity disposal (IHE and tFE) .55 Coddington concludes that both Galbraith and Mishan are right: The narrow focus of economists on increasing consumption (TFH) and natural resource use (TEF) is reducing the potential future flows from the environment (jEF; IEH). The result Coddington calls "overdevelopment."56 Technology can, at least to some extent, resolve these problems, but it will do so only if we focus our research and other</page><page sequence="19">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1757 creative energies away from narrow economic growth toward conflict- ing uses of the environment and interdependence of producing units, households, and the environment. In conclusion, a functional approach to the environment recognizes that: * Natural goods production, which is often competitive with natural resource production, is restricted in quality and quantity by the pro- duction of effluents from both households and firms. * Natural resources, whether viewed as "existing" physical stocks or as "becoming" in relation to knowledge of how to use the universe's matter and energy, represent only one of four functions of the nat- ural environment, and provide only part of one of the two flows from the environment to the economy. * Production of life support services by the environment is hampered and increasingly threatened by growth in the production of eco- nomic goods through increased flows both from the environment to firms and from firms and households back into the environment. * The sink function of the natural environment can no longer be taken for granted because overloading the sinks increasingly inter- feres with the environment's other three functions (producing nat- ural goods, natural resources, and life support services), violating environmental compatibility and threatening coevolutionary sus- tainability. Knowledge is the key component of progress. Erich Zimmermann recognized this fact and made it the cornerstone of his perspective on resources. Yet Zimmermann did not argue, as did some of Clarence Ayres's students, that humans are limited only by lack of knowledge and by dated habits of thought and behavior. Zimmermann recognized that nature imposes limitations, and that mankind is capable of dis- rupting ecosystems. Limitations, then, are four: (1) insufficient knowl- edge of how to use elements of the earth to human advantage; (2) availability and physical properties of matter and energy; (3) inap- propriate institutions for the level of knowledge and its potential for instrumental application; and (4) ignorance of ecosystems and their in- teractions with sociosystems, primarily the unanticipated side effects and feedbacks that turn immediate gains into long-term losses. Modern technology has brought many gains, but the eventual costs will be far greater than the extreme technological optimists imagine. Our use of the environment as unlimited sink and free garbage disposal</page><page sequence="20">1758 James A. Swaney (TFE and THE) interferes with ecosystem production and delivery of natural goods (EF and EH), and with current and potential flows of natural resources (EF). Furthermore, abuse of the sink function threat- ens the life-sustaining function of natural systems (which appears in Coddington's model as an additional component of the EH flow). The threat is not depletion of natural resources (EF-O), but disrup- tion of environmental functions by reckless application of modem technology and other abuses of the environment. Avoidance of this threat requires abandonment of obsolete habits of thought and pursuit of knowledge and technology that allows us to anticipate and avoid environmental mistakes instead of merely trying to adjust to the con- sequences after the fact. The quiescent earth mentality, universal tech- nological beneficence, and technological autonomy are three beliefs that must be discarded before ecological problems can be adequately addressed. We must recognize our dependency on ecosystems, our growing power to interfere with and degrade crucial ecosystem func- tions, and our ignorance of ecosystem functions combined with rising knowledge requirements. Conceptual Issues This section addresses three broad topics familiar to most students of economics. While not exhaustive, these three topics present a cohe- sive body of neoinstitutional theory that I hope will provide a basic theoretical structure for furthering the application of institutional thought to environmental problems. The three concepts discussed are social costs, property rights, and economic measurement. Social Costs K. William Kapp published The Social Costs of Private Enterprise in 1950, but it received almost no attention until the 1970s, even from writers sympathetic to Kapp's perspective. Kapp's book was certainly "ahead of its time," and his treatment of social costs can be confusing, but neglect of Kapp's work under the pens of E. J. Mishan, in The Costs of Economic Growth, and John Kenneth Galbraith, in The Affluent So- ciety, is puzzling.57 Economics traditionally defines social cost as total social opportunity cost, but Kapp defines social cost as that part of social opportunity cost remaining after private costs are paid. In other words, Kapp's "social cost" is somewhat analogous to "externality" or "external disecon- omy."</page><page sequence="21">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1759 Kapp was familiar with "externality," tracing it back to A. C. Pigou and Alfred Marshall.58 But Kapp chose "social cost" instead for two reasons. First, the term "externality" in both literal meaning and his- torical context, implies problems that are exceptional rather than per- vasive, and "outside" rather than systemic.59 Neoclassical assumptions and concepts related to externality "do not reveal but conceal," result- ing in "misleading and apologetic" conclusions.60 The fact of the matter is that "social costs are not minor exceptions to the rule but are typical phenomena."'61 As part of neoclassical theory, externality also assumes an exogenous institutional structure, when in fact there is a built-in ten- dency for the market to generate externalities. "The theory of social costs has always regarded this positivistic acceptance of institutions as a severe self-imposed limitation on neoclassical analysis."62 Second, the use of "social cost" in reference to the total cost to society gives the concept "an apparently more harmless meaning than those who prefer to use the term with reference to costs not reflected in con- ventional cost accounts."63 We see that "social cost," a much broader term than "externality," refers to much more than third-party spillover effects in an institution-static, partial equilibrium setting. To Kapp, ris- ing social costs result directly and systematically from the market sys- tem, with harmful impacts on workers and other people in addition to the environment.64 Many market mechanisms are merely "squeezing mechanisms" when power (control of resources and information, ac- cess to legislators, et cetera) on one side of the market is compared to (lack of) power of the other side.65 Kapp's "social cost" thus includes broad classes of social damage wrought by the market system and the forces of power within that system.66 Cost-Shifting Traditional economics texts emphasize how competitive markets weed out inefficient producers and provide a good or service to con- sumers at the lowest possible price. This price allows the "typical firm" to realize just enough profit to stay in business. Resource prices are dic- tated to the firm by competitive input markets, and the firm uses the best available techniques and the minimum cost input combination for each particular amount produced. This scenario presumes that the "rules of the game," both legal and moral, are both static and strictly enforced. But a firm with "below typical" performance already employ- ing the best available (cost-minimizing) technology faces a sorry choice: cut costs or go out of business. Resource prices are beyond the firm's control, but operating costs are not, so the firm may have an incentive</page><page sequence="22">1760 James A. Swaney to employ substandard health or safety measures.67 If it does so, other firms may be forced to follow, thereby reducing the "common denomi- nator" of working conditions. The marginal farmer faces a similarly grim choice: cut costs or quit farming. One way to cut costs may be to practice poor soil conservation practices. It may not be in his long-term interest to do so, because de- terioration of the soil will reduce future crop yields and the value of his land. But a farmer on the brink of bankruptcy has no long-term interest, so he cultivates his field so as to minimize cash outflow, thereby contri- buting to the erosion of centuries worth of topsoil. These examples show that there is a systematic incentive to avoid costs by whatever means, and the more competitive the economy, the greater the pressure. Indeed, costs will be cut wherever the gains (avoided costs) exceed the entrepreneurial effort expended. When costs are successfully avoided, the firm's accounting costs, but often not the social opportunity costs of production, are reduced. Society's total costs may even be increased as violators of ethical or legal rules find it worth- while to produce misinformation. The resources thereby expended, and the resources society expends to produce good information, prosecute criminals, and clean up after "midnight dumpers," are deadweight so- cial costs. Cost reductions of this type, arising as they do from avoiding costs rather than reducing costs, we call cost-shifting. K. William Kapp ad- dressed this tendency to shift costs in a competitive economy in this journal a decade ago: It is inevitable that in a market economy dominated by the desire to mini- mize entrepreneurial costs and to maximize net entrepreneurial returns, social costs and environmental damage tend to be "externalized" as far as possible within the existing institutional and legal framework, while ap- propriable monetary benefits (profits) will be internalized.... Any eco- nomic unit .., which operates within the market nexus and is tied to national or international competition will tend to keep its own entrepre- neurial costs at a minimum even though the chosen input and output pat- terns will give rise to discharges of pollutants with a negative impact on the quality of the environment and hence on third persons, other firms, and society at large. Hence market systems may be said to have an insti- tutionalized "built-in" tendency to reinforce environmental disruption and social costs.68 A more competitive economy will put more pressure on firms to avoid costs, whether by employing improved production techniques that actually allow greater production with the same set of inputs, or by shifting costs onto workers, the social infrastructure, or the environ-</page><page sequence="23">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1761 ment. Firms in a less competitive environment face the same type of pressure when decision makers (whether private or public) are evalu- ated in traditional accounting terms. That is, pressures to shift costs arise from traditional accounting practices as well as from competition. Cost-shifting also occurs when technical advance is not technological advance. Employment of new techniques, assumed by many neoclas- sical and institutional economists to represent technological advance, in some cases represents an application of knowledge that merely im- proves the efficiency of the accounting identity at the expense of the sociosphere or biosphere. Such cost shifting should not be interpreted as malevolent behavior because the firm is merely trying to reduce its costs. However, technical advance is unethical when workers are sub- jected to health hazards or excessive monotony.69 A far greater portion of technical advance would be unethical if we extended ethics to the environment as suggested by Aldo Leopold. Unethical or not, much of what passes for technological advance is nothing more than well dis- guised cost-shifting. The semantic distinction between "mere" technical advance and "true" technological advance points out that technical change may re- duce private outlays while it increases, often by an equal or greater amount, the costs that must be borne by others. Only when society's total costs are reduced by the technical change is that change a techno- logical advance.70 The point is simply that technological change may have harmful effects that partially offset or even totally outweigh its benefits. Many institutionalists are willing to judge technology by weighing its overall effects. For example, Anne Mayhew "see(s) no problem in an Ayresian institutionalist arguing that there are limits imposed by the biosphere [and] that we should proceed with caution in using new tech- nologies."7' Han Yu Lee and F. Gregory Hayden suggest that "careful assessment of harmful effects and their long-run consequences, as well as beneficial effects, of every technological change need to be made con- tinuously and responsibly."72 Technological change is not synonymous with furthering the life pro- cess unless, of course, one insists on defining technology as progressive. This device, used by several contemporary institutionalists, conve- niently allows summary dismissal of all technology critics.73 Notable among those who define technology as progressive (and gen- erally believe that technology is universally beneficent) is Thomas R. DeGregori: "By definition, all technology, if it is truly technology, is appropriate to some problem-solving endeavor."74 "The uniqueness to humans of technology is that it is productive, open-ended, and there-</page><page sequence="24">1762 James A. Swaney fore inherently developmental."75 "Technology ... is a problem- solving process. When a set of tools designed to solve one set of problems is applied to different problems, it is understandable if those tools do not always work. It does not mean the technology failed, merely that the technology was incorrectly used."76 So defined, the crit- ics are easily dismissed. DeGregori nevertheless recognizes that tech- nology may create major problems, although his discussion of these problems is very limited.77 Time and again DeGregori attacks advocates of appropriate and in- termediate technology. These attacks are persuasive primarily because DeGregori relies on the underlying definition of modem technology as progressive. This tautological approach is unfortunate, because some of DeGregori's criticisms are warranted.78 Utilizing an analytic defini- tion of technology (volitional application of knowledge to the material world) allows inquiry to proceed without defining away the problem at the outset. DeGregori's discussion of ozone and carbon dioxide atmospheric problems ("phenomena with a very large potential for damage") recog- nizes that modem technology's "scale for good and destruction is so great that we do not want to take needless chances."79 Unfortunately, he then concludes: "The prudent course is to continue to study and monitor the situation and be prepared to take effective remedial action if our understanding of the trends warrants it."80 This recommendation denies the gravity of the problem. What is worse, it shows ignorance of our collective level of ignorance, and of the importance of that igno- rance. What if we fail to understand in time? In some circumstances, ignorance may be bliss. In this case, ignorance may be terminal. De- Gregori writes in one stroke of the pen that we need to study and mon- itor, in another stroke that we do not want to take needless chances, and in a third stroke that no immediate action is called for. The only way this author can reconcile the third with the first two is to suggest that DeGregori embraces the quiescent earth mentality: the belief that our alteration of the environment is not and will not disturb the natural production of life-support services within the biosphere. Two implications of the cost-shifting concept are apparent. First, since technological change is not autonomous and, because of cost- shifting, does not always imply human improvement, both technology and traditional accounting costs must be assessed for social improve- ment. Continued development and improvement of social indicators and nonmarket assessment models and techniques are essential. Sec- ond, cost-shifting implies that the burden on society and hence on pub-</page><page sequence="25">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1763 lic resources will continue to grow. Not only does society have to pay for costs shifted onto workers and society in the form of health effects, safety hazards, environmental cleanup and the like, society must also assume responsibility for production of services that used to be pro- vided for free, courtesy of the ecosystem.8' Cost-shifting onto the envi- ronment has increased as the social protection of labor has reduced the cost-shifting options in that arena and as technology has advanced. Cost-shifting technological advance has been particularly acute in en- ergy and chemicals. "The intense environmental impact of the petro- chemical industry is due to serious incompatibilities with the chemical processes inherent in the ecosystem and essential to its stability."82 Three types of cost-shifting have been identified: (1) those that di- rectly violate ethical standards, such as subjecting workers to unsafe conditions or practicing high-erosion agricultural techniques; (2) those that employ mere technological advance, such as pesticides that poison surface water, workers, and consumers; and (3) those that involve envi- ronmental disruption so severe as to force society to "take over" pro- duction of life support services that were previously free. These three types are neither independent nor exhaustive, but rather illustrative. Nevertheless, the point is clear: firms or other accounting identities are rewarded for internalizing benefits and externalizing costs in an envi- ronment of grossly inadequate legal and ethical restraints. Externality: Market Failure or Failure of the Market? Although the externality concept developed historically as an anomaly, some traditional economists have addressed the externality question and concluded that (a) externalities are the rule, and (b) assumptions of good information and low transactions costs make for interesting but irrelevant theorizing.83 The analysis of social cost to this point goes much further, suggesting that externalities are unavoidable, systematic, prolific products of the market system. Cost-shifting is endemic, and will continue to grow, bounded only by growing public budgets and the disruption of the flow of life-support services from the environment. Kapp's disdain for the term "externality" was justified, as was his con- clusion: Environmental disruption cannot be explained adequately as a case of market-failure, unless the term is understood in the sense of the failure of the market system and of conventional economics to come to terms with interdependencies and complex causal chains which have long ceased to occupy a peripheral place in modern industrial societies and are bound to</page><page sequence="26">1764 James A. Swaney assume increasing significance as residual industrial waste products and debris are permitted to be discarded freely into the environment.84 In addition to cost-shifting, the market system also generates addi- tional sociological costs through its promotion of labor mobility, im- personality, and market-defined values. "This type of technological innovation favored by the growth-oriented economy is undoubtedly such as to reduce over time the need for direct communication and direct dependence between men.... The direct flow of communication and sympathy between people becomes ever thinner.85 The erosion of community that has accompanied the modem era similarly erodes the freedom to create, define, and prioritize values in interaction with sig- nificant others.86 Along with increasing product complexity and media access to households, particularly through television, this erosion con- tributes to ever-expanding opportunities for marketers to define con- sumers' values for them.87 One result is that marketing is a growth industry. Another result is that products of the economy become more important than people. Combined with less direct reliance on others, the outcome is less concern with the third-party costs of any particular action, or an increase in externalities. Hence, externalities are social phenomena: "Technical externalities are not purely technical, but are, to varying degrees, products of the market mentality and the break- down of community."88 The implication is that a revival in human eth- ics and the extension of ethics to the environment is required. The problem is so deeply embedded in the system that no combination of government involvement and private property rights holds much hope of providing a solution. Property Rights and Entitlements: The "Property Rights" School Much of the contemporary literature on property rights traces its roots to the classic 1960 article on social cost by Ronald Coase. Coase and his followers challenged A. C. Pigou's long-standing conclusion that externalities required government intervention with the argument that the two parties to an externality-the "producer" and the "consumer" could strike a bargain. Coase's conclusion was that re- source allocation after the bargain would be efficient, regardless of which party was legally "in the right" to begin with. All that is required for this outcome, said Coase, is good information, zero transactions (bargaining) costs, and a well-defined set of property rights. Based on this and subsequent related arguments, several contemporary econo- mists advocate "privatization" as the solution to all problems of social</page><page sequence="27">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1765 cost. Under a comprehensive structure of efficient private property rights, all resources would be privately owned and all "third party" effects would be resolved without government interference. These economists, declared Alan Coddington, "may be quite correct within their own frame of reference. What is wrong is that the concep- tual framework itself is irrelevant to the discussion of externalities on the scale on which they are being generated and of the type we witness today."89 Coddington's critique is correct: social costs are expansive, showing no sign of alleviation, and severe social costs are not amenable to bargained solutions. Problems with bargaining are legion. Most pol- lution problems involve large numbers of "producers" (for instance, automobile emissions) or "consumers" (as with air pollution). Some pollution (like acid rain) crosses international boundaries and some is global (the rising carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, for exam- ple). Some is intergenerational as well, rendering bargaining impossi- ble. Problems of information and knowledge are also extensive. Unin- formed workers, consumers, and bystanders are exposed to insidious and chronic contaminants, and underfunded scientists studying long and complex ecological cause-effect chains fall further behind in their pursuit of knowledge about the safety of particular substances, let alone the synergistic effects on human health and environmental life support systems. As Larry Swanson has argued forcefully, "the weight of the legal burden of proof needs to be shifted from potential victims and regulators of toxic substances to the producers and purveyors of such inherently dangerous materials."90 Coddington, however, does not go far enough. Social need is not de- termined by aggregating individual wants and willingnesses to pay, so bargained solutions would miss the mark even if they were practical. So- ciety is organic; the distribution of wealth and power is unjust; integrity of environmental life support systems is beyond the reach of individu- als; and future generations are society's responsibility. In short, the property rights school has taken Coase's scientific fiction, which was conceptually useful for understanding a narrow range of externality problems, and turned it into mere dogma. Evolving Entitlements Institutionalists view institutional structures as habits of thought and behavior with embedded goals or objectives. Like other institutional structures, property rights will change if goals or (technological or envi- ronmental) requirements change. It follows that property and property</page><page sequence="28">1766 James A. Swaney rights are not fixed and immutable, although many believe they are, or at least should be. Attempting to bypass such beliefs in pursuit of con- structive analysis, institutionalists often substitute "entitlements" for "property rights."'" Since entitlements are defined and specified by society, social change often involves changes in entitlements. Environmental problems and changes in social goals relating to the environment dictate altered en- titlements. In some cases, this change involves shifting the burden of proof, and in other cases it involves direct rights "attenuation" (redis- tribution).92 While some "property rights" theorists examine the bene- fits and costs of alternative sets of entitlement institutions, their analysis "begs the question of what and whose costs are to be consid- ered."93 Thorough analysis of entitlements is possible only with an "entitle- ments topology" classifying different types of entitlements. Based on an article by Guido Calabresi and A. Douglas Melamed, Daniel W. Bromley has provided such a topology to readers of this journal.94 En- titlements are of three general types: those protected by property rules, those protected by liability rules, and those that are inalienable. Entitle- ments protected by property rules have two possible configurations, de- pending on which party is protected. If A (the "actor" or "producer") is protected by a property rule, B (the "acted upon" or "consumer") can stop A from inflicting harm only by paying him off. On the other hand, if B is protected by a property rule, A cannot "act" or "produce" without B's consent. Property rules are thus P-A or P-B, with P for property, and A or B designating which party is protected. Likewise for liability rules: L-A denotes that if B stops A, B must compensate A; and L-B denotes that A can go ahead, but must compensate B. Compensation amounts are determined by the courts or another "third party." Finally, there is type I for "inalienable," wherein society sets preconditions for action, including the prevention of some bargains. While space does not permit a full explanation, two of Bromley's conclusions are noteworthy. First, the property rights literature con- cerns itself only with P-A and L-B, which works well for producer- producer conflicts (as analyzed by Coase), but not for producer- consumer conflicts. For example, since producers have pollution rights by tradition and prior appropriation, they are protected by a property rule (P-A). If their pollution destroys amenities or life-support services of the environment, consumers have to pay them to not pollute, or rather to return the environment to its "natural state." But if consumers</page><page sequence="29">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1767 (or society) have a property rule for the environment (P-B), the produc- ers (and those who buy their products) will have to pay.95 Second, there are several conditions under which inalienable entitlements make sense. For example, if two upstream river users have a bargain- resolvable conflict, but major damages would thereby be inflicted upon large numbers of downstream users, society should prohibit the bar- gain.96 Inalienable rights may also be appropriate under conditions of ignorance, uncertainty, irreversibilities, and option values.97 Examples of inalienable rights range from a safe minimum standard of conserva- tion for a particular resource, to an environmental Bill of Rights.98 In the broad context of altering entitlements in pursuit of the con- tinuity of human life and environmental compatibility, institutionalist analyses of evolving entitlements published in this journal appear to be important first steps, although more explicit consideration of the en- titlement topology elaborated by Bromley will provide policymakers with clearer alternatives to the property rights school.99 Economic Measurement Environmental economic analysis is concerned with evaluating pol- icy options and with measuring the value of output. Tne first task is one of judging alternative resource allocations. Neoclassical econo- mists generally prefer to leave this task to the market, or, if that is not feasible, they employ a market proxy, cost-benefit analysis. Measuring output involves national income and product accounting techniques that aggregate an economy's output as Gross National Product (GNP), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or a similar measure. The analysis to this point is suggestive of the neoinstitutional position on evaluating alternatives and measuring results: traditional measures are very sus- pect. As in other areas, however, unanimity among institutionalists dis- solves when the focus shifts from the shortcomings of traditional measurement techniques to alternatives. Cost-Benefit Analysis Institutionalists contend that all values are not reducible to monetary measures, and that prices are not accurate measures of a resource's value to society, so cost-benefit analysis is immediately suspect.1'? Then there is the discount rate, the mechanism by which benefits and costs in different future time periods are rendered comparable in the present. Discounting is really nothing more than compound interest in</page><page sequence="30">1768 James A. Swaney reverse, but the appropriate rate has been a matter of considerable de- bate. More fundamental is the question of whether discounting is an appropriate concept for public decision-making. Allen V. Kneese, for example, questions nuclear energy because its benefits are immediate, but its high-level wastes must be contained for at least 200,000 years. 10' This raises obvious intergenerational ethics questions, rendering cost- benefit analysis suspect.'02 F. Gregory Hayden rejects discounting from a different perspective, arguing that allocating for social need should not be subservient to an incorrect market-centered, common clock, lin- ear flow model of time.'03 Peter Soderbaum also rejects discounting for at least two fundamen- tal reasons. First, irreversibility "is not the special case but rather the common case."'104 Second, ecology renders discounting incredible: "For those who consider evolutionary processes and the paths that ecosys- tems take over time, the idea that non-monetary impacts at different periods can somehow be pressed together to one point in time via cal- culation of present values is absurd, assuming that we want to know what we are doing."'05 Cost-benefit analysis is also plagued by implicit assumptions. In- come distribution, technology, market structure, entitlements, and con- sumer preferences are all assumed structurally stable, but are all subject to change.106 More fundamental are the assumptions that "more is pre- ferred to less," and "individual preferences count." As shown below, it is increasingly difficult to know when more is really more. More firm- to-household flows often mean fewer environment-to-household and environment-to-firm flows. And while the preferences of individuals certainly do count, so do society's, and what about the preferences of future generations? A valuable summary of the critical literature on this question is provided in the aforementioned Soderbaum article. Alternatives to cost-benefit analysis range from rather conventional cost-effectiveness analysis, where benefits are difficult to measure, to sensitivity analysis, where different scenarios are analyzed under poor information, ignorance, or other uncertainties; to concordance analy- sis, where cost-benefit calculations are subsumed in a multiple criteria framework; to positional analysis, which identifies how interest groups are affected by alternative policy options, seeking conditional conclu- sions.'07 Critics of cost-benefit analysis have demonstrated that the use- fulness of this tool is severely limited; it may be employed to guide allocation decisions only where "cost" and "benefit" have been given an ecology-compatible, coevolutionary-sustainable, and socially just meaning.</page><page sequence="31">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1769 Measuring Output The concept of social cost and the recognition that the natural goods, life support services, and sink functions of the environment are not in- cluded in conventional GNP calculations make the GNP a poor barometer of material well-being. As the sociosystem assumes more functions that were previously provided courtesy of the environment, we actually add to GNP when we should be subtracting. Leopold Kohr called this the " 'aspirin standard': by increasing our GNP we produce headaches; then we produce aspirin to relieve the headaches and pride ourselves that this further increase in GNP has raised our standard of living."'08 Given current trends, a more appropriate metaphor is "co- caine standard." Nor is this all. Consumption is increasingly deter- mined in the marketplace through Galbraith's "revised sequence" and William Leiss's "double ambiguity," rendering "market values" even more suspect. In light of these and other problems, Gunnar Myrdal re- jects GNP and alternative concepts of aggregate utility or well-being as "logically untenable," and Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen argues that the policy toward the future should be to "minimize regrets."'"09 K. William Kapp makes the same point, arguing that "maximizing pleasure" may be replaced, out of necessity, by "minimizing human suffering.""II0 Few institutionalists are so pessimistic, but we continue to roll dice with the environment, and the odds are becoming much worse as the stakes grow higher. Hellbent for measurement, modern Western cultures are not about to abandon GNP and similar measures. Several adjusted GNPs have been proposed, including MEW (Measure of Economic Welfare) and NEW (Net Economic Welfare). NEW attempts to adjust for environ- mental damage, but is "ecoignorant." Recently in this journal, Chris- tian Leipert published a very fine attempt, possibly the first since publication of Kapp's book in 1950, "to develop a comparably broad- based synthesis of the social costs of production."' Leipert classifies social costs and explores "compensatory expendi- tures," which include a wide variety of direct and indirect social costs of environmental disruption."2 Through extensive (downward) adjust- ment of GNP, Leipert's goal is an Eco National Product (ENP). Obvi- ously, this line of work is important, and should be a high neoinstitutionalist research priority. Conclusion Environmental compatibility requires that society adopt the ecology</page><page sequence="32">1770 James A. Swaney or land ethic, which will require a fundamental "emancipation of be- lief." As Aldo Leopold wrote in the late 1 940s: "A system of conserva- tion based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are (as far as we know) essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.""13 When too many parts of the clock are lost, they may be hopelessly beyond retrieval, and the clock repair people may not be able to create replacement parts quickly enough to keep the clock running and thereby avoid significant human suffering. Since institu- tional economics recognizes the importance of scientific knowledge, and, when it comes to ecology, the importance of scientific ignorance, and since institutional economics is openly and avowedly normative, institutionalists have the tools to educate people and to encourage them to question the dominant neoclassical beliefs and values of modem Western society. Environmental compatibility will come into sharp conflict with more cherished values, and tough choices will almost certainly be forced upon us within this century. For example, science may suggest that se- vere curtailment of energy consumption is necessary to slow the buildup of carbon dioxide. Socio-environmental indicators and tech- nology assessment will have to move quickly from the laboratory to the field to educate, to involve people in decision-making, and to alter institutions. Beliefs that were harmless conveniences or even life-enhancing sim- plifications have become ceremonial, life-threatening institutions. Foremost on the list of obsolete habits of thought are the beneficent, autonomous, and universal technology assumptions and the quiescent earth mentality. The power of modem technology is the power to do damage as well as the power to do good. The application of knowledge to a particular problem may very well create more problems than it solves. This is particularly true when the costs can be shifted onto oth- ers who are unaware of what is going on, or who are powerless to do anything about it. The autonomous technology assumption allows a convenient "starting point" for sociosystem analysis, but preempts crucial questions and promising policy agendas. The universal technol- ogy assumption, which suggests that all peoples will learn to develop and use the same tool for a particular problem, ignores cultural and ecological differences. The process of pursuing knowledge and its appli- cation to solving a problem may be more or less universal, but that</page><page sequence="33">Neoinstitutional Environmental Economics 1771 observation does not guide us in assessing whether, when, or where any particular modern technology is the appropriate technology. My mod- em technology may be your recipe for disaster. The quiescent earth mentality is the assumption or belief that the environmental life- support system is inviolable. Entire civilizations have perished under this belief, but it is even more dangerous with modem technology. If assumptions and beliefs are obsolete, then approaches to scientific research and problem solving are probably obsolete, too. The ability of some modern technology to clog environmental sinks, reduce natural goods production, degrade natural resources, and disrupt the life sup- port system suggests that inquiry must become more holistic, employ- ing systems modelling and other techniques that explore interactions, feedbacks, and interrelatedness. The materials balances approach em- ployed by environmental economists is a step in the right direction. Also needed are more developed coevolutionary models capable of projecting interactions between sociosystems and ecosystems and in- stitutions that facilitate communications among scientific specialties. Planning ahead must replace learning by doing, and apparent solutions must be assessed according to immediate and long-term sociosystem and ecosystem effects. Global pollution problems require global per- spectives and international cooperation, both of which are developing, albeit at a snail's pace. Holistic analysis of environmental problems involves inquiry into all areas that contribute to environmental problems. In the previous section, we briefly explored three of these areas: social costs, entitle- ments, and economic measurement. Two of the many additional prob- lem areas that have not been addressed in this article are the economic growth culture and directed systems technologies. The growth culture thrives on inertia and cheap resources. If we are lucky, an alternative will evolve before harmful effects of the sociosystem wash out all viable ecosystem development paths. We too seldom ask the questions, "Pro- duction for What?" and "Production for Whom?" Directed systems technologies are developed to alleviate the effects of harmful environmental feedbacks or to alter systems flows and inter- actions. Such technologies are developed neither by households nor by firms so long as thev can use the environment as a free or cheap dump. Partly because the environmental sinks have always been cheap, and partly because the approach of Western science has been reductionist, these technologies are in their infancy, but their expansion offers con- siderable hope for reducing the tradeoffs and negative feedbacks among the four functions of the environment.</page><page sequence="34">1772 James A. Swaney While the focus of this article has been theoretical, a few specific pol- icy directions have been suggested or implied. Clearly, resource use that threatens environmental compatibility should be discouraged. Natural resource flows that degrade the environment directly or lead to serious waste problems should be taxed or prohibited. Any activity that inter- feres with natural goods production or threatens the life-support system should be discouraged. A coevolutionary user tax on fossil fuels pro- vides one example. New accounting techniques will be necessary to pre- vent further cost shifting and to hold perpetrators accountable. The entitlements structure will also have to continue to evolve away from the right to pollute toward the right to a safe, sustainable environment. If we are to avoid the pessimistic prognostications of K. William Kapp and Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, thoughtful people on the na- tional, regional, and global levels will have to work harder to identify problems, develop technologies, promote education and the land ethic, and facilitate redistribution of income and wealth.

See also the DeGregori-Gowdy exchange cited above. Ranson, Brinkman, and DeGregori appear to believe either (a) that the human animal is not powerful enough to alter or upset life support systems; or (b) that technology will always be there in time to mitigate adverse consequences or reverse a trend before the life support system is significantly damaged. I find neither position tenable. The first has been demonstrated to be false by many authors and by entire civili- zations. The second is extremely naive. In addition to the threat of ther- monuclear war, our ignorance of the myriad links in the long, complex chains of ecological cause and effect render this position incredible. Symptoms of problems may become apparent only after considerable momentum has been established. It is not unlikely that significant global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion are already irreversibly es- tablished trends for which "technological solutions" will be, at best, patchwork damage control. Some have compared environmental prob-, lems to putting a man on the moon, suggesting that if we applied the brains and hardware of the space program to the environment, environ- mental problems could be solved too. The knowledge required to put a man on the moon, while considerable, involved clear objectives and well- known, relatively simple chains of causation. Compared to acquiring sufficient knowledge of evolving ecosystems and their interactions, the moon shot was a proverbial "piece of cake." We can only hope we are as far along toward resolving ecological systems problems as Copernicus was in solving moon shot problems! See Larry E.

While beyond the scope of this article, it is worthwhile to note Kapp's intellectual debt (which he recognizes) to both Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen. Also notable is the similarity of Kapp's analysis to Polanyi's "double movement," where the spread of the market was accompanied by a widespread, spontaneous social protective reaction to the social costs of the market. See Polanyi, The Great Transformation, particularly Chap- ter 1 1. 67. Of course if information is perfect and there is no involuntary unemploy- ment, substandard health and safety conditions would cause workers to demand a higher wage to compensate for the higher-risk jobs. Such lines of reasoning prove only two things: perfect competition is by definition perfect; and perfect competition is a pure fiction. 68. K. William Kapp, "Environment and Technology: New Frontiers for the Social and Natural Sciences," Journal of Economic Issues 11 (September 1977): 532-533. 69. The long-term tendency of a competitive system to erode moral standards has been a theme of many writers, probably beginning with Karl Marx. For discussion of this topic, see Albert 0.

Cost-shifting (as opposed to "society-improving" or "life-process- enhancing") technical change is analogous to, but different from, "cere- monial encapsulation," at least as that term is defined by Paul D. Bush. Ceremonial encapsulation impedes the instrumental use of new knowl- edge, where cost-shifting implements (and by implication develops) knowledge for the purpose of avoiding accounting costs. Louis Junker's work on food and nutrition seems to me better understood in the con- text of cost-shifting, although his parallel development of ceremonial encapsulation may suggest a meaning somewhat at variance with Bush's definition.

Bush, "An Exploration of the Structural Char- acteristics of a Veblen-Ayres-Foster Defined Institutional Domain," Journal of Economic Issues 17 (March 1983): 35-66; and Swaney, "A Co- evolutionary Model of Structural Change." 71.

In my "A Coevolutionary Model of Structural Change," I offered a simple model of interdependent but separate sociosystem and ecosystem devel- opment paths and suggested that the growing power of modem technol- ogy posed an increasing threat to ecosystem sustainability via the damaging feedbacks from modem social systems. I offered the possibility that change that appears to be progressive (or instrumental or contribut- ing to the life process) could in fact threaten ecosystem development along a path that would not be disruptive to further sociosystem devel- opment. I called such a change "instrumental degenerative," because the appearance of technological progress in the sociosystem context of the Veblenian instrumental-ceremonial dichotomy could degrade or weaken ecosystem evolutionary potential. The response from the discussant, Paul D. Bush, whose sociosystem model I had employed, was that I had mis- used the dichotomy. He still maintains that position.
