         <italic>Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved</italic> contains the primatologist Frans de Waal’s 2003 Tanner Lectures; comments on these lectures by evolutionary psychologist Robert Wright and philosophers Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher, and Peter Singer; and de Waal’s responses to their comments. As the subtitle suggests, de Waal’s lectures concern the role of biological evolution in the development of our capacity for moral thought and action. One’s level of interest in de Waal’s treatment of this topic will probably depend largely on how surprising one finds reports such as what follows: “Rhesus monkeys refuse to pull a chain that delivers food to themselves if doing so shocks a companion. One monkey stopped pulling for five days, and another one for twelve days after witnessing shock delivery to a companion. These monkeys were literally starving themselves to avoid inflicting pain upon another” (29).</p>
      <p>The ideal reader of this book is someone who finds it very hard to believe that a nonhuman animal would do such a thing, on the grounds that (<italic>a</italic>) nonhuman animal behavior is entirely determined by natural selection and natural selection selects only for selfish behavior and (<italic>b</italic>) the human capacity for selfless behavior does not rest upon, but rather stands in opposition to, our evolutionary origins. When in conversation with such a reader, de Waal’s discussion is at its strongest; one cannot read this book and remain wedded to thinking that nonhuman animals are selfish brutes or that there’s something unnatural about helping others (even when it comes at a cost to oneself). It is at its weakest, however, when it comes to giving clear articulation to an alternative way of thinking about the role of biological evolution in the development of our capacity for moral thought and action. For instance, de Waal repeatedly emphasizes that he thinks that our capacity for moral thought and action is continuous with capacities possessed by closely related species, but his discussion of what this capacity consists in, as well as his discussion of what it means for it to be continuous with capacities possessed by other species, remains frustratingly imprecise. De Waal appears to assume that merely rejecting <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> suffices to identify an alternative way of thinking about morality and that only a commitment to something like <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> stands in the way of understanding what morality is, where it comes from, and its significance. But these are deeper and more multifaceted matters than de Waal’s discussion acknowledges, and the philosophical import of his justly renowned studies of animal behavior would come through more clearly if more effort was expended on specifying exactly which aspects of these questions he is attempting to address, and which not. For example, one gets the overriding sense that de Waal thinks that his reports of nonhuman animals helping one another and expecting similar rewards for performing similar tasks suffice to justify thinking that we should be altruistic and that we should treat one another fairly, but it is far from obvious how those sorts of conclusions about the justifiability of certain moral norms follow merely from observations of how nonhuman animals tend to behave.</p>
      <p>The two main topics that de Waal’s discussion of the evolution of morality centers around are his criticisms of a view he calls “Veneer Theory” (VT) and his defense of the use of anthropomorphic language in describing the behavior of primates. I will begin by summarizing these two topics separately, before discussing why de Waal thinks that they are closely related.</p>
      <p>De Waal characterizes VT as the view that people are “essentially evil and selfish” (52) and that morality is a “sham” (21), a mere “cultural overlay” (6) that “go[es] against our own nature” (55), implying that “if people think they are at times unselfish, [it is because] they must be hiding their true motives from themselves” (11). On the face of it, VT is not a very plausible view, and one immediately wonders why de Waal makes it a centerpiece of his discussion. In their comments, Korsgaard goes as far as calling VT “rather silly” (103) and Kitcher argues that the ease with which VT is demolished suggests that it does not identify any real issues at stake in a serious discussion of the role of biological evolution in the development of our capacity for moral thought and action. Although I share Korsgaard’s and Kitcher’s sentiments in this regard, I think it must be acknowledged that VT has found its fair share of advocates within sociobiology and evolutionary psychology over the past thirty years. For example, David P. Barash is not alone in having argued that, as he once put it, “Real, honest‐to‐God altruism simply doesn’t occur in nature” (<italic>The Whisperings Within</italic> [London: Penguin, 1980], 135). There is a persistent tendency, among both proponents and opponents of the use of evolutionary theory to illuminate human nature, to think that biological evolution can only produce selfish behavior. That there is this tendency and that it finds expression in views such as VT, more than suffices to warrant de Waal’s interest in a view that is, on the surface, a rather silly manifestation of yet another form of psychological egoism. What remains frustrating about de Waal’s discussion of VT, however, is that he often uses the phrase in a much less precise sense than that outlined above. For instance, he argues that social contract theory is committed to VT and claims that John Rawls accepted a “milder version” (4) of it. But I seriously doubt that Rawls accepted any version of the commitments of VT outlined above, and de Waal does not offer a more encompassing formulation of VT, one that plausibly lumps together Rawls’s justificatory project and the debunking project that de Waal associates with VT. My own best guess at what motivates de Waal’s more encompassing use of VT is an implicit commitment on his part to a distinction between ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ aspects of human life, where the natural aspects are all and only those that are fully explicable in terms of biological evolution. Having assumed such an understanding of the natural/artificial distinction, de Waal inevitably interprets anyone who argues that morality is not fully explicable in terms of biological evolution as committed to thinking that morality is an artificial veneer, one that is not really part of human nature. This assumption leads de Waal both to ignore the possibility that ‘human nature’ might not be a strictly biological concept and to overstate the number of thinkers who hold that morality is an artificial veneer.</p>
      <p>De Waal’s own writings are saturated with the use of anthropomorphic language to describe the behavior of primates, and in these lectures he attempts to provide an argument for this practice. Here is his argument, in outline:</p>
      <p>
         <sc>Premise 1</sc>. Humans and primates engage in similar behavior.</p>
      <p>
         <sc>Premise 2</sc>. “If closely related species act the same, the underlying mental processes are probably the same” (62).</p>
      <p>
         <sc>Conclusion</sc>. We are justified in using the same anthropomorphic language to describe primate behavior that we would use to describe similar behavior in humans.</p>
      <p>Once again, de Waal’s discussion is at its strongest when it is in conversation with someone who holds a rather extreme view: in this case, the view in question—de Waal calls it “anthropodenial” (65)—is a kind of behaviorism which holds that mentalistic descriptions are never appropriate with regard to nonhuman animals. In conversation with someone who holds a more nuanced view, however, de Waal’s imprecise use of relevant concepts once again frustrates serious engagement. For instance, many have thought that describing an agent’s actions in moral terms presupposes that the agent is capable of normative self‐governance. If this is right, then a mere similarity in behavior does not, in itself, imply a similarity in action—at least with regard to moral action. But de Waal’s discussion neglects this qualification altogether, preferring instead to treat ‘selfless’ and ‘altruistic’ as interchangeable concepts. An adequate defense of de Waal’s own practice of describing nonhuman animal behavior in moral terms, therefore, requires addressing this issue head‐on and being much more careful about the exact similarities and differences between primate and human actions.</p>
      <p>De Waal thinks that rejecting VT and rejecting anthropodenial are related, because he holds that taken together these rejections imply that “all of human morality is continuous with primate sociality” (167). My own sense, however, is that although de Waal’s criticisms of the rather extreme views he rejects are compelling, they are insufficient, in themselves, to articulate an alternative view. An additional problem is that de Waal appears to share with his opponents a rather limited sense of the alternatives: either morality is fully explicable in terms of biological evolution or biology has nothing to do with it. Anyone who thinks that these are not all of the alternatives will find de Waal’s discussion frustrating in this regard.</p>
      <p>In short, <italic>Primates and Philosophers</italic> is valuable in several respects. It contains persuasive arguments against a pair of views that have found prominent advocates outside of philosophy. One can only hope that de Waal’s book lays these views to rest once and for all. It also contains a number of suggestive reports of nonhuman animals helping one another and expecting similar rewards for performing similar tasks. De Waal is right to hold that these reports are relevant to understanding the evolutionary origins of morality, but he has not yet succeeded in articulating the precise sense in which they are relevant. Indeed, the false dichotomies with which he works may positively obscure some of the most difficult questions concerning evolution and morality.</p>
