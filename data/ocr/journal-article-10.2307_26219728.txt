<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGION OF THE MODERNS: FREEDOM AND AUTHENTICITY IN CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION Alan Pitt1 Abstract: This article analyses Constant's largest work — De la Religion — in an attempt to clarify the ethical foundations of his political thought. The book presents his most fully developed ideas on history and society. A number of themes are discussed: Constant's theism; his belief in the growing authenticity of religious belief as a driving force in human history; the important role played by Rousseau's thought in his under standing of liberty. A study of Delà Religion (it is argued) reveals that his enthusiasm for commercial society was in no sense that of a simple individualist. ... the religious sentiment is an emotion of the same type as all our natural emotions; it is always in agreement, in consequence, with sympathy, pity, and justice; in a word, with all the virtues.2 This short phrase from De la Religion conveys one of the most important motifs of Benjamin Constant's ethics, the unity and compatibility of all pos sible goods in 'feeling'. It comes from Constant's longest and most closely meditated work, in which he presented a world history of religion from its ori gins in shamanism to its culmination in Christianity. The five-volume study is most famous for its anti-clerical polemics, its denunciation of the evils of the 'sacerdotal' religions of history, but this article will consider a distinct theme presented in the text and in its posthumous sequel, Du Polythéisme Romain, namely the contrast between feeling and interest as the basis of religious creeds, and the impact that both divergent forms of human motivation have upon the nature of societies. De la Religion deserves more attention as a source for the clarification of some of the ethical foundations of Constant's thought, and it is beginning to receive it.

A theme picked up again in the Principes de la Politique — 'There is in emotion, whatever its cause, something which makes our blood flow faster, which communicates to us a kind of well-being which doubles the sense of our existence and our powers, and that by doing so, renders us capable of a greater generosity, courage, or sympathy, than we normally feel. Even a corrupt man is better when he is moved and as long as he is moved', in Benjamin Constant, Political Writings, ed. Biancamaria Fontana (Cambridge, 1988), p. 278. Here his particular target is the intolerance towards non-jurors to the civil religion that Rousseau advocated as an essential provision for political unity in Du Contrat Social. Constant argues instead for the essential utility of all possible religious practices: but only in a free state. HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT. Vol. XXI. No. 1.

PITT ideas into an analysis of his politics.3 This article, it is hoped, will complement his work with a discussion of the key ideas of feeling and interest in Constant's work in this and other fields. A classically individualist insight, deeply suggestive of the immense importance of a reading of Rousseau to his work, dominates De la Religion: religion, a healthy and pure emotion as experienced by the free individual, has persistently been corrupted in history in the process of becoming institutional ized, becoming the possession of closed and calculating groups. Constant was aware that some of the implications of this, his primary thesis, sounded paradoxical: What if... I were to propose the following question to my readers: there are two sorts of religion; the first is the end-product of the conjectures, the fears and hopes of an ignorant multitude, abandoned to all the errors into which its ignorance drives it; the other is the slowly meditated work of the elite of the human race formed into corporations, bringing together all the knowl edge that they have managed to conquer by unrelenting labours, through profound reflection, the discoveries of science, the subtleties of meta physics, and the refinements of contemplation. In which of these two reli gions would the character of the gods be most pure, the most sublime, the most free of all imperfection and vice? Of course, one's preference would go to the second; yet nonetheless, when we question history we shall see the facts compete to dispel such a preference.4 This study will attempt to draw out some of the implications of Constant's assertion for his social and moral theory. It will adopt the following order of enquiry. Starting with a discussion of Constant's own somewhat unclear reli gious beliefs, it will proceed to a consideration of how, he thought, priests impeded progress in religious feeling. The article will then proceed to a more precise definition of what religious feeling, paradigm of all feeling, means for Constant, and how he considers it to serve as guarantor of all possible social goods. Such a discussion will bring us to the heart of Constant's political psychol ogy. Five major points will be argued: 1. That Constant was consistently a theist. 2. That while toleration was an important good in his work, it was in no sense the primary ideal of his views on religious arrangements. 3. That the extent to which the flow of feeling is free, and therefore the degree of honesty prevailing in a society, was his most important cri terion in judging the value of social organizations. 4. Overpowerful priests are primarily undesirable because they inter fere with the spontaneous flow of feeling — not individual liberty in the wider sense. 3 Tzvetan Todorov, Benjamin Constant: la passion démocratique (Paris, 1997). 4 Constant, De la religion, IV, pp. 19-20.</page><page sequence="3">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 69 5. That his ultimate understanding of liberty owes far more to an ideal of autonomy in the tradition of Rousseau than to any celebration of individual rights per se. Constant and the Rediscovery of Theism An essential preliminary is an investigation of Constant's own beliefs, with the aid of some contextual background. The years of the First French Empire and the Restoration saw a proliferation of new and imaginative work on reli gion. Chateaubriand's Génie du Christianisme was the most successful text of what amounted to a genuine literary movement, but it included scholarly works such as a translation of Creuzer's Religions de l'antiquité. A number of historical factors gave the movement particular creativity in France.The trau mas of de-Christianization at the height of the Terror had unleashed proletar ian anti-clericalism in an unprecedented way. The experimental introduction of a series of official, theistic cults,5 and the considerable impoverishment of the Catholic Church in France during the Revolution6 had cleared the ground for a great independence of approach which animated the whole range of 'new' religious perspectives on offer in France in these years. These ranged from the leisured sensualism of Chateaubriand's writings on the beauties of Catholicism, to the technological utopianism of Saint-Simon's proposals for a new Church. Writers on all sides were eager to distance themselves both from the degeneracy of the ancien régime, the irresponsibility of the dilettante spirit of the enlightened nobility, and the perceived godlessness of the Revo lution. Almost all agreed not only about the inadequacies of a materialist athe ism, but about the failings of rationalist deism. The revival of interest in the idea of a personal god, a far more traditional entity than the deity of mere Enlightenment deism, was nearly universal in the published writings on reli gion from this period. Constant was no exception. In De la Religion he hoped to enrich conjec tural history in the tradition of Hume with a mass of genuine erudition, incor porating the new discoveries of the German philologists on the religions of the Orient, but injecting a renewed moral sense, approaching an essentially anthropological account of religion with a new sense of reverence. Pure expository philosophy is absent from the book, barring a few preliminary chapters on the nature of the religious sentiment. The rest is presented as pure history. Constant's attempt to combine reverence with historical objectivity can be frustrating for the historian: while he is full of praise for the benefits of the religious sentiment, he skirts frank discussion of the question of objective religious truth, even of the existence of God, without any clear statement of 5 Notably the Cult of the Supreme Being associated with Robespierre, and the Theophilanthropy of the Directory. 6 An impoverishment (particularly of personnel) that was not made good until the second half of the century.</page><page sequence="4">70 A. PITT his personal beliefs in the matter. A number of studies have been devoted to clarifying the exact status of Constant's religious belief: some in the 'death bed conversion' mould claiming he became a full-blown Christian in later life, some more convincingly portraying Constant as a lifelong agnostic who tended towards a more committed pietism at times of personal crisis.7 In any case, Constant seems to have deliberately maintained a certain obscurity when it came to direct comment on theology: There is certainly something vague in the first chapter on the religious senti ment, but this vagueness is inevitable. In a sense, it is even there in my opin ions, and even if it were not, I would not mind it being there in my style, concerning that sentimental and melancholy aspect of religion against which I do not wish to declare myself.8 The book presents religion as the development of a spiritual idea through his tory, and therefore explicitly excludes any discussion of timeless religious truth. It is plain, however, that there was an ideal religious 'minimum' in which he saw at least a temporary fulfdment to the march of the religious senti ment in history: a minimum most closely approximated in the United States, where 'often a single family is divided into several sects, without such a diver gence troubling peace and domestic affection, because the members are united in their adoration of a just and benevolent providence'.9 Furthermore, the cumulative internal evidence of De la Religion and Du Polythéisme Romain10 points very strongly to a coherent unspoken belief that can be swiftly defined. John Burrow has discussed some of the logical problems raised by evolutionary theories as an attempt to cover strong personal convic tion with a patina of objectivity. Employing the language of a historically minded relativism, evolutionist social thinkers nonetheless invariably present their beliefs in a scantily disguised form, by projecting them onto a highly idealized future-state, the end of history. An appeal to the direction of history as a means of confirming the validity of a future ideal takes the place of explicit conviction in many mainstream political and sociological texts in the 7 Helen H.S. Hogue, Of Changes in Benjamin Constant's Books on Religion (Geneva, 1964), is scholarly, but depends on bizarre symbolic interpretations in its story of his progress from militant atheism to Christianity; Henri Gouhier, Benjamin Constant (Paris, 1967, Les écrivains devant Dieu), presents Constant as an 'anxious agnostic', pp. 39-40. This thesis is most convincingly presented in the superb Constant méconnu, le livre De la religion avec des documents inédits (Geneva, 1969), of Pierre Déguisé. 8 Déguisé, Constant méconnu, 55. 9 Constant, 'Du développement progressif des idées religieuses', Mélanges de littérature et de politique (Paris, 1829), p. 126. 10 The title is seriously misleading. Planned as a conclusion to De la religion, this posthumous and editorially inferior work concerns both the transition to theism via Greek philosophy, critical to the argument of, yet left aside in, De la religion·, it is only thereafter concerned directly with Roman manners and the final collapse of polytheism. The comparison of theism and polytheism is far more explicit here than in the prior work.</page><page sequence="5">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 71 nineteenth century.11 Much as the ostensibly scientific evolutionism of a Spencer or a Durkheim served as a poor mask for highly normative concep tions of the goal of historical change, the same underlying conviction is evi dent here in Constant's most systematic work on the development of ideas, the same desire to give belief historical objectivity through a discourse of pro gress. Constant does hesitate to predict any future religious settlement in detail;12 but the work is soaked with more or less unwitting guidelines as to his beliefs. The simple question — what kinds of dogma impede religious progress for Constant? — gives us a clear idea, at least, of those beliefs that he despised. First, of course, an excess of priestly power constantly opposes, through their artificial manipulation of dogma, what should be the natural pro cess of progressive perfection. More fundamentally, however, throughout the panoramic sweep of the history, 'tout ce qui va au coeur' in religious belief is inevitably positive, and what appeals to the head, negative. His discussion of Plato and Aristotle is revealing here. Plato's God is admired for his ability to answer all the needs of the human heart — he is free, sympathetic and provi dential — whereas Aristotle's God is an abstraction, the substance of sub stances, and is derided as such.13 These and other discussions reveal a rudimentary creed behind the observa tions of the book's author: God exists; God is a personality in the widest sense; God is at least theoretically capable of special acts of Providence; God is thoroughly fitted to the needs of human sentiment; and only the free man can have full access to Him. Christ's position, except as a historical factor in the spread of a distinct doctrine at a given moment in Roman history, is rather nerinheral in this underlvins creed.14 Constant's writings took on a more orthodox tone in his later years. His periodical fascination with pietism reveals that behind the mask of agnosti cism the rudiments of a broadly Christian faith were there consistently in his later life. This is not to suggest that there was any deliberate self-deception on Constant's part when he protested his agnosticism, but that his doubts none theless bore the deep imprint of a very specific faith. His contempt for the non-theistic religions of the Orient, in particular,15 are revealing of the limits of his capacity to doubt. 11 J.W.

PITT An Evolving Ideal: From Toleration to Faith Constant set out, in the 1780s, to write a historically minded defence of tolera tion. Some have seen the final text in just such a light,16 but it is a primary con tention of this article that (contrary to what one might expect from a writer so widely celebrated as an exponent of modem freedom above all else) such an ideal has a small part to play in the work as it was published. It defends tolera tion and religious pluralism obliquely, but only as side-products of the ideal of his mature years, the emotional authenticity that an over-powerful Church sup posedly impedes. In the intervening period, the work had become a study of the religious experience itself, and Constant now gave religion itself,17 not freedom of religion, centre stage as the crowning achievement of centuries of civilization. The transformation was symptomatic not only of a thorough rethinking of history, but of a fundamental feature of Constant's political values. The Enlightenment genre of the sociology of religion, exemplifed in the works of Gibbon and Hume on the religion of the ancients, was an ambiguous one for Constant. He claimed to have been under the spell of Helvétius when he set about the initial project of the book as early as the mid-1780s,18 with the inten tion of proving that the theism of the modern era was inferior to the paganism of the ancients by virtue of its poor record on toleration. This, by now, was the consensus judgment of the radical Enlightenment, taking its stance essentially from the study of the social consequences of different types of belief. Such a conclusion is altogether absent from the final text of Constant's work, which makes any easy identification of Constant's views on the subject with the approach of Hume or Helvétius, or of Gibbon, impossible. That polytheism admitted more tolerance for a wide range of 'truths' is accepted by Constant: but, as we shall see, his own feelings about religion ultimately depended upon the conviction that there was, finally, an absolute truth, albeit one that may not yet have emerged fully in the historical process. By the time the book was finally published, the relativist implications of the consequentialist approach to social questions that typified the work of Hume was, to Constant, gravely suspect.19 The final text is built, instead, around two theoretical pillars that played no part in the earlier, Helvétius-inspired, drafts: one is the important distinction 16 An interpretation put forward by Biancamaria Fontana, Benjamin Constant and the post-revolutionary mind (New Haven, 1991), pp. 109-11. 17 Sometimes, indeed, Christianity. 18 Benjamin Constant, Journal intime (Monaco, 1945), p. 10. 19 See below, pp. 83^1.</page><page sequence="7">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 73 between 'sacerdotal' and 'independent' religions.20 The development of this distinction through the various drafts of the book has been closely traced by Hogue, who finds that it emerged most clearly in the manuscript of 1803-6, by which time the classic Enlightenment approval of polytheism's intrinsic ten dency to toleration is altogether absent in the text. By the time ot the publication ot De la Religion, indeed, the hnhghtenment case is decisively rejected. Pagan tolerance was founded not on any 'respect for the individual's belief (here of course continuing Constant's lifelong cri tique of the supposed liberties of antiquity), since the native citizens of the ancient cities had no right to adopt another religion. The supposed 'advan tages' of paganism thus extended merely to the foreign and the disenfran chised, while domestic dissenters like Socrates were as suspect to their peers as the heretics of the modern period. Modern toleration, founded upon the superior ethical basis of Christian egalitarianism, had a basis not in indiffer ence, as for the ancients, but in a far more profound sense of human dignity. It was Christian monotheism that had reallv cleared the eround for toleration.21 The Roman priest may have been more tolerant; but with a moribund faith and a cynical soul he could afford to be. Christianity was intrinsically superior to paganism in terms of pure morality.22 As men start to believe anew, so they 20 The second pillar of the book's theoretical structure is an extended discussion of the historical dialectic created by the tensions between the ever-evolving sentiment religieux and the outer expressions that that sentiment, operating freely, establishes for itself in its progressive purification, the formes religieuses. This theme emerged at the time of Constant's pietist period in 1808-9 and would dominate the final text. The next manuscript of 1811-13, 'De la religion, depuis sa forme plus grossière jusqu'à la plus épurée', was saturated with a secularized version of the thesis of 'progressive revelation' that he seems initially to have derived from the liberal German theologians, and which surely marked his theory of progress (Deguise, Constant méconnu, pp. 158-65). He did not portray God as the direct agent of progress in revelation, eking out enlightenment according to the developing maturity of man, his creation. Later, it is true, he seemed to take such a thesis of progressive revelation from above more literally, citing Galatians, IV, 1-4 : 'Now I say, as long as the heir is a child he differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all;/ But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:/ So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world./ But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law . . . ', 'Des causes humaines qui ont concurru à l'établissement du Christianisme', Mélanges, p. 384. In the text, however, he makes the less dogmatic claim that human understanding develops, bringing a refinement of religious views. 21 Constant, 'Des causes humaines', Mélange s, p. 359. 22 Constant, Polythéisme romain, II, p. 244: 'People have tried to deny the spirit of freedom amongst the first Christians. They have used a few isolated expressions, that necessity forced out of circumstances, in order to contest what shines, almost from every word, of our holy books ... How, with their pure morality, their deep conviction, their inner force, their high-minded enthusiasm, their contempt for death, how could the Christians not have nursed a violent and open outrage against that tyranny which weighed upon the universe?'</page><page sequence="8">74 A. PITT learn the importance of the struggle of ideas again.23 Toleration, per se, is important, but is an inadequate substitute for the inherent moral advantages of faith. Constant's belief in the benefits of religious diversity cannot be doubted: but there is a deeper underlying value here, deeper even than liberty in the narrow sense, the ideal of authenticity in emotions and actions. Constant's change of heart on this point could not be more complete and explicit. What Priests do to Beliefs Enlightenment authors since Voltaire had identified the self-interest of priestly corporations as the chief moral obstacle to a true, beneficent, religion. The priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church was singled out for special criti cism, of course. Constant — at first sight — seems to adopt the same familiar perspective, celebrating religious freedom as a basic social good and decrying the meddlesome influence of priestly corporations. To an extent Constant belongs to the same individualist tradition: however, Constant's argument is distinct in its emphasis on the intellectualism of priests (at least as much as their greed) as the decisive factor that undermines true religion in society at large. This distinct emphasis will help clarify the underlying characteristics of Constant's liberalism. Let us briefly recount Constant's history of religion. The beliefs of a given society, when that society is not subjected to authoritarian controls to the progress of ideas, invariably purify themselves. Constant's faith in the inevi tability of purification in ideas belongs to the materialism of the idéologue school: ideas, which initially are inevitably crude and ill-sorted as representa tions of sense experience, inevitably come to match reality better over the cen turies, primarily owing to trial and error on the part of successive generations. Generation after generation reflects further upon the same sense data, and ideas come to resemble the reality of the world more closely. Progress is therefore all but inevitable in human life.24 Representations of the gods, likewise, naturally become purer. They have developed according to the following chronology: vague animal and nature gods, scarcely connected amongst themselves, give way to increasingly anthropomorphic gods, united into a distinct society as were the Olympians, possessing good and bad human moral qualities;25 eventually, these humanoid gods become more thoroughly moral, and come to be seen as governing the universe in an essentially benevolent and disinterested way; and finally, the last stage of the process experienced in antiquity, they come to be regarded as 23 Constant, ibid., p. 256. 24 Compare the theoretical account of the inevitability of progress in ideas in (Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat) Condorcet, Esquisse d'un tableau des progrès de l'esprit humain (Paris, 1971 ), pp. 75-6; and the parallel argument in Constant, Mélanges, p. 387. 25 Constant, De la religion, I, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="9">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 75 purely spiritual entities.26 Had the priests of Rome not interfered with the next stage in the process, these spiritual entities would have fused into the modern God. How do priesthoods come to dominate this inevitable process? The priestly class emerges with an early division of labour in those societies whose sur vival depends upon a close study of astronomical or meteorological condi tions. Thus more developed forms of priesthood emerge from shamanism and develop a distinct class consciousness founded upon a monopoly of scientific knowledge.27 The imagined boundaries of inequality are given a more funda mental psychological rigidity by this monopoly of expertise.28 Such an inequality of knowledge brings with it a severe social disutility as the priest hood, as a class, takes responsibility for religious feeling upon itself, which is inevitably corrupted thereafter by its distinct corporate motives. After monotheism, the second important historical moment is the arrival of a refined ideal of sacrifice. Indeed, it is the drift towards monotheism, coupled with this much more subtle psychological conception of sacrifice, the 'mak ing sacred' of the heart, that is the crowning achievement of Greek freedom at its highest point — the religious sentiment of a Sophocles or a Pindar, so close for Constant to the supreme psychology and morality of Christianity.29 The Greeks' achievement is discussed in Constant's description of this crucial intellectual moment. The sketch of primitive religion in Volume One presents the practice of sacrifice as a mixture of motives in its earliest stages; some of pure adoration, some of self-interested calculation. The form, however, is unstable, because there is no particularly entrenched form of authority. An embryonic priesthood existed in the shamans (Jongleurs), who show some of the typical traits of later priests — for example the tendency to elaborate irk some sacrifices for the uninitiated in order to secure their own social ascendency.30 They have nothing approaching the power of the great institu tional sway of the later mature polytheistic priesthoods, Egyptian and Brah min, the stultifying castes apart par excellence. Sacrifice for the savage and for the great institutionalized polytheisms of India and Egypt shows some influence of the 'pure' religious sentiment of adoration, but has a relatively gross selfish quality: a quid pro quo with the fetish or the god. Left to his native freedom, as were the Greeks, the polytheist comes in due course to per ceive the inadequacy of such a crude materialism. The gods, once this insight is attained, no longer are held to have material needs: and it is now that the most critical divergence of the independent and the priestly religions take place. The good religious sentimentalist, premature Protestant that he was for 26 Benjamin Constant, Polythéisme romain, I, pp. 111-12. 27 Constant, De la religion, II, pp. 29-30. 28 Ibid., II, pp. 61-3. 29 Ibid., pp. 375-9 and following chapters. 30 Ibid., I, pp. 234-6.</page><page sequence="10">76 A. PITT Constant, recognizes that sacrifice, if it is to retain its meaning, must mean an inner surrendering of the spirit, a change of heart. The priests, however, take a quite contrary course — if the gods no longer want goods, then they must have pain.M Their domination had previously depended on an exaggerated multi plication of the gods' physical demands, but now comes to depend upon prac tices that are more directly destructive of natural human feeling and therefore of society itself. Human sacrifices commence at this point; the most extreme ascetic practices develop; the licentious rites of Cybele and Kali, another invasion of the physical person, begin too: Krishna, in Constant's mind a human reformer of indecent rites, was turned by Brahminical interest into the centre of an essentially sexual cult, offensive against modesty if not against the body. Buddha's teachings against the iniquities of the caste system were likewise misappropriated by the priesthood and transformed into instruments of domination.32 At a moment when materialism should have yielded to a richer, sentimental and internal devotion, the priests stopped short of acknowledging this new conception of inner surrender, and instead adopted a half-baked improvement on the primitive notion of sacrifice as bargain. Pain rather than adoration took the place of the physical gift to the gods. The Greeks alone avoided this error: their new insight into the gods' contempt for the sacrifice of crude material goods was never used as a pretext for austerities and scourgings (the practices of the mystery cults were ascribed by Constant to a fundamentally alien priestly element derived from the wider Mediterranean context).33 Again, it should be noted that Constant's appraisal of the superiority of Greek beliefs on this point does not involve any admiration for their ability to yield tolera tion·, he is not interested in formal freedom per se, only in freedom because it permits the development of a higher form of feeling, a greater authenticity of religious sentiment. It is purely the subjective character of Greek thought as a living religious experience that interests Constant as a stepping stone to an ethos that is increasingly untainted by any crude basis in self-interest, i.e. the direct and fundamentally sentimental relationship with the Protestant God. Only the free, those undeluded by a priesthood, can reach such a point of development, attain a richer spiritual sense that owes nothing at all to self-interest, arising entirely from religious adoration. We have seen how a new accent on subjectivity, on the sincerity with which religious belief is held, marked out Constant from his Enlightenment fore bears. I will argue that freedom is subordinate to authenticity in Constant's work generally. In order to understand his outlook here, we need to under stand exactly why priests are so harmful to social development; and in order to 31 Ibid., IV, pp. 202-5. 32 Ibid., pp. 247-81. 33 Ibid., p. 281, and on the mysteries, V, Book xiii.</page><page sequence="11">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 77 follow his argument, we need in particular a more detailed discussion of the meaning of 'feeling' in Constant's work, both on religion and more generally. Two Kinds of Feeling: Honesty and Manipulation The authenticity of the subjective sentiment before God must replace the cal culating materialism of the sacrifice: but certain distinctions need to be borne in mind in the consideration of Constant's view of emotion. He persistently drew an important distinction between certain types of emotions: the differ ence between what, for convenience here, could be described as primary and secondary emotions. The distinction is not explicit in Constant, yet it recurs repeatedly in his work. The former kind are marked by their intrinsic tendency to provoke honesty with others, for instance romantic love in its first flower ing, and religious adoration when it, like passionate love, is freely given. Sec ondary emotions — for instance, pity or the desire to shield another from a painful truth — are intrinsically dishonest, intrinsically liable to disturb the unity of all goods in spontaneous feeling as described above. Any form of manipulation brings chaos, even at its most benevolent: a point that can be illustrated with the story of Adolphe, whose dilemma evolves as follows. Love, a primary, natural emotion, has given place to a secondary sense of guilt and of pity in his feelings for Ellenore. When they no longer enjoy the spontaneous affection of the early stages of their relationship, with Adolphe no longer in the bloom of love following his mistress's separation from Comte de P_, calculation and manipulation (albeit of the most disinterested sort) take the place of direct communication. All their disasters follow from this point, this underlying dishonesty that undermines their ability to live together happily: The moment some secret exists between two loving hearts, the moment one of them can decide to conceal one single thought from the other, the spell is broken and the bliss destroyed. Anger, injustice, even wandering affections can be put right again, but dissimulation brings into love a foreign element which perverts and withers it even in its own eyes.34 Later, love inevitably evaporates altogether: We were living, so to speak, on a sort of memory of the heart, strong enough to make the thought of separation painful, but too weak for us to find satis faction in being together. [... ] I would have liked to give Ellenore tokens of my love that would have made her happy, and indeed I sometimes went back to the language of love, but these emotions and this language resem bled the pale and faded leaves which, like remains of funeral wreaths, grow listlessly on the branches of an uprooted tree.35 34 Benjamin Constant, Adolphe, trans. Leonard Tancock (Harmondsworth, 1964), pp. 73-4. 35 Ibid., p. 89.</page><page sequence="12">78 A. PITT Adolphe sacrifices authenticity to his concern for his mistress; but Ellenore herself is not deceived — 'You think what you feel is love, but it is only pity.'36 The same distinction, between the spontaneity of real love and the calcula tion of pity (albeit an altruistic impulse), emerges repeatedly with regard to the other 'natural sentiment' par excellence, religion. Like Adolphe's loss of spontaneity in his relations with Ellenore, the priests' motives in elaborating a public faith may be entirely benevolent: but, as soon as deception enters their actions and pronouncements, the multifarious benefits of feeling disappear. Constant was conversant with the idea that mythologies had been created by priesthoods as a symbolic means of conveying religious and ethical truths. Constant was so insistent on the need for absolute honesty in the communica tion of religious ideas, however, that even the distortion of reality through the conscious deployment of symbolism, with a view to conveying deep truths to lesser minds, was, he considered, tantamount to lying and just as injurious.37 His incidental references to aesthetics reveal a similar horror of any form of 'manipulation', or use of a good towards some end outside itself, here in the creative process: Euripides, like Voltaire, was perpetually grinding polemical axes in his drama; this may have useful results, but an art serving goals outside itself will never be sublime38 (recalling Kant's view of art as 'disinterested pleasure'). By fixing ideas (particularly ideas tor mass consumption), nowever well-meaning they may be, priests inevitably put a halt to their own natural progress — and this process of stopping has the gravest moral repercussions, causing disbelief for those outside their ranks, and a stale cynicism for those within. Constant produces various examples of the process whereby the untruth at the heart of the sacramental social act brings severe social conse quences. For instance, Baron d'Holbach was a supreme anomaly for Con stant: militant atheism was quite simply unnatural, and his case could be explained only as a product of the distorting effects of religious oppression on an individual example of a human nature that is naturally religious. Only an embittered man could have written the atheistic Système de la Nature: the spontaneous religiousness of his underlying nature had been distorted by the repressions and injustices of ancien régime society.39 This analysis of the example of d'Holbach was a consistent and specific application of the belief presented at length in De la Religion that incredulity (with all its evils) could emerge only where there is an attempt by a priestly caste to retard the march of 36 Ibid., p. 81. 37 Constant, De la religion, III, pp. 61-83. 38 Ibid., IV, pp. 442-7. 39 Benjamin Constant, Deux chapitres inédits de l'esprit des religions (Neuchâtel, 1970), p. 133; Constant, Political Writings, p. 280: 'The lengthy frenzy of an old man to close off any future before him; that inexplicable thirst for destruction, that blind and almost cruel hatred for a gentle and consoling idea .. .'.</page><page sequence="13">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 79 the religious sentiment. When priesthoods cling to bizarre and outmoded forms — for instance the vestiges of fetishism which, to Constant's mind, served as the basis of Egyptian exoteric religion — the gods look more and more contemptible to the ordinary man, particularly when a heightened moral sense enters the religious thought of those who are supposedly the recipients of the official faith. Bossuet, as a believer, could delight in Samuel's massacre of Agag; Voltaire, viewing the same legend with the developed moral sense that a century had given, saw it as the supreme absurdity of a frankly amoral Old Testament tradition.40 The Greeks' freedom from the anachronistic influence of priests meant that the same underlying process of moral purification could march parallel to outer religious reforms, and the results of such a mismatch — disbelief — were avoided. Hesiod was content with the self-interested gods of ancient tra dition, and the moral outrages perpetrated by the Homeric pantheon; Pindar, the end-product of five hundred years of moral improvement, credited the same gods as the source of all justice. Free of priests, the gods had changed: and with them all religious doctrines. Hades was no longer a place of torture at the gods' whim; it was closer to the Christian notion of a purgatory for definite objective sins.41 Meanwhile the Egyptian people under the tutelage of a priestly class with great institutional stability were confronted with a selection of fetishistic animal-gods and crude expiatory practices.42 Sophisticated observers in such a society were thus alienated from all religion by the evi dence of priestly self-interest: the same mismatch that explains the cynicism of d'Holbach. Sound religion is wholly natural; only the calculation of a minority can disturb it. Preoccupied with reeling, Constant had little sympathy tor the distinct rationalism of the Hindu tradition. Equally, Constant presented a somewhat bizarre misinterpretation of Mahayana Buddhism that embodies his anti-rationalist prejudice clearly. When confronted with the concepts of the 'void' and 'illusion', utterly alien of course to a Christian mind of this period, Constant interprets their exponents, the lamas of Tibet and the bonzes of China, as Holbachian cynics. His outline presents the following fundamental articles of Buddhist belief: all things resolve into pure matter, say the priests; all ideas of merit and blame, purity and sanctity are merely illusory; nothing matters to Constant's Buddhists but the brute underlying reality of their own sensuality and ambition.43 υ Constant, De la religion, IV, pp. 356-7.

PITT All religions are thus placed on a continuum between 'warm' theism and 'cold' atheism: no other form makes sense to Constant in such a scheme. Any one denying the one God must be doing so out of self-interest: without the feeling of Him we operate in a moral vacuum. Buddhism, as Constant sees it, contains an essential atheism which is entirely suited to a self-interested élite who value their worldly comforts too strongly, and are fully prepared to use their monopoly of knowledge to bolster their dominant position. The Bud dhists are an extreme example of the contrast between the inner and outer faces of belief in priestly societies. Constant here is not merely concerned with the outer corruption engendered by the deliberate imposition of igno rance on the masses; more originally, he writes at great length setting out the inner effects of belief on the priests themselves, the psychological effects of constantly proclaiming an official faith founded upon deception: When the human mind, in possession of its native liberty, reflects on infin ity, on eternity, on the relations between the visible and the invisible world, sentiment takes its equal place amongst the judges and participates in the decision. But the position of the priestly corporations of antiquity necessar ily smothered and destroyed the religious sentiment amongst themselves. Wherever there is calculation, ruse, self-interest as a motive, the plan to make of religion an instrument, to bend it to a goal outside itself, the reli gious sentiment at first withers, and then disappears.44 The spontaneous now ot the feelings depends upon a tundamental integ rity; in particular upon a habitual tendency to honesty. When they have lost this, priests suffer the same emotional inhibition we have found in the case of Adolphe and live on a meagre diet of fake feeling, the memories of a lost reli gious moment when the natural sentiment was given its due. Most obviously here, the exoteric forms proposed by priests assume an outmoded form, be it a gross and physically degrading asceticism or the worship of animal-gods. Yet, with deception, their inner religious ethos, their own spontaneity of feel ing, is also lost, and the corporation finds itself on a sad slope to demoralization, cynicism and, eventually, atheism. A priesthood capable of habitual and deliberate deception has lost its faculty for the 'primary' feelings; an arid logic takes their place and (for Constant at least) the only viable source of true religious inspiration is spent. Unaided logic brings atheism and pantheism: pantheism, Constant observes, might in some respects seem a natural conclu sion to draw from reflection upon the natural world, yet 'it is ... destructive of any distinction between the Creator and his creation; of all distributive justice 44 Ibid., p. 21 (my emphasis). 'Quand l'esprit humain, en possession de sa liberté native, réfléchit sur l'infini, sur l'éternité, sur les relations du monde invisible avec le monde matériel, le sentiment prend place au rang des juges et participe à la décision. Mais la position des corporations sacerdotales de l'antiquité devait étouffer et détruire en elles le sentiment religieux. Partout où il y a calcul, ruse, intention intéressée, projet de faire de la religion un instrument, de la plier à un but hors d'elle-même, le sentiment religieux se flétrit d'abord et disparaît ensuite.'</page><page sequence="15">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 81 and special protection from the one; of all moral merit and all effective prayer for the other: in a word of all that satisfies the religious sentiment' .45 Panthe ism was simply not a viable religion; it invariably finds its origin in the eso teric doctrines of a priesthood that, through deceit and calculation, has lost touch with the primary emotions. De la Religion is less an anti-clencal polemic than a moral history or humanity. While he does indeed criticize the place of priests in the history of religion at enormous length (and this is surely the extent of most readers' acquaintance with the work), we should not let this emphasis obscure the essentials that set Constant far apart from the shallow individualism of the Enlightenment with which such a view tends to associate him. History, according to De la Religion, is a dual process: a process of ever-growing free dom, accompanying ever-growing sincerity and purity of feeling. The evolu tion of religion is the basic cause of both developments: priests are not to be feared simply for their obscurantism, nor simply for their hunger for power, but rather for their tendency to wipe out natural, spontaneous feeling. On every page of De la Religion, Constant reiterates his distinct claim that any attempt to impede religious progress destroys feeling: whether by provoking incredulity in the multitude or by eroding the natural sentiments of the priestly minority. It is this — rather than a defence of toleration, or any crude anti-corporate individualism — that is the book's fundamental message, a message to which Constant devoted the majority of his writing life. The prob lems of modern freedom (whether the absorption in commerce decried at the end of the Liberty of the Ancients, or the self-consciousness analysed in Adolphe) can only be mitigated by the influence of modern feeling; and both aspects of modernity, modern feeling and modern freedom, must feature in any attempt to understand Constant's political thought. Honesty and Utility Bearing this emphasis on feeling in mind, let us now turn to the other aspects of Constant's thought, bringing the lessons of De la Religion to bear upon them. In several contexts, we have come across Constant's argument that the good arises from the pursuit of feelings and ideals as ends in themselves — in art, in morality, in religion and love — repeated. Only when the spontaneity of natural feeling is disturbed do tensions and injustices arise: 'tout se tient dans la nature'.46 Constant's conception of nature knows no self-interest if it is left free of outside domination. The analogies with Rousseau's nature, one where the outflow of the heart's innermost impressions is entirely ordinary, is obvious: 45 Ibid., pp. 28-9: pantheism 'n'en est pas moins destructif de toute distinction entre le Créateur et les créatures, de toute justice distributive et de toute protection spéciale dans 1 ' un, de tout mérite moral et de toute prière efficace dans les autres, en un mot de tout ce qui satisfait le sentiment religieux'. 46 Todorov, Benjamin Constant, p. 23.</page><page sequence="16">82 A. PITT but Constant injects a new historical sense into the equation. Nature, the prov ince of the free man, the fulfilment of man's highest freedom, lies in the future, is progressively appearing to us. It is unusual, of course, in that Constant combines such an evolutionary means of enquiry with an idea of nature that belongs to a less relativist perspective — but his portrayal of history as one in which the potential for the abuse of power is progressively decreased allows him to argue that human nature has nowhere, in fact, been entirely freed. It is only when some of the material rigours of primitive life and the influence of priests and of tyrants have been escaped that nature is free to flourish: human sentimental nature, which, when free, is the source of all goods. What are the details ot the ethical mechanism underlying his contidence in feeling's effects? Feeling is always associated in Constant with the absence of calculated interest47 as a motive: setting aside the obvious rationalism of the Kantian idea, Constant's 'feeling' thus has some affinities with the categorical imperative, with the insistence on the elimination of any consideration of con sequences in ethics. The comparison with Kant breaks down of course on the question of sentiment: for Kant, true goodness excludes any emotional basis, since emotion belongs to our animal character (including transparently desir able innate traits, like kindness48), and hence is unfree. The results may be good, but a good act arising not from reason but from feeling is no fit subject for true moral debate, Kant argued. It is debatable how far we can identify Kantian rea son, Vernunft, with pure abstract intellection, but the gulf here between him and Constant is plain. The 'sentimentalism' of De Staël's particular Kantianism has been addressed elsewhere;49 and Constant evidently shares this peculiarly French, Rousseauean, framework in which Kant was understood and to some extent revered: where an elevated conception of 'conscience' was inevitably associated with Rousseau's idealization of 'natural' feeling and its moral purity. The debate between Constant and Kant on the subject ot lying is justly a famous one, since it takes us to the heart of their respective ethical systems. Constant's specific debate with Kant concerned lying — particularly Kant's riposte to a work by Constant, that in all cases it is a duty to tell the truth, even where that truth will cause severe and obvious suffering to the subject or to others (for instance giving information to a burglar under duress). Constant's common-sense argument to the contrary has been presented as a form of utili tarianism: the consideration of possible suffering must enter our moral calcu lations.50 Yet, as I have stressed above, truth-telling and the treating of others 47 See Todorov on the 'reign of interest', ibid., pp. 65-75. 48 Immanuel Kant, Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone (New York, 1960), p. 23. 49 Fontana, Benjamin Constant, pp. 116-17. 50 Stephen Holmes, Benjamin Constant and the Making of Modern Liberalism (New Haven, 1984), pp. 104-25.</page><page sequence="17">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 83 as ends in themselves were central considerations for Constant also, founda tions of his political thought as much as they were for Kant. Their divergence here may well arise from Constant's naturalism: honesty is an overriding good, but when our feeling (the essential source of motives for Constant) for self-preservation overrides our duties towards the object of our truthfulness or lying, then his doctrine, founded on the natural sentiments, would seem to jus tify a relaxation of principle in extreme cases where Kant's intellectualism does not. A sense of duty carried to such lengths defies common sense and starts to sound like calculation in its basic ignorance of the heart and its needs. Honesty remains an ethical ideal for Constant: but his interpretation of it is far closer to truth to self, truth to the emotions, than it is to Kant's technical verac ity. In other words, in Constant's ethics the primary good is, again, autonomy in a full human sense. Constant persistently claims that there is an ultimate compatibility of all moral goods —- utility ultimately is duty, which is justice, which is a product of the primary feelings. The mediating factor upon which all the virtues are built is 'natural sentiment', which draws us more or less successfully away from a grasping, narrow egoism and towards such a fulfilment of all possible goods in a heightened fellow-feeling and the apprehension of our true duty of self-sacrifice. Constant's most elaborate critique of Bentham, an equally familiar one from the historiography, is helpful in further clarifying Con stant's doctrine of feeling as an end in itself — Stephen Holmes has noted the striking similarities between their philosophical programmes. They shared an obsessive fear of the potential for political corruption in the self-interest of unsupervised corporations; and both accordingly accentuated the need for clarity and transparency in political institutions. Constant's persistent claim was, however, that the idea of utility was self-defeating:51 political justice is indeed useful, but if we overstress its utility, we will be tempted to take the short-cut of maximizing our own utility at the expense of the whole — and hence we forget that it is only the very universality of moral rules that makes justice useful at all. Applied to any other end, calcul destroys the intrinsic util ity of duty and feeling. The primary feelings, those that give rise to a sponta neous honesty with others, and the actions to which they give rise, are intrinsically useful and just.52 It is only when virtue is forced to the service of something else (the calcul discussed in the section on primary and secondary emotions above, here the utilitarian calculation) that corruption enters in. The moment religion — pure sentiment, yet source of all other goods — is used, its virtue disappears. Similarly duty — increasingly identified by Constant with a religious ideal of sacrifice which was quite basic to Mme de Staël's more mys tical perspective — is valuable in its consequences only so long as it was prac tised for the love of itself. Utility itself is destroyed when it is accorded 51 Holmes, Benjamin Constant, p.125. 52 See above, p. 67.</page><page sequence="18">84 A. PITT primacy in the pantheon of the virtues. Justice is utility, but it should always be accorded moral and philosophical priority.53 'Law is a principle; utility is only a result; law is a cause, utility is only an effect.'54 To pursue anything out side itself is to lose sight of the real sources of justice: a spontaneous and self-sufficient sense of the good, arising ultimately from the sentimental capacity of human nature. It is not here that we should look for Constant s similarities with Bentham, but in his general sense of comfort with the characteristics of the modern age. It is absolutely clear that unlike Rousseau, Constant holds ultimately with the benefits of modernity. Is this merely out of the respect for the individual rights that commercial society seemed to protect so well from the vantage point of the Revolution? Partly, of course, as the discourse on the liberty of the mod erns reveals. Here Constant's liberalism is in agreement with that of Bentham and the other individualists of the Enlightenment, most notably Hume, whose critique of religion we have considered throughout this paper. Yet Constant's view of modernity does not end here, of course. Adolphe is particularly elo quent on the complications of modern life, particularly the rise of a new self-consciousness that seems to strike at the foundations of the feeling that is fundamental to Constant's idea of the good society. Rousseau's reflections on the deceptions of modern love arose from the same perspective. How can Constant possibly maintain that commercial society supports a more moral humanity? 1 his is the first age, since the bnet tlowenng ot Creek culture in Antiquity, in which one facet of emotion — religious adoration — has been allowed to prosper unfettered (most notably in the United States). Unlike some of his rad ical Enlightenment predecessors, Constant does not doubt for a moment that the future will be religious; yet unlike Rousseau he does not propose that true religion be imposed by force (by means of the civil religion, or the censorship proposed for the Constitution of Poland), but from its one true source, human nature in all its liberty. Modern commercial life has its unique burdens and complications, yet it sustains a society — thanks to the elimination of priestly force — that is characterized by a sense of justice far higher than any mere codification of the rights useful to the functioning of the marketplace. Constant is neither an out-and-out consequentianst, nor an out-ana-oui Rousseauean; his work presents what seems to be a curious, but not altogether incompatible, melange of the two perspectives. Ultimately, he finds consequentialism abhorrent in ethics: yet, from the utilitarian school he never theless derived a sense of respect for the achievements of modernity, and from Rousseau a richer sense of the springs of human action. Religion was funda mental to his understanding and appreciation of both schools of political argument. 53 Constant, 'De M. Dunoyer', Mélanges, pp. 144-5. 54 Constant, Mélanges, pp. 145-6.</page><page sequence="19">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 85 Constant's Twin Ideals: Freedom and Authenticity Constant's repeated and emphatic distinction between calcul and sentiment is at its most elaborate in the history of religion, but the stereotyped opposites of human activity recur throughout his work. In his essay on Fox and Pitt, for instance, Fox is presented as a figure capable of true feeling. He was liberal, spontaneous, and held to a genuine sense of justice; radical though he was, in power he might have seen to a happier resolution to the early conflicts of the French Revolution, might indeed have saved Louis XVI's life. Pitt, mean while, was cold, a master of political calculation. As such he was the typical offspring of an entrenched élite, for Constant, embodying dishonesty. Pro fessing a politics of principle, he, in fact, subordinated all values to the nar rowest understanding of national self-interest when it came to what ought to have been a supra-national sense of natural justice.55 The perspective of De la Religion offers an invaluable insight into the eth ics of Constant's liberalism in a variety of similar cases. Constant seems in so many debates to have occupied a rather unclear intermediate position between theoretical extremes: between a consequentialist naturalism and a near-Kantian deontology in ethics; between the individualism of the classic 'natural harmony of interest' doctrines and an emphasis on a traditional con ception of disinterested duty as the only viable basis for political justice; between Gibbonian irony and religious sincerity; between a sweeping politi cal cynicism and a Rousseauesque, idealist radicalism. There are two distinct human natures at play in Constant's work, a fact that might explain some of these dichotomies — a distinction exemplified by the basic opposition of the Egyptian priest and the Greek reflecting freely on the nature of the Gods, the man of self-interest and the man of pure feeling, respectively. For Constant, the assumption of a natural harmony of feeling was critical, yet he never assumed the existence of a 'natural harmony of interests' per se. Feeling may flourish only in the absence of any deceit or manipulation, the essential fea ture of all unequal power relationships. Deceit and manipulation are there between Adolphe and Ellenore, Brahmin and worshipper, Pitt and Parliament; and it is primarily deceit that brings heartlessness and the end of justice in its train. Todorov is eloquent on Constant's consistent tendency to rise above easy generalization. He views his political thought as a unique blend of Rousseau's criticism and Montesquieu's respect for the rights of the individual citizen. For Constant, he writes, '. . . il faut critiquer la modernité, mais en restant soi-même moderne'.56 Recent work suggests that Constant was further from a stereotyped individualism, was far truer to the prevailing assumptions of 55 Constant, 'De M. Fox et de M. Pitt', Mélanges, pp. 322-31. 56 Todorov, Benjamin Constant, pp. 65-72.</page><page sequence="20">86 A. PITT French liberalism,57 than has generally been supposed. I do not wish to contest the moral individualism of his work: it is only when the individual is released from the crude material wants of savagery, and from the heavy-handed manipulativeness of priests, that his true nature is revealed. That nature is inherently just and true, far more akin to the autonomy of Rousseau than to the formal liberty of Hobbes that a crude reading of the Liberty of the Ancients might suggest. Constant places that autonomy not in a distant imagined 'nature', however, as does Rousseau, nor in the solitude of the hermitage: it is, somewhat paradoxically, a nature that is set free only in the most complex of social settings, a culture formed by the high moral code of Christianity and the multifarious pleasures and institutions of a complex commercial society: but it is a commercial society of feeling, and indeed Christian, men that Constant held consistently in mind. Rousseau's ideal — the authenticity and transpar ency of the heart58 — is as much the achievement of the modems as an objec tive for them. De la Religion, obscure though it may be as a profession of faith, and cer tainly dated as an analysis of the religious experience, thus provides some essential clues to the character of Constant's political theory. To conclude, I have emphasized Constant's distance from the more radical religious writings of the Enlightenment. Toleration, the ideal of Hume and Gibbon, was alto gether secondary to truth and authenticity in his personal hierarchy of the vir tues;59 here we encounter the problems of too 'negative' an understanding of freedom in Constant's political thought. Freedom was undoubtedly an ideal, but it was not freedom to withdraw into a purely private zone, nor freedom to forget one's spiritual duties: but freedom, again, to perfect nature, to develop 57 In which, speaking generally, economic individualism was regarded with far more suspicion than in its English equivalent. Constant has been presented as an isolated figure because of his seemingly confident approval of individual freedom — unlike Tocqueville, in particular, who was of course obsessed with the need to establish a powerful collective ethos in a democratic state. The ground separating them, in fact, was far less wide than this traditional opposition would suggest. Both upheld a moralistic critique of narrow individualism that owed its origins to Christian teaching. 58 Rousseau: 'How sweet it would be to live amongst us, if the external countenance were the image of the heart's disposition', quoted in Jean Starobinski, Jean-Jacques Rousseau: la transparence et l'obstacle (Paris, 1971), p. 13. 59 Remember Constant's argument that austerities are a result of the priesthood's misapplication of what should be an essentially spiritual and moral sacrifice of self-interest. Hume, on the contrary, argues that monotheism itself gives rise to such abuses: when combined with superstition, it (unlike the religions of antiquity that admit of imperfections in the nature of the gods) can 'sink the human mind into the lowest submission and abasement, and . . . represent the monkish virtues of mortification, penance, humility, and passive suffering as the only qualities, which are acceptable to him'. David Hume, Four Dissertations (London, 1757), p. 65. The whole character of Hume's work is alien to Constant's essential piety: in essence, the difference arises from Constant's fundamental admiration for religious enthusiasm.</page><page sequence="21">CONSTANT'S DE LA RELIGION 87 ever truer and truer feelings. The modern world may give a larger scope to the individual in his pursuit of his own religious truth, but it is a society which, if it maintains its respect for individual liberty, will be marked by moral earnest ness and by love, far from the easy and world-weary sociability that marked the ideal of the Enlightenment authors who gave the initial impetus to his most important work. Toleration, an excellent example of the liberty of the mod erns, is not an end in itself but essentially a product of the one great good of feeling. In this, Constant held, monotheism and the Christian doctrine of sac rifice have cleared a path for an essentially modern ethic that demonstrates not only a historically unique respect for the integrity of individual rights but which can include and even surpass all the supposed moral advantages of the ancient world. At times Constant presents a Tocquevillean argument for the necessity of religion to a free political society: A free government needs religion, for it needs disinterest; and incredulity, even with the purest intentions, reduces everything, must reduce every thing, to enlightened self-interest in order to defend freedom. One needs to know how to sacrifice one's life; and what can be more important than life, for the man who sees no further than nothingness?60 The highest of social virtues for Constant was not freedom, but honesty before God and before man. The former ideal is always subordinate to the latter, except in the special sense that freedom is an important precondition of moral honesty and emotional integrity. Constant's religious faith served to bolster a perspective in which freedom and religious enthusiasm (far from the assump tions of his early Enlightenment models) are mutually supportive. Without an appreciation of his basic theism, the details of his liberalism, especially the relative places of the twin ideals of formal liberty and authenticity within it, are incomprehensible.
