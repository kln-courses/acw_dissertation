<plain_text><page sequence="1">lie QUARTERLY Sprituality in Global Society The twentieth century saw the end of colonialism, Fascism, Marxism-Leninism and also heralded the collapse of unrestricted capitalism. Globalization has emerged as the new watchword now and while it has certainly brought tremendous benefits in many fields including trade, commerce, tourism and international cultural exchanges, it has a darker side as well. Pandemics, the abominable practice of human trafficking, arms smuggling, drug trafficking, and terrorism - all these have now assumed global dimensions. Clearly, if humanity is to survive in a global society that is sane, secure and sustainable, the present hyper-consumerist, ultra-promiscuous and super-materialistic lifestyle will have to yield way to a more holistic paradigm in which spirituality plays a pivotal role. Our present societal milieu impels us to reflect deeply on how the entire concept of spirituality needs to be rearticulated in the light of By Karan Singh</page><page sequence="2">SPIRITUALITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY the paradigms of the emerging global society. In this exercise, the first point is the relationship between spirituality and the world's great religions. Until recently, both were considered to be closely inter-connected, one flowing from the other, but of late there is a growing view that religion, in fact, can sometimes have negative and exclusivist connotations, whereas spirituality transcends barriers of race and religion, sex and sexual preference, language and nationality, and is, therefore, best suited for the emerging global society. In my view, what we need is not a wholesale rejection of religion but a reassertion of certain universal precepts that will enable us to cope with the challenges and hazards of globalization. Many of them are to be found in humanity's great religious traditions, but they need to be rediscovered, renewed and reaffirmed in the contemporary context. I will attempt to do so from the viewpoint of the world's most ancient continuing religion, Hinduism, and from India, the mother of spirituality. The first such precept, and perhaps the most fundamental, is to accept that there are multiple paths to the divine. As the Rig Veda says 'Ekam sad viprah bahudha vadanti' (the Truth is one; the wise call it by many names). It is the height of hubris to claim that any one religion alone holds the monopoly of Truth. Had this been the divine will, we would not have had more than a dozen major religions with hundreds of sects flourishing on the planet. Who are we, denizens of a tiny speck of dust in the infinite universe around us, to claim that the divine can appear only in this form, in this place and at this time? Stephen Hawking, probably the greatest living scientist, has said that there are at least a hundred billion galaxies in the universe, each containing tens of millions of stars with their own planetary systems. If that be so, then how can we know in what form and in what circumstances the illimitable divine has manifested itself elsewhere in the universe, and what levels of consciousness may have developed on other worlds? In the Hindu tradition the universe itself is conceptualized as a manifestation of the divine, and Shiva Nataraja as the supreme creator whose eternal cosmic dance to celestial rhythms brings billions of galaxies into being, whose hands hold the promise of individual salvation, and in whose conflagration ultimately all manifestation perishes in the endless cycles of Time. Be that as it may, my point is that it is unacceptable for any one religion to claim 27</page><page sequence="3">lie QUARTERLY a monopoly of Truth. I may proclaim that my religion is best, but that gives me no right to do violence to other religions, far less to attack and kill fellow human beings in the name of religion. The irony is that each religion considers its version of the divine to be benevolent and compassionate. Yet, despite these beliefs, the history of mankind from its very dawn has been scarred with inter-religious conflicts that to this day cause distress and devastation around the world. Let us be clear, until there is harmony and understanding between religions there will never be peace on earth. The second precept, which is particularly appropriate in global society, is that of the world as a family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - enunciated many thousands of years ago in India. It is only now with the astounding breakthroughs in science and technology that this has come within the realm of possibility. Instant communication has literally knit the world into a global community, and the Internet has opened the gateways to human interaction transcending all barriers of space and time. However, here again we are up against a major problem. The Westphalian concept of fully sovereign nation-states may have served a useful purpose in the evolution of human society over a period of time, but now, when we are striving to move forward towards a seamlessly knit global society, this very concept seems to have become a hindrance. Even after the end of the Cold War there have been dozens of localized conflicts that have claimed millions of lives and made refugees of many more millions around the world. In fact, the nation-states are now being transcended by regional associations, notably the European Union and ASEAN. In such collectives, the states - while retaining their individuality - have synergized their strengths and built upon their limitations to bring into being more cohesive and effective communities. In my view, this positive path opens new vistas with rich possibilities that nations need to seriously explore. Instead of two hundred or so nation-states, we should move into a situation with about a dozen regional clusters. Those, in turn, could then develop into what has been eloquently described by the poet as 'the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the World'. The United Nations, as at present constituted, is frozen in a time warp and has remained inflexible for more than six decades. As a result, with the Security Council's permanent members representing well under half of the world's population, it is Karan Singh</page><page sequence="4">SPIRITUALITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY incapable of articulating the aspirations of a large segment of people and reflecting the vastly changed political situation since 1945. Let it also be remembered that the 'world as a family' is not the same as the 'world as a market'. The family is a supportive and humanizing social entity, whereas the market is often manipulative and exploitative in nature. If we really aspire for a sustainable world order we will have to reorganize the global economy in a way that uplifts the one-third of the world's population living below the poverty line to a way of life where they receive at least the minimum inputs necessary for a decent human existence. I have based my vision of the new spirituality on these three precepts - the essential harmony of religions, the world as a family and the imperative of eradicating poverty because, in my view, without addressing these complex issues any discourse on spirituality becomes an empty exercise. One of our great savants, Swami Vivekananda, used to say that preaching spirituality to someone who is starving is insulting him; feed him first and then give him your religion. Accepting the premise of the 'world as a family' also involves a radical shift in our attitude towards nurturing the planet. In the Hindu view we look upon the human race as part of nature, by no means enjoying dominion or the right to exploit and destroy the natural environment. The 63 verses of the Hymn to the Earth in the Atharva Veda several thousand years ago have an extraordinary articulation of ecological values, and clearly portray the reverence in which the Earth was held in those times, and which we have now to rediscover. I will quote only five of these verses: Earth, in which lie the sea, the river and other waters, in which food and cornfields have come to be, in which live all that breathes and that moves, may she confer on us the finest of her yield. Earth, in which the waters, common to all, moving on all sides, flow unfailing, day and night, may she pour on us milk in many streams, and endow us with lustre. Pleasant be Thy hills, O Earth, Thy snow-clad mountains and Thy woods! â–  29</page><page sequence="5">lie QUARTERLY On Earth - brown, black, ruddy and multi-coloured. The firm Earth protected by Indra, on this Earth I stand, unvanquished, unslain and unhurt. May Earth with people who speak various tongues, and those who have various religious rites according to their places of abode, pour for me treasure in a thousand streams like a constant cow that never fails. Whatever I dig from the Earth, may that have quick growth again. O purifier, May we not injure Thy vitals or Thy heart. It is Planet Earth, known as 'Gaia' in the Greek tradition and 'Bhavani Vasundhara' in the Hindu, which has nurtured consciousness up from the slime of the primeval ocean to where we are today. Will we convert it into a burnt-out cinder circling the sun unto eternity, or will we develop the wisdom and compassion even at this late hour, to save it from destruction? Clearly, any talk of spirituality has to include a renewed reverence for the Earth, and the creatures that inhabit it, whether it is the highly endangered tigers in Asia, or the magnificent whales in the Pacific. In 1986, a meeting was held in the Great Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi where representatives from various religions prepared 'Declarations on Man and Nature'. I had the privilege of writing the Hindu Declaration. Reading those documents, one is struck by the commonality of views between the various religions regarding Earth and the natural environment. Unfortunately, in our zeal for unplanned and reckless development we have inflicted serious damage upon the Earth in the last century, and unless there is a drastic reordering of our priorities this will continue to escalate in the years and decades ahead. The horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that will cause calamitous damage to human, ocean and plant life, is a dramatic example of how our obsessive search for oil has ended up grievously wounding the planet. This is far removed from the spirituality we seek in the global society. We must now define what spirituality actually is. My definition would be that it is the attempt to access the deepest and highest power, whether we call it God, the Atman, the Buddha, Nature or by Karan Singh</page><page sequence="6">SPIRITUALITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY any other name, and whether we consider it to be within our deeper selves or outside of us. This yearning for unity with the divine is the essential feature of spirituality. A beautiful poem by Francis Thompson has the following lines: Not where the wheeling systems darken, And our benumbed conceiving soars! The drift of pinions, would we hearken, Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors The angels keep there ancient places; Turn but a stone and start a wing, 'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces, That miss the many-splendoured thing. It is the quest for 'the many-splendoured thing' that represents the essence of spirituality, what the Bible calls 'the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world'; what the Sufis call 'the Noor-i-Ruhani', what the Buddhists call 'the Bodhi-Chitta', what the Hindu seer means when he exclaims 'I have seen that Great Being shining like a thousand suns beyond the darkness'. In every religious tradition, there is this transcendent and luminous dimension of spirituality, the belief that each human being embodies a spark of the divine, and that fanning it into the shining fire of spiritual realization is the highest meaning and purpose of our lives. In the Hindu tradition, there are four major paths to bring about this union or 'Yoga', a word that comes from the same root as the English word 'yoke' and implies the ways of relating the divine within us with the all-pervasive divine without; God immanent with God transcendent, which inevitably involves altered levels of consciousness. These four great highways, of course, have hundreds of subsidiary paths and practices. The first is what we call the Jnana Yoga or the way of Wisdom. This is based largely on the teachings of the Upanishads and, in the West, would be somewhat akin to the Platonic dialogues, the effort to cleanse and control the fluctuating mind so that it is able to discriminate between the eternal and the ephemeral. The second path is known as the Bhakti Yoga, the way of Devotion. While the Jnana Yoga does not necessarily need an anthropomorphic form, 31</page><page sequence="7">lie QUARTERLY in the Bhakti Yoga, which involves an overwhelming emotional relationship with the divine, such a form is considered necessary, whether that is Jesus Christ, or Lord Shiva or a Bodhisattva or any other. In this category come great saints who have literally fallen in love with the divine. India has had numerous such saints and, in the West, there have been people like St. Francis of Assisi, St. Theresa of Avilla and St. John of the Cross. In Islam there are the glorious compositions, the Masnavi, of Mewlana Jalal-ad-Din Rumi that he poured out in devotion to his spiritual guide, Shams-e-Tabrizi. If Jnana Yoga is the way of clarifying the mind and Bhakti Yoga the way of the heart, the third major path is called Karma Yoga, the way of dedicated works. It is a powerful means of spiritual growth as it involves dedication of whatever we do to our chosen form of the divine. Work done with this attitude of mind brings us closer to our goal of Yoga. This is the path of good works epitomized by Martha in the Bible, by Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity, the Ramakrishna Mission and other institutions dedicated to serving the poor, the needy and those in pain. However, it must be remembered that in Karma Yoga these tasks must be undertaken in a spirit of devotion and dedication to the divine, and not only for 'doing good'. The fourth path is the Raja Yoga, the royal path, and this involves the understanding of hidden powers within the human body that can be accessed through the process of Hatha Yoga, which includes various physical and breathing exercises that, in the West, are generally referred to as 'Yoga'. It is believed that we can attain higher levels of consciousness with this type of Yoga that brings us closer to the divine. The teachings of Hermes Trimajestus, Meister Eckhart and other great Western mystics are of great value in this context, as they point to the possibility of transformation of consciousness, as are the teachings of C.G. Jung leading finally to what Christians call the 'beatific vision', the Buddhists Nirvana and the Hindus atma-darshan. I would like to dwell for a moment on Raja Yoga and its implications for the transmutation of consciousness. In the Hindu tradition it is believed that there is a spiritual energy called the Kundalini, which resides coiled up like a serpent at the base of the spine. Under certain circumstances and special breathing and other exercises, this power can be aroused so that it moves up the spine, and, as it does so, it energizes seven chakras or plexuses from the base of the spine right up to the brain. The awakening of these Karan Singh</page><page sequence="8">SPIRITUALITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY chakras involves attaining new levels of consciousness, until finally the power floods into the brain thereby leading the practitioner to the bliss of illumination. This whole process based upon Patanjali's classical Yoga-sutras has been widely expanded in many significant texts down to the present day. The great evolutionary philosopher, Sri Aurobindo, has pointed out that there is no good reason to believe that evolution has concluded with the advent of normal human consciousness. He asserts that in the same way as life evolved from mineral, vegetable and animal into human dimensions, the evolutionary process is bound to continue into the future. Man, in this view, is an intermediate creature, somewhere between the animal and the divine, a 'work in progress' that needs careful attention. He holds that with the advent of Man, for the first time there is a species on earth which is conscious of itself and, therefore, has the unique opportunity to cooperate with the forces of evolution and telescope what would otherwise take millions of years into a much shorter time span. He postulates many different levels of consciousness above the human; he speaks of the Overmind and then the Supermind; and his yoga revolves around an attempt to bring these forces down and fix them in the earth consciousness. The core of the Transpersonal Psychology movement has revolved around consciousness research. Consciousness research, mapping the brain, studying the mind-body relationship, drawing upon rich material that comes to us in our dreams are all means that help us in reaching a deeper understanding of our spiritual quest, and represent the cutting edge of science, philosophy and psychology. I once asked Nikita Khrushchev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, whether it was possible to be a believer and also a member of the CPSU. He replied in the negative. He said that while they respected religious beliefs, to be a member of the CPSU it was necessary to be an atheist, as that was a cardinal principle of Marxism-Leninism. It is indeed amazing that despite three generations under an atheistic regime, when Russia celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Christianity there was a remarkable outpouring of religious fervour. Another example of this phenomenon was Mongolia. The Marxist regime there destroyed Buddhist temples, burnt and scriptures, killed and tortured their monks. Yet as soon as that regime was 33</page><page sequence="9">lie QUARTERLY overthrown there was an incredible craving for Buddhism. The Indian Ambassador to Mongolia was Kushok Bakula, the venerated Head Lama of Ladakh, who almost single-handedly re-established Buddhism there. I was witness to this when I visited Ulan Bator to inaugurate a school for Buddhist priests that he had established. These examples show how deep-rooted the religious impulse is. However, there is a real danger of the pendulum swinging too far towards the other side, towards fanaticism, fundamentalism and violence. What we need, therefore, and what spirituality can provide, is an approach that incorporates the best of our religious traditions without falling into the trap of dogmatism and exclusivist posturing. Mahatma Gandhi, who was deeply influenced - among others - by the great author Leo Tolstoy, preached throughout his life the path of non-violence, love and compassion. When followed to their logical conclusion, these clearly represent a transformation of consciousness. Gandhiji's thought not only enthused millions of people in India in their struggle for freedom, but also had worldwide ramifications as with Nelson Mandela in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and Martin Luther King, Jr. with the civil rights movement in the United States. Gandhi's famous saying 'an eye for an eye will make everyone blind', and 'there is enough for everyone's need, but not enough for anyone's greed', have profound implications for the global society that is emerging before our very eyes. Representing practical spirituality at its best, Gandhi remains an iconic figure for lovers of peace around the world. In this hour of crisis, humanity would be well advised to take heed of the wisdom represented by a frail man in a loin cloth whose conviction and faith shook the world, and who finally fell to an assassin's bullet. International terrorism in the name of religion is one of the most tragic developments of recent times. Whatever may be the provocations and historic grievances, of which there are many, recourse to violence targeting innocent men, women and children, as in terrorist attacks around the world from 9/11 in New York to 26/11 in Mumbai, are totally unacceptable and have been condemned widely by religious leaders. One of the main challenges that the new spirituality will have to face boldly is the growing nexus between criminal elements around the world, including those based upon religious fundamentalism and fanaticism. These represent the antithesis of spirituality, the 'shadow' as Jung would have it, Karan Singh</page><page sequence="10">SPIRITUALITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY which is being thrown by the glitter and glory of our technological civilization. The integration of the shadow is one of the most important challenges in post-Jungian psychology, and this is a matter upon which a gathering like this will have to ponder seriously. Transpersonal Psychology provides an excellent methodology for steering our minds through the Scylla of nihilism and the Charybdis of fanaticism. It calls upon us to shed our prejudices and open ourselves to higher aspirations and powers. Humanity has to break out of the dark valleys of conflict in the name of religion and strive towards the sun-lit uplands of a new spirituality, a new paradigm of mutual understanding, wisdom and compassion that will help us to build a refulgent global society. I will conclude with an ancient Sanskrit verse that exhorts us to work together, to think together, to achieve together and to eliminate every shred of hatred that may exist between us: Sahanawavatu sahanau bhunaktu sahaviryam karawavahai, Tejaswina vadhitamastu ma vidvishawahai. Aum Shantih Shantih Shantih. 35</page></plain_text>
