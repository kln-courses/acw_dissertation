<plain_text><page sequence="1">346 A. W. BUCKLAND.-Points of Contact between POINTS Of CONTACT between OLD WORLD MYTHS and CUSTOMS and the NAVAJO MYTH, entitled " The Mountain Chant." By A. W. BUCKLAND. THE very curious myth of the Navajo Indians of New Mexico, entitled the myth of Dsilytdje QaVadl (Reared within the Moun- tains) or "The Mountain Chant," with the rites and dances in connection therewith, as given at great length in an elaborate paper by Dr. AWashington Matthews, in the fifth annual report of the Bureau of Ethnology (Smithsonian), contains so many points suggestive of contact with Eastern civilization that it appears to me especially worthy of the attention of Anthro- pologists. The Navajos, it may be remarked, now occupy territory adjoining the Zunis in New Mexico, but are supposed to have come froin much further south. They are at present advanced in the arts of metallurgy, pottery, and weaving, but the myth, and its ceremonial songs and dailces, take us back to a time when stone implements of a very early type were in use, for the hero and his brother are represented as choppiilg down poles for their hut or wigwam with a grooved stone axe, round which they twisted a flexible twig of oak, tied together with the fibre of the yucca, with which rude implement they chopped all day ill order to obtain four poles; they used a digging stick to dig for water, trapped small animals with stone traps, and when they caught them, pounded them up, bones and all, with seeds of grass and other wild plants, and boiled all together in an earthen pot. They do not appear to have had any domestic animals, as not even a doo is mentioned, and there were no horses. The father of these young men seems to have been a medi- cine-man or magician, for after a ceremony of purification by sweatiing, in a bouse built of certain trees, and carpeted with plants on which deer browse, he sent them out to hunt, and to bring the slain deer to him. Of the head and skin he makes a lure for the deer, such as is now used by many Indian tribes., but which was at that time apparently unknown, and then, hanging the pluck in a mountain-mahogany tree, he bids the eldest son, the hero of the myth, shoot at it, himself holding the son's hands and guiding, the arrow; then blowing upon his son towards the pluck, he tells him, "4Now, whenever you want to kill a buck, even if there is neither track nor sian of deer in sight, you have only to shoot into the mountain- mahogany, and you will find a dead deer wherever your arrow</page><page sequence="2">Old World Myths and Customs and the Navajo Afyth. 347 strikes." Here we get that magic arrow which appears so often in Eastern myth anid folk-lore, anld which, in the hainds of the IKing of Israel, guided by those of the dying prophet, was used to prophecy the defeat of the Syrians. The son then armed with magic weapons, goes forth to procure game, but is for- bidden to go to the south, a prohibition which he disregards, and so falls inito the hands of his enemies, the Utes, who are on the point of putting him to death, when he is rescued by the wind-god, who uses as his messenger an owl, or rather, as is explained, a figure wearing the mask of an owl, and this owl- headed divinity accompanies the hero in most of his subse- quent adventures, leadiig, him into caverns, the entrance to which he enilarges by breathing upon them. Tweinty of these houses or caves are entered, and their inhabitants described: they are sometiines birds and aniimals, and sometimes men in the form of animals. It would be impossible to describe all these, but two or three are especially noticeable. In the house of the buish-rat is the first notice of that curious auid widespread taboo with respect to eating in the under-world, or abode of the dead, known to classical readers as the myth of Persephone, but which, with slight modifications, appears in the folk-lore of almost all races. In the present instance, the wife of the bush-rat offers the hero lhusks and rubbish for food, but the wind-godl whispers to him to ask for some of the contents of two jars which are filled with good nuts and berries, yet, when these are given, the voice of the wind-god says "Eat not of the food of the rats in the home of the rats, if you would not become a rat; wait till you go out to-night." This same prohibition is repeated four times- in the house of the rats, the bears, the porcupines, and the squiirrels, but in the case of the latter the taboo extends only to nuts, aiid he is allowed to eat service-berries. The object of all these visits to gods, and to men in animal form, is to receive instr uction in the rites and cerenonies which he is afterwards to teach to his people. Thus, in several visits, pictures are shown him, drawn upon the clouds, which he is to copy in sand, and he is taught how to make certain sacrificial sticks, which have to be painted and buried with much ceremony; how to paint, dress, and prepare the messengers sent to summon people to the games and dances; how to make arid swallow, or pretend to swallow, plumed. arrows; things which appear to me to be unique in the ritual of uncivilized races, and which, although they may seem to I The connection of the owl, or of the wind-god in the form of an owl, with this food prohibition is noteworthy, since, in the classical legend, Ascalaphas, who saw Persephone eat the pomegranate, was turned into an owl.</page><page sequence="3">348 A. W. BUCKLAND.-Points of Contact between us trivial and unmeaning, are regarded by the Navajos as of immense importance. The visit to the house of the Great Serpelnt deserves especial notice. The name of the locality is particularly sugguestive: it is called " The Circle of Red Stones," and the entrance is a hole in the rocks guarded by two rattlesnakes, and covered by two pifion trees for a door. These trees move of their own accord, and the rattlesnakes hiss and thrust out their tongues, but do not bite the hero, who, led by the wind-god, enters the cavern, to find himself in the presence of a bald-headed old mian, having a little tuft of hair over each ear. This is the Great Serpent, who shows thie Indian how to make the sacriticial sticks of the Great Serpent, and how to plant them. He then proceeds to the house of the Lightning, where he is threatened with destruc- tion by thunder-bolts and lightning, but he escapes and enters a house of black clouds, which is the house of the Lightning, where he finds the lightning-god, bald like the Great Serpent, with only a little tuft of hair over each ear, the room being illuminated by four lightning birds, who flash coloured lightniilg from their taloins. Dr. Brinton regards the serpent and the lightning to be identical in Indian mythology, but in this Navajo myth they are evidently separate gods, although closely allied, both beingr described as bald-headed, with small tufts of hair over the ears, a peculiarity which is deserving of notice, because, unless I am much mistaken, the Japanese dragon is often thus represented, and this particular method of shaving the head is a ceremonial usage both in Japan and among the Red Indians. In Japan we are told that "on the fifteenth day of the eleventh month of the third year, the child's hair is cut. Up to this time the whole head is shaven, now three patches are allowed to grow, one on each side and one at the back. During the ceremony the child is placed facing the point of the com- pass auspicious for the year," and it is further observed that the head is covered with cotton, with an end hanging down behind, to which is attached a piece of fish,' thus giving a totemistic meanina to the cereinony, similar to that in use among several tribes of Red Indians. Among the Onahas, for instance, the hair-cutting ceremony is performed by the keeper of the sacred pipes, who receives presents for his part of the ceremony, which consists of cutting the first lock, tying it up and placing it in a sacred buffalo hide, the father concluding the ceremony by cutting the rest of the hair, leaving two or more tufts, in accordance with the totem of the gens to which I " Tales of Old Japan," A. B. Mitford.</page><page sequence="4">Old World Myths and Customs and the Navajo Myth. 349 the child belongs, and it is noteworthy that this ceremony, as in Japan, takes place in the child's fourth year.' The reverence for the cardinal points in both cases is also deserving of notice. In the myth we are considering, the cardinal points appear to be the chief objects of worship; every- thing is arranged in reference to them, the east being chiefly honoured, and a special colour being assigned to each. This, however, is not peculiar to the Navajos; in almost all Indian tribes the nunmber four is sacred, and the cardinal points are denoted by different colours. Among the Navajos these colours are white for the east, yellow for the west, black for the north, blue for the south; whilst, among the Zunis, the east is white, the west black, the north yellow, and the south red. This variation in the colours adopted by different tribes, causes a difficulty in the interpretation of coloured symbols; but it is evident that a similar symbolism existed in ancient Mexico, and that the sign of the cross, which appears so frequently in Mexican and Central American pictures and sculptures, denoted the cardinal points, and perhaps the winds blowing from them. Returning to the myth, we find that after the hero has been duly instructed in the religious and medicinal rites and dances, which he is to introduce, he is sent back to his own people, but finds his father's lodge insupportable until he has ulidergone a ceremony of purification so-called, prescribed by a shaman in order to remove the effects of the strange food he had consumed in his wanderings. After this, he spends four days and four nights in relating his adventures, and then the first ceremony in accordance with the new rites takes place, other tribes being summoned to attend by swift lcunners, dressed according to the fashion prescribed by the butterfly-gods of the myth. At this assemblage of tribes, we find races run for very heavy stakes introduced, in which the Navajos being victorious, win great wealth, consisting of strings of coral, turquoise and shell beads, large vessels of shells, beautifully tanned buck- skins, dresses embroidered with porcupinie quills, and suits of armour made of several layers of buckskins, now no longer worn. Soon after this, the apotheosis of the hero takes place, under circumstances reminding one of that of Elijah. He takes his younger brother to the Black Mountains-" And as they sat 1 In Landa's account of the ceremony of baptism in Yucatan, we are told that the children (boys) of the age of three, who came to be baptized, had somnething white fastened among the locks at the back part of the head; this, at the cere- mony, was cuit off by the priest with a stone knife.

BUCKLAND.-Points of Contact between, there Dsilyi Neyanil said, 'Younger brother, behold the holy ones,' but the younger brother could see no one. Then he spoke again, 'Farewell, younger brother! From the holy places the gods come for me. You will never see me again; but when the showers pass and the thunder peals, 'There,' yotu will say, 'is the voice of my elder brother,' and when the harvest comes, of the beautiful birds and grasshoppers, you will say, 'There is the ordering, of my elder brother.'" As he said these words he vanished. The younger brother looked all round, and seeing no one he started for his home. When he returned to his people he told them of the departure of Dsilyi Neyani, and they mourned as for one dead. The ceremonies ilnstituted in accordance with this myth, and which are undertaken chiefly for healing the sick, are described at great length by Dr. Washington Matthews, and it would be imnpossible to follow them. Every part is full of mysterious meaning. The lodge erected is sacred, so also is the great corral surroundilng the space set apart for the dances, and known as " the dark circle of branches "; this is reared to the chant of the shaman, an openiing being left in the east, and which must not be entered except by walking round it to the left; the fire kindled in this corral, within which dances resembling, the Australian corroborees take place, is made of sacred wood of four kinds. Special seats are assig,ned to the performers and to the guests, and even the food of the assistants is prepared in a particular and primitive manner, the bread or cake being made and baked in an earth oven or hole in the ground. In cutting tlle sacrificial sticks, which seem to have a peculiarl-y religious significance, a flint knife is used. The rattle and the whizzer, or bull-roarer-the latter made only, it is said, of a pine tree struck by lightning-are the sacred instruments to accompany the songs and prayers, and a sacred medicine prepared with mlch ceremony is drunk, not only by the patient, but also by the shamani and the spectators. Massage is freely used, and the sacred sticks, arrows and other substances, are pressed to various parts of the body, anid held in the lhand of the patient. Onie of the most singular parts of the performance is the sudden appearance of a man covered with evergreens, resembling our Jack-ini-the-Green, and still more the Duk-duk of the South Sea Islands. This apparition appears to h-ave a mesmeric effect upon the patienlt, wlho is thrown into a trance, from which the shaman rouses himn or her by whistling, and massage. That, however, wlhich is most distinctive in tlis ceremony, 1 This name signifies " Reared within the Motuntainis," and appears to have been assumed by the lhero in the course of hiis adventures, and retainied by him ever after.</page><page sequence="6">Old World fyths and Customs and the Navajo Aytlth. 351 and which appears to me to be unique, is the making, on the ground, of immense sand-pictures, one being made each day for four days, and erased the same day. Every part of these pictures appears to be most carefully designed, and drawn with the greatest attention to the most minute details, the colours of the cardinal points are strictly adhered to, and they are com- menced and erased in a particular order. The first picture represents eight rattlesnakes crossed in pairs, and surrounded by four others stretching across the ends of the picture facing the cardinal points, with a mountain surrounded by a rainbow in the west, the wind-god at the north-east corner, and in the centre of the picture a bowl of sacred water, also sturrounded by a rainbow. The second picture, which is the most complicated, represents four yays, or gods, standing upon rainbows, with their feet towards-the sacred bowl in the centre, and their heads towards the cardinal points, and between each a sacred planit conventionally represented; the whole is sur- rounded by an anthropomorphic rainbow, which is apparently a female divinity among the Navajos, as it is represented with a square head, which Dr. Matthews says is the feminine symbol. Each god bears in his hand various symbolic devices, one being a forked stick, which I regard as appertaining to divination, another is evidently the sacred medicine-bag of the shaman, whilst the third is the mystic swastika, which is here evidently formed of the plumed arrows of the myth, and has a reference to the sun's course, two being borne high up in the heavens, and two low down. Of the other two pictures, one represents four goddesses, who are so very tall that they are adorned with four petticoats, one above the other, because they say no one garment could be made long enough for them; and the other represents the eight sacred plumed arrows, with reddened flint heads, whicl are supposed to be swallowed in the ceremony. The other unique rite of this very remarkable ceremony, consists in the manufacture and burial of the several sacrificial sticks, in accordance with the instructions given to the hero of the myth by the several animal-gods: these are most carefully painted to represent the animal to which they are sacred, and some are adorned with feathers anid beads; they are then buried in particular and prescribed positions; they appear to resemble the messace sticks used by the Red Indians and by the Austra- lians, but I do not remember to have seen any notice elsewhere of the burial of such sacred sticks, except one very curious instance of a similar English custom, given in the Ashmole MSS. (1406), and quoted in Hazlett's "Fairy Mythology of Shake- speare " (p. 276), written about 1600; this is a ' Conijuration for Fairies." 2 A 2</page><page sequence="7">352 A. W.

But when you call, be in cleane life and turne thy face towards the East." Among the dances which conclude the great Navajo ceremony. some are weird and picturesque, some quaint and absurd, somne apparently obscene, but all appear to have a religious and sym- bolic meaning, although intermixed therewith may be found a great deal of trickery, some broad clownish fun, and some clever jugglery. In one instance, the well-known East Indian trick, of causing a plant to spring up, grow and bear fruit, is introduced, the yucca being substituted for the mango. A hundred and sixty-one songs of sequence are given by Dr. Matthews as belonging to this ceremony, the recitation of which is governed by many rules. Colonel Powell, in treating of this ceremony, says it is only one of seventeen known to survive among the Navajos, each lasting nine days, and he says, "This myth exhibits the stage in mythologic philosophy in which zobtheism and physitheism are both represented. In it the phenomena of nature are the work of animal gods, but these gods are becoming anthropomorphic," and he points out a strong resemblance between this myth and some noticed by Schooleraft as existing among the Algonquins and Iroquois. In many points there is a strong affinity to Zuni myths and ceremonies, and among the Zunis we also find the sand-pictures, although they do not seein to have the same religious significance. Religious pictures of a more permanent character appear among Col. Garrick Mallery's " Pictographs of the North American Indians," one of which is reported as having been seen among the natives of New Holland, as used by them in connection with a corrobery or solemn religious ceremony. " It has for its form the most curious painting upon a sheet of bark, done in various colours of red, yellow, and white ochre, which is exhibited by the priest."' In the Navajo pictures the pigments employed acquire extraordiniary sanctity and healing power.

The anthropomorphic rainbow, the lightning and sunbeams, are always represented, for these are the roads by which the god-, travel, and in the myth, the hero, accompanied by the wind-god, walks upon each, after the wind-god has solidified them by breathing upon them. That which strikes me as of special interest in this Navajo myth, and the ceremonies depending upon it, is the absence of everything even symbolical of the shedding of blood. There seems to be no cutting of the person, no slaughter of victims of any kind. The so-called sacrifices are sinmply sticks painted, adorned with beads aud feathers, buried not burnt, possessing, doubtless, a symbolical meaning difficult of inter- pretation; but there is nlo blood used in the decoration of them, they are not even, like the English fairy-sticks, steeped in the " bloud of a white henne "; their nearest equivalents seem to me to be found in the Japanese Go-hei, which originally, we are told consisted of offerings of cloth or hemp tied to rods or twigs, the name signifying " auguist offerings," and it is only of late years that paper has been substituted for cloth. Mainy features in the Navajo ceremonies seem to point un- mistakably to the East, and especially to Japan, where we find the purification by sweating, the ceremonial hair-cutting, the myth of Persephone, or prohibition to eat the food of the under- world, which, however, is a myth which seems universal, being known among the Aimos and New Zealanders, and appearing in m-any European fairy tales. The conjuring trick of the growing plant is decidedly Asiatic, whilst the reverence for deceased ancestors, and for the cardinal points, and the histrionic character of the Navajo cerernonies, certainly point in the same direction, although these are thiings which may have orig,inated in more places than one. In a former paper I pointed out the curious identity between carvings in America New Zealand, and the South Sea Islands, as described and figured by Mr. Dall, in his very important paper on " Masks and Labrets," and I also showed the similarity, amounting almost to identity, between the symbols on engraved shells fotund in Ameri- can mounds and those painted on the sacred drum of Japan; to these may be added the swastika, which appears alike engraved on Japanese bronzes, and portrayed in the Navajo sand-pictures. The bloodless Navajo rites seem also much more in accord- ance with those of China and Japan than with the well- known extremely sanguinary ceremonies of the ancient Mexicans,</page><page sequence="9">354 A. W. BuCKLAND.-Old World M,yths acnd the Navajo Myth. who were geographically their neatr neighbours, and fromn whom it might have been supposed they would have derived some- thing both of myth and ceremonial, but although there is a certain resemblance in the reverence for the cardinal points, and in the colours used to express them, as also in sun and serpent worship, &amp;c., there seems absolutely nothing in com- lon, even in the form of survival, between the human sacri- fices, the scarification of ears and piercing of tongues, the making and smearing, with blood of the hideous idols of Mexico and Central America, and the harmless painted sticks an(d sand- pictures of the Navajo myth, and it is also noteworthy that the vods portrayed in the sand-pictures, are totally unlike the squat, grotesque Mexican figures, being characterised by slenderness and length, whilst the ornaments are few aind simple, and the faces, whether round or square, being, always full face and never in profile. How two religions so diametrically opposed, could have originated spontaneously in contiguous regions and among a lhomogeneous race, is a problem to be solved by those who be- lieve in the indigenous origin of American culture. For myself I have always held that American civilization was partially a foreign product, in accordance with native traditions, and this Navajo myth appears to me to point unmistakably to some connection between the Eastern and Western hemispheres prior to the time of Columbus; but, as Dr. Matthews says, the system of worship to which this myth belongs " might profitably occupy for years the best labour of an earnest student to eluciclate." Since writing the above I have come across two notices which seem to bear somewhat upon the subject. Miss Gordon Cum- ming, in her " Two Happy Years in Ceylon," speaks of a painted stick being carried with great ceremony in the procession of the Perehara, before which the people bow down and worship, the stick being adorned with strings of flowers and partly concealed in silk brocade. Again, she says, " A young tree is cut down, divided into four, and erected as pillars in four temples, the bows and arrows of the gods being carried round these pillars daily during the Pereltar a on four elephants. The Perehara lasts fronm new to full moon, and at the fiull moon fouir priests, bearing four swords of the goddesses, attended by four assistants bearing golden water vessels, containing water drawn just a year before, row some distance up the river and await the first streak of dawn, when suddenly the four priests strike the water with their swords, describing a magic circle in honour of the sun, and at the same instant the attendants empty the water vessels and refill them from within the magic circle drawln by the swords." Here we have the constant repetition of four as the</page><page sequence="10">B. H. CHAMBERLAIN.-Minor Japanese Religioms Practices. 355 sacred number, with evident reference to the cardinal points, whilst the circle drawn by the swords of the four priests, seems to be the origin of the cross within the circle and of the Swastika which, in Asia as in America, symbolizes the cardiiial points and the path of the sun. The sacred water taken from within this circle would appear also to be represented in the bowl placed in the centre of the Navajo sand-pictures, surrounded by sun- beams. The second notice is in a paper by Henry B. M'Dowell, on "A New Light on the Chinese," which appeared in " Harper's Magazine" for December last, in which is recorded the belief of the Chinese in colour, especially red, and mention is made of the custom of erecting a door or sun-gate in the middle of the room on a child's birthday, through which he is carried by the priest, who goes through the same ceremony at each point of the compass, this ceremonv being repeated every birthday till the child is sixteen, evidently the multiple of the sacred number four. There is also a reference to the Shinto religion of Japan, in which it is said that pilgrimaaes are made to the shrine of Ise, where wands, or harai, are procured by every true believer. On arriving home these symbols of growth are placed in the kama ama shelf of the gods. 1 The illustrations are taken from objects presented by Mr. Chamberlain to the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford.</page></plain_text>
