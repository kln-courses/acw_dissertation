<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ranga-mandapa of the T?tikkompu Temple A Study of an Iconographic Programme of the Vijayanagara Tradition by S. GOPALAKRISHNAN T?tikkompu is 8 km to the north of Tintukkal (Dindigul-Anna district) on the highway to Kar?r (x) (via Pallapatti). It is an important centre of Vijayanagara art which has remained outside the purview of art historians. There is a temple to Visnu, called Saundarar?ja 'King of loveliness', the handsome one (T. Alakar), which is noted for a mandapa, housing iconic pieces of workmanship. Though there are several scholarly works on some aspects of Vijayanagara art (2), the regional and subregional variations are still not thoroughly documented (3). The Saundarar?ja Perum?l (4) temple of T?tikkompu (5) is one such example of this gap in research. The ensuing account presents the results of a preliminary survey (6). t1) Karur is supposed to be the capital of the ancient Ceras of Tamil triarchy who ruled over the country during the so-called Cankam age (to A.D. 200). See Pillai 1970. (2) See for example Longhurst (1988, repr.), Mahalingam (1975), Devakunjari (1970), Rajasekhara (1983) and Settar (n.d.). For a detailed list of books and articles, incorporating results of current research see MicheU (1990: 1110), Fritz (1990: 1082-83, 1096), Morrison (1990: 1125-26), Sinopoli (1990: 1149-50) and Dallapiccola (1985). (3) A number of doctoral dissertations have been published. See for example Pillay (1953), Harle (1963), Kalidos (1989), Raman (1972) and Jeyechandrun (1987). See also Narasimhacharya (1917), Prasad (1978, 1980), Rao (1983), Saletore (1982) and Srinivasan (1979). (4) Perum?l is a popular Tamil name used to denote Visnu. (5) T?tti in Telugu means 'palm tree' and gumphu 'group'. So, T?ttigumphu would stand for a forest of palm trees which abound in the region. The word gets corrupted into T?tikkompu in Tamil. The place is also a famous centre of a folk cult, centering around Mutt?lamman (Telugu Muty?lamma; muty?lu 'pearl' and amma 'mother', signifying 'Pearl Mother', i.e., Goddess of Smallpox). There is a concentration of Telugu-speaking people in the region around who migrating from Vijayanagara and its peripheral zones in Andhradesa contributed to the progress of the arts in southern Tamil country of whom the top-ranking personalities were the N?yakkar of Maturai and their offspring, the P?layakk?rar (for details see Rajayyan 1974 &amp; 1974a). There are several villages in the Tintukkal region with the place name suffix, n?yakkanpat? (e.g. B?din?yakkanpatti, N?galn?yakkanpatti, P?ccin?yakkanpatti, etc.) which stand as proof of the N?yakkar role in the cultural history of the region. (6) I am indebted to my guide, Professor Dr Raju Kalidos, and Miss R. Muthulakshmi, who shared their ideas and data in the preparation of the present article. This is part of my programme for the 34th Congress of Asian and North African Studies, held in the University of Hong Kong, August 1993. [1] 415</page><page sequence="2">T?tikkompu lies on a barren tract of land, dry and arid all through the year, except for the monsoon. Noted for its tropical South Indian climate, the place is watered by a seasonal river, called the Kutavan?ru, a tributary of the Amar?vati which drains its waters into the K?veri. This is the only source of fertility to the soil. The land remains fallow during most of the year as the region is subjected to prolonged drought. So, due to the meagre production of wealth, no great work of art exists in the form of temples. However, thanks to the N?yakkar (7) of the Telugu-speaking hamlets around and the Vijayanagara rulers, today a solitary temple of artistic value bears eloquent testimony to the munificence of the alien rulers of the Tamil country who were the masters of war and peace from about the end of the 14th century to the 18th century A.D. (Kalidos 1976: 216-44). The T?tikkompu temple is not that elaborate when compared with the macrocosmic temples of Srirangam, Maturai, Tirupparankunram and Citamparam. It consists of two pr?k?ras within the precincts of which the artistic treasures of the Vijayanagara lay embedded (Fig. 1). The inner cloister is intact and has four separate shrines dedicated to Saundarar?ja, Saundaravalli T?y?r (the Mother, LaksmI), Ant?l (8) and Visvaksena (9) (Fig. 2) respectively. There is a gopura on the eastern section of the tirumatil 'holy wall'. The shrines to Visnu, LaksmI and Ant?l face the east. The chapel for Visvaksena (Fig. 3) is south facing and lies at the Is?na-dik (northeastern corner) of the complex. The second cloister is spacious but devoid of any important structure. There is a mandapa and garuda-stambha at the east end, lying in an axial alignment with the gopura of the inner cloister. At the Nirrutti-dz&amp; (southwest corner) there is a chapel for Cakkaratt?]v?r in front of which a stray piece of the personified disc is found in addition to the one housed in the cella. Parallel to the southern wall of the inner cloister, juxtaposed to the mah?mandapa, called Ann?-mandapa, images of the das?vat?ras are placed, grouped together (Fig. 2). The earliest epigraphical record of the temple would assign the main structure to the late Vijayanagara period. Dated in S?liv?hana era 1551 (A.D. 1629), the inscription gives chronological details of an endowment made by R?j?dhir?ja R?ja Paramesvara R?madeva Mah?r?ya who succeeded Venkatapati I (A.D. 1586-1616) of the Aravidu dynasty (Sil, V, 291). It is not known whether the record pertains to the foundation of the temple or donations for other purposes. The mah?mandapa of the principal shrine is called Sundara-P?ndyan-^^^p?^ in another record. But the (7) Historians use the term, N?yak (Aiyar 1924; Vriddhagirisan 1942; Srinivasachari 1943; Swaminathan 1957). The Telugu form is N?yakudu (Skt. N?yaka 'hero'). The Maturaittala Varal?ru, a traditional account of the 'History of Maturai', calls them N?yakkar (Aiyar 1924: 373-84). (8) Ant?l was a famous woman-mystic and one among the twelve Vaisnava Alv?rs of the Tamil country. She came to be equated with Bh?devi and provided with a separate chapel in the Visnu temples of Tamilnadu (e.g. Maturai and Srirangam). The ?nt?l temple of Srivilliputt?r is one of the impressive structures of the Vijayanagara period, noted for its ornate mandapas and pillars. (9) Visvaksena is the Vaisnava equivalent of Ganapati. He is called Cenaimutaliy?r (cenai 'army', mutaliy?r 'leader'), in Tamil tradition. 416 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - A view of the T?tikkompu temple. architectural components of the entire complex are in the Vijayanagara style. There are a few more inscriptional charters which furnish details of endowments for festivals and the regularization of administration. All these belong to the 17th century A.D. So, it may be suggested that the Vijayanagara kings are likely to have rebuilt a temple which perhaps had existed since the P?ndyan times, maybe around the 13th century A.D., but the present structure could not be dated earlier than the 16th century A.D. Architecturally speaking the T?tikkompu edifices are simple. Each and every shrine consists of a garbha grha, mukhamandapa and mah?mandapa. The plinth mouldings are simple with constituent members of upapltha and adhisth?na. The p?da is also simple and consists of pilasters, showing kuthbha- and kostha-panjaras. There is no devakostha, housing images as one may find in C?k temples. But the p?da-varga of Ant?l and Visvaksena shrines have a few miniature sculptures, placed at irregular intervals. The vimdnas are of the dr?vida type and dwarf. They are decorated with stucco imagery of later times, the additions of recent renovations. This applies as well to the stucco, appearing on various Ullas of the gopura also. Though simple, the temple of Saundarar?ja is of some interest. The plinth rises to a considerable height (?2 m) while others do not. This type of temple is called m?takk?yil 'upraised temple'. Usually temples dedicated to Visnu are of this type; [3] 417</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2 - Plan of the Saundarar?ja Perum?l temple (inner cloister), T?tikkompu. I The main shrine of Saundarar?ja.

Steps to such temples are not in axial arrangement with the sanctum but appear on either side and are balustraded. The parapets of the steps are decorated with curul y?lis in typical Vijayanagara style. The most striking part of the temple is the ranga-mandapa of the T?y?r shrine which is linked with the sanctum through a mukhamandapa. The mah?- or ranga mandapa is called Ann?-mandapam (Gopalakrishnan 1993) and the most outstanding of the Vijayanagara monuments of Tamilnadu. Similar works are found at Alakar k?yil (Maturai district) (Rajarajan 1995), Krsn?puram (Tirunelveli district), Srivilliputt?r-?nt?l shrine (K?mar?jar district) and Vellore (North Arcot district) (n). (10) The Maturai and Tirukk?ttiy?r temples consist of ast?nga-vim?nas, providing for three separate cellae in the vertical order and housing m?laberas of Visnu in ?sana, sth?naka and say ana forms (Kalidos 1993: 186). (n) Silpis, traditional sculptors and architects, used to give an undertaking to their patrons to the effect that they would be able to create temples of excellence, excepting those of the quality of T?tikkompu and T?ramankalam. [5] 419</page><page sequence="6">These mandapas are noted for the colonnade of y?li- and sculptural pillars (12). The mukhamandapa is closed on both lateral sides and accommodates a row of five pillars each in the longitudinal (east-west) direction. These are compound pillars and grafted with life-size sculptures. The programme is as follows: south row (west to east) north row 1. Sankhanidhi 2. A King (R?madeva Ray a?) 3. A Queen 4. Another Queen 5. An Attendant Padmanidhi A King (Achyuta R?ya?) A Queen Another Queen An Attendant At the spot where the two mandapas meet, images of Ganapati and Mahis?suramardini appear facing to the east. Ganapati is of the samap?da-sth?naka type. A life-size image, it is a rare type, uncommon with other Vijayanagara temples of the period. Though chronologically apart, it can be compared with an image of the same mould found in the lower cave at Tiruccir?ppalli. The Lord is caturbhuja, holding the pdsa and ankusa in para hastas. The p?rva hastas hold the modaka and a flower. The proboscis is turned to the left, called itampuri 'left warp' in Tamil tradition. The image of Mahis?suramardini is sth?naka, standing on a mahisapitha, popularly called Durg? (13). The image is caturbhuja and holds the characteristic cakra and sank ha in para hastas. The front right hand holds a khadga and the left a flower in the ?m hasta mode. Ganapati and Mahis?mardini, appearing at either extremity of a temple is in tune with an ancient way of thought. Cave temples in the Deccan provide for such a programme; examples being Caves XVI (gopura passage) (Fig. 4), XVII and XXIB. Tiruccir?ppalli in Tamilnadu is a good example in the Far South (Kalidos 1990; 1992). Later temples, such as C?la and Vijayanagara, do not follow the pattern as a rule. T?tikkompu is an isolated example and may have derived inspiration from Tiruccir?ppalli which place lies to the north at about a distance of 100 km. Sankhanidhi and Padmanidhi are of the usual pattern; dwarf, pot-bellied and holding their characteristic sankha and padma respectively. Their proximity to Ganapati and Mahis?mardini is of particular interest which maybe noted in the dv?ra section of the gopura in the Kail?sa (Cave XVI) of Ellora (Fig. 5). These evidences point to (12) Other examples are Tiruv?tav?r (near Maturai) and ?vutaiy?rk?yil. If a survey were undertaken, a copious list could be prepared as there are good examples of later Vijayanagara art at places like Mann?rkuti, Mayil?tuturai, Srimusnam and Tiruv?nnaikk?val. (13) For an arguement why she is not Durg?, see Kalidos (1989a: 7-48). 420 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Plinth of Kailis ^^j^^j^^ Plinth Nandi-mandapa dp dikp?laka-s G Ganapati M Mahisasuramardini s Sankhanidhi p Padmanidhi Fig. 4 - Detail of dv?ra section of gopura, Kail?sa (Cave XVI), Ellora.

The mah?mandapa, otherwise called rangamandapa, houses a total of 14 sculptural pillars, seven on each side. The programme is as follows (Fig. 5): south row (west to east) north row 1. Trivikrama (Fig. 6) 2. Manmatha (Fig. 8) 3. Nrsimha-Hiranya yuddham (Fig. 10) 4. ?rdhvat?ndava-Siva (Fig. 12) 5. Sri R?ma (Fig. 14) 6. Vaikuntham?rti (Fig. 16) 7.

The fagade section of the mandapa consists of two more pillars on both sides and has images of donors to the temple and dv?rap?lakas. There are two musical pillars at the western end of the colonnades. The mandapa, housing sculptural pillars is open on the sides to provide ventilation, otherwise the entire T?y?r shrine would have been engulfed in darkness. The iconographical pieces, added to the pillars are unique in several respects. The pratim?laksana maybe presented in a synoptic form, before analysing their programme and significance. Trivikrama is astabhuja and stands with the left leg lifted above shoulder level. The hands hold the following: sankha, bdna (?), khetaka, held parallel to the lifted foot (left), a knife, khadga (?), flower and cakra. The image is profusely decorated and crowned by a kirita makuta (Fig. 6). Manmatha is satbhuja and holds the following: dhvaja, sugarcane bow, pdsa (left), a flower, ankusa and abhaya mudr?s. He is decorated with sakhal?bharanas, a kirita makuta and endowed with a big moustache (Fig. 8). Nrsirhha-Hiranya yuddham is one of the dynamic themes, appearing as part of the sculptural pillars. Nrsirhha is theriomorphic as usual with a leonine head and anthropomorphic below the neck. The Lord is fierce and violently engaged in a combat with Hiranya. Nrsirhha is endowed with eight hands, all of them engaged in beating Hiranya, excepting two which hold the cakra and sankha. Hiranya holds the khadga and khetaka in his hands (Fig. 10). The next pillar includes another vibrant theme which relates to Siva. The Lord is found enacting lal?tatilakam, one of the difficult karana dance steps. The Lord is astabhuja and exhibits the following (anticlock-wise): agni, p?sa, parasu, kap?la, abhaya, damar?ka, tanka and trisula. The left leg is lifted perpendicularly erect. Apasm?rapurusa lies below the right foot. The ornaments include apatra and makara kundalas (Fig. 12). 422 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 6 - Trivikrama. Fig. 7 - Venugop?la. Sri R?ma appears on the fifth pillar. The Lord is dvibhuja and seated on the shoulder of Hanumat in pralambap?da attitude. It is a rare posture, quite unusual in its application to R?ma. The hands show vismaya mudr? (left) and dhanus (right). The sankha and cakra are carved on the prabh?vali which goes around the image. A similar caturbhuja image has been reported from a temple chariot (Kalidos 1991: fig. 3; here, Fig. 14). Vaikuntham?rti is seated on an asana, provided by the coils of Adisesa. The hoods of the primeval serpent appear behind the Lord's head. The seated posture is sukh?sana. The hands are four and show the following: sankha, gada, padma and cakra. The Lord is attended by Sahkhanidhi and two monkey-heroes (Fig. 16). The last pillar (the first as one enters the pavilion) includes a multi-armed Cakkaratt?lv?r. It represents the personified disc, the Sudarsana-Cakra. During the Vijayanagara period, this form of the nigraha-cakra was elevated to the status of a cult image, as he was believed to ward off evil, and provided with an anthropomorphic form fitted within the rim of a wheel. The image in the T?tikkompu temple is of [9] 423</page><page sequence="10">l^^^^^^j^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fig. 8 - Manmatha. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^f^n^^B 'ftfth Fig. 9 - Rati. this type (cf. Kalidos 1990a: 335-90) and there are two more, one in a separate chapel and another in front of the shrine meant for the Lord. The latter is a stray piece, perhaps cast away due to disfiguration. The emblems the hands hold are the sankha, dhanus, khadga (?), trisula, ankusa, tnusala, b?na, khetaka, gada, hala, agni, p?sa, sakti, parasu, cakra and vajra. The Lord is not only terrific as indicated by the weapons but also belliger ant as demonstrated by the cannavira that he wears. He also has manes and jv?la behind the face (Fig. 18). The north row of sculptures begins with Venugop?la from the western end. The Lord is astabhuja, an unusual attribute. The p?rva hastas show the usual mode of playing the venu 'flute'. The other hands hold the cakra, p?sa (?), agni, b?na, parasu and sankha. The legs are bent and in the kuncita posture (Fig. 7). Rati is seated on a swan vehicle in mah?r?jalil?sana attitude. She is dvibuja and holds a sugarcane bow in the left hand. The right hand is raised (Fig. 9). The next pillar shows Nrsirhha in the attitude of slaughtering Hiranya. The hands are eight of which the top two hold Hiranya's dissected entrails. Two of the 424 [10]</page><page sequence="11">^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fig. 10 - Nrsirhha-Hiranya yuddham. Fig. 11 - Hiranya vadham. hands hold Visnu's usual emblems, the sankha and cakra. The p?rva hastas are engaged in tearing open the demon's abdomen. The other two hold Hiranya tightly. The Lord is depicted in dancing mode with the left leg lifted (Fig. 11). Kali is astabhuja, sth?naka and in ardhamandali posture. She is supposed to have been defeated by Siva in a dancing competition (Kalidos 1996). The hands hold the following: dhanus, sankha, a decapitated human head, kap?la, ghanta, b?na, cakra and trisula. She is angry to the core due to the humiliating defeat and the quality of raudra is symbolised by the jv?la, shown behind the face. She wears a kuccha bandha, a finely tucked mundu 'loincloth' and all kinds of ornaments (Fig. 13). Virabhadra is a fierce manifestation of Siva whose cult was popular during the hey-day of Vijayanagara. There are separate temples for the Lord at Hampi (Udd?na Virabhadrasv?mi) and Lep?ksi. Such temples are not to be found in Tamilnadu but life-size images of the Lord are housed in the mandapas of the temples at T?ramankalam (Kail?san?tha) and Maturai (Min?ksi-Sundaresvara). T?tikkompu is a rare Visnu temple to accommodate the Lord in an important part. There is a similar mandapa in the [11] 425</page><page sequence="12">^^^^^^^^ Fig. 12 - Siva performing lal?ta?lakam. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ CHUB .'^ Fig. 13 - Dasabhuja-K?ll. Alakark?yil temple but it consists of exclusively Vaisnava themes (Gopalakrishnan 1993). The imagery of Virabhadra in T?tikkompu provides for ten hands of which the front two hold a khadga and khetaka. The sword is used to chop off the head of Daksa, the Praj?pati, who rose in revolt against the Cosmic Lord. The other hands show the following: dhanus, mrga, p?sa, ghanta, kap?la (?), tanka, paras'u and astra (Fig. 15). Garuda-N?r?yana is an important aspect of the Lord, popularly called Karivarada. Garuda is one among the sixteen amsavat?ras of Visnu (Kalidos 1986: 183 n.). Visnu, seated on his eagle-mount, is said to have redeemed a pious elephant from the clutches of a fiendish crocodile. The T?tikkompu image is a classic of Vijayanagara art. It represents N?r?yana, seated on the shoulders of Garuda-purusa in pralatnbapdda attitude. Garuda is in ?lid ha attitude and holds the feet of Visnu in meek supplication. The hands are eight and show the following: dhanus, sankha, p?sa, khetaka, khadga, gada, cakra and h?na. The crocodile appears in early medieval art (e.g. Das?vat?ra) but is missing in the T?tikkompu temple (Fig. 17) Cave, Ellora. 426 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 14 - D?sarathi-R?ma, seated on Hanumat. Fig. 15 - Virabhadra. The last image in the north row is labelled K?rttavirya-Arjuna. It is a wrong nomenclature. The image is endowed with dasabhujas, wears a jat? makuta and has a big moustache. The hands hold the following: dhanus, p?sa, parasu (?), stalk of a flower (?), small gada (?), kap?la (?), tanka and b?na. The p?rva hastas hold a khadga. With reference to the number of the hands and attributes the image is to be identified with Kir?ta (Fig. 19). While pointing out the speciality of T?tikkompu imagery, it may be added at the outset that the type of sculptural pillar on which the images appear are typical of the Tamil-Vijayanagara (14) fashion. In the core zone of Vijayanagara art, y?li pillars are prolific and they also provide for miniature sculptures but this type of sculptural (14) After the catastrophe of Talikota, the capital of the Empire was shifted to Penukonda, Candragiri and Vellore. Vijayanagara (mod. Hampi in Karn?taka) was originally a Kannada-Telugu bilingual zone, subsequently rooted in Andhradesa (Candragiri) and saw its fall in Tamilnadu. A. Krishnaswami (1964: 270) aptly remarks, 'from 1592 Chandragiri and later Vellore became Vijayanagars'. So, we are justified in giving shape to the idea of Tamil Vijayanagara' from the historical point of view. [13] 427</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 16 - Vaikuntha(?di)m?rti. I Fig. 17 - Garuda-N?r?yana. pillar is profuse in Tamil temples and adds a new dimension to the artistic legacy of the great Empire. An important perspective of the themes taken for illustration pertains to their cult orientation. Usually Vaisnava temples do not provide for Saiva themes (e.g. the kaly?na-tnandapa of Alakark?yil) (15). T?tikkompu makes a radical departure in this respect. Out of fourteen, four have Saiva iconography and all of them pertain to very important manifestations of Siva, signifying his eminent status. This shows the catholic spirit of the Vijayanagara kings and their N?yakkar descendants of Tamilnadu who were mostly Vaisnavas. Though Vaisnava, some of the N?yakkar clan adored Virabhadra as their kuladevat? and that may be the reason why such forms originally entered a Visnu temple. Chronologically the T?tikkompu temple belongs to the penultimate stage in the art history of Tamilnadu but the thematic elements and aesthetic tenor of the images are in tune with earlier schools. Ganapati and Mahis?suramardini are good examples which reflect features of the early medieval art of Tiruccir?ppalli and (15) For a case study of the Alakarkoyil temple and programme of images in its kaly?na-mandapa see Rajarajan 1995. 428 [14]</page><page sequence="15">^^^^ Fig. 18 - Cakkaratt?lv?r. Fig. 19 - Kir?ta. Ellora. Aesthetically, the Vaikuntham?rti of T?tikkompu is a replica of the two images in the Tirupparankunram north cave (cf. Kalidos 1991: pi. Ib). Similarly, the Hiranya-vadham theme also has its parallel in the Tirupparankunram cave. All these stand to prove the affinity of the T?tikkompu school with Tiruccir?ppalli and Tirupparankunram, famous in the regional art of the P?ndyas. The iconographical themes of juxtaposed pillars present interesting cases for coupling. Good examples are Rati-Manmatha, Urdhvat?ndavam?rti-K?li, Nrsimha Hitanya-yuddham ? Hiranya-vadham (Kalidos 1976: pi. XIa), and Vaikuntham?rti ? Garuda-N?r?yana. Some of them such as Rati-Manmatha, T?ndavam?rti-K?li and Nrsirhha-Hiranya are very popular figures in Vijayanagara art. Similar modes of representation may be found in the Maturai, T?ramankalam, Krsnapuram and Alakark?yil temples. Venugop?la is usually dvibhuja. It is interesting to find him eight-handed. Kir?ta is another important subject. He is locally called Arjuna which is wrong. The valid objection from our point of view is that there is no pretext to provide the Mah?bh?rata hero with so many hands. Images of Arjuna are found in the kilikkattu and 1000-pillared mandapas of the Min?ksi-Sundaresvara temple at Maturai but they are dvibhuja. Again the emblems, carried by the Lord (e.g. bow, arrow, axe, noose and skull), support our identification.
