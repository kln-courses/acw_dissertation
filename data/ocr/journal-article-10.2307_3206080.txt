<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUDITH MIILLER Theitre Populaire de Lorraine: Regional Theatre The new theatre will be the product of permanent teams of theatre professionals, working for a certain public, living in symbiosis with a population, sharing its life and its struggles, militating simultaneously for a revolutionary transformation of society and for the defense of their profession. Jacques Kraemer' W ith these words Jacques Kraemer, director of the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine, both defines his conception of "new theatre" and describes his troupe. The Theatre Populaire de Lorraine produces drama specifically for and about the inhabitants of Lorraine. In the spirit of popular theatre, it reaches the non-public; in the spirit of political theatre, it contests the status quo. It is, indeed, in the tradition of what Peter Brook terms "rough theatre," spectacle which has a socially liberating role, by nature "anti-authoritarian, anti-traditional, anti-pomp, anti-pretense."'2 The working class and lower middle class depend on the region's iron and steel industry. They are now facing a severe economic crisis, as the principal metallurgical companies desert Lorraine for the more profitable mines of Africa. By espousing the working-class cause in their dramatic examination of this crisis, the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine, as Kraemer says, "shares the population's struggles," and, therefore, arouses a theatrical interest in people who have previously had little experience of drama. This dual political and popular inspiration has characterized the troupe since its beginning. Kraemer, who in the late 1950s went to Paris with plans of becoming a second Gerard Philippe, became instead a disciple of Roger Planchon. The latter's dedication to both the theories of Brecht and the people from his native Ardiche, encouraged Kraemer to return to his own region, where theatrical activities were limited to operatic touring companies and a children's theatre. In 1963, back in Metz, Kraemer established a ten-member company, organized as a workers' co-operative, whose stated goals were "to recreate the spectators," awakening their critical faculties to the social and economic situation of Lorraine, and by establishing "a true contact with the public,"3 to encourage the population to go to the theatre and participate in the TPL's extra-theatrical activities. To alert the public to the political and economic machinations of the capitalist system, the TPL chose to present classical and modern works rich in social criticism, con- Judith Miller is completing ber dissertation, for the University of Rochester, "Theatre and Revolution Since 1968.

Quoting Brecht in their first manifesto, they explained the subversive intent of their repertory: Struggling against the river, it will rectify the course, opposing the fruit tree, it will become a hybrid, challenging motion, it will lead to the construction of moving vehicles, attacking society, it will bring about society's transformation.4 To contact the public, they established an extensive information system. They gave skits and held conferences in high schools and at meetings of les comites d'entreprises (cultural committees) of the local unions. The actors held debates after their performances and recruited interested spectators to handle the troupe's publicity. They charged minimal prices, distributed a certain number of free tickets to their plays, and organized cultural evenings for the workers.s Finally, their play programs carried not the typical glossy homage to the actors, but analyses and explanations of their productions. Both through these activities and in their choice of repertory, the TPL followed the methods of Jean Vilar at the Theatre National Populaire de Paris, methods which also informed the activities of other popular theatre groups and the maisons de la culture.6 But whereas the Theatre National Populaire's early activities took place in the liberal Parisian climate, the conservative administration of Metz balked at the TPL's first performance. Its interpretation of Adamov's Paolo Paoli was branded "partisan and hostile."' The play's sardonic condemnation of military-industrial coercion during "the Great War" prompted the city's military governor to retreat in a fury at intermission. From that moment to the present, the TPL has undergone repeated financial crises with no guarantee of aid. The troupe's early years, 1964-1968, were therefore characterized by exhausting theatrical activity both in Metz and on tour in the Lorraine region to supplement the meager subsidies doled out by conservative municipal governments. Nevertheless, by 1968, having avoided an all-out confrontation with the regional powers-that-be, the troupe had firmly implanted itself in Lorraine and acquired a large and loyal following. The events of May 1968 radicalized their political position and made them dissatisfied with a theatre which only treated the region's problems by allusion. During the May strikes, they discontinued their tour of Corneille's Le Menteur in order to present two agit-prop spectacles in occupied Lorraine factories. As for so many other young troupes in this period, this was their first and fateful encounter with a truly massive working-class audience. Their success assured them of the feasibility of a theatre geared both in subject matter and in presentation to a working-class public. 4 Ibid. s Whereas the usual private theatre charges an admission of 15 francs to 50 francs, depending on the location of the seat, the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine sets one price, 10 francs for students and 12 francs for adults, for all seats. 6 The establishment of maisons de la culture in diverse communities throughout France was begun in 1961 under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Subsidized in part by the government, in part by the municipalities, their goal is to sponsor a constant cultural activity in areas deprived of theatre, cinema and conference halls and to encourage the local population to participate in such activity. Today, in 1974, there are nine cultural centers in operation. 7 Theaitre Populaire de Lorraine, "Histoire du T.P.L.," unpub. ms., 1970.</page><page sequence="3">354 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL No longer content with the repertory and the methods of Jean Vilar at the TNP or Roger Planchon at Villeurbanne, the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine decided to produce theatre dealing directly with the economic and social situation of the region. As no such texts existed, the troupe set about writing its own. Its first original work, the 1969 production of Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, according to Kraemer, "affirmed the troupe's personality,"8 for with this production the members adopted a creative method which they continue to use today. The TPL practices a collective dramaturgy in which Kraemer writes the text on a subject agreed to by all the members. The actors and technicians work out choreography, set design and textual modifications during rehearsals. In this manner, in addition to Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, they have produced four other major plays since 1968: La Liquidation de M. Joseph K (1971), Les Immigrds (1972), La Farce du Graully (1973), and Le Retour du Graully (1974).9 All five of these plays share a common Marxist ideology and indict not only specific regional injustices but also the larger capitalist system. The collusion of religious and other charitable organizations with powerful capitalists, the government-industrial complex, the psychological manipulation of workers and their corresponding economic exploitation recur in all; and the brain-washing techniques of mass media, especially television, are virulently attacked. In Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, for example, the troupe censures the French government's control over national networks. M. Joseph, an iron magnate and the villain of the play, appeases a dissatisfied worker with the gift of a television set. To his subordinate's alarmed response, "A TV, isn't that risky?" he replies, "Don't worry, my naive friend, the Corsican [the allegorical figure representing the government] controls all three networks" (p. 58). Because of its opposition to capitalism's use of communication to further its own ends, the TPL also rails against official (capitalist) theatre. The grotesque M. Joseph employs the words of "a playwright, glorified by the Academie Francaise," to explain his strong-arm philosophy: The world is divided into two categories-a few exceptional lions whose mission is to hunt the gazelle and who-it's only justice-reserve the largest part of the feast for themselves-and the others-an immensity of imbeciles-who are like famished jackals and have only the right to the crumbs. (p. 23) In the downfall of "Josy K, the singing streetsweeper," protagonist of La Liquidation de M. Joseph K, the troupe ironically comments on the entertainer's subjection to planned obsolescence in the consumer society. Joseph K's ruin also parodies the officially consecrated "theatre of the absurd." Stuffed into a garbage pail at the end of the play, ' Stated to me in a personal interview, 31 October 1972. 9 Six of Kraemer's plays have been published: Splendeur et misbre de Minette la bonne Lorraine (Paris, 1970); Le retour du Graully/La Farce du Graully (Paris, 1973); Les Immigrks (Paris, 1974); and La Liquidation de M.

Page numbers in this article refer to these texts.</page><page sequence="4">355 / THEATRE POPULAIRE DE LORRAINE Joseph K has only his material refuge in common with Samuel Beckett's Nag and Nell (Endgame). While they cannot escape a metaphysical void, Joseph K is a captive of the capitalist system. Of all the TPL's post-1968 plays, the first, Splendeur et miskre de Minette la bonne Lorraine, which denounces the region's iron trusts, comes closest both to real political muckraking and to touching the working-class public. This results not only from the nature of the play, but also from the conditions under which it was produced, for the play is both keystone and culmination of a much larger theatrical endeavor, Operation Minette. The events of May '68 proved to the troupe that popular theatre should not merely function by attracting the non-public but must go out to it: It is a question of touching the public where it lives with shows of the highest artistic quality, capable of treating its day-to-day concerns.' o Operation Minette, therefore, took the form of a theatrical crusade, with the Thieatre Populaire de Lorraine, financed by workers' organizations and popular associations, traveling to fifteen different mining towns in Lorraine in the spring of 1969. In each town, the actors provided a week of cultural animation consisting of poetry readings, conferences and short skits on the history of mining in Lorraine, the working conditions in the metallurgical industry, and the machinations of the iron trusts. One of its two thirty-minute warm-up skits, Parade pour Minette, shows how the troupe prepared the mining audience for the full-length play to be performed at the end of the week. To build up public interest in theatre, the TPL made the sketch as meaningful as possible by basing it on metallurgical history and literature. A chorus and the two main characters, a narrator and Minette, the personification of Lorraine's low-grade iron ore, recite authentic poems, chronicles and songs, and comment on Lorraine's iron industry. Performed in the streets or at union meetings, Parade pour Minette combines a glorification of the mining profession, an expose of exploitation and a call to arms. Mining is given a special magic, as, for example, in the recitation of the prose poem written by the miner Pierre Hemp: The steelworks are like the sky. Night embellishes them. From the ground to the mouths of the mighty furnaces, everything is aflame. Against these flames of fiery works, stars pale. Even the metaphorical Minette-"I change, I transform myself, I am different and I am always me! "-fascinates and excites. But interspersed with the positive poetic descriptions in increasing number are items which emphasize the miners' hardships. One such is the oppressive Vosges mining regulations of 1721: "For lodgings, one bed will service four workers. Of the four, there will always be two at work and two asleep. The bed will 10 "Le retour de T.P.L.," Metz, image de mois, magazine de l'agglomdration messine, janvier 1973, p. 29.</page><page sequence="5">356 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL therefore always be in use." Another is Victor Hugo's melodramatic portrait of the miner in A ubin: The miner is a nigger. Alas yes. In the mine, you go down, you go down, you sweat, you freeze, you cough, you are hot, you are cold. Death makes a big noise when it suddenly enters; it's like thunder. The final item, taken from Boris Vian's L 'Ecume des jours (Mood Indigo) chastizes the miner's resignation. Vian's engaging honeymooners, Chole and Colin, quip about the miners' obtuseness in accepting their outrageous working conditions. At this point in the performance, the actors turn to the audience and demand: "Are miners as stupid as Boris Vian's sweet characters believe? Are they incapable of organizing?" The audience is urged to respond to the provocation by joining the actors in singing the militant 1963 "Miners' Hymn." Parade pour Minette works directly on the miners' emotions. It engenders an enthusiasm for theatre by portraying the miner as a hero and transposing his preoccupations into drama. And by introducing Minette, the protagonist of both the montage and the full-length play, the warm-up sketch induces the audience to follow her story in the later production. Whereas Parade pour Minette raises the audience's ire against the practices of the iron trusts in general, Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine directs this anger against specific individuals and condemns the actual situation of the iron industry in Lorraine. A lexicon, published in the text and in the program notes, plainly identifies the fictional characters and imaginary locations as living persons, existing enterprises, and real sites. We read that the characters, "the Valley gangsters," represent the major industrial managers of the region: De Wendel, Usinor, Sidelor and Lorraine-Escaut: "The four trusts which in 1965 controlled the near-totality of iron mines and metallurgical industries." "The Chateau," the gangsters' base of operations, is identified as "the De Wendel family residence in Hayange (Moselle)." In addition, the technical terms and mining processes included in the lexicon are invested with a critical dimension. In the entry on "enrichment," for example, the process is not only defined but also commented on: Procedure which consists in increasing the ore content. Such a procedure includes, among other methods, flotation, levigation, and electromagnetic sorting. Enrichment plants are rare in Lorraine. The commentary subtly berates the iron industry for refusing to improve Lorraine's iron ore. The action of the play parallels the metallurgical history of the region and depicts the current crisis in the form of an allegorical satire. As such, the play functions on two levels. On one, that of reality, the play recounts the discovery of the low-grade Lorraine ore, called by the inhabitants of Lorraine, "minette," a pejorative term for both mine and mineral. The story traces the ore's exploitation by the major iron trusts and, finally, its rejection in favor of richer foreign loads. The subplot, on this level, deals with the government's relation to the industry.</page><page sequence="6">357 / THIATRE POPULAIRE DE LORRAINE The other, the fictional level, is an underworld story of a young, flirtatious girl, a "minette," who is discovered by the gangster, M. Joseph, head of a major prostitution ring. In the first part of the play, he uses her attributes to increase his power and gain control over the other mob chiefs, M. Roger and M. Tim. In the second part, however, he discovers she is not as profitable as the foreign "minettes" and has her murdered. Throughout both parts, the collusion between the Valley gangsters and the Parisian protection racket, "the Pigalle Gang," complicates Joseph's decisions. The French government's refusal to nationalize the iron mines is attacked in the play under the alias of "national pigallization." Both the character representing the head of state (the Corsican) and the Valley gangsters tremble at the thought of it: The practice of national-pigallization -the word makes me tremble-means the law of the jungle, a return to the Decline of the Roman Empire, to the time of the pharaohs, the Incas, the savages, the primitives. (p. 59) Instead of pigallization, the gangsters prefer to consolidate and move their operations out of Lorraine: "Our super-plant in the Marseilles suburbs is underway. We must progressively wipe out the valley factories" (p. 50). The real-life iron magnates have taken precisely the same action, moving their operations to Dunkerque and Fos-sur-Mer. These iron bosses are lampooned in the play through the grotesque portrayal of the gangsters, M. Joseph, M. Roger and M. Timothee, who swagger about the stage imitating gangster language and gestures. Whenever this facade crumbles, they rush about, bumping into each other, taking pratfalls and chattering nonsensically. Despite this innocuous aspect, they heedlessly ravage the land they control and destroy the people around them. The use of allegorical satire is hardly a new theatrical technique. Brecht employs it in his play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, to which Splendeur et misdre de Minette la bonne Lorraine owes both the inspiration for its milieu and its style. In Arturo Ui, Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his invasion of Austria are satirized as a gangster's take-over of the cauliflower trusts in Chicago and its suburb, Cicero. Rezvani also uses allegorical satire in his 1972 play, Capitaine Schelle, Capitaine Eg;o, which depicts the end of the capitalist world. Satyros Schelle and Sosso ECCo, who are accompanied by their respective wives, Eureka and Koukie, "the widow of President JoJo," and by their mistresses, Generia Motors and la Cavalcantopoulos, captain a luxury liner which goes adrift when their children desert the ship. The anthropomorphic crude oil, piped out of an underdeveloped nation and stored in the hold, then revolts, hangs the passengers and captures the ship. In the plays of Brecht and Rezvani, the "real world" remains outside the confines of the play. The actual subject must be grasped by making an intellectual leap between the allegorical figures and their real-life equivalents.'1 In the TPL's play, however, such an effort is unnecessary because signs from both the world of mining as well as from its allegorical transposition, the prostitution ring, are contained within the play's structure. The double meaning of the word "minette" (hip S' Brecht, however, explains the allegorical content in projections at the end of each scene which equate the on-stage action with Hitler's activity.</page><page sequence="7">358 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL chick and low-grade ore) makes possible a constant shifting back and forth from references to prostitution to mining concerns. At the beginning of each scene of the play, a newsboy runs on stage crying out the headlines of two newspapers: Spiciale Scandale, (slanted toward the prostitution element in the play) and Vallde-Magazine (geared to its mining aspect). Both papers, while maintaining the duality of Minette's story, use it for their own purposes. Speciale Scandale, for example, a tabloid, romanticizes M. Joseph's initial interest in Minette: "Surprise! Jo and A Poor Young Girl-the Idyl Begins." Vallee-Magazine, a trust-controlled daily, extols the benefits of exploiting Minette: "The most respected sources affirm-Minette assures valley's grandeur" (p. 13). In the action of the play, the visual imagery, behavior of the characters, constant double-entendres and word-play carry out the duality. A representative scene (Scene III) demonstrates this dualism. M. Joseph's gang, following his orders, kidnap Minette and bring her to the chateau. They are armed with machine guns (gangland prostitution) but manipulate the recalcitrant Minette with metallurgical instruments (mining world). Theo, Joseph's flunky, reports: "The lady isn't very cooperative" (p. 23)-that is, Minette refuses to join Jo's prostitutes, and the iron ore of Lorraine is not easily mined. Joseph, therefore, calls in his technician to "evaluate the sweetheart's possibilities" (p. 24)-as iron ore, as prostitute. The technician attempts a series of experiments to improve her quality but concludes: "This low-class product isn't marketable. You'll never turn her into a knock-out item." To this M. Joseph responds, "Well then I'll produce a 'minette!' " (p. 28)-Minette = a low-grade ore, a second-rate whore. The scene ends with le docteur Frensch, "Doc to my friends" (p. 30), plying Minette with whiskey (prostitution) and the Thomas pill (mining-a process discovered by Thomas Gilchrist to enrich iron ore). Although this combination of signs makes the censure of the iron trusts easily decipherable, the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine does not depend uniquely on allegorical satire to rally the mining audience to the anti-trust cause. There are more direct attempts to prompt the workers to action. In the second half of Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, the focus shifts from M. Joseph's exploitation of Minette to his exploitation of the workers and the allegorical terms barely veil reality. The workers, "the Valley families," characterized in the first half as apathetic employees in M. Joseph's "houses," become crucial to the action of the play even though they are never seen on stage. Their demands force M. Joseph to lose control of the situation momentarily: "You know yourself, Tim, that when the families say, 'the bosses can pay,' they're right" (p. 111). Indeed, despite the gangsters' final triumph with the murder of Minette, the play ends on a warning note from the Corsican: "Attention, some place in the world-families defeat gangsters-attention" (p. 115). The tragedy of Minette's assassina- tion is therefore balanced by the possibility of future action by the workers' movement in Lorraine. The repercussions from "Operation Minette" provide vivid proof of its political efficacy. The controlling interest in the iron mines applied enough pressure on the Office de Radiodiffusion-Television Franqaise to stop televised reports of the project, and persuaded the principal newspaper of Lorraine, L'Est Republicain to black out all coverage. After a second tour of Minette in 1970, the Metz municipality cancelled the troupe's subsidies and withdrew their theatre.</page><page sequence="8">359 / THEIATRE POPULAIRE DE LORRAINE The mining public's response was, as Nicole Zand noted in Le Monde (8 mars 1970), that "in cities where the TPL usually attracted fifty spectators, the theatres were full to bursting." In 1969 Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine was seen by nearly 11,000 spectators, 80% of them workers who had never before been to the theatre. Much later, when interviewed in a special 1970 television program on the problems of young theatre, one of these spectators summed up what he had learned from Operation Minette: "It isn't enough to bring in operas. Workers must be helped to discover theatre; they must be encouraged in order to be able to see themselves in what is performed."' 2 While having their political consciousness pricked, the working-class public who experienced Operation Minette discovered the relevance of theatre to their lives. In its second post-1968 production, La Liquidation de M. Joseph K, the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine turned to another problem threatening the population of Lorraine: economic liquidation. Although neither naming names nor pointing a finger at a specific organization, the TPL once again indicts the regional iron trusts, for the working and lower middle classes of the region face the possibility of bankruptcy from the pull-out of the iron industry. Furthermore, at the time of the play's creation, during the aftermath of Operation Minette, liquidation proceedings had just been initiated against the troupe itself.1 3 This fact adds a personal dimension to the story of Joseph K, a grocery store owner and symbolic victim, whose fate provides a comic parable of liquidation. The play comprises thirty-two vignettes. In the first two, a schoolmaster and an army sergeant predict Joseph K's inevitable doom. In the succeeding scenes, a banker, a lawyer, a process-server, a landlord, and a supermarket director seal it. Despite his work on the civic committee for small businesses, despite his labors in his own store, Joseph K cannot compete with the giant new supermarket, Gobkolos. Once liquidated, he never manages to hold another job and is bounced from the position of Gobkolos stocker to that of miner, nightwatchman, street sweeper, and finally, pop singer. He ends up in a garbage pail, consulting a computer about his future. But even the computer cannot help: "I am not programmed to answer that question" (p. 74). At the end of the play, the significance of the hostile universe which surrounds him is still a mystery. For the spectators, however, the play is a vivid illustration of monopoly capitalism. Rather than being an absurd anti-hero, a first cousin to his famous homologue, Joseph K clearly emerges as victim of both the Gobkolos (Grand Kapital) system and his own blindness. Presented as a typical schlemiel, Joseph K is uncomprehending, trod-on, and without a mind of his own. Indeed, a sexy feminine voice, identical to that of a department store intercom announcer, dictates his thoughts. Despite his encounter with a succession of liquidation agents, all the same in dress and manner, he remains completely ignorant of the economic forces that destroy him. Without an understanding of them, he can obviously never counter his economic oppression. Like La Liquidation de M. Joseph K, the third major production of the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine, Les Immigrds exposes to its audience an insidious process, racial 1 2 FranCoise Claire, "Thedtre, ch6mage, culture et revolution," Tribune Socialiste, 17 ddcembre 1970, p. 18. '3 Liquidation was averted by financial loans from other theatre troupes.</page><page sequence="9">360 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL prejudice, and more specifically how this prejudice effects immigrant workers. Of the four million immigrant workers employed in France, one million work in the Lorraine region. They have unfortunately become double victims of the region's economic depression, experiencing it both privately and, as the designated scapegoats for the indigent population's penury, publicly. While not forgetting to attack the iron industry which has caused the economic crisis, the play focuses on the racist ideas and attitudes held by all social classes. Of the sixteen sketches of the play, four chide the lower middle class and working class, five censure the middle class and five berate the upper middle class. As Colette Godard wrote in Le Monde (17 juin 1972), "The play exposes the different aspects of ordinary chauvinism, barely malicious, rarely aggressive, not even ideological, simply provoked by distrust and fear." To write the play, the troupe readopted the research techniques used for Operation Minette. They consulted specialists on the situation of immigrants in Lorraine and visited foreign workers in their homes. The TPL then presented the major themes which had evolved from their research in a half-hour montage before an immigrant audience. The final version of the play takes into account the immigrants' reactions and criticism. The form is that of the previous two plays of the TPL. However, while in them each sketch details part of a continuum (the history of Minette, the liquidation of Joseph K), in Les Immigrds each vignette examines a different aspect of prejudice. The first two debunk the mythology of the "savage native and noble white hunter" perpetrated in adventure movies of the 1940s, while others concentrate on such problems as the immigrants' working conditions and housing. The President Directeur General of a large business employing immigrants, for example, trots around the personnel office directing his staff with a polo stick, while professional philanthropists, guests of a television show on immigration, nearly kill each other vying for the most advantageous camera spot. Characters are allowed to talk until they expose themselves. A waitress exclaims "I am not a racist!" and then explains why she cannot allow immigrants in her cafe: "This is a select cafe. We can't serve just anybody. They can always go somewhere else" (p. 81). With a simple action added, the method attains the force of a fable. In one sketch the moral is that people do not apply to themselves the lessons they offer to others. A country grocer complains to a shopper that someone has stolen his chicken. She accuses the immigrants of the theft: "Theft is second nature to them." About to agree, the grocer notices a strange movement inside the woman's shopping bag and demands to search it. When the woman refuses, he forcibly opens it, finding, however, only her cat. The furious lady leaves in a huff promising never to return to the store and admonishing the grocer: "One shouldn't accuse without proof" (p. 43). Another sketch condemns police activity which, to divert attention from the real causes of the economic slump, incites the population against the immigrants. A frightened taxi-cab driver and a waiter arrive late at night at the former's home. While painting anti-immigrant signs, the cab driver has inadvertently knocked out the commissioner of police. His friend promises to help him surmount the delicate situation in return for a favor-a cut of the police anti-immigrant campaign payroll. As the cab driver has no other</page><page sequence="10">361 / THEATRE POPULAIRE DE LORRAINE recourse, he agrees: "I'll talk to the commissioner about it. I hope he didn't recognize me! Anyway you'll come with me just in case. You can testify that it was an error and that I didn't mean any harm" (p. 90). Both this sketch and that in the country store end with an ironic twist which fits into the general satirical scheme of the play. As in Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, the satire is given an allegorical dimension. The immigrants are never mentioned as such, but called "anthropomorphs" or "the animal with busy hands." By treating the foreign workers as mythical creatures, the play points out to what extent society has lost touch with reality in dealing with the immigrant situation. The immigrants are excluded from the myriad characterizations until the final scene of the play. When one finally appears, he is not only as much homo sapiens as his detractors but a far more dignified and personable man than his guignolesque boss. The latter, in a fit of paranoia, is attempting to flee from an imaginary immigrant plot to destroy him: "I don't feel at home here any more. And they do!" He cannot even start his car without his foreign chauffeur: "I don't know how to run this machine without him" (p. 93). This final vignette, like the last scene of Minette, serves as a warning. The audience must not ignore the fact that immigrants have become an essential part of society. The troupe's constant search for new ways to involve the regional public in its productions prompted a new dramatic approach in its fourth play, La Farce du Graully. After dramatically transposing three contemporary problems, in La Farce du Graully the troupe theatricalized an ancient regional myth and imbued it with a political message. The myth, which dates back to the fourth century A.D., tells how Saint Clement, sent by the Pope to evangelize the citizens of Lorraine, had first to win the people's confidence by freeing them from an enormous flying dragon, the Graully. To do so, he drowned the beast in the Moselle River, and consequently acquired the title of first bishop of Metz. For centuries the people of Metz celebrated Saint Clement's Day by parading an effigy of the Graully through the city streets. Although the parades have long been discontinued, the story remains dear to the inhabitants of Lorraine. The Theatre Populaire de Lorraine decided to produce their play in the streets of Metz. They built as their playing area a giant replica of the dragon, which was trucked from one quarter to another of the city and to the surrounding region. La Farce du Graully, like Operation Minette, went out to people who would not, through their own initiative, go to the theatre. Rather than dramatizing the myth exactly as it has been handed down, the TPL turns the legend on its head to illustrate the mechanism of capitalist power. The play designates Saint Clement as villain and the people (a shoemaker and his wife) as the real heroes of the story. The action begins when four medieval players escape from the stomach of the Graully where they have been imprisoned for a thousand years. They laugh and stare at the spectators and immediately engage the street audience in the dialogue, with such questions as "Where are we?" "What year is it?" They decide, at last,</page><page sequence="11">362 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL to perform for their new audience the farce they were acting out when swallowed by the monster. The farce presents the irreconcilable dilemma of Joseph and Berthe Jung. If they pay their taxes, they will starve. If they do not, they will be thrown in jail. They have only one chance to save themselves-to plead their case to the Governor. He, however, declares their effort futile, as the government is merely the agent for the real power, the Graully. Clement arrives from Rome just in time to volunteer his aid to the Jungs. He lays a trap in their home that evening while waiting for the Graully to come in person and collect the taxes. However, when faced with the beast, he flees in terror. In a fit of victorious laughter the Graully (actually the Governor in disguise) bumps his head, falls into the shoemaker's well, and drowns. A while later, Clement discovers the floating Graully and deceitfully proclaims himself conqueror of the dragon, saint, bishop of the city and, as the old Governor has disappeared, new ruler of Metz. The jubilant Jungs then appeal to their protector to release them from their payments, but instead he augments the sum by forty per cent. Having decided to sell his well as a last resort, Joseph is astonished to find in it not only the Graully disguise but also the Governor's body. Understanding at last both the Governor's ruse and Clement's trickery, he puts the costume to his own use by returning to the palace where he scares Clement into giving back the money to the people. The saint runs screaming off to Rome, chased by what he thinks to be "a ghost, a phantom Graully" (p. 103). This completes the play's demonstration: when power has no legitimacy because without a basis in reality, its holders have to invent a bogeyman. Lest the spectators think themselves free of danger, the medieval players once more address the audience to warn them that the Graully comes back every thousand years and is, therefore, due to return that very moment. And, indeed, the TPL's previous play has dealt with one contemporary bogeyman, the immigrant. The four post-1968 productions of the Theatre Populaire de Lorraine have evolved from agitation-propaganda techniques applied to a regional worker-management conflict to a parable whose comic structure indicts capitalism in a more general way.14 This evolution has come about not just because the TPL had to avoid another muckraking project such as Operation Minette if it wished to retain financial subsidies, but also because Kraemer feels that it is time to move from making a subject the starting point of a play to only gradually disclosing it. He describes this procedure when talking about the Graully plays: It was a question of allowing free reign to theatricality as capable in itself of engendering a subject; in other words, it is no longer a matter of translating meaning but of creating it.' s 4 In Kraemer's most recently produced play (Winter 1974), Le Retour de Graully, the evolution reaches a climax, for the play is as concerned with the nature of theatre as with the use of power (again symbolized in the Graully). The structure of the work attempts to reproduce dramatically the style of the nouveau roman.

The constants in the plays of the TPL link them, nevertheless, to the working class of the region. In Les Immigres, for example, the colors, red, blue, and yellow, are those of French construction sites. They and the symbolic metal props-a wrench is a phone and a toolbox a typewriter-clearly center the immigrant problem in the worker's world. In all there are myriad references to mining and metallurgy; and the troupe's theatrical language is chosen to appeal to the unsophisticated audiences of the region. Satire directs the audience's laughter to certain representative types (the big boss, the politician, the poor shopkeeper, the judge); parody and slapstick attack both the pretensions and the hypocrisy of the powerful. In their acting style, which they call "comic expressionism," the actors borrow from the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton, cabaret comedy, silent films and adventure movies. The sets are as broadly and purposefully designed as the characters. In Splendeur et misere de Minette la bonne Lorraine, for example, the decor of M. Joseph's chateau resembles the interior of a mine, underlining his use of machines for personal gain. His safe is actually a smelting furnace; his bar stools, mining benches; his executive chair, a combination of ore loader and driller. In La Liquidation de M. Joseph K, the gradual clearing away of all the props by the actors accompanies the realization of the moral bankruptcy of the protagonists and, moreover, represents the financial situation of the troupe. At the end of the play two actors, alone and out of costume, sit down disconsolately on the only remaining stage prop, a stage trunk, and wait. The music, like the acting, draws upon contemporary popular culture.16 A musical number like "The Song of the Eat-Everything Graully," for example, exhibits the naughtiness and vigor of popular songs such as "Alouette": The Graully gobbles the asses Of Metz's fair lasses The Graully sticks my lard With his dart so hard.' 7(p. 89) Moreover, while the lyrics of Joseph K's song "On Big and Little Business" reinforce the criticism of the capitalist system, its interpretation by a writhing actor to a background of guitar and drums recalls the best of Johnny Holliday "pop": Overblown stocks Accelerated rotation Government approval Fiscal Exoneration Gobkolos-Octopus For little business-monstrous 16 Except for Les Immigres, all the TPL's plays include at least three songs. La Farce du Graully has five.

In fact, there are no sympathetic protagonists at all. As characters played by other characters, Joseph and Berthe Jung are distanced from the spectators, while Joseph K and Minette are anti-heroes, reacting like mechanized dolls directed by forces outside their ken. In addition, with the single exception of the last scene in Les Immigres, no worker ever appears on stage. It is the presence of the workers in the audience that completes the structure of the performance. Just as Genet insists that there be at least one white person at whom a performance of The Blacks must be directed, so the workers must be at the performances of the TPL for the plays to have their full meaning. The real protagonist of the plays of the TPL is the audience itself. The spectators must draw their own conclusions from what they have seen. In understanding the lesson of the play, they are meant to see a way out of their own economic plight.
