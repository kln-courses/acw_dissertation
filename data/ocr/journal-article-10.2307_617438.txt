Compared with development in the study of medieval oriental chanceries, progress with respect to similar materials from the ancient Near East has been meagre. No paucity of archival documents, certainly, nor of editions culled for linguistic and historical purposes, but rather less evidence of concern with taxonomy and formal description. That could be due at least in part to lack of an appropriate vocabulary. Despite variation in components and order, there is an inevitable uniformity in the composition of chancery products and hence in their analysis. This characteristic of archival materials is what enabled Orientalists to transfer the methodology of European Urkundentehre to the study of Near Eastern chanceries, initially that of the Ottoman empire and eventually to those of the Arab and Persian states. The primary results was emergence of an agreed llescriptive lexicon: technical terms that could with fair accuracy be applied to documents of any period or provenance. For ancient Semitic texts such does not yet appear to be the case. To select but one instance of many, studies of Aramaic epistolo- graphy and other kinds of document exhibit a bewildering array of descriptive terms that makes overall comparison arduous. But relief is on the way: under the auspices of the Society of Biblical Literature members of an ' Ancient Epistolography Group ' (formed in 1974) have begun to publish the r0sults of their research, for Aramaic notably in RB, LXXXVI, 1979, 54G79 and LXXXIX, 1982, 528-75 (P. Dion, D. Pardee, J. Whitehead). After a preliminary study ( JBL 97, 1978, 321-46), these scholars have now produced a remarkably useful instrument de travatl for analysis of the earliest manifestations of the Hebrew letter The principal content of the Handbook are 48 epistolary and related texts preserved on ostraca and papyri from six sites: Meead Hashavyahu (l), Arad (22), Lachish (12), Murabba'at (8), Nahal Hever (4), and Nah. al Se'elim (1). The collection is thus chronologically concentrated in the seventh/ sixth centuries B.C.E. and the second century C.E., making a close diachronic analysis of epistolary form impossible but providing terminals for a number of judicious hypotheses (pp. 145-64). The texts themselves, save for the last five, have for some time been objects of close scrutiny, and Pardee's extrapolation of the results so far available is both sensitive and sober. It might only be said, in despite of the cost, a; study edition ' such as this would have been enhanced by the inclusion of plates. To the above corpus the editors have added the Phoenician letter from Saqqara (KAI No. 50), twelve fragments from the Bible and thirteen from Rabbinic literature (the latter assembled by S. Sperling). For description of the genre these addenda are significant in different ways: while the Phoenician document might be construed as evidence of a Canaanite epistolary tradition and via Ugarit of Akkadian influence, the Biblical and Rabbinic material provokes problems of source analysis quite separate from those appropriate to archaeo- logical and archival finds (see BSOAS, XLVI 1983, 540 ad Saldarini). At most they can be cited as attesting to the fact of letter writing and despatch, hardly to the continuity and/or development of formS which, of course, is the primary concern in comparative studies of diplomatic. Now, how are we served in respect of descriptive terminology ? Consonant with their preliminary essays (see above) the editors appear to have agreed upon a division of epistolary format into (1) praescriptio (intro- ductory formulae = address and greeting) (2) body (introduced by transition marker) and (3) closing formulae (= greeting and/or signatures). In this way and in due course a set of technical terms will be established. While these are admittedly adequate, it may not be too late to propose casting the net just a little more widely, with a view to incor- porating these materials into the general field of diplomatic. The standard reference is Bresslau's Hcmd bxch d er Urkund enlehre ( 1889/ 1911/1958), where (I, 47-8) are set out the components of a chancery document, since adapted to describe the products of medieval Islamic chanceries (e.g. BSOAS, XLVII, 1984 15 and refs. n. 13). Although it may be objected that this format is too elaborate for the ancient Near Eastern texts under dis- cussion here, the advantage of a uniform rocabulary ought to be obvious. It might further be claimed that while the debt of the medieval Muslim chancery to both form and substance of Roman law can be demonstrated such could hardly be maintained for the earlier material, and that furthermore, the ancient Hebrew texts are not invariably the formal issue of chanceries. To the first objection I would reply that even (perhaps especially) isolated elements benefit from a general description; to the second, that the products of polygenesis are of as much historical value as those of a demonstrated path of diffusion- and finally, that however eccentric the Hebrew texts may appear, the bulk of contemporary (Aramaic) and earlier (Ugaritic and Akkadian) documentation belongs to an established chancery tradition, and it is in relation to this that they must be assessed. The work of Pardee and his colleagues represents a major stride forward in that direction. J. wANssRouaH DANIEL CHANAN MATT (ed.): The Book of Mtrrors: Sefer Mar'ot ha-Zove'ot, by R. David ben Yehudah he-Hc6sid. (Brown Judaic Studies, 30.) xiv, [458] pp. Chico, California: Scholars Press, 1982. Practically every serious study of Kabba- listic material undertaken in the last fifty years or so begins with Scholem. The present enterprise, a critical edition of an early fourteenth-century work, is no exception. The editor, Daniel Matt, is fully aware of this. In the preface he refers to a letter which Scholem</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 337 addressed to H. N. Bialik, the Hebrew National Poet, in 1925, at the beginning of what was to become his lifetime work in this field. In it Scholem outlined a programme for research in Kabbalah to be completed, as he hoped (with the aid of ' a team of assistants ' which never materialized), within the following two decades. He died two years ago having accom- plished an astonishing number of his original goals but leaving many (most notably, perhaps, the dictionary of the Zohar which he described in this letter as half-finished; it has been reputed to exist in index-card form for many years but was never published) to future generations of scholars. The publication of the writings, at that time not yet fully identified, of R. David ben Yehudah he-Hasid was one of the items on Scholem's list of desiderata addressed to Bialik in 1925. By 1928 (G. G. Scholem in Ktrjath-Sefer, 4, 1927-28, 302-27) he had made important preliminary steps towards identifying the full body of writings which can be confidently ascribed to R. David, and substantiated his earlier claim that the works of this particular Kabbalist are crucially important for Zohar criticism in that they are the first to be heavily dependent on the Zohar, as well as presenting the first transla- tions of whole sections of the Aramaic Zohar into Hebrew. Scholem was, of course, at that time concerned to prove the antiquity of the Zohar against the rumours which had been circulating for centuries since the sudden ' discovery ' of the ' Zohar literature ' in the late thirteenth century, that this allegedly Tannaitic work was in fact fabricated by the thirteenth-century Spanish Kabbalist Moshe de Leon. These rumours were promoted by all those who, for a variety of apologetic reasons through the ages, were extremely hostile to the Kabbalah, and it is understandable that Scholem, singlehandedly out to redeem the discipline from undignified obscurity, was determined to dispel them once and for all and to establish the Zohar, and the Kabbalah, as a legitimate and integral part of the Jewish tradition. Some years later he managed brilliantly to prove the opposite, namely, that the ' Zohar literature' is, essentially, a book, and that R. Moshe de Leon was, after all, its thirteenth-century author. That he succeeded nevertheless in investing the subject with academic respectability ancl establishing its legitimacy within the tradition (and there are some who claim that he has over-reached his mark) is a measure of his extraordinary insight and overwhelming intellectual force. Since Scholem published his preliminary observations in the late 1920s, some additional details concerning the identity of R. David, his literary inheritance and the main sources of influence on his work have emerged, largely through the investigations of E. Gottlieb, M. Idel and the present editor. Scholem established beyond doubt that R. David was a Spanish scholar and that his writings are imbued with the distinctive symbolism of the Spanish Kabbalah. Until then it was some- times thought that, as his name David ben Yehudah he-Hasid suggested, he was des- cended from the twelfth-century German mystic Yehudah he-Hasid. References in one of his works to Judeo-German liturgical practice appeared to give some support to this notion. It is clear, however, that his father was a later, probably Spanish, Yehudah the Pious, and that his familiarity with Ashkenazi custom derived only from his travels through the Rhineland. On the basis of explicit state- ments to this effect in an Oxford MS attributed to R. David which deals with the Kabbalistic secrets of the Hebrew alphabet, Scholem con- cluded that R. David was the grandson of Nahmanides, the leading Spanish Bible esegete and Kabbalist of the preceding generation. But, as D. Matt reports, it now seems this may not be so after all. XEiCfraim Kupfer who has studied the works of the later, Bohemian scholar and Kabbalist, Yom Tov Lipmann hIuelhausen, has identified the manuscript in question as a copy of one of Muelhausen's tracts, falsely attributed to R. David by a scribe who also interpolated the ' biographical ' passages which linked R. David with Nah- manides. This link, a tradition which was clearly upheld by the anonymous scribe, should still be noted and is attested elsewhere, but Daniel Matt in his introduction to The Book of Slirrors rightly leaves open the question of its authenticity. R. David's surviving corpus of writings ras in the main identified and described by Scholem. Subsequently, additional AISS of his Zohar translations have been located by Idel (see M. Idel, Alei Sefer, Nos. 8-10, 198S 81), and while the treatise on the secrets of the alphabet described by Scholem was not written by R. DavidS as we have seen, both Gottlieb and Idel have identified him as the genuine author of a number of short tracts on the same subject (Idel, loc. cit., E. Gottlieb, MeAqarim be-Sifrut ha-Qabbalah, Tel-Aviv, 1976, 249-50). Most of these works, written probably in the beginning of the fourteenth century, reflect the strong influence of R. Moshe de Leon and the Zohar as well as that of other Spanish Kabbalists of the thirteenth century. Daniel Matt confirms Scholem's observation that the main Kabbalistic sources used by R. David in The Book of Mirrors (usually without acknowledgment, of course) were the writings of Ezra and Azri'el of Gerona, Todros Abulafia, Moshe de Leon and his own contemporary, Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi (the author of the commentary on Sefer Yezzrah traditionally ascribed to R. Abraham ben David [of Posquieres]). He makes one important addition: R. David draws heavily also from the book Shiarei Orah by Joseph Gikatilla, a contemporary of R. Moshe de Leon who, like R. David, was one of the earliest translators of Zohar texts into Hebrew and whose dependence on de Leon and his works, a question first explored by Scholem, is currently being re-evaluated.l Danie] Matt 1 See, for example, A. Altmann, ' Sefer Or Zaru'a le-Rabbi Moshe de Leon', in Kobez Al Yad, IX (XIX), 1980, 23540; A. Farber, ' Iqvotav shel Sefer ha-Zohar be-Kitrei R. Yosef Giqatilah ', Alei Sefer, 9, 1981 * idem, ' Keta Hadash me-Hakdamat R. Yoseph Gikatilla le-Sefer Ginat Egoz ', Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought (Heb.), 1, 1981.</page><page sequence="3">338 REVIEWS points out that in translating whole sections of the Zohar and incorporating them into his own work without acknowledgment, in deleting certain passages while interpolating his own comments as well as borrowing the style and narrative framework of the Zohar to introduce his own or other Spanish Kabbalists' ideas, R. David does not appear to be treating the Zohar as an ancient, canonical Tannaitic source but rather as a recent Kabbalistic work of which he makes free use in much the same way as he avails himself of the writings of his near-contemporaries. Like a number of Spanish Kabbalistic works of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, and indeed, the Zohar itself, ' The Book of Mirrors is punctuated with a tone of urgency . . . R. David is eager to transmit what he can express and what he feels permitted to reveal ' (Introduction, p. 19). D. Matt sets this urgency in the context of the heightened consciousness of the need to expound the secret meaning of existence which was generated by the appearance of the Zohar a decade or two earlier. Clearly, this new licence to engage in mystical exegesis, and the in- tensified communication of esoteric material which resulted from it, took effect only within the closed ranks of expert Kabbalistic scholars, but they were none the less inspired with a sense of mission to the nation as a whole. Already the Ra'aya Meheimna and the Tikkunes Zohar, written anonymously shortly after the Zohar in imitation of its style and incorporated into it in most editions of the work, had linked the appearance of the Zohar with the final revelation of mvsteries which marked the dawning of the age of Redemption. The question is, how did the Kabbalists of this period conceive of Redemption ? Scholem regarded the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 as the dividing line between the essentially non-messianic, individualized, notion of Redemption characteristic of the pre-expulsion period, and the Kabbalah of the sixteenth century, primarily of the Lurianic school, which placed messianic Redemption, as a climactic external manifestation of internal cosmic ' restoration ', at the centre of its concerns. A recent study by Y. Liebes, ' ha-Mashi'ah shel ha-Zohar ' in The Messianic idea in Jewish tholbght (Heb.), Jerusalem, 1982, 87-236, has attempted to modify this view, . . . . . . c ilscernmg messlanlc preoccupatlons ln a certain section of the Zohar (the two Idrot) which, according to his interpretation, depicts the alleged author and ' hero ' of the Zohar, R. Shim'eon bar Yohai, as a messianic figure analogous and mystically linked to the figure of Moses, the first and last redeemer, as well as the actual author of the work, R. Moshe de Leon himself. This interpretation detects acute messianic tension in the circle of de Leon's immediate associates, and observes the merging of traditional apocalyptic eschatology with spiritualized mystical messianism at the end of the thirteenth century in much the same way in which Scholem had presented the two varieties as merging for the first time in the sixteenth century. Against the back- ground of this provocative suggestion, it is interesting to observe R. David's complete indifference to the messianic undertones which may be present in one of his main sources of inspiration. This is particularly evident in another of his works, Sefer ha-Gevul (see Scholem, op. cit., 307-10), which is a com- mentary on the Idra Rabba of the Zohar, one of the texts which Liebes reads messianically. R. David ignores the narrative setting of the Idra (where Liebes locates the most forceful expression of the messianic import of the text) and proceeds to expound the chain of Divine emanations without any reference to Redemp- tion. (Liebes notes this himself; see op. cit., 103.) The Book of Mirrors' non-messianic in- tent is underlined by R. David's resort to the theory of Cosmic Cycles (Shemitot, pp. 102-9 of the text and section 3.9, pp. 31-3 of the Introduction) which, while common in thir- teenth-century Spanish Kabbalah, is totally absent from the Zohar. It conceives of the world as undergoing cycles of creation, each lasting 6000 years, and returning to chaos every seventh (sabbatical-Shemitah) millen- nium, a theory which is far removed from the notion of linear progress through history culminating with the messianic event. The editor's introduction to The Book of Mirrors, neatly divided into sections, pro- gresses from bio-bibliographical considerations to the identification and analysis of aspects of R. David's teaching that are original or at least distinct from the Zohar and all the other Kabbalistic sources on which he drew so extensively. To the biographical sketch, which malies the most out of the scanty evidence available, one can add the information brought to light by Idel in a series of articles about R. David and his circle,2 from which he emerges, rather than a solitary mystic, as an established teacher of Kabbalah, surrounded by colleagues and students who prompt him to reply in writing to their questions on technical Kabbalistic matters. Idel published two such Kabbalistic responsa by R. David (in Daat, 4, 1980, 41-2 and Jersalem Studies, II/2, 194-6). Furthermore, Idel suggests a continuity of R. David's distinct Kabbalistic school via generations of disciples right through the fourteenth century if not even later, exerting influence on the Safed circle of the sixteenth century and serving as the direct source for some of the most famous and widely accepted features of the Lurianic Kabbalah.3 To single 2 Idel, loc. cit.; idem, ' The image of man above the Sefirot ' (Heb.), Daat, 4, 1980, 41-55; tdem, ' Kabbalistic materials from the School of Rabbi David ben Yehudah he- Hasid ' (Heb.), Jerqbsalem Studies tn Jewish Thought, II/2, 1982/3, 169-207.

Yehudah he-Hasid ve-ha-ARI ', Daat, 7, 1981, 69-71. D. Matt is clearly familiar with all these works yet he seems to underplay Idel's con- clusions regarding R. David's impact on the Kabbalah of his time and after. One wonders whether he has reservations on this point or</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 339 out one or two examples, R. David develops in The Book of Mirrors the notion of the ten ZaAzakot-' dazzling lights that precede the emanation of the Sefirot ' (Introduction, p. 23). Idel has pointed out the anthropomorphic structure of these ' Sefirot which lie above the Sef rot ', suggested their gnostic origin and demonstrated the connexion between them and Luria's concept of Adam Kadmon (Idel Daat, 4). Similarly, the Lurianic notion of Parzm-the anthropomorphic configurations (literally-' faces ') of ten Sefirot which become the manifestations of Adslm Kadmon in the world of ' restoration ' ( Tikkun), can be shown to derive from a similar usage in The Book of Mirrors (Idel, Daat, 7). The publication of this work in the present edition is, therefore, important, not only because it sheds light on the Zohar and its circle, as Scholem had recognized, but also because it makes accessible for the first time a major work by a man who has begun to emerge as an important and influential Kabbalist in his own right, heading a circle of Kabbalists which seems to constitute the ' missing link ' in the history of the Kabbalistic tradition between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries (see Idel, Jerusalem Studies, II/2, 206). The edition is based on sound scholarship. It is an adaptation of the editor's 1978 doctoral dissertation at Brandeis University, an institution from which a number of im- portant Kabbalistic studies have emanated in recent years and which has formed, under the supervision of Alexander Altmann, the only centre (since the death of George Vajda in Paris) for the serious study of the Kabbalah outside Israel. The introduction, though compact and somewhat limited in scope (con- fining the analysis of R. David's Kabbalah to The Book of Mirrors alone, to the virtual exclusion of his other works) is extremely lucid. The section on the title of the book (2.4, pp. 8-10) is an excellent example of this: it isolates the various complex traditions which underly the Hebrew title (literally-a phrase taken from Exodus 38: 8 which the King James version translates as ' the looking glasses of the women assembling [... at the door of the tabernacle] ') and justifies fully the editor's response to the near-impossible task of finding an English equivalent, even though at first sight it seemed to sacrifice too much of the familiar flavour of the original. Occa- sionally the language of discourse, especially the translations into English, seems to read like a science fiction script ('. . . a raid on the riches of emanation: the outside forces snatch and grab the flow from the paths [of the sefirot] . . .', p. 31), but then the material does rather lend itself to this mocle and may in turn have inspired some recent output in the genre. One cannot conclude w-ithout lamenting (alas, in vain) the abominable and prevalent practice of separating the critical notes from the text by tucking them away at the enci of the book. Tiresome in a11 cases, this method whether he is simply not concerned with any- thing which is not directly related to the text he has edited. is especially inappropriate for the publication of critical editions of highly technical texts such as the present volume. The full weight of original scholarship lies mainly in the notes. Their location makes this book extremely unwieldy. AVA RAPOPORT-ALBERT WARREN C. TREXCHARD: Ben Sira s view of eaomen: cz literar?y analysis. (Bro+X7n Judaic Studies, 38. j x, 341 pp. Chico, California: Scholars Press, 1982. $15.75. Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus Ben Sirach, provides a unique resource for the student of wisdom literature as well as for those interested in the intellectual and social currents operative in the Jewish community at a time when the Hebrew Bible sra.s assuming its final form and when Jewish religio-cultural patterns were being challenged and reshaped by the confrontation ^ith Hellenism. Ancient wisdom materials are notoriously difficult to classify or understand in terms of genre and purpose, with their characteristic lack of chronological and contextual markers con- tributing in no small measure to this problem. Ben Sira stands as a remarkable exception: the date of composition can be reasonably well fixed (to the early second century B.C.E.); the author himself is known by name; and his personal interests and experiences can be glimpsed from internal evidence in his book, which is preserved in Greek and in reliable Hebrew portions from ancient and medieval times. One noteworthy aspect of Ben Sira's sagacious counsel, which covers a wide range of human activities and social situations, is his attention to females. As Trenchard points out in this xlJork, which is a slightly revised edition of his University of Chicago doctoral thesis, about 7 per cent of the 1390 verses in Sirach deal with women. The quantitative signifi- cance of this material certainly justifies a study of Ben Sira's treatment of women. Precisely because wisdom literature in general contains the frequent, although poorly understood usage of female imagery and because this specific apocryphal example of wisdom can be con- textually located, the contributions of such an analysis would indeed be significant. Unfortu- nately, this potential is not fulfilled, perhaps because the author has defined his goals in too narrow a fashion. Trenchard has seized upon the opposing claims of the few existing studies of women in Sirach, namely, that either Ben Sira was personally antagonistic towards women or that his attitude tovards women is negative only insofar as he reflected contemporary society, and has set out to resolve the issue about the nature of Ben Sira's view of women. Adopting the former position as his working hypothesis, he performs the valuable task of producing a careful textual and tradition-compositional analysis of all the passages which deal with females directly or which divulge in some way the ancient author's thinking about females. To do so, he has organized the appropriate</page></plain_text>
