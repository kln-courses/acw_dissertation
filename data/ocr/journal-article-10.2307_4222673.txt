The green woodpecker (Picus vir- idis) is described as being closely bound to cultivated land and deciduous forests, mainly due to its summer di- et composed of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) found on meadows and pastures. To explore possible responses of this woodpecker to recent changes in land use prac- tice, we studied home ranges, feeding habitats and food selection of a marginal population (four radio-marked males and five females) in a 30,000-ha conifer-dominat- ed landscape at the northern edge of its distribution range in south-central Scandinavia. We asked: (1) Is the green woodpecker confined to areas with cultivated land and deciduous forest? (2) If so, are important food items (ants) particularly abundant or exclusively found there? (3) Can clearcuts and young plantations substitute for cultivated land as feeding habitat? Home ranges (mean=100 ha) were invariably confined to the parts of the landscape that contained cultivated land (&lt;1% of the total area). In summer, birds preferred to feed in cultivat- ed land, presumably due to a higher overall biomass of ants compared to forest habitats. They avoided clearcuts, but preyed extensively upon soil-dwelling ants in young conifer stands (16-30 years old). We failed to find pref- erences for particular ant groups (Lasius niger and L. flavus) associated with cultivated land. The principal summer food was Serviformica, an ant group that was equally abundant in cultivated land and forest habitat. A positive correlation between ant body mass and a prefer- J.

In winter, birds fed exclusively on mound-building Formica rufa-ants in closed-canopy, older forest stands. Our results indicate that the green woodpecker successfully utilizes young conifer plantations as feeding habitat. At a larger scale, we hypothesize that green woodpecker populations fail to establish in managed forest tracts, not because of food shortage, but because the landscapes lack cultivated land serving as a key stimulus encouraging individuals to settle. Key words Picus viridis . Hierarchical habitat selection Landscape scale · Land use changes Boreal forests Introduction Having dispersed, an animal potentially has the choice of where to settle, and the behaviour involved in this pro- cess is usually described as habitat selection (Hunting- ford 1984). Many animals do not occupy their entire po- tential range even though they could disperse into the unoccupied areas. Thus individuals choose not to live in certain habitats, and the distribution of a species may be limited by the behaviour of individuals selecting their habitat. Habitat selection might occur in response to food alone, if food differs predictably among habitats (Verer 1975). Factors related to predation risk, such as the openness or denseness of the habitat, may provide ad- ditional cues that facilitate selection (Hild6n 1965; Bechard 1982; Wywialowski 1987). Although the rela- tive importance of innate and learned elements in habitat selection is unknown, the behavioural mechanisms ap- pear to have a large inherited component, which is sub- ject to some modification by learning (Klopfer 1963; Wecker 1964; Klopfer and Hailman 1965; Wiens 1972; Partridge 1974, 1978). The genetic basis of habitat selec- tion is probably responsible for a slow response by some birds to anthropomorphic changes in the environment. Habitat selection can be envisaged as a hierarchical spatial process, from choice of home range to choice of Oecologia (2000) 124:116-129 © Springer-Verlag 2000</page><page sequence="2">117 dietary item (Hild6n 1965; Johnson 1980; Senft et al. 1987; Orians 1991; Schaefer and Messier 1995). A vari- ety of environmental cues may be adopted by an organ- ism as the proximal stimulus in decision making at each spatial scale. Whereas landscape patterns and terrain forms may be important in selecting a home range for dispersing young birds, nest and feeding sites may be crucial when choosing among different habitat compart- ments within the home range. The occurrence of food and shelter for predators may be instructive when decid- ing on which habitat patches to use and not use in daily life. Although habitat selection in birds has been studied in more detail than in most other animal taxa, it remains a poorly understood ecological process, especially at the scale of home ranges and landscapes. The green woodpecker is described as being closely bound to cultivated land and deciduous forests (Conrads 1968; Haftorn 1971; Blume 1981; Cramp 1985). The af- finity for these habitats is thought to be related to its summer diet, consisting mainly of adult and pupal ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) found on meadows and pas- tures (Skott 1971; De Bruyn et al. 1972; Lohrl 1977; Blume 1981; Cramp 1985). Over the last four to five de- cades, extensive changes have taken place in the Scandi- navian landscape. More intensive farming, emphasizing cereal production has lead to a decrease in the amount of meadows and pastures (Statistiska CentralbyrAn 1984; Statistisk Sentralbyra 1990). Concurrently, a shift in for- est harvest practice, from selective tree cutting to clear- cutting, along with reforestation of previous cultivated land, has increased the amount of young coniferous plan- tations (Norsk institutt for jord-og skogkartlegging 1982/1983; Institutionen for skogstaxering 1987). Nilsson et al. (1992) suggest that this loss of suitable habitat ex- plains a decrease in the green woodpecker population in Sweden. The general notion that the green woodpecker is con- fined to cultivated land and deciduous forest has been questioned by Petersen (1945), who found the green woodpecker in Denmark to have responded positively to an increased proportion of conifer trees (mainly Norway spruce Picea abies) from planting, and to be able to breed in coniferous forest as well. Sharrock (1976) even suggested that the green woodpecker might benefit from clearcutting forestry, which creates more suitable habi- tats for open-dwelling ants. This means that new habitats resulting from moder forestry may substitute for the loss of meadows and pastures. The Picus genus, including a dozen Asian species, presumably originated in oriental broad-leaved forests (Short 1982). Except for the grey-faced woodpecker (Picus canus), none of the species are regarded as regu- lar inhabitants of boreal forests (Salomonsen 1930; Cramp 1985; Winkler et al. 1995). Selection of habitat can be attributed to origin in the sense that birds choose environments similar to the region in which the species originated (Hild6n 1965). Conditions in different parts of the range of a species may, depending on its ability to adjust to changes, lead to geographical variation in habi- tat selection. Individuals may possess an internal image or template of what constitutes suitable habitat (Thorpe 1963; Wiens 1985). Habitats that fit the template provide various cues - e.g. habitat structure and food resources - that may lead an individual to settle in an area (Svardson 1949; Hilddn 1965; James 1971; Cody 1981; Wiens 1989; Orians and Wittenberger 1991). To explore possible responses of the green woodpeck- er to changes in land use due to agriculture and forestry, we studied home ranges, feeding habitats and food selec- tion patterns of a population at the northern edge of its range in south-central Scandinavia. A closer look at the basis of the common assumptions about this woodpecker reveals that most of the studies undertaken, although valuable in terms of descriptions of habitat and diet, have not taken into account resource availability. Fur- thermore, earlier studies have mainly been conducted in the central European part of the distribution range (Skott 1971; De Bruyn et al. 1972; Lohrl 1977; Blume 1981; Cramp 1985). Paying special attention to the location of the study area, situated in a boreal forest with scattered meadows and old pastures, the following questions were asked: (1) Is the green woodpecker actually confined to areas with cultivated land and deciduous forest? (2) If so, are important food items particularly abundant or ex- clusively found there, explaining an affinity for these habitats? (3) Can clearcuts and young plantations substi- tute for cultivated land as feeding habitat? The birds were monitored both in summer and winter to detect sea- sonal shifts in diet and habitat use. We addressed the is- sue at three spatial scales: (1) selection of home ranges within the landscape; (2) selection of feeding sites within home ranges, and (3) selection of food items (ants) with- in feeding sites. Material and methods Study area The study was carried out during 1991-1995 in a 30,000-ha coni- fer-dominated forest landscape, the Varaldskogen Research Area, on both sides of the Norwegian-Swedish border in Hedmark and Warmland counties (Fig. 1). The area belongs to the middle boreal zone (60°10' N, 12o30' E) (Ahti et al. 1968). The topography is fairly flat with gentle hills and valleys between 200 and 400 m above sea level. Climate is moderate continental with a mean tem- perature of the warmest month (July) of 16.2°C and -7.3°C in the coldest (January). Yearly mean precipitation is 613 mm, and the ground is normally covered with snow from mid-November to April-May. Average snow depth for January-March during the last decade was 30 cm (max. 100 cm). The winters of 1991-1992 and 1992-1993, when most of our winter habitat data were col- lected, were unusually mild, with long periods of snow-free ground. Maximum snow depth recorded during the course of the study was 70 cm (Rolstad and Rolstad 1995). The forest is dominated by Scots pine (Pinus silvestris) and Norway spruce admixed with a small proportion of birch (Betula spp.), aspen (Populus tremula), alder (Alnus incana) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). The primeval forest was regenerated by fire, but fire has been successfully suppressed over the last 100 years. The forest has been utilized for timber harvest for at least 400 years. Selective cutting methods prevailed up to the 1950s, giving rise to a multilayered, all-aged stand structure.

The dominating ground layer is bilber- ry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and heather (Calluna vulgaris), but the clearcutting favours grasses and herbs. A more detailed descrip- tion of vegetation types, forest history and stand structure is re- ported elsewhere (Rolstad et al. 1988, 1998; Rolstad and Wegge 1989a, 1989b). Patches of human-influenced habitats were scat- tered throughout the landscape and constituted 0.8% of the total study area. The largest continuous area with pasture and meadow was 10 ha in size (Fig. 1C). Animal husbandry was commonly practised up to the 1950-1960s and the animals grazed in the for- ested areas during the summer months. Today the total number of livestock counts less than 50 animals and the grazing impact on forest habitats is negligible. Census and radio-tagging All holes considered large enough for the green woodpecker (n=200; including black woodpecker Dryocopus martius holes) were searched for roosting birds in 1992 and 1993. During these years, playback of green woodpecker vocal calls and drumming was used to localize birds in spring prior to breeding. The other years (1991, 1994 and 1995), a smaller proportion of the holes were checked and playback was used only occasionally. Thus, in 1992 and 1993 we most probably surveyed all green woodpeckers in the study area, whereas we may have missed some in the other years. Nine adult birds (four males and five females) were radio- tagged and relocated 285 times between September 1991 and Sep- tember 1994. In addition, five unmarked adults (two breeding pairs and a single male) were observed (Table 1). Two juvenile birds were radio-tagged in autumn, but they dispersed out of the study area later the same autumn. The birds were captured at roosting or nest holes with a hoop net on a telescoping pole, and fitted with 7-g (including harness) back-mounted radio-tags (Bio- track, UK). Neck and wing harnesses were made of nylon encased in silicon rubber (Brander 1968). Average transmitting distance C 5 km N ; 7 2 , · ,,, 34 6 i was 2 km, reduced to 300 m in rough terrain. Batteries lasted 3 months and radio-tags were replaced whenever it was possible to recapture the birds. The transmitters constituted 2.9-3.3% of the body weight, and there were no indications of adverse effects of the radio-harness. Population structure and dynamics Two males were located and radio-tagged in the autumn of 1991, but because a large proportion of the area was not surveyed, other birds were most probably present at that time. During the com- plete survey of 1992, we recorded three breeding pairs, compris- ing a breeding density as low as one pair per 10,000 ha (Table 1, Fig. 1C). The population was small and unstable as shown by the fact that the next year, in 1993, no new birds recruited and no breeding attempts were recorded, despite a thorough search in the whole study area. We also recorded telemetric evidence that four of the five radio-marked females migrated out of the study area af- ter breeding or breeding attempts in spring and early summer (Ta- ble 1). Although we did not survey the whole area thoroughly in 1994 and 1995, we feel confident in concluding that the study area supported a marginal population of green woodpeckers. In total, six breeding attempts were recorded, of which four were successful. One nest was abandoned due to the activity of a wasp nest in a neighbouring hole, whereas the other was predated by pine marten (Martes martes) as revealed by hair remains in the entrance hole. The four successful breedings produced five, six, six and seven fledglings, indicating an overall high production and nestling survival. All nests were in aspen trees, and there was no indication that the availability of suitable nest trees was limiting. Three nests were situated in semi-open cultivated land, two were in old spruce forests, and one was in the middle of a large clearcut that was adjacent to several houses surrounded by lawns. During the course of the study (2,422 telemetry bird-days) we recorded only one bird being predated (female 3b predated by a raptor). We lost contact with two males in summer without evidence of long distance movement out of the study area, and these might have </page><page sequence="4">C-. X 0 c. C: :.

Overall, adult mortality was fairly low, and it seemed subordinate to long-distance movement out of the study area in determining the population dynamics. Home range and habitat We located the birds with a portable receiver and approached them to ascertain visually the type of (1) activity (resting, feeding) and (2) habitat within a 10-m radius of the observation site. Observa- tions and radio-fixes were marked on forest company maps (scale 1:10,000), featuring forest stand characteristics at a precision of 0.1 ha. In the habitat analyses, we used only sites where feeding was recorded, assuming these represented birds undisturbed by our presence. At the feeding sites we noted habitat type (forest, cultivated land), forest stand age (dominating trees) and tree spe- cies composition (spruce, pine and deciduous trees in 10% class- es). Data on habitat availability were extracted from the forest company maps and corrected in the field for recent logging activi- ties. Habitats were analysed separately for summer (May-September) and winter (October-April) seasons, defined according to clear shifts in the diet composition in spring and autumn. Home ranges were delineated by drawing a polygon between the outermost ra- dio-fixes, including the nest and roosting sites (Mohr 1947). Sea- sonal home ranges were based on 16-41 radio-fixes. No correla- tion was found between the size of the area used and the number of radio-fixes upon which it was based (Spearman rank correlation test; rs=-O.10, P&gt;0.20, n=10). Habitat selection was examined at two spatial scales: the habi- tat composition of the feeding sites was compared with that of the home ranges, which in turn were compared with the habitat com- position of the total study area. Availability of habitats within the home ranges was obtained by drawing a circle, with a radius de- termined by the outermost radio-fix, around the intersecting point of the mean x- and y-coordinates of the set of radio-fixes. A circle was found to represent available habitats more appropriately than the actual home range because the green woodpecker density was low, resulting in large vacant areas between the home ranges (Fig. 1C). Hence, we assumed that birds were free to choose habitats in- dependent of neighbouring birds. Telemetry fixes were more widely distributed within winter ranges than in summer ranges. Therefore, we weighted the available habitats according to the proportion of fixes within successive 500-m circles around the centre of the set of the fixes. The number of feeding sites of each bird was too small to explore individual variation in habitat selec- tion. Therefore, we weighted the proportion of habitat components in each bird's home range by the respective number of feeding sites. The pooled dataset of home range composition resulting from this calculation was then used in the availability-utilization analyses based on the total number of feeding sites as sample size. At the landscape level, we compared the habitat composition of each green woodpecker locality with the habitat composition of the total study area. An occupied locality was defined as the resi- dent site of breeding pairs or single adult birds. Localities were delineated by drawing a circle with a 1-km radius around the arith- metic centre of the set of telemetry-fixes from both male and fe- male. Eight localities were selected, with two of them counted twice due to recruitment and settlement of new birds (Table 1, Fig. IC). New birds may have settled in the locations due to conspecif- ic attraction rather than habitat suitability. However, the conclu- sions drawn from the analyses at this level of spatial scale did not change if the twice-counted localities were counted once. Green woodpecker localities covered 6% of the total study ar- ea. Based on the hypothesis that cultivated land was preferred hab- itat, we assessed the expected probability that a location contained cultivated land by drawing out 50 1-km-radius circles randomly from a 500x500-m grid net. Any cultivated land larger than 0.1 ha was counted. We also tested whether there were unoccupied areas with suitable habitat by selecting eight of the randomly chosen 1-km circles, non-overlapping and with the highest coverage of cultivated land, and comparing these with the habitat composition of the eight occupied localities (Fig. 1C).

Diet and prey selection We collected bird droppings at feeding sites, from roosting holes and from nests after the brood fledged. The chitinous parts of the ants could be identified in the excreta and the frequency of occur- rence of the different ant groups was determined by counting their head capsules using a binocular microscope. Based on their ecolo- gy and general appearance, we categorized the ant species into eight groups: the Serviformica group, the Formica rufa group, the Lasius niger group, the L. flavus group, the Camponotus group, and the Myrmica-Leptothorax group (Table 2). Identifications fol- lowed keys of standard reference works (Collingwood 1979; Douwes 1981a, 1981b, 1995; Seifert 1996). Ant pupae occurred in droppings from the summer months. Because they were partly dis- solved, and because they could not be identified to ant group, we omitted them from the analysis. Ant eggs and larvae could not be identified. To assess the density and biomass of ants available to green woodpeckers in summer, grids of 10x10 m were established in ar- eas where feeding had been recorded (forest n=19; clearcuts n=8; cultivated land n=9). The number of colonies was counted and the number of ants in each colony was estimated by digging up all colonies in soil, humus and very rotten woods. Ant numbers were visually assessed at the site by carefully observing the colony dur- ing excavation. A sample of 11 colonies, spanning the range of 10-500 estimated individual ants, were brought to the laboratory, frozen at -18°C, and then recounted in order to adjust the field es- timates. All ant groups were underestimated in the field, most no- tably the larger colonies. Hence, the field estimates were corrected according to a linear regression with the laboratory counts (log lab count=1.82xlog field count-0.85; r=0.99; Fig. 2). When compar- ing availability and selection of prey we used biomass (dry weight) as a basis. We chose biomass, rather than abundance, since this better represents the importance of each species in satis- fying the nutritional demands of the birds.

The availability of forag- ing F rufa species could not be properly estimated, and we therefore may have underestimated the total available biomass in summer of this ant group. To assess the availability of ants at feeding sites in summer, we weighted the ant biomass estimates from the transects by the number of feeding sites in different habitat types. We then pooled the data and tested the observed versus expected proportions of ant groups using number of droppings as the sample size. Inactive F rufa species in ant mounds were the only prey in winter. To assess their relative availability, we surveyed 45 ho- mogenous forest stands, 10-120 years old, varying in size from 1 to 5 ha. We estimated the volume (1) of the mound according to the diameter and height of a paraboloid hemisphere (Gosswald 1989), and expressed the availability as the total volume of ant mounds per hectare. To evaluate whether winter food was in short supply, we counted the number of ant mounds that had not been used by green woodpeckers within a circle of 1 ha (radius=56.4 m) centred around each used ant mound (n=10). We considered this to be a relevant estimate of food availability. Statistics Preference and avoidance were defined as, respectively, a signifi- cantly greater or smaller (P&lt;0.05) use of habitats than what could be expected on the basis of availability, using the Bonferroni Z-test in multiple comparisons (Neu et al. 1974; Marcum and Loftsgaarden 1980; Manly et al. 1993). Unless otherwise stated, standard two-tailed parametric and non-parametric tests were used (Sokal and Rohlf 1981). Prey selection was tested with a good- ness-of-fit test (G-test), based on the biomass of the different ant groups and using the number of droppings as sample size. Ideally, this approach requires that each dropping is treated as if it con- tained only one ant group. In fact, 73% of the excrements con- tained a mixture of different groups, but the majority (91%) were dominated (&gt;50%) by one group. Results Selection of home ranges Summer home ranges varied from 28 to 183 ha (mean±SE; 98±28 ha, n=6) and winter home ranges from 48 to 154 ha (102+25 ha, n=4) (Table 3). There were no regular seasonal movements or shifts in home ranges within the study area, and male and female ranges over- lapped extensively within pairs. All the green woodpecker localities (n=8) were confined to areas (circles with r=l km) with scattered houses surrounded with lawns, mead- ows and pastures (Fig. IC), whereas the probability of randomly drawing out a similar sized area containing cul- tivated land was only 44% (P=0.002, one-tailed). Accord- ingly, birds were captured in roosting and nest holes closer to cultivated land (median=45 m, n=12) than what was ex- pected from a random use of available roosting holes within the study area (median=805 m, n=200; Mann- Whitney U-test, U=341, Z=3.54, P&lt;0.001, one-tailed).

Tree species composition is grouped in 10% categories pected from a random use of cultivated land within the home ranges (eight plots on cultivated land; Fisher's ex- act test, P&lt;0.001). Among the forest habitat types, birds preferred young forest (16-30 years old) and avoided clearcuts and stands &gt;30 years old in summer (Fig. 3B). In winter, 51- to 80-year-old stands were preferred (Fig. 3C). Old forest stands, 81-120 years old, were used more often than expected in winter, but not significantly so, probably due to small sample size. Cultivated land and clearcuts were not used at all, and young forest stands were avoided in winter. In summer, spruce-domi- nated stands were preferred (G=39.6, df=3, P&lt;0.001; cat- egories: 0, 10-30, 40-70, and 80-100%), pine-dominat- ... h ri I I I .

In winter, forest stands were used according to the avail- ability of the different tree species (P&gt;0.20, for all com- parisons). Diet and prey selection Winter diet consisted almost entirely of the F rufa group (Fig. 5), which seemed to be in abundant supply. We found three to eight unused ant mounds within a circle of 1 ha around each used ant mound (n=10), and the birds spent only about 10% of the day foraging. During sum- mer, the birds preyed upon a variety of ants, but the Serviformica group comprised the most important part of the diet of both adults and nestlings (Fig. 5, Table 5). The F rufa group was found in the summer diet, but in considerably smaller amounts than in the winter. The diet of the nestlings was similar to that of the adults (Table 5). Compared to the availability of the different ant groups at feeding sites, the Serviformica group was clearly preferred as prey in summer (Fig. 6). This was also evident from the composition of the adult droppings (Fig. 7). Almost all droppings (90%) contained remains of Serviformica, and as much as 23% contained only Serviformica. This contrasts sharply with the other ant groups, all occurring in less than 58% (L. niger) of the droppings, and with one or a few droppings composed of only that ant group. Lasius niger was the second most important prey group, used in the same proportion as ex- pected from availability, whereas L. flavus and Myrmica- o Ct 0 O ON C) a0 '0 co rj~ C) ..

However, available colonies of these two groups occurred at very low densities, rendering the dif- ference between use and availability statistically non- significant (Fig. 6). The availability of the latter two groups was also less precisely estimated than the other groups. We checked whether the size of the ants explained the preference pattern. Except for the Mynnica-Leptothorax group, there was a positive relationship between ant body mass and a preference index, calculated as the ratio of the proportional biomass of ant groups in the adult droppings and the proportional biomass of the same groups in the transects (preference index=5.0xlog bio- mass+0.8, r=0.998; Myrmica-Leptothorax group exclud- ed; Fig. 8).

Categories of ant groups are given in Table 2 was highest in young spruce forest (16-30 years) and lowest in clearcuts and older stands (&gt;30 years). This corresponds well with the habitat selection of the birds, as they preferred cultivated land and young spruce for- est. The biomass of the most common prey in the sum- mer diet, the Serviformica group, was similar in forest (1.15 kg/ha) and on cultivated land (1.16 kg/ha). The L. niger and L. flavus groups dominated on cultivated land with 2.44 and 3.19 kg/ha, respectively, and the latter was found exclusively on cultivated land. Although L. niger and L. flavus were not preferred food items, the proportion of these prey groups in the diet was positively 0-15 16-30 31-50 51-80 &gt; 80 FOREST STAND AGE CLASS Fig. 9 Availability of the mound-building Formica rufa group in relation to forest stand age classes at Varaldskogen, south-central Scandinavia, 1991-1995. The availability is presented as the total volume (1) of mounds per hectare. Sample sizes and 95% confi- dence intervals are indicated related both to the amount of cultivated land within the birds' localities, and the proportion of the birds' radio- locations within cultivated land (Spearman rank tests, one-tailed, rs=0.55, P=0.05, n=10, and rs=0.73, P=0.05, n=6, respectively). In winter, the volume of F rufa ant mounds was highest within the age-classes 51-80 and &gt;80 years, lower in clearcuts and young forest stands, and mounds were absent in cultivated land (Fig. 9), cor- responding to the shift in the birds' habitat use to closed- canopy spruce forests. Discussion Green woodpecker home ranges were exclusively con- fined to those parts of the landscape that contained meadows, pastures, lawns and houses, confirming the prediction of the general affinity to cultivated land (e.g. Haftorn 1971; Blume 1981). At a smaller scale, we found a preference for cultivated land as feeding sites within home ranges, conforming to our finding at the Table 6 Biomass (kg dry weight/ha) of ant groups in different habitats used as feeding sites by green woodpeckers at Varaldskogen, south-central Scandinavia, 1991-1995.

However, birds extensively utilized for- est habitats as feeding sites both in summer (young plan- tations) and particularly during winter months (old for- est). At the smallest scale, i.e. selection of prey items within feeding sites, we found no indication that ant groups specifically confined to cultivated land were im- portant elements in the diet. In fact, L. flavus, which oc- curred exclusively in pastures and meadows, was clearly avoided, and L. niger, which was also most abundant on cultivated land, was used in the same proportion as ex- pected from a random choice of prey items. Serviformi- ca, the dominant and preferred ant group in the diet, was equally abundant on cultivated land and in forest habi- tats. Thus, the importance of cultivated land as determi- nant of the selection pattern seemed to diminish towards the smaller spatial scales. The woodpeckers' preference for cultivated land as feeding habitat, which was used four to five times more frequently than expected, may be explained by the fact that this habitat supported a higher overall biomass of ants than clearcuts and forested habitat. Cultivated land contained threefold more biomass than forest habitat in general and 1.6-fold more biomass than the most ant-rich successional stage, 16- to 30-year-old spruce stands. The variety of ant groups preyed upon in summer, and the relatively large variation among individual summer di- ets, support the conclusion that the overall abundance of ants was more important in determining habitat selection than the actual composition of ant groups. The prefer- ence pattern for forest age classes was also in accordance with food abundance. In summer, 16- to 30-year-old stands were preferred, these offering the highest biomass of ants. In winter, 51- to 80-year-old stands were pre- ferred, the age class with the highest volume of F rufa ant mounds (see also Rosengren et al. 1979; Savolainen and Vepsalainen 1988). Thus, the seasonal shift in use of forest age classes, from young forest in summer to older forest in winter, corresponded with a dietary shift from ground-dwelling ants to ant mounds of the F rufa group. The groups of prey found in excrements were in ac- cordance with findings in other parts of Europe (re- viewed in Cramp 1985), but the proportions were differ- ent. Of note, the L. flavus group, which was exclusively and abundantly found on cultivated land, was not impor- tant in the diet. Overall, the green woodpeckers seemed rather flexible in choosing among ant species. Our hy- pothesis, that the occurrence of particular food items could explain the affinity to cultivated land, is thus not supported. In summer, several ant species were eaten, but in win- ter, the green woodpecker was capable of subsisting al- most exclusively on the F rufa group. There are reports that nestlings can be fed entirely on F. rufa (Knystautas and Liutkus 1981). The black woodpecker also has a diet dominated by ants, and shows the same versatility in terms of prey selection. It has a summer diet similar to that of the green woodpecker, but eats primarily Cam- ponotus in winter (Pynnbnen 1943; Cramp 1985; Miku- sinski 1997; own unpublished data). We found a positive relationship between ant body mass and a prey prefer- ence index. This suggests that the size of the ants was an overriding factor determining prey preference. A notable exception was the Myrmica-Leptothorax group, which comprises ant species larger than both L. flavus and L. niger, but which was rarely preyed upon. The thick, indigestible integument possessed by the myrmicine ant species (Wheeler 1910) may be a plausible explanation. Availability of winter food is put forward as an im- portant factor limiting the breeding densities of many birds (Fretwell 1972), and resident insectivores in north- ern regions may be particularly vulnerable (Pettersson 1985; Nilsson et al. 1992; Rolstad and Rolstad 1995; Saari and Mikusinski 1996). Less snow and milder win- ters may explain the varied winter diet of green wood- peckers in temperate deciduous forests, including L. niger, L. fuliginosus, L. flavus and Myrmica spp. (Skott 1971; De Bruyn et al. 1972; Speight 1973; Lohrl 1977). Harsh winter climate is reported to cause fluctuations and falls in green woodpecker populations (Wendland 1964; De Bruyn et al. 1972; Glutz von Blotzheim and Bauer 1980). For the studied green woodpecker population, however, winter food seemed to be abundant. We ob- served that when the birds had chosen an ant mound, they visited the same site repeatedly over several weeks. Some days it was hard to obtain feeding observations on certain birds, because they foraged infrequently. The small amount of time they spent feeding in winter indi- cates that the food supply was adequate. Mound-building ants in the F rufa group feature long-lived and stable colonies in boreal forests, which are presumably little influenced by winter weather con- ditions (Rosengren et al. 1979; Savolainen and Vepsala- inen 1988). The largest colonies are usually situated at the base of tree trunks in older forest stands where branches reduce the impact of heavy snow. Thus, in con- tinental parts of Scandinavia, where snow depth rarely exceeds 50-100 cm, these colonies are presumably fairly accessible for the green woodpecker. On the other hand, severe winters may be detrimental to the green wood- pecker through direct physiological effects. Unfortunate- ly, because heavy winter snows did not occur during the study period, possible consequences of winter weather conditions remain speculative. We found no evidence that deciduous forest was an important habitat component for the green woodpecker. Deciduous-dominated stands were used in the same pro- portion as expected from a random use of forest stands. This supports Petersen's (1945) finding that the green woodpecker is able to breed in conifer forests. Why then does it seem to fail to colonize conifer forest tracts, de- spite their apparently sufficient supply of both summer and winter food? The pine marten was the principal predator on black woodpecker nests in a companion study in the same area (Rolstad et al. 2000), and this medium-sized predator avoids open areas such as clearcuts, pastures and agricul- tural fields (Marchesi 1989; Brainerd 1990, 1997). Nest predation was almost twice as high on black woodpecker</page><page sequence="12">nests in older forest stands (45%) compared to nests in trees retained on recent clearcuts (26%) (Rolstad et al. 2000). The entrance hole of green woodpecker nests is considerably smaller (64x64 mm) than that for the black woodpecker (92x126 mm). However, female pine mar- tens weigh only two-thirds that of males (832 vs 1,216 g; Helldin 1999). Hence, green woodpecker nest holes are presumably accessible for female pine martens, a hy- pothesis supported by the observation that one of the studied nests, located in old spruce forest, was predated by marten. Red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), another po- tential nest predator, also has a preference for older coni- fer stands (Andren and Lemnell 1992; Andren and Delin 1994). Nonetheless, recent clearcuts (&lt;5 years old), with suitable nest sites in retained aspen trees, comprised 6% of the study area (Rolstad et al. 1998). Therefore, green woodpeckers apparently had ample opportunities to se- lect nest sites off cultivated land with a relaxed predation pressure. With reservations due to small sample size, we argue that neither food nor predation provides adequate expla- nations for the consistent affinity of green woodpeckers to cultivated land in the present study. Looking at habitat selection as a hierarchical process, from choice of home range to choice of dietary item (Hilden 1965; Johnson 1980; Morris 1987; Kotliar and Wiens 1990), we pro- pose the following mechanism for habitat selection in the green woodpecker. The geographic distribution of the green woodpecker barely extends into the boreal forest. Possibly, this woodpecker originally evolved in rather dense, temperate broad-leaved forests, where little light percolates to the ground (Short 1982). The dense decidu- ous forest probably supports little available biomass of ants, and birds seek out open grasslands and meadows, where suitable habitat for soil-dwelling ants is found. These broad-leaved forests presumably also provide little open habitat off cultivated land serving as refuges for nest predators like pine marten, stone marten (M. foina) and red squirrel. Our study area is situated in a conifer-dominated landscape on the northern edge of the green woodpeck- er's geographic range. Boreal forests are more open than temperate deciduous forests, and soil-dwelling ants are available in a broader range of habitats. However, based on their internal image of what constitutes suitable habi- tat, young dispersing woodpeckers still may use open grasslands and meadows as a key stimulus encouraging settlement, giving rise to a preponderance of home rang- es in landscapes with a certain amount of cultivated land. Recruiting birds may fail to colonize continuous conifer forests, even though they provide ample food and suit- able nest sites, because these landscapes do not provide the right cues (Svardson 1949; Hilden 1965; James 1971; Cody 1981; Wiens 1989; Orians and Wittenberger 1991). Once settled in a home range, the birds seem to select feeding sites according to the total availability of ants in different habitats. In managed conifer forests, young suc- cessional stages come close to cultivated land in terms of available ant biomass, giving rise to extensive use of 127 young conifer stands as feeding habitat within the home ranges. To what degree may clearcuts and young plantations substitute for cultivated land as feeding habitat (Sharrock 1976)? Our results indicate that stand replacement cut- tings actually improve the amount of summer food avail- able to the green woodpecker, compared to selective cut- ting methods. On the other hand, the winter food source may be reduced. After clearcutting, shade-tolerant mounds of the F rufa group are abandoned, and the col- onies are not re-established until forest succession pro- ceeds (Rosengren and Pamilo 1978). The changes in light conditions and temperature following clearcutting favour soil-dwelling ants, and these are the first to colo- nize the clearings (Punttila et al. 1991). However, it does seem to be a rather short period during succession, i.e. 16-30 years of age, that forest stands support densities of soil-dwelling ants, which are comparable to cultivated land (Rolstad et al. 1998). Clearcuts provided very low ant densities, and were clearly avoided by the woodpeck- ers. Although forest habitats rarely approach cultivated land regarding overall ant biomass, they probably pro- vide sufficient food sources to support green woodpeck- ers during summer. More importantly, snow and frozen ground presumably prevent green woodpeckers from feeding on soil-dwelling ants in winter, which is the case for the closely related grey-headed woodpecker (Rolstad and Rolstad 1995). Thus, older forest stands with E rufa mounds may be a prerequisite for green woodpecker sur- vival during winter in the northern part of its distribution range. The green woodpecker is reported to have declined in number in Sweden, presumably due to changes in agri- cultural practices (Nilsson et al. 1992). Many former pastures are now to a large extent overgrown with tree plantations. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that the degree to which this affects the green woodpecker depends on the spatial scale at which cultivated land is replaced with young forest stands. Our results indicate that at the scale of home ranges, the woodpeckers suc- cessfully utilize young plantations and old forest stands as feeding habitat if cultivated land occurs in the neigh- bourhood. At a larger scale, however, green woodpecker populations may fail to establish in continuous forest tracts because the landscapes lack cultivated land serving as a key stimulus encouraging individuals to settle. This hypothesis could be tested by monitoring radio-marked dispersing juveniles in forest landscapes with different mosaics of cultivated land. It is tempting to suggest that the issue also has a tem- poral scale dimension related to the flexibility of green woodpeckers to adjust their behaviour to changes in land use by means of forestry and agriculture in Scandinavia. The shift in land use practice, from selective to clearcut forest harvesting and the abandonment and reforestation of previous pastures, has taken place during a fairly short time period, i.e. 40-50 years. Our study indicates that present-day forest landscapes may offer suitable habitats</page><page sequence="13">128 for the green woodpecker, provided that deciduous trees serving as nest sites are retained on clearcuts and that young plantations are not too densely stocked. Although the green woodpecker seems to have de- clined in numbers, it is not considered a vulnerable or endangered species. However, a whole suite of other species - including the red-listed wryneck (Jynx tor- quilla), many higher plants, fungi, and insect species - is associated with meadows, pastures and old cultivated fields (Bengtsson-Lindsjo et al. 1991; Ihse 1994; Hojer 1995; Ihse and Norderhaug 1995; Direktoratet for Natur- forvaltning 1999). New approaches for conserving biodi- versity in old cultural landscapes are therefore likely to benefit the green woodpecker as well.
