<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cow Boy Revisited PAUL HORGAN ever since the eighteenth century the raising and tending of large herds of beef cattle had been practiced on the Rio Grande's wide flat borderlands. All de- scended from animals brought to Mexico in the sixteenth century by Spaniards, there were several types of cattle on the river plains, of which the most distinctive had tremendously long horns doubled up and backward for half their length; heavy thin heads; tall legs, and narrow, power- ful flanks. They were haired in various colors, with white patches. By the hun- dred thousand, wild cattle roved at large over the uninhabited land on both sides of the border, and constituted its prevail- ing form of wealth. As such they were always prizes for Indians, Mexicans, and Americans who in an unbroken tradition of border violence raided the herds - preferably those already gathered into ownership by other men - and drove away thousands of animals to sell on the hoof, or to kill for their hides which were bailed and sold to traders, while the car- casses were left to carrion, and the bones to workers who gathered them up and hauled them for sale as fertilizer to Texas farming towns. Even in the face of such hazard a few cattle traders drove herds east to New Copyright 1954, by Paul Horgan Orleans, north to Missouri, and west even as far as California, before the Civil War. But the trade was unorganized, and the principal markets, New Orleans and Mo- bile, were supplied by cattle steamers that sailed out of the Texas Gulf ports. The longhorn cattle they carried were called "coasters" or "sea lions." The coast- wise cattle trade was limited by a mo- nopoly held on Gulf shipping by the Mor- gan Line. "To anyone outside of the ship company," wrote an early cattle trader, "an enormous rate of freight was exacted, practically debarring the ordinary ship- per." And when the Civil War took levies of man power from the cattle business, the trade was further constricted. In con- sequence of such conditions, "for a quar- ter of a century or more," the trader re- marked, "the herds of Texas continued to increase much faster than the mature surplus was marketed. In fact, no market accessible existed sufficiently to consume this surplus, and of course the stock [be- came] less valuable in proportion as it be- came plentiful." But shortly after the Civil War the cattle trade was revived, and by the seventies, the herds of Texas owners were the largest in the United States. Of these, some of the largest be- longed to great companies operating where the nation's range cattle industry had its southwest Review 285</page><page sequence="2">origin - along the Rio Grande between the Pecos and Mexico Bay. It was the brasada , the brush country, stretching from the Nueces to the Rio Grande. It was profuse in growths - but almost all were thorned. It was either swept with gray dust borne on blistering winds or beaten by deluges that hissed as they first struck the hot ground or raked by blizzards that came whistling out of the north. In its interlocking thickets that enclosed small clearings where grew curly mesquite grass, cattle could graze by thousands and hardly be seen by horse- men who sought them. There cicadas sang of the heat, and sharp-haired peccaries rooted among the thorns, and blue quail ran amidst the wiry shadows, and rattle- snakes sought the cool and sometimes were drummed to death by wild turkey gobblers at whose destroying wings they struck and struck with no effect on nerve- less quill and feather. It was a land of hard secrets, the best kept of which was the location of water. Its few rivers ran in abruptly cut trenches walled with pink or yellow or slate blue limestone, and could not be seen except from their very brinks. In every direction the wilderness looked the same. There were no distant moun- tains to be seen. The land swelled away to- ward the white sky in slow rolls and shim- mered in the heat that blended the ashen color of the ground with the olive greens of the brush until across the distance there seemed to hang a veil of dusty lilac. It was astonishing how much human activity there was in a land so hostile to man's needs. It was the scene of habitual Indian travels, and of the military cam- paigns of the Mexicans and Texans in their wars, and of the United States Army in its Rio Grande movements, and of traveling traders, missioners, and crim- inals. In its thickets there was even an occasional small ranch, locked in isolation by sun, distance, and the poverty of its occupants, who possessed even few wishes. And it became the scene of organized work in the cattle business. Animals born and grown there were taken in herds to the milder prairies above the Nueces, and across the rest of Texas and Oklahoma to beef markets in the north. "... The cow boys, as the common laborers are termed," said a cattleman who saw the industry develop, "go in squads of four or five scouting over the entire range, camping wherever night overtakes them, catching with the lasso upon the prairies every young animal found whose mother bears their employer's brand." It was "legal and a universal practice to capture any unmarked and unbranded animal upon the range and mark and brand the same in their employer's brand, no mat- ter to whom the animal may really be- long, so be it is over one year old and unbranded. ..." The cow boy was the last of the clearly original types of Western American to draw his general tradition and character from the kind of land he worked in, and the kind of work he did. His forerunners were the trapper of the mountains and the trader of the plains. Of the three, he left the fullest legacy of romance; and to see him as he first was, it would be neces- sary in a later century to clear a way back to him through a dense folk litera- ture of the printed page, the moving pic- ture film, and the radio that in using all 286 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="3">his symbols would almost never touch the reality that supported them. His work was monotonous in hardship and loneliness, and occasionally it was shot through with excitement that rose from danger. The country where he worked was in its dimensions and charac- ter his enemy; and yet it was also in an in- timate way almost a completion of his na- ture, that reveled in vast vacant priv- acies, and fixed its vision on the distance as though to avoid any social responsibil- ity. He had for his most constant com- panion not a man or a woman, but an animal - his horse, on whom his work and his convenience and even at times his life depended. His duties took him endlessly riding over range country, where he sought for cattle to capture, calves or yearlings to brand, herds to drive to water, individual cows or bulls of a proper age or condition to cut out of a herd for seg- regation into another group. Such a group would then be driven to another location - a different pasture or a market. In dealing with cows through the con- sent of his horse, the cow boy needed to know much of the nature of both animals. Through experience he learned to antic- ipate the behavior of cattle, and to judge the effect upon them of every stimulus. He saw that the laws that governed them were the laws of the crowd; and he de- veloped extraordinary skill in handling great crowds of cattle at a time. His horse, broken to riding, and subject to his will, he had to know as an individual creature, and dominate relentlessly its nature by turns sensitive, stubborn, and gentle. Liv- ing with these two animal natures, the cow boy seemed to acquire in his own cer- tain of their traits, almost as though to be effective at living and working with them, he must open his own animal nature to theirs and through sympathy resemble them. If he could be as simple as a cow, he could also be as stubborn; as fearless as a wild mustang, and as suspicious of the unfamiliar; as incurious as an individual bull, and as wild to run with a crowd when attracted. Even in his physical type, the cow boy might tend to resemble his animal companions - a certain flare of nostril and whiteness of eyelash could re- call the thoughtless face of a calf; a lean- ness of leg and arm was a reminder of a horse's fine-boned supports and further suggested the physique best adapted to, and developed for, the horseman's job - the hard, sinewy body, light of weight but powerful, tall for high vision over the animal herd, long-legged for gripping the mount around its breathing barrel. His state of body and nerve had to be ready to fight, for his job sometimes included bat- tle, when Indians or organized cattle and horse thieves came down upon his herd. Then like any soldier he had to shoot to kill, under the sanction of his duty. For his labors, he was paid in the 1870's from fifteen to twenty dollars a month in gold or silver. He saw himself at his task, and his self-image survived in his anonymous folk literature: All day long on the prairie I ride, Not even a dog to trot by my side: My fire I kindle with chips gathered round, My coffee I boil without being ground. In any group of nineteenth-century cow boys, more were bearded than clean- shaven. Their costumes were much alike, southwest Review 287</page><page sequence="4">though with individual variations. But all their garments were "coarse and substan- tial, few in number and often of the gaudy pattern." The cow boy wore a wide-brim- med hat with its crown dented into a pyra- mid or flattened. If the brim in front was sometimes turned up off his face, it could be turned down to protect him from the pressing light of the sky under which he spent all day. Around his neck he wore a bandana of tough silk. It served many purposes. Tied over his face it filtered dust before his breath. It served to blind- fold a calf or tie its legs. It was a towel, a napkin, a bandage, a handkerchief, or simply an ornament. His shirt was of stout cotton flannel, in a bright color or loud design of checks or stripes or plaids. Over it he sometimes wore a cloth or leather vest but rarely a jacket. His trou- sers were either of heavy denim, dyed dark blue, sewn with coarse yellow thread, and reinforced at points of great wear with copper rivets; or were of odd colors and materials, mostly dark, that could stand tough use. They fitted tightly. The trouser legs were stuffed into boots that reached almost to the knee. At work, the cow boy often wore leggings - two long tubes, with wide flaps at each side cut into fringes or studded with silver disks, that reached from ankle to groin, and were tied to a belt as though to the string of a breechclout. Their purpose was to shield him against thorns in the brush he rode through, and the violent rub of haired animal hides, and the burn of rope when he pulled it against his leg as he turned his horse to control a lassoed crea- ture. On his boots he wore large spurs, of silver or iron. He wore gloves to work in, and around his tight hips he wore a cart- ridge belt from which depended his pistol - most often a Colt's single-action, 45 caliber revolver called the Peacemaker. He had no change of clothing. He went unwashed and unbathed unless he camped by a stream or a pond. He said in his mul- tiple anonymity, I wash in a pool and wipe on a sack; I carry my wardrobe all on my back. . . . Like the object of his work and its chief instrument - the cow and the horse - his Texas saddle, in its essential form, came from Spain. Its high pommel and cantle, heavy stirrups, and great weight sug- gested the squarish, chairlike saddle of the jousting knight, though its design was modified by Mexican saddlers until all contours were rounded and smoothed, and the pommel, of silver or other metal, was developed to serve as a cleat about which to secure the lariat whose other end was noosed about a captive cow or horse. When not in use the lariat was coiled and tied to the saddle. There was little other baggage on the saddle, except now and then a leather scabbard containing a short rifle. If two cow boys traveled together they carried their camp equipment and bedrolls on a pack animal. Otherwise, when a large group worked daily out of a central camp, their equipment was car- ried in the camp wagon to which they re- turned during the day for meals and at night for fire, food, and companionship. The wagon, pulled by four horses and driven by the camp cook, was a roving headquarters for the grazing party. Its form was invented in the 1850's by Charles Goodnight, who adapted an army 288 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="5">vehicle to the needs of the cow camp. Rolling in movement, it had a compact look, with its sheets over bows that con- cealed the contents, v^hich consisted of bedrolls for the workers, and at its free end a high, square chest standing upright. Parked, free of its horses, and with its sheets extended and supported by poles to make a generous pavilion of shade to one side, the wagon seemed to expand into several times its own size. It was amazing how much it carried, and how much immediate ground its unpacked equipment could cover. The chest at the rear was faced with a wooden lid which when opened downward became a work- table supported by a central leg. Then were revealed in the chest many fitted drawers and hatches in which the cook kept every necessity for cooking and every oddment, including medicines. Behind it in the wagon bed, along with the bedrolls, he carried his heavy pots and skillets and tin dishes. Beneath the wagon frame hung buckets and to its sides were lashed water barrels. The cooking fire, which at night served also to give its only light to the camp gathering, was made a few feet from the wagon and its profuse scatter of equip- ment. There the cook prepared his meals, always the same. If brush or wood were scarce, he made his fire of dried animal droppings, like the Spanish soldiers who centuries before had found these the only useful product of fabled Quivira. If he had no matches he could start his fire by pouring gunpowder into his pistol, wad- ding it loosely, and firing it with its muz- zle close to a scrap of cloth or other dry kindling. He prepared a great pot of cof- fee boiled from whole beans. A cow boy drank a quart or more every day. Of such coffee it was said that "y°u would hesi- tate, if judging from appearance, whether to call it coffee or ink." It was drunk with- out cream or sugar. There was a kettle full of stew in which using his pocket- knife - his only table service - the cow boy probed for a lump of meat. With thick biscuit or cornbread he soaked up the gravy and like an Indian ate from his fingers. There were no green vegetables to be had. A pot of kidney beans finished the meal. The cow boys squatted near one another, or stood idling by the wagon, and ate in silence and with speed. A meal was not an occasion of social interest. It was an act of need, disposed of without grace or amenity. Inseparable from it were the taste and smell of dust and cow- hair and horse sweat and leather - sensory attributes of everything in the cow boy's working life. For want of an oven I cook bread in a pot, And sleep on the ground for want of a cot. But before the bedrolls were opened up from their heavy canvas covers, and the work party went to sleep, there was a little while for talk and other diversion. Such a miniature society created its own theater. There was always someone who would be moved to perform, while the rest gazed at the intimate, never-failing marvel of how one whom they knew - a man just like them - became before their very eyes somebody else. The campfire put rosy light over the near faces of the gathered men and their cluttered posses- sions, and threw their shadows like spokes out on the flat ground until the immense southwest Review 289</page><page sequence="6">darkness absorbed all. At the very center of light a fellow rose. He had a joke to tell. He acted it out. It may have been well known to all, but they listened in fixity. It was likely to be an obscene jape. The cow boy, observed a cattleman of the seventies, "relishes ... a corrupt tale, wherein abounds much vulgarity and ani- mal propensity." His delight was a prac- tical joke on one of his fellows. The jokç was good if it made a fool of someone. It was better if it mocked the victim's pe- culiarity, and it was even better if it played upon "animal propensity" - for the sake of symbolic relief of the enforced continence under which the work party lived on the range. There were other stories to hear - many dealt with experiences in the Civil War, to which the early cow boys were still close in time. There were wrestling and other trials of strength to perform. There were songs to sing, some of whose texts were lewd parodies of sentimental bal- lads. All knew the songs of the cattle trail, and could sing them together. If in one of his cubbyholes the cook carried a violin for its owner, there would be fiddle music of an astonishing legerity that yet man- aged to seem tuneless, while a cow boy danced a clog in firelighted dust, and the rest clapped hands. Often a mournful piety stirred in someone, and when he be- gan to sing a hymn, others joined him, and like a sigh of innocence, their united voices rose over their lonely fire where they camped, a little knot of men with every potentiality, to one or another de- gree, for every human attribute. The bed- rolls came out of the wagon and were spread. Nobody had a book to read, and in any case, the firelight was dying and would soon be down to coals. My ceiling's the sky, my floor is the grass; My music's the lowing of herds as they pass; My books are the brooks, my sermons the stones, My parson a wolf on his pulpit of bones. . . . As his artless song implied, the cow boy belonged to the type of man who was not, actually, domesticated. He chose freedom in the wilds over responsibilities of hearth and home. He thought more about work than he did of a family. He made love on almost a seasonal schedule, as though in rut. He visited a prostitute, or took a sweetheart, only to leave her, with sighs about how he must go roaming, as though all would understand his natural state. He departed for work or went off to fight wherever he would find other men like himself. He preferred the society of men to that of women: for only with men could he live a daily life that was made up of danger, and hard exposure, and prim- itive manners. These did not seem like disadvantages to him, for he liked them for themselves; and, further, they brought into his life excitement, freedom, and wilderness, all of which he sought. If he saw himself as a simple creature, and if tradition so accepted him, both were wrong. His temperament and char- acter were full of tempestuous contradic- tions and stresses. The life he chose re- sembled the Indian's more than any other, but it - lacked the sustaining spiritual power of the Indian's nature-mythology, and so it could not really hold for him the unquestioned dignity of a system that tried to explain - in whatever error - 290 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="7">the whole of human life. He was close to the frontiersman, many of whose ways he repeated, but he was neither innovator, builder, nor explorer. His love of hardness and primitive conditions could be turned either to serve his comrades in unbreak- able loyalty, or to lead him, as it did in individual cases, to a career as gunman or cattle thief. His longing for love was so great that he felt an exaggerated chivalry for womankind, but in his worship he made women unreal; and yet through his song literature he lamented, ". . . between me and love lies a gulf very wide." He sanctioned his state by romanticizing it in ballad and story; but he refuted it sym- bolically by his periodic violent outbreaks of gunplay, drunkenness, and venery. And with all his hardness, he gave in to a soft core of sentiment whose objects were the animals he worked with, and the com- rades who worked with him. "I and they were but creatures of cir- cumstance," said a cow boy of his fellows in his domesticated old age, " - the cir- cumstances of an unfenced world." From their unfencedness came their main char- acteristics. Solitude was put upon them by their chosen environment, which thus modified their character. "Adhesiveness," in the jargon of the nineteenth-century parlor science, was a human trait. The nearest living being to whom the cow boy could turn with affection was his horse. It was his daylong companion and helper. It obeyed his orders and made him master of distance and took him in and out of danger. Responding to his signals, it seemed to him to possess more than animal intelligence. His horse, a masterpiece of anthropomorphism, joined him in a part- nership, and was paid every honor due to such a position. Continued the retired cow boy, My horse was something alive, something in- telligent and friendly and true. He was sensi- tive, and for him I had a profound feeling. I sometimes think back on . . . remarkable horses I owned in much the same way that I think back on certain friends that have left me. ... I went hungry sometimes, but if there was any possible way of getting food for my horse or if there was a place to stake him, even though I had to walk back a mile after putting him to graze [and cow boys hated to walk] I never let him go hungry. Many a time I have divided the water in a canteen with a horse. If it was expedient to take care of his horse in order to assure his own mobility and safety, and if it was ordinary human kindness to care for a dumb creature, there was yet more than such promptings in the cow boy's devotion to his mount, as many a song and story attested. The professional cow boy rarely had a culti- vated mind; and in his incurious thought he was lowered and his horse was elevated until they drew together in common iden- tity. It was a process typical of a juvenile stage of character, and it may have sug- gested why the cow boy and his legend should appeal forever after as a figure of play to little boys. In much the same sort of emotion the cow boy felt a mournful fondness for the animals he herded - the little "dogies" to whom he sang on the trail to keep them quiet, and to whom he attributed something of himself as they were objects of his vigilance and labor, day and night. In its innocence and pathos his system of projected sentimentality for his animals suggested that only by making southwest Review 291</page><page sequence="8">of them more than they were could he have survived his lonely and arduous duty with them. One of his songs said of the cow boy that "his education is but to en- dure. ..." Another song celebrated the life of cow boys together in their wandering yet co- herent community. "The boys were like brothers," they sang of themselves, "their friendship was great. ..." Alike in their extreme individualism, their self-reliance, their choice of a life wild, free, and rude, the companions of the cow camp gave to one another an extreme loyalty. It seemed like a tribute to the hard skills they had to master to do their jobs. A man who proved himself able at it deserved mem- bership in a freemasonry unlike any other. Its physical tasks caused a high value to come upon the life of action, in which there was no place for the values of mind and spirit. These were relegated to the world of women; and in the towns and cities that later completed the settling of the last frontier West, for the better part of a century it would be the women's or- ganizations that would try to rescue the fine arts, education, religion, and social amenity from being held as simply irrele- vant to civilized life - an attitude even more withering to mankind's highest ex- pressions than one of mere contempt. For its purpose in its time, the brotherhood of the cow camp was all that was needed to make an effective society. Diverse like all individuals, and sprung from various backgrounds and kinds of experience, the cow boys taken together seemed to merge into a type more readily than most work- ers in a common job. Their environment directly created the terms of their work, and their work in its uncomplicated terms created their attitudes and points of view. And if they were like one another in their principal traits, it was because so many of them chose their calling for the same general reason. This - it was attested to again and again in the cow boy's anonymous ballad literature - this was flight from one kind of life to another. Many cow boys left home, said a ballad, Each with a hidden secret well smothered in his breast, Which brought us out to Mexico, way out here in the West. In this lay a suggestion of doom, a rude Byronism that was echoed in other songs by allusions to unhappiness, guilt, escape. Some were driven to the new society of the cow range by a faithless girl at home, or a dissolute life, or a criminal past; others by inability to become reconciled to their home societies following the Civil War, or by bitterness in family life, or even by a cruel stepmother. Romantic conven- tions of behavior in the nineteenth cen- tury could move the cow boy, who pun- ished those who had betrayed him. "I'll go," he threatened, ... to the Rio Grande, And get me a job with a cow boy band. He did not mean a band of musicians, for not until the next century would the cow boy's public identity be chiefly that of an entertainer who in a commercial adaptation of the cow boy costume would spend more time with a microphone than with either horse or cow. No, with com- 292 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="9">panions on the cattle range, the cow boy, deaf to dissuasion by loved ones who had proved faithless, promised to go . . . where the bullets fly, And follow the cow trail till I die. Unable for whatever reason to accept the bindings of conventional society, within the one he sought and helped to make on the last frontier he was capable of sure dependability in any cause for the common good of his comrades, whom he did not judge, even if sometimes a propen- sity to go wrong should overtake them in the very land where they had thought to escape their doom. Who knew when a man might encounter the moral frailty of one of his friends of the brushlands? As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, As I walked out in Laredo one day, I spied a dear cow boy wrapped up in white linen, Wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay. It was a dirge for a young man who in his dying words revealed a longing for a gentler land than the dusty empire of his work, and confessed his errors. "Oh, beat the drums slowly," he said, . . . and play the fife lowly, Play the Dead March as you carry me along; Take me to the green valley, there lay the sod o'er me, For I'm a young cow boy and I know I've done wrong. Unashamed of their grief that sprang from their close living, his bearers saw themselves in him, and if he had sinned, they could not condemn him. We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly, And bitterly wept as we bore him along; For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome, We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong. For here was a clan feeling, a solidarity, with a realistic view of character and its capacity for error. Idealizing one another in the all-male society of their work and play, the cow boys remained loyal above, or even because of, the weaknesses they shared and assuaged with violence. In con- clusion, the dirge moved from the indi- vidual to the group. Then beat your drum lowly and play your fife slowly, Beat the Dead March as you carry me along; We all love our cow boys so young and so handsome, We all love our cow boys although they've done wrong. In another valedictory the cow boy spirit, after reciting the perils of "some bad company" which could only lead to being "doomed for hell," ended in the presence of the hangman with an admo- nition to morality. It's now I'm on the scaffold, My moments are not long; You may forget the singer But don't forget the song. In the cow boy's lonely character there were extremes of feeling and behavior. If in his work there seemed to be a discipline of dedicated steadfastness, a purity of vo- cation, then when he went to town, he threw himself into indulgence. Perhaps southwest Review 293</page><page sequence="10">the town was a reminder of the coherent social life he had fled at home, and per- haps it was now a guilty joy to outrage it by his behavior. Certainly the town was the very opposite of the desolate open range from which even the cow boy needed periodic change. His best chance for it came when men of the range party were told off to drive a herd of cattle to the marketing and ship- ping towns. The main trails along which he drove went north from the Texan Rio Grande to Kansas, and another - the Goodnight-Loving T rail - led westward to New Mexico and California. It passed the Pecos River at Horsehead Crossing about a hundred miles above the Rio Grande, and presently divided into two forks. One pointed north to Colorado. The other crossed the Rio Grande at Las Cruces and followed the old road to San Diego. The cattle made trails that showed many narrow grooves side by side - marks of the strict formation in which the ani- mals in their thousands were driven for upwards of a thousand miles. A cow boy said that trail life was "wonderfully pleas- ant" - this in spite of continuing hazards. There still might be trouble with Indians. All the cattle were wild, and were easily stampeded by attacks, or by thunder- storms, or by hail. If the weather was wet, rivers rose, and to take thousands of cat- tle across swollen waters was at best a tedious job, and often a perilous one. Against the drovers on the move there pressed at one period a whole organized enterprise of thievery. Outlaws captured drovers, tortured them, sometimes killed them, and stole their herds. When one drover was captured, he tried to talk his way out of his trouble, but the bandits were immovable and a reporter of the in- cident said bitterly that "it was like preaching morality to an alligator." But in swelling volume the animal trains passed through to their destinations, and the cow boys were happy on the trail. They played tricks on one another, and shot game on the prairies, and after sup- per sang, told stories, danced to a fiddle, lay back to look at the stars and speculate about them, and listened for the sounds of the herd settling down for the night. "I do not know anything more whole- some and satisfying," mused a cow boy long after his trail days, "than seeing cat- tle come in on their bed ground at night so full and contented that they grunt when they lie down." It was like a com- munion of creature comforts in which man and animal could meet. Three shifts of night guards were posted over the herds. A sleepy cow boy rubbed tobacco juice in his eyes to keep awake. Morning must come, and another day to be spent at the pace of cattle walking with odd delicacy in their narrow grooved trails, and after enough such days, the shipping town would take form like a few scat- tered gray boxes on the severe horizon, and the cow boy would feel his various hungers begin to stir. It was in town that he got into most of his trouble. Every facility was there to help him do it. As a cattle shipper ob- served, in frontier towns "there are al- ways to be found a number of bad char- acters, both male and female; of the very worst class in the universe, such as have fallen below the level of the lowest type 294 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="11">of brute creation." These pandered to the cow boy's howling appetite for dissi- pation. Sometimes he rode into town and with- out cleaning himself or changing his clothes but just as he had dismounted in hat, damp shirt, earth-caked trousers, and boots and spurs, he strode into a dance house, seized a "calico queen" or a "painted cat," as he called the dancing women, and with Indian yells and a wild eye went pounding about the dance floor under a grinding necessity to prove in public, most of all to himself, that he was at last having a good time. The music to which he danced was "wretched . . . ground out of dilapidated instruments, by beings fully as degraded as the most vile. Few more wild, reckless scenes of abandoned debauchery can be seen on the civilized earth," remarked the cattle ship- per, "than a dance house in full blast in one of the many frontier towns. To say they dance wildly or in an abandoned manner is putting it mild. ..." And sometimes the cow boy, at large in town with his accumulated pay, went first to improve his looks. In a barber- shop he had a bath, and then had his three to six months' growth of hair trimmed, and his full beard cut down, shaped, and dyed black. In a clothing store he bought completely new clothes, from hat to boots; and then, strapping on his pistol, he was ready to impose himself like shock upon the town. Gambling rooms, saloons, a theater, a row of prostitutes' quarters like cattle stalls, dance houses - from one to the next the cow boy could make his explosive way, to be catered to by "men who live a soulless, aimless life," and women who had "fallen low, alas! how low . . . miserable beings." Among the conventions of the cow boy's town man- ners was free use of his firearm, whether he might harm anyone or not. The pathos of folly long done and half forgotten would make his murderous antics seem unreal to later view. But they were real enough to the frontier towns of the 18 70 's. Sighed the cattle shipper in that decade, It is idle to deny the fact that the wild, reck- less conduct of the cow boys while drunk . . . have brought the personnel of the Texan cat- tle trade into great disrepute, and filled many graves with victims, bad men and good men. . . . But by far the larger portion of those killed are of that class that can be spared with- out detriment to the good morals and respec- tability of humanity. . . . And "after a few days of frolic and debauchery, the cow boy is ready, in com- pany with his comrades, to start back to Texas, often not having one dollar left of his summer's wages." All he had was a memory that found its way into one of his songs, about "The way we drank and gambled and threw the girls around. ..." The cow boy triumphed at a lonely work in a beautiful and dangerous land. Those of his qualities that did the job were the good ones - courage, strength, devotion to duty. His worse traits, exer- cised for relief, were not judged in rela- tion to his task. All aspects of his complex nature entered into his romance. He saw himself for his own achievement, and like the earliest individuals of the frontier, he consciously created his character and his tradition, and whether his emotion southwest Review 295</page><page sequence="12">was honest or not, it was so energetic that by it he made his nation see him in his own terms. In him, the last American to live a life of wild freedom, his domesti- cated compatriots saw the end of their historical beginnings, and paid him nos- talgic tribute in all their popular arts. Soon, like them, he would lose his no- madic, free, and rough form of life be- fore the westward sweep of machine tech- niques by which Americans made their lives physically more easy - and socially less independent and self-reliant. In the very exercise of their genius for conven- ience in living, the Americans sacrificed to the social and commercial patterns of mass techniques some part of the personal liberty in whose name the nation had been founded. The cow boy in his choice of solitude held on to his whole liberty as long as he could. But domestication of his West by machine techniques began in the 1860's and, once started, went fast. For in response to such techniques, the cattle industry grew with suddenness, and then became stabilized. The first of these was the westward advance of the railroads with which the northbound cat- tle drives could make a junction. It was not easy to arrange for the earliest rail transport of western cattle. A young Illi- nois cattle shipper who was the first to establish a livestock market in Kansas was astonished to have his new idea rejected by two railroad presidents and the lead- ing businessmen of several Kansas towns to whom he went in turn. Finally the Hannibal &amp; St. Joe Railroad gave the young shipper a contract "at very satis- factory rates of freight from the Missouri River to Quincy, thence to Chicago." He selected Abilene, Kansas, as the site for his stockyards, and in 1867 the first cat- tle were driven there from Texas. During the next four years 1,460,000 head of cat- tle were brought to Abilene. Other trails and shipping centers were soon estab- lished, and it was estimated that during a period of twenty-eight years nearly ten million cattle worth almost a hundred million dollars were moved from the Texas ranges to market. In the process of developing so great a business, the whole practice of cattle raising became formal- ized through changes that sought greater efficiency. One of these used a technical machine product that soon conquered the open range where wild cattle once drifted ac- cording to weather. It was barbed wire, first used in 1875 to fence pastures in which with fewer and less skilful cow boys the herds could be restricted and more easily managed. When land was enclosed, ranch dwellings were needed. Permanent headquarters buildings followed. Cattle no longer were driven to rivers but found their water in earth tanks supplied by dug wells, with still another machine product to keep it flowing - the metal windmill. The main trunk lines of the railroads ran east to west across the con- tinent; but soon feeder lines were built - sometimes following the flat terrain of the old trails - and machine transporta- tion reached nearer and nearer to the great ranches of the border where the whole cattle industry had had its begin- nings. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad was the great Texas cattle line. It tapped the Rio Grande brush country ranges. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa 296 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="13">Fe main line crossed New Mexico and a branch line ran from Belen on the Rio Grande all the way down the valley to El Paso. The Texas and Pacific reached east- ward from San Diego to El Paso in 1877, and bridges now came back to the Rio Grande to stay. The whole river empire was soon tied to the rest of the nation by rails. When packing houses were estab- lished at Kansas City, Fort Worth, and other southwestern cities, the final pattern of the organized beef cattle industry was realized. In it there was little room for the figure, the temperament, of the original cow boy, with his individual lordship over great unimpeded distances and his need of freedom as he defined it. His cow camp literature recorded yet another stage - the last - of his history. "The cow boy has left the country," he could sing, "and the campfire has gone out. ..." On barbed wire fences, like symbols of the new order of affairs over the con- trolled range lands, dead, skinned coyotes were impaled in a frieze - twenty or thirty of them at a time. They were stretched in mid-air with a lean, racing look of unearthly nimbleness, running nowhere; and their skulled teeth had the smile of their own ghosts, wits of the plains. In the dried varnish of their own amber serum they glistened under the sun. The day of unrestrained predators was over.</page></plain_text>
