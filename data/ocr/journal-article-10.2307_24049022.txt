This impressive work documents the results of rock art survey in the Altai mountain region of Mongolia carried out from 1994 to 2000 by the authors, Esther Jacobson (University of Oregon, USA), Vladimir Kubarev (Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology and Ethnol ogy, Russia), and Damdensurenjin Tseevendorj (Academy of Sciences, Institute of History, Mon golia). Together these three scholars and their field teams make up the Mongolian-American Russian (MAR) "Altay" Project, which has not only set an important precedent for international collaboration but has also made available in these volumes a superb database of petroglyphic im ages from a region little known among Western researchers. Above and beyond these contribu tions to Inner Asian archaeology and art history, what gives this work a truly remarkable depth is the use of multiple lines of evidence and perspec tives for understanding images, landscape, and culture over time. The MAR "Altay" Project was one of the ear liest of a small number of joint archaeological expeditions to take advantage of the scientific opening of Mongolia in the early 1990s. The proj ect's specific research questions on ancient Altay rock art made the far northwestern province of Mongolia, Bayan Ôlgiy, a likely region for in vestigation. The Altay mountain chain runs the length of Bayan Ôlgiy province and articulates the borders of Mongolia, Russia, and China. Ba yan Ôlgiy has an austere mountain steppe en vironment of high altitudes and unpredictable weather, and because of its remote location, the province received comparatively little attention from archaeologists. In 1989 and 1990, Mongo lian archaeologists began the first province-wide mapping survey to record archaeological sites throughout Bayan Ôlgiy using both pedestrian and jeep survey and relying on the knowledge of local herders to locate archaeological features. The MAR Project continued this survey effort in 1994 with an emphasis on recording petro glyphic sites along the major river valleys of the province. The focus of these volumes is an ex tensive rock art site, Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor (TS/BO), which has proven to be one of the most promising discoveries of the provincial survey. After selecting this site in 1995 for more thor ough documentation, Jacobson, Tseveendorj, and Kubarev soon found themselves confronted with an unexpected quantity of pecked images num bering in the thousands and a cultural record that spans more than ten millennia. The site of TS/BO is situated in the northwest corner of Bayan Ôlgiy province, near the Russian border, and consists of petroglyphic images along a 20 km section above and below the conflu ence of the Tsagaan Salaa and Baga Oigor rivers. The river valleys are at approximately 2,300 2,400 meters in elevation and include a number of archaeological surface features such as buri als, "kheregsur" complexes with enclosures and altars, stone rings, and ritual mounds, many of which coincide with spatial clusters of rock art. What makes this site distinctive and important is not only the co-occurrence and likely asso ciation of surface features and images but also the density of images and the time range they represent. Though there is some debate among the co-authors over the character and dating of the earliest images at TS/BO, if Jacobson and Tseveendorj are correct in their identification of mammoth petroglyphs at the site, then the ma jority of artistic and ritual activities in these river valleys were carried out from the late Pleistocene (prior to 10,000 cal yr B.P.) through the mid-1st millennium b.c. Kubarev argues that the earliest date attributable to the TS/BO site is early to middle Holocene (Neolithic), but in the absence of reliable and independent dating methods for open-air sites, rock art periodization will always be characterized by such disagreements. These volumes, however, attest to the advantages of moving beyond arguments over dating and ty pology and employing available sets of evidence in order to take full advantage of what Jacobson calls, "... an extraordinary laboratory in which to study the ecology of culture . . . from Paleolithic cultures down to the modern period" (vol. 1, p. 3). The introduction to these two volumes de scribes the publication as both documentary and analytical in intent.

The color and black-and-white photo graphic plates are not only splendidly printed, but Gary Tepfer, who did the photographic work for this project, demonstrates an extraordinary tech nical ability and aesthetic sense in capturing the often elusive light of pecked images. While the work clearly succeeds in documenting the TS/ BO site, there are two minor issues that should be mentioned for future consideration, the first of which concerns the need for more detailed sampling information. As Jacobson and Mea cham explain in their methods section, there are far too many images at TS/BO to record each and every one. Therefore, a selection of images was made by the researchers based on an appraisal of quality, interest, and chronology. As with any sample, it is useful for the purposes of both documentation and analysis to have some knowl edge of what was excluded from the sample, and if at all possible, a quantitative measure as suits the conditions of the site in question. The sec ond issue involves the need for a table listing the UTM coordinates, elevation, and all pub lished images related to each TS/BO study point. As GIS software becomes increasingly available to researchers in diverse fields, future readers will certainly want to generate their own maps and spatial analyses using these data. Neither sampling nor spatial information is given much attention in these volumes, though I am confi dent that we can look forward to having these issues discussed and data presented in up-coming publications. In preparing this work, Professors Jacobson, Kubarev, and Tseveendorj had originally hoped to create a model for the future documentation and analysis of Central and North Asian rock art. They have succeeded admirably in this ob jective and have achieved far more than pro viding simply a good example, in my opinion. These volumes are a remarkable demonstration of the value of international partnership, multi ple perspectives, and the use of varied kinds of evidence for the exploration of ancient socie ties, their organization, and beliefs. In making the Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor petroglyphs avail able to researchers around the world, these three co-authors have done an inestimable service to us all.
