Reviewed by Judith Sterner The "exuberantly gynecomorphic furnaces of Central Africa" with their "breasts, navels, scarification patterns, and beaded belts" inspired Eugenia Herbert to begin the difficult task of assembling the extensive and diverse materials that have resulted in Iron, Gender and Power. The often overtly female characteristics of the furnaces or the more subtle actions and the rituals invoking "male appropriation of reproduction" that must, she argues, accom- pany any iron smelt caused her to investigate the cosmologies that underlie "technologies of transformation." This book is about power. The author discusses the problems inherent in this concept, offering a definition that "em- phasizes the means by which selected individ- uals are thought to gain access to and control over people and resources through their mas- tery of transformative processes." Age and gender, essential elements of the human expe- rience, form the twin axes on which her model of power is based. As a fieldworker who has been struggling with some of the same issues, I found the book stimulating, challenging, and at times frustrating. As I read it I found myself con- stantly stopping to think about what Herbert was proposing, and to relate it to my own experience in the Mandara mountains of north Cameroon and northeastern Nigeria. I was challenged to pull together my data on metallurgy, and in particular on pottery, to test the applicability of her theory of power to my small part of sub-Saharan Africa. The comprehensive introduction (tech- niques and cosmology) elaborates on the concepts discussed above. The rest of the book, save for a final chapter, is divided into two parts, the first titled "Those Who Play with Fire: African Metallurgy as Epic Drama." In these five chapters smelters and smiths are considered from the point of view of "what they do." In the following three chapters that constitute the second part, "Symmetries and Asymmetries: Power and Fertility," she explores the metaphor of trans- formation in three other technologies-king- making, hunting, and potting. A concluding chapter ponders "Anthropomorphism and the Genderization of Power." The goal of this project is ambitious: to syn- thesize the diverse materials on these technolo- gies for all of sub-Saharan Africa and to propose a theory of power derived from this material. Herbert pursues this attempt while recognizing two problems encountered in tak- ing such a broad approach: 1) the data she seeks are available for only a tiny fraction of sub-Saharan African groups, and 2) even where for any one group there is good infor- mation on one of the technologies, it is extremely rare for there to be comparable data on the others. She also stresses that even within a single ethnic group there may be variation. Herbert is looking for the similarities underlying variation, and from ethnographic fragments hopes to put together an explana- tory model that is widely applicable in sub- Saharan Africa (and in bold moments perhaps even beyond!). She argues that iron smelting "provides the primary arena in which ideas of transformation are played out," and that knowledge derived from it can "illuminate other technologies of transformation." Essen- tially, then, she is dealing with four technolo- gies: metallurgy (smelting and smithing), royal investiture, hunting, and potting. Only the last is a predominantly female activity. Herbert makes clear that smelting is no longer practiced (and in some places was never performed), and thus many of its tech- niques and accompanying rituals are "frozen in time." Smithing continues, thriving in many regions, but the iron worked is differ- ent; smiths all over sub-Saharan Africa have adjusted to the changed medium of imported metal and to a subtractive rather than an addi- tive forging process. As kingdoms and chief- doms have been incorporated into colonial and more recently nation states, royal investi- ture has lost some of its potency. Hunting, too, becomes less frequent as economies and envi- ronments change. Thus all three of the male- dominated transformative technologies have disappeared, declined, or been significantly altered. Potting, on the other hand, has sur- vived, in many regions relatively unchanged. Yet it is not as intensively ritualized as the other three, and neither the technology nor the product secures for the producer the same status. If this is indeed the case-and it can at least be questioned from my Mandara per- spective-Herbert's task is all the more diffi- cult, since she cannot reasonably extrapolate from potting to the other activities. Nonetheless, Herbert has produced a valu- able work that is at once bold and cautious. It is bold in applying a theory of power to all of sub-Saharan Africa, yet cautious in clearly acknowledging the exceptions to the argument and in stating where information is insuffi- cient. Herbert's synthesis closes one chapter in the study of African metallurgy, and opens the way for a new generation of studies. These will surely approach the transformative technolo- gies at a local or regional level, enabling us to see how they interrelate socially and culturally within circumscribed contexts. While working in the Mandara, I have, for example, been struck by the many similarities between the rituals associated with furnaces, forges, potter's equipment, and firing pits- and also granaries. Such relationships demand exploration in detail that will surely reveal a complexity and uniqueness of metaphor that may well not be representative of the pan- African themes that Herbert detects in the evi- dence available to date. Another question is the appropriateness of assimilating ceramics to the other tech- nologies. Until recently most studies of pot- ting were determinedly focused on its utilitarian or artistic aspects. Thus it may be that Herbert's emphasis on the public as- pects of power and degree of ritualization, little expressed in potting or at least little recorded, results in an underestimation of women's powers. We also need to know more about "indigenous beliefs concerning conception, pregnancy, birth or sexuality." 18 african arts * summer 1995</page><page sequence="2">This is yet another reason for undertaking studies of single societies or intraregional comparisons. Herbert is well aware of such concerns, and stresses that the hypotheses she presents in her conclusion are "meant to be a challenge rather than an assertion, a plea for more work to confirm, refute, or modify." She has presented us with the base from which to take up this challenge-and that is the strength of her book. The appendix on reconstructions of iron smelting in Africa and her extensive bibliogra- phy will be of lasting value. The index includes names of ethnic groups, concepts, and uses (e.g., of chickens in divination), though not of the authors who have contributed to her data- base. With the unfortunate exceptions of the maps-which frankly are awful-and certain figures (two with tiny captions in Portuguese!), the book is well produced and organized. The black and white photographs, many historical, demonstrate the wide variety of furnace types and their attributes. Other photographs illus- trate themes regarding smelting/smithing regalia, hunters and royal symbols, and an- thropomorphic pottery. In short this is a brave attempt, and a worthy one, to explore the deeper meanings of African metallurgy. It deserves its place on the shelves of all those interested in the arts, material culture, and history of sub- Saharan Africa. O</page></plain_text>
