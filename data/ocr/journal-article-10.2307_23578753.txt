This first volume is itself a major contribution to systematic theology, significant both in the extent and depth with which Pannenberg treats a host of complex theological problems such as the relation between philosophical and theological concepts of God, the role of naturai theology, the place of the religions in thinking about God, the divine attributes, a systematic elaboration of trinitarian theology. On the one hand, one notices a remarkable consistency with Pannenberg's earlier writings. Certain key concepts such as the historical nature of reality, the centrality of the category of the future, the nature of man as exocentric being, continue to play a decisive role in his thinking. On the other hand, a number of points such as his trinitarian theology are clarified in far greater detail than in anything Pannenberg has heretofore published.1 It is the goal of this article to offer a presentation of some key themes of Pannenberg's systematic presentation of the doctrine of God, focusing on Systematis che Theologie I but reading this work in the light of earlier essays on the same themes. At the same time I hope to offer some criticai reflections on Pannenberg's approach where his presentation seems in danger of surrendering essential aspects of the Christian understanding of God, indicating as well where certain Protestant principles cause difficulty for a Catholic theologian who wishes to learn from Pannenberg's vast erudition and power of synthesis. 1 In Jesus, God and Man (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1968), for example, the trinitarian implications of Christology are only tentatively sketched. See, for example, pp. 177-179.</page><page sequence="2">74 JOHN O'DONNELL, S.I. The Nature of Dogmatics and the Claim to Truth One of the first striking impressions in reading Pannenberg is his concern with truth. Christian faith makes a claim to truth. This claim brings it immediately into the open forum where it must enter into confrontation with other truth claims. Such a claim to truth at once precludes any type of ghetto-approach to faith. Christian theology can adopt no other stance than openness to dialogue. As regards the nature of dogmatics, Pannenberg writes, Dogmatics interprets the truth claim of Christian doctrine: it ex plains how the inner coherence of doctrine must be understood so that it can be accepted as true.2 However, in clarifying the nature of dogmatics and its relation to truth Pannenberg makes a number of points which are both historically illuminating and theologically relevant. First, he notes the peculiar situation in which modem systematic thinking about God takes place. For the last two hundred years Christian theology has taken place in an atmosphere determined by the Enlightenment. Since the Enlighten ment, philosophy has made us aware of the historicity of our being and the time-bound character of ali our assertions. In this context how can one make absolute claims to truth? Can an historical event have absolute significance? Are we not limited to making hypothetical claims which must be tested against historical evidence? On the one hand, Pannenberg accepts the challenge of relativity. For him, both Protestant and Catholic theology tried to escape this facticity but unsuccessfully. The escape-hatch for Protestant theology was the theory of inspiraiion. The Scriptures are inspired and therefore are the Word of God. This divine inspiration guarantees their absolute claim to truth. But Pannen berg argues that this guarantee collapsed with the discovery of the historical character of the texts themselves. Catholic theology tried to escape from the challenge of relativity by accepting an infallible teaching magisterium. Pannenberg sees in this an unacceptable deus ex machina. What then is one to do? How can one maintain Christianity's claim to absoluteness and at the same time acknowledge the historicity of truth? Pannenberg's response is subtle. On the one hand, dogmatic 2 W.

According to modem scientific method, dogmatics must treat the propositions of faith as hypotheses to be tested. In this, Pannenberg breaks definitively with the classical tradition of theology. On the other hand, what must be tested is precisely the truth claim, that is, the claim to absoluteness, of the propositions of faith themselves. To understand this last assertion, we must unpack a bit Pannen berg's understanding of truth. In Systematische Theologie I Pannenberg builds on the theory of truth which he elaborated in earlier writings such as his essay, "What is Truth?".3 It seems to me that one can make two fundamental assertions about Pannenberg's approach to truth. First, he proposes a coherence theory of truth in the Hegelian tradition, i.e. we can only speak about the truth in terms of the totality. The Truth is the Whole. But secondly, since we are historical beings, we never have access to the totality as such. Here Pannenberg faults Hegel for presuming to step outside of history and glimpse an overview of the totality.4 Rather our access to the truth is always immersed in history. But being in history, we are nonetheless able to anticipate the future. Indeed Pannenberg would argue that in every experience of our finitude we anticipate the final future into which we are drawn. Here one can note that Pannenberg is influenced by Dilthey's theory of meaning according to which ali meaning is contextual.5 Every finite, relative meaning has meaning by reference to the Totality. As Pannenberg would argue, every word of our language has meaning only by being inserted into a context. But when the meaning of an individuai word is 3 W. Pannenberg, "What is Truth?", in Basic Questions in Theology, Voi. 2 (London: SCM, 1971), pp. 1-27. 4 For Pannenberg's critique of Hegel, see ibid., p. 22; ST 1, p. 408; "Die Subjektivitàt Gottes und die Trinitatslehre. Ein Beitrag zur Beziehung zwischen Karl Barth und der Philosophie Hegels," in Grundfragen Systematischer Theologie, Band II (Gòttingen: Vanderhoeck und Ruprecht, 1980), pp. 105ff. 5 See, for example, W. Pannenberg, "Den Glauben an ihm fassen und verstehen," in Zeitschrift fiir Theologie und Kirche 86 (1989), ρ. 360. E. JOngel, following the line of criticism of Falk Wagner's, VFoì Ist Religion? Studien zu ihrem Begriff und Thema in Geschichte und Gegenwart (1986), asks whether we can grasp the totality of historical reality, whether such a totality does not remain merely a gedachtes Ganzes and not a Reales Ganzes. Wagner accuses Pannenberg of surreptitiously introducing a thought totality for a real totality. According to Pannenberg, what is at stake here is the nature of anticipation. For Pannenberg, the tension between anticipating form and anticipated reality belongs to the structure of anticipation itself. He argues that every concept is structured through anticipation. For Jungel's criticism, see "Nihil divinitatis, ubi non fides," in Zeitschrift fur Theologie und Kirche 86 (1989), pp. 229-230; see also Pannenberg's response, art. cit., pp. 360-364.</page><page sequence="4">76 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. looked at in its depths, this meaning opens out to the Totality which is the absolute future. As he puts it in his essay, "Faith and Reason," "When someone names a thing and says, 'This is a rose,' or 'This is a dog,' he always does so from the standpoint of an implicit foreconcep tion of the final future, and of the totality of reality that will first be constituted by the final future. For every individuai has its definitive meaning only within this whole."6 In Systematische Theologie I he puts it this way, The naming word — and more decisively the sentence which as an assertion makes a claim to truth and thus implies the coherence of everything which is trae — always proceeds from an anticipation of the Totality of reality which is as yet stili unfulfilled; and the spoken word as event therefore always in some way implies God as the Ground of the Totality, if it is trae that the totality of the world and the entirety of human existence have their foundation in God (pp. 276-277). From this perspective we can already see that the event of language requires a religious interpretation. Any sentence which claims to be true can make this claim only within the context of truth itself. If this is valid for human language in general, it is ali the more true for Christian assertions which proclaim an experience of God by anticipation in the experience of Jesus and his resurrection. For Christian faith the resurrection of Jesus is the decisive event of meaning in that in this event (so it is claimed) the absolute future of the world which we cali God is known by anticipation. At the same time, however, it is clear that until the eschaton ali such affirmations have a provisionai status. They are hypotheses that must be tested. And this is precisely the task of dogmatic theology: to test these assertions of faith with respect to their claim to truth. As regards the centre of faith, namely the affirmation of the reality of God, Pannenberg's doctrine leads to the position that the Christian experience of God must be tested in confrontation with the claims of other 'gods' as well as in confrontation with the claim that there is no god. However, dogmatics can never hope to complete its task once and for ali. Because of the historical nature of reality its task of testing will never have final closure as long as history continues. Only in the eschaton will it be demonstrated beyond doubt that God is God. W. Pannenberg, "Faith and Reason," in Basic Questions in Theology, Voi. 2, ρ. 62.</page><page sequence="5">PANNENBERGS DOCTRINE OF GOD 77 Relation Between Philosophy and Theology Since both philosophy and theology claim to apprehend reality and since indeed both make claims about the ultimate ground of reality, there must be an intrinsic relation between them. Christian theology must perforce be open to an investigation of the truth claims of philosophy. Throughout Pannenberg's career one of the primary targets of his theological writings has been the Barthian dialectical theology which bases ali truth upon the revelation of God through his Word. The Barthian position, Pannenberg maintains, is ultimately fideistic. It is part of a desperate attempi to rescue Christian faith from the onslaught of the Enlightenment. With the collapse of the Protestant principle of scriptural exegesis, the Barthians can guarantee the truth of Christian revelation only by an irrational leap of faith. But such an approach plays into the hands of Feuerbach and his projection theory of religion. Barth has not offered a response to this critique and his position is just as anthropocentric as Feuerbach's. Truth for Barth is grounded in the human act of faith. Pannenberg argues that Feuerbach's challenge can only be met by developing a metaphysical anthropology which shows that the religious dimension is a constitutive dimension of the human. If both philosophy and theology make claims about the ultimate reality, what is the relation between them? Is theology to be reduced to the handmaid of philosophy? First of ali, Pannenberg would argue that ali knowledge of God must proceed from God's self-disclosure (S.T. 1, p. 83). Throughout his writings there recurs the leitmotiv: God is only known where he makes himself known. This means that in the first instance one should look to the experiences of the religions which claim to transmit a self-disclosure of God. But as we have seen, such self-disclosures are not immune to philosophical reflection but rather invite it. The role of philosophy is two-fold. On the one hand, philosophy has to do with the thinkability of God. The philosophy of God seeks to explore the minimal conditions for saying anything about God. On the other hand, philosophy has a criticai function. Philosophy does not think in a vacuum. The philosophy of religion begins with the concrete experiences of the religions and purifies them through criticai reflection, so that the God proclaimed by the religions is coherently thinkable. Thus the relation between philosophy and theology is dialectical. The human person is so constituted that he is open to the Trascendent. But this openness to the Transcendent yields a concrete idea of God through the mediation of a religious tradition. The religious</page><page sequence="6">78 JOHN O'DONNELL, S.I. tradition in turn invites philosophical reflection so that the idea of God is shown to be intelligible and non-contradictory. One can see the relationship concretely in the history of Christianity.7 The Christian faith was implanted in a world where there were already prevailing ideas about deity. In the intellectual world of Hellenistic philosophy God was conceived as so transcendent to the world as to be impassible, immut able and a-temporal. The biblical revelation shattered these philo sophical pre-conceptions of God. On the basis of Christian faith the believer was challenged to pose anew the question of the relation of transcendence and immanence, time and eternity, beatitude and suffer ing. But the Christian revelation did not annui the philosophical questions. Rather these questions became more acute. For Christian faith as well as for Hellenistic religion and philosophy, the problem remains how to think God and the world together in such a way as to preserve God's trascendence without abrogating the value of the world. If, as Pannenberg affirms, for both philosophy and theology, God is "die alles bestimmende Wirklichkeit" (S.T. 1, p. 175), then the pressing problem is how God can be ali and stili give place to the world. Are we doomed either to think in terms of dualism or in terms of a monism where human freedom has no place? Christian theology cannot answer these questions without the aid of philosophy. Thus, as Pannenberg perceptively observes, for Christian faith the problems of philosophical theology do not go away. Rather the Christian revelation of God spurs philosophy to rethink the nature of reality anew and indeed Pannenberg would argue that this revelation brings the philosophical question to a genuine fulfillment for the first time.8 Anthropological Basis of Religion In developing his philosophy of religion, Pannenberg tries to steer a middle position between two extremes. On the one hand he seeks to avoid a rationalism according to which one can demonstrate the existence of God through theoretical arguments. Here Pannenberg maintains that there is no going back behind the Kantian critique. As we noted above, God can only be known through his self-revelation. On the other hand, Pannenberg sees the need to overcome the Feuer 7 See Pannenberg's essay, "The Appropriation of the Philosophical Concepì of God as a Dogmatic Problem of Early Christian Theology," in Basic Questions in Theology, Voi. 2, pp. 119-183. 8 See ibid., ρ. 182.</page><page sequence="7">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 79 bachian genetic explanation of religion. Thus Pannenberg seeks to establish the basis for religion in a philosophical anthropology. Anthropology can and must show that man inevitably raises the question of God because man is an openness to the Transcendent which Pannenberg understands as the Absolute Future. The basis for Pannen berg's position is his understanding of man as an exocentric being. As early as his book What Is Man? ( Was Ist der Mensch? Die Anthropologie der Gegenwart im Lichte der Theologie, 1962) Pannenberg contrasted human being with that of the animals. The animals have a limited openness beyond themselves. This realm of openness is called environ ment. Man by contrast experiences an openness without limits. This infinite openness is called the world. But as an ecstatic being his openness to the world reveals precisely that the world is a horizon without an horizon. Man is not only openness to the world but openness beyond the world. In chapter one of What Is Man? entitled "Openness to the World and Openness to God," Pannenberg observes, Man does not simply respond to the pressures of his surplus drives by creating for his longing and awe an imaginary object beyond every possible thing in the world. Rather, in this infinite dependence he presupposes with every breath he takes a corresponding, infinite, never ending, otherwordly being before whom he stands, even if he does not know what to cali it.9 Pannenberg has not substantially changed this position in the thirty years between What is Man? and Systematische Theologie I, but in his latest work he has made an important clarification. In this later work he continues to maintain that man is necessarily referred to the Infinite but Pannenberg does not believe that this anthropological fact alone warrants our calling the Infinite, God. According to Pannenberg, this primordial experience of the Infinite is a vague intuition, that is, the intuition of an infinite horizon which Pannenberg describes as an "unbestimmtes da" (S.T. I, p. 384). This vague intuition which is experienced from earliest childhood is only later clarified in terms of an idea of God. But the Infinite can be described as God only through the concrete mediation of a religious tradition. In assuming this position, Pannenberg aligns himself with Walter Kasper's critique of the Rahne rian transcendental philosophy. Rahner too develops the anthropolog W. Pannenberg, What is Man? (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1970), ρ. 10.</page><page sequence="8">80 JOHN O'DONNELL, S.I. ical basis of religion in terms of the subject's openness to the Infinite but Rahner goes on to define the term of human transcendence as God. By contrast, Kasper maintains that human transcendence as such is ambi guous and can be interpreted in a theistic, pantheistic or atheistic way. Like Pannenberg, Kasper argues that the true resolution of human transcendence can come only through history.10 Before terminating this section, we can note in conclusion that in Pannenberg's major work, Anthropology in Theological Perspective, he makes even more precise the genesis of the religious experience. In this work as in many of his essays, Pannenberg enters into dialogue with German idealism. One of the striking features of this magnum opus is the confrontation which Pannenberg makes between philosophical idealism and the empirical science of psychology. For German idealism, the fundamental reality is that of the Ego which is understood as self-consciousness. For Fichte, the primordial event is the self-positing of the Ego. German idealism is thus a philosophy of self-consciousness where the Ego as self-consciousness is defined as Geist. If the fun damental reality is self-consciousness, then the problem becomes how to account for the reality of otherness. In Anthropology in Theological Perspective, building on the contribution of psychoanalysis and of Mead's social psychology, Pannenberg shows that the ego is not the primary reality. The Τ is preceded by the self which is socially constituted by the roles which society assigns. The permanent Τ is not given with birth but the identity of the Τ has to be established through a process of identity-formation. According to Pannenberg, the perma nent Τ is the result of the identification (completed in self consciousness) of the spontaneous I-moments with the continuous unity of the self. But what makes the individuai capable of this self-identification? Psychology answers that ego formation is possible because of the individual's identification with a sphere of familiarity which is more inclusive than the individuai and connects the individuai with its environment so closely that only secondarily does it delimit its self and its ego within this sphere. Psychologists have shown that the first stage of this development is the identification of the child with its mother. In this experience of identification are laid the foundations for a more intensive experience of the world. 10 See W. Kasper, The Godof Jesus Christ (London: SCM, 1984), pp. 52-53, 86; Jesus the Christ (London: Burns and Oates, 1977), pp. 48-52.</page><page sequence="9">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 81 But what is important here for the anthropological foundations of religion is the fact that from the child's primordial symbiotic bond with the mother there emerges the phenomenon of basic trust. For the child this fundamental trust is concretized in the mother. But the mother does not exhaust the reality of trust, she is rather the first in a series of mediations of trust. Through these mediations the child comes to believe that reality as such is trustworthy. But reality is trustworthy only if the real as such or the source of reality is trustworthy, that is, only if God is the source of reality. Thus Pannenberg argues that through concrete mediations of trust the Τ is formed. In these mediations the Ί' anticipates the Final Reality which is the source and ground of trust. In fragmentary ways the Ί' has an experience of the presence of the true and the definitive in the midst of the provisional. This experience of the presence of the Absolute Future by anticipation Pannenberg terms Geist.11 The Signifìcance of the Religions Pannenberg first offered a reflection on the theological signifìcance of the world religions in an early eSsay entitled, "Toward a Theology of the History of Religions."12 In chapter 3 of Systematische Theologie I he remains faithful to his earlier position, while at the same time deepening and nuancing it. We have already seen that Pannenberg interprets human transcendence in a religious way. But man's openness to the Absolute Future remains abstract unless there is the concrete mediation of the religions. Moreover, the fact that the religions have existed since the beginning of human history points to the fact that religion is a constitutive dimension of the human: How then should we interpret the function of the religions, especially in light of the variety and plurality of the religious traditions? What sense should we make of the religions theologically? First, Pannenbrg is skeptical of the phenomenological approach to the religions which tries to reduce their multiplicity to some common unifying factor. He argues that we must accept the religions in their diversity. Secondly, he is skeptical of an evolutionary conception which 11 See W. Pannenberg, Anthropology in Theological Perspective (Edinburgh: Τ. and Τ. Clark, 1985), ρ. 519. 12 W. Pannenberg, "Toward a Theology of the History of Religions," in Basic Questions in Theology, Voi. 2, pp. 65-118.</page><page sequence="10">82 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. sees monotheism as the high-point of a development from primitive types of animism. For Pannenberg, the heart of the religions is the manifestation of the divine power through divine intervention or action in history. The religions arise through the experience of the manifestation of a god's power on behalf of a people. The history of the religions can be interpreted as the history of the conflicting claims as to the power of the gods. Which god is really more powerful and hence reliable? Each religious tradition has claimed that its god is more powerful. At the same time, within the history of a given tradition, the god had to be evoked ever anew to show his power. Historically speaking, with the arrivai of the Judaic-Christian faith ali other gods disappeared before the claims of the one God of the great monotheistic faiths. Polytheism ceased to be a living option. Either the God of Moses, Jesus and Mohammed is the only God or there is no god. Nonetheless the claims of the Christian faith in God stili have to be tested. The God whom Christians have experienced in Jesus must continue to prove himself powerful and hence reliable. And the challenge to the Christian claim about God becomes ali the more urgent today in the face of the apparent meaningless suffering of individuals and of massive portions of the human race. A particular feature of Pannenberg's treatment of the religions is that he links the question of the unity of the religions, culminating in monotheism, with that of the unity of humankind. In fact, historically speaking, it was the rise of monotheism which made the world a unified world for the first time. Only with the emergence of the Judaic Christian faith did individuai peoples transcend their particular cultures and create a universal culture rooted in the one God of faith. The emergence of monotheism in the Judaic-Christian tradition not only created the possibility of a universal culture but also bestowed meaning on history. The contingent events of history were seen to have sense because they were read in the light of God's revelation of himself in history. History was seen as the pilgrimage of the human race toward the Kingdom of God. Since men and women knew the goal toward which they were moving, they could see the sense of what they were living, even when the meaning of events was clouded by suffering and tragedy. The one God as the Ultimate Future of history guaranteed the unity of historical events. With the loss of Christian faith and the process of secularization, man no longer feels at home in the cosmos, for he does not see the sense of his history. Secularization has liberated</page><page sequence="11">PANNENBERG'S D0CTRINE OF GOD 83 him from pre-established meaning but it has placed on his shoulders the burden of creating meaning for the cosmos. This burden is too heavy to bear and so arouses in him the sense of anxiety in the face of his own groundless freedom. The Christian, however, is able to look at the history of the religions as the providental preparation of God for the revelation of his essence. In the conflict of the gods of the religions with their competing claims for power, the way was prepared for the revelation of the God of Jesus, a revelation which Pannenberg links in a special way to the resurrection. There God's power over death and Nothing was revealed. God manifested himself as he who created out of nothing, as "die alles bestimmende Wirklichkeit." (S.T. 1, p. 175) In the resurrection of Jesus God's essence is known by anticipation. But the full manifestation of his essence is reserved for the eschaton. Only then will the unity of history in the unity of the one God be definitively revealed. Thus, Pannenberg argues that the problem of the unity of the religions should not be resolved protologically by a look at their origins but rather eschatologi cally by a look at their fulfillment in the God of Jesus Christ. We have stressed that the religions play an essential role in human experience, for there we see the concreteness of the divinity. At the same time, God's revelation of himself in concreteness implies a finitization of the Infinite, which Pannenberg describes as the "Verend lichung des Unendlichen." (S.T. 1, p. 205) In other words, every revelation of God presupposes a medium of revelation and this medium is as such finite. This fact explains why in numerous religions there is the temptation embedded in the religions, namely to absolutize the media tion of the divine revelation. The religions contain an in-built prop ulsion toward magic, namely the desire to control and manipulate the divinity. Pannenberg would argue that the same danger exists within the Christian faith, but in Jesus we see that his claim to be the absolute revelation is not idolatrous precisely because his absolute claim is balanced by his absolute obedience. He claims not to reveal himself but the Father who acts through him. His whole being is a pointer beyond himself to the ever-greater Father. In this sense Jesus perfectly fulfills the function of the religions without falling into the danger of idolatry which they contain. God's Being and History When St. Thomas begins his treatise on God, he commences with the attributes which characterize the divine essence. These attributes</page><page sequence="12">84 JOHN O'DONNELL. S I. can be discerned by reason as the mind proceeds from the creature to the Infinite Source of ali finite being. For Pannenberg our starting point for talking about the being of God must be history. God reveals himself in history. Here a key category is that of divine action. According to the Bible, the self-revelation of God is mediated through God's action in creation, through the judging action of God announced in the prophetic word and most explicitly through God's action in Jesus Christ. But how is the divine action reiated to God's essence? To answer this question, we must clarify the relationship between historicity and being. In general, Pannenberg enunciates the thesis that the future of a being constitutes its essence. Pannenberg argues that we should not think of the essence of a being as static, something which underlies the changes of the being, or as something perduring in spite of accidental changes which do not affect its essence. Rather we cannot think of the being apart from its history. If we apply this philosophical framework to God, we must say that we cannot think of God's essence apart from his history. Or, indeed, God's essence does not exist apart from his history. In developing this line of reflection, is Pannenberg submitting to a Hegelian interpretation of God according to which God needs history in order to be himself? One can see immediately that what is at stake here is the thorny problem of God's relation to the world. First, let us note that Pannenberg wants to walk a delicate line between Hegelianism and dualism. To avoid dualism, Pannenberg wants to think God as the ultimate reality, indeed as "die alles bestimmende Wirklichkeit" (S.T. 1, p. 175) but in such a way that the being of the world is autonomous without falling outside of God. On the other hand, Pannenberg specifically rejects the idea of a becoming God where God and the world constitute a unified process. How then does he approach the problem? First, epistemologically we cannot speak of God's essence in itself apart from God's historical interventions. We know who God is on the basis of his history. This means that the only God there is is the God who has chosen to involve himself in this world. Thus, from the moment of creation God has placed himself in relation and therefore he has made his divinity dependent on his creation. Pannenberg writes, Through the creation of the world as well as through the sending of the Son and the Spirit to be active in it, the Father has made himself dependent in his divinity on the courseof its history (S.T. l,p. 357).</page><page sequence="13">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 85 He notes further that the divinity of the trinitarian God "is at stake in the events of history" (S.T. 1, p. 358). The centrai idea here seems to be that we cannot think of God's Being abstractly. Rather we must think of God's Being concretely on the basis of his history with us. In other words, God in choosing to create and redeem has linked his divinity to the establishment of his Kingdom. The divinity of God, the essence of God and the Reign of God are inseparable. Until God's rule is established, we are not in a position to know the essence of God. His divinity remains contestable. But is this not another version of a finite God, the God of Hegel and the pantheists? Pannenberg would argue no. His God is not a becoming God (see S.T. 1, p. 359). His God is eternai. But the eternity of God for Pannenberg does not mean timelessness; rather God's eternity will be manifested in the eschaton, in the fulfillment of history, where time is taken up into God's eternity. But it is only in the eschaton that God is proved to be the eternai God. God is not the result of history, God does not become in the eschaton what he previously was not. Rather the eschatological fulfillment of history becomes the place where it is decided that God from eternity to eternity is the true and only God. In this sense the eschaton has constitutive significance both for the eternity and for the essence of God. Because of the coming of God's Kingdom and the establishing of his Reign it is decided that God is God, even before the foundation of the world. Naturally this highly originai interpretation of the meaning of eternity and of God's historic ity makes sense only if one accepts Pannenberg's creative re-thinking of the relation of time and eternity. On this account, time and eternity are not contraries as in the Neo-Platonic and Augustinian conceptions. Neither is eternity reduced to temporality as is the danger with the Whiteheadian process approach. Rather God is eternai but in such a way that temporality and historicity contribute to his eternity. God embraces and fulfills ali time within his eternity. But such an affirmation can only be definitely verified in the eschaton. The Trinitarian God One could say that the heart of Pannenberg's problematic in developing the doctrine of God is how to think the divine unity. For the Christian this question is particularly neuralgic because he is convinced that he can only think God's unity in conjunction with his trinitarian being. The problem then is how to relate God's oneness and his threeness.</page><page sequence="14">86 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. First, we can note that any attempi by the Christian to speak about God's being must be rooted in the economy of salvation, in the action of the three divine persons in our history. This starting point already gives a certain priority to the plurality of persons. Pannenberg writes, A foundation for the doctrine of the Trinity must proceed from the way in which the Father, Son and Holy Spirit appear in the event of revelation and relate to one another. In this lies the just demand for grounding the doctrine of the Trinity in the testimony of revelation found in the Scripture, that is, in the economy of salvation (S.T. 1, p. 325). Presupposed here is the identity between economie and immanent Trinity. If God really reveals himself in the Heilsokònomie, there must be an identity between the revelation of himself and his being. However, in the context of what we have already seen of Pannenberg's doctrine, this identity is fully established for Pannenberg only in the eschaton. Only with the completion of the self-revelation of the trinitarian God, can we speak of the essence of the one God. Hence a particular feature of Pannenberg's doctrine is that we must speak of the unity of God in terms of the history of the three persons, not vice-versa. As Pannenberg notes in his discussion with Rahner, we can only speak of the identity of economie and immanent Trinity in the eschaton. The immanent Trinity is itself at stake in the events of history (See S.T. 1, p. 358). Moreover, any attempi to think the unity of God apart from or prior to the Trinity of persons would make the triunity of God superfluous (S.T. 1, p. 318). We must therefore take as our starting point the givenness of the three persons. This methodological point of departure implies that Pannenberg rejects the tradition common since Aquinas of beginning with the divine essence. For Pannenberg we can only talk of the divine essence and the divine properties after we have clarified the nature of the Trinity. If God's Being can only be thought in terms of the three persons, this implies that we cannot think of God's being as a substance nor as a divine subjectivity. To think of God's being as a substance apart from the persons is to create a quaternity in God. To think of God as Absolute Subject from whom the other persons (Logos, Geist) derive is to think of God as one person. Moreover, in idealist philosophy, it is the nature of the Subject to exist for itself. Rather, for Pannenberg, God's being exists only in the three divine persons who exist for each other. There is no divine being or divine unity apart from the persons. Therefore he rejects the Flegelian approach to divine subjectivity</page><page sequence="15">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 87 according to which God is the absolute Ύ. Hegel's trinitarian theology of the Absolute Subject leads to one of two impasses. Either the divine subject is with himself without being identified with the other, an approach which leads to Romanticism, where in the last analysis the romantic Ί' only circles around itself, or the subject really identifies itself with the other, an approach which dissolves the divine subject in history.13 Pannenberg, therefore, resolutely rejects ali attempts to derive the plurality of persons from the divine essence or from the divine subjectivity. For him neither the way of Aquinas nor the way of Hegel offers promise of thinking the trinitarian God. How then does Pannenberg understand the three divine persons of the Trinity? On the one hand, he takes up the classical position that the persons are the relationships. On the other hand, he launches a critique against the tradition in its understanding of the persons as Ursprungsre lationen. According to this tradition, the divine persons are understood in terms of their relations of origin. Thus the Son is defined in terms of his being generated from the Father, the Holy Spirit in terms of being spirated from the Father and the Son. For Pannenberg, this doctrine does not go far enough, because it limits the mutuality of the rela tionships. As we have seen, Pannenberg wants to think the immanent Trinity on the basis of the economy. But in the economy we see, for example, not only that the Son is sent by the Father but also that the Father makes his divinity dependent on the Son, in the sense that the Father makes the coming of his reign dependent on the mission of the Son. Thus we see that the Father is not only active but also receives from the Son. The Son hands over the Kingdom to the Father. Pannenberg makes a similar reflection as regards the Holy Spirit. If, from one point of view, the Spirit proceeds from the Father, and if the Son sends the Spirit, it is equally true, according to the order of the economy, that the Son receives the gift of the Spirit14 Thus Pannenberg argues for a true mutuality of relationships in the Trinity. It is not sufficient to say that the Son and the Spirit proceed from the Father. Rather the Father is also dependent on the Son and the Spirit, for example, for the coming of his Kingdom and for his glorification. Thus, as Pannenberg expresses it, each person of the Trinity is the focus of several relationships (S.T. 1, p. 348). The core, then, of Pannenberg's 13 See W. Pannenberg, "Person und Subjekt," in Grundfragen Systematischer Theo logie, Band II, ρ. 87. 14 For this reason Pannenberg rejects the tradition of the Filioque.</page><page sequence="16">88 JOHN O'DONNELL, S.I. doctrine of the divine persons is that personhood in the Trinity implies mutuality of relationship and mutuality of dependence. This doctrine also implies that the concept of person is not univocal. There is no univocal concept under which one can assume the three persons. One can only describe the persons according to the multiplicity of their mutuai interactions. In summary, in the Trinity, one can only think of the unity of the divine essence in terms of the unity of the divine persons. Each of the persons is identical with the divine essence but only insofar as each person is in mutuai dependence on the other persons. The mutuai dependence of the divine persons on one another not only constitutes their reality as divine persons but constitutes the reality of the divine essence as well. God as Spirti In discussing the nature of God as Spirit, we are effectively opening the discussion of the divine essence. But this poses the problem of our understanding of the divine existence (Dasein) in relation to the divine essence (Wassein). We have already seen that although Pannenberg admits that the human subject as such is an openness to the Infinite, this vague Infinite can be recognized as God only through the concrete experience of the religions. In the case of Christianity, this means that we can only determine the essence of God through the action and interaction of the three divine persons in history. Once again, Pannen berg's eschatological perspective plays a decisive role here. In other words, only in the eschaton, in the consummation of the actions of the three persons, will we be able to explicitate the divine essence. For the present time what we experience are the appearances of the divine essence. But ali such appearances are fragmentary, anticipatory and proleptic. Once more, Pannenberg stresses that we can only know God's essence in relation to his action. There is no immanent Trinity standing behind the economie Trinity. There is no eternai essence lying behind the manifestations. Rather the essence comes to appearance in the action.15 Thus, for Pannenberg, the category of divine action is very important. By analogy with human action we can say that God's action has a goal. In this case the goal of his creating and redeeming activity is to include human beings in his triune life. God, in establishing this goal, 15 "In him (dem einzelnen Daseinsmoment) kommt das Wesen der Sache nur zur Erscheinung." S.T. 1, p. 387.</page><page sequence="17">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 89 not only determines us, he determines himself. God does not want to be God without us. Thus, although God is not under any external necessity to create or redeem a world, and although Pannenberg specifically rejects the idea that God creates out of need (S.T. 1, p. 421), he would equally affirm that we cannot speak of God's essence apart from his relationship to us. This is because God has determined his being to be being for us.16 How then are we to speak of God's Being? If we look at the entire Christian tradition, whether ancient or modem, we see the tendency to define God as Spirit or Geist. As regards the patristic tradition, Pannenberg notes that a significant move of the Church Fathers was to interpret the Johannine affirmation "God is Spirit" (Jn 4,24) in the light of the Plotinian Nous. In the modem period the most significant attempi to identify God as Spirit is found in German idealism. Here God is understood as Absolute Subject, as absolute Self-consciousness. According to Pannenberg, this entire tradition has fateful consequences for the Christian experience of God. For example, as Plotinus himself saw, Nous already includes plurality. There is already the plurality of the relation between Nous and Noeton. This very fact led Plotinus to search for an ultimate unity beyond Nous. The same problematic haunts German idealism. This was most clearly perceived by Fichte. If God is self-conscious and if the world exists, then God's knowledge of self includes knowledge of the world, i.e. an otherness which precludes that God is radically simple and one. This dilemma led Fichte to deny that God is a subject. As he put it, he denied God for the sake of God (see S.T. 1, p. 407). Does this mean that Pannenberg wishes to affirm that God is impersonal? No. But it means, first of ali, that Pannenberg does not want to conceive of God as an Absolute Subject or Person, but as we have already seen, as a community of mutually dependent persons. Secondly, it means that Pannenberg intends to interpret the language of divine intellect and will in a metaphorical way. To say that God has an intellect is an anthropomorphic way of speaking. To speak of God's intellect is not radically different than to speak of God as a rock or a 16 "Gott ist in seiner Ewigkeit aller Zeit gleichzeitig und das Ziel seines Handeln, das Offenbarwerden seiner Herrschaft iiber die Welt seiner Schòpfung, ist nicht Befriedigung eines Mangels in seinem ewigen Wesen, sondern nur die Einbeziehung seiner Geschòpfe in die ewige Gemeinschaft des Sohnes mit dem Vater durch den Geist. Insofern ist das Welthandeln Gottes Wiederholung seiner ewigen Gottheit im Verhàltnis zur Welt." S.T. 1, pp. 421-422.</page><page sequence="18">90 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. bulwark. Moving beyond metaphor, in affirming that God knows the world, we are affirming that nothing escapes him in the entire creation. Everything is present to him and is held fast by him in his presence. But such knowledge of the world is radically different than our finite knowledge of other things. The same can be said of the divine will. We cannot think of God constructing plans and executing them as we do because of our finite freedom. Rather Pannenberg seeks to ground language of the divine will in the phenomenology of religious experi ence whereby the person grasped by a divine self-disclosure has the experience that God wishes something from him. Hence the experience of God is not an impersonal experience, but in seeking to describe the divine nature we must be aware of the danger of anthropomorphism. But if God is not impersonal, nor an Absolute Subject, and if the key to the divine essence are the interrelations of the three persons, is there a model which can help us to describe the divine being? Here Pannenberg appeals to the science of physics which speaks of a universal field of force in relation to which ali material, corpuscular forms are to be considered as secondary manifestations. The divine life, according to this conception, could be considered as a dynamic field which appears equally in ali three persons. We have analogies for this in human communities where there is a community or national spirit which manifests itself in the individuai persons. Thus, we often speak of the spirit of a school, a nation, a religious order etc. The difference, however, is that in the human analogy the persons can withdraw from the common spirit. In the case of the divine life, however, God is Spirit precisely through the dynamic interaction of the persons. The persons do not exist apart from the field nor the field of the divine life apart from the persons. Infinity, Eternity, Omnipotence Pannenberg notes that the abstract notion of God's essence becom es concretely determined through the attributes which are predicated of him. He notes further that the most fundamental of ali the attributes is God's infinity. In Systematische Theologie I Pannenberg returns more than once to the idea of God's infinity. He notes the importance of Gregory of Nyssa's new grounding of the idea of God in the divine infinity rather than in the concepì of a first cause as the Arians argued. He shows how Descartes tried to prove the existence of God by building upon an innate idea of God as the Infinite, which idea functions as the</page><page sequence="19">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 91 condition of possibility for our thinking the finite. In any case, Pannenberg is agreed that God's infinity is the most fundamental of ali his attributes. But having said that, one has really only opened up the problem. For the precise problem is the relation of finite and infinite. How think this relation without denying the value of the finite or thinking of the Infinite in a dualistic way as beyond the finite? Here, Pannenberg notes first of ali that one cannot think the infinite in a mathematical way as Schrankenlosigkeit. Rather God's infinity is the opposite to the finite as such. Infinite is a qualitative property of God, not a quantitative one. Further, Pannenberg relates the finite and the infinite in this way: the infinite is the negation of the finite but is so related to the finite that the infinite embraces within itself even the opposition between finite and infinite. For the relation between God and the world, this means that God lets the world be world, hence be autonomous, but God embraces the world within his own infinite life. God is distinct from the world but not separate from it. Among the significant properties which flow from God's infinity one could mention his eternity and his omnipotence. Since we have already seen that for Pannenberg, infinite and finite must be thought together, it follows that time and eternity must also be thought together. Thus Pannenberg rejects the Platonic tradition appropriated by St. Augustine according to which eternity means timelessness. In this conception eternity has no reference to time. Closer to the truth is Plotinus's idea that God's eternity signifies teillose Vollendung. God's eternity means that God embraces ali time within his own life, that God is related to every time. Pannenberg would not, however, deduce from this that God is an eternai present. Rather it would be more correct to view his relationship to the world as the in-breaking of his future into time. If, on the one hand, God does not become, on the other hand, his presence among us could be conceived as the coming of his future17. We have already seen that Pannenberg envisages God as acting in history. But as Infinite Being his action is radically different from human action. When the finite human being acts, he projects his future, a future which is stili outstanding, which is stili to be realized. Realizing his project, the finite person realizes himself and he does ali this out of need. But we cannot 17 In this, Pannenberg follows a line similar to that proposed by E. Jùngel in his book God as the Mystery of the World (Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark 1983), where Jiingel describes God's Being as in Corning.</page><page sequence="20">92 JOHN O'DONNELL. S.I. think of God as needy, nor can we think of God as setting a goal at the beginning of creation which he realizes only at the end. Rather, as we have seen ali along, we can only talk of God's essence from the point of view of the completion of his relationship with the world. We can only talk about his eternity on the basis of his fulfilled history. But from our point of view within history this eternity manifests itself as the in breaking of his future in the midst of our time. The approach which Pannenberg has taken to such attributes as God's omniscience and eternity prepares us to understand his doctrine of the divine omnipotence. Here Pannenberg wants to avoid at ali costs an anthropomorphic view of God which would lead to an interpretation of God as the cosmic tyrant. Since God's omnipotence is a mode of his infinity, the divine power cannot be understood in a finite way where the power of one being always poses a threat to the power of another. Rather, as we have seen throughout, God is die alles bestimmende Realitàt. In this context God's power is not a threat to finite beings, because God's power is the expression of the fact that God is the Creator. God is all-powerful in the sense that he lets ali beings be. God calls them into being and with his omnipotence preserves them from falling into nothingness. God is not a threat to finite beings. Rather as Creator, God affirms the creatures in their finitude. He lets them be what they are with the autonomy proper to them as creatures. In developing the doctrine of God's omnipotence in this way, Pannenberg has sought to understand this divine attribute in a way which does justice to the autonomy of man. From his earliest essays,18 the aspect of human autonomy has been particularly important especial ly in light of the atheistic critique. In Pannenberg's view, a God who knows ali things in advance of time or a God who fashions a pian for the world before time begins or a God who is thought of as perfect and complete in himself at every point of past or present is a God who in the end leads to atheism, for such a God renders the autonomy of man unthinkable. Since Pannenberg wants to be faithful to the God of the Bible and at the same time wants to think this God in a way which meets the challenge of atheism, he opts for the idea of a God who is real without being an existent being. God is not a pre-existing omniscient 18 See, for example, W. Pannenberg, "Anthropology and the Question of God," Basic Questions in Theology, Voi. 3 (London: SCM, 1973), pp. 80-98, especially p. 93; also "Speaking About God in the Face of Atheist Criticism," ibid., pp. 99-115, especially, pp. 109-110.</page><page sequence="21">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 93 omnipotent subject. Rather, God's essence is infinite, omniscient, eternai and omnipotent but we can speak of this essence only on the basis of his future which makes its appearance in our time, bringing with each appearance the promise that our finite being is called to commun ion with God's triune being in the coming Kingdom. Triune Love In Pannenberg's view the New Testament makes two major assertions as regards God's Being, both of which can be reduced to a unity. On the one hand, the fourth gospel affirms that "God is Spirit" (Jn 4, 24); on the other hand, the First Letter of John declares that "God is love" (1 Jn 4, 8. 16). In the first place, Pannenberg notes that love cannot be considered merely as one attribute among others. In its deepest sense love is not an attribute of God but rather describes God's Being as such. Ali the other attributes are expressions of the divine love and must find their unity in God's Being as love. In the second place, Pannenberg seeks to clarify the relationship between God's Being as Love and his Being as Spirit. We have already seen that Pannenberg interprets the meaning of Spirit as the divine dynamic field of life. Furthermore, this field exists in the interaction of the three persons. Thus Geist can be used to describe the divine field of life as well as the hypostatic person of the Holy Spirit. From the Father as infinite source of vitality proceeds the Spirit which is received by the Son as gift. This Spirit fills the Son who in turn hands back the Spirit to the Father. Thus the unity of the Godhead is the unity of Geist where Geist signifies the infinite vital force of the divine field as well as the interaction of the three persons. The divine life only exists in the community of persons where each person exists in ecstatic relationship with the other persons and at the same time in ecstatic relationship with the all-embracing field of the divine life. God is love insofar as God is Spirit and vice-versa. The unity of the Godhead is the unity of love and spirit. But can we clarify even further the unity of the divine attributes? We have already seen that Pannenberg appeals to Gregory of Nyssa's intuition that the foundation of the concepì of God is to be located in the divine Infinity. If this is the case, then the unity of the divine attributes must be thought in relation to God's Infinity. Finite beings must be thought of as unified but their unity is numerical and is capable of multiplication. A finite being is one among many. But as the Infinite, God's Being is not capable of multiplication. God's unity is not that of</page><page sequence="22">94 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. one among many. As Schleiermacher noted, this fact compels us to think of God's Being as Absolute. But the whole burden of Pannen berg's attempt to think God has been to think God in relation to the world. Hence, for Pannenberg, we cannot think the One apart from the world, nor can we reduce the One to the world. Rather we must think God as the One who embraces the Ali, at the same time distinguishing himself from the Ali. In other words, the challenge is to think the Infinite in relation to the finite. Pannenberg's approach is so to think the Infinite that the Infinite creates space for the finite without placing the finite outside of itself. The opposition between finite and infinite is, so to speak, sublated or aufgehoben within the Infinite itself. Hence, Pannenberg's doctrine of the divine essence is not that of a monadic unity but a unity which includes differentiation. For this reason he only treats of the divine unity after he has treated of the divine Trinity. In Pannenberg's opinion, without the doctrine of the Trinity we can think neither the unity of God's Being in itself nor the unity of God's Being with the world. God's unity is the unity of the love of the three divine persons. This unity comes to appearance (Erscheinung) in the action of the three divine persons in history. Hence, we must think the unity of the immanent Trinity in connection with the unity of the economie Trinity, but the ultimate unity of both will be established only in the eschaton when it will be both revealed and decided that God from ali eternity is one divine being in the unity of love of the three divine persons. Concluding Reflections Anyone reading Systematische Theologie I with a knowledge of Pannenberg's previous theological writings cannot help but be impres sed by the magnitude of his effort to address the major questions of a Gotteslehre and attempt an originai synthesis. Pannenberg's mastery of the philosophical tradition, his research into the phenomenology of religions, his acquaintance with the empirical sciences not to mention his familiarity with a wealth of exegetical studies make his synthesis a permanent contribution to the ongoing discussion of the Christian doctrine of God. Moreover, he is thoroughly consistent in the funda mental intuition which has guided his reflections during the past thirty years. This intuition is the historical nature of being. From his earliest essays to his present Dogmatik he has sought to understand the nature of revelation as history and he has tried to think God as the future of</page><page sequence="23">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 95 history. Obviously the major dialogue partner is Hegel and the tradition of German idealism. Pannenberg wishes to think God in union with history without falling into the trap of the becoming God of either Hegel or Whitehead. Nevertheless, this fundamental guiding principle is at the sanie time the decisive factor which creates the major tensions in Pannen berg's system and brings it to the verge of collapse. Let me illustrate my point by referring to four neuralgic areas of Pannenberg's treatise. The first is the relationship between time and eternity. For Pannenberg, eternity does not stand beyond time nor does God stand at the beginning of history. As we have seen throughout, we can only speak of God from the point of view of the end from which his future breaks into time. But it is also noteworthy that one of the motives for which Pannenberg develops this position is to overcome the all-knowing God whose omniscience and omnipotence pose a threat to human autonomy and so lead to atheism. But does the classical idea of God's eternity necessarily lead to these consequences? As Norris Clarke has pointed out,19 many of the process positions are based on the rejection of a 'foreknowledge' in God where everything which happens in history is pre-known and pre-loved independently of the actual course of created history thus endangering true contingency and freedom. But Clarke goes on to insist that such an interpretation of the classical doctrine of God's eternity is based on a serious misunderstanding. In the strici sense, we cannot speak of any foreknowledge in God. God does not know things before they happen. What we must say is that whatever happens is contemporary to God. God's knowledge is not spread out into a before and after. Pannenberg seems to admit as much in his doctrine of divine omniscience where he explains the doctrine as meaning that nothing escapes God in ali creation (see S.T. 1, p. 411). The same problem of the eternai and the temporal underlies Pannenberg's treatment of the relation of the immanent and the economie Trinity. We have seen that Pannenberg tries to avoid the Scylla and Charybdis of a becoming God à la Hegel and an eternai immutable God à la St. Thomas. Clearly he specifically rejects an Hegelian version of a God who becomes triune by relating himself to history (see S.T. 1, p. 359), but at the same time in making the Father 19 See W. Norris Clarke, S.J., "A New Look at the Immutability of God," in Robert J. Roth, S.J. (ed.), God Knowable and Unknowable (New York: Fordham University Press, 1973), pp. 63-64.</page><page sequence="24">96 JOHN O'DONNELL, S I. dependent on the Son to the point that the Fathers's divinity is at stake until the Kingdom is established (see S.T. 1, p. 357), Pannenberg seems to come dangerously dose to process theology with its finite God.20 Is not the root of Pannenberg's difficulty here his fundamental assumption that we can only talk about God's essence on the basis of the fulfillment of his history with the world? A related difficulty occurs in regard to Pannenberg's doctrine of the trinitarian persons. It is well known that process philosophy embraces the doctrine that to be is to be in relation. At the same time, we know that Christian theology as far back as the Cappadocians defined the trinitarian persons in terms of their relations. But the Fathers of the Church did so in terms of relations of origin. Pannenberg rejects this teaching for the more contemporary doctrine of mutually dependent relations. But I would argue that although there is reciprocity among the persons of the Trinity, there is also a sense in which some relationships are unilateral. I do not see, for example, how one can lay aside the fact that in the Trinity everything proceeds from the Father, so that, for example, the Son receives his hypostasis from the Father and not vice versa. Neither the scriptures nor the tradition warrant an unrestricted mutuality of relationships in the Trinity. Once again, Pannenberg's tendency to link the eternai to the temporal, and his proclivity to make the immanent Trinity dependent on the economie, play him false. Finally, the relationship between time and eternity determines Pannenberg's view of truth. We have seen that Pannenberg embraces a coherence theory of truth interpreted in a temporal way. Only in the eschaton can we say definitively what is true. It is for this reason that not only the propositions of theology but also the truths of revelation become provisional. Not only are they revisable but they are also in principle falsifiable. Although such an approach might favour the contemporary understanding of theology as a science and so win it a hearing from a secular audience, it undermines the basic certitude of the Christian community which claims to know God's Lordship here and now in the risen Christ.21 Once again, what is at stake is the relationship 20 Pannenberg writes, for example, "Die eschatologische Vollendung wird damit nur zum Ort der Entscheidung dariiber, dass der trinitarische Gott immer schon, von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit, der wahre Gott ist." S.T. 1, p. 359. 21 Jtingel makes a similar objection against Pannenberg in this context, when he asks how a dogmatic statement can be at one and the same time an hypothesis (and thus</page><page sequence="25">PANNENBERG'S DOCTRINE OF GOD 97 between time and eternity and the meaning of the Christ-event as the eschatological event. Pannenberg rejects an immutable God for the God who is future, whose divinity will only be unmistakably established in the future. But without falling into the immutable God of Aristotle, is it not possible to conceive of an eternally trinitarian community of love which is so infinitely open as to create space for the world where God has time for us? In this case, the eternai God could reveal himself here and now in an unsurpassable event whose name is Jesus Christ. In this case, God's Lordship would not just be future but also present. And Christ's living presence in the church would be the guarantee of the church's certitude to stand in the truth not only in the eschaton but also 'between the times.'

Pannenberg sur Dieu telle qu'il la propose dans Systematische Theologie I, mais en la placant dans le contexte des oeuvres précédentes. Pannenber y développe de fagon constante une doctrine eschatologique de Dieu selon laquelle l'essence divine est consti tuée seulement à la fin de l'histoire. La dogmatique n'a pas pour tàche d'élucider les mystères de la foi mais d'en établir la véracité. Comme la vérité ne sera établie qu'à la fin des temps, toute dogmatique reste partielle et fragmentaire; une doctrine définitive sur Dieu est impossible. La dogmatique tend plutót à rendre valide la foi au Dieu chrétien qui doit justifier son droit à étre appelé Dieu face aux prétentions des dieux des autres religions et spécialement au défi de l'athéisme. La project de Pannenberg est fortement apologétique. Il cherche à démon trer sur base anthropologique que toute personne doit forcément poser la question de Dieu. Selon lui la théologie ne sera en état de répondre de fajon adéquate à la critique de la religion de Feuerbach que si cette prémisse est d'abord établie. Cepedant Dieu ne peut ètre connu que là où il se fait connaitre. La réflexion philosophique doit donc céder le pas à l'expérience concrète de Dieu qu'offrent les religions. Un trait intéressant de la méthode mise en oeuvre par Pannenberg dans son traité consiste en la relation entre la Trinité divine et l'unité divine. Selon lui, on ne peut aborder la question de l'unité qu'après avoir tenu compte de l'histoire des trois personnes. Pannenberg développe ici la doctrine trinitaire plus largement qu'il ne l'avait fait dans les oeuvres précédentes. Il comprend les personnes trinitaires comme relations réciproques, non seulement comme relations d'origine. Pour Pannenberg l'attribut centrai de l'ètre divin est son Infinité. Mais comment penser la relation entre l'infini et le fini sans mettre l'infini en dehors du fini et sans abolir la véritable autonomie du fini? Selon Pannenberg Dieu comme Infini est en relation avec le fini de telle sorte que l'opposition entre l'infini et le fini est contenue dans sa vie propre. Dieu est distinct du monde mais il n'en est pas séparé. La conclusion de l'article formule un certain nombre de questions. Une doctrine selon laquelle l'essence divine est constituée seulement à la fin des temps rend-elle compte de la réalité présente de Dieu? Pannenberg craint d'affirmer un Dieu connaissant tout d'avance et qui établit au commencement un pian qui se réalisera à travers le temps; pareille crainte ne repose-t-elle pas sur une fausse compréhension de la doctrine classique de l'éternité divine? Pannenberg tient-il compte suffisamment de la Seigneurie actuelle du Christ? Une dogmatique qui énonce des hypothèses à vérifier correspond-elle au caractère affirmatif de la foi chrétienne?</page></plain_text>
