THE discussion which is nlow brought to a close has well served its purpose of thoroughly ventilating the questions raised in this journal in December, 1917; and it is superfluous, as it would be wearisome, to add any further arguments to those which have already been employed. There are however two points which seem to call for remark, both conicerned with misunder- standings of the original memorandum. The first has formed the foundation of more than one criticism, and though these criticisms have already been countered, it is desirable that no trace of miisunderstanding should be left in the minds of readers. The words " morphology " and " morphological " were used, not with reference to the study of external and internal structute as such, but as indicating the study of these with a view to elucidating phylogeny, whether of organs or' of organisms. This is so clear ly apparent in the original memorandum as to make it a little curious that anyone should have been misled. The close study of structuLre is an essential element in the work of the student of biology and affords an unsurpassed training in accuracy of observation. That is common ground, and it is doubtful if any teacher of biology would wish materially to lessen the amount of time devoted to the study of structure. What was urged is a change in the miiain centre of interest of elementary teaching-a change from interest in lines of descent 'to interest in the plant in all its manifold aspects as a living organism. As Professor V. H. Blackman aptly expresses the idea: "' The main problem to be presented to the student seems to them [the signatories of the original memorandum] to be that of living, not that of origin." The study of structure is most certainly essential: the question is the point of view from which it should be unidertaken, and, as a corollary, which str uctures should have most attention paid to them. Secondly it has come to the editor's knowledge that a certain remark in the memorandum: " Side by side with this [the teaching of facts of structure and their interpreta. tioni from the phylogenetic standpoint] there generally goes a</page><page sequence="2">Reconstruction of Elementary Botanical Teaching. 109 discussion of function which is often limited by a crude Darwinian teleology," has aroused some resenitment; though this has not found overt expression in any contribution to the discussion. It is certainly strange that such a remark should be thought to imply any slight upon Darwin's work. It is clearly the misuse of the theory of natural selection by teachers which is aimed at. And that misuse, unhappily still prevalent, is not a new discovery on the part of the signatories of the memorandum, but has long been evident to all who are interested in the current teaching of biology. The criticism was put tersely and vigorously by Professor Farmer, for instance, in his Presidential Address to Section K of the British Association at Leicester in 1907. "Many people still find consolation and satisfaction in an anthropomorphic and somewhat slipshod ap- plication of a kind of doctrine of free-will to matters that really call for rigorous examination into the causes which, tinder given conditions must inevitably and of necessity bring about their definite result." " It is not enough to explain the appearance of a structure on the ground of its utility; properly speaking, such attempts, so far from providing any explanation, actually tend to bar the way of inquiry just where scientific investigation ought to commence." It is obvious that this barrier to enqulily is falsely justified in the minds of those who erect it by the doctrine of natural selection, which professes to give a causal explanation of the origin of useful structures and reactions on the ground of their usefulness. In very many cases no attempt is made to analyse for students the abso- lutely fundamental matter of the relation of the doctrine of natural selection to physico-chemical causation of structure and process,with the result that too many students are allowed to slip into the habit of looking at living things in the anthropomorphic and slipshod way of which Professor Parmer complained. Of the widespread preval. ence of this vicious habit of mind answers to examination questions give abundant evidence. That is what was meant by " a crude Darwinian teleology," and it is certainly not Darwin's fault that his teaching has been so much abused. It seems hardly necessary to say that one of the objects of all teachers of biology should be to free their students' minds from the anthropomorphic bias which is present in every untutored human mind; but unhappily the evidence is conclusive that this is not successfully done. It is indeed an irony that Darwin, who freed the world from the narrow teleology of the doctrine of the special creation of useful struc- tures for useful ends, should be used as cover for a new teleology</page><page sequence="3">110 Postscript. almost as narrow, annd much less logical. It is true that the best and most vigorous-minded studenits avoid or emanicipate themselves from this slipshod habit, but ill dealing witli general questions, such as the method and content of elementary teachiing, it is the mass of students that has to be considered. Similarly in regard to the general nature of the elementary couirses that are at present given. Some of these are no doubt framedi on thoroughly enilightenedt lines, andl there has certainly been a developmenit in the direction of patying more attention to the more vital aned funidamenital parts of the subject. No one has contendied that the subject is diead or even moribund, and development of the kind must take place in any living department of knowledge. What prompted the original memorandum was the conviction that elementai-y teaching in general requires to be brought more consciously and rapidly into accord with the newer developments, if serious dangers are to he avoided and the subject is to dlischarge its duty to the community. The suggestioni that the syllabus of an elementary course, on the lines indicated in the memortandum, should be dr-awn up and published has been made from several quarters. In accordance with this suggestioni a meeting of botanists known to be in sympathy with the ideas of the memor andlum was held in Lontidon in January, and a small committee was appointed to compile such a syllabus. The demanid that concrete form should he given to the ideas expressed could not be r efused, but the task of the committee is not easy if the right combination of deflniteness and elasticity is to he attained and the impressioni that the authors desire to dictate to their fellow botanists to be avoided. Alreadly deprecation of a "1 cast-iron " or "1 stereotyped " course has been expressed. Is it necessary to say that nothing of the ktind is intended or desired ? But an effort will be made to give detailed for m and structure to the ideas expressed, and thus to help towvards the realisation of the widespread desire for elemenitary courses which shall more nearly meet the needs of the present time than those framed on the older models. Substantial help in the way of results of experience with elementary classes has already been obtained, and further co- operation from a11 wivo are willing to give the benefit of their knowvledge and experience is invited.</page></plain_text>
