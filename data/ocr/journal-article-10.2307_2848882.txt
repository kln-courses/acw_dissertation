IN this book Jurgis Baltrusaitis is chiefly aiming to establish the exotic origins of an heterogeneous group of fantastic, teratological, and supernatural themes found in Gothic art. One must note that the choice of examples showing an exotic derivation is neither strictly limited to what is traditionally recognized as the Gothic period (the author includes a number of examples from the sixteenth century) nor exclusively confined to the "domaine surnaturel" and the "irrealisme fantastique" to which the author dedicates the book in his introduction (there are chapters</page><page sequence="2">78 Reviews devoted to ornamental styles, costume, and architectural morphology). The exotic sources discussed in this work are related to a great variety of phases of art history, involving Islam, Persia, India, China, Japan and - surprisingly enough - the Graeco-Roman world. Thus the term "exotic" must be under- stood as referring to what was considered exotic - that is pagan, outlandish, remote - in the Gothic period. The best equivalent for "exotic" would be "Saracenic," for the reader is told (pp. 8-9) that both Classical and Oriental arts were frequently confused under this designation during the mediaeval era. The search for exotic derivations is traditionally associated with the study of the early stages of mediaeval art. Nevertheless, the concept of the exotic sources of Gothic art is probably as old as the very idea of the Gothic period understood as representing a distinct artistic phase of the past. The existence of such sources was already fairly often accepted in the eighteenth century (for instance, by Fenelon, quoted in Marsy's Dictionnaire de peinture et d'architecture [1746], i, 282, and by Lenoir, in his Muse'e des monuments frangais, An VIII, i, 13). Later, as is well known, this idea was repeatedly explored by some of the greatest scholars of the nineteenth century, such as De Longperier and Courajod. How- ever, they found it necessary to fight the chauvinism of the school which pre- tended - to paraphrase one of Courajod's lectures at the Ecole du Louvre (10 June, 1891) - to confine the investigation of the origins of Gothic art within the borders of France, and to force the savants to look for the sources of Notre- Dame of Paris in the Maison Carree of Nimes. The attitude castigated by Courajod has not yet completely disappeared. But today, living in the midst of an immense musee imaginaire, after a number of important studies by scholars like G. Soulier, C. Sterling, and G. Marcais, we are well prepared to welcome a book such as Le Moyen Age fantastique. This book undoubtedly represents one of the most extensive, most stimulating, and also one of the most "radical" expressions of the exotic thesis. (In the last of these qualities one may be reminded of some of the ideas of Josef Strzygowski.) Jurgis Baltrusaitis presents us with an almost kaleidoscopic succession of highly complex problems. Le Moyen Age fantastique begins with a discussion of Graeco-Roman and Gothic grylli, and ends with an investigation of the Eastern origins of the ogee arch. In the course of this book the reader is challenged by problems such as the use of Kufic characters in mediaeval decorative art, the Chinese origin of the bat wings of the Gothic demonological tradition, the corre- spondence of Western and Oriental anthropomorphic and zoomorphic landscapes, the occurrence of Chinese conventionalized clouds in the decoration of Gothic manuscripts, the relation between the temptation of Buddha and the temptation of St Anthony, the Thibetan sources of the late mediaeval macabre themes, etc. The very number and the highly specialized nature of these questions pre- cluded a study en profondeur which would have allowed the author to develop his subject in closer relation to the literary and the philosophical background of the period. For instance, since fantastic and bizarre themes are given such a preponderant role in the book, it would have been most interesting to investigate their meaning in connection with the evolution of the concept of imagination</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 79 (which was so effectively analyzed in M. W. Bundy's The Theory of Imagination in Classical and Mediaeval Thought). Naturally, one cannot criticize the inten- tionally limited scope of Le Moyen Age fantastique, for the reader is told by the author that it represents only a part of a far more extensive, hitherto unpublished study: Re&amp;veils et Prodiges dans l'art gothique. As it is, with its massive accumulation of facts and ideas, the book is an im- posing scholarly achievement. One must note that, in spite of this erudition, its findings are essentially based on illustrations in which are juxtaposed examples of Gothic and exotic art. A particularly striking instance can be seen in a con- frontation (p. 45) of a detail from Bosch's Temptation of St Anthony in Lisbon, a creature composed solely of a human head and two legs, with a similar mon- ster which appears on the seal of Raoul Aubry (Gothic forgery of an antique intaglio). Among the most thought-provoking visual comparisons of the book, one may also mention one of the several confrontations of Chinese and Gothic ogee arches (p. 276) and the juxtaposition of a danse macabre depicted in a wood- cut by Wolgemut with that which appears in an unidentified Thibetan painting (p. 9247). Jurgis Baltrusaitis opens the door to a world of fascinating conjectures. How- ever, such juxtapositions involve some danger. When two images, originating from widely distant sources (chronologically as well as geographically), present a sufficient degree of similarity, one is often prone - even without any decisive documentary evidence at hand - to accept hastily the earliest instance as the obvious source of the later one. The reader of Le Moyen Age fantastique must face this danger a number of times. An extreme case can be found in a confronta- tion of a tenth-century banner from Tun-huang (Musee Guimet) with a detail (p. 9218) of Dirk Bouts' Hell (Louvre). In both pictures, one can see a man falling from a craggy, vaguely anthropomorphic cliff (the text claims the latter quality for Bouts, but not for the Chinese painting), and the author notes that in both cases the victim is shown head down and is placed at the same point of the com- position. Since the author abstains from an evaluating comment, the reader seems to be implicitly invited to accept these rather superficial similarities as a decisive proof of a Chinese influence in the work of the Flemish artist. Whatever its other merits - unusually well written text, small but excellent illustrations - or shortcomings - no index, one major misprint (pp. 93-95) the book succeeds in significantly qualifying our understanding of the sources of Gothic art. It extends their ramifications, casts a revealing light on some of their least studied elements, and provides a mine of comparative material which will undoubtedly play a very important role in further studies devoted to the subject.
