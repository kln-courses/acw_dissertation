There are images and signs. There are works. These could be the last sentences of a talk. They could also be the only ones. In the following I will briefly sail between two or three couples of Scylla and Charybdis that could take the name of painting and history, image and memory, or body and sign. First of all, let me affirm that, without doubt, as a painter, a European painter living in the 20th century, I am a Greek. I am Greek, Latin, and also German. This is the problem: the legacy, the images, the transmission. "We cannot think without images," says Aristotle in his On Memory and Recollection, and again: "Memory, even the memory of concepts, cannot exist apart from imagery." Memory for the past, he suggests, perception for the present, hope for the future. None of the first terms of these pairs of words is independent of the other. They are, in their inadequateness, almost interchangeable. Or, at least, they live together, as in Augustine's "I want to sing a song that 1 know already." The object of memory is the absent one, what no longer shares space with us, what is just an image. Memory is indeed the slave of the image; recollection, on the contrary, is precisely the activity of going behind images, of eliminat- ing our dependence on them. Anamnesis, coming after and behind Mneme, sets together, in new orders, within "a sort of syllogistic process," parts of the maiterial that the latter is, merely doomed to preserve. There is, indeed, the requirement of preserving and filing and the imperative of attacking and questioning the inherited images. To accept the legacy and to let it fade away, leaving us scattered pieces of knowledge and consciousness. It is clear, then, that the advent of Anamnesis requires a certain gap in time, a caesura or even obscurity: remembrance cannot happen without forgetfulness and even without some unfaithfulness to one's owh past; there is neither openness nor hope without betrayal. Even betrayal of the most beloved one, the absent one, the mere image. II Behind the picture is an absent body; behind the vision is the indistinguishable. In a 1932 article published in the French Revue de philologie, Emile Benveniste quotes the sacred laws of Cyrene: "A suppliant stranger. If he has been sent into a home, if the master of the home knows who has sent him to him, he will at first call the sender, by name, for three days. But if this one is dead in the region or has perished elsewhere ... he will make two kolossoi [statues], one male, the other female, of wood or of earth, and he will offer to them, in his home, a part of everything. The rite being accomplished, he will bring the kolossoi and the offerings into a wild forest, to fix them there."1 15.55 Salvatore Puglia, detail from Über die* Srhadťlnmen, 1 99 S.

The absent one is evoked by his name; if it is unknown, the statue takes the place of the name, of what calls - of what gives him his existence. The kolossos is a double; it takes the place and continues the existence of the one who has disappeared. It literally represents, presents again, the absent one, either dead or distant. Benveniste eventually suggests a Near Eastern etymology that associates kolossos with an "erected object/' a "standing image." This thing, then, the statue or the stele, is meant to establish a relation between this world and the beyond, between a self and otherness. This thing-double is in our time flat and light. It is called photography. Thirty years after Benveniste, Jean-Pierre Vernant struggles with this word kolossos, noting that "the Greeks have a visible form to certain powers of the beyond belonging to the sphere of the invisible."2 Either buried in an empty tomb, in place of an absent corpse, or stuck into the ground in some desert spot, the kolossos was not meant to be an image (in the sense of "reproduction"): "What is embodied in permanent form in stone is not the image of the dead man but his life in the beyond, the life that is opposed to that of living men as the world of night is opposed to the world of light." The camera obscura is our metaphorical tomb - the photograph will survive us, as the gravestones or the steles survive the bodies they recall. Photographs, then, are more than pictures. As doubles, they rep- resent. They present, again and again. They present us to others, others present them to us, they are the other's presents. More than images, they are calls. They recall, as Anamnesis does. Ill Roughly stated, the most evident analogy between photography and memory is that both are originally mere reproduction machines; both are "receptive surfaces" where some kinds of excitations remain, "for an unlimited time," impressed, as a stick on a wax tablet or sheet of malleable lead, as in the tabulae defixiomim (lead rolls etched with magic words and transfixed with bronze nails before being thrown in the tombs, used in ancient Greece and Rome to cast spells against one's enemies). We must linger for a moment on this notion of written images, in this strait between grammata and phantasia. In another essay Vernant returns to the presence of the invisible in ancient Greek representa- tional systems. In particular, he stresses that "during the so-called Dark Ages, that is, broadly speaking, from the twelfth to the eighth centuries before our era, Greece, which as you know has no knowledge of writing, also has no knowledge of imagery in the proper sense of the term, nor does it use systems of figurai representation. The same word, graphein, it should be noted, is used for writing, drawing, and painting."3 Only later, and under the influence of the East, will the Greeks start to organize the anthropomorphic canons of plastic art and fix the written records of history and thought. But, for now, let's cast a relation between this primitive sense of the word graphein - one that wel- comes and comprehends "writing, drawing, and painting" - and the gestures of a hand that traces signs, indicating the coexistence of a different means of expression. We know that reproduced images and written words belong to irreducibly distinct systems of language and could never have been read together - they can only be juxtaposed or superimposed. There will always be, between them, a lapse, providential and fertile, in space and in time. It is interesting to respect this distance without looking for fusion, to literal images or imagistic letters. I would like to imagine this lapse as a sort of petit mal, what the dictionaries define as "a brief blackout of consciousness without tonic or clonic movements," a caesura. One could imagine piercing visible space with the needles of time and language (the contrary of what the photograph does to history: piercing, frag- menting time with space).

Stone, soil, pigments. 1 X 7 m installation But we can establish bridges, relations. We can exploit repetition itself (repetition that, as Aristotle says, "generates a nature"). I will take what I need from a text in order to offer a model of work: in an early treatise on aphasia (1891), Freud points out a few relations between words and things; it is, once again, a story of reproduc- tion. "We learn to spell/' he says, "by linking the visual images of the letters with new sound-images, which, for their part, must remind us of verbal sounds which we already know. We at once 'repeat' the sound-image that denotes the letter/'4 and so on. IV Our vision of History, if not its very nature, has changed. The writing of History has, consequently, and in parallel, also changed. The grammata is now no more than a fraction of the photogrammata. "History," it has been said, "happens with photography."5 And the photograph, more than the trace of history, is, to this day, a sort of double (psyche?) of history itself. If I can extend my previous metaphor, the absent one represented by the kolossos is nothing but "our" History. What we hang on the walls and exhibit, then, is nothing but hung and exhibited history. It is possible to hang history on walls because it is no longer "ours" - it is no longer, to quote Jean-Luc Nancy, "the gener- al program of a certain Humanity, a Subject, a Progress."6 What remains is a heritage with no senders, or anonymous ones, a "suppliant stranger" who knocks insistently and noisily at our door. What remains is a mass of noisy material, a saturated, excessive, and obsessive memory. We cannot deny that, in the words of Gianni Vattimo, "This condition characterized by an excess of history, by the difficulty, even the impos- sibility, of forgetfulness, has become, in a very large sense, also ours."7 Every art that is meant to represent only itself, or even only itself within some tradition, is an expres- sion of kitsch. Every self-recognized or self-affirming art form, every form of art that forgets for a moment the uncanny character of our present, is an art of forgetting, the offspring of Amnesia. There is, I believe, even for those who work with, through, and behind the picture, an "anamnestic and anesthetic responsibili- ty," which is neither the flat exaltation of memory nor the pathos surrounding historical horror. This responsibility begins with the saturation of the image, with the contaminated field where the distinction between apology and denegration, commemoration and refusal, is neither clear nor determined. What remains is to collect and recollect the blurred noises around us, the sounds of what has disappeared, and represent them. What remains is to collect the floating fragments of this history, to dig bones, documents, and to signal, to transmit them. What remains is the possibil ty of a gesture: to hold out, in the scattered testimony to which we are doomed, some vestige, some expressions of a multiple Anamnesis. t/i "C Oh OO c '&gt; H (A M I- cc &lt; z &lt; (/&gt; M &lt; -J ta s a. ti i oc o H &lt; S &lt; (/) Salvatore Puglia, Vfanitas, 1993.
