<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASPECTS OF CAUSE IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY* Edward T. Price Some years ago the Social Sciences Division of Los Angeles State College instituted an extra-departmental course entitled "Scientific Method and Ap plied Logic" to inquire into the ways of gaining and establishing knowledge in the various social sciences. Discussions of the content, focus, method, and instructors for this course occasion showers of sparks that are illuminating and sometimes revealing. One proposal to meet some of the difficulties was that an instructor from each of the social sciences present a section of the course on the logic and methods of his own field. The plan did not mate rialize, nor has a geographer yet undertaken to teach the course, but I have frequently pondered the proper nature of geography's contribution in the framework of such a course. The methodological literature of American geography would not provide the instructor with many completed chapters as background for his presenta tion. We are far from working out these matters for ourselves. Our energy has been directed more to what geography is and how to do it than to its logic and epistemology. This is not to criticize our methods, but only to note that they could be further meshed with (not copied from) those in use in other fields. The materials in mind would cover the methods of the working geographer as well as the broader assumptions and conclusions accepted or in controversy among geographers. Some topics to be probed further are field study and observation, maps as portrayals of reality and tools of logic, problems of ob servational (non-experimental) induction, the theory of studying the unique and whether that is what we do, quantitative and qualitative representations of order on the earth. The region has been thoroughly dissected and de fended, but I am not sure that the basis of its use and existence has been put in the general framework of logic. Geographers study distributions, and many so define their field. When methods of analysing distributions are discussed, explanation is usually sought through correlation or correspondence with other distributions. Yet many geographers actually use distributions in a différent way, conceiving them as dynamic, changing forms, and explaining their status and behavior on the basis of a variety of conditions and events. I think that botanists and anthropologists have shown more interest in generic types of distribution patterns than geographers. Interpretation of distributions is so dependent on the behavior of the particular thing distributed that geographers, who don't limit themselves as to subject, may have shied away from generalization. Geographer and Environment The geographer, however, could probably make his most instructive con tribution to an understanding of the social sciences by analysing his own * Presidential address at the annual banquet of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers.

This is the question that has seemed most basic in geographic philosophy; it is the one whose logic offers the broadest play. Montefiore and Williams1 point out that the question of the environment in cause and explanation is too broad a philosophical matter to have a specifically geographic solution, hence argue that it has no practical implications for the working geographer. The point seems doubtful, but even more if it should be inverted. The working geographer peculiarly and constantly deals with data that bear on the broader question. He can hardly claim to exploit his domain unless he follows through on their implications. The environment is on our consciences. Witness the revival of interest in its meaning in spite of various stratagems to close the question. Lewthwaite,2 Spate,3 and Wright4 have recently denied that environmentalism itself is to be compared with a bogey, a dodo, or cock-robin.5 Rostlund6 and Lewthwaite7 have both recommended that we abandon fast conclusions and renew the search for the truth. The latter spoke of the need to examine the evidence in each particular case before reaching conclusions for that case. Rostlund's attention was on possible revision of the general conclusions about envi ronmentalism. He suggested that refined methods might be needed to catch the nuances of environmental effect on man. Though he did not specify the types of effect that might emerge, he may have been thinking of influences on the mind for whose apprehension the techniques of psychology would be the proper medium. Geography too could become a behavioral science. We may be at the point where, with the social sciences, we must look to psychology as keeper of our causal keys in the same way that all the natural sciences become more and more branches of physics. This speculation on the road ahead, however, cannot bear on what we can now determine. Cause and Effect My aim tonight is to identify some of the causes and effects with which we deal, to sort them over in the light of their relationships, and to examine the place of the environment among causes as occasion offers. The word environment will denote only the natural environment. Cause will denote a necessary8 or contributing antecedent of an effect, necessary or contributing in the sense that we can believe from experience that the effect would have 1 A. C. Montefiore and W.

Geographers, I find, are expert at juggling the frame of reference in an effort to deal with cause. I have found it a useful and necessary device in preparation of this paper. I shall introduce examples to explore the sorts of questions asked and the sorts of answers accepted in typical geographic problems. Some of you, during the past three days, may have had specific occasion to ask a geographic question: What on earth is this college doing on this site? The function and location seem most simply and harmoniously ex plained by reference to the educational program of California, the potential students in central Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, and presence of the nearby freeways coupled with the place of the automobile in Los Angeles. However, matters may not be so simple as they seem in a system where causes and effects are mediated by the mysterious logic of a black box suggestively labeled Sacramento, with power of decision beyond ques tion by mere laymen. The actual history of the College reveals: its origin as an outgrowth of Los Angeles City College with no relation to the present location, like a Spanish pueblo in having identity independent of any particular site or structures; selection of the site from among possibilities in many parts of the city for the ostensible reason that the State already owned it as a borrow pit for highway materials—the real truth of our location near the freeways.9 The vacancy of the site up to that time lay in some probabilistic relation to the steep hills that used to be here—some other hills around were built up—but also must be explained by plans of previous owners of the land. Another geographic question was posed in Housman s fine, "Or why was Burton built on Trent?"10 Out of its context the question is ambiguous. Each of the accents after why points to a possible emphasis, and the respec tive answers are all directly or indirectly useful to the geographer who would understand Burton. Perhaps, as Housman intended, the key word is Burton. Why Burton? The rhetorically implied answer is obviously the city's breweries, or more poetically apt, their ultimate purpose. The question could be stretched to inquire as to why the town was named Burton, presumably for location near a burgh or castle on that site or some earlier site. If the key word is built, the question could be answered with the reason for the town's original founding—possibly the castle mentioned before or a monastery of the ninth century. Finally, the key word could be Trent. Why location on this river? Stamp and Beaver11 provided a concise and environmentally satisfying answer in 1933 when they explained that the Trent had picked up from Carboniferous limestones upstream enough cal cium sulfate to impart the proper flavor to Burton's famous product. But their correction in a later edition12 said that the breweries obtained their water from wells in the Triassic marls, leaving us to seek more traditional reasons for a site specifically on the river. In both editions they say that the breweries are "no doubt largely a result of" the hard water. Among 9 Hubert S.

The third example, the American Corn Belt, is so familiar that only the general groups of causes will be mentioned: the nature of its climate and soils; the sources of its crop-livestock farming systems;13 some of the unique qualities of corn; the market for its products; the processes by which it acquired identity, recently explored by Spencer and Horvath.14 The three examples—a college, an old manufacturing city, and an agricul tural region—have deliberately been rather different. In each case I have aimed at explaining distinctive features of an area's occupance, to use a term that covers the totality of the human development in reference to, but not including, the environment. Selection of a set of discrete causes may be done in an infinite number of ways; the attempt has been to select a short list that are "strategic"15 in their relevance to the problem and to the view of the observer. The selection includes the grouping of the causes and their remoteness from the result. For the latter I have mostly tried to stay within the context of the problem as stated by Emyrs Jones,16 the historical situation which first produces the cultural assessment of the environment. Classes of Causes The various causes in the three examples bear interesting parallel to the causes set forth by Aristotle17 and now considered obsolete in some respects. I do not argue that the correspondence is one-to-one, that it is the same for all geographic examples, or that my parallel follows Aristotle's intent. His causes were: (1) the efficient cause, the source of the action bringing about the result, the men involved in matters of human geography: the government of California, viewed broadly, for the College; the brewers and burghers of Burton; the farmers of the Corn Belt. (2) the formal cause, the form or shape of the result, paralleled in a geographic problem by an origin, model, or pattern copied in a new place or new context: the idea or model of a state college or more remotely that of a public school or simply that of a school; the devel opment of a city or the invention of brewing; such patterns for the Corn Belt as crop-livestock farming, family farms, and the particular crops and animals. 13 See Edward Higbee, American Agriculture, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1958, pp. 230-239. 14 J.

(4) The final cause, or purpose, to be identified with the functional advan tage of the occupance: education for the College; for Burton and the Corn Belt, either the intent to make a living or the uses of their distinctive products. Aristotle also talked about the means or instrument used in effecting the result as having causal value,18 broadly parallel perhaps to technology in typical geographic problems. These various causes seem to be causes in different ways, to serve different roles in the production of the result. But their classification depends on the point of view, and the subdivision of the causes belies any idea of simple classification. Differing peoples have conceived the efficient cause as either man or god, and the final cause accordingly depends on whose purpose is being carried out. If the environment is a material cause when man acts, the earth as "temporary nursery of the human species" must have been viewed as an instrument in Ritter's teleology. The earth can also be viewed as a tool for man's use. In a totalitarian state the social purpose rather than the individual purpose is justified as cause, and some men may themselves be come tools rather than efficient causes. The subdivision of one part of the environment reveals other problems of classification. The soil is a material cause in the simplest Aristotelian sense if it is used for making bricks. The sense is different if we regard it as a supply of chemicals for crops. As a medium for the development of plant roots, the soil, like the atmosphere for what is above the soil, environs in a more literal sense. Consider also the place of the soil in the causal sequence. It is near the end of the chain in its use for growing a crop each year. It appears earlier in the chain in the way it is judged before the crop is ever selected or planted. The placing may be different in the experience that is acquired from its use. But the soil, or even the whole environment, can be treated (at least in concept) as a single cause contributing to the whole effect. Measures of Causes Regardless of the classification of causes, the point of emphasis is still that causes are multiple. We conceive for any problem a group of causes sufficient for the effect defined. If the group of causes is just sufficient, then each cause is necessary. If each of the causes is necessary for the result, there seems to be no general basis for saying that one cause is more important than any other19 18 Metaphysics, Book V, Chapter 2 (1013b). 19 Ernest Nagel, "The Logic of Historical Analysis," in Herbert Feigl and May Brodbeck (eds.), Readings in the Philosophy of Science, Appleton-Century-Crofts, N.Y., 1953, pp. 688-700. 11</page><page sequence="6">in its responsibility for the specific condition. It is like determining the most important link in a chain or allocating costs of production among a group of joint products or determining whether grain farmers or bankers are more important in the present American economy. In the equation 2X6= 12, the 2 and the 6 may be considered the causes of the 12; which is more important—the 6 because it is larger or the 2 because it determines how many 6's? Or even in 1 + 3 + 8 = 12, the result 12 would be changed by a change in any of the three smaller numbers. There are other combinations of numbers that add up to 12, but this 12 is dependent on each of its three components. In the geographic examples given we lack a general basis for saying that the environment is more important than some other cause or that it is less important. The well water at Burton is necessary for explaining Burton as it exists. The rich land of the Corn Belt is essential for its existence; so are the discovery of corn's usefulness in a feeding economy, the building of railroads, and a variety of other conditions. Whether the 100 acres of land form a necessary part of the explanation of this college depends more evidently on how we chose to define the college. The more narrowly we specify what is to be explained, the more causes turn out to be necessary.20 If we specify that the thing to be explained must be exactly as it is in every detail, then most of the past events of the universe may be necessary to it. If the thing is more broadly defined, many causes will be found contributing, but not necessary. In the previous sum, 1 + 3 + 8 = 12, the smaller numbers were all necessary in explaining the 12. If we are interested only in the fact that the sum is more than 10, then the 3 and 8 are necessary in a way that the 1 is not. In spite of the difficulty of distinguishing among causes, such distinctions are commonly made, even among necessary causes. These distinctions stem from the nature of the problem defined and from the group of causes in relation to each other and to the thing explained. Some bases for distinc tions among causes explaining occupance will be examined.21 1. Necessary causes may be held more important than contributing causes that are not necessary. A politically acceptable location was necessary for this campus at the time of its selection, but location near a freeway (which happened) or convenient to public transportation (which did not happen) was not necessary. The quality of the well water may be necessary for explaining the presence of a brewing industry at Burton, whereas the navigabilty of the Trent is probably not necessary. The Corn Belt has sometimes been defined on the basis of a minimum corn production per square mile. If this is the only attribute of the Corn Belt we need explain, it may be possible to eliminate some of the causes previously considered necessary to it. Fairly fertile soil would still be necessary,22 but the commercial tie to the United States meat market might not be. 2. Some causes may be held more fundamental than others. They may be 20 Their necessity also depends on how the causes are defined. The broader the cause, the more likely it is to be necessary. 21 Several of the bases for distinction are analysed in Nagel, op. cit. The present distinctions are arranged roughly in order of increasing apparent attention to cases other than the one to be explained. They overlap considerably. 22 Even fertile soil is not a generic necessity for high production, which can be obtained alternatively by fertilization. 12</page><page sequence="7">more fundamental in such ways as (a) lying farther back along the causal chain, (b) offering a wider range of effects, not necessarily just in the problem at hand, (c) being less subject to change as the result of changes in other révélant causes. A statement of Huntington on explaining health and prog ress embraces all of these: "Climate stands first, not because it is the most important, but merely because it is the most fundamental. It is fundamental by reason of its vital influence upon the quantity and quality not only of man's food but of most of his other resources; it plays a large part in deter mining the distribution and virulence of the parasites which cause the majority of diseases; and through its effect upon human occupations, modes of fife, and habits, it is one of the main determinants of culture. On the other hand, neither food, disease, nor culture has any appreciable effect upon climate, although they may modify its influence. Moreover climate has a direct effect upon health."23 For partly similar reasons climate is widely held by geographers to be at least the most important measure of the environment. 3. Some causes may be held as more variable or more likely, as they vary, to produce variation in the result, or more capable of manipulation. The results seem more sensitive to these causes. In a particular framework they are thé causes that most need to be pinned down. Giving emphasis to these causes is something like the value acquired by something scarce or the distinction between the merely urgent and the really important. In the examples given earlier I did not mention the necessity of air or gravity or human beings as causes, because they are not important variables, but are normally assumed. A purely physical illustration is offered first. Climate is commonly ac cepted as a more important determinant than parent material of the nature of mature soils. Persistence is adduced as the quality of the climate that enables it finally to shape a variety of parent materials to its own pattern. Yet we must recognize that both the parent material and the climate are necessary causes of a mature soil. Owing partly to the choice of properties used in classifying soils, the roles of parent material and climate are distin guished by the fact that climates are more critically variable over the earth; the parent materials are mostly made of the same small group of elements. Geographers and historians frequently explore causes by speculating on the effects of hypothetical changes in past conditions. This analysis of near misses, successfully applied, can produce a sort of multi-dimensional causal graph in the vicinity of the particular problem. One could speculate on what would have happened in the Corn Belt if it had been settled entirely by Scotch-Irish, if it had been surrounded by a tariff wall, if it had not been glaciated so recently, or if the Gulf of Mexico had been partly filled with land. Some of the answers may be supplied by reference to parts of the Corn Belt itself or to similar areas in other parts of the world. It could probably be demonstrated that corn production in the Corn Belt varies more with rainfall than with ethnic origin of the farmers. Rainfall might be held a more important cause of corn production than cultural background. By contrast, in southern Brazil, where a corn-hog economy is also important, it might be concluded, in spite of a number of complicating conditions, that corn production was more sensitive to ethnic origins. Most probably the 23 Ellsworth Huntington, Civilization and Climate, Third Edition, Yale Uni versity Press, New Haven, 1924, p. 3. 13</page><page sequence="8">sensitivity of occupance to either culture or environment varies with both culture and environment. 4. A cause that occurs more frequently in conjunction with a result may be held more important than a cause occuring less frequently. The greater frequency may stem from either of two conditions: (a) the cause simply occurs more often; (b) the cause is more likely to be followed by the result (only slightly different from case 3). One might argue that glaciation or prairie vegetation was the more important cause of the Corn Belt in accord ance with which condition covered more of the Corn Belt or of similar areas elsewhere. A census of state colleges might suggest whether local transporta tion or a level site should be considered the more important locational cause for campuses that enjoy both. 5. A cause that spreads over the map in broad, simple patterns may be considered more important than one more intricately distributed. Such a cause fits the framework with which the geographer works. In the illustra tion of soil causation the broad areas of the climatic map are more convenient to think about and talk about than the fragmented parcels of surface lithol ogy. The geographer is "one-up" in an argument if he can establish his cause as setting a broad pattern and other causes merely as responsible for local deviation. Huntington had this advantage with climate: "The outstanding fact is not local departures from the cultural level that would be expected on the basis of climatic efficiency, but the broad geographical agreement between the patterns of civilization and climate."24 And one might suspect from the filing of the term macrogeography25 that a claim to this same advantage has been staked. 6. The questions asked by the geographer may seek explanation only of differences among areas, not of a particular occupance itself. Cogent ar guments have recently been presented to explain tbe cash-grain areas of the Corn Belt by the presence of especially flat land on stream divides.26 The flat land, if the arguments hold, will explain the difference from other Corn Belt areas, but it cannot be considered in any general sense as the cause of the cash-grain areas. Or suppose one seeks explanation of race horse breeding in the Kentucky Bluegrass, heavy cotton production in the Black Waxy Prairie, or potato production in Aroostook County. In each case the answer sought is supplied by reference to conditions of soil and surface. But it takes more than soil peculiarities to account for the nature of any of these regions. Simplifying somewhat, we can say that the soil is the strategic cause of the location where the horses or cotton or potatoes are produced. If one forgets that he has explained only where and not equally what, then he may take an unjustified environmentalist position. The soil is a cause of the unique land 24 Mainsprings of Civilization, John Wiley.

It may not greatly modify the total production of race horses, cotton, or potatoes, because the demand for them could be largely fulfilled elsewhere. Environmental measures are likely to loom important in explanation of area differences, because they do inhere in the particular area. Our frame of reference tends to give them a favored position. Nevertheless it is common place to find equally simple cultural explanations of area difference. The dairy community at Solvang, California, is a Danish island undistinguished naturally from many other parts of the California coast ranges.27 To explore questions of areal difference in another way we might imagine a series of correlation coefficients between a condition that varies areally and other variables believed to be independent causes of it. The correlation coefficients would be measures of relative causal importance, but only as causes of differences or variability and not as causes of the variable phenom enon being studied. Summary So far I have assumed a tight causal system in which occupance is the result of a group of independent causes. This is the world most of us are accustomed to think we live in and five with. Our general acceptance of cause formed the basis of Martin's article, "The Necessity for Determinism."28 The environment examined here as to cause has been the local environment insofar as was possible. To summarize tentative conclusions: In the typical cases where causes are found to be necessary, causes of occupance are both environmental and cultural, and we have no basis for assigning priority to either. In the special contexts where it is meaningful to single out some causes as more important, the critical causes may be either environmental or cultural. What is useful in one instance may be useless in another. I find no general basis for attributing causal priority to either environment or culture. Environmentalism and Cause Extended analysis of the prevailing causal philosophies in geography is be yond the scope of this paper. But two of them will be tentatively examined in the fight of the foregoing analysis. Probably all of the ways of distinguishing among causes have been employed by both American environmentalists and by the culturally oriented possibilists of later day. The extreme environmentalist recognizes only environmental causes, but most real environmentalists have been unable to hold such a position in the face of abundant contrary evidence. One way around is to ask questions about the environmental causes only. The titles of two of Ellen Churchill 27 The special nature of causes of spatial differences may likewise apply to temporal changes. 28 A. F. Martin, "The Necessity for Determinism," Institute of British Geog raphers Transactions and Papers, Vol. 17, 1951, pp. 1-11. Martin argues that, whether or not the universe is considered determinate, the student must act as if it is in order to have something to study. The point is nicely made, but, in accordance with what is said below, I consider this at least as valid: Even if we accept determinism as reality, we must in practice accept some chance since critical causes may be too microscopic to detect. 15</page><page sequence="10">Semple's books suggest that her main questions were the ones she answered. Taylor too defined geography in narrowed terms: "It is our special duty to study geology, structure, climate, soils, etc., and their effects on man. It is not our special duty to study all the ramifications of man's interest."29 Environmentalism flourished on the broad view. (Its decline coincided with the rise of intensive small-area studies.) Causes, freed of their rigidity, became "influences." The environmental cause was more likely to produce the result, especially if given enough time, and environmental causes were most likely to be found in association with the results. Deviation was recognized as common on the small scale—the minor influences at work. Huntington has already been quoted to that effect. "Nature determines the route of development," according to Taylor,30 man "the rate and the stage." Semple seems to reach the same place with her comparison of "typical peoples of all races and all stages of cultural development living under similar geographic conditions. ... A people may present only a partial re sponse to their environment because their arrival has been too recent."31 But the interplay of man and nature is presented in so many artfully different ways that they do not lend themselves to sharp characterization. All can be subsumed only under some such vague phrase as Semple's geographic view of history, "a succession of geographic factors embedded in events."32 Cultural Geography and Cause The most articulated viewpoint among American Geographers of the last generation has shifted the emphasis from environment to culture. In the rejection of environmentalism the environment has been subordinated to the choice of man. I think we have been saying that our ways of living vary more from place to place with culture than with the environment. The argument is put in various ways: (1) A priori: The mode of life represents the result of ideas conceived by man; the environment cannot explain it;33 (2) A priori and a posteriori: The active shaping of the occupance is car ried out by man;34 the environment is passive, providing the raw material and setting limits; 29 Griffith Taylor, Geography in the Twentieth Century, Philosophical Library, New York, 1951, p. 11. 30 Ibid, p. 15. 31 Ellen Churchill Semple, Influences of Geographic Environment, Henry Holt, New York, 1911, p. 27. 32 Ibid., p. 11. 33 Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape," University of California Publications in Geography, Vol. 2, No. 2, 1925, p. 47: "the human habitation and the landscape .. . are derived from the mind of man, not impressed by nature, and hence are cultural expressions." 34 Ibid., p. 46: "the shaping force of the cultural landscape, however, lies in the culture itself." John B.

Henri Berr, "Foreword" in Lucien Febvre, A Geographical Introduction to History, New York, 1925, p. xiii: "it is man who always plays the more initiative part." 16</page><page sequence="11">(3) A posteriori: "In a relatively stable environment, no example of posi tive determinism has been demonstrated by acceptable method."35 There are broad senses in which I agree with all three, find them useful, and put them into practice. They have encouraged the treatment of culture history as a continuous process, emphasizing, as Leighly put it, "the essential time-bond of culture rather than its looser place-bond."36 But I do not think the statements can be taken as ranking the causes, for there are senses in which they seem to beg that question. Of course the pattern of living is effected by man. The environment as a cause is often farther back along the causal chain.37 More or less consciously man can learn by trial and error to use or to avoid the environment; he can imitate nature in his art and artifices. More or less unconsciously man's mind and mood may be im pressed by nature in ways that affect his action. It is not that man has to do this or that, but that his choices often vary with the environment. The question is whether the effect is related to the environment, not how it comes about. However we classify the environment as cause, it is a necessary condition of the occupance, an independent parameter with which, among others, the occupance varies. The active man-static environment idea impinges confusingly on different concepts of cause. One early idea of cause was human action in purposely bringing something about. This idea was then transferred to inanimate causation (whence many environmentalists), but later abandoned as mis leading. "The notion of efficient cause survives in our ordinary language in such words as 'produce,' Tiring about,' 'make,' 'due to,' 'result of,' and 'consequence of' and in the host of more specialized causal verbs. When the 35 Preston James, "Introduction: The Field of Geography," American Geog raphy: Inventory and Prospect, Syracuse University Press, Syracuse, 1954, p. 13. The specification of a stable environment offers the methodic problem that changing environments might offer some of the best opportunities for measuring the effects of environment. SG Op. cit., p. 135. 37 The place of culture in the causal chain is at best complex and puzzling. Though man and culture are distinct concepts, they are identified in many dis cussions of geographic cause. True it is hard to separate a man from his culture. But culture conceived as a cause is an abstraction that may be no more capable of positive action than the environment. Square fields may be less positively determined by the culture than their rolling contours by the environment. Culture is partly like the environment in being expressible only through the minds of men. (A. L. Kroeber may have spoken in this same sense: "Culture can appear and go on only in and through men."

My doubts about weighing causes should not be taken to mean that the attempt to unravel them will be useless. There is much to learn about the manner in which the efficient cause (man) can use his evolving cultural abilities (themselves causes and effects) to evaluate and manipulate both natural and cultural causes, seeking recombinations to produce chosen results. Geography studies the meeting place of natural phenomena and social phenomena; in doing so it must cope with the meeting of two systems of thought: the rigid laws that natural phe nomena are supposed to follow and the subjectivity at least popularly accepted for social phenomena wherein the very holding of opinions may at times make them valid. 17</page><page sequence="12">subject of these verbs is an inanimate thing the anthropomorphic element is a mere linguistic survival and does not (for most people) express anything present in thought."38 I wonder if we have really discovered by observation that man is active whereas nature is static. We may have simply recognized that two differing concepts of cause are applied to them. The active-static distinction lacks meaning in implying any primacy of one type of cause over the other. Other Views of Cause Before closing this discussion it seems appropriate to take note of cause in a broader framework than has been considered. Long-term and long distance causal chains enter into the geographer's considerations, and en vironments may be involved in every link. The state of the universe may be conceived as determined by its state (physical and cultural) at any previous time and as determining the state at all future times.89 Such a determinism becomes in the long run environmental determinism, for we must trace the causal continuity back to times before there was man and before there was life. Discrete causes and effects discussed earlier are replaced by continua. Aschmann pointed out the importance of studying the effects of both local and remote environments: "Cultures differ in different localities, and the basic cause may be sought in the environment, broadly conceived so as to include the culture which itself has an origin, or in genetic human differ ences; and in no other places."40 Thus all matters of culture are brought back to the earth and to human genes. But genes too have sprung from the earth. "With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead, And there of the Last Harvest sowed the Seed."41 And I wonder about Aschmann's last phrase "and in no other places." At least in practicality might we not consider the matters of chance and inven tion in human progress? The paths of both biological and cultural evolution may diverge more sharply than the uniqueness of environments would indicate. Emrys Jones42 has discussed chance in the natural and social realms, comparing the unpredictability of the particle to the freedom of the individ ual person. Laws, he argues, do not compel individuals, but simply state statistically how groups of people or particles will behave. I should further suggest that the aberrations permitted the microcosm may occasionally be come important turning points in the path of the macrocosm, lost horseshoe 38 Patrick Horace Nowell-Smith, "Causality," Encyclopedia Britannica, 1957. 39 Presented, among other places, in Bertrand Russell, "On the Notion of Cause, with Applications to the Free-Will Problem" in Herbert Feigl and May Brodbeck (eds.), Readings in the Philosophy of Science, Appleton-Centurv-Crofts, N.Y., 1953, pp. 387-407. 40 Homer Aschmann, "Geography in the Liberal Arts College," Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 52, 1962, p. 291. 41 Rubâiyât, vs. 73. 42 Op. cit., pp. 373-374. 18</page><page sequence="13">nails of history that can never be predicted and seldom be found afterward.43 Given enough time, almost anything can happen. Concern with analyzing what we observe into causes and effects should not prevent us from trying to synthesize them into greater and more mean ingful configurations at the same time. Some of the most common terms we use help us to deal with these configurations: culture, environment, land scape, occupance, region. Denial of the culture-environment and man-nature dualisms offers more synthesis yet.44 Treatment of these synthesizing con cepts may require transcending the old ideas of cause and effect.45 Perhaps causal explanation offers most intelligibility for phenomena on the inter mediate scale, less for microscopic phenomena and macroscopic config urations, both more difficult to observe and measure. If there are directions in which geography can move more effectively without the restraints of causal thinking, it must still deal with cause in a large portion of the ques tions it seeks to answer. Conclusion Finally, I hope this excursion into the complexities of geographical cause may offer some help in reconciling opposing points of view. During the present century American geography has moved from environmentalism through human ecology to a predominantly cultural point of view. (Recently it seems to be showing sympathy for neo-environmentalism.46) It has been my observation that embryo geographers, of the last generation at least, often recapitulate this development in their own changing views. I do not suggest that we try to control the path, but only that encouragement toward logical charting of positions might make the way more meaningful. 43 This points to one of several ways in which explanation and prediction are asymmetrical in the inexact sciences, not simply opposite traverses of a single path.
