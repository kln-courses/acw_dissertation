Helen E. Chapman Aero Space Technologies, Australia Copyright © 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The introduction of FAR23.562 to the Federal Aviation Regulations has necessitated the design and testing of aircraft seats with energy absorbing characteristics to minimize pelvic loads experienced when the seat envi- ronment is subject to specified acceleration pulses. Air- craft seat designers have applied various techniques to facilitate this energy absorption. Generally these tech- niques come at the expense of ease of manufacture and durability. This paper describes the development and testing of seating structures fabricated in a simple and easily reproducible form from sheet aluminium. The design employs both compressive buckling and plastic tensile deformation of the aluminium panels in the seat pan as the means of energy absorption. As the post buckled deflections required to provide sufficient seat stroke are large, the design process does not lend itself to simple theoretical analysis. The experimental develop- ment of a simple seat pan design through representative testing to FAR23.562 is described in this paper. Addition- ally, results of the dynamic load tests are compared with a static load test result and non-linear finite element anal- yses for each of the designs. INTRODUCTION The requirement for dynamic testing of aircraft seats was introduced in 1988 by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve crew and passenger survivability in an emer- gency landing situation. Prior to this, the certification of aircraft seats under emergency landing conditions had been based on static strength requirements alone. Much work has been done since 1988 in the development of aircraft seats to meet the dynamic loading requirement, since most seats designed to meet static strength requirements alone fail to meet the dynamic require- ments. An important aspect of a seat meeting the requirements of FAR23.562 is its ability to absorb the kinetic energy of impact so that spinal loads remain within the limits of human tolerance. Much of the research and development towards developing energy absorbing seats has focused on discrete energy absorb- ing elements being included within the design (see Ref. 1, 2 and 3). Another ápproach has been to design the structural elements of the seat so that they will fail plasti- cally under the impact loads, absorbing as much energy as possible in the process (see Ref. 4 and 5). In the latter cases the design consists of welded tubular members. Typically the design combines tubes that are designed to fail in bending together with tubes designed not to fail, thereby controlling the direction of deflection of the seat. Seat designs incorporating energy absorbing elements provide a reliable means of meeting the requirements of FAR23.562 and allow the tailoring of the energy absorb- ing characteristics of a seat to a specific impact impulse shape. This however comes at the expense of manufac- turing cost and weight. The objective of the current study is the investigation of the feasibility of designing seats utilizing sheet aluminium alloy monocoque construction techniques, that meet the energy absorbing requirements of FAR23.562. These fabrication techniques are well established, and provide a seat that is simple and inexpensive to manufacture. No studies of monocoque sheet metal seat designs have been found in the literature, however. A possible reason for this is the historical tradition of fabricating aircraft seats from welded tubing. Another is possibly the design difficulties associated with predicting the post buckling and deep collapse behavior of monocoque structures. The seat that is the subject of the tests detailed in this paper was originally designed for installation as a second seat in a Gippsland Aeronautics GA200 and GA200C agricultural aircraft (see Figure 1.) The seat is not nor- mally occupied during agricultural operations, its purpose generally being to ferry a ground based assistant to the work site or other passengers when not performing agri- cultural operations. Certification of certain types of air- craft in the restricted category allows FAR23.562 to be excluded from the certification and hence the seat was only required to demonstrate compliance with the static 323</page><page sequence="2">strength requirements. Because the passenger seat was not intended for long occupancy durations, a simplicity of manufacture and light weight were considered to have a higher than usual priority with respect to comfort. As an agricultural aircraft, aesthetics were also of minimal con- cern. The seat base consists of a sheet metal open rect- angular box with a hinged top. The top consists of a plywood panel supporting a urethane foam cushion and fabric dress covering. The sheet metal base is principally fabricated from 0.64 mm (0.025") thick 2024-T3 alumin- ium sheet with additional 0.64 mm (0.025") and 0.81 mm (0.032") thick 2024-T3 gussets, stiffeners and doublers. Figure 2 details the main structural components of the seat base assembly (less cushion assembly.) The seat is mounted in the cockpit via flanges on each four sides riv- eted to the sheet metal floor. The seat back is separately attached to the cockpit structure and the restraint har- ness attaches directly to the fuselage structure (see Fig- ure 3.) Figure 1 . The GA200C Figure 2. Isometric Drawing of Seat Base Due to the simple design and ease of fabrication of this seat, together with a hope that such a design might pro- vide the necessary energy absorbing requirements of FAR23.562, it was decided that it would be worthwhile using this seat design as a developmental prototype for more general sheet aluminium monocoque seat designs. A more general seat design would incorporate conven- tional feet for attachment of the seat to rails, attachment of the seat back and harness to the seat frame, and pos- sibly the ability to adjust seat back angle. Figure 3. Seat and Harness Geometry The dynamic testing requirements specified in FAR23.562 contain requirements for testing the seat under accelerations in two directions. These are an acceleration slightly yawed from the direction of the longi- tudinal axis of the aircraft and an acceleration in a direc- tion thirty degrees forward of vertical (see Figure 4.) The horizontal acceleration requirement is intended primarily to ensure the strength and effectiveness of the restraint system while the mostly vertical acceleration requirement ensures there is sufficient energy absorption to keep pel- vic loads within an acceptable limit. As the seat base is independent of the harness attachment, the thirty degree forward of vertical acceleration case is the primary con- sideration for its design and the only case that is investi- gated in this study. Figure 4. FAR23.562 Requirements DESIGN PROCESS As a direct result of the relatively low cost of manufactur- ing prototypes, the development approach was essen- tially experimental. Starting with a baseline version of the seat, a single design parameter, the material from which the vertical walls of the seat was fabricated was varied. With each iteration the consequences of the parameter 324</page><page sequence="3">change on the design objective was evaluated. The pro- duction seat for the GA200 represented the baseline and was originally designed on the basis of good engineering judgment and experience and validated against static strength requirements by test. The design objective for the seat in the current study was meeting the require- ment of FAR23.562, which, as indicated previously, effec- tively reduces to meeting the maximum force measured between the lumbar spine and pelvis of 6672 Ν (1500 Ibf) in the anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) when deceler- ated from 9.45 m/s (31 ft/s) to a stop with an approxi- mately triangular acceleration pulse with a peak of 19g occurring 0.05 seconds after initial impact (see Figure 4). In order to maximize the energy absorption over as small a deformation of the seat as possible, the lumbar spine-pelvis load should be as close as possible to con- stant at the maximum value during the deceleration. While minimizing the deformation is not a strict require- ment, it is important that the seat does not bottom out during the impact, and so a comfortable margin against this is highly desirable. Initial developmental work proceeded on a dynamic seat testing drop tower developed in-house by Gippsland Aeronautics in Australia. While these tests proved the viability of the seat design in providing the necessary energy absorption characteristics, a lack of availability of an appropriate ATD prevented truly representative data from being collected and made it difficult to refine the design. This was made apparent in 1995 when an exam- ple of the design that had proved successful in meeting the design objectives in tests on the Australian rig, failed to meet the requirements when tested on the test sled at the FAA CAMI facility in Oklahoma City. In July of 1998 a series of on-going tests was commenced at the FAA CAMI facility. These tests have allowed reliable and reproducible data to be gathered in assessing the effects of design changes. During one of the seat dynamic tests the characteristic buckling behavior of the seat was replaced by a tearing failure along the vertical folds that occur at the corners of the seat. It was determined that the fold radius for the particular specimen had not been to specification and consequently localized embrittlement and cracking had occurred at the floor end of the fold. In order to ensure that this mode of failure would not occur again, small soft- eners were added to each lower corner of the seat. Addi- tionally, a test in which the seat cushion or "lid" material was changed was also performed. In the preliminary tests the foam cushion and plywood base were not of a quality suitable for production or meeting flammability requirements. One test was therefore performed in which a cushion fabricated from foam and plywood having the necessary qualities for certification and production pur- poses was utilized to establish the effects of this change on the results. DYNAMIC TEST PROCEDURES The CAMI Biodynamics Lab dynamic impact facility con- sists of a 42.7m track with two precision rails, a sled, winch, and braking system. Figure 5 shows the braking system which consists of a series of steel rods lying across the track. As the sled impacts the steel rods they are extended and extruded through a series of rollers. Varying the lengths of steel rod enables the deceleration pulse to be tailored to requirements. To the test sled was mounted the seat base test article, sufficient structure to provide a geometrically representa- tive seat back and restraint configuration, the ATD, and data acquisition equipment (see Figure 5). The seat and associated structure was mounted at 60 degrees to the direction of impact via a rigid adaptor. The test article was bolted to the adaptor via a total of 9 bolts. The bolts and the stiffness of the adaptor itself provided slightly increased restraint of the seat bases over what is repre- sentative of the installation in the aircraft. Figure 5. General View of Test Sled The ATD used was a Hybrid II for all tests except one. In this case a Hybrid III was used, primarily to test the per- formance of the Hybrid III dummy rather than furthering the development of the seat. The ATD was mounted in the normal upright seated position, centrally located on the test article. The location of the ATD when seated in the normal upright attitude had been previously recorded and this location reproduced with the seat rotated through the required 60 degrees by inserting a 64mm cushion between the seat back and the ATD to allow for the compression of the seat back that occurred due to the weight of the ATD. The ATD=s knees were separated by approximately 1 00mm with the hand placed on the top of its upper legs, just behind the knees. The feet were placed flat against the structure representing the cockpit floor. The ATD was restrained by a modified GA200 harness, attached to the sled in such a manner as to be represen- tative of the actual harness geometry. Due to the size lim- itations of the sled, the harness could not be terminated in the same geometric points as the aircraft. However the 325</page><page sequence="4">appropriate angles were simulated, and this was consid- ered representative for the test. Figure 6 gives a compar- ison of the test rig harness angles against aircraft harness angles for the dummy X-Z plane. It was not pos- sible to provide the same degree of accuracy for the har- ness restraint point locations in the dummy Y-Z plane, however the locations used were considered sufficiently accurate for the purpose of the test. Figure 7 shows the test article mounting with the ATD immediately prior to running the test. Figure 6. Harness Attachment Geometry DYNAMIC TEST RESULTS Table 1 summarizes the six successful tests completed during 1998. An additional test was completed in 1995 in which the walls of the seat base being tested were fabri- cated from 0.81mm (0.032") thick 2024-T3. This wall thickness provided the seat base with excessive stiffness and the resulting lumbar spine-pelvis load was consider- ably greater than the maximum allowable. The tests con- ducted in 1998 therefore investigated the performance of seat bases fabricated from 0.81 mm (0.032") 6061 -T6 aluminium (an alloy with lower strength than 2024-T3), 0.51 mm (0.020") and 0.64mm (0.025") thick 2024-T3 aluminium. These represent the commonly available gauges of aluminium sheet thinner than the 0.81mm (0.032") gauge. The material from which the stiffening angles, gussets and brace plate were fabricated was not altered between tests. Test results are summarized in Table 2. The peak lumbar spine-pelvic load was less than the allowable maximum for all tests except the first. Of the tests in which the lum- bar spine-pelvic load was less than the maximum allow- able, the seat did not bottom out for the last three tests only, in which 0.64mm thick 2024-T3 was used in con- junction with corner stiffening angles. Each test was recorded with a high speed digital video camera. Review of the recording in slow motion revealed much about the progress of the buckling defor- mation. In general, from the moment of impact the defor- mation of the seat commenced with the bending deformation of the upper longitudinal stiffening rails. This was followed by the buckling collapse of the side, front and rear vertical panels. In most cases the buckling of the side panels was outwards, with inflections at the cor- ners. The final deformed shape of the longitudinal stiffen- ing rails at the top of the box was a reasonably sharp "V" shape, the maximum stroke of the seat occurring at the vertex of the "V". The maximum stroke occurred approxi- mately 200 to 230 mm aft of the front of the seat (see Fig- ure 8). The final position of the seat cushion indicated minimal rotation about the lateral or dummy "Y" axis and minimal shearing forward during all tests. The exception to this deformation process was test 3 in which tears ran up each of the four vertical corners of the box upon initial impact. Subsequent to this the four sides collapsed out- wards in conventional two dimensional long column buck- ling (see Figure 9) The cause of this mode of failure was determined to be the result of a smaller than specified bend radius at the corners of the seat causing cracks to form at the lower corners of the seat and embrittlement along the extent of the corner fold.. Subsequent tests specimens included stiffening angles at the lower corners to prevent this mode of failure from recurring. Table 1 .

Seat and ATD Prior to Test Figure 8. Post Impact Seat (Test No. 6) Figure 9. Post Impact Seat (Test No. 3) Figures 10 through 21 detail the sled acceleration and lumbar spin-pelvic load responses for each of the six load tests. The pelvic force response plots where reviewed in conjunction with the high speed digital video recording of the impact enabling a correlation between features of the plots and events in the buckling collapse of the seat base. In all cases, the peaks in the pelvic force response coin- cide with the initialization of buckling of the side walls of the seat base. This is observed as a distinct folding of the longitudinal stiffening rails and a flare of reflected light from the side wall immediately below the fold point. For tests 2 and 3, in which the deflections bottomed out, the local minima at around 100 ms corresponded with the bottoming out of the seat. Despite test 2 being a case in which the seat bottomed out, the shape of the curve prior to bottoming out shows the characteristic shape apparent in the results of tests 4 through 6 in which there is an intermediate point at which the pelvic load levels off momentarily. For test 2 this leveling off occurs at around 2000 Ν while for tests 4 through 6 it occurs at around 4000 N. This response shape appears to be a character- istic of the deep collapse behavior of the seat base. Observation of the deep collapse behavior shows a series of "short column" type local buckles occurring suc- cessively as the seat collapses. Figure 10. Sled Acceleration Time History Figure 1 1 .

Sled Acceleration Time History A comparison of the lumbar spine-pelvic load response of test 4 and 5 with test 6 provides an indication of the effect of a change in the seat cushion. For tests 4 and 5 the cushion comprised a very low density urethane foam that was effectively crushed to negligible thickness by the weight of the ATD. The foam used in the cushion for test 6 consisted of two one inch layers of Confer foam, the fewer layer a high density CF-47 foam, the upper layer a lower density CF-42 foam. The lower density CF-42 was still considerably denser and resistant to deformation than the foam used in previous tests. The effect of this change immediately apparent from the response plots is the smoothing out of the pelvic load response curve for the higher density foams. The peak load, however, does not appear to vary with foam density. The "leveling off" characteristic remains apparent in the response, but at a slightly fewer level. Figure 21 . Lumbar Spine - Pelvic Force Response The maximum distance through which the seat was crushed, or "stroke", is detailed in the last column of Table 2. This value represents an average of the dis- placement from its original position of the point at the ver- tex of the "V" of the bent longitudinal stiffening rails (left and right.) The consistency of the measured stroke results reflect the consistency of the lumbar spine-pelvic load results. As stated previously, in tests 2 and 3 the seat bottomed out. In tests 4 through 6 the seat was only crushed through approximately 36% of the available stroke. The excessive stiffness of the seat base used in test 1 is further indicated by the deflection of only about 15mm for this test. STATIC LOAD TEST AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS RESULTS The finite element analysis of the seat base utilized a non-linear solver enabling the effects of large displace- ments and non-linear material properties to be incorpo- rated in the solution. Solutions were obtained for the three wall thicknesses that were used in the dynamic tests. The solution process involved obtaining non-linear solutions at a series of increasing increments of applied load. The load continued being incremented until the non-linear solver was unable to iterate towards a solution. The inability to generate a solution is assumed to corre- spond with elastic instability of the structure. Through this procedure it was possible to obtain an approximate value of the ultimate static strength of the seat base. The finite element models were composed of 501 9-node quadrilateral shell elements. All three models incorpo- rated the stiffening angle introduced after test 3 even though the seat bases in which 0.51 mm wall thickness 329</page><page sequence="8">and 0.81 mm wall thickness were tested did not include this stiffening angle. This discrepancy was not expected to influence results significantly. The model is illustrated in Figure 22, different shadings representing different property types (shell thicknesses.) The load was applied in a triangular distribution across nine nodes, centered at a point on the upper edge of the side wall 225 mm aft of the front wall of the seat (approximately the location of the vertex of the buckling fold in the stiffening rails observed in the dynamic test specimens.) The load was distributed over a length of approximately 12 mm, repre- senting a reasonably concentrated loading. It was found that varying the length over which the load was distrib- uted had a significant influence on the critical load. The concentrated loading was used as the resulting deforma- tions best matched those observed in the dynamic tests. The results of the finite element analysis are given in Table 3. The deformed shape in combination with stress contours for each of the cases at the load increments immediately prior to elastic instability are given in Figures 23 through 25. The displacements have been exagger- ated by a scale factor of ten for clarity. Table 3.

Deformed Finite Element Model Figure 25. Deformed Finite Element Model The final seat configuration was sufficiently removed from the original design to suggest that it was necessary to repeat static tests to show compliance with FAR23.785. A combination of the "G" loading due to light-weight gust, and a 97.5 kg occupant weight resulted in a total force of 731 1 N, equivalent to a weight of 746 kg. The seat was loaded by firstly positioning an early series ATD in the appropriate seating position. The test was completed by incrementally adding lead weights to the lap of the ATD seated on the base. This method of loading had been chosen, as it did make some allowance for the unstable nature of the distributed mass with a center of gravity some vertical distance from the base. When the applied loading reached 7340 Ν the test was concluded, as this instability would result in total failure. Figure 26 shows that point of the test. Elastic buckling deformations were noted which were consistent with the deformations of the dynamic tests. Figure 27 was taken during a somewhat simple loading test using a hydraulic jack, load cell, and the lower torso of the ATD. The seat was statically loaded to failure, though it was appreciated that such a simple test and instrumentation could only give general results. In this case, the rear face and corners of the seat failed, most likely due to the static loading being a poor representa- tion of the load vectors during the dynamic test. Never- theless a peak load of 7350N was measured, which 330</page><page sequence="9">through a series of troughs decayed to 5800N after approximately one inch of deflection. Figure 26. Static Test Loading to 7340 Ν Figure 27. Static Test to 7350 Ν CONCLUSIONS While the current study of the performance of sheet metal monocoque seats with respect to energy absorbing char- acteristics lacks sufficient detail to enable generalized conclusions, the results do provide encouragement that this type of seat construction has the potential to fulfil the requirements of FAR23.562. The results do show that despite the chaotic behavior of the structure in deep col- lapse, the dynamic response of the lumbar spine-pelvic load appears to be reasonably consistent and therefore somewhat independent of this behavior. The dynamic response of the lumbar spine-pelvic load for the design under consideration contains two distinct fea- tures, a sharp peak at the point of maximum load, and a period of relatively constant load during the deep col- lapse deformation. This type of response is typical of the crushing behavior of thin wall rectangular box columns (see Ref. 6.) For a successful design the peak must be less than the maximum allowable load and the leveled off load high enough that it will be sufficient to absorb the occupant kinetic energy within the available stroke of the seat. For the design studied here it was possible to meet the maximum allowable lumbar spine-pelvic load require- ment while only using approximately 36% of the available stroke. As long as the sheet metal being crushed can be assumed to be strain rate insensitive, the seat should be capable of meeting the lumbar spine-pelvic load require- ments for higher peak g loadings than that considered in this study, i.e. greater than 19g. Static load tests and non-linear finite element analysis will only be useful if the relationship between lumbar spine-pelvic load and load applied to the seat base can be further developed. Mathematical models do exist for this relationship (Ref. 7), and their use may at least pro- vide a means of estimating the peak lumbar spin-pelvic load for design purposes. Predicting the ability of the seat to absorb the required amount of energy within the available stroke would require the use of advanced analy- sis techniques such as the use of Superfolding Elements (see Ref. 6). However, given the availability of dynamic testing facilities for development work and the application of good engineering judgement, it would seem possible from the results of this study that a successful design may be arrived at within a small number of iterations.
