<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT CORA AND HUICHOL ART: THE KONRAD T. PREUSS COLLECTION Editorial Konrad T. Preuss's Mexican Adventure Margarita de Orellana A hundred years have gone by since an inquisitive and determined German anthropologist named Konrad Theodor Preuss arrived in Mexico. His goal was to study and live with indigenous communities that had always avoided contact with outsiders: Huicholes, Coras, Mexicaneros and Tepehuanes. For centuries, these cultures have retained a strong sense of identity, and kept their traditions alive. Preuss was convinced that a better understanding of their spiritual life would offer him insight into the religion of the ancient Mexica culture. How does one even begin to imagine Preuss's first contact with those tribes? He was aware of the achievements of other anthropologists who had gone before him and also of what they had endured. How did he react to the hostility or indifference with which these communities may have greeted him? How was he able to establish such open communication with them, one that would reveal keys to under standing their cultures? What resources did an anthropologist such as Preuss need a hundred years ago in order to enter such diverse and not always friendly worlds? We know that Preuss attended many Cora, Huichol and Mexicanero rituals. He transcribed their songs and prayers, recorded their music and described their dances. He collected about 2300 craft objects, most of them ritual in nature. He was an active participant in the agricultural ceremonies known as mitotes, sharing in the ecstatic experience produced by the music, dancing and peyote consumption. Later, he would remember them as the most interesting moments in his long stay in rural Mexico. In his diary he exclaimed, "How paltry is the mere aesthetic experience compared to the sensation of watching the ritual after one has also understood the intellectual forces that explain the origins of all this!" In this issue of Artes de México, a selection of the ritual objects that Preuss acquired in this country will be shown publicly for the first time in a hundred years. This collection has been preserved all these years du§ to the fact that it is housed, along with Preuss's field notes and journal, at the Berlin Ethnologi cal Museum (part of the Dahlem Museum Center), which has generously allowed us access to them and to publish photographs of them. This is the second time that we have had the opportunity to work with this institution and its curators (see Artes de México issue no. 17 on the Dahlem Museums surprising collection of pre-Hispanic sculptures). We are once again fortunate to have Johannes Neurath as the is sue coordinator. He was previously the guest editor of our colorful and very popular issue on Huichol art (Artes de México issue no. 75). As if pulling treasures one by one out of a chest, at the Dahlem Museum we were able to inspect each of these precious objects that we are pleased to share with our readers here. Preuss believed that these pieces were not precisely offerings to the gods. They were used in religious practices, and their manufac ture formed part of the rituals: non-verbal dramatizations of the myth, as Preuss called them. The objects were magical instruments that sustained the existence of the gods and the movement of the world. They were tools that helped the gods in their activities. In retrospect, the aesthetic value of these pieces is in creased by our knowledge of their meaning. Many of these pieces are like tiny, symbolically-charged worlds that provide us a glimpse of the spiri tual dimension of these ancient cultures that are still alive today, and whose existence continues to be governed by myths and rites. Mexico is deeply indebted to the many foreign scholars who have helped open our eyes to our own cultural wealth. This issue of Artes de México is intended as a tribute to the memory of Konrad Theodor Preuss, a German pioneer of Mexican ethnology, and an account of the Mexican adventure that he em barked on a century ago.o ANCIENT CORA AND HUICHOL ART: THE KONRAD T.

He studied geogra phy and history at the University of Kónigsberg (now Kalinin grad, Russia) and in 1894 presented his doctoral thesis, "The Funerary Customs of Indigenous Americans and Northeastern Asians." It is worth noting that even in this early scientific work, he tended to oppose the monotheistic supposition of a body soul dualism in referring to the religions of ethnic groups. It was due to his rejection of this notion that he was able in subse quent works to address theoretical problems concerning magic, art and ritual. Like many of the first generation of German anthropologists, Preuss was a disciple of Adolf Bastian in Berlin. He took courses in ethnology at Friedrich Wilhelm University and joined the staff of the Royal Museum of Ethnology as a scientific assistant in their Oceania and Africa departments. Inspired by Eduard Seler, a pioneer in the study of pre-His panic codices and Sahagún's manuscripts and at that time curator of the museum's Americas department, he soon changed course to focus on Mexican studies, publishing a series of articles on the Mexica religion at the turn of the century. Nevertheless, unlike his mentor Seler—who increasingly focused on Mesoamerican studies during these years—Preuss always kept up his general anthropological interests, particularly in the field of ritual theory. Influenced by classical philologists, folklorists and historians of contemporary religion—many of whom belonged to Hermann Usener's influential school—he demonstrated a great interest in the comparisons made between the Aztecs and other ancient civilizations, such as the classic Greeks and the Vedic Hindus. In his earliest essays on Mexico, Preuss suggested that Aztec human sacrifice should be seen as the sacrifice of demons, in tended to increase the magical powers of deities associated with natural phenomena. In fact, in his view, all forms of artistic ex pression, as well as sacrifice and the staging of ritual battles and coitus, stemmed from magical acts aimed at bringing blessings and abundance. According to this line of thought, what set the gods apart from other beings was the fact that they possessed magical powers, though in the strict sense they were supposed to be seen as objects in the natural world, distinguished only by their ability to transform themselves. Although at this stage, Preuss conceived of rituals as the non verbal dramatization of myths—following the tenets of the school of natural mythology—by the end of the decade, rituals had gained greater theoretical autonomy in Preuss's thinking, and he focused more on their particular kind of symbolization. Starting in 1904, Preuss began to investigate the relationship between an cient Mexican culture and its extensions in northern America. In The Sun's Battle against the Stars in Mexico, he set out the results of his quest for a cohesive concept that would reveal the unifying principles behind the enormous variety of phenomena present in ancient Mexican religion. What ideas were there underlying the beliefs and worldview of the peoples who shared this cultural tra dition? "Mexican religion strikes most researchers as so strange that until now, the quantity and variety of images have stood in the way of any attempt to discover some uniformity in them," he writes. "However, only a uniform conception of an evolving his tory capable of explaining all the facts can ensure the validity of all the particular relationships established, as well as the most general interpretations. One of the nodal points required to achieve such a uniform conception is the struggle between the Sun and the stars." Although he was identified with the trend known as astralism, which arose following discoveries about the astronomy of the Babylonians and other ancient Old World civilizations, Preuss was no uncritical partisan of that school of thought. He found it unacceptable to replace the understanding of an entire cultural tradition with crude labels by employing terms like "Sun wor ship," "snake worship" or "fetishism." A clearer formulation of his stance on the subject can be found in a 1910 work, The Observation of Nature in the Religions of the Mexican Cultural Sphere. In it, he asserts that, "Every eth nologist must concur that progress in the science of the religion of primitive tribes depends primarily on research into the ob servation of nature, which serves as the basis for the form and essence of divine beings. Gods are thus constructed not from depth of feeling or anything else; instead, it is a matter of effec tive forces that are questioned by man, and whose power has in some way been lodged in mans perception." Nor did Preuss believe that ideas about natural forces and the gods could be attributed solely to nature's influence. On the contrary, he said, "Within man himself lies the desire to impart magical influences to his natural surroundings." Preuss' expedition to the region known as El Gran Nayar was no doubt directly motivated by Lumholtz's studies of the Huichol Indians. Seler himself had already published a lengthy article in which he reorganized the Norwegian explorer's materials ac cording to Mexicanist criteria. It appeared obvious to Seler and Preuss that Lumholtz had neglected to record indigenous ritual texts in their native language and failed to take the heuristic im portance of contemporary religious rituals into account when interpreting aspects of ancient Mexican civilizations. In every instance, the Berliners approached the ethnography of El Gran Nayar in the light of their Mesoamerican interests and from their ethnophilological perspective. It was Seler who proposed the idea for a German expedition to El Gran Nayar. As M. Rutsch points out, Seler and Boas had planned from the start to organize an international expedition to the Huicholes' mountain enclaves in collaboration with muse ums in New York and Berlin. In Seler's view, however, Preuss was not the ideal candidate to see it through, as neither his linguistic skills nor his "speculative theories" had gained Seler's trust. It was the geographer Von Richthofen who was able to turn things in Preuss's favor, and he was officially put in charge of the enter prise by Prussia's Ministry of Religion, Education and Medicine and the Royal Museums' general administration. Financing was to be provided by the foundation that Joseph-Florimond, the Duke of Loubat, had established in Berlin to fund the chair in Linguistics, Archaeology and Ethnology in the Americas. 74 Paulina Alcocer</page><page sequence="3">Ritual combat during Easter celebrations, Jesús Maria, Nayarit, 1923.

Documents at the Berlin Ethnological Museum provide in formation on the original plans for Preusss expedition to Mexico. The goal was "to study Indian antiquities and tribes in western Mexico, in particular, the states of Jalisco, Tepic, Zacatecas, Du rango, Sinaloa, Chihuahua and Sonora." The expedition was justified by the fact that "the museum possesses practically no archaeological or ethnological materials from there," despite the importance they might have to studies of ancient Mexican cul tures, given that these "native tribes are linguistically related to the Aztecs. Their religious life in particular will help to clarify, in retrospect, the culture of ancient Mexico, and to interpret picto graphic manuscripts with mythological and religious content." Preuss' expedition to western Mexico was thus originally geared toward the exploration of archaeological sites that were at tributed to the Chichimecas, such as La Quemada. The archaeo logical objects were to be illegally transported to Berlin, in order to enrich the world-famous collections of Prussia's Royal Muse um of Ethnology. The objective of the ethnological study of the mountain tribes was to obtain information about their myths that might prove useful in interpreting the expeditions finds. To the majority of Berlin-based Mexicanists, the conceptions of living Indians were but the impoverished remains of their past glory. Preuss reversed the order of priorities. Choosing to respect current Mexican legislation which prohibited the export of antiq uities, he embarked on an ethnographic study of the mountain dwellers. He spent half a year among the Coras, nine months with the Huicholes and another three months with the Mexi caneros. Though Seler, his direct superior in Berlin, repeatedly exhorted him not to neglect the archaeological aspect, in the end Preuss paid him no mind and devoted the entire expedition to the indigenous population of the Sierra Madre Occidental. He focused chiefly on transcribing and translating ritual texts. Using a sophisticated payment system, he convinced several re ligious specialists to dictate ceremonial songs to him, word for word. In all, Preuss filled thirteen 400-page notebooks and came close to running out of paper up in the mountains. Based on these philological studies, Preuss developed a new theory of Mesoamerican religion. Magical objects (such as gourd bowls, arrows or small wooden pyramids) served to ensure the connection between the gods and the world. But this magic was not governed by a utilitarian teleology. Ritual objects were not meant to manipulate nature. The miniature pyramid was a rep lica of the sky. Whatever happened to an object also occured on the macrocosmic level. Unlike Lumholtz, who had gained some celebrity as a field researcher even before travelling to the Sierra Madre Occidental, Preuss was every inch the armchair anthropologist, with nearly a hundred scientific publications to his name when he departed on his first expedition. As an ethnological professional, Preuss had little use for the old-school style of naturalist research so familiar to Lumholtz, who had moved freely across a spectrum of disci plines ranging from geology to ethnology. Preuss was a research 75 Ritual combat during Easter celebrations, Jesús Maria, Nayarit, 1923. National Museum of the American Indian. Smithsonian Institution.

By the time he began working in the field, hed already thoroughly developed his hypotheses, to the extent that the empirical data obtained in El Gran Nayar seemed to fit his theories a little too neatly. In discussing Preuss, however, it must be remembered that there have been few great theorists in anthropological history to have actually performed in-depth field research. Preuss knew how to combine theoretical specula tion with empirical research in a way that few others did. The initial hypothesis that guided his fieldwork among the Coras, Huicholes and Mexicaneros was that any understand ing of ancient Mexico should begin with a detailed study of the mountain "tribes." Furthermore, to perform a valid analysis of the religions of Mexico's ethnic groups, it was indispensable to obtain traditional texts in the vernacular tongue. After the expe dition, Preuss analyzed the abundant corpus of oral literature us ing classical philological methods. In his interpretation of rituals, he developed Usener's approach: ritual art is part of the "means of religious expression." In other words, it can be located on the same analytical plane as songs and dances.O Translated by Daniel C. Schechter. ETHNOGRAPHIC DETERMINATION Exploring the Living Cultures of the Nayar Manuela Fischer, Richard Haas and Edith The is Preuss took great care in making the preparations for his trip to Mexico. Documents housed by the Berlin Ethnological Museum attest that he took intensive Spanish courses at the Berlitz Institute, and that he obtained letters of recommenda tion for the various Mexican governmental agencies from the Prussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He left Germany early in 1905. In Paris, he met with Léon Diguet (1859-1926), a longtime researcher of the Coras and Huicholes. When Preuss boarded the America at the port of Cherbourg, his luggage included a wooden box, a crate of rifles, a tin suitcase, clothing, a tent, a bed and two packages of letters. He stopped in New York, taking advantage of the opportunity to visit Franz Boas (1859-1943), staying at his house and discuss ing his plans with him. While in the Empire City, Lumholtz him self gave Preuss an introduction to his former field of study, which the younger man would cultivate earnestly from then on. From New York, Preuss traveled to the port of Veracruz, accompanied by the Mayan studies expert Edward Herbert Thomson (1860 1935). He then took the train to Mexico City where he spent some enjoyable evenings at the home of Celia Nuttall (1857-1933), a specialist in Mayan codices, and met with the archaeologists Al fredo Chavero (1841-1906) and Antonio Peñafiel (1839-1922) as well as the ethnologist Nicolás León (1859-1929). Preuss then traveled by rail to Guadalajara, finally reaching the terminal of San Marcos, Jalisco. From there, he continued his journey to Tepic by stagecoach. In Tepic, he procured pack ani mals and the necessary provisions, with the assistance of Eugen Hildebrandt, consul for the German Empire, and his business partner, Maximilian Delius. He also obtained letters of introduc tion on behalf of the governors of Jalisco and Durango as well as Tepic's political leader. In the numerous reports and letters he sent back to Germany, Preuss documented the details of his journey. The file of certifi cates relating to Preuss's position as an employee of the Berlin Royal Museum of Ethnology contained letters addressed to his immediate superior, Eduard Seler, the director of the Americas section and at that time his main academic liaison. There are other letters addressed to his colleague and personal friend Max Schmidt (1874-1950), as well as reports with a more official tone addressed to the Prussian Ministry of Religion, Edu cation and Medicine. In these missives, Preuss told of the strides hed made in his research and provided a glimpse of the often adverse conditions of life in the sierra. There's no doubt that for a native of Prussia, the climate in Jesús María Canyon would hard to withstand, reaching temperatures of up to 45°C (110°F) in the shade. He also sent versions of these reports to the editors of several German scientific journals, such as Globus: Illustrierte Zeitschrift für Lander- und Vólkerkunde (Brunswick); Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde (Berlin); Archiv für Religionswissen schaften (Leipzig) and Zeitschrift für Ethnologie (Berlin). As regu lar mail service had been established in Cora territory as early as 1892, Preuss took advantage of the situation by sending his writ ings to Tepic. From there his compatriot Delius, a locally based businessman, forwarded them to Germany, where they were pub lished within a few weeks of the time they were written. On December 24, 1905, Preuss sent Seler the following let ter: "Most distinguished Herr Professor: Tomorrow at seven in the morning I plan to embark on my journey to Cora territory. After spending Christmas Eve at the home of the local consul, I want to brief him on the route of my journey and my plans. Soon after I arrived in the capital, it became clear to me how difficult it is to export antiquities from Mexico. Therefore I shall not make any collection trips to the Chichimeca zone in question, mainly because it would mean too great a depletion in my funds. And so I have postponed all that and have begun to plot my trip to Cora territory. [...] Eventually, should it become necessary to return to Tepic, I could perform excavations near the sea. Some tombs have already been recommended to me. There are still down pours here which last a good part of the day, causing floods, and this has delayed my departure." Preuss left Tepic on Christmas Day of 1905, bound for Jesús María Chuísete'e via the royal road. He arrived there six days later. He immediately commenced his ethnographic study of the Coras and remained among them until June 1906, allowing him to wit ness many of the rituals associated with the dry season. His base of operations was the Jesús María-San Francisco de Paula road in the scorching river gorge where the Coras lived, although he also vis ited the Nayar mesa in the high part of the sierra. At that time there were 1500 indigenous people and 100 mestizos (persons of mixed race) in Jesús María, the municipal and ecclesiastic seat of the Cora region, which was far less densely populated than it is today. Of the three groups he studied, the Coras turned out to be the most reluctant to participate in the ethnographic investigation. During the first month, he only managed to secure the collabo 76 Daniel C. Schechter. Manuela Fischer, Richard Haas and Edith Theis</page><page sequence="5">ration of Francisco Molina, an indigenous man who had fought alongside Lozada in 1873. Actually, Molina no longer practiced his ancestors' religion, but he was the only qualified interpreter available, since the other Coras spoke little or no Spanish. After his first two months in the mountains, Preuss seemed to have overcome any initial difficulties. In a letter to Seler he wrote, "Until this point, my study of the Coras has been limited. During the two months I've lived among them, I managed to attend their most important ceremony, the mitote dance. I also documented the mitote songs—twenty-three in all—as well as the most im portant prayers, and translated them from the Cora language. I was even able to record most of the songs on my phonograph. These songs are very ancient and reveal absolutely foundational concepts, despite the fact that these indigenous people have ad opted a large number of Catholic customs. [...] "The songs can be compared to the extraordinary Aztec songs that have been handed down to us by Sahagún. In general, many customs go back to the pre-Hispanic era. During the mitote, for instance, I saw a child who personifies the morning star and con quers the other stars which take the guise of the deer character. [...] Similarly, the ballgame using ones buttocks was still being played here a decade ago. I hope to make a valuable contribu tion to an understanding of the ancient Mexicans, and I've ascer tained with great satisfaction that many of my interpretations of the ceremonies have been confirmed by the Coras." Preuss had not even spent four months in the mountains when he addressed a letter to the general administration of the Berlin Museums to explain why he needed to extend his stay another full year. Eduard Seler backed his request, though in his reply to Preuss, he could not help but express the dilemma faced by German an thropologists of the day, which affected even Seler s own interests. Although they were responsible for all aspects of ethnological re search in addition to university instruction, the ethnologists' main obligation was to amass museum collections. Thus Seler urged Preuss to collect archaeological objects from western Mexico. Under the circumstances, Preuss was quick to underline his progress in this task. In a letter dated March 14, 1906, he wrote, "Thus far, I've managed to amass a collection of 400 Cora items including ritual instruments and art objects." But true to the plans of the founding director of the Berlin Royal Museum of Ethnology—who had stated that an ethno graphic collection should not be simply an accumulation of ex otic objects but also include materials that would allow a culture to be documented in all its aspects—Preuss proposed something more than a mere collecting expedition. Instead, he insisted on carrying out in-depth ethnological research based on transcrib ing texts in the indigenous languages while noting the difficulty in completing such a project in the time allotted. In a letter ad dressed to the general administration of the museums he stated that, "The indigenous area of the Sierra Madre [... ] strikes me as a single vast whole, and it would be impossible to cover all of it in a year—not even by restricting my attention to its main features. And by choosing to limit it to a single tribe, one would be unable to solve most of the problems, since they can only be addressed in the context of the other tribes." In April 1906, Seler wrote Preuss from Rome to inform him of the difficulty he had encountered in trying to find additional funds for the expedition, mainly because the museum's Americas section was already deep in debt. While congratulating him on the strides he'd made thus far, Seler said two dry seasons ought to be more than enough to compile a lifetime's worth of materials for study and recommended that Preuss curtail his goals, adding a subtle reminder that the main objective of the trip was to "com pile archaeological materials from the Zacatecas area." He further wrote, "I do not reproach you for considering other goals as your principal task, nor that you've dedicated yourself, and want to continue dedicating yourself, to them exclusively. The success you've had so far justifies your decision." In his response, dated May 13, 1906, Preuss made no mention of Seler's instructions. On the contrary, he raised the need to devote at least a year's study to each of the region's four ethnic groups. Even though Preuss' expedition was moving ahead at full speed, he experienced his fair share of adversity and obstacles. In a letter addressed to Max Schmidt in May, Preuss had this to say: "The indigenous people [Coras] have eyed me with great suspicion the whole time, and my presence always makes them uneasy. Nevertheless, I've attended their ceremonies and dances, both in the town and up in the hills. In the towns of Jesús Maria and San Francisco, I found men willing to dictate their songs, tales and prayers to me. Two other Cora towns were too far away, so I visited them only briefly. It took money to accomplish my goals, but I also had the help of a priest who lived alone among the Coras." With the commencement of the rains, Preuss moved to Hui chol territory and rented the San Isidro ranch, which became his headquarters from late June to early October 1906, during the rainy season. He returned to Jesús María for the mitote as sociated with the first fruits. In January, he settled in San Andrés (Teteikie), staying at the mission of the Catholic priest. In mid February he moved to Santa Catarina (Tuapurie), finally finish ing his work among the Huicholes in late March 1907. Of his extended stay in San Isidro, Preuss had this to say: "The indigenous people visited me daily, and I returned the visits, mainly on the occasion of their many fiestas. I labored daily on transcribing their texts, thus obtaining a large part of my collec tion. It was a truly difficult job, since the Huichol language—like that of the Coras—is practically unknown, though there was an advantage here in that the Huicholes were easier to deal with than the Coras. The latter are infinitely more reserved but also more prone to violence, since they're more fearless. The Huicho les, in contrast, only become belligerent and boastful at their fiestas, which they attend in droves, with both the men and the women getting drunk. In these situations, the hatred they feel toward foreigners comes to the fore and they accuse us of steal ing their lands. A further difficulty of working here is that the ranch communities are widely scattered and normally consist of no more than five little houses. Many of these include sev eral dwellings with cornfields between them. Furthermore, the people customarily make extended forays for commercial activi ties or to visit their places of worship, so it can be hard to track them down. The Huicholes are generally poorer and their terrain rougher. By four or five months before the harvest, you already begin to notice a lack of food. Wild fruits and roots are eaten during these times of scarcity." 77</page><page sequence="6">•¿K.Wjf£jL Cora game bags from Jesús María, Nayarit. With San Isidro as his base, Preuss made several excursions through Huichol territory: "Another three-week excursion took me to Guadalupe Ocotan, on the other side of the Chapalagana River, where I had the chance to witness four fiestas. [...] Work ing here was occasionally uncomfortable, mostly because the Huicholes fear that I am searching for mines. They think my camera is some kind of metal detector." While among the Huicholes, in addition to the aid of a Cora Indian named Molina, Preuss hired José María Carrillo and later Ramón N. to serve as intermediaries. They were bilingual and well-acquainted with the outside world. He invariably paid these informants for their services, though he noted that the wages demanded by the Coras were much higher than those earned by the Huicholes; even so, a days salary was three times that of a farmhand. Additionally, special bonuses were awarded to those storytellers who were able to work with him throughout some of the longer sessions. He was not ashamed to acknowledge that indigenous people would come to his camp to "sell" him myths. Once the expedition's objectives were understood, his assistants would also be responsible for selecting ethnographic pieces for the museum collections. Some of them earned commissions for finding objects. Sometimes the pieces would be paid for in cash; other times theyd be traded for cloth, beads or wool. On certain occasions, as in the case in Santa Catarina, a form of reciprocal donation did the job; gifts for cultural testimony. Meanwhile, the anthropologist focused on transcribing texts and observing ritu als. The line-by-line translations were done in situ, in collabora tion with his assistants, and a more detailed version was done later. One of his employees learned to use the camera, helping out with photo documentation. Due to the technical require ments of the time, Preuss had to develop his own pictures. During these trips, his collaborators obtained the necessary authorizations to visit sacred sites and negotiated the collection of pieces for the museums. Where necessary, Preuss would use official recommendations to facilitate his research activities. Due to complications with customs in the port of San Bias, it was no easy matter for Preuss to ship his collections to Berlin. In a letter he sent to Max Schmidt from San Isidro, Preuss com plained that the customs officers unpacked everything, despite Delius s attempts to intervene, so in the long run, it turned out to be more practical to transport the objects overland from Tepic to Tampico for shipment to Europe. During his time with the Huicholes, Preuss had gone through the 15,000 marks hed originally budgeted for a year's stay. To solve his financial problems, he made a deal with the Municipal Museum of Ethnology in Hamburg to sell them an ethnographic collection valued at 3500 marks, "without prejudicing the Berlin museums interests." Finally, at the beginning of April 1907, he traveled to the town of San Pedro Jicora, in the region of the Mexicaneros. As Preuss noted in another letter to Max Schmidt, "The Aztecs have always been my aspiration." From Jesús María, he followed a route that passed through San Francisco, San Juan Peyotán, Huazamota and San Antonio. Amid these accessible indigenous people, whom he would come to consider the most civilized of the three tribes, he found the most collaborative informants. He rented a house on the town square and hired two locals to take him to most highly re spected storytellers. He summarized the spirit of his field work as, "Living peacefully alongside the people, sharing their joys and hardships." Preuss realized that the Mexicaneros were not, as he'd sup posed, the missing link between the ancient Aztecs and present day Coras and Huicholes, although certain characters in Nahua texts—referred to simply as "devils"—do shed some light on cer tain deities of ancient Mexico. 78 Cora game bags from Jesús María, Nayarit.</page><page sequence="7">There was one problem that he could never have anticipated: with such a wealth of textual material, his supply of paper could run out—something that almost came to pass. He had been planning to stay with the Mexicaneros until the end of the rainy season, and even to visit the Tepehuanes and Tarahumaras, but then he contracted malaria and his funds again began to run low. He left San Pedro Jicora on June 25, 1907. On his way to the Mesa del Nayar and Jesús María he passed through the town of Santa Teresa (Cueimarutsee), in the most elevated part of Cora territory. As the rivers rose, he had to leave his most valuable collections behind in Jesús María with the intention of shipping them later, after the end of monsoon season. He reached Tepic on July 14, 1907. Once in Tepic, he found that 4000 marks had arrived from Berlin to help him continue with his research. Had he known that these funds would be made available to him, he would have attempted to research the Tepehuanes, despite his malaria. In a letter written in mid-August aboard the ship Albingia, he noted, "My return journey from Tepic was deplorable. It took a while for my stomach to get used to a meat diet, and in ad dition, I continued to suffer from bouts of malaria. I was glad to have embarked without becoming seriously ill. I am feeling much better now." Preuss had a number of reasons to feel satisfied with the results of his expedition. In a report addressed to the Ministry of Religion, he enumerated the expeditions accomplishments as follows: "1. An extraordinarily rich body of indigenous texts in three different languages (Cora, Huichol, Mexicano), unlike anything known today among the people of Mexico and Central America. The texts, with interlinear translations, fill about thir teen 400-page notebooks, and comprise 293 myths, hundreds of long chants and songs, and numerous prayers. The entirety of this corpus was transcribed directly from the indigenous people themselves, who have no written language, and then translated by indigenous interpreters, who possessed only the most rudi mentary knowledge of Spanish. 2. Material to produce grammar books for two languages—Cora and Huichol—that were virtu ally unknown until now and are quite different from each other. [... ] 3. Detailed descriptions of or information on the rituals and ceremonies of the tribes in question. 4. A collection of around 300 selected ethnological objects. [...] 5. Around seventy wax phonograph cylinders with songs and prayers in the Huichol and Cora languages. [...] 6. Nearly a thousand photographs, demonstrating every aspect of indigenous life and the natural environment." The ethnographic collection sent to the Museum of Hamburg comprised 400 Huichol and 150 Cora objects. In the 1920s, the Berlin Museum sold a small part of the Preuss collection to Swe den's Gothenburg Museum. Based on his scholarly research during the trip to Mexico, Preuss published numerous articles on the Coras, as well as one monograph in 1912, "The Expedition to Nayarit I: The Cora Re ligion." Some unpublished manuscripts on Huichol texts were lost during World War II. Part of the material from the Mexi caneros was published posthumously between 1968 and 1976, edited by Elsa Ziehm.O Translated by Daniel C. Schechter. DETERMINATION TO UNDERSTAND The Use of Magical Instruments Paulina Alcocer and Johannes Neurath The expedition to the Gran Nayar marked a new style of re search using philological and morphological methods for a project that sought to understand the American peoples on their own terms. From that perspective, the integral analysis of a ritual is especially significant and is based on detailed documentation, not only of texts but of every form of religious expression, such as dance, music and ritual paraphernalia. In this sense, Preuss's ethnographic collection is especially valuable for the connec tions it makes between intellectual culture and material culture, two spheres that he considered inseparable. Coras In Jesús María, following the New Year's celebration, Preuss wit nessed a mitote ritual for the first time. His transcription of ritual texts commenced later with the collaboration of Ascensión Díaz, from San Francisco, and then other singers from Jesús María: Leocadio Enríquez and Santiago Altamirano. He also was able to convince other specialists—like Matías Cánare (governor of Jesús María), Haciano Felipe and Lucio Bernabé—to tell him myths and stories. That way, he gradually won the friendship and confidence of a few informants. However, he was rejected outright by some of the singers, and on the Mesa del Nayar he was even told that the mitotes no longer existed, which was obvi ously not the case. Among the Cora Indians he witnessed important syncretic ceremonies combining local and Christian traditions, includ ing Christmas, Easter, the Changing of the Authorities ceremony, Carnival and the ceremony of the Baths. In his view, though, it was a "nominal Christianity? in which the Coras constantly strove to adapt their pagan customs to the Catholic liturgy. His notes on the different groups of dancers—the moros, the urraqueros, the maromeros and, above all, the judíos—are interesting. He collected a number of masks worn by the so-called "old men of the dance" and documented the ritual use of one of them as an oracle. "The dancers carried a wooden staff in one hand, known as palma. A miniature version of this staff, made of natu ral palm leaves, is placed in the hands of dead people. They wear a crown decorated with four bunches of long magpie feathers; children who die before the age of twelve wear the same crown. Some of the dancers had covered their faces with a beaded veil. The magpie is the bird of Mother Earth." In June 1906, the German ethnologist was invited to the planting ritual or cicada ritual at the ceremonial center of Tauta, a Cora community in San Francisco de Paula Kuaxata. Accord ing to the report he sent to the magazine Zeitschrift fiir Ethnolo gie, Preuss had gained the confidence of the locals by showing them a letter he had written attesting that "there was nothing reproachable about their customs." At the time, expressing such an opinion in writing was a sign of solidarity because just a few years earlier, the sub-prefect of Jesús María had attempted to prohibit and suppress these ceremonies. 79 Paulina Alcocer and Johannes Neurath Daniel C. Schechter.</page><page sequence="8">"I feel strong emotions when I remember those ceremonies and festive dances," wrote Preuss, "because I truly managed to penetrate the intellectual world of the Coras and their ancestors. Although the Jesus María mitote was more interesting, my best memories are from the community of San Francisco, whose in habitants treated me very kindly, even inviting me to take an ac tive part in their ceremonies." Of course, active participation implied consuming peyote, at that time a common Cora practice. In reading his report, it be comes clear that Preuss did not resist the more pleasurable effects of the psychotropic cactus. In this text, written in a slightly ironic tone, Preuss testifies to several typical effects: insomnia, height ened acoustic perception, stimulation of the imagination and a fixation on details such as spiders and other insects perishing in the fire: "The crowd jammed the small ritual patio, which was enclosed by a ring of stones. Everyone took an active part, even in the minor rituals. In the center of the patio a peyote potion was being prepared in a large gourd bowl. Everyone was served a large spoonful, using the same spoon for everyone. Actually it had the consistency of a porridge more than that of a beverage. Its consumption, often in large quantities, is one of the sacrifices a field researcher must endure. "Peyote induces sleeplessness, but I couldn't have slept any way—sitting on the uncomfortable rock they always offered me as a seat, regaling me with corn-leaf cigars, while serving me more and more peyote. All the while, behind me, the frenzied dancing and noisy rhythmic stomping of sandals continued. In the distance, there were rumbles of thunder, which are the words of the gods and are mentioned in the songs. Fortunately, we were blessed with the usual nocturnal rain. A cicada fell into the bonfire chirping its swansong without anyone becoming up set over the death of a deity. With the same indifference people watched the death by incineration of an enormous centipede that had appeared from between the peoples bare legs. For what seemed like an eternity, every detail of its luminous body was visible as it burned." The researcher from the Royal Prussian Museum of Eth nology clearly enjoyed indigenous rituals. In his opinion, they marked the most interesting days during his long stay among the Coras, the Huicholes and the Mexicaneros. In the same report, he talks of the connection between the ritual act, the songs and a myth that all refer to the rising Sun and its victory over the stars. "The boy who represents the Morn ing Star [Ha'atsikan] was taken before the altar. He shot an arrow with the bow he found there. The arrow fell on the far west side of the ritual patio. Simultaneously, one of the dancers picked up a sash that belonged to one of the traditional governors assis tants, who had deposited it in that same spot in the west. Swing ing it in the air, the dancer moved in circles around the fire a few times. Finally, he threw it toward the arches of the altar on the eastern side, where it remained. [...] The aforementioned sash represents the snake that lives in the sea of dawn. The snake is the dawn and lives in the West, as we know from Cora myth." The ritual text that corresponds to this scene explains that Ha'atsikan first kills the snake, then the falcon carries it up to the zenith, where the eagle devours it. At that moment, the snake is transformed into the "water of life," or rain. Controlled by the Sun, the water causes no further misfortunes, but rather be comes a blessing. Preuss explained that, "[The] snake that lives in the western sea [...] represents the night sky. Its darkness is conceived as water, and the Morning Star is believed to kill it ev ery day with its arrow. Next, the snake is offered to the Sun God as food. So the Morning Star transforms the snake's destructive energy into a blessing. In the same way, it makes the dew fall upon the earth. It is believed that in the past, before the Morn ing Star dominated the snake, the latter effectively destroyed the world and all humanity." Huicholes Among the Huicholes, Preuss's main interest was also to obtain textual testimonies, although he obviously took advantage of the opportunity to observe the rituals that took place during his stay. His reports contain descriptions of different ceremonies, like the ritual of the tender corn cobs; a few healing ceremonies; the ritual of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the dance of the Wainarori; the Pachitas ritual (Carnival); the peyote and toasted corn rituals, Ku ruánime, the changing of the roof on the great tuki temple, the change of leaders for the tukipa ceremonial center, the ceremony to protect against fleas and the heiwatsiire ritual. So, in different communities, he witnessed virtually the entire annual cycle of Hui chol rituals. He described the sites and the ritual paraphernalia, providing explanations of their meaning, and also explored the sacred places in the regions of San Andrés and Santa Catarina. In the peyote ritual, he noticed that "All the dancers were holding deers' tails. As in Jesús María, the two feathered sticks that many wore on their heads represented deers' antlers, while the choreographic movements of the dance imitated the attack ing thrusts of a deer's antlers. The peyoteros' costumes included hats decorated with turkey feathers and squirrel tails—both solar animals. Like their family members, the peyoteros wore the face paint of the gods. Of all the dances I watched in the sierra, none made such an impression on me as the abandoned frenzy of the peyote dance, which would begin at noon in the plaza outside the temple. Danced by men and women alike, some 175 peo ple in all would step in time to the rhythm of the singer's lusty voice. They would make turns in different directions, in absolute chaos, suddenly rushing headlong inside the temple for a few moments. Many dancers would leap wildly in the air, shaking the sugar canes painted with lightning and rain clouds with one hand, while holding the deer tails in front of them with the other. The consumption of peyote caused some of them to have a terri ble, fixed deathlike stare on their faces, but the rest of the people, sweaty and enveloped in an enormous cloud of dust lit up by the burning hot sunrays, would be shouting with joy. The sight of the dancers decked out in feathers, belts, sashes, bags and other accessories, was an extremely colorful spectacle." Animated by his understanding of this ritual, he exclaims, "How paltry is the mere aesthetic experience compared to the sensation of watching the ritual after one has also understood the intellectual forces that explain the origins of all this!" Preuss's ethnographic descriptions are not lacking in humor. He describes the ritual for protection against fleas as follows: "A boy of seven, who had been crouching before the altar hidden under a blanket, was taken outside, first to the middle of the 80</page><page sequence="9">The Sierra of Nayarit.

After each sortie he re-entered the temple, leaping on all fours, until he finally re mained outside. The grubby little tyke understood his role as a flea perfectly. He bounced his way into a crowd of women wait ing—brooms in hand—to sweep the temple after the final cer emony. The women scattered amid screams of laughter." Mexicaneros In the Mexicanero community, Preuss researched the xuravet— equivalent to the Coras' mitote—and visited the sacred caves in the vicinity. He paid special attention to healing techniques and documented practically all the prayers and xuravet songs com mon at Carnival time, as well as numerous myths and tales. He managed to prove that despite the havoc wrought by the Con quest and the changes inflicted by Spanish colonization, many of the ancient beliefs had been preserved in these cultures. But it was in the literature of this Nahua culture that he first discovered vestiges of themes from European folktales. Preuss's Collection Preuss amassed the most systematic collection of Cora and Hui chol objects ever seen. Although he never managed to write the final volume of his Die Nayarit-Expedition about the material culture and social life of these peoples, it is possible to use mu seum catalogue entries and some of his articles to reconstruct the role that the analysis of Cora and Huichol objects played in the global interpretation of the culture of these indigenous mountain dwellers. Many of the Cora and Huichol pieces at the Berlin Museum are ritual objects, which Preuss saw as forms of cultural expres sion and therefore, as having the same religious importance as the texts, songs and dances. On numerous occasions, Preuss criticized the tendency to consider any ritual object as a simple offering. Referring to ar rows, gourd bowls and other Cora and Huichol ceremonial ob jects, he insisted that they were the magical instruments of the gods. The votive arrows "cannot be considered offerings, but nei ther are they prayers. Instead, they are indispensable vehicles for obtaining life, health, rains and good harvests." The ceremonial feathered arrows are "beings in and of them selves, blessed with magical powers," the equivalent of idols. "The specific powers of the feathers depend on the color and habitat of the bird in question," and the different types of feathers cor responded to specific deities. In the ritual texts recorded by Preuss, the ritual objects par ticipated in the dialogues and cosmogonic events at the same level as zoomorphic or anthropomorphic divinities. According to the mythology, the arrows and gourd bowls originally be longed to the gods; it was they who brought them here when they left the underworld. The job of men consists of restoring 81 The Sierra of Nayarit. Photograph by Léon Diguet. © Photo SCALA, Florence.

In this sense, steps—imumui—are used by the sun to rise in the sky and reach its midday position. The disks called nierika, like the woven crosses called tsikurite, are "instruments to see," to obtain the shamanic visions that reveal the inner shape of the cosmos, although the latter are also considered "stars." According to Preuss, the etymology of the word tsikuri comes from "turning round with thread." In a Cora song he documented, the chánaka weaving, equivalent to the tsikuri, is a pre-figuration of the Earth. That text describes how the first mitote ceremony was cele brated and how the goddess of the Earth and Moon created the world. After taking her children from the depths of the primeval ocean, she assigned the clouds to them as their abode. "But now the gods started thinking: 'What are we going to do? We're tired of just hanging here.' They remembered their mother, their el der brother and their father, and called them: 'We're tired now. Do you know how you can help us?' She listened and told them: 'Look for something of yourselves.' So they did, and they began searching. They took something of themselves which was earth, and formed a small ball out of it. When they finished doing that, they called their mother, their brother and their father. To their mother they gave what they had taken from themselves. She re ceived it and wondered: 'What am I going to do with that?' Then she remembered Our Elder Brother, and told him, 'Put your ar rows there, place them crosswise, one on top of the other.' [The narrator mentions explicitly that the arrows were placed in north south and east-west directions.] That's what he did and that's how he placed his arrows. Then he tied them in the middle with a knot. When he finished, he called his mother and told her. She then thought for a moment and remembered her hair. She pulled out a lock and wove it." What the song describes is the elaboration of a diamond shaped object commonly known as a "God's eye." It is a fairly common handicraft which is nevertheless replete with religious significance because it was from a weaving of this type—manu factured with the arrows of the Elder Brother god and hair from the mother god—that the earth's surface was made. The song con tinues: "Once she had woven her hair, she took the earth and the hair, arranged them on top of the arrows and left the product for the gods. Then she said to her children: 'Stand on this.' They did so, stamping on it with their feet to stretch it out. When they had finished, they informed their mother, father and elder brother: 'Here it is, we've done as you asked.' 'Good,' replied Our Mother, 'You will remain here.' And there she left the gods. Our Mother blessed the product and called it 'world' (chánaka). With those words she completed the job. There she left the gods and every thing: stones, trees, grass, water and the god of Water [Txákan], There she left all the birds and the animals. She also left human be ings and domestic animals: cows, mules, horses, donkeys, sheep, swine, chickens and cats. Here on earth she left everything that exists in it, and she will remain in the middle, above us. Nothing is missing, and she will remain here forever. She also left behind a little something for us, her children, for one of these days." Preuss explains that, during this song, the mitote ritual be gins precisely when the mother god says, "Stand on this," and the song continues with the words, "They did so, stamping on it with their feet." By dancing, the ancestors stretched out the dia mond-shape weaving covered in earth, which is the world. That is why every mitote celebration amounts to a representation of the mythical events of creation. Manufacturing these objects im plies creating the world. On several occasions Preuss warned against overly narrow interpretations of indigenous religions. For example, "the [Cora] deities are ancestors or natural forces, but it would be impossible to classify them based on these two decidedly differentiated cat egories." In fact, consistent with Preuss's discoveries, we would have to say that in the indigenous religions he researched, a con cept of nature as an area separate from culture and society sim ply did not exist. Nature is not merely the backdrop for human life. The cosmos is not a given, nor does it exist independently of ritual work. That is why Preuss insists that offerings are not just a gift to revered beings. We can say that their elaboration and dedication is a ritual that reenacts the birth of the gods and allows them to exist. Among the offerings for the renovation of special gods, he mentions the one to Takutsi, the old goddess of unlimited fertil ity, which included maguey, jicamas, yams, and iguana and wild boar meat, along with a replica of the canoe from the great flood. Many of these items are the embodiment of the goddess herself. Preuss also describes the offering of a catfish to the goddess of corn and fish, Uteanaka—the catfish being an embodiment of this goddess. The fact that no clear distinction can be made between gods and magical instruments is crucial to the theory of religion. Preuss maintains that at the dawn of religion there can be no conception of a deity because the transition from magical ob jects to gods is necessarily a later phenomenon in the history of humanity. In the case of the Indians of the Gran Nayar, the gods are magical objects used by shamans and individuals in charge of ceremonial centers. The methodology employed by Preuss to interpret the sym bolism of the magical objects is based on philosophical medita tion on the process that the human intellect uses to form reli gious concepts and express them in texts and ritual customs, in mythology and art. Cora magical thinking shows how an indigenous religion lo cates "magic" precisely in the imaginative power of thought, in "sudden, spontaneous enlightenment" or "instant understand ing." In the final analysis, the magical action is to think and talk with poetic force. It comes as no surprise, then, that the magic of words is so important in religions like those of the Coras and Huicholes. Prayer is nothing more than spoken ritual. Words be come offerings, and people pray with objects, music and dance. So, according to Preuss's theory, the starting point for any study of intellectual culture must be to recognize the role of imaginative power, a creative ability that acts by producing syn theses that combine sensory impressions with fantastic ideas, through which the things of the world are gradually introduced to the intellect, to then insert themselves into the analogical net work that comprises the worldview and which precedes and de termines the plethora of personal ideas. In magical rituals, there is no false law of cause and effect be cause no distinction is made between the part and the whole, and 82</page><page sequence="11">therefore, rituals are not intended to be a manipulation of nature. What happens in the microcosmos of the gourd bowl or the ritual area also happens at the same instant in the macrocosmos. And thus, with his theory of magic, Preuss distanced himself from Frazer and other authors of his time (like Lumholtz), for whom the ritual was utilitarian behavior based on false knowl edge that would eventually be surpassed by human reasoning. Preuss had no trouble accepting the polysemy of ritual sym bolisms. The tsikurite are a good example, inasmuch as they represent "stars" and simultaneously the earth. The earth is also represented by the gourd bowls. Cotton is believed to be the goddess's throne of clouds while simultaneously representing the clouds that goddesses need to make rain. A gourd bowl full of cotton represents humid, fertile earth, which is why it also alludes to the female sexual organs that the gods use to create life. It might be assumed, then, that arrows are phalluses, but despite his interest in sexual symbols and phallic rites, Preuss mentions nothing in this respect. Instead, the evi dence he finds indicates that the votive arrows are the projectiles used by the gods in deer hunting. Every Cora arrow bears the symbols of the Morning Star (Haatsikan), even if it is dedicated to Mother Earth (Texkame) or to the "ancients"—the most important deceased forebears (takuate). The Morning Star is the protagonist in the cosmic struggle between the forces of light and the sidereal nocturnal monsters. The arrow is a metonymy for the Morning Star. This identification provides an argument against the inter pretation that sees votive objects as the expression of a prayer: "If we are now told that the votive arrows are like the arrows of Haatsikan, this means that they are not a means to carry prayers and offerings but rather, powerful weapons. Wouldn't it be a very strange custom to send prayers with an arrow?" Despite his reservations regarding the concepts of prayer and offering, Preuss explains that in the ritual songs he translated, it is the gods who ask for the magical objects. In our own experience, in Cora and Huichol rituals it is not easy to determine who is asking and who is giving. In the dia logistic songs, the gods speak through the shaman, who is then transformed into the people he was previously speaking to. The symbolic efficiency of the songs apparently lies precisely in the permanent change of perspective on the part of the Huichol sha man. The roles of the offering's donor and recipient become sys tematically muddled, in the same way that the roles of hunter and prey, sacrificer and sacrificial victim, become confused. In some articles, Preuss formulates a compromise between his theory of magic and the principle of reciprocity. The Huichol offer ings serve to provide the gods with the magical instruments they need for their activities, but they also express the donors' desires. Consequently, the iconography of arrows, gourd bowls, nierikate and itarite visually expresses what is being asked. Many arrows are made to ask for children's health. Details on arrows like miniature sandals, bows and bracelets refer to children. After small cloths have been rubbed against an infant's skin to rid him or her of an illness, they are tied to votive arrows. A miniature gourd contain ing tobacco is for boys who wish to become witch doctors; a par tially-woven textile for girls who want to be weavers.^ Translated by Carole Castelli. Instruments of the Gods: Select Pieces from the Preuss Collection Margarita Valdovinos and Johannes Neurath The Steps of the Gods (Huichol) On a warm day in February or March 1907, the German ethnolo gist Konrad Theodor Preuss visited the Huichol sanctuaries of Te'akata. "If only for its natural beauty, it is worthwhile visiting this area," stated the researcher in a travel chronicle he submitted to Globus magazine. "All the sanctuaries are located in a very nar row region alongside a creek that gushes over high waterfalls and runs through enormous and impressive caverns. Six temples may be glimpsed beneath some reddish rocks the size of towers." More places of worship and sacred caves could be found nearby. "The two temples devoted to the gods of birth are only accessible by de scending a vertical rockface. New mothers make a pilgrimage there five days after giving birth: they enjoy the most enviable health." He goes on: "The region of Te'akata is also the setting for some of the myths I have documented. This is where the battle between two groups of giants took place. While the losers were being annihilated, the victors were becoming the ancestors, of whom the people of Santa Catarina are so proud." And further on, "The god of fire appeared for the first time in one of the Te'akata caves, burning from the netherworld up to the heavens, whence the fire was stolen. On a strenuous day of work amidst scorching rocks, I visited and documented it all, carrying away a large booty." The pieces collected at Te'akata included a small wooden pyramid, which was an offering to Father Sun, meant to serve as steps in his ascent to the skies. The miniature is a replica of the sky which, in Mesoamerica, was not viewed as a dome but rather as a stepped pyramid. The sun ascends into the sky by climbing one side, and descends the other side. "When the sun is at the zenith, it has reached the highest point in its journey." Ritual texts that Preuss transcribed in indigenous tongues provide evidence for this interpretation: "The songs clearly ex press that the lofty heights of heaven figure among the regions where the gods carry out their activities. This is why they mention that the gods ask for steps (imumui) to ascend to and descend from heaven." This document further states that, "I felt like I was dreaming when among the 'savages' I was able to meet individu als whose sensitivity to nature was so highly developed and af fectionate. In comparison, even the Greek world came up short in my view, because the origins of their religious ideas can no lon ger be reconstructed, and their tales about the souls of trees and plants represent only insignificant vestiges of what once existed." The miniature pyramid constitutes a good example for the appreciation of the methodology Preuss used in his study of in digenous civilizations, both modern and ancient. "There is no doubt that among ancient Mexicans, the stepped pyramids with places of worship at their peaks were also representations of the gods' abodes in the celestial heights," Preuss explained in a lec ture on the Mexican astral religion. A simple Huichol offering is the key to revealing the secrets of pre-Hispanic ceremonial architecture. J.N. 83 Margarita Valdovinos and Johannes Neurath Carole Castelli.</page><page sequence="12">The Sacred Bundles of the God of Children (Huichol) Preuss left us some crucial testimony as to the Huicholes' rela tionship with the dead and with deified ancestors: "They feel a great need to have the dead with them, to keep many deities present. [...] In small temples, one often only finds a small chair for the god. They have some fairly simple sculptures made out of stone or wood to represent the gods. In a place of worship near the Santa Bárbara church, every altar held a large bundle of cloth and weaving, each with a stone inside. Surrounded by of ferings of votive arrows, feathers, seeds, ribbons bearing beauti ful designs and other woven textiles, these bundles could only be opened once the rainy season had ended, given that the objects had been arranged in a very specific way in order to bring good harvests. I was able to bring the largest bundle back with me: the fire god Tatutsi Uistewari, seated on an equipal and quite similar to a Peruvian mummy." Another interesting aspect of these bundles with stone sculp tures at the center is that they bear a striking resemblance to the mummies of the Cora kings as described in colonial chronicles. According to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century sources, these were actual human bodies wrapped in fabric and seated on equí pales (chairs of authority), which were worshipped in temples or caves. Similar practices existed among the Huicholes. A chronicle by Father Arlegui dating to 1851 quotes a report describing the destruction of a Huichol ceremonial center located on the outskirts of the town of Tenzompan: "Being Father Miguel Diaz the guardian of this convent [of Tenzompa], he received news that in Tenzompla—two leagues away from the town—there were certain little straw huts in the most hidden part of the mountains. They were full of many shields, arrows and pots, and apparently no one lived in them. [...] The largest hut had a small basket at the door, and standing on it there was a waxen figure, a span high, rep resenting a very ugly black man, with his hands held in such a way that he appeared to be guarding the door. Inside this same house, there was a chair or equipal at the front, and seated on it there was a figure with the following form: it was a dead body that was not missing a single bone, oddly wrapped in woolen cloths adorned with brightly colored feathers, the bones somehow joined together, so that only the flesh and nerves were missing, and they were tied together with cane. In the other houses, there were shields, pots and many glass beads." f.N. The Mask of the Oracle (Cora) Cora masks for the old men in the Dance of the Urraqueros are especially powerful objects. For instance, Preuss had no prob lems acquiring the sacred Huichol bundles that are considered to be the ancestors, but he never managed to collect any original examples of masks for the Old Man of the dance. Preuss described his experience with the San Francisco Kua xata mask as follows: "The mask worn by the leader of the dance is especially interesting. It was carved about twenty years ago, and it is so sacred that it was impossible to procure, so I had to settle for an exact copy. The original was made by the key el ders after fasting for ten days, meaning that they ate only once a day, and abstained from salt, and also that they drank water only once a day. All the elders dreamed the same dream when they slept, and that was that they must make a mask that depicted a specific person. That is why the mask is a portrait. After mak ing the mask, they fasted ten more days, and only then did they start using it. The mask itself is a powerful god, and the people worship it. When the rains are scarce, the people gather at town hall and fast for five to twenty days. During this time, the mask is placed on the floor. [...] Its long hair made from maguey fi bers is stretched out like a coat, and to bring the rain, an offer ing is made of paper and cotton flowers that represent clouds. [...] When the mask is angry, it refuses to send rain, and does not want to protect people from misfortune. By communicat ing through its white, black or red paint, it appears in peoples dreams and shows them what they need to do. When it speaks with white paint, the problem that needs to be addressed is ill ness. White is a kind of protective barricade, but illnesses can get through it and affect the population. Black is a reference to night and clouds, and its significance is that the mask commands the celebration of a nocturnal mitote ceremony in the mountains. [...] When the mask communicates through the color red, it is asking that people pray to the Sun, that the entire population recite prayers to the Sun. Red also represents the lightning bolt against which the mask can offer protection." J.N. The Yáwime Gourd Bowl (Cora) The Preuss collection includes two of the most interesting Cora ritual objects in existence, which are still in common use: the yáwime gourd bowl and the chánaka weaving. Both pieces are considered to be representations of the world. However, given that they appear in different ceremonial con texts, a comparative analysis of their ritual use allows us to move past their iconographic characteristics and see how such objects are known for their great dynamism: like their design, their use is an indispensable element in our understanding of the repre sentations that such objects contribute to ritual activities. The interior of the yáwime gourd bowl features a design in colored beads, parrot feathers and cotton fibers held in place with beeswax. The composition of these elements provides a glimpse of the worlds structure. Preuss sees in this design an analogy with the distribution of the ritual space where the gourd is used: four points indicating the cardinal directions, with a vertical axis emerging from the center, indicating up and down. In the agricultural rituals known as mitotes, these bowls are placed on an altar located on the east side of a circular patio. The patio, the altar and the bowl are all seen as maps of the world. A white handkerchief is placed on the inside of the yáwime bowl, and several small floral bouquets are arranged on top of it in the form of a cross. These bouquets were provided by each of the partici pants in the ritual, so the arrangement represents the members of the group and the world at the same time. This bundle is called téih kame and constitutes the central object of worship in the mitotes. During the ritual, the gourd bowl acts as a container of men and corn. This is why it is identified with the abode of Húrimua, the goddess and creator of life. In its condition of recipient, of uterus, the yáwime bowl provides human life and corn, but above all, it creates an analogy between these elements, and al lows people to understand their own existence in relation with the lifecycle of the grain. 84</page><page sequence="13">The Chánaka Weaving (Cora) The weaving known as chánaka (which literally means "world") consists of a circular structure made up of slender reed stems interlaced with colored yarn. The design represents the territory where humans live and within which they travel throughout their lives. A circle in the center represents Tuákamu'uta, a mountain that is considered the center of Cora territory and of the world. Several triangles project from it, each one corresponding to a mountain or a particular place, while their different colors at test to the varied landscape and kinds of soil there are on Earth. They correspond to places that the weavers have known all their lives. Because of that, their woven interpretation is always differ ent. Today, for example, it is said to include certain cities in the United States where large groups of Cora now live. The weaving is done by the members of the Council of Elders. It is elaborated during the five days of fasting following the ritual held at the end of each year during which the traditional respon sibilities are allocated. When the ritual is over, the weaving is taken to Tuákamu'uta and placed in a cave as an offering to Our Father Tayau, identified with the image of the Holy Sepulcher and the Sun. This object is the central piece in a group of of ferings, consisting of arrows (tabehri) that are placed before the gods of the directions (tyahkuatye) who inhabit the mountains and hills around the community. The ritual uses of these two objects show us the different conceptions of the world and the diverse ways in which its in habitants relate to it. In the way the gourd bowl is used, we can observe a process of concentration in which the different com ponents of the world are represented through its unity. This cen tripetal conception may be seen in the design inside the gourd bowl, where in a single image of the world we can see its differ ent regions, though what predominates is the overall image. A similar process takes place in the distribution of the contents of the gourd: the placement of the bouquets contributed by each of the participants indicates that they all form part of a single group and that it is only as members of this group that they are able to establish ties with corn. The action that takes place dur ing the mitote ceremony refers to the relationship between the ceremonial group and the corn, making it the starting point for the conception of human life. The case of the chánaka weaving is different, because more important than its ritual use is its elaboration—always so innova tive—and the fate that awaits it: after this offering is placed, it is abandoned. Moreover, the fact that it occupies the central spot in the arrangement of offerings next to the ritual patio highlights the existence of a centrifugal process where the objective is to frag ment the representation of the world's unity. This process comes into play in the chánaka weaving's design, which is intended to illustrate the diversity of the world and the different experiences of its inhabitants. In a similar fashion, the ritual during which this object is created alludes to the dispersion of the offerings, so that the central object takes on its full meaning in the context of all the other offerings which are placed as part of the same ritual process in Tuákamu'uta, and throughout the Cora territory. Other aspects of the ritual use of these two objects are equally divergent. While the same gourd bowl is preserved and passed down from generation to generation—such continuity being presented as analogous to the relationship between humans and corn—the chánaka is an object made to be offered and then for gotten, given that a year later, a new one will be made and offered in its place. Its ephemeral presence refers to the changes that the landscape undergoes with the changing seasons. The dynamic conception of the world expressed in these two objects provides a glimpse of two facets of the relationship be tween the Coras and the world they live in. In the case of the gourd bowl, the world is conceived as an agent with an active role, because it gives humanity life through corn. In the case of the woven cloth, the world appears as a "passive agent," given that it is man, through his experience, who creates links between himself and the territory he moves through in his lifetime. The Crown of Feathers (Cora) Every Cora community that celebrates the mitote ceremony pos sesses certain prized items, including at least one crown of parrot feathers. This object is always beautifully preserved by its custo dians. The great care that goes into this task is due not only to the region's dwindling parrot population—making the elabora tion of new crowns very difficult—but also to the valuable role the crown plays: passed down from generation to generation, the parrot-feather crowns help to interconnect the representations of the gods, deer, corn and man. During the mitotes, two individuals are seen wearing such a crown. The first is a boy who represents Ha'atsikan, the Cora cultural hero, and the second is a young man who personifies the deer. They appear at different moments of the ritual, danc ing around the central fire among the other participants. Their feather crowns, hidden beneath a bandanna, also hold a bunch of feathered sticks on either side of their faces to simulate a deer's antlers. The boy Ha'atsikan appears at different moments at the center of the ritual action. He is usually accompanied by a girl dressed in white and covered with flowers made from colored ribbons. She represents Tatyi, Our Mother Corn. Together, they move to ward the different cardinal directions to visit the spirits at each point in the world. The youth—who is given the role of Nari—is responsible for feeding the central fire and personifying the deer in some of the dances. It is at this moment that he wears the par rot-feather crown. Both participants have many other things in common be sides their costumes. They form part of a single hierarchy of ritual positions, given that the young man chosen to represent Nari must have played the role of Ha'atsikan in his childhood. Similarly, during the ritual, the two characters facilitate the ap pearance of a new character who, though unseen—as he only ap pears through descriptions of him in the songs—shares certain characteristics with them: it is Tahá, Our Older Brother. This de ity, identified with Saint Michael the Archangel, is considered to be a true cultural hero among the Cora Indians, as he is also the deer's older brother. The crown of parrot feathers is an element that evokes dif ferent aspects of whoever wears it. In the case of the child, the crown shows us that he is the guardian of the corn. When it is worn by the young Nari, the crown identifies him as a particular deer made from corn by Teih, Our Mother Corn. 85</page><page sequence="14">One final use of the parrot-feather crown may help us to clarify its meaning. Another crown, identical to the one worn by the two aforementioned participants, is placed around a gourd bowl containing a large cotton boll. Set at the center of the altar during the mitotes and at the ceremonies marking the change of season (held in February, May, August and November), this gourd contains the offerings of cotton left over the years by dif ferent residential groups that have participated in the ritual. The crown of green feathers that surrounds it indicates that everyone represented inside the recipient is closely linked to corn, which is the main object of worship in these ceremonies. It also shows the ritual's participants that whoever wears the crown of feath ers—Haatsikan, the deer and Tahá—remains in the world to take care of them. The parrot feathers with their characteristic bright green color represent corn tassels. M. V. Huichol, Cora and MexicaneroTextiles Preuss's collection of textiles is surprising in its diversity and com pleteness. The clothing, game bags, ribbons, belts and nets that the ethnologist acquired during his expedition through the Nayarit Sierra are notable for the variety of designs, techniques and mate rials. The diversity of pieces and styles is quite revealing in terms of certain aspects of the use and manufacture of these objects. The collection of Huichol ribbons, bands and sashes is ex traordinarily beautiful. Consisting of about a hundred pieces, it features a varied graphic vocabulary that is notable for its color combinations, original designs and the perfection of the tech niques used. While these kinds of objects continue to be pro duced and used today, modern examples rarely display the same degree of complexity as the pieces collected by Preuss, where the smallest details and intricate designs evidence the diversity of their use and central role in Huichol culture. There are many examples of game bags woven on the back strap loom, allowing us to identify certain distinguishing charac teristics of Huichol and Cora textiles. Huichol pieces are woven from one end of the loom to the other, so when the textile is folded in half to form the bag, the central design is divided in two. Cora game bags are woven from both ends of the backstrap loom, allowing the weaver to create a different design for each side of the bag and to finish the weaving at the center—corre sponding to the bags base—with a simpler, more open stitch. Mexicanero bags made from natural fibers display a diversity of weaving styles and forms: square, round and extendible. The different techniques used to decorate Cora bags allow us to track the evolution of their designs. The first group of tex tiles, woven or embroidered, contains simple geometric designs that are repeated to create different "textures"—a bird's wings, a corncob, natural fibers, and so forth. A second group features more elaborate designs with geometric forms that are combined and organized in order to create certain images: flowers, animal silhouettes, birds, tools, plants and so forth. A final group, made up mainly of embroidered pieces, is characterized by the use of more elaborate images of flowers, plants and animals in which symmetry is not the rule, as it is the unique details and variations that predominate. The textiles in the Preuss collection offer one further surprise: just as they provide us with a glimpse of the textile universe from nearly a century ago, they also reveal certain facets of the person that collected them. The inclusion of antique and sometimes in complete textiles reveals the ethnologist's interest in understand ing how they were used. This interest is particularly evident in one particular type of object in his collection: the samplers. In fact, a large number of the textile pieces appear to fulfill this function, given that rather than presenting a finished design done in a particular technique, they seem to be a collage of dif ferent stitches, color combinations and decorative techniques. In this sense, Preuss's samplers bear witness to his tireless quest to understand the daily life of indigenous cultures. M. V.O Translated by Michelle Suderman. UNFINISHED DETERMINATION The End of an Ethnological Adventure Johannes Neurath In February 1908, Preuss began to arrange for funds to publish the results of his expedition. At that time, he was planning an opus in five volumes: 1. Cora texts, 2. Huichol texts, 3. Mexi canero texts, 4. Grammars and vocabularies, 5. An account of his journey and a description of intellectual and material culture (religion, art and sociology, and so forth) in context, taking into account parallels with the ancient Mexican culture. In 1912, the first of the books about his Mexican research was published in Leipzig, with the title Die Nayarit-Expedition: Textaufnahmen und Beobachtungen unter mexikahischen Indi anern 1. Die Religion der Cora-Indianer in Texten nebst Wórter buch Cora-Deutsch (Expedition to Nayarit: Records of Texts and Observations about Mexican Indians. I. The Coras' Religion through Their Texts, with a Cora-German Dictionary). In the introduction he points out characteristics of the Cora religion. Based on the philological analysis of the words to songs from the mitote ceremony, he presents a systematic compari son with the religion of the ancient Mexicans. In his study of the Cora religion he starts with the importance of the night sky and the contrast between light and dark, to then move on to an analysis of the main divinities: Tayau, the Sun; Tatéx, the Earth and the Moon; Ha'atsikan, the Morning Star, and Sáutari, the Evening Star. He then presents 147 texts including myths and songs, with their corresponding interlineal word-for-word German transla tion, followed by a freer translation. At the end he includes a Cora-German vocabulary, so that the texts are more comprehen sible for the reader. His wife Margarethe was in charge of cor recting the galleys and compiling the index. The book met with positive reviews all over the world. How ever, a series of unfortunate circumstances prevented a complete publication including all the material obtained in Mexico. Journey to Colombia In September 1913, Preuss interrupted the publication of materials from his expedition to Nayarit to embark on a new research voyage, 86 Michelle Suderman. Johannes Neurath</page><page sequence="15">this time to Colombia. This decision may seem surprising, consid ering that he had only completed one fifth of his editorial project. After the first volume of Die Nayarit-Expedition was pub lished, Preuss was at the height of his celebrity. German col leagues and others around the world unanimously showered him with accolades. But his relationship with the other Meso americanists of Berlin—Eduard Seler and Walter Lehmann— was worse than ever. Preuss had long been having serious differ ences with Seler, his superior. Seler argued that Preuss's theories were too speculative. Preuss, the theorist, defended the need for a global interpretation of the Mexican religion. With first-hand ethnographic studies, Preuss managed to impress his colleagues by presenting an important theoretical, and at the same time empirical, work. Sidelined from Mesoamericanist projects directed by Seler, Preuss did not attend the International Americanists Congress of 1910, held in Mexico City, nor was he involved in the Interna tional School of American Ethnology and Archaeology founded in the Mexican capital that same year. Díaz de Arce mentions a curriculum vitae in which Preuss states that the intention of his journey to Colombia was to broaden his horizons, although it was quite obvious he was also searching for a "study field far away from director Seler." Preuss's main objective in Colombia was to visit the region of the ancient culture around San Agustín, at the source of the Mag dalena River. It was one of the most famous archaeological group ings in South America because of its many gigantic stone statues, standing up to four meters tall. From December 1913 to March 1914 he carefully explored that region, drawing maps, excavating and describing sites, amassing archaeological collections, making molds of the statues and photographing them. Preuss's work is a landmark in the history of Colombian archaeology, inasmuch as it was the first systematic study of the country's most famous pre-Hispanic monuments. It interesting to note that in Colombia, Preuss became involved in something he had never wanted to do in Mexico: terrain archaeology. On completing his work in San Agustín, Preuss moved to the wild region southeast of Florencia. In hopes of discovering clues in the beliefs and rituals of the living indigenous population that would allow him to interpret the San Agustín monuments, he traveled to the Uitoto Indian community that had settled on the banks of a tributary of the Orteguaza River. In July 1914 he went back up into the hills to begin new ex cavations on the other side of the central cordillera. Political disturbances in Ecuador prevented him from reaching the area from southern Colombia. So during August and September he conducted archaeological digs in the Patia river valley, which he was forced to suspend when his financing was cut after the out break of World War I. Although he found it very difficult to concentrate on his re search projects under these circumstances, in November 1914 he set sail for Riohacha. He then traveled by canoe as far as Dibulla, a village of blacks and mulattos, and from there to the first Kogui town of San Miguel, where he returned to his far less costly eth nographic research. The Koguis, a Chibcha group also known as the Kágaba, was perhaps the most unapproachable of all the cultures he had studied. In April 1915, at the conclusion of his fieldwork, interna tional political events stranded him in Colombia indefinitely. Although Colombian authorities would not allow him leave the country, they agreed to let him continue his research. He settled in La Esperanza, along the railway between Girardot and Bogotá. Now his plan was to use the time to prepare works for publica tion about the Uitotos, the Koguis and San Agustín. He went so far as to claim that all his notes "would give him enough work for the rest of his life." After receiving proposals from certain Co lombian intellectuals to undertake other research in the country, he wrote something that could well become a motto for anthro pologists everywhere: "It is satisfying to be able to finish a job and begin another, more promising one [but] what use is it for a researcher to explore a series of cultures, one after the other, if he runs the risk of not being able to publish the most essential part of his work in his lifetime?" Finally, on October 7, 1919, he returned to Berlin. He im mediately began looking for publishers for his books about Co lombia, but in that era of crisis and inflation it was no easy matter to get three voluminous books published. So the whole process dragged on for a decade. In the early years after World War I, German anthropology not only suffered the consequences of the loss of colonies: many foundations that had previously financed scientific expeditions and publications had gone bankrupt under the pressure of unending economic crises. Preuss's Death There are still many questions surrounding the death of Preuss. We know that under the Nazi regime Preuss refused to renounce his independent spirit and was betrayed by an old colleague, a scheming opportunist. In contrast with the liberalism that had characterized the founders of German anthropology, in the 1930s many represen tatives of this science were racists or even declared anti-Semitics. Preuss wasn't, and because of that, he openly distanced himself from Nazi ideology. In 1934, in the context of the Nazifying poli tics of cultural institutions, both Preuss, who was then 64, and W. Lehmann, 55, lost their jobs at the museum. In Lehmann's case it was more obvious that he had been forced into premature retirement, though it was officially explained as an "administra tive simplification." It was in this inauspicious atmosphere that Preuss resumed publishing the Huichol texts. Beginning in 1934, he received a modest annual sum from Franz Boas of the University of Colom bia, who suggested that Preuss publish the Gran Nayar materials in the United States. At the same time, Preuss and his exiled disciple Mengin completed the first edition of the Toltec-Chichimec his tory, published as a supplement to the magazine Baessler-Archiv. The ethnology handbook, Lehrbuch der Volkerkunde—origi nally the idea of Leonhard Adam—was published in 1937. After Adam emigrated, Preuss took over the coordination of the book, for which he had been commissioned to write articles about literature and religion, as well as a "Guide to Ethnological Re cordkeeping in the Field." Defying Nazi censorship, he included Leonhard Adam's articles about legal anthropology and the use of questionnaires, as well as pieces defending functionalism by Richard Thurnwald and Wilhelm Miihlmann. This tendency was 87</page><page sequence="16">repudiated by the regime, mainly due to certain anti-Nazi decla rations by the most famous functionalist anthropologist, Broni slaw Malinowski. Seizing Preuss's selection of material as a political opportu nity, Krickeberg wrote a review of the Lehrbuch for Zeitschrift für Ethnologie. According to the Austrian journalist Egon Edwin Kisch, the review read more like a "formal accusation to the po lice, done in a medium that was no longer viewed as out of the ordinary in Nazi circles—the pages of a scientific journal. The recriminatory reviewer [...] informed the Gestapo that the emi nent Mexicanist did not respect the national socialist ideology because he did not profess 'the historicist idea of ethnology' [...] and 'frequently and respectfully quotes the functionalists.'" In the final paragraph of his text, Krickeberg wrote that, "It is inconceivable that Preuss's book includes two contributions from a non-Aryan ethnologist [L. Adam], and grants preference to an ethnological school [the functionalist school] whose leader [B. Malinowski] has become a declared adversary of today's na tionalist-socialist Germany by adopting precisely this academic viewpoint," The editor of Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie, jointly responsible for this publication, was the Africanist and avowed Nazi Hermann Baumann. In the next issue of Zeitschrift, Krickeberg continued his attacks. He ably painted Preuss as an orthodox functionalist, and functionalism as a scientific tendency "with a Jewish ori entation." In particular, he accused Preuss of not condemning Malinowski's anti-Nazism enough, again arguing that the latters political position should be understood to be a direct conse quence of his scientific stance. He thought it was not enough that Preuss had limited himself to commenting that Malinowski "has a strangely tense relationship with current nationalist trends." On June 8, 1938—shortly after these accusations were di vulged—Preuss died. Official documents show the cause of death to be a heart attack. According to Kisch, it would not have been surprising that fear of a possible arrest by the Gestapo, mixed with his indignation over the "despicable and cowardly act by an old pupil and colleague," had caused the health of the still young Preuss to deteriorate. Moreover, "the possibility that he was assassinated with a blow to the heart has certainly not been eliminated." In 1947, when the German magazine Weltbiihne publicly accused Krickeberg of provoking Preuss's death, he vigorously denied it. The Berlin anthropologist Norbert Díaz de Arce re cently submitted the whole matter to a fairly meticulous review, when it was concluded that although Kisch's report contains a certain lack of precision, it could indeed be affirmed that Kricke berg was a declared Nazi who plotted against colleagues. Possibly Preuss's death was not caused by Krickeberg's review but by a let ter signed by Baumann informing Preuss that at a meeting which the Americanist had been unable to attend, he had been stricken from the list of eligible candidates for presidency of the German Anthropological Society. The reason? An equally negative review of the Lehrbuch—written by an assistant of Professor Plischke's named Senge and published in a Góttingen newspaper—had also stated that it was scandalous to have included contributions from racially impure authors. This information comes from testimony written by Hans Nev ermann, dated 1947, intended to defend Krickeberg, so it is not a highly reliable source either. As Nevermann puts it, it was Preuss's widow who had confided the details of her husband's death. We shall probably never know for sure what happened. According to Nevermann's testimony, it was Baumann who insisted Krickeberg add the aforementioned final paragraph to his review. The Posthumous Publication ofMexicanero Texts In 1938 Preuss already had the Huichol texts ready for publica tion, and there was a plan in place for the German Science Emer gency Association to finance the publication. However, during an air strike in Leipzig the original manuscript was burned at the B. G. Teubner publishing house. Then in 1944, during bombing raids on Berlin, the building where Preuss had had his apart ment was destroyed and along with it his photographic records, as well as the only carbon copy of the book and all field notes on the Huicholes. Not only that, in the Hamburg bombings most of Preuss's collection that had remained in the city museum there was destroyed. Only a few objects and catalogue cards prepared by Preuss survived. Fortunately, most of the cylinders with musical record ings were not affected. After the war they were taken to Lenin grad, to later be returned to East Berlin. The irreversible destruc tion of the Huichol materials was a terrible loss for anthropology and universal literature. In search of unpublished work by Preuss, Gerdt Kutscher accidentally came across a note in a publication for German booksellers that one Mr. Preuss of the city of Treysa had won a literature prize. When he contacted him, he turned out to be the anthropologist's grandson who told him that he had visited his grandfather's apartment on January 3, 1944—shortly before its destruction—and had taken some notebooks as a souvenir. When Kutscher received them in 1958, he saw they included three of Preuss's five field notebooks containing Mexicanero materials, a notebook of Cora texts and three notebooks with Colombian materials. Elsa Ziehm—ethnomusicologist, special ist in oral literature and scholar of classical Náhuatl—agreed to prepare those texts for publication. And the Iberoamerican In stitute of Berlin posthumously published Nahua-texte aus San Pedro Jicora, Durango (Nahua Texts of San Pedro Jicara, Duran go), in three volumes. In John Bierhost's view, despite the losses, the work published by Ziehm "constitutes the richest collection of mythology, songs and prayers in Náhuatl since the work of the great Franciscan monk, Bernardino de Sahagún."0 Translated by Carole Castelli. 88 Carole Castelli.</page></plain_text>
