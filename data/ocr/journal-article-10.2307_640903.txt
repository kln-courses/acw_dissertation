<plain_text><page sequence="1">EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT A Study of 'The Bacchae' By L. M. MEAD T HE Bacchae is acknowledged to be the most difficult to interpret of all Euripides' plays, and the difficulty of un- derstanding it is increased by the fact that it is in many ways unlike his other works. The human characters are not so clearly drawn, nor are they of such heroic calibre. The mani- festation of Dionysus' power and the adoration of him at the end are, moreover, in contrast to Euripides' usual 'sceptical' tone. No interpretation of the play is satisfactory which does not show Dionysus as a real power (although such have been attempted), but, when this has been granted, the question still remains, 'What kind of power?' To say that Euripides was acknowledging the god worshipped in the Dionysiac cult is not enough. Euripides' outlook is too philosophic to admit of so simple an explanation. Nor is it enough to say that Dionysus, while a real power, is also an evil one-a verdict which Euripides' 'enthusiasm for humanity' makes decidedly attrac- tive, in spite of the beauty of some of the choruses and the fact that Pentheus does not share the moral victory of Hippolytus, Hecuba, Jocasta, Iphigenia, and other victims of divine ven- geance, who are greater than their fate. We are on our way to a clearer understanding of the problem if we dissociate from the word 8E65 many of the ideas which Christian and Jewish tradition alike have associated with the word 'God'. The Greek eGoi were for the most part powers of nature-whether external nature or human passions. Two passages from other plays of Euripides worthy of note in this connexion are the opening speech of the Hippolytus and Hecuba's explanation of the name 'Aphrodite' in the Troades (989 and 99o). The Dionysus who is revealed to us in the Bacchae is the god of the wild things, both of nature in its wildest aspects and of uncontrolled human passions. His con- nexion with the vine is more than a chance connexion of</page><page sequence="2">EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT 23 a vegetation god with the most important cultivated tree in the districts which were centres of his cult. The phenomenon of alcoholic intoxication is of definite significance, for in it voli- tional control of action is removed and repressed tendencies have free range. If this is anything like an accurate explanation of Dionysus, the significance of Pentheus is not difficult to understand. The natural enemy of worship of a Dionysiac kind is Puritanism, and Pentheus' objections to Dionysiac worship are of a puri- tanical type. The evils he fears in the State are effeminacy and sexual irregularity, and he is ready to suspect tendencies to- wards these in every innovation. That there was a Puritan movement in Greece is well known. It was, moreover, a movement which had its stronghold among the intellectuals. It found its greatest exponent in Euripides' younger contemporary, the philosopher Plato, but it did not start with him. The Puritan protest against the popular mytho- logy had found able exponents before Euripides' day in Xenophanes and Heraclitus, and there was distinct sympathy with it in the philosophic schools. It would be a mistake, how- ever, to imagine that the Bacchae was merely a stage in the age-long conflict between the poets and the Puritans. Poet though Euripides was, the nature of his attack on the popular mythology shows that he had definite sympathy with the aims and ideals of the Puritan movement. This is perhaps not sur- prising, for the true Puritan, unlike the picture of him given by flippant writers, is not necessarily a vandal, but an artist who aims at beauty of a high order and will not tolerate anything which threatens to endanger that beauty. There is grim irony in the fact that, while Euripides' ideals seem to have been so like his own, Plato in his attack on the poets cites especially from Euripides' plays instances of unworthy and harmful representations of the gods. It is, however, a striking example of the importance of method and the difficulty of securing co- operation between people working for the same ends, if they do not approve of the same means. While Euripides sought to portray things as they were and did not shrink from showing an evil cult in all its hideousness, Plato, in true puritanic style,</page><page sequence="3">24 EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT feared lest any portrayal of evil, even as an exposure, should merely encourage unhealthy gloating. In the Bacchae Euripides, as it ivere, steps out of the fray and reviews the tactics of both sides. For a brief time he has ceased to fight the battle of the Puritans against the traditional mytho- logy and gives a picture of the conflict, the issues involved, the relative strength of both parties, and the methods they employ. The first point to be examined in studying the Bacchae is Euripides' portrait of Dionysus, and at the outset it should be noted that, however much Euripides may sympathize with the Puritans, he is too great a poet and a realist to fail to see that, though it may lure to something hideous, the Sirens' Song is itself a thing of beauty. His Dionysus is a dazzling figure. Throughout the prologue, which he himself speaks, he gives the impression of power and splendour. The working out of the play confirms this impression. Dionysus' power is its central feature. That he is fair to look upon is noted by his captors and even by his arch-enemy, Pentheus. The Chorus sing his praises in the rapt tones of those who have but recently entered into a world of beauty. Beauty and joy are, indeed, the keynotes of the earlier choruses. The women of the Chorus are keenly alive to the beauties of external nature. The god whom they worship is intimately connected with these beauties. He is, moreover, as Teiresias maintains, the giver of rest and sleep, the lord of music, poetry, and the dance. He is a civilizing force and- strange claim, in view of the working out of the play!-the bringer of peace. It is in the emotional life that music, poetry, and the dance have their origin and, however great a part is played by the intellect in their development, these activities lack life and sincerity unless the emotions find expression in them. A very large measure too of the ecstasy experienced by the Chorus is due to the relief that results from liberation from taboo. The moral claims of the worshippers of Dionysus, although repeatedly stated, crumble somewhat under a close examination. The modern reader, accustomed through Christian and Jewish tradition to associate ethical attributes with the word 'holiness', is apt to attach an ethical significance to the references to 'Otia,</page><page sequence="4">EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT 25 but originally 'holiness' merely meant 'devotion to a god' and its ethical significance depended entirely on the character of the god with whom it was associated. Perhaps the clearest opinion expressed as to the morality or immorality of Dionysus is in lines 314-18: o0X 6 At6wvoos coppovEiv avayKa:Et The emotional life is per se neither good nor bad. What it is in any individual depends on that individual's i8oos. But to say that the emotional life is itself morally neutral is not to say the same of the worship of Dionysus, the mere pur- suit of emotional excitement. The Chorus and the aged con- verts to Dionysiac worship, Teiresias and Cadmus, state that it is as old as time and condemn the speculations of those who would pursue a coqia above the reach of the majority of man- kind. Passages in which such views are expressed are attractive to those who would see in the Bacchae a palinode to the scepti- cism of Euripides' earlier works, and it is easy to trace a con- nexion between the aoqia here condemned and Oppis. On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that the fear of com- mitting O'ppis loomed less largely in Euripides' mind than in the minds of earlier poets and that many of the most sceptical utterances in his earlier plays were put into the mouths of people of strong humanity and heroic calibre. While no one can say that it would have been impossible for Euripides to change from such an attitude of lofty speculation to a mere 'herd morality', the likelihood of his having done so must not be decided solely by the tone of certain passages condemning co(pia. Moreover, such recantations are generally made in moments of exhaustion, and, gloomy though the Bacchae may be in subject, it is too vigorous a play to be the work of an exhausted man. In order to obtain a true idea of the moral tone of Dionysiac worship, it is necessary to examine closely the actual rites and the things in which the Bacchante delights. Such an examination reveals a definite clash with the main current of Greek ideals.</page><page sequence="5">26 EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT The Greeks were humanists and, in spite of the cynicism be- trayed by the sophist's dictum, 'Man is the measure of all things', their humanism represented something noble and ex- alted. The anthropomorphic picture of the gods which Homer painted, although inferior to the highest conceptions, both philosophic and ethical, of the fifth century, marked in its own day an advance on primitive and often bestial conceptions. To those who followed the Homeric tradition humanity was closely connected with acoqpooaivr~, with restraint and orderliness. The intense interest in the animal creation and sympathy for it, felt by so many people at the present day, obscure for a modern reader the significance of the scene in which the Bacchic women fondle the animals on the hills. The next scene, in which they rend the cattle, shows how far removed the Bacchic attitude was from the tenderness to which a modern might be inclined to attribute their earlier actions. In the very fondling too there are indications that all is not well. The women who sport with the animals on the hills have deserted their own children, have left them untended, while they suckle the young of fawns and wolves. The fact is that Dionysiac worship is sub-human. Dionysus himself is not a wholly anthropomorphic god, like those with whom Homer peopled Olympus. He is TaCup6KEpCO5 (1. o00). Pentheus in the infatuated condition in which he goes to his death sees him as a bull, and it is in that form or as a many-headed snake or a fire-breathing lion that the Chorus implore him to appear to take vengeance. He repre- sents the animal in man demanding expression at the expense of all else. There is no meanness to which he will not stoop to gain his own ends. Treachery and deceit play a greater part than strength in the overthrow of Pentheus and, provided such methods bring success, all is well in the eyes of his worshippers.

(877-81)' I The context points to KcaTrXCa having here the sense merely of holding, not of restraint.</page><page sequence="6">EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT 27 When driven to extremes the cult is sheer brutality and violates human affection, a thing more beautiful than the wild beauty in which it exults. Pentheus is neither a tyrant nor a martyr, but a man who attempts the impossible, who tries with merely human strength to overthrow a power of nature. The Chorus, when threatened with imprisonment and when the supposed priest is actually imprisoned, accuse him of tyranny. The portrait of him given in the play hardly justifies us, however, in endorsing this verdict. He may be quick-tempered and hasty (1. 670), but there is no suggestion that his rule had been oppressive before the events recorded in the play-and, whatever judgement we may pass on his attack on the Dionysiac religion, the fact remains that his motive in attacking it was good: he thought it was destructive of the morals of the people and, therefore, contrary to the highest interests of the state. The portrait we have of him is of a conscientious young man who takes his duties as a ruler very seriously. The limits of the story do not allow us to see him in a very attractive light, but Cadmus in his lament over him records that he was a model of filial piety and courtesy to his elders-virtues which were highly prized in the ancient world. His own opposition to Dionysus brings him into conflict with the two old men, Cadmus and Teiresias, but his attitude to them is mainly one of grief and horror at finding them engaged in pursuits which he feels are degrading. His affection for Cadmus is obvious. His harshness to Teiresias may well be due to a desire to affix the blame for a disgraceful escapade to some- one other than his grandfather. The words of Cadmus' lament over him suggest a man who in his private life, at least, was lovable. C) 0ip-rc-X' aV2pcV,, Kai yap OUKET' G)V OCOS TrcAv plprx'Trcov 4Oly ape0IJChYE1 TKrKVCV. (I317-I8) As regards Pentheus' harshness it should be noted that it is accompanied by signs of excitement and panic. As opposition increases, so he becomes more violent in his attempts to over- throw the Dionysiac religion. When part of the palace is destroyed by earthquake and the prisoner miraculously re- leased, far from recognizing that he is opposing a power more</page><page sequence="7">28 EURIPIDES AND THE PURITAN MOVEMENT than human, he is possessed by an insane frenzy (11. 625, 627- 32). Then, only a very short time afterwards, we see him, still maddened, the plaything of Dionysus, consumed by a desire to witness the Bacchic revels. When this desire gains full hold of him, it reveals itself, like the prude's delight in a scandal, as a craving for the thing forbidden (1. io62). So Pentheus fell, not by the punishment which overtakes the sinner, but by the inevitable destruction which awaits the man who does not face facts. Despite his weaknesses, he was morally on a higher plane than the worshippers of Dionysus, but he failed because he refused to acknowledge a real power. His violence is a confession of insecurity. The wish uttered in a moment of weakness reveals that, although he is the enemy of Dionysus, there is a part of him which answers to Dionysus' enticements. Is this Euripides' criticism of the Puritans-not that they are ignoble, but that they are not realists? He shares their passion for righteousness, but he cannot see how they can possibly succeed by the methods they have chosen to adopt.</page></plain_text>
