<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW VOL. XXVIII JANUARY, 1928 NO. 1 CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY* The application of the definition of many crimes, such as homicide, assault, treason, and perjury, has customarily been restricted through having evil intent as an element thereof. The supposed result of such limitation is that criminal liability will rest only upon those who are morally at fault. Thus it is said, "Let the result of an action be what it may, we hold a man guilty simply on the ground of his intention, or on the same ground, we hold him innocent." The "pure mind" does not offend though the acts be ever so offensive if tested by their results. However accurate it may be to assert that "The calm judgment of mankind treasures this doctrine among its jewels,"' it should be at least equally obvious that literally the doctrine originally purported to free an individual from the unintended consequences of his own acts and had no applicability whatever in determining whether there was any vicarious liability on his part for the acts of others. Failure to realize this has resulted in the extension of the conception of criminal liability as based upon moral fault or intent to excessive lengths. It is believed that this is true of the many cases where the moral fault or intent prin- ciple is applied in imposing liability, as the result of criminal proceed- ings, upon one who has not committed the acts or omissions involved in the crime or had any special knowledge thereof or intent in respect thereto. Thus, for instance, the servant's intent is "imputed" to his master. Thus the courts discuss the question whether a legal entity, such as a corporation, can "really" have an intent to kill. Nowadays, however, the conception of criminal liability as based only upon moral fault is met with the more realistic conception of criminal liability with- out moral fault. The dogma of respondeat superior and qui facit per alium facit per se is now found to be quite as usefully vague as the * The writer is indebted to Middleton Beaman, Esq., Legislative Counsel, House of Representatives, for much valuable criticism of the original manuscript of the present article, and to McClure Kelley, Special Assistant in the Department of Justice, formerly Law Assistant in the Office of the Legislative Counsel, for his efforts in bringing up to date the citations in the manuscript covering the past seven years. 11 BISHOP, NEW CRIMINAL LAW (8th ed. 1892) ? 289.</page><page sequence="2">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW dogma of actus non facit reum, nisi mens rea. Such vagueness has served admirably as a vent to one's subliminal intuitions when further explanation has been found too troublesome. So these Latin phrases remain as monuments to the immortality not only of the supposedly de- funct language, but of what is believed to be the mouldy reasoning which it glosses in the field of corporate criminal liability. The scope of this article is restricted, for the most part, to the liability of a stockholder, director, officer, or employee of a private corporation for the acts of a servant of the corporation, when such liability is without fault and of a criminal nature. In the case of a director, officer, or employee such liability is imposed in criminal pro- ceedings in which he is the defendant. In the case of the stockholder such liability results from fines imposed upon the corporation in crim- inal proceedings against it. In effect fines imposed upon a corporation will, in practically all cases, depreciate the pecuniary interest of the stock- holders in the corporate assets, and the criminal proceedings, there- fore, while directed in name against the corporation, are, so far as actual effect is concerned, proceedings against the stockholders. In the following classification of corporate criminal liability there are separated out those types which involve criminal liability without moral fault of the shareholders or of the directors, officers, or employees for the acts of others, i.e., vicarious criminal liability, from those types of such liability which involve only the direct liability of the share- holder or of the director, officer, or employee for his own acts: A. Liability of the shareholder: First. The direct criminal liability of the shareholder for his own acts, failures, or omissions-a case found but rarely in the reports. Second. The vicarious liability of the shareholder for the acts, failures, or omissions of the directors, officers, and employees that in effect results from successful criminal proceedings against the corpora- tion. This is the most common case of corporate criminal liability. B. Liability of the director, officer, or employee: Third. The direct criminal liability of the director, officer, or employee for his own acts, failures, or omissions-the next most com- mon case. Fourth. The vicarious criminal liability of the director, officer, or employee for the acts, failures, and omissions of the stockholders- as yet a non-existent case on the reports. Fifth. The vicarious criminal liability of the director, officer, or employee for the acts, failures, and omissions of his subordinates-the case most recently developed. 2</page><page sequence="3">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY Sixth. The vicarious criminal lialility of the subordinate for the acts, failures, or omissions of his superior director or officer-a rare but actually reported case. In dealing with the different classes of vicarious corporate criminal liability it is proposed to treat in the following order: I. The liability of the shareholders resulting from criminal pro- ceedings against the corporation. II. The criminal liability of the directors, officers, and employees (a) as based upon the doctrine of responsibility for the management of the corporation affairs in accordance with law, and (b) as based upon the doctrines of accessory to or conspirator with the corporate entity. III. The constitutional law aspects of vicarious corporate crim- inal liability. IV. Legislative attempts to compel the stricter enforcement of corporate criminal liability. V. The inutility of the corporate entity theory in the considera- tion of corporate criminal liability. I. LIABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS The normal example of the criminal liability of the shareholders of a corporation occurs when the shareholders have delegated the con- trol of the management of their interests to representatives, as directors, officers, and their subordinates, and are in effect, as heretofore sug- gested, made vicariously liable, through criminal proceedings against the corporation, for the acts of these representatives.2 2 Of course, the case may arise where each shareholder of the corporation commits acts constituting a crime, as the entrance into an ultra vires agreement in restraint of trade. Cf. People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 121 N. Y. 582, 24 N. E. 834 (1890), a proceeding for revocation of charter. In State ex rel. Attorney General v. Standard Oil Co., 49 Ohio St. 137, 30 N. E. 279 (1892), the combined acts of all but seven of the 35,000 share- holders in transferring the stock to the trustees of the Standard Oil Trust are held to constitute a crime committed by the corporation. It was, however, a crime for which the shareholders, inasmuch as they personally committed the unlawful acts, were directly and not vicariously liable. The facts in the case show that the unlawful acts of the shareholders were not executed by means of a stockholders' meeting or other formal proceedings peculiar to the corpora- tion. This rather leads to the conclusion that the crime is not strictly a cor- porate crime but merely a group of acts which, while pertaining to the corpora- tion, are not corporate acts, and so constitute merely a group of individual crimes of the shareholders not committed in their capacity as shareholders of the corporation. Cf. Hohfeld, Nature of Stockholders' Individual Liability for Corporation Debts (1909) 9 COLUMBIA LAW REV. 285, 291-4. There is another, but, it is believed, less common definition of a corporate crime, namely, a crime comprised of acts of members of the corporation and relating to the corpora- tion's affairs rather than a crime comprised of acts committed in the execution of the corporate authority vested in the actors and in accordance with the for- mal corporation procedure, if any, prescribed for the particular act. Such a 3</page><page sequence="4">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The earliest and broadest objection of the courts to such liability was the oft cited statement credited to Lord Holt in a note to an anony- mous case decided in 1701: "A corporation is not indictable, but the par- ticular members of it are."3 Members or shareholders are individually indictable, it is true, if they have participated in or committed an act which may result in criminal proceedings,4 but such liability has no relation to any vicarious liability suffered in their character as corporate members or shareholders. As to the first part of the statement, "A corporation is not indictable," conformity to it was apparently not even the practice of Lord Holt's own day or bench.5 The apocryphal nature of the report may well be reason for placing it within those cases which extorted from his lordship the bitter complaint against his reporters, "that the stuff which they publish would make posterity think ill of his understanding, and that of his brethren on the bench." Nevertheless, it was not until a much later date, 1840, that West- minster Hall first expressly sustained the liability of a corporation to indictment.6 The facts of Regina v. Birmingham and Gloucester Rail- way Company show that the railroad had not complied with an order of the justices requiring the repair of a bridge. The court held the corporation was indictable for the contempt. And with the exception of a very few cases, judges have invariably made corporations liable for disobedience of judicial orders.7 Mere failure to act, regardless of the intent of the defaulter, is enough to constitute this criminal offense.8 Moreover, this English case is cited usually not only as authority for the indictment of a corporation but also for its indictment for all nonfeasances. But while ready acquiescence was given to this definition would support the Ohio court's terminology and conclusion. See the discussion of Finch, J., in People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., supra, 615-21. See also, Rex. v. Gaul, Holt 363, 364 (1738), and Queen v. Gt. North of Eng. Ry., 9 Ad. &amp; El. (N. s.) 315, 326 (1846). 12 Mod. 559 (1701).

State v. Great Works Milling Company9 in which the court refused to hold the company liable for obstructing a river, is the case usually adverted to for the proposition that the criminal liability of a corporation extends only to nonfeasance and no further. It seems, however, that the court there recognized that the proposition actually involved was, in effect, the holding liable of an innocent dissenting minority of stockholders as a result of the success- ful prosecution of the corporation. This result the court desired to avoid and did so by freeing the corporation and limiting criminal liability to the individuals concerned in the violation. For the court to say that a corporation "can neither commit a crime or misdemeanor, by any positive or affirmative act" is, of course, not an accurate expres- sion of the problem involved. Nevertheless the expression was seized upon by members of the bench and writers of legal texts as showing the intent by the court to create a distinction between criminal liability for misfeasance and nonfeasance. It seems rather that the court sought to .deny all vicarious liability of corporate shareholders. However, the distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance is never anything more than the difference between negative and positive expression of the same circumstances ;10 not but what one or the other method of ex- pression may in a particular instance be the easier or clearer way of conveying the idea of their common factor,-how shall the individual act? And if it is true that such a distinction ever did exist in the law of corporate criminal liability, it certainly no longer has support." Nevertheless it cannot be denied, despite the care which many courts have taken to repudiate any such distinction, that there is a vague feel- ing that their artificial persons can be more easily conceived of as failing to act than as having the physical body necessary, for example, to carry logs with which to obstruct rivers and highways.12 920 Me. 41 (1841), said in State v. City of Portland, 74 Me. 268 (1883) to have been overruled. 10"It may be added, that the distinction between a nonfeasance and a mis- feasance is often one more of form than of substance. There are cases where it would be difficult to say whether the offense consisted in the doing of an un- lawful act, or in the doing of a lawful act in an improper manner. In the case at bar, it would be no great refinement to say, that the defendants are in- dicted for not constructing their draws in a suitable manner, and thereby ob- structing navigation, which would be a nonfeasance, and not for unlawfully placing obstructions in the river, which would be a misfeasance. The difficulty in distinguishing the character of these offenses strongly illustrates the absurdity of the doctrine that corporations are indictable for a nonfeasance, but not for a misfeasance."

L. 360 (1852). 5</page><page sequence="6">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The main resistance to the extension of the doctrine of criminal liability without fault as applied to corporations has been built around the phrase actus non facit reum, nisi mens rea. According to those advocates of the corporate entity theory who consider the entity as a fictitious but nevertheless necessary jural abstraction, the corporation must have malice aforethought or evil intent in order to be criminally liable.13 Thus it is said by the King's Bench: "By the general principles of criminality, if a matter is made a criminal offense, it is essential that there should be something in the nature of a mens rea, and therefore in ordinary cases a corporation cannot be guilty of a criminal offense, nor can a master be liable criminally for an offense committed by his servant."'4 Bigelow, J., of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, states the proposi- tion: "Corporations cannot be indicted for offenses which derive their crim- inality from evil intent, or which consist in a violation of those social duties which pertain to men and subjects. They cannot be guilty of treason or felony, or offenses against the person."' And following Baron Manwood's syllogism: "None can create souls but God; but a corporation is created by the king; therefore a corporation can have no soul,"16 it would be obvious, at least to Baron Manwood, that an entity which has no soul, can have no conscience or criminal intent.17 It would seem that although the corporate entity theory may be called by the courts a jural fiction, nevertheless it has become so great a reality to many judges that their opinions seem to forget that the fiction is only a convenient method of stating the fact of a particular type of association. On the other hand, those advocates of the corporate entity theory who regard the entity not as a fictitious jural abstraction, but as a reality and an organic personality,18 readily come to the conclusion that 13 Cf.

REV. 404. 6</page><page sequence="7">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY the corporation has a mind and so may have the evil intent necessary to criminal liability. Mr. Laski has stated this view in the following fashion: "Clearly, the problem of whether a corporation can have a mens rea, has, sometimes a little doubtfully, been answered [by the courts] in the nega- tive. Taken with the cases in tort, we must collect the opinion that it can- not have a mind at all. Yet we cannot, in fact, do without that mind. Just as we have been compelled by the stern exigencies of events to recognize that the corporation is distinct from its members, so, too, we have to recog- nize that its mind is distinct from their mind .... "By admitting the existence of the corporate mind, that mind can be a guilty mind if it can be punished by way of fines; and if it be mulcted with sufficient heaviness, we may be certain that it will not offend again. What is the alternative? To attack some miserable agent who has been acting in the interest of a mindless principal; an agent, as Maitland said, who is the 'servant of an Unknowable Somewhat.' "19 But the courts have not adopted this more spectacular theory. However, the judges while maintaining that a corporate entity is not a reality but merely a necessary jural fiction, and that, therefore, the entity can have no criminal intent, still find themselves forced in the large majority of actual situations which confront them, to avoid the logical consequence of their conception of the corporate entity theory as a jural fiction, and to hold the corporation criminally liable. It is therefore interesting to leave aside all consideration of that interminable dispute as to the fictitious or real quality of such jural apparitions as corporate personalities and the possibility of an evil intent issuing from their vaporous minds, and to align the decisions merely with a view to discovering what concrete situations exist in which corporate share- holders, despite pious declarations of the contrary doctrine, actually have in practical effect, been held subject without criminal intent to a liability, as the result of criminal proceedings against the corporation, for the acts of their directors, officers, or employees. Further it will be of interest to pass upon the merits of the logic by which this result has been reached without confessedly repudiating the doctrine of crim- inal intent and the necessity for the corporate entity theory. The large majority of the earlier indictments against corporations involved cases of public nuisance. Criminal intent was held not to be an element necessary to the success of these criminal actions. Applied to actual conditions this means no more than that the corporate inter- ests of shareholders may be depreciated by being subjected to fines be- cause of the failure of officers to take proper action, though the members " Laski, Ioc. cit. 415-16.</page><page sequence="8">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW or stockholders themselves were guilty of no moral lapses. Thus a corporation has been held liable for obstructing a river channel,20 or highway,21 producing miasmatic vapors,22 negligently maintaining a powder magazine in a thickly populated neighborhood,23 and failing to repair a canal bridge.24 And generally statutory crimes consisting of minor offenses analo- gous to public nuisances or torts are held not to require a criminal in- tent for their violation. For instance, corporations have been liable for permitting gaming at fair grounds,25 unlicensed practice of medicine,26 delivery of liquor to minors,27 failing to license its peddler agents,28 failing to repair highways,29 exacting usurious rates of interest,30 violat- ing the Espionage Act,31 and violation of the child labor law.32 Sim- ilarly a railroad which worked its track gangs on Sundays was held a violator of a Sabbath-breaking statute, a blue-law obviously aimed at what was supposed to be the immorality of the law-breaker. But the court avoided the moral question by construing the act as a one-day-of- rest-in-seven law. Thus the necessity that the breach involve moral fault or evil intent, was avoided.33 It becomes evident that a large number of cases exist where the doctrine that evil intent is a necessary part of liability through criminal proceedings, fails of application by reason of a frank holding that evil intent is not a necessary element of the offense. Some writers attempt to distinguish the nuisance cases on the ground that the indictment of the nuisance is merely a civil liability 20 Comm. v.

This result is achieved usually by "imputing" the intent of the officers to the corpora- tion.36 Other language is occasionally used, however,-vague expres- sions which lead one at first to the belief that evil intent is not thought necessary by some courts to conviction for conspiracy. A Minnesota court asserts "Malice is not an essential element in the prosecution."37 And the United States Supreme Court holds that the government need not show the intent with which the agreement was made so long as its effect was to restrain trade.38 Probably in these cases the judges had nothing more in mind than the application of the criminal law rule that "malice is presumed from a deliberate unlawful act, for a man will be held to intend the necessary and probable consequences of his own acts."39 Nevertheless, translated this would seem to mean that one may be held liable for a crime even though he had no evil intent. Of course, a person of sound mind intends to do the acts he undertakes, but he may intend them to have far different consequences than those which result.40 He may intend and believe that a combination instead of re- 4 Cf.

It may be obvious, and obvious to the actor, that the consequence will follow, and he may be liable for it even if he regrets it, but he does not do the act with intent to produce it unless the aim to produce it is the proximate motive of the specific act, although there may be some deeper motive behind." 9</page><page sequence="10">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW straining trade will further its development to the benefit of society and yet not limit competition unreasonably. Such cases then fall outside the original scope of the doctrine of intent which was that a man should be liable for acts only when he intended they should have evil results. Consequently the rule of presumption of malice from a deliberate act serves merely as a paralogism to delude oneself into the belief that the application of actus non facit reum, nisi mens rea, is being continued. In State v. Passaic County Agricultural Society41 a corporation was convicted of the public nuisance of keeping a disorderly house. While not necessary to the decision, because habitual use for vicious practices regardless of the intent that prompted the disorder was thought suffi- cient to constitute the crime, the court held that malice and evil intent may be "imputed" to corporations in criminal proceedings. By similar logic a corporation has been made criminally responsible for a libel published by its editor,42 knowingly mailing an obscene newspaper,43 wilfully damaging a tenement,44 hiring an employee for more than an eight-hour day,45 knowingly soliciting and importing contract laborers,46 intentionally undervaluing a freight shipment,47 and unlawfully taking salmon.48 In the most of these cases the statutory requirement of knowledge or wilfulness prevented a conviction based on the theory that an evil intent was unnecessary to criminal prosecution. In conse- quence, just as in the conspiracy cases, the doctrine of the imputability of intent was used. It is in connection with those crimes, customarily considered the most serious, such as homicides and assaults, that there is first found judicial refusal to impose criminal liability vicariously with reference to corporations.

" ... as the law stands at present, it seems that a corporation cannot be made criminally liable for such acts as are spoken of as crimes in the more popular sense of the word, that is, crimes of which the essence is the per- sonal criminal intent or malice, or negligence carried to an extent that it amounts to wilfully incurring the risk of causing injury to others. Whether, if a corporation can be held criminally liable, as it certainly can, for one class of cases, resulting from negligence [the public nuisance cases presumably], it is illogical not to extend its liability to manslaughter resulting from neg- ligence, it is not for me to say; but sitting as a trial judge, I cannot say that I have any doubt that, as the law stands at present, I cannot so extend it." It is to be noted, however, that the present standing of the law as cited by the judge consists of dicta from three English cases. However, during the same year the Canadian Supreme Court in considering an appeal from British Columbia fined a colliery company $5,000 because of deaths occurring when one of its trains fell through a truss bridge over the Trent river.50 One judge dissented. The court, however, was enabled to avoid the question of intent because the indictment had been framed for criminal negligence instead of manslaughter. The practical result, however, was that the corporation became criminally liable for homicide. A Pennsylvania county court a year later took a backward step in refusing to hold a street railway criminally liable for an assault in ejecting a passenger. Its decision was based on the absence of precedent warranting the extension.51 The most prominent case on this point, however, is that of People v. Rochester Railway and Light Company.52 Because of the faulty installation of a water heating apparatus, escaping gas asphyxiated an occupant of the house. The court was unable to overcome the difficulty presented by a statute which read that man- slaughter was "the killing of one human being by another,"-"another" being held eiusdem generis with the term preceding it53 and so meaning 49 See Queen v.

Hence not a single case is to be found to sustain this indictment. We should make haste slowly when it is in the direction of holding either an individual or a corporation criminally liable for a crime committed by an em- ployee without his or its knowledge or consent.

Apparently the decision was confined to the peculiar statute at hand because the court said: "... we have no doubt that a definition of certain forms of manslaugh- ter might have been formulated which would be applicable to a corporation, and make it criminally liable for various acts of misfeasance and non- feasance when resulting in death, and amongst which very probably might be included conduct in substance similar to that here charged against the respondent." This decision was later followed in Kentucky under a similar statute.54 On the whole the tenderness with which resistance is placed against vicarious liability for homicides and assaults makes reasonably certain the prediction that the law will grow in accord with the result reached by the Canadian Supreme Court.55 In earlier times it was said that corporations could not "commit treason, nor be outlawed nor excommunicated for they have no souls."56 The case of treason may again arise and as good a guess as any is that as to this crime the policy of criminal liability as based upon personal moral fault only will predominate. This conclusion will also probably be true of any attempt to indict a corporation for perjury,57 because an affiant must personally perform the ceremony necessary to take upon himself the obligation of the oath. Of course, it is not inherently im- possible that vicarious jural consequences should result from the taking of an oath and from treason as well as from an act of homicide or a conspiracy. No arbitrary line can be drawn. But law is built upon differences in the degree to which each conflicting principle is applied, not on the logical necessity, not to mention impossibility, of following each of them to the bitter end. The "high nature" of treason may be a reason for limiting criminal liability for it to those who were evil 64Comm. v. Illinois Central R. R., 152 Ky. 320, 153 S. W. 459 (1913).

The fact that moral fault, no matter under what guise, mens rea, evil intent, or malice, may not be necessary to criminal liability is nowhere more easily illustrated than by these cases of corporate criminal liabil- ity. Practically every case in which the corporation is subjected to criminal liability involves, in effect, the liability not of the director, offi- cer, or employee who had such evil intent, but of shareholders who are innocent of any direct moral fault. And yet the fact that what is called "corporate criminal liability" is really the imposition of a vicarious criminal liability, the liability of corporate shareholders substituted for that of their directors, officers, or employees, is a realization but rarely found in judicial opinions. There the discussion revolves about the effect of the fictional characteristics of corporate entities. To be sure their lack of soul is no longer an overwhelming difficulty. But such anthropomorphic considerations continue in several other forms. The inability of an entity to commit rape or bigamy or adultery is referred to with a serious persistency that provokes ridicule, and all for the pur- pose of proving that such impotency should prevent criminal liabilities from attaching to the corporation for other crimes. Lopes, J., of the Queen's Bench asserts: "A corporation or company could not sue [for libel] in respect of a charge of murder, incest, or adultery because it could not commit these crimes."8 While the federal courts assure themselves as follows: "Of course there are certain crimes of which a corporation cannot be guilty; as for instance, bigamy, perjury, rape, murder, and other offenses which will easily suggest themselves to the mind. Crimes like these men- tioned can only be committed by natural persons."59 58 See South Helton Coal Co. v. North Eastern News Ass'n, [1894] 1 Q. B. 133, 141. 9 See U. S. v. John Kelso Co., 86 Fed. 304, 306 (N. D. Calif. "Those who maintain that corporations can commit crimes, are driven to make exceptions; for no jurist asserts that adultery or bigamy can on any principle, or by any analogy, be imputed to bodies corporate." Lindley, Capacity of Corporations (1857) 2 JURIDICAL Soc. PAPERS 31, 35. "It is true that there are some crimes, which in their nature, cannot be com- mitted by corporations. But there is a large class of offenses, of which rebating under the Federal statutes is one, wherein the crime consists in purposely doing the things prohibited by statute. In that class of crimes we see no good reason why corporations may not be held responsible for and charged with the knowl- edge and purposes of their agents, acting within the authority conferred upon them." Day, J., in New York Central R. R. v. U. S., 212 U. S. 481, 494-5, 29 Sup. Ct. 304, 307 (1909). 13</page><page sequence="14">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW But obviously where the question is the criminal responsibility of a group of natural persons for the acts of other natural persons, there is nothing in the inherent nature of rape, bigamy, or adultery that would prevent shareholders of a corporation from being held vicariously liable for such acts by their officers or employees. That such a result is not found in the law, is due to the fact that sexual acts are not within the field of corporate enterprises, and therefore the commission of such acts by an officer or employee would not be reasonably related to the execution of the phase of management entrusted to such officer or employee. The courts have also tried to solve the question of corporate liability for other crimes upon the basis of the corporate entity's physi- cal ability to commit the necessary acts: "It is manifest that whether a corporation can be convicted of a crim- inal offense depends, not upon the technical name, treason, felony, or mis- demeanor, attached to the crime, but is one of whether the crime is such that a corporation is capable of committing it."6? Again as we have already seen the persistent anthropomorphic con- sideration that the corporation as a "person" must have a mind has served to prevent corporate criminal liability for the acts of a corporate officer or employee, because it was obviously the latter's mind, and not that of the entity, which had the mens rea deemed necessary to over- come this barrier to criminal liability interposed so unnecessarily. The greater part of the more recent cases have in consequence either held that criminal intent was not an element of the particular crime or else, with a verbal simplicity that hides the real difficulty, have "imputed" to the mind of the entity a criminal intent. It would seem that the idea of a corporate entity, despite constant judicial assertion to the contrary, has not been so much 'of a fiction to the courts that they could easily lop off the tentacles of such a far-reaching conception."6 In a com- paratively recent case, for instance, the corporate entity theory received its extreme application-though with perfect logic-when the corpora- tion was held one of the two persons necessary for forming a conspiracy to violate a federal statute, the other being the corporation's president who had made no agreement in furtherance of a conspiracy with any other member or officer of the corporation for the obvious reason that he alone constituted practically the whole personnel of the corporation, and doubtless found the entity too ethereal a party to give him practical aid in concealing and removing assets.62 6 See Joplin Mercantile Co. v.

A. 2d, 1907). 14</page><page sequence="15">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY A final anthropomorphic difficulty conjured up in regard to im- posing corporate criminal liability is that of imprisoning or hanging a corporation in punishment for crime. "I quite agree that a corporation cannot, in one sense, commit a crime- a corporation cannot be imprisoned, if imprisonment be the sentence for the crime; a corporation cannot be hanged or put to death if that be the pun- ishment for the crime; and so, in those senses a corporation cannot com- mit a crime" ;3 but then Lord Blackburn continues: "A corporation may be fined and a corporation may pay damages." Again the real question is, can shareholders be imprisoned for the acts of their officers. Obviously the problem presents no physical difficul- ties. That members and stockholders are not so imprisoned depends rather on legal difficulties. Corporations are commonly formed for the purpose of limiting the incorporators' civil liabilities resulting from the fact of such corporate membership, to their interests in the corpor- ate assets. By analogy this limitation is carried over into the field of criminal liability. Consequently a fine to be paid from the shareholder's interest in the corporate assets, but not from other property of the shareholders, is the only penalty ever imposed.64 One exception, how- ever, exists. The public has the further remedy of revocation of the privilege of doing business as a corporation. But though the law re- fuses to imprison stockholders for a corporate crime, still a corporation may be guilty of a crime whose only punishment is imprisonment.65 The legal objection to imprisonment will, however, permit the corpora- tion to go unpunished despite the guilt of its officers, that is, vicarious liability will properly not be carried to the extent of subjecting the 3 See Pharmaceutical Soc. v. London, etc. Supply Ass'n, Ltd., 5 App. Cas. 857, 869 (1880), per Lord Blackburn. See also State v. Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 166 N. C. 366, 81 S. E. 737 (1914), and American Fork City v. Charlier, 43 Utah 231, 238, 134 Pac. 739, 742 (1913), where the court said that a corporation "may be in- dicted or informed against, and in such event may, by special process, be brought into court, and may be tried and convicted of certain offenses, and be fined in a specific sum of money, and the fine may be collected upon execution if there is any corporate property or assets. This is as far as the state can enforce its criminal laws against the artificial entity called a corporation." 4 Of course, the shareholders may in certain instances become personally liable for a fine levied against the corporation, such liability, under an applica- tion of the trust fund doctrine, to be enforced against property in the hands of the shareholders rather than against their interests in the corporate assets. Such instances occur, for example, when a fine has been imposed against the corporation but the payment is avoided by a transfer of all the corporate assets to its stockholders. See Pierce v. U. S., 255 U. S. 398, 41 Sup. Ct. 365 (1921). a "The corporation-the bankrupt-could violate the special provisions against fraudulently concealing its assets. Its acts would be criminal notwith- standing its corporate character would prevent its punishment." Cohen v. U. S., 157 Fed. 651, 653 (C. C. A. 2d, 1907). Lord Blackburn's statement, supra note 56, possibly confuses the declaration of what constitutes the crime with the punishment imposed for falling within the standard of criminality thus declared. 15</page><page sequence="16">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW shareholders to imprisonment as distinguished from depreciating by fine their pecuniary interests in the assets of the corporation.66 II. LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AND EMPLOYEES (a) Doctrine of Responsibility for Management. In the case of a duty placed upon a corporate enterprise, either by virtue of a jural doctrine originating with the courts or else by a statutory declaration of a legislature, the non-observance of which calls for criminal pro- ceedings, the shareholders, as has been seen, are those upon whom the subsequent penalty is, in effect, commonly imposed. The "corporation" is liable, as we say. It is only upon second thought that any other con- ception of liability occurs to one in connection with a corporate criminal violation. But though the cases are few and scattered, they show that the law has commenced to enforce penalties against the corporate offi- cers, as well as shareholders, for a corporate criminal violation. Without doubt judges and legislators have felt intuitively, if un- reasoningly, that duties imposed upon individuals who are no part of any incorporated enterprise should also in most cases rest upon those groups of individuals who do form an incorporated enterprise. A corporation is no more justified in committing a nuisance, for instance, than an individual. In consequence in the case of duties or prohibi- tions imposed by legislation, the courts have usually felt forced, to the great resulting confusion of the law, to hold that "person" includes "corporation,"67 and that therefore legislation placing a duty upon "persons," is a command to the incorporated enterprise as well as the unassociated individual. Today almost all jurisdictions in a general act so define "persons"68 besides often redefining it in important legisla- tion. But granted that the duty rests upon the incorporated enterprise, who is to be held liable to the criminal penalties for the non-compliance Love v.

"Quite consistently with anything thus far stated, it is of course possible, as a mere matter of words and definitions, to say, even with an intention to speak literally, that the association of natural persons is itself a person-a 'legal' or 'juristic' person. But doesn't this do some violence to the vocabulary? The generic term person thus acquires an unfortunately wide and peculiar de- notation and a somewhat muddled connotation hardly consistent with our usual modes of thought and speech. Is is not like calling a drove of horses a horse or a deck of cards a card? This arbitrary mode of definition by en- larging the generic scope of a term is possible, but hardly useful.

Statutes which fail, as practically all of them do, to make proper distinctions and thus answer this question, would seem to violate- a most elementary principle of criminal law, namely, that no individual will be held crim- inally liable under a statutory prohibition unless the statute specifies with reasonable certainty that he is one of those individuals to whom the prohibition applies.69 Mr. Thomas Baty, speaking with reference to master and servant cases, notes this injustice in regard to English legis- lation. Is the servant or the master or both to be liable for the servant's violation of the law? constantly suffering from a loose, undiscriminating, and misleading terminology; and, in the opinion of the present writer, this is particularly true of the law of corporations." * * * * * * "In reality when we say that the so-called legal or juristic person has rights or that it has contracted, we mean nothing more than what must ulti- mately be explained by describing the capacities, powers, rights, privileges (or liberties), disabilities, duties and liabilities, etc., of the natural persons con- cerned or of some of such persons. Suppose we consider, e.g., a so-called con- tract made by a corporation as the result of a majority vote of the stock- holders in regular meeting. The real nature of this transaction can be ade- quately understood only if, looking beneath the ordinary language and forms, we observe that the net result is the consequence of the concurrent exercise of the individual legal powers of the respective stockholders. Thus, if there are fifty stockholders, each holding one share, and if thirty vote for the contract and twenty against it, and if, in accordance with this vote and authorization, the corporation agent executes the contract with the third person, then all of the fifty stockholders become bound. As a consequence of the concurrent exer- cise of the legal powers of the thirty, in opposition to a similar concurrent exer- cise of the legal powers of the twenty, an obligation is fixed ultimately upon the latter as well as upon the former. This may show, as it seems to the writer, that the obligation is quasi-contractual rather than contractual. But the fact that the transaction results from the unified action of the stockholders hardly makes it necessary or desirable that the association of natural per- sons should be called a person with a 'real personality.' As well might we say that thirty men lifting a heavy iron rail should be called a 'person,' or that ten horses drawing a single load should be designated as a 'horse.' "Doesn't this roundabout process of explanation necessitated by calling the association a juristic person suggest the same objection that has been made con- cerning a certain other legal fiction? Is it not like looking at things through smoked glass and then holding a candle on the other side in order to see them? If this be so, it appears even more objectionable to speak of a corporation as an abstract entity or personality distinct from the sum of the stockholders. Is it not better, then, as a matter of words and definitions, to say with emphasis that, as applied to associations of natural persons considered as units, the terms, right, duty, contract, etc., should never be used excepf in a figurative sense,-that is, as a sort of legal shorthand? Cf. AUSTIN, JURISPRUDENCE (5th ed. 1885) 354: 'Legal persons' are persons by a figment, and for the sake of brevity in discourse. All rights reside in, and all duties are incumbent upon, physical or natural persons. But by ascribing them to feigned persons, and not to the physical persons whom they in truth concern, we are frequently able to abridge our descriptions of them.'"-Hohfeld, Nature of Stockholders' Individ- ual Liability for Corporation Debts (1909) 9 COLUMBIA LAW REV. 285, 290, note 14. 9 Cf.

Vicarious criminal liability is imposed haphazardly and with an arbitrary hand. Worse than all it can seldom be certain whether the penalties of a statute can be safely held to be vicarious or not. It would be much more straightforward and satisfactory if penalties were strictly imposed on em- ployers for failure to secure the due provisions of statutes by their servants, in cases where this is intended. To make an employer an insurer of his servants conduct may be to throw an exceedingly heavy liability upon him, altogether beyond what Parliament would ever have intended."70 There have already been discussed the cases showing how wide- spread has become the policy of holding the shareholders liable as the result of criminal proceedings directed against the "corporation." From such cases one would with overwhelming reason conclude that the ordi- nary view of the courts is that if any one is to be subjected to penalties for a corporate criminal violation, the shareholders are primarily liable and that any liability of a corporate director, officer, or employee is in the nature of a cumulative remedy on the part of the public. And yet exceptions to this view have been expressed. For instance, there is the statement of an Alabama court when, consequent upon non-payment of a corporation license tax, the superintendent of the Alabama Ware- house Company, who it is to be noted was also a shareholder in the concern, was held liable in a criminal action: "There are a few cases in which indictments will lie against a corpora- tion. But as such a body is 'invisible, intangible, and exists only in contem- plation of law,' it is the natural person in and by whom it moves, lives and operates that the law generally holds responsible for its offenses against the public."' At that date it is to be noted the American law contained no such case and English law but one, which supports this "generally" held principle. Certain it is that the development of a doctrine of the liabil- ity in criminal proceedings of the officers of an incorporated enterprise, based in general upon their responsibility for the management and operation of the corporate affairs within the limits placed upon the corporation by law, is, save for a single case, of a more recent origin than the doctrines which now give rise to a criminal liability on the part of the shareholders. The first case of this sort seems to have occurred in 1834.72 The directors, general superintendent, and engineer of the Equitable Gas 70BATY, VICARIOUS LIABILITY (1916) 218-19. 7 See Elsberry v.

Owing to imperfections in the machinery for con- suming a liquid residue, the superintendent who was entrusted with the general management of the works and the engineer who also had "some part of the direction of the works confided to him" permitted the liquid to flow into the river. This afflux "smelt ready to knock a body down" and the reporter in a footnote assures us that a sample produced in court "fully justified the statement" of the witness. The directors, however, were ignorant of these conditions as they went but rarely to the works and never interfered in the actual management. In absence of comment in the court's opinion it may be presumed that the criminal liability of the superintendent and engineer was based upon the fact that they had general direction of the works and that the responsibility delegated to them included such a phase of management. But as to the directors, Denman, C. J., expressly said in summing up: "It is said that the directors were ignorant of what was being done. In my judgment that makes no difference; provided you think that they gave authority to Leadbeter (the superintendent) to conduct the works, they will be answerable." An American court much later and also without attempting to find support in any previous authority similarly held the president and treas- urer-manager of the Detroit White Lead Works subject to a nominal fine in a joint indictment with the corporation for a vapor nuisance, because they were "jointly responsible for the business." The court continues: "It is not necessary to conviction that they should have been actually en- gaged in work upon the premises. The work is carried on by employees. The directors and officers are the persons primarily responsible, and therefore the proper ones to be prosecuted."78 And in State v. Carmean,74 the court doubtless made passing reference to the above cases when it said: "There is authority for the proposition that where the result of a gen- eral method of conducting business is to create a nuisance, or in similar cases, the principal may be chargeable with the general method of conduct- ing his business, though it is carried on by his agents and servants without his immediate knowledge ..."

The Secretary of a benevo- lent institution, the Shepard's Fold, was held liable in criminal pro- ceedings under the following statute: "Whosoever having the care or custody of any child shall wilfully cause or permit the life of it to be endangered shall be guilty of a misdemeanor." The New York Court of Appeals asserted that it had "for years been the law of this State that the officers of a corporation might be indicted for the neglect of a duty resting upon it."75 However, the case upon which the assertion was buttressed involved a statute which expressly imposed the duty directly upon the officers of the corporation.76 More recently a manager of a milk concern was said to be liable under a statute making "every person" who sold milk below a fixed standard guilty of a misdemeanor.77 The milk had been watered by some employee contrary to. the manager's instructions. The court re- viewed Rex v. Medley, People v. White Lead Works, and Overland Cotton Mill Company v. People78 and expressed a general feeling that the rules applied to the principals in those cases should be expanded to cover the manager of a milk company. A new trial, however, was granted on other grounds. Finally it was suggested in State v. Young79 that the directors of a trolley company could be held criminally liable for deaths resulting from failure of the company to equip its cars with safety appliances and keep them in working order. One must conclude that so far as entirely pertinent precedents are concerned the criminal liability of the higher corporation officers as founded upon their gen- eral supervisory responsibility for the corporation management has not yet become a settled rule of law. However, some additional comfort may be obtained from Over- land Cotton Mill Company v. People80 where a joint indictment of the corporation and its assistant superintendent was sustained because of a violation of a child labor law. The assistant superintendent had delegated his authority to hire new employees to a subordinate, but the court said it would presume that the superintendent knew what occurred under his control when by due diligence he could have ascertained the facts. The case has this important bearing,-an officer cannot, merely by dele- gating his responsibility to a subordinate, relieve himself of criminal liability for a duty resting upon the incorporated enterprise.

The customary implication is liabil- ity without fault or the liability for an act or omission which is not of your own doing, e.g., the liability of the master for his servant, the principal for his agent, or the shareholder for the officers and em- ployees of the enterprise in which he is interested. Insofar as the su- perintendent was liable for the omission of his subordinate, his liability was vicarious. But a view of the converse side of the proposition com- pels one to answer that, in so far as the violation resulted from the failure of the superintendent properly to instruct and supervise his subordinate or properly to perform those many acts necessary to build- ing up an efficient personnel of subordinates, he was liable for his own acts and omissions and such liability was neither without fault nor vicarious. Of course the distinction may be made that the act or omis- sion around which the indictment was drawn was that of the subordi- nate. The shareholder, however, is ordinarily under practically no duty to supervise the affairs of the corporation, yet he is customarily an in- surer in criminal proceedings of all corporate acts and his criminal liability is therefore almost entirely vicarious. The extreme result is reached, however, when a subordinate is held liable for the failures of his superior officers. Thus the local agents of the Western Union Telegraph Company8' and of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad82 have been indicted for the fail- ure of the corporation to pay its state corporation license tax. Also under similar facts a Texas court fined a local insurance agent $50 and costs because of the ease with which the corporation could otherwise evade the payment of the tax.83 The reason for such a result obviously arises in the necessity of bringing indirect pressure to bear when the officers, charged with the duty of attending to such matters, are outside the jurisdiction of the local authorities. If, however, the phase of management in which the violation occurs is especially assigned to the care of a subordinate, he, as well as the superior officers, may be made to assume a criminal liability for the proper management of that phase of the corporate affairs and his liability is not then vicarious. For in- stance, in an English case, Rex v. Pittwood,84 a gatekeeper of a railroad, in lieu of the railroad, was held liable for manslaughter, following a fatal accident resulting from his failure to close a crossing gate. The basis of such criminal liability was considered the duty to close the 8lWilliams v. City of Talladega, 164 Ala. 633, 51 So. 330 (1909). Nashville C. &amp; St. L. Ry. v.

It becomes apparent that the courts are developing doctrines where- by the corporate executive personnel is to be placed in a jural position similar to corporate shareholders and in consequence become liable through criminal proceedings for acts, failures, or omissions which they have neither committed, authorized, nor assented to. Such a doctrine obviously involves criminal liability without a mens rea or evil intent. But the doctrine that moral fault is necessary to criminal liability has not by any means entirely given way before this newer doctrine. Thus we find cases which, insofar as they insist that the officer must have knowledge of, consent to, authorize, or participate in the criminal act in order to become criminally liable, more or less directly repudiate the basing of the criminal liability of a corporation officer upon nothing more than a duty to see that the corporation is so managed as not to violate requirements of the law. The treasurer of the New York Sun, though he superintended the newspaper's business affairs, was not held legally responsible for the unlawful insertion of a lottery advertise- ment.85 He had no actual personal connection with the insertion, nor was it made with his consent or knowledge. Further, an indictment against the treasurer in the Overland Cotton Mill Company case was not sustained, for that official had no knowledge of the violation of the child labor law nor was the hiring of employees within his control.86 However, the vice-president in charge of the southern division of an interstate mercantile business together with the local representative was held liable in criminal proceedings, for they were cognizant of the fact that subordinate agents of the corporation were peddling its goods without a necessary license.87 The test of knowledge was again ap- plied to the case of a bank president who contrary to an Oregon statute permitted special funds to be deposited and mingled with ordinary ac- tive deposits knowing that subordinates would later unwittingly pay them out along with the ordinary deposits.88 It should be kept in mind, however, that the necessity of guilty knowledge, or a mens rea for criminal liability, was a limitation to save an individual from the con- sequences of his own acts whose injurious results were unintended. It was not a limitation to preserve him from a vicarious liability for the acts of others when the prevailing social policies deem such an imposi- T8 People v. England, 27 Hun 139 (N.

Thus the misconception in using the doctrine of mens rea to substantiate such a limitation upon a corporation officer's liabil- ity to criminal penalties becomes apparent. Of course, where the stat- ute expressly provides that the violation shall consist in "knowingly permitting" the refilling of oil barrels89 or the obstruction of a road,9? or in "consenting" to corporate campaign contributions91 the court will more readily require knowledge or consent on the part of the superior officer as well as the subordinate in order to sustain the criminal pro- ceedings. In State v. Carmean92 no duty was by law imposed upon the cor- poration. The statute was addressed to the officers directly and read: "If any officer, agent, clerk or servant . . . who in any manner receives or collects money or other property for the use of and belonging to an- other, embezzles . . . any money or property . . . he is guilty of larceny." The president of a buggy company was indicted for the thefts of his subordinates. The court expressly denied that a criminal liability could result unless the officer expressly authorizes such acts. The holding, however, was unnecessary inasmuch as the officer had not even knowl- edge of the embezzlement. The case therefore does not necessarily im- pose any more stringent qualifications upon the responsibility for man- agement doctrine than that of knowledge which was required in some of the cases just discussed.93 The most extensive limitation upon the doctrine, however, is im- posed by Rex v. Hendrie.94 In this case the court refused to sustain an indictment against the president of a jockey club who had acquiesced in an illegal lease by the club of the privilege of receiving bets. The court held that mere knowledge or acquiescence is not enough to con- vict an officer. He must have personally participated in the prohibited act. One justice dissented. Later Rex v. Hays95 followed this decision by a holding that an officer is not liable unless he is an aider, abettor, or accessory in the prohibited act, mere acquiescence being insufficient. This holding, however, just as in State v. Carmean, is to some extent 9 State v. Parsons, 12 Mo. App. 205 (1882). o9 State v. White, 96 Mo. App. 34, 69 S. W. 684 (1902). '9U. S.

The decision also rested on a large number of other grounds. Similarly the federal district court in United States v. Winslow96 held directors who actively participated in making the unlawful agree- ment, liable upon indictments under the Sherman Act. The court did not make plain the theory upon which it based such liability, but con- tented itself with the statement that: "Neither in the civil or criminal law can an officer protect himself be- hind a corporation when he is the actual present and efficient actor; and ... all parties active in promoting a misdemeanor, whether agents or not, are principals." That the court did not consider such liability as based upon responsibil- ity for corporate management is evident because it expressly distin- guished between "directors of a corporation who are simply charged as such and directors acting an immediate special part in the proceed- ings in question."97 (b) Doctrine of Accessory or Conspirator. It is a principle com- monly met with in criminal law that it is unlawful to authorize, par- ticipate in, or abet an unlawful act, or to conspire to violate the law. By putting this legal tool to ingenious use, the courts have approached the problem of the criminal liability of a corporation officer from two additional aspects, that of an accessory or abettor to, and that of a con-. spirator with, the corporation in the violation. The distinction between accessory before the fact and principal existed at common law only in the case of felonies,9 and all aiders and abettors of misdemeanors were indictable as principals. But even this distinction has in most states been eliminated by statute and the United States Penal Code, section 332, now provides: "Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission is a principal."" 195 Fed. 578 (D.

But the doctrine that an individual, though he does not in any way communicate or act in conjunction with another mortal soul, may nevertheless by his wrongdoing be abetting or conspiring with that immortal entity, the corporation, is one of those peculiar judicial fancies that, were it not for the desirable results often achieved by their use, would be unqualifiedly condemned by all save those whose naive faith in the metaphysician's logic cannot be disturbed by earthly facts. The most exhaustive case on the subject of criminal liability of corporation officers, People v. Clark,l01 veered off on the doctrine of accessories. This occurred because the defendants, a railroad presi- dent and directors, admitted by demurrer that they had personally par- ticipated in a violation of a New York State statute prohibiting any steam road from heating its cars by a stove or furnace kept inside a car. The facts, however, showed no such personal participation by these officers, but only a general responsibility for the management of the road. However, because of the admission by demurrer, the di- rectors were found to have aided and abetted the corporation in the commission of a misdemeanor. Minus the metaphysics, this would seem to mean that the directors, despite the factual absence of personal participation, were held responsible just as though they had in fact aided and abetted the commission of certain acts by other employees of the railroad corporation who actually did commit the acts. In other words, a vicarious criminal liability was in fact imposed upon the directors. That the court would not have reached this result had it not been for the ill- advised admission by demurrer of personal participation, is at least implied by its assertions that mere neglect to observe the statutory re- quirements does not constitute a crime save by those upon whom the statute expressly imposes a duty, and that moreover, the officers are not liable "as officers," as though the statute placed a requirement directly on them as such, but only because they actually aided and abetted the doing of the act. 100See Kelly v. U. S., 258 Fed. 392, 402 (C. C. A. 6th, 1919), and cases there cited, certiorari denied, 249 U. S. 616, 39 Sup. Ct. 391 (1918). These fa- miliar doctrines as to accessories perhaps influenced the Ontario court to place a limitation of personal participation upon the doctrine of responsibility for management. See Rex v. Hendrie, 11 Ont. L. Rep. 202, (1905) and Rex v. Hays, 14 Ont. L. Rep. 201 (1907). 1018 N. Y. Crim. 179, 14 N. Y. Supp. 642 (1891). 25</page><page sequence="26">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW In Wood v. United States'02 the court said: "Speaking with tech- nical accuracy, the corporation committed the offense and Wood (the president) .actively abetted and so is guilty as principal under section 332 of the Penal Code." And in Rex v. Campbelll03 the president and principal shareholder of a corporation for which he had in person obtained credit through false pretenses, a crime under Quebec statutes, was held liable as an aider and abettor and indicted as a principal under a statute similar to section 332 of the United States Penal Code. In Kaufman v. United States,l04 however, the peculiar drafting of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, section 29b of which read: "A person shall be punished by imprisonment not to exceed two years upon the conviction of the offense of having knowingly and frauduently concealed while a bankrupt or after his discharge from his trustee any of the property belonging to his estate in bankruptcy."" in a measure forced the decision to be based upon this anomalous doc- trine of accessory to a corporation, in order to convict an officer who concealed assets of his corporation. Section 1 (19) of the Act further defines "persons" so as to "include corporations . . . and officers, partnerships, and women, and when used with reference to the commission of acts which are herein for- bidden, shall include persons who are participants in the forbidden acts and the agents, officers, members of the board of directors or trustees or other similar controlling bodies of corporations." However, this meticulously comprehensive definition went for naught because quite naturally the courts interpreted the words "while a bank- rupt" to apply to "person" even when thus defined to include an offi- cer.106 As a result an indictment of a corporation officer who concealed assets could not be sustained unless the officer, himself, as well as the corporation, was in bankruptcy.107 To avoid this difficulty the court convicted Kaufman who was president of the Daisy Shirt Company, and as such had concealed part of its assets in bankruptcy, of aiding and abetting the corporation in violation of section 332 of the United States Penal Code relative to accessories.

In Cohen v. United States'08 the court evaded the same difficulty by con- victing Cohen, the president-manager and majority stockholder of a bankrupt corporation, of conspiracy109 with the corporation to violate section 29 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.ll0 The justice of the re- sult reached in these two cases under the Bankruptcy Act will scarcely be questioned; but it is regrettable that the faulty draftsmanship of the Act should drive government counsel and the courts to the use of such arbitrary analysis in order to accomplish an end that doubtless the pious wishes of the framers originally intended their draft to cover.1l United States v. Winslow1,2 is contrary to the conclusion of the Cohen case insofar as it denies the power of the government to con- vict for a conspiracy in lieu of the original offense. The Elkins Act had abolished imprisonment as a penalty for violation of statutes relat- ing to interstate commerce1l3 and inasmuch as imprisonment was a pun- ishment for conspiracy under the United States Penal Code, the code provision was held inapplicable. The court did not favor the concep- tion that the acts of giving and receiving rebates could constitute two crimes, one a violation of the Elkins Act and the other a violation of the Penal Code: 108157 Fed. 651 (C.

Southern Railway Co.116 The preceding discussion completes the analysis of the cases arising under what may be termed the unwritten or common law phases of vicarious corporate criminal liability. There remains for subsequent consideration the imposition of such liability and attempts to compel its stricter enforcement through legislation, together with the constitutional aspects of such legislation.
