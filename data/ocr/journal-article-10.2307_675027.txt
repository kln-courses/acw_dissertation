<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Implications of Medical Beliefs and Practices for Social Anthropology ALLAN YOUNG Case Western Reserve University A people's medical beliefs and practices persist because they answer instrumental and moral imperatives, and they are empirically effective. This is not the same thing as saying that they are effective from the standpoint of Western medical notions or that they always bring the results for which people hope. The empirical effectiveness of these practices has important ontological consequences, since it enables sickness episodes to communicate and confirm ideas about the real world. ANTHROPOLOGISTS have explored medical interests from two general points of view. The first focuses on how the epidemiology of disease is affected by traditional medical practices and by particular social and ecological settings (see Fabrega 1972:196-206). In this article I limit myself to the second approach, which aims to understand what medical beliefs and behavior mean for the people who hold and perform them. Put briefly, my argument will be this: (1) People maintain their medical traditions because they affect undesirable biological states in expected ways, and because they are effective ways for dealing with disruptive events that cannot be allowed to persist. (2) A consequence of these meanings is that some kinds of sickness episodes also perform an ontological role-communicating and confirming important ideas about the real world-analogous to the one which Durkheim (1915:387), Geertz (1966:29-34), Turner (1967:27-29), and others have attributed to religious belief and ritual. OBSTACLES TO INTERPRETING MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES The majority of works which have described what medical beliefs and practices mean for the people who hold and perform them have focused on phenomena (such as witchcraft, sorcery, and possession) that are closely tied to sickness episodes. With notable exceptions (e.g., Turner 1964, 1968; Spiro 1967; Harwood 1970; Crapanzano 1973), these studies deal with medical traditions anecdotally and as dependent variables in order to understand some other conceptual category. Little attempt is made to fit the chosen ailments into a more comprehensive matrix of diagnostic and therapeutic classifications and techniques, and so the reader remains ignorant of what alternative diagnoses and therapies the medical system permits for labeling this combination of signs, what other sorts of socially important outcomes are latent in it, and what are the rules by which rival diagnoses are contested and how they can be manipulated during the course of a sickness episode. Disease episodes are either described in ways that render their courses inevitable and their meanings un- ambiguous, or they are so cursorily given that it is difficult to get an idea of what, from an emically medical point of view, is going on (e.g., Lewis 1969:198, 208, 211-213). Submitted for publication June 10, 1975 Accepted for publication August 11, 1975 5</page><page sequence="2">6 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 A second obstacle is the misapplication of the Western medical paradigm. The interests of sick people, curers, and people who worry that they may become sick are dominated by a medical paradigm.' This means that they frame their questions and organize their behavior in order to identify, remove, arrest, alleviate, or prevent the disease symptoms that have intruded or threaten to intrude into everyday life. In brief, their interests focus on the efficacy of medical beliefs and practices. Because a people's beliefs and practices about prophylaxis, diagnosis, and therapy constitute the greatest part of any society's efforts to understand and deal with sickness, they must be the indispensable materia prima of the anthropologist who wants to study sickness. Some researchers go beyond an interest in the medical paradigm of the society they want to study, however, and see the Western or "scientific" paradigm as a universally useful means for analyzing what people are doing about sickness. One disadvantage of making this assumption is that it encourages analysts to deal with their medical subjects in a fragmentary way, to choose according to the classifications and dominant interests set by the Western paradigm. Often, this takes the shape of investigating the effectiveness of certain widespread therapeutic techniques, as in studies of "primitive psychotherapy" (e.g., Kiev 1968, 1973; Holland and Tharp 1964). Another limitation is that while the Western paradigm can explain why people hold beliefs and practices which it judges to be efficacious, the paradigm cannot explain why other sorts of beliefs and practices should persist (e.g., Hsu 1955; Seijas 1973). This, as I shall try to show, is because it misconceives the empirical character of these latter beliefs and practices (cf. Erasmus 1961:22-23, 31-56, 276, on the notion of "frequency interpretation," and Alland 1970:124-132, 183-187, on the cybernetic interpretation of "good" and "bad" theories). How can the field of interest be defined without the Western medical paradigm? Although it is reasonable enough to say that beliefs and behavior can be defined as "medical" when they somehow refer to sickness, if we leave the matter here we also leave our assumptions about sickness implicit. The question which should be asked is: What, precisely, does "sickness" mean? The everyday definition of the word will not do, since it has evolved out of the practical traditions of the Western healing arts and has taken its form within the institutional framework of the Western medical profession. What is needed is a concept of sickness that is consistent with the sorts of analytical concepts with which anthropologists study other institutions or ethnographic categories.2 It should be useful for cross-cultural comparisons and it should deal with facts that are examples of social behavior. While it is not possible to define sickness concisely at this point in my argument, it will be helpful to set down the main assumptions on which it will be based. (1) It is the social uniqueness of the sick person that sets medical beliefs and practices off from other institutions or ethnographic categories. (2) "Sickness" is the socially recognized behavior of sick people, and anthropologists can study it without invoking causes (particularly biophysical ones) that lie beyond the bounds of culture. (3) For the anthropologist, sickness can be conceptualized most usefully as a kind of behavior which would be socially unacceptable (because it involves withdrawal or threatened withdrawal from customary responsibilities) if it were not that some means of exculpation is always provided. Exculpation usually takes place through notions of biophysical determinism (see Fabrega 1970a:395-397; Evans-Pritchard 1956:99-100, 103-105, 177-196, 222; Middleton 1960:79-80 for instances where biophysical determinism is not emphasized), sometimes through the actions of agencies which are external to the sick person, but always by some mechanism which removes or distances the responsibility for the sick person's behavior from his volition.3 In the next two sections, I suggest that in order to explain why people hold and perform their particular medical beliefs and practices, one must begin with the motives of sick persons and other interested people. When we do this, we observe that they are responding to a</page><page sequence="3">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 7 combination of two imperatives. The first is a practical or instrumental one, the need to favorably change or prevent an undesirable state, sickness. They utilize their medical practices because the practices are empirically effective. I try to show that this is not the same thing as saying that (1) the practices are effective from the standpoint of Western medical notions or that (2) the practices always bring the results (e.g., remissions of symptoms) for which the people themselves hope. Because practical explanations of this sort can give only categorical explanations (that is, why a particular people hold onto a particular class of beliefs), the article then moves on to study the social imperative for maintaining these beliefs and practices. PRACTICAL EXPLANATIONS Practical explanations answer questions about how medical beliefs and practices work, how they change a sick man's condition to some more desirable state. The Western medical paradigm tells why a physician or a scientist believes that certain medical practices work. But this is only one kind of practical explanation, and I hope to show that often it is irrelevant for understanding practical explanations made by people who are unfamiliar with the Western paradigm. Before these other kinds of practical explanations can be explored, the meaning of "work" must be made clear. In practical explanations, "work" means the ability to purposively affect the real world in some observable way, to bring about the kinds of results which the actors anticipate will be brought about. On the one hand, it can mean what people hope will happen, what should happen. On the other hand, "work" can also mean what people expect will happen, what will happen regardless of whether or not the sick person's situation has been improved by the healer's activities. Although hopes and expectations exist alongside of one another whenever a therapy or prophylaxis is performed, they are independent of one another in an important way. A cure sometimes works in the sense of fulfilling the hopes or medical goals of the sick person and his kin; it sometimes restores the sick person to a condition of improved health. However, not even the most expert healer, someone known to possess an efficacious therapy for an ailment that he can correctly diagnose, is expected to be able to control all pathogenic and biophysical conditions that can possibly affect the sick person during the disease episode. Moreover, some therapies are known to be effective in only a minority of the episodes for which they are believed to be relevant. On the other hand, an established cure is always able to work in the sense that it meets the expectations of the sick person and his kin, that it produces certain results in a predictable way. (Of course, an unskilled healer may fail in this second sense, too.) An illustration of this is how the Amhara (of highland Ethiopia) treat an ailment known as setir (which includes the complaints we call "water on the knee" and "sprains in the area of the knee"). From the Amhara's point of view, the ailment is produced when blood collects in the area of the knee, then becomes stagnant and thick, and distorts the alignment of the cords (jimat: a term that subsumes veins, arteries, tendons, and ligaments) by means of which the limbs are moved during ordinary activity. Setir is usually treated by means of a therapeutic massage (to restore cords to their proper places) and bleeding (to draw off the intrusive blood that forced the cords out of place). During the therapeutic operation, three hornfuls of blood are cupped and poured into a basin already partially filled with water, and after the operation is over the healer inspects the basin for evidence of the stagnant blood that was responsible for the ailment. (According to Western medical science, the "stagnant blood" that the healer discovers in his basin is really coagulated blood; given the way in which he collects and stores it, it is inevitable that it will coagulate.) Setir therapy sometimes works in the sense that the sick person rapidly improves and becomes fully ambulatory, but the therapy always works in the sense that it produces the dark blood which the sick person, his kin, and the healer expect.</page><page sequence="4">8 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 An important limitation of the Western medical paradigm when it is used to explain non-Western medical traditions is that it uses only one sense of "work"-the achievement of hoped-for results. Yet, it is impossible to understand many of the disease concepts of these medical systems without also taking into account the second sense of work. Therapies are not only a means for curing sickness but, equally important, they are a means by which specific, named kinds of sickness are defined and given culturally recognizable forms. Most ailments are known through a combination of signs that includes both those that arise "spontaneously" out of the sick person's condition and the biophysical signs that healers manage to elicit during the course of the sickness episode. Setir, for example, is understood and objectified not only by the sick person's behavior and his verbal descriptions of his pain, but also by the stagnant blood that is produced by the cupper.4 Even if we choose to focus on questions of how well traditional medical practices achieve hoped-for results, the Western medical paradigm is still an often unreliable guide. By substituting the judgment of the physician or scientist for the judgment of the actors, the paradigm leads one to suppose that traditional practices fulfill people's medical goals less often than they do in the real world. What I have in mind here are sickness episodes in which the sick person is restored to health, even though Western medical science tells us that the therapies which were used could have played no positive medical role.s According to the Western paradigm, these episodes are examples of acute and self-limiting diseases, transient symptoms, or etiological mistakes. Acute self-limiting ailments run characteristically brief courses that end with either a complete remission of symptoms or the death of the sick person. Unless a scientifically effective therapy is used, what the outcome will be in any particular episode depends mainly on the sick person's constitution and the virulence of the pathogenic agency that afflicts him. Influenza and cholera are examples of self-limiting sicknesses. These ailments contrast with chronic ones (such as rheumatoid complaints), progressive diseases (such as leprosy) and sicknesses where mortality approaches or reaches one hundred percent (such as rabies). Transient symptoms are mainly associated with certain parasite-caused ailments. For example, during the first five or six months of schistosomiasis infection, the cercariae travel from the site of infection to the host's heart and lungs, later on to the gut, kidneys, bladder, and often to other organs. As each organ is reached, particular symptoms are produced-a bothersome skin inflammation; an asthma-like condition; abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and fever; abnormal urination. As the parasites move on, each set of symptoms disappears. While the Western paradigm describes the sequence of symptoms as expressions of a single syndrome, traditional nosologies are likely to regard each set of symptoms as an etiologically discrete sickness (Nissimov 1966; see also Fabrega 1970a:406). Since it seems that in most societies episodes of sickness, particularly those involving emically-defined serious ailments, include some sort of medical intervention (although not necessarily in the form of medicaments), it is difficult for people to appreciate either the self-limiting character of certain diseases or the transience of certain symptoms. In these circumstances, it is reasonable for people to trace the remission of disease symptoms to their medical practices. The proportion of successful cures is further improved by the practice of traditional healers (at least expert healers) in some societies of refusing to treat cases where they believe the prognosis is particularly unfavorable (e.g., Fabrega 1970a:400, 403; Neumann et al. 1971:141; Jansen 1973:140). Episodes which include "etiological mistakes" work in a similar way. From the point of view of the Western medical paradigm, etiological mistakes occur when people confound an innocent agency with one which medical science knows to be pathogenic. Here, both agencies, which are often emically indistinguishable from one another, are believed to be equally able to cause the same ailment. Since therapy tends to follow with either sort of etiological event, credit is given to the efficacy of the therapy when the sick person fails to</page><page sequence="5">Young ] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 9 develop the disease symptoms, or at least serious symptoms. For example, Amhara use the disease name "bad dog disease" to identify the ailment we call "rabies." Although this disease is nosologically (i.e., according to its symptoms) identical to rabies, etiologically (i.e., according to its causes) it is not. The onset of this ailment is traced to the bite of a "bad" dog, or even to contact with its saliva. The Amhara's "mistake" is to label as bad any dog that froths, bites without provocation, and acts in an erratic and uncontrollable way, because only a minority of such animals are rabid. However, since the dog is killed if it can be caught, there is no way that Amhara can observe the two different kinds of disease episodes that affect these dogs. Consequently, Amhara's therapy "cures" in most episodes of this ailment, since in most episodes the sick person is bitten by a nonrabid dog. What people get during sickness episodes, then, are medical proofs consistent with their expectations. Of course, this does not answer the question of how people can reconcile their assumptions about sickness and healing with instances where their therapies fail to cure or their prophylaxes fail to prevent. This is a point that has interested anthropologists for a long time, from James Frazer's conceptualization of the magician as a scientist manqu6 to Robin Horton's comparison of African magic with Western science (Horton 1967). The line of reasoning I shall follow is that people rarely see a failure to cure as challenging their assumptions about their medical system or the cosmological ideas to which it is bound. Either they ignore the ostensible conflicts by deferring to make any judgments that are not immediate and pragmatic, or they believe that these failures conform with rather than challenge those assumptions. An explanation of how people can ignore the challenge posed by empirical failure lies in making a distinction between "systematizing thinking" and "everyday thinking." (See Schutz 1962:229-234 on the differences between scientific thinking and everyday thinking; also Berger and Luckmann 1966:22-28, 65, 77-79, 110-111.) Systematizing thinking consciously strives for coherence. Its goal is to construct a system of ideas in which the existence of one concept does not contradict the existence of any related concepts. It is concerned with making consistent what its assumptions and premises say or predict about the real world with what actually happens. It can be either rigorously logical or merely seek some sort of coherence, but its interests are always with understanding an entire domain of phenomena and it is only incidentally interested in explaining particular cases. Systematizing thought, in the way in which I have just described it, tends to be restricted to categories of culturally defined specialists, and they tend to confine their use of it to the phenomenolog- ical domains that constitute their professional interests. Precisely how such a specialization will be institutionalized in a society and what will be its phenomenological domain-whether it will be cosmology, pathology, or sociology, for example-varies greatly from society to society. Indeed, whether every society has any specialists in this sense cannot be assumed. Systematizing thinking may be a necessary condition for gaining technological mastery within the chosen domain, or it may be a cognitive style (Schutz 1962:230) associated with the kinds of people who are recruited to the specialization. Beyond these limits, it tends to be rare, and in its place we find everyday thinking. Everyday thinking is occupied with the contingent and the pragmatic. It focuses on the conditions that affect, or may in the future affect, the thinker's life, and it reduces the thinker's interest to influencing these conditions in some way. Everyday thinking is not marked by a conscious striving for consistency beyond the circumstances into which the thinker's everyday activities and concerns take him. In everyday thinking, what the Western paradigm calls empirical failures are interpreted in a practical and particularistic context rather than as a test of a particular medical system. For the layman who actually participate, in the sickness episode, a failed therapy may be thought important because it offer, diagnostic information that points to a more efficacious sort of therapy and a more appropriate category of healer (e.g., Lieban 1967:121).</page><page sequence="6">10 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 None of this is to say that everyday thinking is incapable of recognizing the contradictions, or at least the ambiguities, in the way that medical beliefs and practices work in the real world. But there is a variety of reasons why this does not lead to undermining the assumptions of the conceptual system. The layman's lack of motives for pursuing such questions is perhaps the most common reason. In many societies, a second reason is that the layman is ready to assume that the contradictions that he observes are apparent and not real, that they are the product of his own faulty and incomplete knowledge, and that in the mind of the expert they can be satisfactorily explained away (cf. Barnes 1969:97, 1974:64). The layman's willingness to defer to the understanding of the specialists is possible only in societies where a significant amount of medical knowledge relating to serious sickness can be called esoteric (that is, the secret or privileged understanding of special people), and where the owners of esoteric knowledge are able to demonstrate their uncommon medical powers. From a sociological standpoint, the most important barrier to lay access to esoteric knowledge is the professionalization of knowledge. This happens when specialists are able to set and maintain their own conditions for selecting, training, and initiating new specialists, and when they can set and enforce their own standards of conduct for established specialists. From the standpoint of the layman, the inaccessibility of esoteric knowledge is most likely to be attributed to the facts that (1) it is too recondite and complex for him to grasp; (2) it is dangerous to obtain or possess because it is associated with pathogenic and/or morally proscribed forces; (3) there are no regular and acceptable ways for a layman to make his interests known to a potential donor, for price setting to take place, for the information to be efficiently transferred, or for the donor's claims about his information to be validated to the purchaser's satisfaction (e.g., Spiro 1967:29, 230-231, 235, 241; Young 1975a). In traditional society, everyday thinking as a way of understanding medical beliefs and practices is usually complemented by what has been called an "uncritical" attitude to the assumptions of the conceptual system (see Horton 1967:155-187; Polanyi 1958:286-294). An important reason for this attitude is that the assumptions are unchallenged by rival medical beliefs and practices. Now, the absence of rival medical systems does not necessarily mean the absence of other medical systems. If we are willing to define a medical system according to the uniqueness of its beliefs and practices (or more simply still, the uniqueness of its etiologies), we can find many societies in which more than one system is operating. The coexistence of Ayurvedic, Unani, and Western systems in India is a ready example, but tribal societies that have been influenced by incursive Western and Islamic systems would fit here just as well. When we study these assorted beliefs and practices as people actually use and understand them, it becomes apparent that in general it is not competition or contradiction that is occurring, but either "assimilation" or "particularization." Assimilation refers to instances where people utilize certain alien medical practices, but to the extent that they are knowledgeable about alien medical beliefs they tend to assimilate these to homologous notions in their own medical system (e.g., Lieban 1967:95-96; Leslie 1973:226-229; cf. Fabrega 1971a:39-40; Jansen 1973:83). Particularization occurs in three ways. (1) People believe that the alien medical system generates true etiologies, but that these etiologies can only account for "new" sicknesses and not for any already incorporated into their folk system (e.g., Cassell 1955:31; Lieban 1967:96-97; Neumann et al. 1971:141). (2) People believe that some of the practices of an alien system are effective, but only against (a) symptomatic complaints (since complete cures require the elimination of causal agents and only traditional measures are effective for this [e.g., Nash 1967:136, 139; Gonzalez 1966:125; Tenzel 1970:379]) or (b) a single category of symptomatically defined sickness (see Gould's distinction between "critical incapacitating dysfunctions" and "chronic non-incapacitating dysfunctions" [Gould 1957; also Leslie 1973:239]). (3) People believe that another medical system generates etiologies that are empirically true, but they are relevant only to certain categories of people. A common setting for this sort of</page><page sequence="7">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 11 particularization is a possession cult whose members are bound to sickness-causing spirits which are distinct from the spirits charged with upholding the dominant moral order. Such possession cults tend to recruit their members only from certain segments of society. For these people the cult grows to displace the importance that orthodox medical beliefs and practices held in their lives before the cult spirits forced them to undergo initiation (Lewis 1971:32, 118-126). Assimilation and particularization are complementary ways of dealing with other medical systems. For example, while outsiders to the Amhara zar cult particu- larize its beliefs and practices, at the same time they are ready to assimilate the divinatory powers of cult shamans into their own medical system (cf. Barnes 1969:97-101). Now for the final point of this argument. Even when people apprehend that therapies and prophylaxes often fail to cure or prevent sickness, even when they choose neither to ignore the implications of the failure nor to defer its meaning to the understanding of specialists, there are common reasons why their assumptions remain unchallenged. I shall limit my discussion to serious ailments against which therapies often fail (excluding minor ailments, ailments with mortality or chronicity approaching 100%, and ailments against which tradi- tional cures are significantly efficacious). I want to make the following point: While scientific criteria of proof demand more than mere plausibility, in traditional medical sys- tems the condition of plausibility-that one can assume to be true any explanation that cannot be proven false-seems to be sufficient. Part of the plausibility results from a tendency to trace serious ailments to purposive and often anthropomorphic agents, which (1) often choose their victims according to moral and social criteria rather than universalistic biophysical ones, and (2) generally fail to conform with what is called in logic the "law of non-contradiction" (see Cooper 1973). In scientifically framed etiologies, we argue that if we define an object as "A," it cannot be "A" and "not A" at the same time. If it is a virus, then it can be neither a bacterium nor an amoeba. But in folk systems, such clear-cut distinctions are often impossible because causal agencies can appear in many, sometimes unpredictable, guises, including some that are ordinarily considered to be innocent or ac- cidental. In addition to being polymorphous and able to work through objects which are ordinarily unconnected with sickness, frequently disease agents in folk systems can cause a wide variety of symptomatic complaints. There is a vagueness and indeterminancy about this that resists the sort of analytical reasoning with which the scientific empiricist prefers to work. It is precisely this indeterminancy that calls attention to my main point. Under the circumstances I have outlined, the only way that sickness episodes can be understood is to argue from the individual episode and after the fact. Because these disease agents are also purposive and anthropomorphic, because they are interested in who people are and how they behave, the plausibility of etiologies often hinges on whether or not good reasons can be found to explain why this causal agent chose this sick person (e.g., Marshal 1969:379). "The con- ceptual system, by virtue of the fact that it contains so many contradictions in the abstract, provides the possibility of finding a solution to any eventuality in accordance with the ex post facto logic .... In a word, the conceptual system becomes as a whole 'systematic' only in the context of action ... " (Pitt-Rivers 1970:194; see also Barnes 1974:62). Not only do traditional medical systems make plausible explanations when they are needed, they also provide empirical proofs in support of these explanations. Indeed, from a practical point of view, an explanation can be considered true only if it can be demonstrated to be true. Here, I want to observe that proofs which are consistent with people's expecta- tions come about in two ways. About one way, I have already written: Therapies are able to produce expected signs, whether or not they actually produce a cure. To this, we can now add a second way, which, although not universal, seems to be widespread. Often in the case of the mainly serious, self-limiting diseases, proofs follow as the inevitable product of a common set of premises: (1) All episodes end in a way that can be explained by weighing</page><page sequence="8">12 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 the balance of forces (therapeutic and pathogenic) exercised during the course of the episode. (2) The power of entire classes of pathogenic agents or entire classes of healers is not assumed to be homogeneous. That is, some spirits are more powerful, or at least more vicious or determined, than are others, just as some healers may have more formidable recipes or more helpful familiars than do others. (3) The relative power of a specific healer cannot be learned before the fact, but only contingently, as it engages the powers of a particular pathogenic agent (e.g., Ozturk 1964:350-351, 353-354, 360-361). In a less com- mon variety of this calculus, the power to affect people's well-being is undifferentiated, and the same sources of power can be used to sicken as well as to heal. So, for example, while spirit familiars can cause maladies, they also can be persuaded to restrain other spirits of the same sort from causing sickness, as long as it is they who are the more powerful. A man who is a healer in one sickness episode may be a sorcerer in another. So long as sorcery is bought and performed secretly, a sickness episode can only reveal the relative power of the sorcerer, but not his identity. If the sick person recovers, it means that the sorcerer was the weaker of the two; if he fails to get better, his healer was the weaker. In these circumstances, predic- tion is impossible and no matter what the outcome is it can only confirm the premises of these medical beliefs (e.g., Pitt-Rivers 1970:184, 191; Thomas 1971:177-192; Spiro 1967:29, 235; Dawson 1964:331-334, 327-328). While practical explanations are necessary for understanding medical beliefs and practices, they can only make categorical explanations. They can explain why people continue with a class of beliefs and practices, but they cannot tell why the members of a specific society hold to a particular medical practice or a particular medical belief. This is most obvious when we turn to "redundant" beliefs and practices-that is, alternative ways of explaining or dealing with what from the standpoint of the Western medical paradigm we should describe as a single ailment. In order to understand specific medical beliefs and practices, it is necessary to move onto social explanations. SOCIAL EXPLANATIONS The socially destructive consequences of sickness are obvious enough. People are struck down from established networks of social relations and society is challenged to run on in an orderly and predictable way. But sickness episodes may also contribute to the orderliness of social life, since they are a useful vehicle for communicating and legitimizing changes in how social relations are distributed within a community. A good example of this occurs in those matrilineal societies of Central Africa, such as the Ndembu, Cewa, and Yao, which lack specialized legal forums that are capable of deciding issues rising out of intracommunity factionalism. Here, episodes involving serious ailments that can be traced to sickness-causing humans often serve as a means for resolving these situations. This they do by allocating a morally stigmatizing identity ("witch") onto the shoulders of one of the principals, and in this way spoil the legitimacy of his claims (see Gluckman 1972b). The events surrounding the diagnosis of the syndrome that leads to the witchcraft accusation are particularly interesting, since the critical syndrome does not have to implicate a witch, but can be traced likewise to socially less significant causal agents. Further, it seems, such a syndrome can usually be referred to categories of diagnosticians and diagnostic techniques which differ from one another regarding the sorts of etiologies they can work, or at least regarding the sorts they are likely to favor, and some of these are more likely to find witches as causal agents than are others. Thus, the choice to diagnose with one of these healers or techniques, instead of some other possible one, means that the episode is going to be played within one particular set of limits and not some other. A particular set of social stakes can be competed for rather than a higher or lower set, a particular sort of social issue can be raised but others cannot, and one kind of venue and audience and not another can legitimize the outcome. In</page><page sequence="9">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 13 these circumstances, then, the diagnosis of likely syndromes performs in a way that is analogous to the procedures of official inquests, magistrates' courts, and grand juries in our society (see Park 1963).6 There are four special characteristics of sickness episodes that allow them to be used in this way. (1) The epidemiological characteristics of sickness episodes make them useful, since within any community sickness is always occurring and it is indiscriminate in that it affects people of all social categories. (2) The onset of sickness brings with it two important moral imperatives. (a) People find it morally necessary (and not simply optional) to initiate or participate in sickness episodes once the sick person has been identified as being sick. (b) In the course of constructing disease etiologies during sickness episodes, people are compelled to reflect on certain aspects of the social order for which no alternative model-abstract or "sociological"--exists (see Gluckman 1972a:xvi). Precisely what sorts of social relations and behavior they will turn to examine at this time varies from society to society, and within any society it varies from ailment to ailment. (3) The sick person and his curer construct an etiology so that it is consistent with events, including socially important ones, that took place prior to the ailment's appearance. Etiologies are usually worked into narratives that are able to transmit social facts which, although often elaborate, can be easily understood (because etiologies have highly conventionalized formats and simple codes) and easily transmitted (because of the institutionalized settings in which etiologies are "read"). Etiologies are analytical, since they pick out certain facts and reject others as irrelevant, and then go on to indicate the kinds of relations that held between these facts, especially causal relations and socially prescribed or "ideal" relations. In some respects, then, etiologies of this sort share an affinity with socially important myths, since they "lock a set of circumstances in an original set of events... [and, so,] provide a point of reference in the past beyond which one need not go" (Cohen 1969:350; see also Levi-Strauss 1963:199). (4) Episodes of acute sickness have many of the characteristics of contests, and, so, they are convenient mechanisms for making the kinds of decisions that I have discussed. They are episodic, their possible outcomes are clear-cut, they are played according to highly conventionalized rules, and generally their outcome cannot be predicted before the episode is played out. Now, I shall examine these points in greater detail. I begin with the observation that sickness episodes are marked by strong social pressure on the sick person (or his proxy) to do something about his sickness. In order to understand this point, it is first necessary to have a satisfactory conceptualization of the condition around which the episode takes place-sickness. Why not a biophysical definition of sickness, then? Briefly stated, a biophysical definition implies the following: (1) In order to understand a people's notion of disease (particularly the arrangement of symptoms into syndromes) we must root our analysis in a biophysical reality of predictable causes and effects; these biophysical causes dominate over culturally patterned and socially meaningful performances in giving shape to behavior in sickness episodes. (2) The concepts and classifications of Western medical science are sufficient for understanding the biophysical aspects of sickness. In order for an anthropologist to talk about sickness as a biophysical condition, he must have a satisfactory technical vocabulary, and, in lieu of a satisfactory rival body of concepts, he must rely on the usages of Western medicine. But we already have reason to suspect that these usages and notions will not enable us to explain the persistence of particular medical traditions in a chosen society. While Western medicine's legitimate claims to scientific status go far beyond those of any other medical system, from the point of view of the social scientist, these claims are still insufficient and often irrelevant. Measured by scientific standards of verifiability, "modern medicine constitutes an extremely heterogeneous collection of illnesses, from.. . complaints directly connected to an infectious microorganism at one extreme, to such things as 'mental illness' on the other" (Freidson 1970:206). It is questionable whether the scientific or culture-free</page><page sequence="10">14 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 claims of Western medicine are equally valid for all of these ailments (Fabrega 1972:213; Nurge 1958:1170). Barnes takes this point further still. The claim is generally made that because scientific explanation is faithful to conventions of falsifiability and consistency between theory and evidence, it is ontologically distinct from explanations made by folk systems. Barnes argues cogently that, in practice, neither convention circumscribes scientific activity. What does make science unique (but not ontologically distinct) is its a priori opposition to teleological argument and anthropomorphic agency (Barnes 1974:22-48, 62, 92, 117, 126). Nor, for several reasons, is our concern simply that what constitutes a specific syndrome in a folk nosology may find no real counterpart in Western medicine. What constitutes a specific symptomatic complaint in the West ("pain" or "nausea," for example) may only roughly approximate an analogous symptomatic category elsewhere (see, for example, Mechanic 1968:125-126 for a review of studies dealing with the symptomatic significance of pain for various ethnic populations in the United States; also see Wolff and Langley 1968). The approximation may be sufficient in some analytical contexts, but it can never be ignored. In "physical" illnesses as well as "mental" ones, symptoms are shaped in ways that cannot be explained by biophysical causes. In Western society, as in traditional ones, the sick person learns to perform this "superfluous" or "subjective" (including the verbalization of internal organic sensations) symptomatic behavior in the same way that he acquires his knowledge of the behavior that his society judges appropriate to other social identities. Often, it is precisely this information on which the curer must depend if he is going to make sense out of his client's other signs (see Fabrega 1970b:308, 312, 313). Moreover, we cannot afford to ignore "the curiously variable response of the human body to the ostensibly objective world of physical and chemical stimuli" (Freidson 1970:211-212, 262; see also Mechanic 1968:ch. 4). This last caution is especially pertinent in instances-frequent enough in the preindustrial societies which anthropologists have traditionally studied-where the sick person already carries a burden of parasite-caused ailments that vastly complicate the symptomatic picture. If we follow this argument to its conclusion, it means that we are constrained only to conceptualize sickness as behavior that is believed to have biophysical causes (see Freidson 1970:211-212; Begelman 1971:48-54). The important point here is that if we want to learn the social meaning of sickness, we must understand that "signs," whatever their genesis, become "symptoms" because they are expressed, elicited, and perceived in socially acquired ways. But once the biophysical meaning of the sick person's syndrome is gone from our definition, what remains behind to mark his behavior as unique? My answer begins with Talcott Parsons' observation that sickness can be studied as a type of deviant behavior (see note 3; also see Alland 1970:16-17). That is to say, sick persons are people (but by no means all people) who abstain from important everyday responsibilities that they are expected to meet, or at least threaten to abstain from them. The more "serious" is the sickness, the greater is the deviance. What distinguishes sickness from other kinds of deviant behavior are the special techniques by which society offers to exculpate the sick person, and the fact that social accountability for his behavior can always be trans- ferred onto some agency beyond the sick person's will. These agencies can be in some sense external to the sick person (a witch or a virus, perhaps), within his own body (a morbid physiological process, for example), or, most often, a combination of both. Indeed, recognizing that sickness roles (at least those that involve serious sickness) and ritual behavior are distinguished from everyday behavior in many of the same ways, it would be more appropriate to label them extra-ordinary than deviant. Since the process of exculpation is fundamental to my definition of sickness, it will be useful to elaborate exactly what I mean by this term. The exculpation of people who are subsequently called "sick" is never automatic. Moreover, the transfer of accountability that</page><page sequence="11">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 15 marks the exculpation must take place under socially prescribed conditions if it is to be adequately communicated and legitimized. These special conditions are the stereotyped sets of behavior we know as "diagnosis" and "therapy" according to the Western medical model. To transfer accountability means to translate "sign" (behavioral or biophysical expressions of the sick person) into "symptom" (recognizable indicators of sickness). (See, for example, Zola 1966 for a discussion of the different values that may be given to a variety of complaints, including diarrhea, coughing, trachoma, and fatigue; Fabrega and Manning 1972:243-244, 255 on the notion of "health maintenance"; Clark 1959:203 on the validation of claims by the sick person's associates.) It sometimes happens that a society explains some category of deviant behavior by tracing it to biophysical causes, but even so refuses to label it as "sickness" or to treat its bearer as a sick person. Examples here are witches of the Zande type and certain sociopaths in our society. Each of these deviants suffers from an inability to control his behavior, an inability that people trace to a biophysical peculiarity. The witch is born with a special witching organ or aspect, and the kind of sociopath I am talking about is born with an abnormal (XYY) karyotype (see Hook 1973). Yet society holds both accountable for their behavior (see Aubert and Messinger 1958). A similar sort of forbidden exculpation found in Western society concerns episodes described as "psychosomatic" in origin. While a convincing array of signs appears, the individual is not allowed to pass on responsibility for producing them. Of course, if the sufferer of such complaints produces behavior that is aberrant enough and persists in it long enough, he may gain exculpation anyway. Even so, the translation of signs may not be the one which he intended. Generally speaking, physicians in the United States tend to be permissive about translating signs into symptoms and granting exculpation (cf. McKinlay 1972:567-570). When faced with a diagnosis for which he has equally convincing reasons to believe that either his client is sick or he is not sick, the physician finds that the professional and legal risks are less if he accepts the hypothesis of sickness (see Scheff 1963). As we saw in the last section, once treatment has been administered it is anyway more likely that both he and his client will attribute the latter's good health to a therapy that has worked (e.g., Rosenhan 1973:252-254). But what if the healer's institutional interest were changed, what effect would this have on the kinds of translations being made? Arlene Daniels' study of military psychiatry is particularly interesting on this point, since U.S. Army Medical Corps psychiatrists tend to reverse the bias. To be "on the safe side" here means avoiding the risk of exculpating without true cause; "when in doubt, diagnose as healthy, recommend a 'further trial of duty' " (Daniels 1972:148-151). Mark Field (1953:923-924) makes an analogous point by tracing a link between the increasing reluctance of Soviet physicians to diagnose factory workers as sick and the promulgation of a series of decrees, beginning in the 1930s, which were intended to increase the productivity of Soviet industry by reducing absenteeism. The power of healers (diagnosticians as well as therapists) has two aspects, then. One is practical and the other is social. The first refers to power accumulated and controlled by the healer in order to compete with pathogenic agencies, so that he can produce a remission of symptoms (see Glick 1967; Jansen 1973:139-140). This aspect can be measured according to how powerful are the pathogenic agencies that must be countered (that is, the seriousness of the symptoms they produce and their ability to resist therapies), and how common these prophylactic, diagnostic, or therapeutic abilities are in a particular society. The social aspect of power refers to someone's ability to communicate and legitimize his choice of exculpating circumstances. This aspect of power can be measured according to the seriousness of the social consequences of exculpation for the sick person and other principals in the episode. The two aspects of power are closely linked, since it is through diagnosis and therapy that the choice of exculpating circumstances must be communicated and legitimized. The</page><page sequence="12">16 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 relationship between the two is not necessarily direct, however, since in order to legitimize exculpation the healer need not produce a cure but need only confirm his diagnosis. In any society, who has the right to translate ailments may vary from one class of ailments to another. Sometimes, common knowledge and the opinion of the sick person and his relatives are sufficient to translate and exculpate; in other cases, these are the exclusive rights of one or another category of specialists. It is by his choice of translators that the sick person can exercise control over what sorts of translations are possible, and what sorts of audiences will be mobilized during the episode. Figure 1 describes this sequence of events.7 SYMPTOMS SIGN translation i SICK PERSON the diagnosis is tested ("therapy") the diagnosis is not confirmed the diagnosis is confirmed The person withdraws or EXCULPATION ALLOCATION OF threatens to withdraw and new customary RESPONSIBILITY from his customary responsibilities for the deviant responsibilities behavior Fig. 1. The sequence of events in sickness episodes seen from a social point of view. It will be helpful to summarize the points that have just been made about the social meaning of sickness: Sickness episodes (particularly episodes that incorporate serious-acute ailments) tend to proceed in a contest-like way. The social object of these episodes is to exculpate the curer's client by transferring the accountability for his deviant behavior onto some other person or object. A sickness episode begins when the principal and/or his relatives decide the range of symptoms into which his signs could be translated. Next, they must obtain the services of someone whose medical powers are appropriate to this range of symptoms; under certain circumstances, they may have power enough themselves to translate the signs. Their choice of a diagnostician is in a way equivalent to choosing a specific kind of contest out of a repertoire of possible contests, since the diagnostician decides what set of rules will be played, what individuals (including therapists and pathogenic agents) and audiences can be mobilized, and what sorts of social stakes will be involved. The therapist's task is to communicate and legitimize the episode's outcome, and this, too, takes place according to rules shared by sick persons, healers, and audiences (e.g., Harwood 1970:77-134). These sets of rules are encoded in the etiologies of each medical system. While etiologies and the conditions that they describe are unique for every society, they are everywhere constructed out of four kinds of information. Not every etiology uses all four kinds, and while some etiologies pack elaborate information into each category, others do not (e.g.,</page><page sequence="13">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 17 Nash 1967:139). From a medical point of view, the four categories can be described as follows: (1) There are three kinds of agencies. Causal agencies are immediately responsible for producing syndromes (e.g., poison, introjected objects, malarial amoebae). Precipitating agencies enlist or oblige the services of other agencies to produce syndromes (e.g., the sorcerer, his client, anopheles mosquitoes). Intermediating agencies are the means through which the sick person-to-be comes to the attention of, or into contact with, causal or precipitating agencies (e.g., the sick person's kinsman, where the latter's quarrel has instigated the sorcerer's client). Agencies can be animate or inanimate, corporeal or incorporeal, purposive or nonpurposive. (2) Events are occasions and environments through which the sick person-to-be comes to the notice of, or into contact with, agencies. (3) Actions are the activities of agents pursuant to producing a syndrome. The actions of precipitating agents are instrumental; actions of causal agents are efficient causes. (4) Processes are the biophysical processes within the sick person's own body that are responsible for producing syndromes. One sort of diagnostician may work with certain etiologies but not with others, although both the etiologies with which he works and those which are not in repertoire can explain the same syndromes. By choosing him rather than a rival sort of diagnostician, his clients weight the likelihood that certain kinds of events will be communicated to the audience and that other occasions and environments will not even be recognized as etiological events. The explanations I have outlined in the preceding sections have for their starting point the actor's reasons for holding to his society's medical beliefs and practices. I now turn to describe certain ontological consequences of these practical and social meanings. ONTOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES A person's sense of reality consists of two parts. There is his "model" of reality, which contrasts and connects the objects that exist in his world, and there is his conviction that these perceptions are true and extrinsic to himself. Before a model of reality can provide a sense of reality, a person must confirm it through experience: Models of reality are simultaneously "models of" and "models for" (see Geertz 1967:6-8; Goodenough 1971:36-38 on the notion of the "propriospect"; Laing 1965:51). A sense of reality means, then, imposing order through practical activity, "praxis." This is any activity which seeks to go beyond the existing situation in order to change it. In praxis, a person uses his model of reality to think about his situation and his wants in order to formulate a subjective plan. He tests the plan against the objectively existing situation in which he finds himself, and with whose objects (animate and inanimate, human and nonhuman) he must work in order to satisfy his wants. Praxis is dialectical in form; the subjective plan clashes with an external reality, and the result of this clash shapes the person's sense of reality in some way (Warnock 1965:147; also Wallace 1970:ch. 1, on "mazeways"). The relation of wants, praxis, and the consequence of praxis must not be misunderstood: the desire to satisfy wants is the motive for praxis, but praxis fulfills its ontological role whether or not the wants are actually satisfied. But what has all of this to do with our medical interests? If we reflect back on our discussion of practical explanations, it should become clear that the notion of "work" which is central to understanding the meaning of medical beliefs and behavior is, if understood from an ontological point of view, a way of describing praxis. There are several reasons why sickness episodes are ontologically important settings. (1) Episodes of serious sickness rarely lack compelling motives (wants) for action, for forcing people into praxis and for mobilizing</page><page sequence="14">18 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 audiences: On the one hand there is the medical motive of seeking a remission of symptoms, on the other hand there is the social motive of seeking exculpation for deviant behavior. (2) Sickness episodes are recurrent events and they affect all members of society.8 This is ontologically important, because no person ever learns or confirms his sense of reality in a once-and-for-all event. It must be continually recommunicated to this person and reconfirmed by him throughout his life (cf. Durkheim 1915:387). (3) Sickness episodes are able to communicate complex models in a readily recognizable way. Etiologies cast a broad net, implicating objects, qualities, and events in every aspect of life; they sort out these diverse kinds of facts, combine them into relationships that cannot be articulated in everyday contexts, and by juxtaposing ("polarizing") them with organic processes make them cognitively impressive (Sargent 1957:13-24, 52, 74, 133; Levi-Strauss 1963:200-202; Turner 1967:27-29). Finally, sickness episodes (particularly serious-acute ones) are dramaturgical in form. While praxis takes place in many different settings, action that communicates and confirms abstract sociological and cosmological ideas tends to take place (in traditional and tribal societies, at least) in dramaturgical settings. Because these ideas are communicated mainly through expressive symbols, it is also true that these symbols are used most often in such settings. As a dramaturgical event, sickness is episodic in time and focused in space; it is clearly set off from everyday life; there is a sense of audience, for participants are carefully distinguished from outsiders; participants are fit into a small number of highly stereotyped roles that are played according to a more or less fixed program (i.e., with the knowledge and acceptance of a single set of rules) on a field dense with expressive symbols; there is the expectation that events will proceed toward a climax; the episode is marked by a mood infused by extra-ordinary emotions rising out of man's profoundest fears; and it is sustained by a clearly articulated dialectic of persons and forces that lends a coherence to the world of events and experiences that is lacking or obscure in humdrum situations (Turner 1968:274; Geertz 1966:29-34; Fabrega 1972:185; Young 1975b). There are several reasons why the dramatic form in sickness episodes is more obvious in tribal and traditional societies than it is in the West. This point is worth pausing over, since it helps to clarify how sickness episodes support the ontological tasks that I have just introduced. It also helps to make the point that the sickness episode in the West is an extreme type, but by no means an unrelated one, among the sickness episodes played by the world's peoples. That is to say, while the sick person in the West cannot serve as a model for understanding how sickness is played in other societies, it would be wrong to assume that the technological gulf which separates Western medicine from traditional medicine makes it impossible to compare episodes in these different kinds of societies. (1) Social institutions in the West have tended to develop into progressively secular forms, and systematic analytic thinking has come to dominate in most aspects of social life over thinking couched in expressive symbols. (2) Technological developments in Western medicine have also had important consequences. The great advances in preventive medicine in the West and the appearance of "wonder drugs" have displaced serious-acute ailments from the position of cultural and epidemiological dominance that they previously held, and have left their place to serious-chronic ailments of less dramaturgical potential. (3) The power to articulate models of reality and to confirm them has passed out of the sick person's hands and into those of the professional healer. As Eliot Freidson has observed (1970:206), the Western medical model is built on a concept of sickness that reflects the healer's point of view. It describes sickness according to a narrow biophysical determinism that reduces the sick person's performance to mechanically determined behavior, and makes him more an object than an active participant capable of initiating action and influencing the choice of alternatives during the episode. The active and powerful healer and his passive and object-like client are symbolized in what seems to be a unique combination of ways. The</page><page sequence="15">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 19 physician demands nakedness, recumbency, unresisting access to body regions that are called "privates" in everyday life, and forbearance of the pain and discomfort which he causes-an assortment of forms that, in the West, is mainly limited to sickness episodes, the rearing of pre-adolescent children, the treatment of "unliberated" women during coitus, and the management of the populations of "total institutions." The symbolization of sickness in the West also means alienating the sick person's volition from the operations of his own body. The physician probes beneath the body's surface (and the limits of the known self), into regions whose secrets and betrayals only he can bring to the surface, and it is his choice whether this knowledge will be shared with or hidden from his client. Even the sick person's consciousness is made superfluous to the episode by the healer's diagnostic machines (such as x-rays), by his ability to deal mainly with disembodied parts of his client (such as blood and urine), and by his readiness to interpose professional deaf-mutes (technicians and nurses) between the client and himself. Finally, the healer's regime is absolute, since he leaves his client (at least middle- and upper-class ones) no place to run. Healer and client share a system of medical beliefs which both believe is universally relevant and excludes any alternative explanations of sickness, and both recognize that only the healer fully understands this system. (See Freidson 1970:315-321, 355 for a discussion of the degrees of passivity that are forced on the Western sick person by various medical specialties; also see Jansen 1973:40.) In both Western and other societies it seems that "in the face of actual or threatened disaster, to do something is psychologically satisfying and a way of relieving anxiety; anything is better than just remaining passive and waiting for it to happen" (Beattie 1964:207). But why should it be satisfying? Medical beliefs and practices can never explain away sickness or death. Why, then, when they fail to produce a cure, can it be said that they make suffering sufferable? I have argued in this section that while serious sickness is an event that challenges meaning in this world, medical beliefs and practices organize the event into an episode that gives it form and meaning. Figure 2 describes how this operation is related to practical and social processes. PRACTICAL MEANING SOCIAL MEANING ONTOLOGICAL EFFECTS diagnosis/therapy translation models of/for reality (MODE:instrumental) (MODE:etiological) (MODE:dialectical) therapy/medical outcome exculpation/al location -a-ontological confirmation Fig. 2. The relationship between practical and social meanings and their ontological consequences. Between traditional and tribal societies on the one hand and Western society on the other, there are no fundamental differences in the way in which praxis works through sickness episodes to shape these images (cf. Horton 1968). What does separate them are the different kinds of ontological orders which they affirm.9 While one works a man-centered cosmos in the grip of anthropomorphized forces, the other moves toward a conception of man autonomous in an indifferent universe (see Warnock 1965:52). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS (1) In order to explain why medical beliefs and practices persist, it is necessary to discover their practical and social meanings. The meanings become accessible if sickness</page><page sequence="16">20 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [78,1976 episodes are understood in terms of the expectations of the actors, the narrative-building character of disease etiologies, and the processual nature of cures. (2) The analysis of practical meaning focuses on the empirical (but unscientific) character of traditional medicine. This means (a) distinguishing between what people hope for from their medical traditions and what they expect from them; (b) articulating folk etiologies and cures with the natural histories of etically-defined disease categories; and (c) recognizing the processes (everyday thinking, assimilation and particularization, protean and interested agency) which make folk medical beliefs and practices both plausible and useful. (3) The analysis of social meaning focuses on the capacity of sickness to simultaneously generate a need for exculpation and a means for allocating responsibility. This means studying the way in which sickness episodes enable people to (a) connect past events into socially recognizable explanations and (b) select from alternative explanations and legitimize the choice. Not all categories of sickness are equally interesting in this regard. (4) The practical and social meanings of sickness have important ontological con- sequences which make it useful to treat certain kinds of sickness episodes as a subspecies of a class of events usually associated with ritual performances. NOTES Acknowledgments. I want to thank Charles Leslie of New York University and Aaron Katcher of the University of Pennsylvania for reading and commenting on earlier versions of this paper. 1 Paradigms of this sort answer three questions. What kinds of facts compose the chosen phenomenological domain? How are the facts related to one another and what sorts of questions can we legitimately ask about them? What techniques and apparatus can be used in seeking solutions to these questions (Kuhn 1962:x, 4-5, 59)? 2See Fabrega (1971a:40-41, 1971b:392-397) for important methodological statements on the task of conceptualizing and describing the relationships between signs, symptoms, disease classifications, and the careers of sick people. 3These assumptions are broadly consistent with Talcott Parsons' definition of the sick role. According to Parsons, a sick person is someone incapable of some task or role performance; the incapacity is beyond his control and he is not responsible for it. Sickness is different from other forms of deviance since it can be conditionally legitimized if the sick person recognizes that he is sick, wants to get well, and, so far as spontaneous forces are inadequate for a cure, seeks technically competent help and cooperates with the expert (Parsons 1951:428-447, 1958:167-177). Other sociologists have suggested modifications of Parsons' definition. For a recent review, see Mechanic (1968:33-48). The most important of the proposed changes has been Freidson's (1970:224-243). Also, see Twaddle (1973:753-757, 1974:30-32) for a comment on the consequences of Parsons' neglect of the biophysical aspect of sickness. From the point of view of the anthropologist, most of these conceptualizations have the important limitation of either disregarding or taking for granted the substantive beliefs that sick people, healers, and their communities use to explain what is happening. 4 For this reason, it is often a mistake to gloss a folk disease classification without also knowing how it is diagnosed and what are the physical effects of the therapies with which it is treated (see, for example, Jansen 1973:99). s My concern here is not with instances in which the Western paradigm has been used with insufficient ingenuity; that for example, (1) under certain circumstances folk remedies induce unexpected biophysical consequences that improve the sick person's chance to recover (see Alland 1970:118-120), or (2) we are dealing with the psychosomatic effects of placebos (e.g., Frank 1963). 6Even in the West a strong affinity persists between legal and medical events, particularly with regard to "mental illness" (see Rueschmeyer 1964; Szasz 1963). 7Cf. Kasl and Cobb's (1966:246, 248, 252-260) distinction between "illness behavior" (activity by a person who feels ill, to define the state of his health and to find a suitable remedy) and "sick role behavior" (activity by a person who considers himself ill, for the</page><page sequence="17">Young] MEDICAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 21 purpose of getting well). From the standpoint of the approach outlined in my article, this distinction would be more useful for making practical explanations than for social ones. 81 am not suggesting that sickness necessarily strikes randomly, of course. One limitation of the approach in this article is that it skirts the important question of the relationship between social differences and the incidence of particular sicknesses. 9While this scheme treats society as if it were a system in equilibrium and analyzes medical traditions in terms of their contribution to this equilibrium, sickness episodes may also be a vehicle for bringing change that results in an essentially new situation (e.g., Ingham 1970; Thomas 1970:67-68).
