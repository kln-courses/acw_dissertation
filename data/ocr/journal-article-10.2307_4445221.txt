<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE RAB- BIT, by R. M. Lockley. 1974. Macmillan Publishing Co., New York. 152 p. $6.95 (hardback). Despite the 1974 copyright, this book .is based on observations made in the 1959s and 1960s, and its first copyright date is 1964. The only new part is a two- page introduction by Richard Adams. Still, if you want to know anything about rabbits, this is the book for you to read. The subjects are not fictional Peter Cottontails or Br'er Rabbits. They are real rabbits, living the struggle of life as real rabbits must. In the words of the author, this book "attempts to give a picture of the social structure of rab- bit communities from first hand ob- servation." Naturally, to do this, the author must describe rabbit behavior under various circumstances. He takes the liberty of attributing human characteristics to the subjects of his study-thinking, wonderment, loneli- ness, love, jealousy. Despite this bit of anthropomorphism, the book is a scien- tific study, well planned and well ex- ecuted. Five rabbit-proof enclosures of vary- ing sizes and terrain were set up. The largest covered several acres of farm- land. Central to these five areas was a large elm tree with an observation blind in which the observers could watch the rabbits with telescopes. A fifth en- closure housed an underground war- ren. It butted up against the plate-glass window of a hut where the observers could sit and watch the rabbits in their burrows. Every rabbit was marked with a large tatoo and a numbered ear-tag. Males were tagged in the right ear and females in the left. Each animal could be identified readily from a distance. Lockley and his staff recorded the rise and fall of a series of rabbit dynas- ties. They observed the growth of a so- ciety, the struggle of dominance, the es- tablishment of a peck order. At the top of the social structure is the "King" buck rabbit. He controls the domain. He has a "Queen" doe rabbit as his con- sort, and perhaps a few concubines on the side. Other bucks and does step aside when he passes, allow him the best grazing and the best living quar- ters. They are allowed to live in peace, in corners of the royal domain, as satel- lites, as long as they do not challenge the king's dominance or trespass on his territory. One usually thinks of rab- bits as baby-faced, cuddly things. But Lockley describes brutal attacks, physi- cal battles to the death, biting, kicking, tearing of fur, cutting of hamstrings. One of the most significant concepts growing out of Lockley's research re- lates to overpopulation. When rabbit population becomes too great for the territory to support, the stress becomes intolerable. This is especially so for the young and the subordinate. They are hounded and threatened by the more aggressive, older, and dominant ani- mals. They fail to reproduce. Even if a female becomes pregnant, the young are likely to be resorbed before preg- nancy is half way through. This is a REVIEWS 255</page><page sequence="2">sort of natural birth control process, similar to abortion, but far less trau- matic. Naturally the starved, under- privileged rabbits are retarded in growth, subject to disease and early death. How similar this is to the hu- man world when overpopulation is ram- pant! Lockley concludes his book with a summary which he calls "The Rabbit Wild and Free." Here he reviews the re- production, life history, and social structure in a wild rabbit community. This chapter contains all you ever wanted to know about rabbits but didn't know whom to ask. After read- ing the book, one is inclined to agree with the author that, "Rabbits are so human. Or is it the other way around-humans are so rabbit." Philip Goldstein Miami, Fla.</page></plain_text>
