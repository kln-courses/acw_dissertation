INFLUENCE OF HABITAT STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY WHEN SEARCHING FOR MAMMALIAN PREY STEPHEN J. MULLIN' AND WILLIAM H. N. GUTZKE Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA ABSTRACT: The habitat in which a predator experiences the highest level of foraging success may depend on the complexity of the structure within that habitat. Visual perception of prey may increase in an open habitat where structure is absent, whereas a predator's crypsis in an ambush posture may increase in a highly complex habitat. We examined the effect of variation in habitat structural complexity on the predatory success of the semi-arboreal snake Elaphe obsoleta spiloides foraging for small mammals (Mus domesticus). Individual snakes searched for mice in large enclo- sures containing one of five levels of vegetation density. Latency to prey capture and snake behaviors were recorded on video tape for each foraging episode. Gray rat snakes were least proficient at capturing prey in enclosures devoid of vegetation, but latency to prey capture was not reliably affected by variation in the density of vegetation within the enclosures. Subjects spent over 95% of foraging time performing 10 of the 20 described behaviors; three behaviors occurred more often than the other seven regardless of variation in structural complexity of habitat. Experimental ma- nipulation of structural complexity within simulated habitats did not influence predatory success or behavioral expression in gray rat snakes foraging for small rodents. Key words: Elaphe obsoleta spiloides; Foraging behavior; Gray rat snake; Habitat simulation; Predatory success; Structural complexity VARIATION in habitat structural com- plexity may affect predatory success (re- viewed in Heck and Crowder, 1991), al- though many studies examining this phe- nomenon have been conducted only in aquatic habitats (Anderson, 1984; Vince et al., 1976) and results have not been con- sistent. The optimal level of habitat struc- tural complexity for some predatory spe- cies is an open habitat (Nelson and Bons- dorff, 1990), because the absence of veg- etation can increase the predator's probability of visually or aurally detecting prey. Conversely, foraging by other species is most successful when structure is pres- ent at a particular level (Nelson, 1979; Sav- ino and Stein, 1982), above or below which success decreases. For such species, structure may conceal their approach to prey or may serve to reduce predation risk on the predators themselves. A selected habitat may therefore reflect a compro- mise between several factors of an organ- ' PRESENT ADDRESS: Department of Biology, Uni- versity of Central Arkansas, Conway, AR 72035, USA. ism's ecology that are influenced by habitat structure (McCoy and Bell, 1991). In addition to the effects on predatory success, habitats having different structur- al regimes may manifest effects on the specific behaviors used to acquire prey. Such behavioral modification may result from changes in habitat selection that in- fluence choice of foraging substrate (Fra- gaszy and Boinski, 1995), foraging mode (pursuit versus ambush tactics) (Moer- mond, 1979; Murray et al., 1995), or prey type and its behavior that affects the as- sociated predatory behaviors (Jones, 1990). Variation in the expression of spe- cific behaviors may be also associated with perceived risk of foraging in a particular habitat (Lima and Dill, 1990, and refer- ences therein). Changes in behavioral ex- pression in response to different micro- habitat conditions may alter levels of pred- atory success unless the different behav- iors are equally effective at finding and capturing prey in the respective microhab- itats. Examinations of predatory success as a function of habitat structural complexity in 18</page><page sequence="2">March 1999] HERPETOLOGICA 19 snakes have considered only semi-aquatic species (Mullin and Mushinsky, 1995, 1997). In aquatic habitats, snakes are sur- rounded by a vegetational structure that is relatively uniform (aquatic macrophytes or littoral plants) compared to the heteroge- neous vegetational landscape possibly en- countered by a terrestrial species of snake. Examination of snake foraging ecology in habitats of differing structural complexity often requires extensive use of radio te- lemetry (Weatherhead and Hoysak, 1989) and lengthy observation periods to docu- ment rare predatory events. In this study, we present an alternative technique of simulating the habitat in a laboratory set- ting where observations of snake foraging can be closely monitored. While unable to replicate all parameters of the natural hab- itat accurately, this research was designed to illustrate how alterations of closely con- trolled variables manifest changes in for- aging behavior or success. The gray rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta spi- loides) preys upon several avian and small mammalian species (Cink, 1991; Fitch, 1963; Hensley and Smith, 1986; Jackson, 1974; Mirarchi and Hitchcock, 1982) in a variety of habitats (Durner and Gates, 1993). We examined the influence of hab- itat structural complexity on the success (measured as latency to capture a single prey item: Royama, 1970) of gray rat snakes foraging for small mammals. Addi- tionally, we quantified differences in snake behaviors at different levels of structural complexity that may indicate shifts in for- aging mode for this generalist predator. MATERIALS AND METHODS Habitat Simulation During June 1994, the vegetation com- position in randomly selected 2.25 m2 quadrats was measured within the wildlife management area of Meeman-Shelby For- est State Park (MSFSP), Shelby County, Tennessee. The number of living plants within each plot was counted, and plant size of the annually emergent understory was measured at each stem base (?0.5 mm) using calipers.

The plant species at MSFSP are reported in Mullin (1998). Three enclosures (each 2.25 m2 and 2 m in height), simulating several habitat pa- rameters of a bottomland hardwood forest (characterized by MSFSP), were con- structed and maintained in the laboratory. We are unaware of any study of similar scope that has used larger enclosures. The walls and ceiling of each enclosure were comprised of a combination of tin flashing and fiberglass-mesh screen to prevent sub- ject escape (Fig. 1). Temperature and pho- toperiod in the enclosures were 26-29 C and 14:10 h light: dark, respectively. Light intensity on the floor of the enclosures was within the range measured under the can- opy at MSFSP during the vegetation sam- pling period. The conditions were held constant for the duration of the study; lo- gistical considerations prevented us from determining how within-season changes in</page><page sequence="3">20 HERPETOLOGICA [Vol. 55, No. 1 the floristic composition may affect snake predatory performance. Based on measurements of vegetation density obtained from MSFSP (x ? 1 SE = 64.0 ? 2.3 plants m-2; n = 144), we chose five treatments of habitat structural complexity for the foraging trials: 200%, 150%, 100%, 50%, and 0% of the mean ambient vegetation density. We used arti- ficial plants matching the mean stem di- ameter of understory plants measured at MSFSP (6.5 ? 0.3 mm) to simulate the vegetation within each enclosure. We ran- domly inserted plants into a foam base lin- ing the enclosure floor that was covered by leaf litter collected at MSFSP. An inert substrate, the foam layer enabled us to change the arrangement of plants between successive trials within the same treatment density, such that individual snakes were not exposed to the same arrangement of plants. Arboreal microhabitat was provided in the enclosures by constructing free-stand- ing trees from large branches of deciduous trees collected at MSFSP [although ex- amined elsewhere (Mullin, 1998), use of trees by snakes and their prey in this study was rare]. To prevent simulated trees from tipping over inside the enclosures, as well as prey escape, branches were not added to trees. Gray rat snakes are excellent climbers (Jackson, 1976) and easily as- cended the constructed trees in the ab- sence of branches or vines. While these treatment conditions may not represent the full range of habitat types encountered by gray rat snakes, they do represent a rea- sonable range of variation about a mean level of structural complexity found in a bottomland hardwood forest. Foraging Trials Adult gray rat snakes were obtained from MSFSP and other forested and semi- rural areas within Shelby County (Tennes- see Wildlife Resources Agency Permit 684), and they were maintained in captiv- ity (Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee protocol A-9336) at tempera- ture and photoperiod levels identical to those for the enclosures. Snakes were housed individually in cages measuring a minimum of 30 X 60 X 30 cm, provided with water ad libitum, and fed either Northern Bobwhite Quail (Colinus virgi- nianus) eggs or mice (Mus domesticus) weekly. Before their use in foraging trials, we measured the snout-vent length (SVL: ?0.5 cm) and determined the sex of each snake using a cloacal probe. Prior to its use in a foraging trial, a sub- ject was placed on a restricted diet (water alone) for 3 wk and was acclimatized to the enclosure for the last three days of that period. Immediately preceding the trial, the individual was removed from the en- closure and its mass was determined (?0.05 g). During that time (a minimum of 15 min was allowed), a mouse was ac- climatized to the enclosure. We used only adult male mice having dark brown pelage as prey in the trials to minimize differ- ences in the predator's perception of be- havioral, visual, and vomeronasal charac- teristics of prey, and to provide prey visu- ally similar to those that snakes encounter in the field. We used mice having similar mass (x = 30.7 ? 0.5 g, n = 70), although the ratio of prey mass to snake mass was not fixed during the study. Behavior of prey in enclosures having different vege- tation densities did not change noticeably, and any unperceived changes in prey be- havior were assumed to have a negligible effect on snake predatory success. Upon re-introducing the individual into the enclosure (in the corner farthest re- moved from the mouse at that time), the snake's foraging behavior was recorded on video tape, and the time required for suc- cessful capture (latency: ?1 s) and inges- tion of prey was monitored by a timer on the video cassette recorder. Specific be- haviors were identified and described (Ta- ble 1) following Mullin and Mushinsky (1995). Based on observations during pre- liminary trials and radio-telemetered indi- viduals in the field, behaviors were cate- gorized as foraging-type if an individual's tongue-flick rate (TFR) exceeded one flick/2 s, or non-foraging type for slower TFR's. Because steps were taken to mini- mize other disturbances during the time that the subject was being weighed, we are confident that tongue-flicking activity was</page><page sequence="4">March 1999] HERPETOLOGICA 21 TABLE 1-.Description of behaviors performed by gray rat snakes during foraging trials in simulated habitats of varying vegetation density between 19 August 1994 and 10 December 1996.

From the video taped recordings, we determined the time that individuals spent performing each behav- ior from the initiation of each trial until successful capture of prey. Between 19 August 1994 and 10 De- cember 1996, foraging trials for each treat- ment density of vegetation were replicated with 14 gray rat snakes. The order in which individuals of each sex were ex- posed to different treatment densities was chosen haphazardly. We presumed that snakes not responding to the presence of prey 2 h after initiation of a trial were un- responsive, and we re-tested them at a lat- er date (in a new arrangement of vegeta- tion). Mice did not have the opportunity to escape in this study, meaning that we could not examine the effect of prey war- iness on potential predation.

Compar- isons of response mean values across treat- ment levels of the independent variables were conducted using multivariate repeat- ed-measures analyses of variance (MAN- OVAR) or analyses of covariance (MAN- COVAR), the latter controlling for differ- ences in snake size (Cohen, 1965; McCall and Appelbaum, 1973). The means of monthly SVL measurements taken during the period that each individual was used in the experiment were used as covariate values (i.e., SVL was fixed over time as the covariate: Huitema, 1980). When statisti- cally significant differences were attribut- able to vegetation density (having five lev- els), or for any interaction between inde- pendent variables, we used Tukey's hon- estly significant difference test (HSD: df = 1 in all comparisons) as the follow-up test to detect differences between treatment means (Kirk, 1982). Statistical tests were conducted using Statistical Programs for the Social Sciences (Norusis, 1990) software at aL = 0.05. Be- havioral times were expressed as percent- ages of their respective trial durations, be- cause the durations of specific behaviors are directly proportional to trial length. Relationships among variables that might be dependent on snake size (e.g., the du- ration of behaviors associated with prey handling time: see Table 1) were tested us- ing the ratio of prey mass to predator mass as the independent variable; data are oth- erwise reported in raw form. Because trials were conducted in three different cages, we ensured that there was no relationship between latency to prey capture and trial location (MANOVA: F2,17 = 0.56, P = 0.58). Individuals tested at one treatment density did not gain expe- rience that influenced their performance during subsequent trials in different treat- ments (MANOVAR: F452 = 0.78, P = 0.56). RESULTS Subjects ranged from 101.6-148.4 cm in SVL and from 252.1-771.6 g in mass (x = 123.9 ? 1.8 cm and 475.5 ? 17.4 g, re- spectively). There were no reliable differ- ences in subject SVL or mass as a function of gender (t-test; P - 0.50). The time taken to ingest the prey (IOP: Table 1) was positively correlated with the ratio of prey mass to snake mass (r = 0.66, n = 70, P &lt; 0.001). As a covariate, SVL did not affect the outcome of any analysis (MANCOVAR: F1]11 = 2.37, P = 0.15); it is hereafter ig- nored and MANOVAR results are report- ed. The time required by subjects to cap- ture prey did not differ reliably among treatments of vegetation density (Table 2: F49 = 1.71, P = 0.23). There were no re- liable differences in latency to prey cap- ture as a function of snake gender (F1 11 = 0.76, P = 0.40), nor was there any signif- icant interaction between gender and veg- etation density (F49 = 0.68, P = 0.63). Several of the described behaviors were recorded in ' 10% of the trials. Because the summed durations of these behaviors comprised &lt;5% of the total trial durations, they were excluded from statistical com- parisons of duration as a function of veg- etation density. The three behaviors asso- ciated with handling the prey (Table 3)</page><page sequence="6">March 1999] HERPETOLOGICA 23 TABLE 3.-Handling time (seconds) for Mus domes- ticus prey (n = 70), following successful capture, re- quired by gray rat snakes foraging in simulated hab- itat enclosures bewteen 19 August 1994 and 10 December 1996.

Among those behaviors occurring in &gt;10% of the trials (Table 4), certain be- haviors occurred more often than others regardless of vegetation density (F9,108 = 1.99, P = 0.05). Individuals spent more time slow searching (SLS), stationary searching (STS), or resting on litter (ROL) compared to other behaviors (Tukey's HSD: F ' 33.15, P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, individuals spent more time resting under litter (RUL) than striking (STR) regardless of vegetation density (F = 5.61, P = 0.05); the duration of the latter behavior, when expressed, was always &lt;2 s. Behavioral fre- quency and duration did not vary as a function of snake gender (F,12 = 0.10, P = 0.76), nor were there any interactions between gender and behavior type (F9108 = 0.78, P = 0.64). The duration of certain behaviors varied as a function vegetation density (F36432 = 3.15, P &lt; 0.001). Individuals spent more time performing RUL in the 150% density treatment than at other vegetation densi- ties (Tukey's HSD: F ' 8.96, P &lt; 0.03). More time was spent performing ROL at 100% density than at 0% density (F = 9.07, P = 0.03), but differences in dura- tions of this behavior between other treat- ment levels were absent. Similarly, snakes spent more time performing SLS at 0% density than either the 150% or 200% treatment levels (F ' 5.79, P ' 0.05), but there were no differences in SLS duration between other treatments. Three-way in- teractions between gender, vegetation density, and behavior duration were absent (F36432 = 1.30, P = 0.12). We constructed post hoc orthonormal- ized comparisons (Kirk, 1982) of pooled percent times of ecologically related be- haviors (Table 1). Behaviors occurring while snakes were concealed under the leaf litter [e.g., RUL, searching under lit- ter (SUL)] did not occur as often as those TABLE 4.-Percent times (:i ? 1 SE, n = 14) which gray rat snakes spent performing specific behaviors while foraging in simulated habitats of differing vegetation density between 19 August 1994 and 10 December 1996.

Use of the tail as a modifier of described behaviors [e.g., slow searching with caudal distraction (SLS-CD), stationary searching with cau- dal distraction (STS-CD)] did not occur as often as those behaviors lacking simulta- neous tail movement (F = 131.54, P &lt; 0.001); when observed, use of the tail oc- curred usually immediately prior to prey capture. Behaviors considered as pursuit foraging occurred more often than behav- iors classified as ambush foraging (F = 35.29, P &lt; 0.001). DISCUSSION Predatory Success The time required for gray rat snakes to capture mice did not differ in habitats that simulated different levels of vegetation density. Unlike other studies (Heck and Orth, 1980; Nelson, 1979; Nelson and Bonsdorff, 1990), this species may per- form equally well over a wide range of habitat structural complexities when for- aging for small mammals. The absence of a narrow optimal level of complexity should not imply, however, that gray rat snakes are suboptimal foragers in all levels of habitat structure (Pierce and Ollason, 1987). As dietary generalists, gray rat snakes may be adept at not only ingesting different types of prey (Mullin, 1996), but searching for them in different structural settings as well. Generalist garter snakes (Thamnophis) can be highly successful predators under certain conditions whilst inadequate in others, a conclusion that Drummond (1983) attributed to behavior- al pattern. Gray rat snake predatory suc- cess may be independent of habitat struc- tural complexity, because their foraging behaviors are sufficiently diverse to cap- ture prey successfully in a variety of mi- crohabitats. Gray rat snakes appeared responsive to visual stimuli as they would abruptly direct their head towards moving prey on the op- posite side of the enclosure. Similar reac- tion to visual stimuli from relatively distant prey has been reported in garter snakes (Thamnophis: Drummond, 1985; Heinen, 1995; Schaeffel and Mathis, 1991) as well as for gray rat snakes foraging for avian prey (Mullin et al., 1998). The acute re- sponsiveness to both visual and chemosen- sory stimuli probably facilitates gray rat snakes locating and capturing prey in an array of structural regimes. For example, while visual perception may be important when foraging in sparsely vegetated habi- tats (where mobile prey can be seen and followed with relative ease), vomeronasal cues may play a more important role for snakes seeking small rodents in highly complex environments (in part, because an increased amount of structure provides more substrate for chemical deposition). Further manipulative experiments in hab- itat enclosures similar to those used in this study may identify the conditions in which specific visual or chemosensory cues are most important. There are several alteruative (and as yet untested) explanations why, when foraging for small rodents, gray rat snake predatory success is unaffected by changes in habitat structural complexity. (1) As with other dietary generalists, gray rat snakes may switch foraging modes (ambush versus pursuit) even when for- aging in similar habitats (Helfman, 1990; Jones and Whitford, 1989). Impartial use of both foraging modes in all habitat types would obscure differences in latency to prey capture as a function of habitat com- plexity, because lower latency values gen- erally associated with pursuit foraging would presumably be offset by higher val- ues associated with an ambush strategy. (2) Vegetation, regardless of its density, does not hide vomeronasal cues available to snakes searching for prey (Chiszar et al., 1990). Thus, gray rat snakes following re- cent scent trails from rodents moving across the forest floor may experience equal levels of predatory success at all densities of vegetation. (3) The escape and, or, avoidance be- haviors of mice may be sufficiently variable to minimize the differences in time re- quired to capture prey in different levels of structural complexity. Use of a dual vid- eo recording system may illustrate prey behavioral variation in response changes in</page><page sequence="8">March 1999] HERPETOLOGICA 25 habitat complexity (possibly dependent on predator behavior as well). Alternatives to these hypotheses are fea- tures of the experimental design that could not be improved. Being square in shape, edge effects (Krebs, 1989) within the en- closure may have reduced the prey's ability to avoid the predator. Secondly, chemical identification of snakes by rodents has been documented in several species (Dell'omo and Alleva, 1994; Hennessey and Owings, 1978; Randall et al., 1995). Because mice were allowed to acclimatize within the enclosures only after snakes had been provided with a similar opportunity, the prey might have detected recent pred- ator presence. Either of these factors may have masked differences in latency to cap- ture in the different structural regimes. It is worth restating that we examined changes in predatory response resulting from quantified manipulation of a known environmental variable. We do not suggest that the habitat enclosures used in our study simulated the full range of features encountered by gray rat snakes. Rather, they did attempt to match characteristics that we believe are important to the suc- cess of foraging snakes and, in the case of habitat structural complexity, represent a reasonable range of variation about a mean level measured in a bottomland hardwood forest. Foraging Behaviors Gray rat snakes spent more time resting under the litter in the 150% density treat- ment than in other treatment levels of veg- etation density, suggesting preferential use of ambush postures when foraging in hab- itats of limited lateral visibility. The litter effectively concealed the snakes from their prey, and strikes from such a position were generally more frequent in habitats of high complexity. Use of similar ambush pos- tures in structured environments has been noted for other species of snakes (Jones, 1990; Jones and Whitford, 1989). While vomeronasal cues are clearly important for detecting prey presence by this and other species of snakes (Halpern, 1992), visual confirmation of prey is sometimes prereq- uisite to attempting capture (Ford and Burghardt, 1993). Gray rat snakes waiting to confirm the presence of prey chemicals visually may spend more time foraging in ambush, but they may also elevate their probability of successful capture. Tail movement in what has herein been described as caudal distraction appears to facilitate prey capture by drawing the at- tention of the prey away from the snake's head (Mullin, 1998). Gray rat snakes spent more time slow searching and stationary searching than those same behaviors mod- ified with caudal distraction. The short du- rations of behaviors that included tail movement were not unexpected, however, because when used to facilitate prey cap- ture, tail displays occurred in the seconds immediately preceding a strike at the prey. The absence of this behavior in gray rat snakes foraging for avian prey (Mullin, 1998) suggests that predatory behaviors may be mediated by the prey type sought (possibly through a cognitive mechanism: Burghardt, 1991). General behavioral trends documented in this study (i.e., comparisons of pooled groups of functionally similar behaviors) do not differ markedly from species troph- ically similar to Elaphe. More time was spent above the leaf litter layer than con- cealed by it. Gray rat snakes are generally not fossorial, and they seek extended (&gt;24 h) refuge under cover objects only during oviposition or periods of over-wintering (Fitch, 1963; Reinert, 1993; Weatherhead, 1989). Subjects also spent more time slow searching, stationary searching, and resting on litter. The two search behaviors were classified as a pursuit foraging mode, while the resting posture occurred when snakes either were uninterested in foraging or used an ambush foraging strategy. These results indicate that gray rat snakes can switch between foraging modes (Helfman, 1990), an ability that would promote ef- fective foraging in a variety of structural complexities in the habitat (discussed above). CONCLUSIONS A quantified environmental variable was precisely manipulated to assess its effects on predatory success-a technique em-</page><page sequence="9">26 HERPETOLOGICA [Vol. 55, No. 1 ployed in few other studies concerning snake foraging ecology (Mullin et al., 1998; Mullin and Mushinsky, 1995, 1997). La- tency to prey capture in gray rat snakes foraging for small mammals was not influ- enced by variation in habitat structural complexity, and several foraging behaviors were exhibited in all tested levels of com- plexity. Although alternative hypotheses are also plausible, phenotypic plasticity in foraging mode may allow this dietary gen- eralist species to seek and capture small mammals effectively in a wide range of habitat types. Because environmental de- terminants of the compromise could result in a continuous change in the optimal for- aging strategy, generalist predators should be flexible in their strategies such that net energetic intake is maximized (Helfman, 1990; Stephens and Krebs, 1986). Such flexibility may be achieved simply through effective use of a few foraging behaviors in a variety of habitat types. The measure of habitat structural com- plexity simulated in the laboratory enclo- sures was based solely upon vegetation measurements taken at MSFSP. Conclu- sions concerning predatory performance and behavioral patterns in gray rat snakes, therefore, should not be generalized out- side of the field locality. Increasing the available comparative data on snake for- aging ecology through further manipula- tive studies in large simulated habitats could increase the role of zoological parks as institutions of ecologically oriented re- search (Chiszar et al., 1993) and establish stronger relationships between foraging behavior, predatory success, and charac- teristics of the predator's habitat.
