THE MONIST ORMAZD, OR THE ANCIENT PERSIAN IDEA HESE are the words in whic^ Zoroaster, the Prophet of an cient Iran, was wont to pray to the Holy One of Persia, to the Lord God of Iran, as we read in the Avesta or ancient Sacred Books of the Parsis. It was this figure of Ahura Mazda, or Or mazd, that Zoroaster proclaimed to stand at the head of the host of heaven as supreme ruler over the great kingdom of good, of truth, of light, and as regent and sovereign above all peers. ' 'A great god is Aura-mazda, the greatest of the gods " says King Darius also in the grand royal inscriptions on the rock at Behistan when he invokes blessings upon his people and gives thanks to Ormazd for all his mercies and kindnesses, in tones that resem ble the fervor and dignity of the Psalmist chanting "the Lord is a great God, and a great king above all gods." Everywhere in the Zoroastrian scriptures the supremacy of Ahura Mazda is recognised and acknowledged ; everywhere in his names, titles, attributes and functions, there is evidence of the exalted idea which the Persians held of the majesty of this supermundane figure, of the purity of this transcendental divine being whom the Zoroastrian religion set up to be worshipped as god. So characteristic is this supreme OF GOD.

The Greeks, with their anthropomorphic notion of the pantheon of heaven, seem to have been struck by the spiritual ity and the immaterial nature of the Iranian conception of the god head. Herodotus tells us that the Persians charge with folly those who erect statues or temples of the gods, "because they do not think the gods have human forms, as the Greeks do "; while ac V Fig. i.

Avesta as the Church Fathers stand to the Bible, we learn that it is in the majesty of the sacred flame that A harmazd reveals him self to the transported seers of Iran, just as Jehovah manifested himself in a great light to the prophets of old.1 It must not be sup posed, however, that the figure of the great Iranian god is abso lutely free from all anthropomorphic traits. Such suggestions of anthropomorphism as are noticeable, and they are slight, will be discussed hereafter. But first we must look at the general attri butes and functions of the Persian divinity. Ahur a Mazda. The name Ahura Mazda which always stands first in the formulaic address by the Prophet when he begins to commune with his god, is in itself an ideal title. It means the " Lord-Wisdom" {Ahura-Mazda). This "Sovereign Knowledge" universally appears as the chief characteristic of the Iranian deity. In a chapter of the Avestan ritual devoted to Ormazd and antici pating the thousand names of Allah, Ahura Mazda himself says : "my sixth name is Intelligence, my seventh name is the Intelli gent. My eighth name is Knowledge, my ninth name is Endowed with Knowledge. I am the Sage by name ; and I am by name the Sagest."2 Everywhere in the Avesta, moreover, Ahura Mazda is represented as creating with "Intelligence"; whereas his antag onist Anra Mainyu creates with Ignorance. Ormazd is prescient, rich in wisdom, and omniscient ; his opponent Ahriman is ignorant, lacking in knowledge, and endowed only with after-thought. The contrast between Ormazd and Ahriman, however, must remain to be discussed more fully upon some other occasion. Thou Spirit Most Holy. These words of the address, "Spirit Most Holy," or " Spirit Most Beneficent," exhibit one of the most 1 Arta-Vir f, IOI. 10-12; Zartusht Namah, p. 492, 1. 35 (in Wilson's Parsi Religion). 2Avestan Yasht I. 7, 15.

I 5 characteristic attributes of Ahura Mazda as Spenta Mainyu or Mai nyu Sp nishta, the good spirit, opposed to the evil spirit Anra Mainyu?- And now we must philosophise for a moment, as we have before us a tenet which is as metaphysical as the Trinitarian doctrine in Christian theology. The attribute Spenta Mainyu, as part of Ahura Mazda's per sonality, is in some instances, especially in the G th s or Zoroas trian Psalms, conceived of as an emanation from Ahura himself.2 In such cases it comes to be regarded almost as a personal being that plays the role of intermediary, especially in creative activity, somewhat like Vohu Manah, or the archangel of Good Thought. This relation between Ahura Mazda and Spenta Mainyu in the Psalms of Zoroaster much resembles that of the Holy Ghost to the Father in the New Testament, because Spenta Mainyu, or the "Holy Spirit," is of the same substance with Ahura Mazda3; and, as we might naturally suppose, so subtle a distinction naturally gave rise to different views of interpretation in Zoroastrianism itself and to the varying dogmas of sects. It was this sharp antithesis of Spenta Mainyu to Anra Mainyu which is present in the Zoroastrian G th s as the Parsis empha sise, that led still farther in later times to the separation of attri bute and essence from the person. The sacred Pahlavi literature of the Sassanian period recognises the personification of the essence and spirit (the Pahlavi Sp'n k M dinog) conceived of as separate and apart from the Divine Being.4 In fact there is just as much 1 Some of the most specific passages in the Avesta are : Ys. 30. 5 ; Ys. 44. 7; Ys. 45. 2 ; Ys. 43 5 : Ys. 57- 17 : Yt. 13. 13 ; Yt. 15. 3, 43, 44 ; Yt. 19. 44. 46 ; Vd.

The modern Parsis have gone so far as to re gard Ahura Mazda as comprising within himself both Spenta Mai nyu and Anra Mainyu, as two spirits of opposite character, if not opposing nature, two principles, the good and the evil, two poles of the magnet, positive and negative.1 This view is evidently recog nised, together with other views, by Shahrast ni (A. D. 1086-1153), in his account of the sects and philosophical schools, when he states that the sect of the Gayomarthians maintain 4hat the evil spirit Ahri man sprang from the good principle.2 Haug most clearly presented the Parsi attitude when he sought to draw a distinction between Zoroaster's theology as monotheism and his speculative philosophy as dualism.3 As a whole, however, the modern Parsi view, although it must command the most serious attention and investigation, seems to the present writer rather to be a later development, along more sharply defined lines, of what is only latent in the early times of the G th s. In other words, it appears to be a conception which has its origin perhaps in the growth of monotheistic tendencies and it appears to be due rather to the influences of certain older sects, than it seems to represent the original teaching of Zoroaster him self. Still, such a statement, although it represents a common view of the question, must be taken with reserve, for the Parsis strenuously maintain that foreigners misunderstand the standpoint of the G th s in this matter. Nevertheless, the direct opposition between Ormazd pofidah^) and Ahriman ('A/oei^ano ) as the good and the evil genius (oat/Awv), or as two antagonistic principles 1 See the views of the Parsi authorities Firoz Jamaspji in Casartelli, Mazda yasnian Religion, p. 19 note; J.

( pxai), is as old as Aristotle, if we may accept the authority of Diogenes Laertius.1 The attribute Spenta Mainyu has been translated above by "Holy Spirit." The English word holy (A. S. hal) with all its comprehensive idea of absolute excellence, fulness, completion, finish, perfection, is not far remote in its original sense (cf. whole) from the Avestan spenta. The latter has as many cognates and de rivatives in the Avesta as the English holy has in the Bible (cf. also Germ, heil and its kin), and like "holy" the word "spenta" is a Fig. 3. SCULPTURES OM THE TOMB OP DARIUS. (Flandin et Coste, Perse Ancienne, at Persepolis, pl. 164. Leoormant, V., p. 23.) great cardinal term in Zoroastrian theology. The true and funda mental idea of the Iranian word and its cognates is that of "growth increase, furtherance, progress, power, beneficence, perfection/ which are synonyms with the Zoroastrian conception of holiness.9 As for mainyu, "spirit," it has been sufficiently shown above how ideal in its spirituality the Iranian conception of the godhead 1 Diogenes Laertius, de Vit. Ph os., Proom. 8. 2 The best discussion of the term is to be found in Darmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 39, 89-92. For the development of meaning we may compare the etymological force of "august" (Lat., augeo).</page><page sequence="8">THE MONIST. really is. Attention has already been called to what the Greeks re marked on this subject. Herodotus emphasises that the Persians have no images of the gods because they do not believe, as the Greeks do, that the gods have "human forms." And when the Avesta speaks of Ahura Mazda as having a "body" (kehrf), we must remember that it is rather in the shape of the holy flame that he manifests his presence to mankind, or in the form of light, be cause "he wears the heaven as a robe."1 Fig. 4. SASSANIAN BAS-RBLIEF. ORMA2D PRESENTS THE CROWN TO ARDASHIR. (From Curzon, Persia, II. p. 123.) Nor is the sculptured rock at Behistan or the later Sassanian bas-reliefs a violation of the conception. King Darius in the great inscription evidently caused a representation of Aura-mazda to be carved above his own portrait. This figure floats in a winged cir cle over the head of the king and presents to him a ring or symbol of sovereignty. See Fig. 3. It has been supposed that this conventional figure represents *Cf. Avesta, Ys. I. i ; Ys. 30. 5 ; Yt. 13. 3 ; and especially Ys. 36. 6.</page><page sequence="9">ORMAZD. 169 rather the fravashi or idealised spirit of the king ; but there can hardly remain any doubt that it represents Ormazd when we com pare it with a passage in the Avesta (Vend. 2) and with similar representations of the godhead in Sassanian bas-reliefs, where a like figure is pictured at Naksh-i-R stam as presenting to the rul ing monarch the emblem of sovereignty, and the name Ormazd is actually inscribed on the stone.1 See Figs. 4, 8. This conventional representation of Ormazd is not Iranian in origin nor by nature ; it is borrowed from Assyrian or Babylonian art, as is generally acknowledged by scholars, and as is illustrated by the reproductions from an Assyrian cylinder and cameo, with a winged symbol of the divinity, on the next page. So special a representation of the deity on the Achsemenian trilingual inscrip tions may have been designed by Darius for particular reasons. It is manifest throughout that he wishes to emphasise his divine right to the throne, and this plastic delineation of the divinity himself offering the sovereignty to the king, might well be calculated to appeal to the non-Persian conquered nations who were perhaps more anthropomorphic in their ideas. The later Sassanian bas relief representation would simply be borrowed from the older Achaemenian sculptures or with the same intent. (See Fig. 8.) We may understand the situation better if we recall that mediaeval Christian art did not shrink from representing the Deity as a bearded patriarch in flowing robes. With regard, furthermore, to the theme under discussion, of Ahura Mazda as a spirit (tnainyu), we may add that the purity and ideality of the conception is in no degree interfered with by the allusions to him in the Zoroastrian Psalms as "the father of Vohu Manah (archangel of Good Thought)," or again as "the father of Asha (Righteousness).2 He is always represented as the creator of 1 See Edward Thomas, " Sassanian Inscriptions " in Journal of the Royal Asi atic Society, New Series, Vol. III., p. 269 and p. 267 note 3, London, 1868.

In the Yashts, or Avestan hymns of praise, he has Armaiti(Holy Harmony, goddess of the Earth) as daughter. The angel Ashi Vanuhi (Good Piety, and its resulting blessings) is their child ; and this divine creature is a sister of the divinities Sraosha, Rashnu, and Mithra (Obedience, Justice, Truth), who rule as judges of the fate of the soul after death. The Fire ( tar) is the son of Ahura Mazda ; the Fig. j. ASSYRIAN CYLINDER. (British Museum.

There is a noble " Psalm " (G th ) in which Zoroaster inquires into the nature and origin of creation, the maker of the sun, moon, and stars ; of the earth and the sky ; of the trees, winds, and mists ; of the light and of dark ness, morning and evening, wakefulness and slumber; and of the governing power that rules and directs the world ; and, finally, in the confidence of his belief he rises to a grand climax as he bursts out into an exclamation calling upon "Thee, O, Mazda, the Creator of all through thy Holy Spirit."1 In the Avestan prose "Seven Chapters," which can be but little later than the metrical G th s, Ahura Mazda is the creator of "all good things," including espe cially the animals, plants, the light and the earth.2 In the opening Fig. 7. ASSYRIAN CYLINDER. (Layard, Cuite de Mitra, pl. xxx., No. 7.

Ormazd's creation is 1 Ys. 44. 3-7. This passage is especially cited in connexion with the idea of Spenta Mainyu. 2 Ys. 37. i 8 Translation of Ys.

I form the light, and create darkness ; I make peace, and create evil ; I the Lord do all these things."0 This much, how ever, may be stated off-hand, that in almost every passage in Iran ian literature there is no question as to Ormazd's being the author and source of all that is good; his creation is marred only by his adversary Ahriman as in the two familiar passages of the Vend d d and the B ndahishn.6 1 Cf. also Darmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 26-27. 2 Ancient Persian Inscriptions Dar, Elv. 1 (=0. 1). 3 Phi.

The true force of this final attribute "righteous " (ashavari), which sums up the formulaic address, can best be appreciated when we understand the significance of the original word asha "right, order, law, purity, righteousness," from which it is derived.1 This is the same word as the Sanskrit rta, and it primitively denoted the order which pervades the world, the law in harmony with which men should live.2 In the Avesta this concept becomes personified by Zoroaster as Asha "Law, Order, Righteousness," one of the seven Archangels or Immortal Holy Ones. Ahura Mazda, in the Zoroastrian Psalms, is "the father of Asha" and "the very founder of Righteousness";3 or, in the words of the Christian writer Eusebius, who quotes from Zoroaster, Or mazd is the "father of law and of righteousness"-7rarrjp ewo/xia Kal SiKCLioo-vvrjs.* Throughout all the Pahlavi texts Ai harmazd main tains this position of righteous lord, the great upholder of that uni versal law and order which the world observes, the law which regu lates all that is right. Other Attributes and Functions of Ahura Mazda. From the Avesta, from the Ancient Persian Inscriptions, and from the Sas sanian or Middle Persian writings, we may hastily present some of the epithets which have been gathered, and we may notice the other functions which Ormazd performs. He is not only a righteous creator but he is also the "keeper," "guardian," and "protector" of all his creatures to whom he is ever ready to lend his aid.5 He is "watchful" and "infallible," and he is "not to be deceived" for he is "omniscient";6 he is a giver of rewards and punishments, 1 The attribute ashavan is by no means confined to Ahura Mazda. Like the word "righteous" in the Bible, it is used of man as well as of God ; and when it is applied to sacred things it means "holy, hallowed." 2 See also Darmesteter, Ortnazd et Ahriman, p. 7 seq., and Max M ller, Hibbert Lectures, 1878, pp. 249-253. 3 Ys. 44 3; Ys. 31. 7, 8. 4Eusebius, Praep.

At all events they do not mar the picture, but serve rather to show the harmony that reigns in the heavenly hierarchy, and they detract in no wise from the true exaltation of Ormazd as "the great god, the greatest of the gods," as he is called in the Achaemenian inscriptions. Such a Being is well "worthy of worship" as Zoroaster him self exclaims in the G th -Psalms3; and, to quote from the Church Father, Eusebius, who, on the authority of Osthanes, claims that they are Zoroaster's own words, we may well cite a description which portrays the Magian idea of god as a being who is "the first, the imperishable, the invisible ; unbegotten and elemental4 ; the incomparable one, the ruler of everything beautiful ; the incor ruptible ; best among the good, sage among the sagest ; the father of law and of righteousness ; self taught ; of his own nature and substance (i. e., &lt; &gt;V&lt;TIK &lt;;); perfect and wise ; the sole devisor of the holy order of nature."5 Certain Mythological Traits, or Traces of Old Survivals.

The Psalmist's grand image of the divinity that rides upon the wings of the wind, with clouds and darkness beneath his feet, and with darkness and light nings around his throne, or, again, who makes the heaven his seat and the earth his footstool, is a picture not free from naturalistic touches. Zoroastrianism cannot be expected to be more exempt than Judaism from preserving some traces of an original identity of the god idea with the sky.1 Search in the Iranian scriptures will reveal the presence of certain physical traits in the notion of god head which survive from an older stage of the religion and repre sent a more material and concrete conception than the spiritual and abstract idea described. We ourselves know how to judge of these. The prayer to the father "in heaven " is as old as religion it self. God dwells in the sky and sometimes he is one with the sky. When Herodotus says the Persians "call the whole circle of the heaven Zeus," or when Darius invokes Zeus (i. e., Ormazd) as he launches the arrow skyward and vows vengeance against the Athen ians, we see in these instances merely an evidence of what belongs alike to every religion, to every race and clime. Allusion has already been made above to such lingering touches of an original stage of nature worship or to mythological traces which may still be recog nised in the figure of Ormazd. Darmesteter has especially called attention also to certain points of likeness between Ahura Mazda and the divinity of the sky, if not of the waters, Varuna, in India.2 These may be regarded as traits that have been preserved from a common Indo-Iranian or proto-Aryan period. But after all, the resemblances are subordinate in comparison to the individuality and originality of the Persian conception of the godhead ; and they fade into the background when the figure of Ahura Mazda is viewed in its full light. How different, moreover, the fate of the Indian divinity was in contrast to the Iranian deity, may be judged from history.

Persia's divine being advances more and more into the light, rising higher and higher as time goes on, and is transfigured under the idealistic touch of Zoroaster until it stands forth with an effulgence so brilliant as to render Mazda ism, or the religion of Mazda, almost monotheistic in its character because of this exaltation of the single Supreme Being. Summary and Conclusion. Zoroastrianism, and the religion of Ancient Persia, presents us with a strikingly ideal conception of the godhead. In its purity and spirituality the figure possesses an individuality, elevation and loftiness that is not to be paralleled in the ancient religion of Greece, of Rome, of India. The gods of the Greek and Roman pantheon, with their human forms, their hu man passions, their human failings, can offer no likeness to the Lord God of Iran with his heavenly host of angels and archangels. Nor can the frenzied Indra, exhilarated by copious draughts of intox icating soma and accompanied by the warring elements of the storm, afford a parallel. No, nor the pale and colorless Brahma, nor that vague Nirvana or state into which the faithful follower of Buddha sinks back or is re-absorbed. No, none of these present a true match for such a conception of the Supreme Being as Zoro aster taught. The majesty of the kingly figure of Ahura Mazda in the Avesta, in the Achaemenian inscriptions, in the Pahlavi litera ture of Sassanian times-this truly characteristic production of Zoroaster's spirit-finds its parallel and superior in Sacred Scrip ture alone. The concept of Ormazd, however, in its purity, its ideality, its dignity, can offer a fair comparison to the flaming majesty of the Holy One of Israel, the God of truth, of justice, of power and of wrath, or to the Being who, in our Saviour's teach ing, is more especially the God also of love, of goodness and mercy -the Father in Heaven in whom we believe and place our trust. In one point, however, the god of ancient Persia strikingly differs from the God of Israel. This is in the attribute of Omnip otence. Ahura Mazda, although omnipresent and omniscient, is nevertheless not omnipotent ; his power is ever limited, hampered, confined, by that self-existent, coeval, but not co-eternal, rival</page><page sequence="18">i78 THE MONIST. Anra Mainyu. "May Ahur a Mazda rule at will over his creatures " -rule at will, as shall be when the millennium comes-this is the constant prayer of the pious Zoroastrian. But a fuller discussion of this point and of the resemblances between Ormazd and Jeho vah, must remain for another occasion. A. V. WILLIAMS JACKSON. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, N. Y.</page></plain_text>
