<plain_text><page sequence="1">HINDU TITANISM It is truly ironic that the most famous gods of the world's religions- Gautama, Krsna, and Jesus-began their religious careers as human be- ings. In his sermons, Gautama Buddha made it clear that he had come only to teach the Dharma and that his disciples were not to worship him as god or savior. Although a few commentators choose to read divine attributes into the earliest reference, the Chandogya Upanisad describes Krsna as a man, the son of Vasudeva and Devaki (3.17.6). The Jesus of the Synoptic Gospels speaks of himself as a good Jew would, making a clear distinction between himself and God. Once he rebuked those who called him "good," for "no one is good but God alone" (Mk 10:18). An early and widespread Christology was "adoptionism," the view that Jesus was just a human being, approved and adopted by God at his baptism. It is doubly ironic that Krsna and Gautama actually became higher than the Vedic gods: the Buddha is called "God beyond the gods" (de- vatideva) and Krsna becomes the highest expression of divinity, surpass- ing even Brahman itself. Already in some Upanisads the divine person (purusa) exceeds everything, including Brahman; and Krsna is the cul- mination of this Vedic personalism. In some Christian sects, God the Father seems almost totally displaced by the worship of Jesus. Luther called this Jesuologie, and he considered it a form of atheism. At the World Congress of Religions in 1893, Swami Vivekananda defended the atheism of Buddhism and Jainism by arguing that it is perfectly legitimate "to evolve God out of man"; and then he presented the "Buddhology" equivalent of Luther's Jesuologie: "They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the Son."' Heinrich Zimmer has called the preemption of divine prerogatives and confusion of human and divine attributes the "heresy of Titanism,"2 and it could be that the deification of Gautama, Krsna, Jesus, and other religious figures may constitute a form of spiritual Titanism. Zimmer ob- serves that Titans are not only superhuman but also, as we have seen above, superdivine; as such, they are involved in a supergodly task. Even the gods accrue karma, so the human savior will also become the re- deemer of the gods. To my knowledge, no one has ever worked out the details of Zimmer's thesis with regard to Hindu forms of Titanism. Standing in the shadow of a giant in his own right, I presume to take up that task in this essay. Titanism is a radical humanism that does not recognize that there are limits to what humans can become and what they should do. Titanism is humanism gone berserk; it is anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism taken to an extreme. Titans deliberately reverse the positions of humanity Professor of Philosophy at the University of Idaho Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 45, Number 1 January 1995 73-96 ? 1995 by University of Hawaii Press 73 Nicholas F. Gier</page><page sequence="2">Philosophy East &amp; West and divinity; they take over divine prerogatives, and as a result of their hubris, they lose sight of their proper place in the universe. Even if there is no God, these radical humanists delude themselves if they believe they can themselves become gods. The Eastern Titanism that I will discuss has expressed itself ex- clusively in an internal, spiritual way; therefore, one can say that it is a rather benign form of radical humanism. By contrast, the expressions of Western Titanism are primarily external, and with the aid of technology, a Titanistic spirit can be said to inspire militarism, environmental pollu- tion and degradation, and the possible misuse of genetic engineering. If left unchecked, it might destroy or radically change life as we know it on earth. Even though it is Western Titanism that poses the real threat, I be- lieve that it is significant to show that Eastern Titans share some of the same views as their Western counterparts, namely, anthropocentrism and autonomous selfhood. The term "Titan" comes, of course, from the name for a race of older gods, who, under the leadership of Prometheus, stormed Mt. Olympus and battled Zeus and the other Olympian deities for the control of the universe. In Western intellectual and literary history, much has been written about both the positive and negative elements of the Promethean spirit. Even though I have chosen to give the term "Titanism" a negative connotation (as opposed to the Romantics' celebration of Prometheus), I do not wish to give the impression that more knowledge or even new technology are not necessary; and I certainly do not mean to imply that we do not need heroes or saints. Rather, what I am suggesting is that we do require a new vision of human nature, one that breaks out of the tra- ditional Western view of the self. Some Indian views of self-particularly the Samkhya-yoga system-express a view of human autonomy just as radical as Western existentialism. Therefore, yogic and Western Titanism share a basic conceptual bond that has rarely been mentioned. Humanism arose during the so-called "axial period," and it is com- monly observed that while Western people generally responded to the discovery of human individuality by externalizing their new desires in a positive way, the Indians turned inward in an attempt to reconcile anxi- eties caused by an increased awareness of the self-world split. But even in their world-denying practices, many Indian thinkers have remained very much attached to the human form. They have made it the prototype for the shape and origin of the universe (the Jains are most explicit on this point); and they have made it the locus of all spiritual liberation. (To be saved, the gods must eventually have a human incarnation.) Even if this anthropocentric and anthropomorphic cosmos is not taken literally, the image itself is sufficient to indicate a distorted view of human beings and their relation to the world. Not only are the gods supplanted, but nature in general is denigrated in status and value. This becomes an especially 74</page><page sequence="3">serious problem when human beings develop technological means to systematically control and alter nature. Section I is a study of comparative mythology with a focus on "Asura" Titanism and Indian parallels to the story of Prometheus. In section II, I demonstrate why Asura Titanism is the weakest form of Hindu Titanism, and I then present a summary of the four other views: Brahmin, Gnostic, Yoga, and Bhakti Titanism. In section III, I analyze the Purusa hymn of the Rg-veda, which serves as the prototype for divinized humanity in the Indian tradition from the Vedas to the Puranas. In section IV, I analyze the Yoga Titanism of the Samkhya-yoga philosophy as well as the general ascetic/sage Titanism of the Puranic literature. Finally, in section V, I discuss some possible reactions and qualifications to my thesis-particularly the issue of absolute monism-and then I offer Confucianism as an Eastern answer to Titanism. The first form of Hindu Titanism is Asura Titanism. The Sanskrit asura is usually translated as "demon," but sometimes as "Titan" or "antigod." These beings are the principal antagonists of the devas of Hindu religion, especially as it is embodied in the Puranas. A minor problem arises for our comparative analysis, because the Greeks did not have a category for devils or evil ones. Our word "demon" comes from the Greek word daimon, but for the Greeks daimon usually meant good "spirit"-the most illustrious example being Socrates' daimon. Rather than stipulating some thing's nature as either good or evil, the Greeks, like the Chinese, saw the problem as a matter of balance-Heraclitus' logos or Anaxi- mander's dike reconciling opposing forces-with none of the opposites as evil in themselves. The evil of hubris, then, is an attempt to upset that balance. In the case of Prometheus, it was a matter of coveting divine prerogatives (although ironically he was originally a god). Therefore, Prometheus was a thief and a usurper. Western humanists, however, have generally viewed the Prome- thean revolt not only as a necessary transgression but as a good one. Byron claimed that Prometheus' only "crime" was that he liberated hu- manity; and in Prometheus Unbound, Shelley praised the Titan as "good, great and joyous, beautiful and free." There are too many paral- lels, however, between Satan and Prometheus for orthodox Christians to be completely comfortable with Prometheus as a model for human ac- tion. As not always consistent supporters of what I call the "Hebraic" principle3-the absolute qualitative difference between God and hu- mans-Western Christians are usually the first ones to remind us that humans are not supposed to "play" God. Critics might say that as there is no Hebraic principle in Indian thought, there can be no heresy of Titanism. A. L. Basham once said that Nicholas F. Gier 75</page><page sequence="4">"divinity was cheap in ancient India,"4 but it may not always have been that way. Strictly speaking, the "Hebraic" principle ought to be called, in terms of chronological precedence, the "Zoroastrian" or even "Indo- Iranian" principle. As scholars push back the dates of Zoroaster to 1000 B.C.E., three hundred years before the Hebrew prophets, his moral the- ism, with its transcendent Creator Ahura Mazda, appears at a time when the ancient Hebrews were moving from polytheism to henotheism. If Mary Boyce is correct about an original Indo-iranian moral tritheism of Varuna, Mithra, and Ahura, then Zoroaster's predecessors and the origi- nal Indo-Aryans may well have shared the same views of transcendent deity.5 (Vedic polytheism and amoral deities such as Indra can be seen as a degenerate form of an original Aryan moral theology.) Therefore, the devaluation of deity and the origins of Indian Titanism probably have pre-Aryan roots in traditions we now know as Samkhya and Yoga. If de- ity is so cheap in ancient India, then one cannot understand, from the Vedas to the Puranas, the fierce resistance the gods display in defending their prerogatives nor the outrage that occurs when humans-like Vena and Divodasa-make claim to divine attributes. The sage Vyasa knows the rule: "By rituals one reaches the world of the gods; and the gods do not wish that mortals should live on high."6 Returning to the tension between asuras and devas, A. K. Coomar- aswamy once observed that "the Titan [asura] is potentially an Angel [deva], the Angel still by nature a Titan."7 In one Vedic account, both Agni and Soma are former demons, who are won over by Indra, king of the gods. The best example, however, is the great god Siva, who is known as "the Slayer of Titans" on the one hand but the "Lord of the demons" (bhutas) on the other. His son Ganesa is the head of a host of demon/gods called ganas and, according to one story, is the origin of evil in the world.8 In both Greek and Vedic mythology, the Angels and Titans trade places: Krsna dispatches demons to heaven without even giving them a choice, and Prometheus finally (re)gains immortality and joins his former enemies on Mt. Olympus. In the beginning the devas and the asuras shared the same loka and feasted on the same divine food (soma). (This may be due to the "generations of the gods" phenomenon: the asuras being-like the Greek Titans-the older, darker ancestors of the younger, shiny devas- like the Olympians.)9 The demons were not yet evil in any respect, be- cause Varuna is described as the "wise sovereign (asura) king."10 This reminds us that the ancient Iranians, who once shared the same religious practices, called their god the "Wise Lord" (ahura mazda), but called their demons devas. The word yaksa, used to describe a large category of demons, literally means "honored ones." Their origins are most likely pre-Aryan, making them older, in terms of Indian worship, than the Philosophy East &amp; West Vedic gods and demons. The pre-Aryan Jain tradition, for example, re- 76</page><page sequence="5">garded the yaksas-along with raksasas, bhutas, and pisacas-as deities, and contemporary Jains continue to do so to this day. The soma communion was broken after one of the most amazing episodes in Indian mythology. One particular cycle of creation failed to provide enough soma, so the gods persuaded the demons, with the promise of an equal portion, to help them churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of life. After the churning was complete, Visnu, dis- guising himself as a beautiful woman, managed to distract the demons and cheat them out of their share. (Interestingly, in Greek myth it is the Titans, not the gods, who are known for their cunning and deceit.) A great battle broke out between the two parties, and the gods, empowered by their access to the fresh soma, easily defeated the demons. Endless other battles ensued, usually in the form of the demons attempting to steal the sacrifices or each seducing the others' wives. The demons' most powerful weapon against the gods, however, was their perfection of as- cetic practices. This fact becomes important for our argument for Yoga Titanism in section IV. Etymologically, the Sanskrit equivalent of Prometheus is pramatha, whose verb stem is manth, which means "to churn" or "to rob." Wendy O'Flaherty expands on this derivation by observing that manth indicates vigorous backwards and forwards motion of any sort: in the Vedas, it refers primarily to the twirling of the two fire-sticks to produce the sacred flame, an act often given sexual connotations.... Manth also applies to the churning of milk into butter [= soma] and, in addition, often describes violent attack.'1 The sages "churning" the wicked king Vena or Indra "churning" the head of the demon Namuci are examples of the latter use. It is com- monly assumed that the meaning of Prometheus is "forethinker" (with his bumbling brother Epimetheus as "afterthinker"), but the correct ety- mology of Prometheus is "churner" or "robber."12 Already we can see some interesting connections: Prometheus steals fire from Zeus, and the demons attempt to rob the gods of their divine soma/milk. It is significant to note that Siva, Lord of the Bhutas, including the ganas and pramathas, is also known as the fire god. (The Greek titanos literally means the quicklime made from an earthly element and fire.)13 According to Harper's Dictionary of Hinduism, the pramathas (here the authors' etymology is "tormentor" or "smiter," focusing presumably on manth as "to attack") are first mentioned in the Atharva-veda and are described as demons who are "bearded, terrific, pot-bellied, hunch- backed and dwarfish" and "appear to be the same as the ganas."14 The ganas are under the command of Ganesa, hence one of his names, Ga- napati.15 (Like the yaksas, Ganesa also had a pre-Aryan origin before being appropriated by the Siva cult.) Switching playfully to the divine Nicholas F. Gier 77</page><page sequence="6">side, the ganas are also called ganadevatas, attending not only Siva and Ganesa, but also Indra's court. If our task is to find Hindu equivalents of the Titans, we have certainly not found them in the cute ganas or the ugly pramathas. The raksasas, just as grotesque as the pramathas, fare no better, because they are usually enemies of the human race-for example, King Rama's en- emy Ravana as the most powerful and famous. There is also the story of the demon Raktasura, who "conquered the gods and ruled the triple world."16 He demanded obedience from the other demons, and prom- ised to defend them against the gods. The sacrifices stopped, Indra was weakened, and the demons were able to defeat him. A sexual ruse was once again used to deceive the demons, and they in turn were deposed. The story of Jalandhara is better evidence for our thesis. With the help of both Siva and Brahma, Jalandhara was endowed with tremen- dous powers. He performed childhood miracles, and after he wedded the nymph Vrnda, he established a great kingdom. Seeking to address the injustice of the gods' deception in the churning of the ocean, Jalan- dhara declared war on them. A great battle ensued, the demons got the upper hand, and Visnu intervened, but Jalandhara defeated him as well. Visnu was spared only after his wife LaksmT pleaded for his life. The gods retreated and sought the help of Siva, who fashioned a fearsome weapon, a fiery discus that blinded the gods and singed Brahma's beard. With this awesome tool Siva was able to decapitate Jalandhara. Another story offers more parallels to the Prometheus myth. During the Golden Age, humans were able to travel between earth and heaven at will. One day they ate some barleycorn that belonged to Varuna. As punishment, Varuna, god of waters, inflicted them with dropsy, but Pra- japati "healed them and freed them from Varuna's snare."17 Here one could say that Varuna represents Zeus; and Prajapati, as humankind's advocate, stands for Prometheus. Even more significant for my thesis is the fact that Prajapati, as a successor to the human giant of the Purusa hymn (discussed in section III), is a "god" of a different sort-a Titan, if you will, and not an Angel. It has been argued that Purusa and Prajapati are divinized human forms, and that the Upanisadic successor to both is the holy power (brahman) that had been expropriated-Titan-like-by brahmin priests. One last myth-the exploits of Prthu-will be used to support our thesis. According to the Puranas, Brahma, in answer to the gods' lack of sacrificial food, created kings to establish and protect dharma. The first king, Vena, did not turn out so well, but his son, Prthu, fared better. (Vena shocked his subjects by declaring himself a god, indicating again the presence of the Puranic equivalent of the Hebraic principle.)18 But like the gods, Prthu lusted for power, and his desire took the form of a Philosophy East &amp; West craving for milk (= soma) from NandinT, the sacred cow. In terms of 78</page><page sequence="7">our search for Prometheus equivalents, O'Flaherty's comments are significant: [Prthu] helps to steal this cow (as Prometheus steals the fire from Zeus) in order to help a mortal defy the challenge of the gods, to become free from age and disease-the definitive crime which the jealous Hindu gods cannot tol- erate. (It is ironic that the Indian counterpart of Zeus-Dyaus ... is the would- be thief of immortality.)19 Like Prometheus, Prthu, violating the Hebraic principle, steals divine power, and like the Greek Titan, Prthu saves the human race from a wicked father. It is interesting to note that Vena's rehabilitation and dei- fication (a bhakti innovation) parallels Prometheus' final elevation to Olympus. II The first major conclusion of this study is that Asura Titanism, as the first expression of Hindu Titanism, turns out to be its weakest form. It is weak for two very different reasons. First, of all the beings who have a claim to immortality, it is the asuras who have the strongest case. After all, they were consubstantial with the devas-"we are all of equal birth, the gods and we"20-and the latter's devious ways are at least equally responsible (if not more) for the demons' demise. Second, the revolt and subsequent defeat of the demons was, as we have seen, rather predict- able and anticlimactic. The demons do achieve a few victories, but we all know that the gods will trick them into giving up their hard-won gains. The demonic victories are not that impressive, since the gods in- explicably empower the demons in their rebellion.21 (Brahma and Siva seem bent on aiding the demons, and it is usually Visnu that has to come to the rescue.) The implications are doubly ironic: (1) the beings who have the best claim to heaven do a rather poor job of making good on that claim, and (2) the beings with no natural claim to heaven (viz., hu- man beings) contend, according to many versions of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, that they can achieve divinity on their own power. The other types of Titanism are principally derived from O'Flaherty's "Three Stages of Alignment of Gods, Demons, and Men," which begins with "Vedic Sacrifice (God and Men versus Demons)," followed by a second stage of "Post-Vedic Antiascetic Orthodoxy (Gods versus De- mons and Men)," and the third, bhaktism, in which gods and humans are again reconciled to one another.22 Brahmin Titanism, the second type, is drawn from O'Flaherty's first stage. From her second stage I have derived the third and fourth forms of Titanism: Gnostic and Yogic. O'Flaherty notes that her three stages roughly correspond to the three yogas of the Bhagavad-gTta: karma, jnana, and bhakti. To be accurate, however, there are actually four yogas in the GTta, the fourth being Nicholas F. Gier 79</page><page sequence="8">dhyana yoga. This means that we must distinguish between those who are divinized through meditation (dhyana) and ascetic practices (tapas) and those who claim divinity through knowledge (ijnana; Gk gnosis). The Samkhya-yoga philosophy, therefore, combines both Gnostic and Yoga Titanism-with Samkhya as the jnana system and Yoga representing dhyana. Bhakti Titanism, my fifth and final form, is drawn from O'Fla- herty's third stage, where a human savior takes over the divine prerog- ative of universal redemption. The common thread throughout these five forms of Titanism is a determined-sometimes fanatical, sometimes vio- lent-attempt to acquire spiritual power, the holy power of the gods. The case for Brahmin Titanism is based on the brahmin priests' pro- clamation that they were "gods on earth" or "human gods (manusya- devas)."23 The original offering of the Vedic sacrifice was most likely a human being, with animals and then food and flowers substituted in evolutionary stages. In a provocative article, Brian K. Smith has demon- strated the close connection between eating and power: In the Veda, violence and power-that is, power over another, the power the eater has over food-were celebrated on their own terms.... The texts depict a life where I gain only at your loss, my prosperity entails your ruin, my con- tinued existence depends on your death, my eating requires that you become food.24 Philosophy East &amp; West The main conflict between the gods and demons was concerned with sacred food, and because the brahmin was the only human who could partake of this food, he could make a claim to divinity. As early as the Atharva-veda, one can see the priestly expropriation of the sacred power (brahman) of the Vedas, which the Upanisadic writers then expanded, by their own religious innovation, into Brahman, the Godhead itself.25 This amounts to a subtle, but significant displace- ment of the devas from the center of post-Vedic religion. The surest clue that Brahmanism is post-Vedic and essentially a new religion is the fact that neither the gods nor the demons know who Brahman is.26 O'Flah- erty describes the process aptly: "By performing the sacrifice, [the brah- mins] could ensure the achievement of the [its] ends ... without the participation of the gods at all."27 With the gods in eclipse, the chief antagonists for the priests were the ascetics. Since the greatest threat to the gods came from demons prac- ticing austerities, the brahmins acted like the devas in attacking them. The yogis and the asuras found themselves in an unspoken and unofficial alliance against a sacrificial religion, whose priests despised those who claimed to have divine power outside the prescribed rituals. (The medi- eval church reacted the same way toward its mystics.) But the discovery of the power of ascetic practices gave rise to Yoga and Gnostic Titanism. Again O'Flaherty phrases it nicely: "[the yogi] could achieve a kind of 80</page><page sequence="9">immortality equal or indeed superior to that of the gods, through his own individual efforts."28 Finally, there is Bhakti Titanism, which, I have argued, has its coun- terpart in Christianity.29 One might contend that this must be the weakest form of Titanism, or surely not Titanism at all. In Hindu and Christian bhaktism, God and humans have passed beyond the petty jealousies that characterized earlier forms of religion. The vain devas and the jealous Yahweh have been replaced by a God of Love. The original inter- dependence of Creator and creature is reaffirmed in bhakti-yoga, and everyone, including some demons for evangelical Hinduism, are eligible for salvation. At the end of the next section, I will analyze Krsna's appropriation of the purusa motif and defend the category of Bhakti Titanism. I contend that the fact that human saviors take over the divine prerogative of universal redemption makes this a bona fide form of Ti- tanism. An alternative approach, focusing on the concept of "play" (ITIa) and linking it to Nietzsche, could claim that Krsna has passed beyond the Titan (the "lion" stage of Nietzsche's Three Metamorphoses) to the "child" stage.30 111 A common feature of Titanism in general is the tendency to describe the universe in human terms and form. The most striking examples of the humanization of the cosmos can be found in Indian literature, partic- ularly in one Vedic hymn known as the Purusa hymn. Already we see a Titanistic reversal in that the rsi of the hymn is identified as Narayana (= Visnu), and Purusa himself is the hymn's self-existent God.31 Purusa is the masculine Sanskrit word for "person," and this hymn portrays the birth of the universe in terms of the sacrifice of this cosmic man. Because of this, some commentators have called it a "cosmotheandric" hymn; that is, it assumes the identity of God, man, and the cosmos. I contend, however, that the human element reigns supreme in this cosmic triad. The Purusa hymn proclaims that "Man is this whole universe,-what was and what is yet to be, the Lord of immortality.... This is the measure of his greatness, but greater yet is (primal) Man: All beings form a quarter of him, three-quarters are the immortal in heaven."32 The Titanistic subordination of the world and the gods culminates in the declaration that Indra is born from the Purusa's mouth. The Purusa hymn is reworked in the Atharva-veda, where the de- motion of the gods is well advanced. As builders of the Primal Man, it is easy to imagine them as Lilliputians swarming around the giant body, erecting scaffolding and fashioning the "breast and neck of Man."33 But these godlings are not the real Creator, for we learn that it is Brahman, "the single God [who] put sacrifice in Man."34 The reference to Brah- man, however, is self-reflexive, for "Brahman [as] Man [acquires] this Nicholas F. Gier 81</page><page sequence="10">fire,"35 so the Primal Man is creator of himself. The identity of Purusa and Brahman is clear, when we are given an interesting, but probably bogus, etymology of purusa: Brought forth above, brought forth athwart, All cardinal points did Man pervade,- [Yes, Man] who Brahman's city (pur) knows, By which he is called "Man" (purusa).36 Brahman's city is "radiant... yellow, gold, compassed with glory round about"-just as the Purusa is always described-and the Creator "Brahma has entered in."37 In the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, we find the purusa motif refash- ioned once again: "In the beginning this [universe] was the Self alone,- in the likeness of a man (purusa)."38 In this same brahmana we also see the post-Vedic tension between the sacrifice, which the gods desperately need, and the Upanisadic discovery of the Atman within, which makes the sacrifice unnecessary. "Whoso thus knows that he is Brahman, be- comes this whole [universe]. Even the gods have not the power to cause him to un-Be, for he becomes their own self...."39 In a word (viz., t- man), the gods are being converted to Brahmanism against their will! Here is their complaint: Just as many animals are of use to man, so is each single man of use to the gods. To be robbed of even a single animal is disagreeable. How much more to be robbed of many! And so the [gods] are not at all pleased that men should know this.40 The gods' pleas are in vain, for the new religion of Purusa = Atman = Brahman, and the immediate divine power that it promises, is solidly entrenched: "I worship (purusa) as the pre-eminent, the head and king of all beings. He who worships him as such becomes preeminent, the head and king of all beings."41 In the Svetasvatara Upanisad, we find an incipient personal the- ism-a "Blessed Lord" (identified as Siva) higher than Brahman-de- veloping around the purusa idea: "I know that mighty Person,... beyond Him is nothing whatsoever, no other thing ... the One, the Person, this whole universe full filling!"42 The Purusa hymn is once again rephrased in this third adhyaya. In these passages the divine Person is thoroughly anthropomorphic, but a later passage describes the "one God" as "de- void of attributes."43 Passages from other Upanisads also counter Purusa personalism by describing him as "formless," "other than human," and also as a cosmic horse.44 Returning to the context of the phrase "devoid of attributes," I believe that one can safely interpret this as Samkhya- yoga influence, rather than Vedantist impersonalism. This Purusa is Philosophy East &amp; West described as a spectator-an "overseer ... witness, observer, absolute, 82</page><page sequence="11">alone (kevala), devoid of attributes."45 This is unmistakable Samkhya terminology. A similar passage from the MaitrT Upanisad-"He is indeed the pure, the stable, the unmoved, the unaffected, unflurried, free from de- sire, standing still like a spectator, self-subsistent"46-is connected to a reference to Samkhya-yoga's three gunas. In Samkhya-yoga it is clear that purusas are creaturely souls, not gods, who must take on human form in order to be liberated. Furthermore, the yogi who "attains to ab- solute isolation (kevalatva) ... through self-dependence"47 is not the description of a soul merging with Brahman. Therefore, this strain of Upanisadic Titanism that we have identified contains a very radical view of human autonomy and superiority. In the Kausitaki, the gods flee before the righteous man; and this same man, identified with the Purusa, discovers that he is the "Self of every single being," the "Real," and the "entire universe."48 The TaittirTya tells us that the yogi "attains to independent sovereignty, attains to the lord of the mind," and enjoys a bliss that is a billion times greater than that of the highest gods.49 In the Maitr, the ascetic will surpass Brahman and "will go [yet further], he [will surpass] the gods in the realm of divinity.... "50 What Indian Titans lack in external action and domination, they make up for in elaborate and grandiose internal journeys of conquest and liberation. In the Svetasvatara, they gain incredible powers: "When men shall roll up space as if it were a piece of leather";51 and a yogi in the TaittirTya boasts that "I am the first-born of the world-order, earlier than the gods, in the navel of immortality.... I have overcome the whole world."52 For the Titans of India everything appears possible. These are veritable Hindu supermen. It is in Krsna, however, that the penultimate expression of the purusa motif is conceived. Krsna makes explicit his connection with the Vedic tradition: "Through all the Vedas it is I who should be known, for the Maker of the Vedas' end am I...." and "so am I extolled in Vedic ... speech as ... the 'Person [AII-]Sublime'."53 Krsna declares himself "God of gods," and the "beginning of the gods," and he transcends them so much that they are not allowed to see Krsna's unmanifest form.54 Krsna also reiterates the subordination of Brahman to the Purusa, which we have already seen in the Upanisads: "Great Brahman is to Me a womb, in it I plant the seed: from this derives the origin of all contingent be- ings," and "I am the base supporting Brahman...."55 R. C. Zaehner states that Krsna "transcends the immortal Brahman as much as He transcends the phenomenal world," and he suggests that another translation of ut- tama purusa (lit. "highest" person) is "superman."56 But he chooses in- stead to use "superman" for uttara-purusa, the "higher" person of the Chandogya Upanisad (8.12.3). To use "superman" for both would ob- Nicholas F. Gier 83</page><page sequence="12">scure an all-important distinction between the Upanisadic supermen and Krsna, the supreme Titan. As Zaehner states: "In arrogating this title (ut- tama-purusa) exclusively to Himself Krsna denies it to the liberated in- dividual."57 Stressing this distinction, both he and Robert Minor are determined to reject a nondualistic interpretation that would dissolve all selves into the one divine self.58 What we have, then, is a relation of Krsna to individual selves much like, with the exception of bhakti in- timacy, the relation of the Lord Isvara and autonomous purusas of the Yoga-sutra. O'Flaherty observes that the tensions within her second stage-Post- Vedic Antiascetic Orthodoxy-are resolved either by destroying "the ascetic power of the man or demon" (Brahmin Titanism), or by making "the ascetic man or demon into a god," which leads to Bhakti Titan- ism.59 The origins of the Krsna figure are obscure, but Krsna as divinized ascetic or deified epic hero are two major options. (The earliest refer- ence-Chandogya 3.17.6-identifies him as a student of the guru Ghora Angirasa.) One could argue that Bhakti Titanism is actually a sub- category of the third or fourth forms, where the savior is a yogi or gnostic who has turned from selfish isolation to compassion for all creatures. On this interpretation, Krsna would be an example of "reverse" avatars- like Jesus and Gautama (mortals made highest God)-who take on, in the imagination of their devotees, the salvation of both humans and gods alike. This transformation of Yoga Titanism into Bhakti Titanism is most evident in Mahayana Buddhism. In this section we have covered the development of the Purusa motif from the Rg-veda through the Upanisads to the Bhagavad-gfta. We have seen that there is a clear transformation of the Purusa as a sacrificial victim to a Titan of the universe, a view already implied in the Rg-veda. We have also noted that in the Gfta, Krsna elevates himself as the ulti- mate Purusa, higher even than Brahman, and takes a position equivalent to that of Isvara the Lord. In the next section we will discover that the theme of the Great Yogi continues in the Puranic cosmogony as well. IV Hindu accounts of the fall of human beings generally describe the gods as very anxious about the implications of such a great increase of evil in the world. The logic of Vedic religion was clear: wicked people would sacrifice less so the gods would have less power. But even more threatening to the gods (and the priests who cultivated them) is the ex- istence of human ascetics. O'Flaherty observes that "a priest might le- gitimately emulate the gods, but an ascetic should not. An ambitious priest was like a god; an ambitious ascetic was like a demon."60 The power of performing austerities (tapas) was one that the gods could not Philosophy East &amp; West keep to themselves, as they did the soma sacrifice. Demons and humans, 84</page><page sequence="13">therefore, had equal access to this powerful means of gaining merit and liberation. The reformulation of the Purusa hymn in the Puranas demonstrates the power and significance of Yoga Titanism. Here the divinized person is given the same title-purusottama-as Krsna, but he is also called mahayogin. Madeleine Biardeau contends that this identification of the Purusa as a yogi "is the most important aspect of the primal divinity, who is no longer a sacrificial victim: it is by an act of yoga that he will first set the universe in motion."61 (It is important to note that all the Puranas share this new yogi-centered cosmogony.) Ironically, the Puranas, a vol- uminous literature devoted ostensively to ritual and sacrifice, are sub- verted at their core by a creative agent, who not only represents rejection of Vedic ritual but also hostility to the Hindu gods. Yoga Titanism is found at the heart of texts that inform the daily practice of hundreds of millions of Hindus. To her question "What does this cosmogony mean?" Biardeau answers: In the beginning was yoga, and no longer the sacrifice. The Absolute is that of the yogi.... Yoga thus becomes the supreme value, and the Absolute is that of the yogi.... The starting point for everything, the ground zero of cosmogony, thus takes the form of a projection of the yogi into the absolute.62 It is significant to note that the Samkhya system is firmly embedded in the Puranic cosmogony, so much so that some have called its primary form-an example is Visnu Purana 1.2-a "remythologized" Samkhya.63 The main difference is that Visnu is now seen, as Krsna is in the GTta (7.12; 9.5 ff.), as the creator of both purusa and prakrti. The presence of Samkhya allows us, once again, to thwart a monistic interpretation, one that would dissolve the individual into a divine unity. At the end of the cosmic cycle, prakrti does return to its undifferentiated state, but one can assume that ordinary purusas remain separate from the mahayogin. The Kanphata yogis claim that their sect existed before the creation, and that their guru Gorakhanatth had Brahma, Visnu, and Siva as his first disciples.64 Practicing austerities could generate power equal to or su- perior to that of the gods. An angry glance from an ascetic, for example, could reduce any being to ashes. Kapila, the reputed father of the Sam- khya system, was said to have incinerated 60,000 of King Bhagiratha's ancestors. His connection to Samkhya is due more to Puranic imagina- tion than to history, but it is at least symbolically significant for the thesis of this essay. Another aspect of tapas that frustrated the gods was the fact that the ascetic was usually immune to sexual temptation, the most suc- cessful strategy that the gods had always used against their antagonists. The story of Gautama's rejection of Mara's daughters, and Divodasa's steadfastness in the face of the sixty-four yoginis that Siva sent to seduce Nicholas F. Gier 85</page><page sequence="14">him are good examples. Ironically, Divodasa was finally corrupted by Visnu and his associates disguised as Buddhist missionaries. Again, con- trary to Greek myth, it is the gods, not the Titans, who are addicted to deception. The myth of Divodasa offers yet another instructive parallel to the Prometheus myth. Impressed with his ascetic practices and virtue, Brahma asked Divodasa to rule Benares and save humanity from its sin. Divodasa accepted the offer on the condition that all the gods, including Siva, who had made Benares his home, leave the city and return to heaven. (This is an interesting reversal: Titans usually want to move the gods out of heaven; here the superman, known as the "godless king," commands the gods to return to their proper abode.) Divodasa did as he was instructed: he was so successful in producing virtue in his subjects that the gods became jealous and angry. They retaliated by bringing natural calamities to Benares, but Divodasa, by his ascetic powers alone, was able to make rain, fire, water, and everything else that his kingdom needed. The gods eventually divinized him, primarily, as was the case with Prometheus, to prevent him from ever again upsetting the balance between gods and humans. The Vedic sages were so special that they are sometimes listed as a separate class of beings.65 The rsis were considered to have powers that exceeded those of the gods: Indra's thunderbolt, for example, was made from a sage's bones. Whereas the ascetics gained their power through practicing austerities, the seer-poet attained it through the speaking of mantras. By the use of mantras, the sages "possess[ed] the magic power to conjure up immediate reality-be it in [the] form of gods or in the play of forces."66 Their omnipotence was such that they were said not only to have created all beings-gods, demons, and humans alike-but them- selves as well: for example, both Purusa and Manu were considered self- created. In the Hindu Genesis it is not God who creates, but Svayambhu, the first Manu: "Then the divine Self-existent (Svayambhu himself) in- discernible, (but) making (all) this, the great elements and the rest, dis- cernible, appeared with irresistible (creative) power, dispelling the darkness."67 The desire to become father of oneself is one of the general features of the psychology of Titanism, and humans creating gods has to be the penultimate expression of this radical humanism. The Atharva-veda (4.1.2) calls the human Vena the "Queen of Fathers," creator of Brahma and all the other gods. The great sage Kasyapa gave birth to the gods through his wife Aditi and to the demons by his wife Diti. Kasyapa also sired two races of giants-daityas and danavas-and was also the father of the terrible raksasas. Two daityas-Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa- caused so much trouble that Visnu had to become an avatar twice to Philosophy East &amp; West repair the damage. Hiranyakasipu-an incarnation of Ravana-was able 86</page><page sequence="15">to dethrone Indra with power granted him by Brahma, and Visnu was persuaded to come as a dwarf brahmin, and as such he performed his famous three-step deception. In addition to self-creation, giving birth without the aid of females is also another Titanistic presumption. Promethean churning (our key root manth again) and giving issue from one's mind or thigh seem to be the most common form of male procreation. (Mind-born sons, the ten great sages, are sinless and nonprocreating.) The following sons are said to have been "thigh-born" of their fathers: demons from Brahma's thigh, Vaisyas from Prajapati's, Kutsa from Indra's, a long-awaited son from King Yuvanasva's, Anga (Vena's father) from Uru's, and good Prthu and demonic Nisada from Vena's thigh. (The thigh-born Zeus and Jacob's sons are instructive examples from other mythologies.) In an alternate Prthu story, the sages churn Prthu and his brother into existence, just as they had churned his father Vena out of existence. In the Yoga-sitra, the Lord Isvara is best interpreted as a projection of the perfect human-the yogi himself writ large on a cosmic scale. (The Jain Tirthahkaras explicitly play this role, and we have seen that it be- comes the center of Puranic cosmogony as well.) Mircea Eliade gives the reason for the gods' inferior position: "It is only through experiences that one acquires freedom. Therefore, the gods (videha, 'disincarnate')-who have no experience because they have no bodies-have a condition of existence inferior to the human condition, and as such they cannot attain to total deliverance."68 Again we see the Titanistic insistence that human experience be the norm. The gods are actually defined in a negative way: the disincarnate ones, those beings without bodies. In the Yoga-sutra (I, 19) Patafjali wrote that there are two ways to reach samadhi-the natural way of the gods and the way of technique. Predictably, at least for our thesis, the latter is superior to the former. Eliade describes the yogi's conquest as "cosmicization"-a process of "recasting man in new, gigantic dimensions, of guaranteeing him macranthropic experiences."69 Eliade contends that this process of cos- micization is only temporary, but this cannot be the case. (Zimmer also implies that Hindu Titanism is temporary for the same unfounded rea- son.) The macranthropos is not dissolved into Atman-Brahman, but, as in Jainism, is set free to roam the cosmos, omnipotent, omniscient; but it is also totally isolated and inactive, completely cut off from everything else, including the Lord Isvara, who inspired the yogi to become like him in the first place. The lives of Titans East and West are exceedingly solitary experiences. In his commentary on the Yoga-sutra, Rammurti S. Mishra claims that "deep in the tiny atom of the psyche lies hidden a tremendous force which will lead the psyche to the point of omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence if this force is released properly, systematically, and Nicholas F. Gier 87</page><page sequence="16">chronologically."70 Let me rephrase this claim in terms of nuclear phys- ics, a la Edward Teller: "Deep inside the hydrogen atom lies hidden a tremendous force which will lead humans to the point of omnipotence and omnipresence." This is not totally fair-physical and spiritual power are being conflated-but the principal point is the conceptual con- vergence of Eastern and Western forms of Titanism. Even though Hindu Titanism is a benign form of radical humanism, it nevertheless uses the same language of hubris, power, and conquest as Western Titanism. V W. P. Mei claims that it is the Chinese, more than any "other major world-civilization, that has laid emphasis ... on the cosmic importance of man."71 In the foregoing, I have demonstrated that the Indians have done this as well; but they have not, unfortunately, kept a proper bal- ance, as have the Chinese, between humans, heaven, and earth. In a recent article, David Kinsley points to the fact that the Vedic tradition deified basic natural elements and made mountains and rivers into god- desses. He also mentions the organic, holistic worldview, based on in- ternal rather than external relations, that is contained within Hinduism. And by homologizing the cosmos to the human form, the Hindu sages, according to Kinsley, have given the cosmos great value. Using the Purusa hymn as an example of this organic view, Kinsley does not realize that purusa as human form preempts both heaven and earth. The latter cannot possibly have the intrinsic value that they do in Chinese philosophy. The ecological vision of organic harmony can come only from a worldview in which each member of the cosmic triad has its own independence and integrity. Even in Samkhya-yoga, where prakrti does have its own nature, once human purusas are free from her, she devolves into an inactive, valueless mass. The exclusive Purusa- centric vision of this view is seen in this passage from the Samkhya- Pravcana-sOtra (3.47): "From Brahman down to the blade of grass, the creation is for the benefit of the soul, until supreme knowledge is at- tained." Referring to some of the same passages that I have used to support Hindu Titanism, Kinsley admits that "such hymns might be taken as evidence of spiritual megalomania, delusions of grandeur. However, in the context of Hindu philosophical thought, particularly in the context of the monistic vision of reality, it is clear that they represent redefinitions of 'I' and 'me'."72 If Kinsley means the absolute monism of Advaita Ve- danta, then the holistic and pluralistic web of existence we witness with our five senses is not such a rich fabric at all, but an undifferentiated One. Organic holism loses all of its conceptual power for ecology if it is interpreted in terms of pure nondualism.73 Ramanuja's panentheism- Philosophy East &amp; West just like process theology in the West-is a much better philosophical 88</page><page sequence="17">model. There is a significant contrast between seeing the cosmos as a dream-like appearance (Sarkara) and the cosmos as the very body of the Godhead (Ramanuja).74 The ultimate effect is that absolute monism de- sacralizes the universe, while panentheism resacralizes it. If by "monistic vision of reality" Kinsley means general Upanisadic monism, then he must acknowledge the undeniable presence of Sam.- khya-yoga influence in the Upanisads and the GTta. If the passages are interpreted from this perspective-individual selves are plural, real, and supreme-then it is difficult to avoid Kinsley's diagnosis of "spiritual megalomania." In the final analysis, these Upanisadic and yogic phi- losophies are thoroughly anthropocentric, not theocentric or cosmo- centric. Even Advaita Vedanta leads to "acosmism," as Lance Nelson phrases it."75 Advaitins Krishna Prem and Madhava Ashish continue the Purusa-centric views of Samkhya-yoga: "The divine purpose cannot be effected except through its highest creation, Man.... Man is indeed the measure of all things.... Other than this, divinity has no aim.... Here at last is Man, to whose evolution the totality of universal power has con- tributed."76 Homo mensura, the watchword of Western humanism and Titanism, is just as strong here as it was in Protagoras. Hindu and Christian Titanism appear to meet in Raimundo Panikkar, who suggests that "[man] is in some ways the successor of God, the agent of divinity.... the destiny of God himself is in man's power.... Inasmuch as man is, God is not; insofar as God is, man is not; the one means the absence of the other...."77 This passage implies a strong gods-versus-humans antagonism, and even hints of the atheism of Luth- er's Jesuologie and Vivekananda's overthrowing of the Father by the Son. Even though Panikkar says that his view leads to an "all-embracing cos- motheandric reality," it is Titanism through and through-the cosmos collapses into the human form. A philosophy which puts humans first, be it Western or Eastern, is simply not suited for an ecological vision of reality. As indicated earlier, Chinese philosophy offers the best answer to Eastern and Western Titanism. In his protest against all human activism, Lao-tzu represents an important corrective to radical humanism, but he is ultimately too passive for a proper response to Titanism. The greatest contribution of Taoism to the problem of Titanism is its cosmomorphic and cosmocentric vision. In Taoism we are exhorted to conform our- selves to nature rather than to impose our will on the world. If Western and Indian Titanism overemphasize human autonomy and superiority, nature dominates too much in Taoism. I believe that it is Confucian philosophy that brings the cosmic triad of humans, earth, and heaven into proper balance. Confucius was humble about his own achievements, clearly recognizing the necessity of accepting limits and of concentrating on an earthly moral life. Even Nicholas F. Gier 89</page><page sequence="18">though they are mediators between heaven and earth, Confucian sages are still rooted firmly in the earth, their physical selves, and the body of society. Like artists, Confucian sages seek harmony among human selves and attunement with natural things. Like expert performers, the sages participate in the holy rites of li and are thereby humanized, not divi- nized, by them. Nietzsche's lions assert their rational autonomy and will- to-power; they stand as solitary rebels against society. Indian yogis seek a similar solitary and disengaged existence. Confucian sages, on the other hand, are corporate personalities; they blend in and harmonize; and, with Confucian ITla, they preserve their childlike hearts. In conclusion let us think of Brahma's advice to Divodasa with new ecological meaning: "Enough of this asceticism, my son. By your dharma you have conquered all worlds, now you should protect the world, for there is no other dharma like that."78 NOTES I am heavily indebted to Wendy Doniger and her brilliant work for many quotations, insights, and encouragement.

O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1976), pp. 91-92. In the Philosophy East &amp; West Jaiminfya Brahmana (1.97-98), the gods are so protective of their 90</page><page sequence="19">prerogatives that they deliberately made humans evil so that they would be unable to attain heaven. O'Flaherty also argues that the Vedic separation of gods and humans, not Vedantist monism, pre- vails in the Puranas (Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980], p. 96). 7 - A.

Haldar, Early Buddhist Mythology (New Delhi: Manohar, 1977), p. 149. 10- Rg-veda 1.24.14. All translations (unless otherwise noted) of the Vedas, Upanisads, and Bhagavad-gTta are taken from R. C. Zaeh- ner, Hindu Scriptures (London: J. M. Dent and Sons, 1966). In his thorough study, W. H. Hale argues that the asuras were not a sep- arate class of gods/demons in the early Vedic period. Asura (asu + ra, one who possesses asu-life-power) should be translated in the early literature as "sovereign lord." Both gods and humans took on this title by successfully exercising their powers. Indra as the "slayer of asuras" most likely implies human, not divine, en- emies. According to Hale, after the Aryans had settled in their newly conquered territories, their earlier enemies-the dasyus and the dasas-were then mythologized as demons who battled, Titan- like, with the gods at the beginning of time. Therefore, asuras, either early Vedic or Puranic, can be seen as Titans, i.e., powerful lords-divine, demonic, or human. See Hale, Asura in Early Vedic Religion (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1986). Hale's re- interpretation allows me to use the word "Titan" for humans in the Indian context. 11 - O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil, p. 333.

Eck places most of the Vedic demons under the category of yaksa. Herein she includes raksasas, ganas (hosts or attendants), ganesas (lords of hosts), and female devTs. Siva's connection with these spirits came as a result of his finding a new home for himself and his new wife ParvatT. He chose Varanasi (Benares) as the place, and its indigenous gods helped him remove the king of the city. Ganesa, as Siva's son, seems to be a singular embodiment of the original plural ganesas. See Eck's Banaras: City of Light (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1983), pp. 36, 51, 52, 54. 16 - Quoted in O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil, p. 86. 17- Ibid., p. 22. 18 - Vena boasted that "there is nobody greater than I, and I have none to be worshipped" (Vettam Mani, Puranic Encyclopedia [Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1975], p. 608). 19 - O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil, p. 332. 20- Ibid., p. 71. Coomaraswamy: "Although distinct and opposite in operation, [gods and demons] are in essence consubstantial, their distinction being a matter not of essence but of orientation, revolu- tion, or transformation ("Angels and Titans," p. 373). Keeping Ha- le's thesis (Asura in Early Vedic Religion) in mind, we must not apply this "functional" hypothesis of devas and asuras to the early Vedic period. 21 - There is really no ontological difference between the devas and the asuras, so the only way to make a distinction is to create strife. Therefore, if the gods want to be different from the demons, then it makes sense for them to make the Titanic battles possible. Fur- thermore, since the gods depend on human sacrifice for their sus- tenance, and the best way to get humans to make offerings is to scare them with demons, then it also makes sense not to eliminate the demons altogether. I am again indebted to O'Flaherty for these points (p. 62).

Tantrism in both its Hindu and Buddhist forms is the most powerful expression of radi- cal humanism in the East. 73 - Other commentators have also taken issue with Advaita Vedanta's alleged strength for environmental philosophy. See, e.g., Lance E. Nelson, "Reverence for Nature or the Irrelevance of Nature? Ad- vaita Vedanta and Ecological Concern," Journal of Dharma 16 (3) (July-September 1991): 282-301. Nelson argues that the Advaitin, either before or after liberation, imputes no value whatsoever to the natural world. 74 - Klaus K. Klostermaier sketches an ecological theology based on Nicholas F.
