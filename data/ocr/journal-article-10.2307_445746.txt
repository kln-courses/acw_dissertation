<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHER ALAIN AND FRENCH CLASSICAL RADICALISM RONALD F. HOWELL C. W. Post College of Long Island University HE JUDGMENT that France today still suffers from the French Revolution and the wars of Napoleon I requires no other empirical confirmation than a casual examination of French political history since 1789 will afford. The life of any nation is sustained by its symbols; the French deprived themselves of theirs the moment they escorted King Louis XVI to the guillotine. As symbols of a national consensus, the Marseillaise, the tricolor, and Bastille Day have proved to be quite inadequate substitutes for the Fleur-de-lis and the majesty and pageantry of a royal dynasty, themselves found wanting earlier. For in their political temperament the French have remained both monarchical and republican (radical), never being really certain which of these poses best depicts their true self. The malaise of that republic in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is perhaps most accurately diag- nosed in terms of the psychological effects of periodic oscillations between those two states of mind, with no viable synthesis or midpoint compromise ever attained. The French are reputedly the world's supreme individualists, who dislike the restraint of being governed much more decisively than they lack the knowledge of how to govern. Astonishing it therefore is that nowhere in the English literature that concerns France is there available a full exposition of the political thought of the one man who since the eighteenth century has most vividly exhibited the French political spirit or, more specifically, the spirit of French classical radicalism' during the Third Repub- lic. That man is the philosopher Alain, pseudonym for Emile-Auguste Chartier, who lived from 1868 to 1951.2 Now, it is true that Alain is frequently cited and quoted NOTE: The author acknowledges a great debt to the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Philosophical Society for their generous grants, making possible extensive research in France on contemporary French political and legal philosophy, of which this study of Alain is an indispensable part. Brief general expositions of Alain's life and philosophy for the English-speaking audience are found in the following publications of the author: "An Intellectual Biogra- phy of Alain, in Prospectus," American Philosophical Society Yearbook for 1958 (Phila- delphia, 1959), pp. 441-43; "Alain aux Etats-Unis," Le Bulletin de l'Association des Amis d'Alain (Paris, 1959), Vol. 9, pp. 19-21; "Response to 'Letters of a Wilful Sage,' " The Times Literary Supplement (London, August 29, 1958), p. 483; "Alain en Ameri- que; Biographie Intellectuelle d'Alain," Le Bulletin de l'Association des Amis d'Alain (Paris, 1960), Vol. 11, pp. 25-26; "Emile Chartier Becomes Alain," Emory University Quarterly, 16 (Spring 1961), 13-23. For the best introduction to Alain in French, see his Histoire de Mes Pense'es (Paris, 1936) and the Pl6iades edition of selected Propos (Paris, 1956), which editor Andre Maurois praises as "one of the most beautiful books in the world."

All translations from French sources in this article are the author's. 1 French classical radicalism was par excellence the radicalism of Alain; its characteristics will emerge from the article. 2 Alain was born in Mortagne-au-Perche (Orne), where his father was a veterinary. After ele- mentary studies under the direction of priests, he entered the Lycie d'Alencon in 1881. He completed work for the Bachelier ?s Lettres at Caen in 1886, and from 1886 to 1889 he was a student of Jules Lagneau at the Lyc6e Michelet in Vanves. Enrolled at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris from 1889 to 1892, he was awarded the Licenci6 es Lettres in 1890, the Bachelier es Sciences in 1891, and Aggr6gation de Philosophie in 1892. He was thereafter professor successively at the Lyc6e de Pontivy (1892-1893), the 594</page><page sequence="2">ALAIN AND FRENCH CLASSICAL RADICALISM 595 in British and American books on political science, particularly those on comparative government. Usually, however, only his "radicalism" is mentioned, and the content of even that "radicalism" is not adequately or clearly disclosed. In Great Britain and the United States, Alain is simply not known. This neglect, if not countered, will continue to leave a hiatus in the knowledge of every Britisher and American who aspires to understand the French situation today. The modest purpose of the present article is to offer an expository analysis of Alain's political thought in the context of his over-all philosophy and its affinity with French classical radicalism. Except incidentally, detailed criticism, favorable or censorious, falls outside the purview of the study. What Alain thought is the primary interest here; the reader may determine for himself the cogency, the persuasiveness, the contemporaneity, and the validity of his arguments. Embarrassing to admit, Alain has fared markedly better outside the English- speaking world. His works, encompassing nearly every sphere of human thought and activity, are contained in over sixty published volumes,3 many of which have been translated into German, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, and almost all into Japanese!4 Yet only one of these, Mars ou la Guerre Jugee, has found its way into English, in a translation that is extremely poor. On the other hand, Alain's importance in French letters and pedagogy was acknowledged in a leading (page one) article in The Times Literary Supplement as recently as August 1, 1958. After recognizing that "Alain was, in the first place, a teacher - by far the most famous one in France between 1919 and 1933," the Supplement continued: Lyc6e de Lorient (1893-1900), the Lyc6e de Rouen (1900-1902), the Lyc6e Condorcet, then the Lyc6e Michelet (1902-1909), the Lyc6e Henri-Quatre (1909-1914 and 1917-- 1933). The first article of Emile Chartier signed "Alain" appeared in the radical news- paper, Dpe^che de Lorient, in 1900. Numerous publications, later cited, appeared in rapid order. From 1914 to 1917 Alain served in the French Army (heavy artillery) ; he was wounded and hospitalized in 1916. He died at Le V6sinet, a suburb of Paris, in 1951, less than a month after receiving the Grand Prix National des Lettres. ' Of these, all published in Paris, the most important are: Spinoza (1901), Les Marchands du Sommeil (1919), Propos d'un Normand (three volumes), Les Berthelot (1919), Libres Propos (1921-28), L'Emancipation (1923), Les Cent un Propos d'Alain (1908-14), Vingt et un Propos d'Alain (1915), Propos Sur l'Esthetique (1923), Propos sur le Chris- tianisme (1924), Jeanne d'Arc (1925), Propos sur le Bonheur (1928), Elements d'une Doctrine Radicale (1925), Le Citoyen contre les Pouvoirs (1926), Sentiments, Passions et Signes (1926), Esquisses de l'Homme (1927), Propos sur l'Education (1933), Propos de Litterature (1934), Propos de Politique (1934), Propos d'Economique (1935), Les Saisons de l'Esprit (1937), Propos sur la Religion (1938), Minerve ou de la Sagesse (1939), Convulsions de la Force (1939) ,Echec a&amp; la Force (1939) ,Pre'liminaires a l'Estheti- que (1939), Vigiles de l'Esprit (1942), Humanites (1946), Politique (1952), Quatre- Vingt un Chapitres sur l'Esprit et les Passions (1917), Elements de Philosophie (1941), Systeme des Beaux Arts (1920), Mars ou la Guerre Jugee (1921), Lettres au Dr. Henri Mondor sur le Sujet du Coeur et de l'Esprit (1924), Souvenirs Concernant Jules Lagneau (1925), Liber Amicorum Romain Rolland (with others, 1926), Les Ide'es et les Ages (1926-27), La Visite au Musicien (1927), Les Sentiments Familiaux (1927), Etude sur Descartes (1928), Rene' Descartes, Traite' des Passions (1928), Onze Chapitres sur Platon (1928), Paul Vale'ry, Charmes (1926), Definitions (1953), Entretiens au Bord de la Mer (1949), Vingt Lecons sur les Beaux Arts (1931), Iddes: Platon, Descartes, Hegel (1932), Idefes (Introduction a la Philosophie): Platon, Descartes, Hegel, Auguste Comte (1939), Les Dieux (1934), Stendhal (1934), En Lisant Balzac (1935), Avec Balzac (1937), Histoire de Mes Pensees (1936), Souvenirs de Guerre (1937), Entretiens Chez le Sculp- teur (1937), Pr~liminaires a la Mythologie (1943), Les Adventures du Coeur (1945), En Lisant Dickens (1945), Lettres t Sergio Solmi sur la Philosophie de Kant (1946).

Alain, as a matter of fact, helped to create this conviction not, of course, by placing himself on a level with the other four, but by praising Val6ry, Claudel, and Proust in such a way as to imply that no other writers were worth bothering about. (For reasons which remain unexplained, he had no patience with Gide . . .) The Big Five are now all dead and each of the first four has, pro- visionally at least, been settled in a niche. Only Alain remains unplaced.' Even Alain's own countrymen have conceded the vexing difficulty of properly appraising and "placing" him within the French philosophic tradition. The fact that throughout his life he refused to categorize himself or to accept the categoriza- tion of others may in part explain why his works are of such perennial interest and value. Nominally a professor of philosophy, un professeur de khdgne, in several lycees and finally at the Lyc6e Henri-Quatre in Paris, Alain was always a great teacher.6 The subject-matter of his teaching did not really matter; he could discourse with equal agility and insight on philosophy or politics or literature or music or economics or religion or mathematics or the physical sciences. He was truly a man of virtu', akin to the highly versatile and profoundly humanistic Renaissance man of parts. Life he would never compartmentalize; to do so was ultimately to destroy its meaning. In his words, "I am certain . . . that all truths would perish in a system of truths." 7 Hence, any attempt (except for purely analytical purposes) to isolate and label his philosophic orientation or his literary criticism or (especially) his political thought would do major violence to his own stated intent. Alain can be wedged into no classi- fiable slot prearranged either by the conservatism of tradition or the revolutionary nature of those passing intellectual fads to which others of his time succumbed. Per- haps it is enough to say that he was "a radical," a philosopher, and the Third Repub- lic's "moralist of liberty." s I It is thus more appropriate to speak of Alain's political thought than of his political theory. Theory implies unity and system; Alain's thought was not, and indeed he never meant it to be, unified and systematic. Although he was the author of many works employing a "standard" prose style, the principal genre through which he expressed his ideas in effect precludes the construction of theory qua uni- fied, coherent system. That genre is the propos, a restricted prose form resembling a short newspaper feature article with editorial comment. More precisely, an Alain propos is a proposition for discourse, a brief thesis tersely conveyed, a scholarly chat, a sketch, an essay-vignette, a provocative commentary written on almost every con- SBut see Pierre Bost, "Histoire et LUgendes," Hommage a Alain, La Nouvelle Revue Franqaise (Paris, 1952), p. 41. Alain never really liked Proust, and he was introduced to the works of Val6ry by his students. He later met Valbry personally, however, and wrote com- mentaries on Valbry's poems, Charmes (1929), and La Jeune Parque (1936). (For a revealing character study of Alain and the Val6ry at their first meeting, "le de'jeuner chez Laperouse," see Henri Mondor, Alain (Paris, 1953), pp. 140-86.) As for Alain's opinion of Gide, Bost states: "I do not believe that I ever heard him mention Gide's name." 8 Among Alain's students who became prominent names in France and the world in a diversity of vocations are Simone Weil, Jean Prevost, Pierre Bost, Henri Massis, Andr6 Maurois, Samuel de Sacy, Maurice Savin, Maurice Toesca, Michel Alexandre, Jeanne Michel- Alexandre, and Maurice Schumann.

It recalls in its more elongated form a maxim of La Rochefoucauld and in its briefer compass an essay of Montaigne. It has been compared to the type of sonnet that proceeds from a reflection on particulars to the tentative statement of a universal.9 And because of its non-technical language, its rich imagery, its familiar and often earthy examples, its classical allusions, and its polyphonic prose, it is analo- gous to unversed poetry generally.10 Alain rigidly limited the length of a propos, which for many years he wrote daily for French provincial newspapers (more often than not against the "Parisian elite"), to two handwritten pages (about fifty lines). He made virtually no revisions of the first draft; rather than correct, he began anew. Because the propos is thus circum- scribed, indicating a predilection for strict form in the rationalistic, neoclassic herit- age of the Enlightenment, much is necessarily left unsaid, unexplained, unsystematic, paradoxical, elliptical, enigmatic, laconic, merely suggested, or implied. Accordingly, the ramifications of a discrete idea could not possibly be developed in any one propos. Observable, nevertheless, from the total corpus of his works, those sixty-odd volumes, is a consistent thread of interpretation of political and other matters. Andr6 Maurois, probably Alain's most celebrated student, has pointed out that while Alain was pur- posefully unsystematic, he did express with constancy, throughout his life, "certain preferences and dislikes." To be sure, there is considerable repetition in Alain's writ- ing, and partly by design. He complained that though everything has been said, little has been heard, so everything must be said at least twenty times again. Such repetition ought not to be denigrated. Its positive merit in underscoring an enduring commitment to certain fundamental ideas (constants, universals) surely outweighs the negative criticism that Alain belabors those ideas to the point of prolixity. Further, Alain writes more in the style and spirit of the older French politiques et moralistes, the counterpart of moral philosophers in eighteenth-century England, than in that of contemporary political scientists. (He has been variously acclaimed as a twentieth-century Montaigne or Montesquieu or Voltaire.) His political terms are often nebulously defined, primarily because he had no interest in giving them specific substantive content. That he would have had an honest dislike for the recent "scientific" direction of a segment of American political scientists is attested by Jacques Brenner's statement that "Alain's distrust of 'proofs' was reinforced by political and economic [scholars] who pretended to reason with the rigor of mathe- maticians and physicists." 11 His own political concepts are sometimes dogmatically advanced, but this is so because he was faithful to a pungent formula of his own personal political creed: one must make a choice among political value-alternatives early in life and then unswervingly hold fast to that choice.12 (That such a position augurs a rather static Weltanschuuang cannot be lightly dismissed.)

Alain also writes impressionistically; in any concise resume of his thought, the impressions have to be pinned down, arranged, and ordered (at least mentally) by the critic. A propos, though aesthetically well- contoured within its restricted limits, often leaves an idea open-ended and dangling. Fortunately, in copious later propos, Alain returns to the idea to dissect and embellish it further, though rarely definitively. It is impossible to understand, analyze, synthesize, systematize, and then evaluate Alain's political thought except in collation with the totality of the propos that touch on his analysis of the political order. It is equally impossible to assess his political thought except within the perspective of the totality of his general philosophy. Gen- eral philosophy, as Alain taught and wrote it,13 was sufficiently broad in compass to embrace every human endeavor. From that totality the generating Ilan of a meta- physical, epistemological, and ethical persuasion may be discerned, supplying the root premises from which his political thought implicitly develops. II According to Alain, any attempt to effectuate a separation, whether meta- physically or epistemologically, between la pensee (thought) and l'action (action) is neither viable, valid, nor realistic. Thought and action cannot be dichotomized. The problems engendered by purely abstract thoughts are simply those that admit of no solution, no passage to the active, actual world. Such a belief might eventuate in a "law" of causality according to which "every reasonable man recognizes necessity in things, on the theory that everything is connected to everything else, as the tides to the moon." 14 Alain refused to concede the affinity of such a statement with the pantheistic determinism of Spinoza. For though confessedly skeptical and doubting - doubting what is certain being more crucial than doubting what is doubtful, he remained an optimistic apostle of freedom, if not freedom in the processes of nature, assuredly freedom in man's confrontation with those processes. From his own highly esteemed professor, Jules Lagneau,'5 at the Lyc6e Michelet at Vanves from 1886 to 1889 (the time of Boulangism), Alain had decided that the mind (spirit) orders concrete objects, but always in the immediate or potentially immediate presence of those concrete objects. This decision would appear to parallel a conclusion of the subjective idealism of Kant, whose philosophy Alain lavishly praised and even explicated in a short book, Lettres a' Sergio Solmi sur la Philosophie de Kant. In the revolutionary Critique of Pure Reason, Kant had pronounced ex cathedra: "In respect of time ... no knowledge of ours is antecedent to experience, " Samuel de Sacy, "Topo. Disciple. Philosophe," Hommage a Alain, loc. cit., p. 46, explains that Alain's purpose "was not to make the philosophy of the sky descend to the earth, but to establish and maintain a circuit of good conductibility between the earth and the philosophic sky." 14 Alain, Souvenirs Concernant Jules Lagneau (Paris, 1925), p. 27. (Hereafter cited SCJL.) ' Alain always spoke of Lagneau in deferential and reverential terms. "The only great man that I have ever met." (SCJL, p. 7); "To speak truthfully, the only God that I have known." Andr6 Maurois, Alain (Paris, 1950), p. 12.</page><page sequence="6">ALAIN AND FRENCH CLASSICAL RADICALISM 599 but begins with it. But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all arises out of experience." 16 Note, however, the amendment proposed by Georges Pascal in his exposition of Alain's philosophy: Idealism is true if it means only that the world is at each instant a construction of the spirit, but it is unacceptable if it pretends to make the world a contingent matter whose very existence would depend on the spirit. Common sense rebels against such a fantastic doctrine that reduces existence to a human decree. Essence, not existence, is of the spirit. The world is nothing but an immense and indivisible existence that appears to the spirit as chaos which must be ordered." Hence follows the standard that Alain appropriated from Lagneau: "la pensde est la mesureuse." s18 Thought is the measuring instrument for ordering external existence, as Anaxagoras had argued in pre-Socratic times, and "the spirit is nothing more than an ensemble of a priori ideas." 19 Ideas must relate to experience, how- ever, and in a Kantian way. Lagneau had lectured that "there is no [purely] sub- jective knowledge." 20 There are ideas because there are things for there to be ideas about. Ideas are "the pincers for seizing the objects of experience." 21 It is only the modes of ordering, e.g., space and time, that are not contingent upon and not known by human experience. Otherwise, object and subject are necessarily related: una eademque res. As Alain explains, "we formulate ideas only in the actual perception of an object." 22 Yet apart from the modes of ordering, may there be an idea with which an actual human perception has never been associated? The idea of God? Alain, intrepidly anticlerical and forsaking formal religion at the age of twelve, once confided: "I sometimes think that if I had never thought about God in some way, I would not have thought at all." 23 An appreciation of Alain's theological position, cryptically complex, is some- what difficult to communicate intelligibly. In the first place, he would deny as fallacious the assumptions of an anthropomorphic deity and of personal immortality. Second, "God cannot be said to exist." 24 Now, this is not the same as saying there "is" no God. Existence is a purely human construct of all that is external to man in nature. If God "is" "anything," His properties cannot be described in finite human terms. If there "is" a God, then by apodictic definition He must be trans- human, transmundane, transspatial, transtemporal, transcausal, trans everything perceived as existence. "To prove the existence of God is to deny Him." 25 (Alain, in fact, was highly skeptical of the possibility of proving anything.) God, therefore, is not existence; He is essence. "Existence is hypothesized by essence," 26 and "eternity is the mirror of time." 27 18 Critique of Pure Reason (Everyman edition; London: Dent, 1934), p. 25. 17 Pascal, op. cit., pp. 40, 41. 1 HMP, p. 25. 19 Pascal, op. cit., p. 47. 20 SCJL, p. 34. 21 HMP, p. 86. 22 Alain, Les Idles et les Ages (Paris, 1927), Vol. I, p. 106. 2 HMP, p. 25.

Using his favorite pedagogical method, clarum per obscurius28 (clarify by obscuring), Alain (pace Plato) entices his reader to find his own way out of the cave. So, as Auguste Comte had demonstrated, poly- theism precedes monotheism: "If I could think of all the gods as being in God and as God, all the gods would be true." 29 External existence, unlike active, willing, judging essence (God, esprit) that abides in man, is nature. And "nature is iner- tia," 30 known only as phenomena and only through the forms of thought when the forms of thought have coherently ordered it. Order is thus subsequent to chaos, the superior (episteme: knowledge) to the inferior (doxa: opinion), Christianity to paganism, philosophy to theology,31 the ellipsis (Kepler) to the circle (Copernicus), music to noise, adults to children, free men to slaves, the republic to the monarchy, Alain to Emile-Auguste Chartier. The map to Alain's epistemology, inextricable from his metaphysics, is perhaps now more decipherable despite the subtle detours indicated. Basically, it is Cartesian: I think, therefore I am - and I am free. The will to think makes freedom deter- mined. Man is free when he acts, and his actions are willed by la pense'e. To think is to construct - that is, to act. Thinking is as much an "act" (action, activity) as the visible, concrete act in which thinking, prompting will into motion, may abide. The concrete, manifested, experiential, and observable act, though chronologically suc- cessor to thought, is finally an integral and inseparable aspect of thought, just as thought is an integral and inseparable aspect of the act. "The universe of things is also a fact of thought." 32 Ordo et connexio idearum and ordo et connexio rerum are but facets of the same reality, as Spinoza had cogently reasoned. The Aristotelian metaphysical premise universalia in re Alain here reaffirms. Thought directing the will (e'lan) incites, advances, and enhances the act and serves as its terminal criterion. Alain's implication, however, is emphatically not that the philosopher is thereafter obliged to arrange thoughts, ideas, "truths" in a logical and hierarchical system, even if the system could then withstand empirical tests for validation. Far from it, he warns. Life cannot thus be bound. Curiously, Alain's own personal life was almost as narrowly regimented by methodical routine as was Kant's, and the propos is an aptly tangible examplar of his self-permission to roam at will philo- sophically, but only within self-prescribed cognitional limits and inflexible stylistic rules. Beneath this most highly generalized perspective, from his own Mount Olympus, Alain subsumed his ideas on the more specific topics of politics, literature, economics, religion, music, painting, the physical sciences, and education. Always he credited Lagneau with having inculcated in him the desire to think, and to think freely. Prob- ably, then, free judgment (le jugement libre), perception (la perception), and will (la volontd) constituted the matrices of Alain's philosophy, nascent but emerging 28Ibid., p. 65. 29 Maurois, op. cit., p. 107. 30 Ibid., p. 58.

Even as a young man he had recognized that independence of judgment, perception, and will presupposes a lively acceptance of personal responsibility: To safeguard that power to think, not to submit it to anything, not to dishonor it by any kind of intoxication - is not that the true moral philosophy, my Master? ... Perhaps he [Lagneau] might return to remind me that the true moral philosophy does not have as its primary objective the judgment of others, but rather the self-control of oneself.33 III From his metaphysical and epistemological "doctrine de la volontd" Alain derived his ethical and political thought, which, written with reference to activities of the will (made aware by perception and guided by judgment), is devoted pri- marily to a surgical dissecting of the component parts of his concepts of personal and political liberty. These are the concepts he emphasized in all of what are somewhat incorrectly designated as his ethical and political writings. Yet political liberty is ancillary to personal (moral) liberty. Indeed, political liberty can legitimately be attained only insofar as the exercise (by will) of personal liberty evokes reliable guidelines for judgment. For to Alain personal liberty does not mean freedom from external restraint so decidedly as it means obedience to the internal restraint and discipline that an individual freely imposes upon himself. That this view should seem essentially Rousseauistic (and certainly Kantian) is not surprising in view of the acknowledged debt that Alain professed he owed to "that French-speaking Swiss with the most German of hearts." 34 "Rousseau," he admitted, "was always my master." "5 Alain's concept of personal liberty is grounded in the postulate that one should not submit to his own whimsical and capricious passions. Rather, he should recog- nize his duty to the internal order of his reason. One is truly and genuinely free only in the thought and the act of refusing to surrender as a slave to the domination of his partial and thus prejudicial self-interests. Political liberty is meaningless and value- less if it is not regarded as a prize less worthy to be won than personal liberty, or ethical victory over one's self. It is better to bow before a political tyrant than to acquiesce in capitulation to the larger tyranny of one's own personal, particularistic desires. Alain here concurs with Kant that the personally free individual must be the successfully self-legislating individual. Self-realization comes through self-limitation, and happiness is the byproduct of the fulfillment of duty. Hence: "Today, even more than in earlier times, I understand how the doctrine of Duty supports the doctrine of 33 SCJL, p. 58. 34 Peter Viereck, Metapolitics (New York: Putnam, 1961), p. 22. * HMP, p. 62. Alain considered himself "almost as faithful to Rousseau as to Plato." (P. 63.) But was he? If Rousseau's elusive General Will may be defined as society's (including all its individuals') willing to act the way it would act if it willed to act the way it should act, then an individual, obeying his particular will at odds with the General Will, might have "'to be forced to be free," as Rousseau states categorically in Du Contrat Social (Classiques Garnier edition; Paris, 1954), p. 246. It is highly doubtful that Alain would agree with this conclusion, just as it is signally improbable that he would ever concur in a theory of an organic state, to which Rousseau's General Will, according to one major interpretation, inevitably leads. See Simone Petrement, "Une Politique pour Tous les Temps," Hommage a Alain, loc. cit., pp. 138-54.</page><page sequence="9">602 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY Liberty." 36 The individual's dutiful confrontation with, and effective vitiation of, the willfulness of his intrinsic nature is therefore the focal point of reference and departure for understanding his relationship to those who are his governors in the impersonal state. Alain's ethics37 exalted the "integrity" and the "decency" of individual freedom, coupled with mandatory, thought usually personally objectionable and disrespectful, social responsibility. His prescription? Criticize resolutely and energetically, yet obey unsullenly. Recognize that minimal social order demands limitations on overt politi- cal activity, but permit no restraint on freedom of thought and expression. The greater the freedom of thought and its expression, operative in something like John Stuart Mill's "market place of ideas," the greater the likelihood that the "best" people will rule in a democracy. The ideal politics is the politics of criticism and resistance and control. In one of the most typical and memorable passages of all his political propos, Alain trenchantly proclaims: "Resistance and obedience, those are the virtues of the citizen." 38 Obedience insures order; resistance insures liberty. But order and liberty are not separable; they are correlatives rather than opposites. Liberty cannot exist without order, and order is worthless without liberty. "To obey while resisting, that is the whole secret. Whatever destroys obedience is anarchy; whatever destroys resistance is tyranny. . ... Obey physically, never spiritually." 39 This is the incisive thematic advice of Alain's "radicalism." In that radicalism, both the monarchical and republican sides of his political temperament merge, complement, and act as catalysts one for the other, with no violation of consistency. In a certain indirect sense Alain was a monarchist. He enjoyed recalling that voters in his native Perche voted "royalist," not because they favored the return of a king, but because their mere act of voting against "republi- cans in power" made them obstinate republicans. His own humble lifelong aspira- tion was: "rester peuple," "rester simple soldat," to live his life as a courageous pacifist, a relentless opponent of all forms of militarism and human oppression, close in memory to the rustic peasant soil of his Normandy birthplace, possessing "the Stoic serenity of an Epictetus," 40 and displaying the quiet patience and the stern will of "un boeuf laboreur." 41 Maurice Savin, one of Alain's best-known students, probes deeply: There was something of the spirit of Monarchy in him, about which he was not ashamed. A Republican of the purest sort, yes, and even fiercely so. But Monarchy first of all, just as noise precedes music; and the Republic would be nothing without the Monarchy, which was a natural thought to him, just as it is natural to our country, which is a country of insurgent peasants. There was a peasant spirit in Alain, and he did not hide it: a rejection of all the nonsense in fashion, a native resistance, undiminishable, to everyone who promises the moon and all the pleasures of civilization without [first enduring] a peasant austerity?

Never departing from the conviction so deeply imprinted on his thought from childhood that one must not be unctuous or sycophantic towards those in political authority, he "ridiculed the clever speech- makers and their platitudes, which so often went unquestioned." 43 He had no wish "to deify society." 44 Any "master" is an enemy; thought must therefore be kept free and flexible; a perfect society on earth is an extravagantly absurd chimera, the ideal of an infantile human mythology. Alain was therefore certainly no revolutionary or fanatical anarchist. He had no desire to replace one political system with another, one set of rulers with another. A change in the form or functions or personnel of political institutions does not auto- matically improve the government; usually a change occasions not progress but retro- gression. Even so, to criticize and censure government is an indisputable prerogative (libre arbitre) of the individual - to be exercised even during the very act of obey- ing. Alain insisted unexceptionally on the necessity of protecting the freedoms of judgment, perception, and will of the unfettered human spirit. The individual must exercise an unrestrained free will in evaluating political, social, religious, and eco- nomic ideas and institutions, even if the result be nonconformity, "the noncon- formity that is itself the genius of the [French] race, the concern for the worth and the dignity of man, the informed awareness of the dangers of power and of the im- perativeness of controlling it." 4" Such intense, uncompromising individualism is the cornerstone of Alain's radicalism. IV French classical radicalism, which received its intellectual cast and tone from Alain, was a philosophical movement long before its institutional espousal by that identifiable political party whose ranks included Combes, Clemenceau, Herriot, Daladier, and Mendis-France. (Alain considered Auguste Comte "the father of French radicalism." 46) The Radical party (and the Radical-Socialists), while the oldest of contemporary parties in France and the country's most important and most powerful left-wing group until 1936, was not founded until 1901. In considerable measure, the history of the Third Republic after the Seize Mai defeat of General MacMahon in 1877 was the history of radicalism, and the chief philosopher of radi- calism was Alain. Whereas Alain, who eschewed doctrines himself, wrote in 1925 a kind of prolegomenon for radicalism entitled Elements d'une Doctrine Radicale, the party itself was never committed to any doctrinaire set of political specifics. "Politi- cally progressive but socially conservative," it saw as its task "to build" the Republic from the blueprint of the "immortal principles of 1789." 47 Radicalism, then, was an itat d'esprit, not a statement of a party program. This itat d'esprit was nonetheless 43 M. Didier, "Discours sur Alain," ALA, p. 29. 4 Ibid. 45 Ibid.

It is there that I say my prayers."

Implicit was the belief that political institutions must be rooted in small natural societies, such as the family, the village, the farm, and small individual busi- nesses and professions. In its dedication to the protection of local interests, it stood intransigently against "the State" and the Paris political, cultural, and economic monopoly.48 At the same time, it stood defiantly against "the Church," and its intensive, embittered anticlericalism (for Father Combes the essential ingredient of radicalism), particularly after the Dreyfus Affair, led straightway to the passage of the Separation Act of 1905. Belated efforts of the Roman Catholic church hier- archy to make certain liberal amends were unavailing. Francis de Tarr has written of members of the Radical party: They have stressed their love of country and their respect for private property; they have defended Individualism, Democracy, and the Republic; they have rejected both Catholicism and Marxism which, they complain, place Church and State above the individual and demand conformity to a revealed body of doctrine; they have identified the Radical Party with the Republic and with France.4 These "preferences and dislikes" were of course wholly consistent with Alain's own subjective principles, and his works became the vehicle for succinctly purveying radical ideas. As Jean Touchard has noted, "above all, Alain is against. Against the prince, against the chateaux, the academies, important personages, against the administration, against militarism and against war, against the Church, against polit- ical powers." 50 An inveterate enemy of all sham and hypocrisy, of all pomp and circumstance, of all the "merchants of sunshine," 51 Alain refused a chair of phi- losophy at the Sorbonne, refused membership in academic, literary, and political associations, refused every academic and literary honor proffered him except one to gratify his friends a few weeks before his death. He was the citoyen contre les pouvoirs,52 who envisaged the special mission of the Radical party to be the party of governmental opposition. Understandably, the Radical party claimed Alain as its own. Even today, "the halls of Radical congresses always include banners that quote some of his memorable slogans; to the Comite' Exe'cutif of the Radical Party, a party official [Antonin Douzet] described him, in 1949, as 'the greatest of modem phi- losophers.' " 53 Elsewhere, Douzet recalled Andr6 Maurois's prediction that "in a hundred years people will speak of Alain as they spoke of Descartes a century after his death." 54 Alain's impress on the political culture of France is kept indelible by the ubiquitous presence of new editions of his books at Radical party headquarters and by the activities and the publications of L'Association des Amis d'Alain at Le V6sinet, in suburban Paris.

Pronounced governmental instability was the hallmark of French political life until the demise of the Third Republic in 1940. The antagonistic rela- tionship of the legislature and the executive culminated in legislative supremacy in face of almost every important policy decision. And within the legislature, within the frenetic Chamber of Deputies and the dilatory Senate, large groups did not con- ceal the fact that they were unassuageable enemies of the Constitution, prepared to commit violent and irrational acts against the regime. The two traditions in French political culture remained unreconciled and, it seemed, irreconcilable. The Con- stitution of the Third Republic blatantly signified a truce, not a compromise between those two traditions. They were mythically couched in the metaphors of the Red and the Black, the Black representing the dark forces of monarchical, authoritarian, bureaucratic, Bonapartist, and ecclesiastical reaction, the Red exalting the humane, republican, libertarian, egalitarian, and radical principles of 1789. Yet oddly, despite the divisive individualism of the French people, the two in varying degrees seem still at war in every Gallic soul, accounting perhaps for the ambivalent attitude of Frenchmen towards political authority. As Nicholas Wahl has lucidly argued, the Frenchman prefers to have decisions made centrally by some impersonal and presumably expert but distant au- thority. Thus one of the reasons advanced for the long maintenance of the centralized bureauc- racy created by Napoleon is simply that Frenchmen approve of having many delicate political decisions made for them by experts in order to assure some sort of abstract justice. It explains, too, why there has never been more of a movement in favor of autonomous local government in France. On the other hand, Frenchmen are also very eager to protect their individual liberty of action, to prevent abuses of power by the centralized political authority, and to have a con- stant veto over its decisions.' Astutely aware of the prevalence of this ambivalent attitude, Alain characteristically admonished his countrymen to obey silently, but to reprove and resist audaciously. To reprove and resist and control is the function of le Contrdleur (connoting more than the English word "controller"), which Alain finds to be French democracy's (or any democracy's) most impermeable shield for protecting liberty. V The concept of le Contr6leur, which significantly reveals so much about Alain's political thought, is introduced by the rather obvious remark that democracy cannot exist "by itself" (any more than "can politics save itself") 56 - that is, in its pure (classical) form. In every constitution, there are elements of monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy, held (ideally) in relative equilibrium. Unfortunately, true mixed government, boasting that relative equilibrium of the three forms, as in the United Kingdom,'5 did not exist in the Third Republic of France. Indeed, Wahl has main- Nicholas Wahl, "The French Political System," in Samuel H. Beer and Adam B. Ulam (eds.), Patterns of Government (New York: Random House, 1962), p. 281.

(Hereafter cited CEFH.)</page><page sequence="13">606 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY tained: "Mixed government has never existed in France because the aristocratic principle of command and the democratic principle of consent, instead of becoming blended within each institution and thus assuring balance and cooperation among them, individually became fully embodied in different and ultimately antagonistic institutions." 58 Principally accepting a modified Polybian schema of mixed government or the mixed constitution, in which status and class orders in society parallel and are re- flected in functional branches of government, Alain finds the monarchical element manifested in the executive branch and the oligarchic in the legislature. The demo- cratic element, however, is not located in a specific branch of government, but rather in le ContrGleur, "which Political Science has in no way defined." 59 And what is le Contr6leur? Alain's reply is that it is "nothing more than the continually effective power of deposing kings [ministers] and specialists [bureaucrats] at the very moment when they no longer manage affairs according to the interests of the greatest number. The power was long exercised in revolutions and barricades. Today, it is exercised by means of Interpellation ... the endless effort of the governed to oppose the abuses of power." 60 Le Controleur thus stands always suspiciously and skeptically on guard, and democracy becomes a system of diligent surveillance of the voters over the elected: of the people over the deputies ("controlled controllers"), of the deputies over the ministers. Alain consistently exhibited a deep and enduring faith in democratic govern- ment, as he defined it. A vital element in his definition was a doctrine of equality, which served him well first in gauging and then in contesting the presumptuousness of all "les Importants" of society.61 But a doctrine of equality of rights and re- sponsibilities is by no means democracy's only essential. A monarchy or a tyranny can be democratic in this way, "with many obligations and few rights" 62 shared equally. Offering an explanation reminiscent of that of Hobbes and Rousseau, Alain continues: "If liberty of thought existed for no one, that fact in itself would suggest a kind of equality." 63 A "politics of nature" underlining the truism that every society must be governed is to be distinguished from a "politics of the spirit" demanding that freedom of personal judgment must be preserved. For democracy is inconceivable without laws, without government, and without limitation on the liberty of action of every citizen."1 Another essential of democracy, for Alain and the Radical party, is universal (women included) and secret-ballot suffrage. Such an extensive private franchise 5 Wahl, op. cit., pp. 278, 279. * Politique, p. 10. 0 Ibid. 8 Alain notes his contempt for "les Importants" frequently in his writings. In Mars ou la Guerre Jugde (Paris, 1921, 1936) (hereafter cited MGJ), he says, p. 99: "I observe two kinds of men everywhere, important people and indifferent (carefree) people. The care- free individual is happy to be alive and shows in his face the expression of egalitarian friendship, with that nuance, especially today, that demands nothing and expects little. Such a man reassures me. But the man of consequence frightens me, protected as he is behind his frontiers." 82 Politique, p. 9. 8 Ibid. * Ibid.</page><page sequence="14">ALAIN AND FRENCH CLASSICAL RADICALISM 607 maximizes the number of people who might vote against the "abuses of power." Universal suffrage will not, however, lead to anything new: "its role is rather to reaffirm vigorously those old truths that Power is naturally inclined to forget." 65 As an electoral mechanism, even universal suffrage is not restricted to a democratic order. "The election of the Pope by universal suffrage did not make the Church democratic.... A tyrant can be elected by universal suffrage." 66 In addition, "a law is never (if it is a true law) a servitude imposed by the greatest number of the smallest number, but a servitude imposed equally on all, so that it is impossible for a true law to be very far removed from the general will." 67 To Alain, the crucial test for determining whether a particular regime is "democratic" is "not the origin of powers, but the continuous and effective control that the governed then exercise upon the governors." 68 Again, le Contrdleur: just as the Radical party considered that it was its function par excellence to be the party of governmental opposition, rarely the party in power. The party's intrinsic ethos dictated that it was more im- portant to control power than to seize it. The radical individual within the democratic order is the man who is un- reservedly committed to droit (law, right) and equality. The disparate individual is therefore irrevocably linked in his relations and his activities to the social group, and, as the "politics of nature" decrees, his liberty is inconceivable outside social con- fines. Once more Alain refers to the Comtean social philosophy: even though the in- dividual is the supreme political entity, he is and always has been an inescapable fact of society. "Comte has propounded a momentous idea, the physics of our sentiments and our thoughts: namely, that man is man only because there is a society of men, which is as natural and inevitable as the solar system." 69 The doctrinal fallacy, then, of some self-professed "individualists" is the assumption that freedom of belief and opinion also embodies a crass license to disobey political authority. Alain answers: I can testify that the contrary is true. As far as I can see, those who respect and approve [politi- cal authority] obey poorly. Why? Because they do not govern themselves - they are con- sequently very weak in opposing their own passions. For example, it is a commonplace that the soldier who accepts those in authority unquestioningly and as a matter of fact is also the one who most readily neglects small chores when the officer is away."7 VI Though natural and inevitable, society - "always blind and always powerful," produces war, slavery, and superstition. It is of the very essence of society to encour- age barbarism, while in the individual spirit "humanity finds itself again." Moral e' Ibid., p. 39. SIbid., p. 9. 6T HMP, p. 67. * Politique, p. 9. Alain showed remarkably little interest in questions concerning the origin and legitimacy of the state. He often noted his debt to Comte for having learned from him the insignificance of the subject, as in Hommage a Alain, loc. cit., p. 28: "Comte, a man ahead of his time, saw that questions about the origin and legitimacy of 'powers' are meta- physical and that the positive function of the citizen is rather to watch and limit 'powers,' whatever they are."

And, for "society" read state?71 Alain concludes that the most notable attribute of the democratic spirit is that it is antisocial (antistatist) . To the true democrat, "society is a gross animal," a "Leviathan" of which individuals are but submissive units; it is uncivilized, an "infant," a "savage." 72 Society, as he reifies it, cannot differentiate between right and force. It becomes readily entangled in war, which is "compatible with justice and humanity in no sense whatever." 73 If on one decisive issue Alain is at all well known to the British and the Americans, that issue is his inordinate abhorrence of war. It all started with the Dreyfus Affair at the close of the nineteenth century. Emile Chartier, teaching at the Lyc~e de Lorient at the time, was soon to adopt the pseudonym Alain in signing his first propos for the Depeche de Lorient. He pro- claimed himself a Dreyfusard, an unflinching opponent of all forms of war, mili- tarism, and human oppression. It was obvious to Alain that Dreyfus was an inno- cent Jewish artillery officer who was being sacrificed in the dishonest name of "national security" to save the French Army from embarrassment and to bolster a reactionary elite that would use the Republic to achieve its own selfish designs. David Thomson, incorrectly it would seem, gives equal weight to both sides of the controversy: 7 Some of the many issues involved in the Dreyfus affair were the issues between the claims of individualism and personal rights and the claims of authoritarianism and "national security." Largely as a result of the affair, Radicalism came to be stated in the extreme and anarchistic75 form of the philosophy of "Alain," whilst authoritarianism was stated in an equally extreme form: the traditionalist itatisme of the Action FranGaise and the postwar semi-Fascist move- ments. In any event, Alain's decision to ally himself with the "Dreyfusards" was immediate and final; he never altered his initial verdict in the matter. And from that bleak period on, the unfortunate Dreyfus was a constantly recurring theme in his political writings. The man and the event made bitterly clear all the reasons why the Army, the Church, and the State must be opposed - why war, the unavoidable objective of militarism, must be prevented by all peaceable means. Alain's opposition to war, which "always" massacres the nation's best, was almost obsessively intractable. Nevertheless, he enlisted as a "simple soldier" in World War I, when there was no obligation whatever for him to do so; he was already forty-six years old. Yet he felt that he must personally endure the experience of war in order to earn the right to judge it. Throughout his life, his beliefs remained those of a fervently unshakable pacifist. War puts the Republic in danger of becom- ing tyrannical by abetting an expansion of executive and military power. "To believe 71 Alain's distinction between society and state is rather unclear; wherever he seems to use the terms synonomously is parenthetically indicated. 72 Politique, pp. 28, 29. 3 MGJ, p. 33. 4 Democracy in France: The Third and Fourth Republics (London: Oxford U. Press, 1958), p. 117. 7 To label Alain's political thought as "anarchistic" is totally to misread and misconstrue that thought. That Alain was in no meaningful sense an anarchist is a major sub-thesis of this paper.</page><page sequence="16">ALAIN AND FRENCH CLASSICAL RADICALISM 609 in war aggravates the risk." 76 And "every measure of force, even for preventing war, is a menace to peace." 77 These judgments Alain continually reaffirmed, as when he shared with Lang6vin and Rivet the leadership of the Vigilance Committee of Anti- Fascist Intellectuals in 1934, supported L6on Blum's Popular Front in 1936, and unremittingly refused to participate in the "crusade" or "holy war" against Hitler.78 While never an active participant, he remained in spirit and in his writings an adherent of the Vigilance Committee long after the resignation, for reasons of ex- pediency, of its Communist membership. (In fact, firmest resistance to both com- munism and fascism seemed to him to be concentrated in the poorer provinces towards which he was most favorably disposed.) Alain's conviction was not so much that war was to be dreaded more than fascism as it was that fascism, in both its Ger- man and Italian models, could be eventually defeated by delaying tactics and rea- sonable measures short of armed conflict. Alain's beliefs (personal reflections) con- cerning war are most poignantly, though not exclusively, revealed in Mars ou la Guerre Jugee, the only one of his works in an English translation. A fervid declara- tion of the rightness of non-violence, it is sui generis and deserves serious perusal even today. Beginning with an analysis of patriotic sentiments in wartime, Alain finds that while love of one's own country is natural enough, such love alone is not sufficiently strong to support a massive war effort. Other factors must be present and propitious if war is to be portrayed as a tenable enterprise for its participants. For Alain deems it to be ironically true that citizens are more willing to give their lives for their coun- try than to part with their money. Are wars then fought principally for economic gain? Though recognizing that some persons do indeed profit financially, he does not consider the economic motive primary. A spirit of individual courage and honor must somehow be engendered. Are hate and anger significant driving forces? Hate in war, which is collective hate, is somehow not only to be expected but is fully accepted by society. Human nature is so constructed that it endures a great mis- fortune like war more stoically than it endures a small one; for since war is waged and suffered collectively, the problem of individual responsibility either is minimized or does not arise at all. Observance of duty to one's country, in war duty to the military specifically, eliminates irresolution, to Alain (as to Descartes earlier) the "greatest of human evils." But the individual has not thereby obviated his personal irresoluteness; he is now merely acting in obedience to the fiat of the great Leviathan - society and the state. "If I obey voluntarily, I am no longer a slave." 79 Pacifists, however, cannot obey voluntarily in war. When a society (state) in the aftermath of war makes promises by negotiating treaties, it premises the terms of the agreements with the international law proviso, rebus sic stantibus. That is, it rarely assumes that it is ultimately bound by its word. If war is "politics exasperated," politics is but the continuation of war by non- 7 Raymond Aron, "Alain et la Politique," Homage a Alain, loc. cit., p. 164. 77 Ibid., p. 158. 78 CEFH, p. 311. 79 MGJ, p. 47.</page><page sequence="17">610 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY bellicose means.80 "Statesmen" illumined by that impersonal (albeit personified) Leviathan irresistibly adopt, or adapt themselves to, its conscienceless maxims. Its immorality becomes their immorality. If "statesmen" are politically and otherwise successful, it is by the criterion of success alone that they are presumed to be non- accountable for their behavior. Yet they must not be absolved of their guilt, Alain insists, even though society in its corporate capacity must be primarily blamed for the initial and greater malfeasance. VII In his defense of democracy, conceived as the only effective weapon against society (state), Alain contends that "every democratic movement is directed against the reactionism of that great animal, and tends to balance the social organism by a kind of contract incorrectly called the social contract because it is, in reality, the antisocial contract." 8s Adumbrating a more generic definition of democracy or, to be more exact, stating what democracy generically is not, Alain says: Democracy is not the rule of numbers; it is the rule of law. It is advisable to reflect upon this formula at this moment in our history... because all the proportionalists seem to me to have an entirely different conception of the Republic. According to them, it is enough merely that power be given to the numerically strongest, [since] for them justice demands nothing more.82 Decidedly different was Alain's conception of "the Republic." A democracy is not a legitimized tyranny of the majority, since "force of numbers can never create the barest foundation of right." s3 The majority is not necessarily just in what it thinks and does. The numerically strongest party or coalition might convince itself that it has a right to be unjust, or that, because it is the numerically strongest party or coalition, its beliefs and actions are ipso facto just. Stressing the fact that right and majority will are not automatically conjoined, Alain first defines right (droit) as the equal access to rights; e.g., it would be an infringement of the right of a dozen religious dissenters in a state if the majority should attempt to impose its own religion upon them. The protection of the minority, even the minority of one dissenting individual, is thus indispensable to a truly just democratic order. As a corollary of this conviction, Alain was convinced that he must favor the electoral system scrutin uninominal d'arrondissement over scrutin de liste, the latter advocated by the proportional representationists (or "proportionalists") .84 Because no really significant political improvements in society are possible anyway, the vigi- lant democrat (radical) must attempt only to prevent government from getting worse. Alain's political skepticism is clearly evident in his statement: "Many people say that the important thing is to advance; I believe that the important thing is not to slide backwards." 85 Scrutin uninominal d'arrondissement was simply a way to so Compare as definitional statement, but contrast in personal sentiment, related pronounce- ments of Treitschke and Clausewitz. 81 Politique, p. 30.

By contrast, proportional repre- sentation in the Chamber of Deputies would make the general conduct of political affairs impossible ab initio. The inevitable multiplication of parties would favor certain leaders who, by an inexorable law of politics, would grasp for more and still more power. The control of the arrondissement voters over their deputy would consequently be reduced. Furthermore, the elected deputies would find it imperative to expend so much time and energy fighting among themselves that the general will or even its modest approximation could hardly be realized. And by the default of impotent ministers, the power of the administrative bureaucracy would rapidly increase. According to Alain, the central mistake of the proportionalists was the suspicious assumption that the deputy of the single-member district is concerned only with the purely local interests of the people who have voted for him. In reality, in order to act as their delegate to protect their interests, he must also act as a repre- sentative of the nation, constantly compromising and conciliating among other deputies similarly elected and thus similarly circumstanced. To the rationally persua- sive argument of the proportionalists that proportional representation and scrutin de liste would more precisely mirror the variegated shades of the French political com- plexion than any alternative electoral system, Alain counters that the precision of the mandate given the deputy is much less essential to democracy than the immediate and continual contact of the deputies with the voters. Alain wanted to vote for a man, not for a party label. Moreover, it is overly facile, he states, to believe that representatives in a democ- racy are selected uniquely through the operation of the suffrage, "the sovereign's brief moment." 86 That "society with its representatives is as much a product of [human] nature as are plants and animals" 87 must never be "forgotten." As Montes- quieu had pointed out, the complex structure of society, the interaction of its needs, wants, passions, customs, history, geography, economic resources, climate, religion, language, and a plethora of other considerations, must be understood. The weight and the interplay of all these factors are reflected in public opinion, that synchroniza- tion of an aggregate of "opinions dependent upon opinions." Against unquestioning credulity, "man has invented the free circulation of opinions, which universal suf- frage represents symbolically." "8 But because an individual may be too strongly in- fluenced by what he thinks is public opinion, "it is useful for every person to decide for himself privately what is his own opinion before learning that of his neighbor." 89 Once more, the specter of Rousseau intrudes.90 Such insulated personal decision- * Politique, pp. 227, 228. 8 Ibid., pp. 35, 36. * Ibid., p. 37.

" Compare Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract in Ernest Barker, Social Contract (London: Oxford U. Press, 1953), p. 275: "If the People, engaged in deliberation, were adequately informed, and if no means existed by which the citizens could communicate one with another, from the great number of small differences the general will would result, and the decisions reached would always be good. But when intriguing groups and partial associations are formed to the disadvantage of the whole, then the will of each of such groups is general only in respect of its own members, but partial in respect of the State. When such a situation arises it may be said that there are no longer as many votes as men, but only as many votes as there are groups."</page><page sequence="19">612 THE WESTERN POLITICAL QUARTERLY making is manifestly impossible, however, and an informed public opinion as ordi- narily understood is the only remedy for naive public credulity. The suffrage provides an outlet for the expression of that opinion "against the abuses of power." Yet does the utilization of the suffrage confer power on "the people?" No. "To say that the people have power in a democratic regime is soft-thinking, [for] decep- tions follows." "9 Rather, the people exercise a control (ideally) over the pre-existing powers, over a long-prevailing governmental structure. The people can merely "modify a pre-existing order"; they cannot "create a new order." 92 Historically, society has developed (without fundamentally changing) more by a gradual accre- tion of customs, mores, usages, sentiments, and attitudes than by abrupt, ad hoc formulations of rationalistic constitutions, codified laws, and mechanically contrived political systems. "Custom is stronger than law; moreover, a true law is always ex- tracted from custom and necessity, almost by blind experience, as jurisprudence proves." 93 Acknowledgment and application of this principle of social, political, and legal growth Alain finds to be one of the many commendable features of British constitutionalism. VIII In every age and in every country, each person ideally merits a share in govern- ing to the extent of the contribution of his individual force. One may be Machia- velli's "lion" and thus stronger and more agile; another may be Machiavelli's "fox" and thus more guileful, cunning, and intelligent. Accordingly, Alain favors that the distribution of force be ascertained in terms of individual functional abilities. Some people are capable of conducting war, others of making policy, others of managing finances, others of judging and persuading, and still others of playing less auspicious and more menial community roles. Justice decrees that each must have his place, and order is the societal harmony that results from a proper division of labor. In delineating that division of labor, Alain employs the terms proletariat and bourgeoisie.94 However, he disavows the Marxian classification according to owner- ship or non-ownership of capital and private property."9 The extent of an individual's property holdings and other financial resources is thus not necessarily correlated with his socio-economic class. The true proletariat consists of those who act and do, pri- marily artisans, laborers who work with their hands and with simple machines and tools. They are basically irreligious. Into this category the peasant also falls, but the proletarian character of peasants is modified by the fact that many of them have remained superstitious and have retained an awesome feeling of dependence on the 91 Politique, p. 37. 2 Ibid., p. 39. 3 Politique, p. 271.

The bourgeoisie, by contrast, consists of those who persuade; and politicians, those never desisting persuaders, are always of the bour- geois class. Now, Alain admits that there is no such simplistically exact division in any society. Some people, for instance surgeons, who are both doers and persuaders, fit into both classes. In varying degrees, in fact, all people combine in their occupa- tions proletarian and bourgeois elements. A person's perception of his social status, moreover, may be as much a determinant of his class as the nature of the community tasks he performs. Alain's refusal to accept Marx's definitions and his consequent formulation of his own classifications show clearly how he could consistently enter- tain a prejudice in favor of workers and peasants and still defend and exalt the ownership of private property. Although a radical, Alain never accepted the tenets of socialism or communism, which he condemned as debasing to human freedom, dignity, and personality. He considered socialists without exception to be "stupid" and socialist ideas "a little too simple for my taste." 96 Whereas Alain's radicalism posited only one justice, one humanity, one human nature whose politics "has not, and will only slightly change," 97 socialists are fundamentally "historians," who see one society, one law, one machine, one justice inevitably replacing another. "All socialism kills the spirit with dogma." 98 When the Radical party joined the Socialists to form coalition governments, it did so only for the purpose of presenting a united front against the far Right, despised by Radicals and Socialists alike. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Radicals of Alain's persuasion, however, never concurred in socialist prescriptions for govern- mental control of the means of production, or for accelerated technological advance, or for a really equitable leveling of propertied interests.99 The socialist program would necessitate even more inhibiting governmental power exercised by an inflexibly centralized administration in Paris. Technological advance could only bring an increased need for scientific specialists in government and thus would further strengthen an already too powerful and officious bureaucracy. Rigid organization of doctrine and people was a socialist tactic that Alain could not approve. Besides, the long-range objective of socialism seemed impossible to achieve. Where the socialist experiment had been tried, the result was that society "was not governed according to the ideas of the workers, but according to the ideas of the administrators instead." 100 Alain's radicalism, and hence French radicalism generally during the Third Republic, was actually extreme liberalism in its political and religious connotations only. To an American the word radical may suggest social and economic, as well as political, extremes. To the French, not necessarily. Politically and religiously liberal, Alain's social and economic views must be adjudged uncompromisingly conservative - in the economic, individualistic, laissez-faire meaning of the term. He allied him- * Ibid., p. 11. * Ibid., p. 233. s Ibid., p. 253. m A more efficient distribution of France's gross national product was about the only policy that Alain's philosophy would sanction in the sphere of economic and social reform.

That he could foresee only the humanly deleterious possibilities of industrialization, urbanization, bureaucratic regimen, automation, technocracy, polemical advertising, destructive nuclear devices, and space-probing ventures (all non-radical) is obvious. In 1921 he claimed to be the only radical still alive - radi- cal, that is, in the Combist, pre-Gaullist, negative sense of one who is anti-Church, anti-State, anti-Army, anti-Power, anti-Psychology,101 and anti-Relativity,'02 but yet who had a positive love of right, equality, humanity, and justice as he understood those concepts. In an incomparable Gallic ambiance at the Lycee Henri-Quatre in Paris and at his small cottage in Le V6sinet, Alain taught and wrote prodigiously to help edu- cate two generations of Frenchmen and to provide an intelligible political ideology for the whole nation. Whether that ideology was truly constructive and liberating for the individual, or merely paralyzing and demoralizing for the government, de- pends in considerable measure on the political commitment and the reasoned judg- ment of the critic who evaluates it. What may be stated positively, however, is that more than anyone else in his lifetime, this unassuming philosopher impressed upon his countrymen the mood and spirit of French radicalism, which in many respects remains the mood and spirit of France today. Andre Maurois has concluded that Alain's "politics was modest, prudent, and invincibly resolute. .... No adversary could hold fast before him, [a man] who wished for nothing. A simple soldier in the army of citizens." 103 And perhaps it will be possible, some time, some place, to have efficient, workable government while "building each day," in the hallowed name of liberty, "a little barricade against the insensible Leviathan." 104 101 See Alain, "Des Caracteres," Propos (Pl6iades edition; Paris, 1956), pp. 557, 558. He was especially depreciative of Freud's dream and sex theories. As B6nez6, op. cit., p. 226, has suggested: "The Phenomenology of Husserl would perhaps be the modern doctrine closest to the idealism of Alain, as attested by transcendental thought and the rejection of all psy- chology, and perhaps the immediate knowledge of essences." 02 Deciding that theories of relativity and of "time as the fourth dimension" were "absurd" and contrary to common sense (probably because non-Euclidean and non-Cartesian), Alain accused Einstein of being an "intemperate geometrician," Alain, "Le G6ometre Intem- perant," Propos, loc. cit. fn. 101 supra, pp. 350, 351. 103 Andre Maurois, "La Politique dans l'Oeuvre d'Alain," Revue Politique et Parle'mentaire, 724 (June 1962), 22. 104 Alain, "Il Est Naturel ?
