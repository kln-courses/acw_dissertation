<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSTANTIN REGAMEY The Meaning and Significance of Spirituality in Europe and in India* I I WILL NOT CONCEAL that the task of exposing and discuss- ing at this conference the main trends and characteristics of Western, and particularly European, spirituality inspires me with some apprehension. I am an Orientalist, and when acting as a spokesman for Western doctrines I can do it rather as a European, whose mentality and culture have been shaped by the traditions of his continent, than as representative of any particular Western philosophical school. I hope that professional philosophers will ex- cuse some deficiencies of my erudition and consider me, rather, as a product of a cultural tradition than as one of its active animators. This position may give me greater freedom in embracing as a whole innumerable currents of European life and thought, as they are reflected in the mind of an average representative of its culture-and perhaps it will also give me greater cour- age in dealing with doctrines and problems which Western technicians of philosophy seem to avoid as not sufficiently scientific and up to date. In fact, when reading the proceedings of the former conferences held at this same place, one is struck by the obvious disparity of approach in Western and Eastern papers. While Eastern authors defend with deep and sincere conviction even the extreme spiritual attitudes of their philosophies and re- ligions and do not hesitate to appeal to the authorities of their whole history, most of their Western colleagues seem to confine themselves to some modern technically scientific analysis and, when referring from time to time to great metaphysical or religious traditions of the West, do it with utmost discretion, * This article was presented to the Third East-West Philosophers' Conference, held at the University of Hawaii in 1959, and is to be published in Philosophy and Culture-East and West, the Report of that conference. It is published here at the request of a number of people because of its unusual interest in relation to current misunderstandings of the matter under discussion. The style here conforms to that of the conference paper.

This fact has not been overlooked by the participants of the former con- ference, as pointed out by Mr. Moore in a note to the "Seminar Reports"1: "Emphasis was placed upon Western naturalism for strategic reasons, be- cause it was felt that in the contrast of this doctrine and several Oriental sys- tems lay the basic cleavage between East and West. . . . There was no need to reconcile the 'idealisms' of East and West, since their affinities have been abundantly demonstrated by scholars on both sides. . . . There was no intent to regard Western naturalism as the present-day philosophy of the West, nor were Christian and Western idealistic ethics neglected in the Semi- nar discussions." In spite of this final remark, it is a fact that the West has been represented at these discussions rather one-sidedly. For an attempt at world philosophical synthesis such a strategic experiment was somewhat mis- leading. There are really few possibilities of finding a common language be- tween Western naturalism and, e.g., the general trends of Indian thought. Although "recent Western naturalism . . . in its present development does not wish to exclude any actually experienced value or insight,"2 and conse- quently may accept as real facts the spiritual experiences of Eastern religions and philosophies, yet it would consider them rather as new data for psycho- logical or psychoanalytical research or, at most, as the extending of the no- tion of experience to that of dreamless sleep or of trance more or less pro- voked by appropriate techniques of concentration. But this way of viewing the facts can neither justify the exceptional value attached to these experi- ences in the East nor explain why they are considered as man's unique access to the ultimate reality, as the irrefutable proof of the existence of a spiritual reality with regard to which all other evidence is secondary or sim- ply illusory. The reaction of our Eastern colleagues was unanimous: they refused to examine the higher insight of the ultimate at the same level as sensorial, psychological, or purely empirical evidence." On the other side, naturalism can admit the evidence of infra-psychic or para-psychic phe- nomena; it cannot recognize in them spiritual facts, that is, facts in our life which cannot be explained by purely physical or psychological causes and which, therefore, are considered as more or less direct proofs of the existence of a higher, non-scientifically controllable principle or power. 1Charles A.

Cf. the violent condemnation of such methods by Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramana Maharshi.</page><page sequence="3">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 107 Now, the attitude which admits such a higher sphere of reality without which most facts of human life would remain unexplained is by no means the monopoly of the East. In spite of violent criticism of some modern schools of Western philosophy against th.? "romantic vagaries of ideal- ism" or of "meaningless metaphysical judgments," an objective and impar- tial glance at the whole history of Western thought and culture will reveal, not only that the spiritual attitude was prevalent until the middle of the nineteenth century, but also that it is by no means absent or secondary in our times. The most representative philosophical schools of present-day Europe -neo-idealism, phenomenology, existentialism, French spiritualism, person- alism, and, last but not least, different varieties of modern "schools of meta- physics" (Alexander, Whitehead, Nicolai Hartmann, Neo-Thomism)-are all much nearer the spiritual attitude than the scientificism or different kinds of positivism. And, what is more important, this attitude is not limited to academic discussions of philosophers, but continues to mold the mentality of millions of Westerners, to inspire and guide their activity, to stimulate them to creative or heroic deeds, to self-sacrifice for the sake of ideals which by no means could be identified with the materialistic greed of personal or social welfare. Yet, if Westerners themselves do not find it necessary to emphasize this side of their life and culture, we cannot be astonished that even the most open-minded among our Eastern friends have such a narrow conception of the dominant trends of Western mentality. If it were not our own fault, would it be possible that, e.g., Mr. Raju would affirm that "Western philoso- phers might find it useful to understand man . . . as a spiritual being far transcending his relations to matter and society,"' as if it were not only one of the basic beliefs of Christian religion but also one of the fundamental problems of present-day European philosophy. Similarly, the conviction that "higher and higher forms of being rule the lower and lower ones"5 has been since the Greek philosophers the main source of the whole of European spiritualism. It seems, therefore, that we can achieve a more fruitful work when com- paring Eastern doctrines with Western spiritual conceptions and not with Western systems which in their methodology find no place for the idea of the spiritual. This comparison is not at all superfluous. The affinities of idealisms of East and West which "have been abundantly demonstrated by scholars on both sides" are mostly concerned with single points, and their similitudes appear often to be quite superficial when considered in a broader 4EEWIP, p. 227. SIbid., p. 229.</page><page sequence="4">108 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY context. As a whole, these "idealisms" do need to be reconciled, if we want to avoid misunderstandings, since the fundamental differences between them are more important than convergencies. And before we try to reconcile these two attitudes--or at least to make them mutually transparent-we ought to clarify the basic differences. Moreover, Western spirituality is by no means limited to idealisms or even to Christianity. Both in theoretical and practical fields, it finds expressions which are for us highly spiritual but often appear to Easterners as self-sufficient humanism or as sterile, purely academic, or dogmatic speculations. My intent is neither to defend Western spirituality (which, after all, is much more attacked in the West than in the East) nor to examine which of them-that of the East or that of the West--deserves in a higher degree the qualification of spiritual. It has often been stated at former conferences that it is dangerous to oppose East and West en bloc and to forget how numerous and far-reaching are the divergencies within each of these areas. It would be a hopeless task to try to give even an approximate description of the extremely multifarious expressions of the spiritual attitude in Western thought and culture, all the more since even the perspectives in which the historic development of this attitude can be viewed are also very divergent and never quite objective. I shall merely try to emphasize some basic tenden- cies which have given Western culture and mentality its particular style and which in most obvious ways differ from the Eastern approach to the spir- itual. Here, too, I shall take into consideration, above all, the most repre- sentative aspects of Eastern spirituality: those of Hinduism, of Mahaydna Buddhism, and occasionally of Taoism.' II A thorough examination of some constant reproaches made to the West by the Easterners leads often to paradoxical results. Thus Mr. Moore twenty years ago very judiciously showed' that the alleged hedonism, considered as a typical Western attitude, is much more characteristic of the East where 6 Neo-Confucianism, with its concepts of determinate ii (organic principle) accessible to reason, with its method of ko chih, which is rational intuition without a "leap," and with its emphasis upon action, is much nearer to Western patterns than to Buddhism or Taoism. As for Islam, I fully agree with the well-known thesis of Northrop (The Taming of the Nations [New York: The Macmillan Co., 1952), chaps. V, VI) that with regard to its spiritual founda- tions it belongs much more to the West than to the East. 7 Charles A. Moore, ed., Philosophy--East and West (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1944), pp. 309-311.</page><page sequence="5">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 109 even the highest spiritual aspirations are less disinterested than in the West.8 More consistent is the reproach of the scientificism of Western culture, though it is often improperly confounded with materialism and mechanical- ism; there remains almost nothing of the naive conception of matter in mod- ern science and pure mechanicalism is also abandoned by present-day physics. What remains is the method of studying reality by means of exact con- ceptual reasoning based on experience and tested by experiment. Now, this method cannot be a motive of reproach, since in India it is applied even to spiritual facts; even the intuition of the ultimate requires experimental test- ing. As Swami Nikhilananda says, "Untested philosophical beliefs are no more trustworthy than untested scientific hypotheses." And on the same page he says: "through Yoga it can be demonstrated that genuine religious ex- periences are as valid as scientific truths." We find here the same postulate of empiric testing as in Western science, the only distinction being that this method is applied to a non-material subject and consequently cannot be ex- pressed in exact relational formulas or explicitly described. But we find even there our postulate of interpreting raw experience and controlling it in order to avoid delusion: "personal experience may very well be self-decep- tion"9 and must be tested by scriptural evidence and severe reasoning. Reasoning is here only auxiliary, a method which prepares the proper ex- perience and controls it. On the contrary, the West alone has discovered in reason the source of knowledge which needs no external testing at all, since every experience is automatically interpreted by and consequently dependent on our intelligence. This evaluation of reason as the final instance of knowl- edge is one of the pillars of Western spirituality: the feeling of certainty and universality of rational truth, which cannot be deduced from experimental data, presupposes, if not necessarily a higher intellect modeling our con- sciousness, at least the existence in ourselves of a universally valid mental faculty irreducible to sensorial perceptions. This distinction in the hierarchy of our highest sources of truthful knowl- edge brings us back to the famous opposition, established by Mr. Northrop, of "theoretically formulated and indirectly tested concepts by postulation" 8 Although the Indian, and especially the Buddhist, spiritual way requires a fully disinterested attitude of self-denial and self-sacrifice, it has to be practiced for the sake of one's own moksa. Indian ethics is pre-eminently soteriological, whereas the ideal of the good as an imperative, as a moral duty independent of reward or other advantages, has been developed in the West. Professor Mahadevan points out in his paper, "Indian Ethics and Social Practice," in this volume, that this concept of the ought-to-be-done (kdryata-jiifna) has been sponsored by the Prabh-kara Mimarihsakas. But this was a school that had no influence on the general aspect of Indian thought, and-as Mahadevan admits (ibid., p. 5)-"most of the systems of Indian philosophy would agree with the Nyaya in holding the view of ethics as instrumental to the desired end." 9 EE WP, p. 234.</page><page sequence="6">110 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY in the West and "directly tested concepts by intuition" in the East. In the perspective of Western spirituality, especially important are concepts by postulation and rational relations, which do not need any experimental veri- fication and can be tested only by reason itself. Though absolute confidence in such omnipotence of abstract rational truth is not and has not been shared by all Western currents of thought, it remains one of the most original and distinctive features which have shaped Western mentality. It can be opposed both to Western experimentally scientific method and to the general Indian attitude. In fact, in India, this Western rational approach is considered as an antith- esis of the spiritual. It is from that point of view that Radhakrishnan op- poses Eastern Religion to Western Thought and reproaches the West with having conceptualized in abstract formulas life, mind, man, society, and spirit. We know that a strong reaction against this one-sided deification of reason has arisen also in the West and has led to a considerable extension of the notion of the spiritual. Nevertheless, this reaction has very rarely been accompanied by a radical disavowal of the spiritual origin and significance of reason. The Indian reaction is based on other arguments: Knowledge by concepts is knowledge about reality; it is mediacy, while Eastern and espe- cially Indian sages strive for immediacy, for direct identification with funda- mental reality. Now, the Western response to this argument (which, how- ever, is not shared by all Westerners) is that we, too, strive for immediacy, but we find it in a higher degree in reason than in experience. Let us quote the postulate of immediacy as it has been developed by Mr. Raju in the be- ginning of his paper presented at the former conference, "if self-sufficiency or self-validation is needed somewhere, if we are to get it in some cognition, then why not acknowledge it in every cognition? That is, the truth of every judgment must be self-revealing, and reality or existence must be self-reveal- ing. But what would be the nature of a reality that is self-revealing? It can- not be anything but Self."''o Then the Western response would be, "It can- not be anything but the Cartesian cogito," where the immediate statement of the fact of reasoning is primary to the deduction ergo sum." And the convic- tion of the existence of some reality being an "other" to knowledge is a fur- 10lbid., p. 211. 1' Indian philosophy knows a strikingly similar exordium in the beginning of Vasubandhu's Vihjatika, in which the author finds the proof of the reality of consciousness in the fact of doubting. The absoluteness and self-sufficiency of consciousness is here even much more em- phasized than in Descartes, since Vasubandhu does not infer from cogito either the sum or even the subjectivity of thinking. His formula is, rather: cogito ergo cogitatio est. Yet, the conviction of the superiority of undifferentiated immediacy is, even in this extreme Indian idealism, so powerful that, in spite of such rational premises, Vasubandhu, in his final conclusions, deprives the pure consciousness of any trace of conceptual or discursive thought.</page><page sequence="7">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 111 ther deduction, a postulate of reason which will avoid the solipsism of the consequent esse est percipi vel percipere. But our only faculty which not only is able to reveal itself but can correct its errors within itself and through transcendency can validate itself without appealing to external sources of knowledge-is reason. Why not consider it as reality? This step has been taken by Western thinkers, and it is of secondary im- portance whether they consider reason as being the exclusive reality (as post-Kantian idealists have done) or as the essential part of reality, the in- telligible, existing in things outside the mind, but yet in accordance with the laws of reason (as, since Greek philosophy, different schools of Western realism have done). The latter will add to this intelligible and rational es- sence the mysterious existence which, as already stated, is also a postulate of reason much more than a product of objective evidence, since it can be nei- ther verified experimentally nor felt outside the subject. What is really im- portant for the particular development of conceptual thought in the West is the fact that it discovered in reason the method of attaining universally valid certitude and that this sense of certitude gives the impression of grasping reality immediately'" and in its very essence. The sense of certitude produced in the discoverers of rational truths the same rapture and ecstasy that the intuition of Atman-Brahman gave to the sages of the Upanisads. And it is not surprising that ancient Greek philosophers, when discovering, in the mathe- matical rules empirically elaborated by the Egyptians, universally valid laws, independent of any sensorial and common-life experience, saw in this ra- tionality the presence in their minds and in Nature of some higher, spiritual principle. The process is the same in the West as in the East: the spiritual value is discovered inwardly and put in relation to the psychical faculty which affords certitude free from any contingency. We have no right to deny that Eastern and Western mystics do experience the sense of absolute certitude when they reach the direct insight of the ultimate. But this insight is indescribable and incommunicable, known only to him who has attained it. It is a charac- teristic feature of every, both worldly and trans-worldly, experience that it cannot be directly communicated unless it is rationally elaborated and in- terpreted. This is possible with worldly experience; the trans-worldly insight can at most be metaphorically or negatively alluded to: in its essence it re- mains ineffable. And this is the paradox of every mystic realization, that it leads to an immediate apprehension of an all-embracing universal unity in 12 Here, "immediately" does not mean "instantaneously." Rational truth very often requires a long chain of reasoning, but this chain is based on the same assurance of the validity of reasoning. Rational certitude is immediate to the extent that it requires no other tests than those contained in reason itself. It is precisely self-revealing and self-validating.</page><page sequence="8">112 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY which all individuality is absorbed and dissolved, and at the same time it is based on an absolutely individual experience. The West has always felt the same longing for an all-embracing unity, but it achieves it in the reason which permits unequivocal communication and does not dissolve the particular. It is the way of grasping the world as a whole without destroying it and with the possibility of sharing this uni- versal grasp with every other being endowed with reason. In the East, the ultimate unity is realized through elimination of every distinction; in the West, the distinctions are carefully emphasized, and the unity has to be achieved through their harmonization. In its search for unity, the East attains the One through negation of the individual and the personal, and yet realizes it in an exclusively individual mental operation; the West in its search for unity discovers the totality which maintains individual and personal distinc- tions and yet succeeds in securing universal union through the communicabil- ity of the truth and the generalizing power of reason. These basic distinctions will leave ineffaceable traces on the whole spiritual development of both West and East and will have important practical con- sequences. They will solidify the characteristic Western attitude which we may call "spiritual pluralism," and they are also at the basis of one of the most fundamental metaphysical divergencies between Europe and India: in the West, the generalizing reason is the principle of universality, and being is considered as principium individuationis (there are very few exceptions to this general attitude, e.g., Duns Scotus); in the East, being is considered as universal and undifferentiated, and all individualization is the product of ra- tional determinations. I know that the identification of Indian philosophy with intuition and of Western thought with reason is a commonplace and, like all such theses, is an oversimplified one. The opposition against the rationalization of reality has been and is still quite important in the West, where we have also purely intuitionistic currents, much more anti-intellectual than India has ever had. On the other hand, the dialectical and logical skill of Indian philosophy is well known. We can certainly agree with Mr. Datta when he concludes13 that reason is the common method of philosophy in India as it is in the West. But we can ask: On what level? In the West, reason rises to the highest regions of reality; it has been considered as the unique faculty which can lead not only to the threshold of the Absolute but to the Absolute itself. In India, it has to disappear at this threshold. No rational approach to Nirguna Brahman is possible; there is a gap which cannot be crossed by anything other than 13 EEIWP, pp. 87, 88. Cf. also the remarks of Raju, ibid., p. 440, note 3.</page><page sequence="9">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 113 supreme insight. The Mahdyanist praj~i seems to be nearer the concept of the absolute reason of Western idealists; it is the foundation of discursive reason (vijfdna), and in the relation vijidna-praj1*i we may find some anal- ogy with the hierarchy of reason in post-Kantian schools. Yet, in Western idealism this ascension is achieved through subsequent degrees of transcend- ency which include lower forms of reason and do not eliminate them. There appears a dialectic continuity, whereas between vijfzana and praj~a no transi- tion is possible. As in the case of Nirguna Brahman, "there is a leap, an existential leap."14 Here we touch the key problem of our discussion. The absence of continuity in the hierarchy of mental faculties as accepted by Indian and related doctrines affords the clearest explanation of the fundamental differences which separate the conceptions of the spiritual in India and in the West. In India, the limit between the spiritual and the non-spiritual is identified with the leap which has to be achieved when passing from reason to the direct insight of the ulti- mate. All that lies below that gap is non-spiritual, is material. According to Hindu psychology based on the Sarmikhya system, even cosmic reason (bud- dhi), as much as the ego (ahanzkara) and the mind (manas), "are not dif- ferent from external material objects, such as trees or stones, as far as their essential nature is concerned."'" All the variety of our psychical life that even Western naturalism does not reduce to physical processes is conceived in this psychology as effects of more or less subtle forms of matter. The only spirit- ual fact in a human being is his experience of the ultimate; the activities of " Cf. D. T. Suzuki, "Reason and Intuition in Buddhism," in EEWP, p. 43 (cf. also, above, note 11). In the same passage, Suzuki explains that there can be no continuous progress from vijRaina to prajii, because, if there were, "prajfd would cease to be praijfa; it would become another form of vijiana." This statement shows the difference between the Western and Indian notions of transcendency. Western thought has discovered in reason, and in reason alone, the capacity of transcending itself and analyzing itself. In India, the ancient denial of this capacity ("You cannot know that which is the knower of knowledge," Brhadsrarnyaka Upanisad II.iv.14) has always remained valid; if reason is transcended, it can be so only by a totally different principle. Hence the leap which creates problems unknown to the West: How can the ultimate be the foundation of rational developments if it is in full transcendency with regard to reason and to any determination? And, in the religious aspect, how can Brahman be the cause of the world, if it cannot be affected by any process of acting or transformation? Hence the doctrines of Tnaya and Jakti, which, though accepted by gaihkara, are considered by him as logically and ontologically inexplicable (cf. Raju, EEWP, p. 222). Here lies the source of the conception of vivarta (illusory transformation), which saves the transcendency of Brahman but at the cost of rendering the world illusory. The extremely illuminating paper of Paul Mus, "The Problematic of the Self, West and East, and the Mandala Pattern" in this volume, gives further precision to this fundamental problem of transcendency in Indian thought. In India, transcendency is a method of reaching a higher level through a non-additive integration," a kind of coalescence of lower elements into unity, which in itself represents no supplementary "entity" added to the total of the integrated elements; "It is all of them, without being any of them." The lower elements are not subordinated to the integrating unity, but identified with it. This unity is co-extensive with its parts, which are also co-extensive among them. "s Cf. Swami Nikhilananda, EEWP, p. 102.</page><page sequence="10">114 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY man can be considered as spiritual only when they are directed toward the realization of atman.l" This Indian conception does not disqualify psychical life in such a degree as would appear to us in the West. But, when discussing the problems of spiritual values, it is necessary to be aware of the much narrower meaning of the word "spiritual" in India. There is some terminological misuse in the translation of "atman" by "spirit." This equivalence would be fairly correct, if we take into consideration the original, mythological meaning of these terms when both tmran and 1rrv6/4a - spiritus denoted "breath." In their further development, both terms have assumed such divergent meanings that the translation of "adhyatma" by the word "spiritual" is today rather misleading. The Western term is here mechanically applied to a notion already codified and having in the East a long tradition. In the West, the connotations of this term are far more complex, since, from the beginning, the notion of spirit has not been limited to a single peculiar psychical power and it has been con- siderably enlarged during the history of Western spirituality. III Let us sum up briefly the history of the origin of Western spirituality in those two cradles of Western civilization that are the Graeco-Roman world and the Hebrew-Christian religion. The basic motive for the distinction of two spheres of reality, matter and spirit, has been everywhere the same: the more or less intuitively felt essential irreducibility of some facts of our life either to physical or sensorial processes or to the merely physiological needs of food, shelter, procreation, pleasure, etc. Disinterested moral feelings, de- mands for order, responsibility, freedom, justice, longing for immortality or unity with the whole, intuitions of beauty or of truth, mental faculties such as attention, abstraction, coherent reasoning, and quite generally the notion of non-utilitarian values-these were facts which distinguished man from the animals and required at least a radical distinction between physical and psychical components of human personality. Yet, the profound feeling of dis- proportion between the imperative attraction of these aspirations, which often induced men to act against their instincts or egoistic needs, and the limitations and contingency even of our psychical life, led to the assumption 16 In the discussion of my paper, Raju objected that there is no radical discrimination be- tween buddhi and atman, buddhi being the principle nearest the ultimate. I answer in Raju's words ("The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought," Philosophy East and West, IV, No. 3, October, 1954), in which it is definitely stated that buddhi, compared with X6yos, is not the same as the Highest Spirit, that antahkarana, which, according to Sarhkhya and most of the Vedintic schools, encompasses reason, ego, and mind, "is not the same as spirit." "Spirit is beyond the principle of reason."</page><page sequence="11">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 115 of some higher source of these intuitions and demands. The ancient religions, with their mythological, cosmogonic, ritualistic, or magical schemes, could but partly justify these aspirations and explain these intuitions. In nearly all the great civilizations of the ancient world they were completed or sublimated by the discovery of principles, laws, or entities--often placed above the gods or even substituted for traditional pantheons-which appeared as models or norms for human conduct and as the supreme goal of man's aspirations. I say "discovery," since they had to be found as explanations of our higher faculties and demands. The latter being considered as reflections or projections of the Supreme Entity or Norm, our only way leading to this supernatural principle was to scrutinize in our psychical data those which gave the feeling of great- est certainty and universality. The East, and especially India, found this feeling in the mystical experience of immediacy. The "leap" that this experience required marked the sharp limit between higher and lower components of human nature and, per ana- logiam, between the ultimate and the relative in the ontological perspective. The way of the Greeks was different. Their early half-cosmogonic, half- scientific conceptions of Nature have often been compared with Indian doc- trines: Parmenides with Upanisadic monism, Heraclitus with Buddhism. But the similarities here are rather external, since these pre-Socratic doctrines were no projections of internal experience into the ontological field, but speculatively elaborated constructions. For these philosophers man was an object of inquiry only as a part of Nature, and they did not seek within him the principle which would explain the world. Consequently, they did not try to establish a definite limit between his lower and higher components, or to emphasize a particular faculty. They did it indirectly, however, through the discovery of a new kind of theoretically formulated conceptual knowledge. And when Pythagoras found out that universal validity lies not in the things but in pure relations, he did not hesitate to recognize in mathematical laws the ruling principle of the world. By the same token, and in spite of all mythological hypostases with which he enveloped his discovery, he opened the way to the conviction that among all human faculties reason alone can attain the universal norm. With Socrates, this faculty assumes the full value of a spiritual principle opposed to our physical and sensorial components. It is reason which forces us to act against our desires and instincts and in conformity with universal norms. It can dominate our body and give a real freedom of choice. It serves as the link between all men. But it is not an undifferentiated static element infused in every being which has to be discovered. "Know thyself" differs in both words from the Oriental "Self-realization": it does not mean the im-</page><page sequence="12">116 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY mediate insight into a supra-personal Self, but the gradual penetration through reflection into one's own self with all its psychical complexity and the transformation of this self into a more perfect individuality conforming itself to universally valid norms. These norms, again, are neither given from outside nor grasped in an act of instantaneous intuition. They are elaborated by the same reflection, in a free inquiry which may be achieved collectively in discussions. As Northrop has pointed out,"1 the Sophists had already shown that determinate knowledge given with immediacy varied from person to per- son. This discovery caused Socrates to return to the speculatively inferred, theoretically constructed, and mutually, from person to person, tested method of knowledge. Only then could one escape sophistry and find determinate laws the same for all men. The further ascension of reason in Greek philosophy is well known: its deified hypostasis as voi?s, its formulation as XMyoq, its principle of determi- nate coherence and universal order opposed to confusion, formlessness, and chaos of direct experience, and, finally, its magnificent apotheosis in the Platonic world of ideas. In spite of such exaltation of one single component of the human psyche, there appeared no gap between it and other mental faculties. Both our moral intuitions (the Good received the dignity of the supreme Idea) and even sensorial perceptions, spiritualized in the contempla- tion of Beauty, were included by Plato in his world of spiritual values. The mysterious capacity of art-that no naturalistic or utilitarian theory can ever explain or justify-to express spiritual values through concrete elements grasped by our senses was particularly emphasized in his doctrine. But all these elements are conceived as spiritual only because they express a rational perfection. With Aristotle, to whom humanity is indebted for the first precise formu- lation of the very functioning of conceptual reason, this reason is to a certain extent despiritualized: the rational no longer has its source in a higher prin- ciple, not even in our higher mental faculties, but in things; the intellect is supplanted by the intelligible. And, with the Stoics, the spiritual principles will become material: IIvEEiLa, which is the prototype of our term "spirit," is for them a material breath, and reason is identified with fire. And yet, with the same Stoics appears the first intuition of the spiritual significance of the person as the center of free accepted universal law and the ideals of freedom, justice, and equality of all men before the law. Through the practical applica- tions of these ideals in Roman legal science, the Western world will receive a set of principles which belong to its basic spiritual foundations. At the same time, the Graeco-Roman process of discovery of spiritual values seems to be 17 The Taming of the Nations, p. 206.</page><page sequence="13">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 117 closed and petrified. Having centered their inquiry exclusively on the con- ceptual power of reason, the philosophers of antiquity stopped before the deeper faculties of reason: they did not discover transcendency, and they dis- regarded the intuitions of the infinite, which troubled the magnificent but rigid rational construction. This rigidity will be overthrown by a new force appearing suddenly at their horizon: the message of Christianity. Coming from the East, Christianity brings with it new conceptions of the divine and spiritual. Yet, the genuinely Oriental elements of its message- the religion of the Old Testament-were not basically distinct from those infused in the minds of the Greeks and Romans by five centuries of philosoph- ical research: the unity of God and a moral law based on determinate prin- ciples and having, even more than in Stoicism, the character of a contract, a covenant between God and men. But in Christianity-which, as has been frequently pointed out,'8 is as Greek as it is Hebrew in its roots-the still tribal and natural, though divinely inspired, concept of law was transformed into the ideal of universal law, which met the Greek conception of man as "citizen of the universe." And this law was no longer based on the Com- mandments of God codifying in determinate moral statutes the natural social order, but it appealed to the Xoyogo, which is exalted in the famous climax of the opening words of the Fourth Gospel more than it had ever been in Greek philosophy: It is at the beginning of the whole, it is with God, it is God. This XAdyog is no undifferentiated all-embracing unity but an ideal, a theo- retically conceivable pattern, determining a law of absolutely universal valid- ity equal for all men, prior to the creation and infinitely superior to it.19 And it is at the same time a Person. The very conception of universal reason and law was familiar to the Graeco-Roman world. But the origin of this reason, the practical implications of the new law, and its "non-prudential" ethics were in many respects to appear to antiquity as overthrowing the established habits and shocking their common sense. The values of the determinate and the infinite were here turned upside-down. Christianity directed man toward the infinite, no longer presented as synonymous with disorder and confusion, but as the source of transcendent grace and as the supreme goal of man's aspirations. The link between the infinite and the finite is not reason but love of God for man and of man for God. It is no longer the Stoics' intellectual love of s1 Cf., among others, F. S. C. Northrop, The Taming of the Nations, p. 189. 19 Cf. Luke 16:16, 17: "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail," and Paul, Romans 17:12, 14: "The law is holy," "the law is spiritual." The universality of this law based on X6yor is also the pattern of every right reasoning; hence Jesus' condemnation of the vain and futile speculations of the scribes and Pharisees, which resembles so much the condemnation of sophistry by Socrates.</page><page sequence="14">118 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY God but a feeling that captured hearts directly, thanks to the event that was, as Kierkegaard will say, "folly for the Greeks, scandal for the Jews": the In- carnation. It is neither an avatara (incarnated being) nor a nirmanakaya (transformation-body), but total acceptance of man's fate, with its simplic- ity, its deficiencies, and its sufferings, and even martyrdom. The power of love testified by this supreme exaltation of man's nature by God, the central role that it will play not only in revolutionary Christian ethics but also in the very essence of the new religion, provided a new dimen- sion of the spiritual: it opened the path to the supernatural through emo- tional faculties and suddenly gave to this component of human psychical life a rank higher than that of reason. This new path is faith-the discovery in one's emotional life of a subjective certitude more powerful and evident than that given by reason-not an im- mediate experience of the ultimate which proceeds through gradual elimina- tion of sensorial, emotional, and cognitive processes, but confidence based on love to God, which engages and permeates all psychical faculties of man and which has as its object, not an undifferentiated and ineffable reality, but a set of revealed truths, determinable and describable though not spontaneously attainable through "natural" reasoning. This way of knowledge was so new for the philosophically trained minds of the Greeks and Romans that not only the revelation but also the very faculty of faith has been conceived as a supernatural gift of grace granted by God in his infinite love for creation. The fact that faith appeals to all mental faculties explains also the variety of approaches to God in Christianity. We find there the passive and almost exclusively emotional surrender to the Divine, and the tendency to rise to the mysteries of God through reason (since the scriptural authority did not ex- clude this possibility),20 and also the way of mystical approach much more frequent and important than is generally admitted in the Orient. All these ways are by no means exclusively Christian and can be found in other great religions. Especially in the mystical approach the similarities seem to be strik- ing throughout the world. Yet, though it is not easy to analyze and describe mystical experiences, it seems that there are some characteristic differences between Christian mysticism and that of Hinduism or Buddhism. The first is preceded by faith, is not its source; far from being an experience prepared by appropriate methods and training'2 and leading to an impersonalized bliss, in which all distinctions and relations disappear, Christian mysticism has, 20 Paul, Romans 1:19, 20: "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead 21 Yet, the methods and elaborated techniques of concentration are also known in Christian practice; the recent studies of the Byzantine hesychasm have shown striking similarities with yoga.</page><page sequence="15">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 119 rather, the character of contemplation guided by love and striving for com- munion with the Divine in the perspective of "me" and "Thou." In India, we find this form of mystical approach with Caitanya, Ramakrishna, and Auro- bindo, rather than with the ancient sages of the Upanisads or with the con- sequent Advaitins. And, as for spirituality based on love of God, the quasi- identity between the Indian religions of bhakti (devotion) and the Christian approach is recognized even by the most exclusive Christian theologians.22 The difference lies in only two essential points: in the personal though in- finite nature of God and in the status of man, who is created by God but is neither part nor attribute of him.23 Christianity takes over the Old Testament concept of man as created as a being distinct from God but in his image, which means that man is en- dowed with moral principles and personal responsibility in the temporal world. But it adds more: the grace of the Holy Spirit, giving man the possi- bility of achieving his eternal destiny. Since then the expression "spiritual nature of man" is no longer a metaphor. The Holy Spirit working in man is not the presence of an ontological all-embracing principle that it is sufficient to discover in the innermost region of one's being, but the inspiration of the divine X6yog, infinite virtuality of creative activity that man not only can but must develop through all his faculties. In contrast to Indian religions, which, in one way or another, consider the cultivation of individual personality as a hindrance in the path of spiritual progress, Christianity bestows on man's person a dignity and a value that it never had before. Man is no longer an instance of universal law, but a unique value in itself, a creature which re- ceived from God its being but also the potentiality to create by itself, freely, its own spiritual person.24 And the community of men united in the EKKXrqO-'a, 22 Cf., e.g., F. Pierre Johanns, S. J., La pensde religieuse de l'Inde, (Paris: Bibliotheque de la Facult6 de philosophie et de lettres de Namur, 1952). 23 God as person is known to the bhakti religions, but he is in final conclusions conceived still as a kind of manifestation, a secondary nature, of the ultimate. In spite of the Indian anti- dogmatic attitude, there exist in India, as well as in the West, some constant patterns, which cannot be completely rejected or explained away. To such dogmas belongs the deep conviction that man and the universe are not outside God but within him. In spite of various efforts dis- played by Riminuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, etc., in order to reconcile the personal relation be- tween God and man with the dogma of srsti (creation), the latter could never be ignored in the Indian tradition. This point remains one of the paramount divergencies between the Indian and the Western religious outlooks. The authority on both sides is the scriptural evidence. But in this respect, too, there are characteristic differences between India and the West. In Hinduism scriptural evidence represents the sum of the experiences of ancient sages, as much as of modern inspired men; it is a kind of collective spiritual patrimony. In Christianity it is considered as revelation, supreme and final truth given to the finite man directly by God. Hence its more rigid and exclusive character. 24 Person is not an equivalent of individual; it is an ideal of spiritual fulfillment that man has to achieve. This is "self-realization" in the Christian sense. The very presence of this ideal in our mind is considered as a proof of the existence of the prototype of person in God. To</page><page sequence="16">120 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY the mystical Body of Christ, is called to fulfill, in the temporal sphere, God's designs. Creation is not a once-achieved static fact; it goes on perpetually, and the temporal world, God's work and God's realization, is neither negligible nor to be rejected altogether. It is in this sphere that God creates through man. Man cannot create being, but he is free in the domain of spirit and he can transform reality, strive to develop and perfect in it all that is not pure being. This activity is as important as his spiritual and personal progress toward eternity. "Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven." But, in order that man's activity be really creative and responsible, he must be endowed with free-will; he can do right or wrong; he is not deprived of his creative power, even if he does not submit to the will of God.25 These Christian conceptions of spirituality, which do not disclaim the tendencies developed by the Hebrews and Greeks, but enrich them in the perspective of the infinite, do not exhaust the totality of the new message, nor have they always been explicitly emphasized. On the contrary, they were those who object to the anthropomorphism of the idea of a personal God one can reply, with Max Scheler, that it is, rather, a question of the theomorphism of the ideal of person. 25 With regard to this specifically Western ideal of action conceived as the expression of the will of God, one can quote for India the Bhagavad Gitd, which exalts action as the way to God. But, in the Gitd, action must be free from motives and personal purpose, and those who act should not consider themselves as doers, but as performers of the will of God: "As the un- learned act from attachment to their work, so should the learned also act, but without any attachment, with the desire to maintain the world-order" (111.25). In the Western and Christian conception, he who acts should know that he is a free and responsible doer, and, if he acts according to God's will, it is not with the desire to maintain the existing order, but to create a new and better one. He has and ought to have both motives and purposes for his action. In a very interesting paper, "Activism in Indian Thought," in Annals, Bhandarkar O. R. Institute, Vol. 39, Parts III-IV, pp. 185-226, Raju brings out new data concerned with a very different approach to the problem of action in the ancient tradition of India. As it was for the problem of non-instrumental ethics (cf. note 8), he finds it again in the Mimarhsa. In this doctrine, dtman is considered both as agent and as enjoyer. According to Kum-rila, no one acts without a purpose; man is the master of his destiny, and vairdgya, disinterest in the values of the world, is condemned as escapism. The Nairuktas go even farther in their doctrine of activism and process: in striking contrast with the views of other schools, they consider pure becoming (bhava) as the essence of itman. Though this Indian activism has not the creative aspect of Western attitudes, it leads to an exalted humanism ("Man is the Brahman acting in this world," [ibid., p. 213]) closely related to Western conceptions. The existence of such tendencies in ancient India, in the doctrines rooted in pre-Upanisadic traditions, is undoubtedly of great interest for modern Indian thinkers, anxious, under Western influence, to liberate India from its traditional contemplative quietism in order to have a balanced view of life. But the stress laid upon such tendencies is an evidence of modern evolution in India toward the practical aspects of social life, an evolution that appears clearly among the representatives of India at this conference. Yet, it would be difficult to claim that the above-mentioned doctrines confined to secondary philosophical schools (the activism of the Nairuktas is in fact a theory of grammar) have actually molded Indian mentality in its long history. The revival of interest for these long-forgotten theories is the result of the confrontation of Indian reality with the Western world.</page><page sequence="17">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 121 often narrowed, forgotten, or misinterpreted by the Christians themselves and applied to the wrong ends. But the ideal of a determinate and exclusive truth, not liable to various and contradictory interpretations, of universality which does not eliminate individuality, of the full realization of the many- sided nature of man, and of the creative activity striving for the world's better- ment or displayed for the sake of creativity-will remain deeply anchored in the mentality of Western man and will determine the attitude even of those who will turn aside from Christianity, will deny trans-worldly perspectives, and will no longer recognize the origins of their ideals and their dynamism. IV Those who reproach Western civilization with its lack of a deep religious outlook, its ideological relativism and fragmentation, too easily overlook fifteen centuries of its history during which the Western world enjoyed spirit- ual unity of such an intensity that all forms of human life were deeply and naturally permeated with religion. There was a time when the Middle Ages was considered as a period of stagnation and obscurantism; confronted by the masterpieces of its art, literature, philosophy-nobody could today charge the Middle Ages with being devoid of culture and creative spirit. And, as for the reproach of the absence of scientific research, of rigid dogmatism and intolerance, one forgets that this era was one of certainty and universality of faith and that the facts of Christian revelation were for the people of the Mid- dle Ages direct evidence as natural and general as is for a Western man of today the scientifically interpreted image of the world. This evidence was thoroughly subjective but communicable, and even if not always explicable (mysteries of the revelation) yet formulated in terms of conceptual description. And this similarity of formulations between theo- logical and philosophical matters encouraged thinkers, after St. Anselm and Abelard, to try to understand and to demonstrate the revealed dogmas. The boldness and richness of these attempts to rationalize the facts of faith are surprising. If medieval philosophy was ancilla theologiae, it was so in the same measure that modern science is servant to experimental facts. And, even if revelation was the main object of its investigations, it cannot be said that medieval philosophy was one-sided. On the contrary, in the Middle Ages, Western civilization reaches an astonishing equilibrium between faith and reason, between aspirations toward heaven and the full recognition of this world, between the spiritual and the material. This equilibrium finds its most cogent expression in the imposing synthesis of St. Thomas, a synthesis of the two sources of Western culture, and the only ancient philosophical system in</page><page sequence="18">122 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY the West which still remains alive. The main points of Christian revelation find in this synthesis their support in Aristotle, whose doctrine, in its turn, is enhanced by the spiritual outlook which it had lacked. Nature receives here its full recognition, but, while it conserves its material existence, it is spirit- ualized through the form which pervades it; man is presented neither as pure spirit nor as an animal but as mind-body in one individual. Spirit and matter are no longer considered as mutually hostile or contradictory, but as two com- plementary aspects of reality: essence and Lxistence, Grace and Nature, mira- cle and natural law, Church and State. They are different but equally impor- tant stages in the realization of a single purpose of God, in whom essence and existence are identical. This sense of harmony and unity between the spiritual and the material, the eternal and the temporal, is not only the result of philosophical synthesis. It is felt naively and spontaneously by St. Francis, who embraces in his love for God the whole of God's creation, including its humblest forms, and to whom not only animals but even phenomena of Nature, fire, wind, and earth are brothers and sisters, objects and subjects of universal love. The same sense of balance between trans-worldly and worldly affairs appears with those medieval monks who know how to harmonize the via contemplativa with active participation in social works, who are practically the pioneers of or- ganized social relief. The medieval equilibrium was a new way of accomplishing unity without doing away with distinctions, unity toward which the Greeks had striven and which was based on a much more immediate certainty of faith. Thanks to the spontaneous acceptance of a single and unique truth by the whole Christian world, the Middle Ages could establish a real spiritual unity--no longer a postulate, but a tangible fact. This universality, without peer in the history of the Western world, will remain one of the dominant ideals of Western man, even when faith, which provided its foundation, will no longer have the same intensity and the same character of unshaken certainty. This ideal lives in the postulate of scientific universality, which is fulfilled in our time. And the medieval conception of the Civitas Dei, of a world-wide society united by the acceptance of the same and unique truth, will reappear in diverse, even frankly anti-religious, cultural, social, and political activities of the modern world. Greece had created the concept of man as "citizen of the universe." But it is the spiritual community of the Middle Ages that prepared the way for the concept of "mankind." Yet, these great achievements of the Middle Ages contained in themselves the ferments which were to shatter them. Equilibrium and universality, ac- complished in a practical way, ended in a certain fixity of ideal. But this ideal</page><page sequence="19">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 123 encompassed also principles-freedom of the human spirit and its dynamism, which was to operate not only with the view toward eternity but also here, "on earth"--which were in contradiction with any definitely achieved and immutable state of being. And the tendency of emphasizing these trends, which since the last centuries of the Middle Ages are considered as insepa- rable from the spiritual dignity of man and from its lofty mission, will lead, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, to the collapse of the imposing-but static and reduced to a limited area-spiritual, cultural, and social medieval unity. The real foundation of the medieval universality and equilibrium was a harmonious synthesis of faith and reason, and irrational and subjective certi- tude, shared by all Christians ever since it was formulated in objectively de- terminate terms as communicable as the concepts of reason. The universality of this conceptual expression of the credo was similar to "Socratic" rational universality, since it resulted from a collective agreement, the dogmas having been elaborated and mutually tested at the Councils and placed under the guard of the unique authority of the Church. As long as the evolution of the creative thought of medieval philosophers took place in its own field and was not concerned with the basic truths of the revelation, the boldest speculations were allowed (in spite of numerous official condemnations, which were as often revoked, as e.g., the Aristotelianism which, after having been con- demned with Abelard, later became the basis of the official Christian philoso- phy), and even extreme divergencies between the doctrines could not shake the universality of religious certitude. But it was undermined at the very moment when the right to individual free inquiry was extended to revelation itself. This happened in conjunction with both the Renaissance and the Reformation. It behooves us to emphasize that this revolution, decisive in the history of Western spirituality, was not due to the weakening of faith or of confidence in reason, but, quite on the contrary, it happened in the name of the autonomy of faith and reason. In all the Protestant movements, the emphasis was placed upon the sovereignty of faith as not having to bow before any collective authority. Yet, this claim for the rights of subjectivity and of faith independent of rational inquiry did not result in a purely emotional, indeterminable attitude; though hostile to Scho- lastic speculations, the new subjective faiths have been formulated again in conceptual terms, so that divergencies between them did not represent dif- ferent ways of saying the same thing but real divergencies of religious and moral principles. Hence violent conflicts between the d.nominations which broke out in the name of a religion of peace and universal love, but which were the unavoidable expression of spiritual ardor and sincerity of Western</page><page sequence="20">124 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY man accustomed to the idea of a unique determinate supreme truth admitting no polyvalent interpretations. By the same token, revelation could no longer be considered as direct evi- dence common to all people. They felt the need of seeking another source of universal certitude for their knowledge and even for their faith. The philoso- phers of the Italian Renaissance, again taking up Greek traditions, hoped to find it in the universality of reason. This time, however, the method has been reversed: reason had not to explain or demonstrate the truth given with cer- tainty by faith, but it had to take the place of faith and provide the rational foundation of it. And the Renaissance was not a mere return to antiquity; owing to the imposing philosophical work achieved in the Middle Ages, con- fidence in reason has considerably increased. A need for collective search for truth and mutual testing was no longer felt as being necessary; individual reason appeared self-sufficient even in the perspective of the divine. Hence the plurality of mutually irreducible systems, each of them claiming to be universal. Thus, the same era which inaugurated an extraordinary expansion of man's knowledge and a sudden widening of his horizons, which in a few centuries brought about the swiftest and most radical transformations of life, culture, and science that the history of mankind had ever witnessed, produced an ex- plosion which disintegrated the medieval equilibrium in all domains. While getting to know new worlds, Europe was losing its own cohesion. The reli- gious fragmentation provoked by the Reformation was followed by the ap- pearance of modern nationalisms26 shattering the medieval social and politi- cal community. The astonishing progress of science, which, after the failure of rational attempts to justify religion turned exclusively to Nature, shook the balance between the spiritual and material. And, while discovering in himself unlimited potentialities, modern man was losing the inner equilib- rium in which all his faculties had been directed toward a single supreme goal. There arise conflicts between faith and reason (Pascal), between reason and experience (Hume). But it is, above all, the crisis of the criterion of truth which can serve as guarantee both for knowledge and for conduct. No longer sure of the universal validity of the inwardly felt spiritual source of certitude, Western man searches for it outside of himself, in the experience furnished by Nature. This evidence-not only purely physical but also psychological and social-as well as other observable facts, has been and still is considered as the final instance both in science and in philosophical naturalism. Though this new method of knowledge has not restored uni- 26 Cf. F. S. C. Northrop, The Taming of the Nations, chap. XI.</page><page sequence="21">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 125 versality of truth,27 it would be senseless to deny its extraordinary result for our lives and to see merely the wrong side of this particular evolution of Western science. But it would be an equally superficial view to maintain that the scientific and technological progress of the modern world is due exclu- sively to the abandonment of the trans-worldly outlook and to the adoption of the experimental method. Observation as such cannot constitute the basis of any coherent cognition whatsoever. For it to become scientific knowledge it has to be interpreted, i.e., to be supported by the faculty of reason inde- pendent of experience. The fall of the apple would never have led to the dis- covery of the law of gravity if it had not coincided with Newton's rational postulates. And these postulates had not been originated by mere empirical observations. It is really striking that the thinkers who gave Western science its precise methodology-Descartes, Newton, Leibniz-did it much more with a spiritual purpose than out of desire to describe Nature. And the tre- mendous technological application of the results of scientific discoveries is, in spite of its utilitarian effects, above all, the result of the same longing for creative activity which was one of the basic elements of the Western spiritual attitude. Neither a scientific theory nor a technological invention can be explained without the intervention of the creative spirit of man. It is not, as Raju says, "stubborn resolve to analyze and reconstruct the world conceptually at all levels, starting with the lowest concepts at the material level and gradually building up the concepts at higher levels."'2S Scientific method can appear as such only in its didactic presentation, but the very act of scientific discovery is a creative act which starts at the level of reason. And the proof that this kind of reasoning is not a merely academic exercise of our intellect is the transformation of the world it has produced and goes on producing. The objections of Raju can be concerned, rather, with modern Western materialism, which indeed tries to explain "the higher by the lower." But materialism is not based on the experience of the outer world, since matter as such is not observable and is a postulate of reason. And, as for the conviction that matter is the only component of reality, it is simply a fact of irrational faith as unprovable by sensorial evidence as is faith in the existence of spirit- ual values. We find here the same postulate of a unique principle being the source of reality as in most religions-a postulate that no observation can even suggest. It is one more instance of the fact that tendencies and aspira- 27 We have already mentioned the modern ideal of scientific universality. But it is necessary to distinguish practical results of applied science-in which indeed there has been achieved a far-reaching universality-and science as interpretation of the world, as cource of truth. For the latter, in all the fields of scientific research we are still very far from a consensus omnium. 28 EEWP, p. 231.</page><page sequence="22">126 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY tions developed in Western mentality by spiritual doctrines remain alive even when the very notion of the spiritual has been flatly denied. But precisely in the fact that attitudes of Western man, formed through centuries of spiritual training-the need of an absolutely valid faith or knowledge and consciousness of man's creative power enabling him to trans- form the world according to these principles-persist in spite of the loss of a universally recognized truth lie the great dangers of our time. The ancient universal spiritual goal has been replaced by particular and contradictory scientific, national, social, and political ideals, which people, nevertheless, seek to put into practice and to impose with the same conviction or even fanaticism. The troubles which result from this evolution of the Western thought and which also begin to contaminate the East are evident. They ex- plain the desire of numerous Westerners to look for the model of spirituality no longer in their own traditions but in the East. V Yet, as I emphasized at the beginning of my paper, to view Western mod- ern culture only in the light of the above-mentioned facts is definitely one- sided. The crisis of the fragmentation of our culture has been extremely grave, and we have not recovered our unity. But it cannot be seriously stated that the fragmentation of Christian faith has completely undermined the religious outlook of the Western world. It is obvious what an enormous influence Christian religion still exercises today on the hearts and in the thought of men throughout the world, and this, not only among the common people, but in the most prominent representatives of Western culture. And, parallel with the faithful adherence to traditional ideals of Christianity, we must recognize also an extraordinary evolution of thought which, within the Chris- tian tradition or outside of it, not only looks for new bases of spiritual unity, but at the same time fully exercises the creative faculties of the human spirit allowing man to avoid the danger of the fixity and the immutability of the Middle Ages. The main stages of this evolution are generally known, and it is not neces- sary to describe them in detail. My purpose will be merely to try to show that there is some continuity in this maze of apparently contradictory and inde- pendent doctrines. No longer able to depend upon an authority shaken by the crisis of the Renaissance and the Reformation, Western thinkers, with ad- mirable courage, begin anew and at the very beginning. To a certain extent, they begin even at the stages which never had been examined by ancient thinkers: the criteria of any knowledge are now submitted to a severe criti-</page><page sequence="23">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 127 cism. And, as in ancient times, modern philosophers seek a path to the spirit- ual inwardly, trying, one by one, single psychical faculties. The sensorial perceptions, newly discovered as the reliable evidence for the knowledge of Nature, have provided the basis of science only in close union with reason. Pure empiricism could not withstand criticism and ended either in Hume's skepticism or-by a surprising quirk of history-in Berkeley's mystical faith. Once more in the evolution of Western thought it appeared that reason can- not be eliminated. It could withstand the criticism; the very fact that there was no other way to test the validity of reason than to use reason as criterion and tool of control was already a sufficient confirmation. With the Cartesian cogito, the problem of the self-sufficiency of reason (admitted since antiquity without proof) has been, for the first time in the history of Western philoso- phy, put to the test and has emerged victoriously from this trial. And in the Cartesian distinction of res extensae and res cogitantes the difference between spirit and matter has been for the first time emphasized with precision. But what was determining in this distinction-and what allowed all the subse- quent developments of Western idealism-was that reason, identified with spirit, was no longer considered as an element superposed on matter, neither as an attribute of the latter (the intelligible) nor as a faculty which grasps matter, but as an independent reality. Though Descartes himself did not draw all the conclusions of his thesis, the way was cpened for the doctrines which will admit the reality of pure thought needing no support of being or, rather, prior to being, since the latter will be identified either with rational necessity (Spinoza) or with thought grasping itself as object. In this concept of reality not based on being lies a very important difference between modern Western thought and both the whole of Eastern philosophy and Western thought be- fore Descartes. A further important step leading to the exaltation of reason was achieved with the great scientific discoveries of Newton and Leibniz, especially with the invention of differential calculus, which proved that reason was able to conceptualize with precision even the realm of the infinite, which had been previously considered as accessible only by intuition.' Hence the conclusion has been drawn that experience cannot constitute the basis of universally valid knowledge, but that laws precisely formulated by reason lay the founda- tions of experience, and that truth is truth by itself and not because it cor- 29 This great discovery of the capacity of reason to penetrate even into the apparently irrational domains will reveal itself as very fruitful. In its further development mathematics will conceptualize relations and ideas, defying any imagination, and mathematical logic will be able to grasp in precise formulas translogical intuitions, even those of Eastern philosophy, such as the notion of jfnyatd (cf. Hapime Nakamura, "Buddhist Logic Expounded by means of Sym- bolic Logic," Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, VII, No. 1 [December, 19581).</page><page sequence="24">128 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY responds to anything being outside reason. And, since reason could grasp even the infinite, the traditional Western equation, rational = spiritual, has now been reversed: the spiritual became synonymous exclusively with the rational. For Leibniz, intelligence is the unique and fundamental characteristic of the spirit. The whole spiritual tradition of the West is now reduced to ra- tional principles. Virtues such as goodness, justice, and perfection are no longer considered as effects of God's will (as Descartes still admitted) but as reflections of his reason, which in himself dominates his will. The notion of person is now reduced to merely rational elements of remembrance and con- sciousness of what we are. Freedom of the spirit is identified with the state in which man is guided exclusively by reason. And, since the fundamental characteristic of reason is its independence, the human mind cannot be con- sidered as a passive reproduction of God's reason: "Man cannot think with the ideas of another." Thus, in Leibniz's monadology representing the whole reality as a "republic of spirits governed by God" Western spiritual pluralism finds its extreme expression. The great rational systems of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries tended anew to be a kind of definitely established synthesis. But, once more, Western thought did not accept fixity; as in previous cases, the onset came from within: the perfect coherence of rational constructions postulating uni- versality of reason was contradicted by the plurality of irreducible systems appealing to the same reason. There came also the inexorable criticism of Hume demonstrating the limitations of human thought. And once more the failure was a fruitful one: it led to the discovery of the dynamic character of reason. The plurality of systems could be explained as the unavoidable con- sequence of the finite nature of the human mind, which cannot grasp in any definitely achieved system the infinite features of the Supreme Spirit. But, in contrast with the Indian approach to the ultimate, the infinite does not mean in the West the indeterminable: there is a possibility for finite spirits to come near this infinitude, but only by collective efforts and by stages.30 And the proof that these stages are not a mere succession of new speculative construc- tions but can represent a real progress has been furnished by Kant. He suc- ceeded in overarching rationalism and empiricism, not by a mere amalgama- tion of the two opposed methods, but by the discovery of the transcendental method, which allowed reason to rise above itself and to reach a level which embraced both reason and experience. The consequences of this discovery are well known. It was not Kant's 30 Such is, e.g., in our time Brunschvicg's conception of Deus interior, who is conceived as a constant progress achieved by the totality of human minds. Though they are finite, their num- ber in space and in time is infinite.</page><page sequence="25">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 129 skepticism as to the possibility of knowing reality in itself by reason which determined the further development of philosophy, but his discovery of the fact that the knowable is to be sought within us and not in things. The ra- tionalists of the seventeenth century emphasized the self-sufficiency of reason as being a part of reality independent of experience. Now, with the post- Kantian idealists, reality itself was no longer considered as the source of knowledge but as the product of reason. The creative spirit became the unique origin of reality conceived as process and not as an eternally given, static, and immutable ultimate. The discovery of transcendency permitted man to overcome the limitations of finite spirit and gave him the ladder by which he was now able to attain the infinite, since the infinite was also a creation of spirit." By means of successive transcendental syntheses, the post- Kantian idealists attain the notion of absolute reason, the ultimate self-creat- ing principle and the source of reality representing its inner objectivation. With Hegel, this inner activity becomes the very essence of the Absolute Spirit, which exists insofar as it maintains the process of self-creation, being at the same time the creation of reality. As soon as it defines itself as "being," as an achieved result, it dies as an abstraction of knowledge." It would be a commonplace to mention the enormous influence exercised by Hegel, not only in the history of Western thought, but also in the practical aspect, which led to the paradoxical result that this supreme exaltation of the spiritual inspired also radically anti-spiritual dialectical materialism. Fur- thermore, this summit of Western rationalism itself was also to collapse and to produce by reaction a series of positivistic doctrines which, while disa- vowing the work of the most productive centuries of European philosophy, 31 It is the reversal of Leibniz's approach. In his mathematical discoveries, Leibniz found the means to reduce the infinite to the finite. Now, the infinite has proved to be, not an intui- tional vision that discursive thought could conceptualize by means of finite formulas, but the product itself of reason, the expression of its infinite possibility of unfolding itself. 32 The affinities of post-Kantian idealism with Advaita Vedanta or with Vijiianavada have often been emphasized. Yet, the divergencies seem to be more striking than the similarities. In India, to know = to identify itself with the object of knowledge; in post-Kantian idealism, to know = to create. Indian philosophy also knows the creative power of reason (kalpand), but its products are considered as the source of error and delusion, since they superpose artificial hypostases upon the unknowable reality. There can be no dynamic process in the Indian Ab- solute (cf. Raju, EEWP, p. 226: "Deepest truths are eternally accomplished facts"). One can compare the Hegelian unfolding Absolute with 8arhkarian vivarta; yet, vivarta is not the product of Brahman. And, even in the ancient Upanisad, dtman "dies" when it unfolds empiric plurality, when it loses its static transcendency. For Hegel, spirit reveals and enriches its absolute nature when it creates reality. The dynamic conception of the Absolute, which will be predominant in the West also after the collapse of Hegelianism, does not necessarily mean the absolutization of time (though this consequence will also appear in some modern schools of metaphysics). The infinite unfolding of its inner nature by the Absolute is, in Hegel, a logical process, which is accomplished beyond time, the latter being itself the product of reason: it is only necessary for the finite spirit to apprehend this process in temporal succession.</page><page sequence="26">130 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY more than ever denied the validity of any aprioristic creation of reason and, by the same token, for the first time in the history of the West, eliminated as unprovable the very notion of the spiritual. But, also, in the camp of those who continued to believe that the spiritual aspirations and activities of man (which even from the positivistic point of view were facts) could not be explained by anything other than spirit the Hegelian approach was abandoned. This time, there was no possibility of objecting to fixity and rigidity to one of the most dynamic systems of Western philosophy. For European spiritualists, self-sufficiency of spirit and its creative dynamism were unquestionable characteristics of the spiritual. But they re- proached Hegel because of the one-sidedness of his system: spirit appeared to be much more than pure reason. Thus a large proportion of Christian thinkers preferred to return to the well-balanced tradition of Thomism which was enriched by philosophical investigation of modern times, and which has never denied the creative capacity of the human mind, but has limited it to the domain of the temporal. But at the same time there appeared numerous tendencies, faithful to the elan of post-Kantian idealists, but trying to attain the spiritual through faculties of the human psyche other than reason. These tendencies have been initiated already by post-Kantian philosophers. Kant himself opened the way to this enrichment of the spiritual approach, since he emphasized the impossibility for exclusively rational metaphysics to explain both human free-will and the intuition of God or of the immortal soul. The profound feeling of certitude peculiar to this intuition has, accord- ing to Kant, its source in a psychical faculty distinct from reason and called practical reason. This faculty, the very projection of the spiritual in human nature, is the same which much more imperatively, as rational justifications, dictates to us the lines of moral conduct. For Fichte, the moral ego is already the absolute expression of the spiritual. With Schelling, intuition receives a status as important as reason: and its object is being, conceived, not as an all- embracing ultimate, but, on the contrary, as the unique residue of every cog- nition which escapes reason, the absolutely individual "to be there," which defies any generalization. Each of these rediscovered approaches to reality, intuition and immediacy of being, will appear for important philosophical schools of our century as unique ways to the spiritual and will supplant reason in this function. In the system of Schelling, intuition and reason were complementary. Bergson, James, Dilthey, and their followers will oppose intuition to reason as the unique faculty grasping reality directly, while reason through abstraction artificially falsifies its qualitative richness and continuity. These philosophers -especially Bergson, who preached also the mystical approach to the spiritual</page><page sequence="27">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 131 -are often considered as having the most striking affinities with the Eastern philosophical attitude. But even here the differences between the West and the East appear clearly. The final results of the intuitional approach are on the two sides completely divergent. Bergson rejects the intellectual analysis be- cause of its rigidity. According to him, intuition alone can unveil the dynamic character of reality which is action and process. Indian intuitive insight into reality discovers its static immobility and ascribes action and dynamism to the mind or may?, which is not the ultimate. It seems that a much greater affinity to the Indian approach can be found with the existentialists. They try to attain concrete reality lying beyond reason not in the outer world but in the deepest regions of man's psychical life, and at the end of their scrutiny they find being. Yet, in this scrutiny they are not guided by any mystic insight but by an emotional reaction that no rational interpretation can justify: by feelings of anxiety, of disgust, of the solitude of man in the world. And what they find is not all-embracing universal certi- tude, but, on the contrary, the frailest part of the human being, that which in him is absolutely subjective and individual, his existence prior to any deter- mination and synonymous with total freedom to give itself its essence."3 But precisely in this feeling of the frailty of our existence lies the proof of the presence of being which transcends existence and which escapes any attempt to define it. And precisely the fact that it is ontologically concealed empha- sizes the responsibility and autonomy of the human being and constitutes an appeal to free self-transcendence. Thus, even the philosophical approach which reduces the origin of the spiritual life of man to mere existence (a fact which causes existentialists considerable difficulties in the method of philosophical development of their basic principles-they try to avoid abstraction when applying some kind of aesthetic description which has to supplant logical deduction"4) ends in the West with emphasis placed upon the free, dynamic, self-creative character of the individual. And we find the same conception with modern doctrines of personalism, which can be considered as the widest synthesis of all Western attempts to grasp and to justify the spiritual aspirations of man. For the personalists, the really mysterious and yet fundamental insight is not man's 33 Mus points out in his paper in this volume the parallels to Vedainta or Buddhism in Sartre's assertion: "We shall never see that center . . . for we are it," and in that of Mme S. de Beauvoir: "Never shall I become to myself a solid object; what I am experiencing within myself is just that emptiness that is myself." The parallel in itself is very impressive, but the practical implications of this basic indetermination of "myself" are completely different in existentialism, where they lead to total freedom, and in Buddhism or Hinduism. 34 Here lies another striking similarity between Indian and existentialist method, since the Indian pattern of thinking leads also to artistic and symbolic expressions by the means of mandalas (cf. the above-mentioned paper by Mus).</page><page sequence="28">132 CONSTANTIN REGAMEY existence but his existence, the immediately felt unity of all components of his personality, a unity which does not suppress any one of them. Only this richness and variety of human nature can explain its spiritual activities. The doctrines which limit man's activity to merely psycho-physical processes can- not explain its creative originality; and theories which reduce the spiritual to a single higher psychical power forget that man fulfills his self-realization by means of his lower faculties. He has to act in this way because he is the free spirit + being, which latter does not depend on him and determines his in- dividuality and "situation" in the world. As being, he is individual; as spirit, he strives for participation in the universal. As such, he is more than an indi- vidual: he is, or, rather, has to be a person. And person is not an achieved thing: it is a goal, a steady aspiration for self-transcendence. The spirit real- izes himself through reason-in science and philosophy; through will-in moral conduct and practical life; through sensibility-in art. In all these fields he enters into contact with the world, but he reveals himself. Reason al- lows him to introduce through abstract conceptual constructions his own unity in the multifarious and in themselves unorganized data of existence; in art, he reveals to himself the same unity of multiplicity by means of concrete constructions of the sensuous, the unique domain where he can be fully free and creative. In his moral, juridical, social, and political activity, he strives for the same universality and is guided neither by sensibility (by what he merely likes) nor by reason (the intelligent utility of conduct) but by a direct and irreducible-to-other-psychical-approaches intuition of value. If the spirit con- stantly strives to surpass itself, it is because it feels its insufficiency and is conscious of a Supreme Spirit, which is the model and goal of its aspirations. This feeling finds its deepest direct emotional expression in religion. As long as our spiritual components are identified with one single faculty -reason, intuition, immediacy of existence, etc.-the ultimate prototype of it can be conceived as a principle, an impersonal reality. But, when the spirit- uality of the human being appears as the development and harmony of all its components, the Supreme Model and Source of the spiritual appears as a Person, as God. He is infinitely superior to all we can think or feel about him, but he is not indeterminate. He is more than a synthesis because he surpasses every possible synthesis. He is not a static, once-for-eternity-achieved and essentially unknowable and ineffable ultimate, but an infinite richness of eternally expanding expressions which appear to us as models of our own constant and never-achieved self-realization. This is for finite spirits the way to participation in the infinite. The simple discovery of God's presence and passive surrender to his will, or the tendency to be absorbed by his infinitude,</page><page sequence="29">THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SPIRITUALITY 133 constitute abdication and betrayal of the spiritual energy which he bestows on us. Thus, after a long evolution, after many deviations, Western spiritualism constantly returns to this fundamental idea of the dynamic realization of the full nature of man, to the ideal of a person whose purpose and very essence are to surpass itself without ever being satisfied with an achieved perfection. The interpretations and applications of this basic Western tendency can be and have been very many. But it seems impossible for Western man, as long as he is conscious of his spiritual mission, to change this attitude. There appears undoubtedly a radical divergence from the conception of spiritual evolution found in the East. But the constant effort to achieve ever-wider and richer syntheses, as well as the capacity of harmonizing opposites through ever- higher transcendencies, is the basic characteristic of Western spirituality. Perhaps here lies the possibility of finding a point of meeting between the East and the West. Not an orchestrated and artificial unity, nor a compromise, but a higher synthesis in the Western way, which has always striven for universality which does not eliminate distinctions.</page></plain_text>
