<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews 'Both characters are relaxed, in no sense rigid.' Pinter's stage direction for Landscape seems almost impossible to follow in Duff's case. The verbal rape towards the close is the culmination of that 'still violence' Dr Mayberry quotes in rightly seeing the conflict of the play as a 'dissonant juxtaposition of verbal violence and visual stillness'. The third dimension of the plane of memory which Pinter super- imposed on Landscape, Silence, and Old Times does, indeed, create a disjunction of the verbal and visual media: doubly so in Silence since, as the Open University audio tape production showed, an intermittent 'silence' divides the work into a series of young and old voices, which eventually alternate line by line in the final reprise. 'Cognitive dissonance' is surely the case here with this verbal and temporal division and duplication. The strength of Dr Mayberry's study lies in the necessity, given his chosen plays, of recognizing that the conditions of performance formally dislocate the text, not the other way round, as in conventional theatre. Byron's 'theatre of the mind' seems to have been realized at last, or as the author concludes, 'the theatre of discord gives light and sound to the spectacles our memories perform daily for us in the theatre of the mind'. UNIVERSITY OF READING RONALD KNOWLES Views of American Landscapes. Edited by MICK GIDLEY and ROBERT LAWSON- PEEBLES. Foreword by LEO MARX. Cambridge, New York, Port Chester, Melbourne, and Sydney: Cambridge University Press. I989. xxiv + 227 pp. ?27.50. To open his 'Lamp of Memory' chapter in The Seven Lamps of ArchitectureJohn Ruskin recalls an experience of sunset one evening in the pine forests above the village of Champagnole in the Jura. He gives an evocation of the sense of transcendent otherness manifest in the landscape, and goes on to a lyrical description of the particulars of the scene, offering both a wide-angle view which takes in the whole valley before him and an almost microscopic view of woodland and rock-face flowers. It is a scene of 'secluded and serious beauty'; yet, in order to 'read' the 'sources of its impressiveness' Ruskin imagines it momentarily 'a scene in some aboriginal forest of the New Continent'. The result is dramatic: 'The flowers in an instant lost their light, the river its music; the hills became oppressively desolate; a heaviness in the boughs of the darkened forest showed how much of their former power had been dependent upon a life which was not theirs, how much of the glory of the imperishable, or continually renewed, creation is reflected from things more precious in their memories than it, in its renewing.' What is absent from this scene of nature is the sign of man: even the spectral evidence of human history in 'a few stones left one upon another', would be enough, for Ruskin, to revoke the 'forgetfulness of men'. It is a striking feature of this passage that Ruskin should rewrite this scene of beauty through an image of the New Continent, and in this revoking, see American landscape, by implication, as unreadable in terms of human history. Ruskin's sense of the awesome oppressiveness of mere landscape fits well with the evidence adduced by many of the contributors to this volume, a collection of thirteen essays which deal with views of American landscape from the Revolution to the early years of this century, and which variously treat of poetry, fiction, and travel writing, as well as different modes of visual presentation. Mick Gidley's essay on 'The Figure of the Indian in Photographic Landscapes' deals in part with the image of the Indian as a 'child of nature' whose failure to achieve an iconic maturity, in photographic depictions, is equated with the erasure of the sign of the Indian as a consequence of the pioneering drive through the American West: conversely, the repetitious 999</page><page sequence="2">Reviews photographic picturing of the Indian is read as a belated nostalgia for the 'vanishing West'. This pictorial figuring is a failure, or refusal, to read their evidence as a pertinent pre-history to the European settlement of America, despite the 'curiosity' value of ancient Indian ruins in the cafions of the Mesa Verde, the Hopi pueblo at Walpi, or the Taos settlements. So much for Ruskin's few stones! These essays are gathered under three headings, 'Prospects', 'Anglo-American Perspectives', and 'American Illustrations', and as Leo Marx notes in his instructive foreword, these sections deal sequentially with the equivocal patrimony of Old World aesthetics, the textual and visual evidence of Anglo-American relations, and representations of the vernacular style grounded in particulars of the American experience. They uncover a common nexus of problems in the endeavours to read the landscape, whether in literary or visual terms. Following Jacob Burckhardt, Olaf Hansen asserts that our modern experience of nature dates from 1336, the date of Petrarch's account of his ascent of Mont Ventoux, which realizes 'that the use of nature is to turn our view away from it and to direct it towards the self'. Dr Hansen then cites Henry Thoreau, the expeditionary geologist Clarence King, and the photographers Timothy O'Sullivan and Alfred Steiglitz to elaborate that pro- position, and to assert that 'whenever the idea or the concept of landscape becomes a serious issue, the self-definition of mankind will be at stake'. Clive Bush's intellec- tually allusive 'Reflections on the Perception of Space and Landscape' argues that Americans failed to realize the phenomenology of bodily space in relation to the double horizon of America as 'new earth' and 'unredeemed wilderness', and refused the evidence offered in many indigenous and expansionist communities of'ways of living with nature'. Stephen Fender shows how the very deficiency of a usable history in the early Republic led to an insistent emphasis on the trope of anticipation in American writing, and how the instability that arose from that deficiency led to the emergence of a truly original national literature. Two essays in this excellent collection are of particular interest: Robert Lawson- Peebles's reading of Dickens's response to his westward journey down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in I842 offers the best account I have read of Dickens's abruptly horrified revulsion from the American landscape, which becomes a withdrawal from America itself. In place of that received figure of the 'Republic of the Imagination' Dickens was forced into confrontation with a swollen, raging, anthropomorphic 'ditch', whose effects upon him were dislocating and disorientating, in Lawson- Peebles's terms, and were not only filtered into American Notes from his letters but crucially exploited in Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend. Graham Clarke's account of the domestic typology of post-Revolutionary America in landscape painting, which considers the conflict between utilitarian and aesthetic views of landscape common to many of these essays, gives brilliant readings of two genre paintings by Ralph Earl to support his argument for the emergence of a native vocabulary in American painting which survives to this century. There are not enough illustrations in this book, so that one has constantly to go elsewhere to consult the visual evidence these writers refer to: and many of the illustrations given, such as those of Thomas Cole, are barely readable on this scale of production.
