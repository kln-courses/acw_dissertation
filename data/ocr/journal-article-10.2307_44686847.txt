Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The paper describes the use of strain gauge goniometers to measure dummy leg joint angles in impact tests. The instruments have been developed based on regular goniometers used for human gait analysis. Specific modifications enhanced the mechanical stability and the electrical insulation of the sensors. They are now compatible with standard crash data acquisition systems. Several vehicle crash tests have been analyzed using the goniometers as a supplementary measurement device. Due to its low weight, the device does not significantly alter the dummy behavior. Further areas of application are outlined in the paper. INTRODUCTION New injury criteria have been incorporated into the European Safety Regulation for Frontal Impact [1]. One of them is the Tibia Index (TI), a parameter which quantifies the lower leg dummy loads. Experience with full scale vehicle crash tests suggest a large test-to-test variability of the TI. This presents concerns if the effect of design changes shall be quantified on the basis of a single crash test. Therefore it is important to obtain additional data and to understand the loading mechanisms of the lower leg. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION The current Hybrid III dummy leg construction does not allow a direct measurement of the joint angles, even with extended equipment. A new sensor has been developed to overcome this inadequacy. The Ford Cologne Safety Lab developed in conjunction with the British company Biometrics Ltd. special crash resistant strain gauge goniometers, devices typically used for human gait analysis. Measuring dummy limb and ankle motion during a full- scale crash test has been attempted in several manners in the past. In general the sensor should not affect the behavior of the vehicle's structure or the dummy kinematics. Potentiometers: Ball and socket joints as used in anthropomorphic test devices do not allow for the use of simple potentiometer based sensors. Any major modification to the dummy might affect the test results and void its certification for use in compliance testing. Potentiometers are sensitive to high acceleration peaks and have a limited movement rate. High-Speed Film Analysis: On-board high speed cameras are difficult to use due to the space constraints in the vehicle's footwell area and often require modifications to the vehicle's structure. Achieving bright lighting conditions required for the high-speed filming is difficult in these applications. Quantified data is only available when the films are developed, digitized and evaluated. The data accuracy is poor due to the optical distortions and the motion of the limbs in a 3-dimensional array. This arrangement is very complex and often allows only evaluation of one dummy joint per camera. Angular Accelerometers are being used to measure relative motion between the dummy's limbs. These transducers are heavy and difficult to calibrate. Angular rate sensors record absolute angular accelerations that need to be converted to a relative rotation between the adjacent segments. This requires a complex integration algorithm as well as the knowledge of the initial joint angles. This measurement is often not available in crash tests. Also, the number of required data channels is higher compared to the goniometers. Strain Gauge Goniometers are well known in the biomechanics field. Over many years, they have been used to record joint angles during gait analysis or movement analysis in general, for example, at the Institute of Biomechanics in Cologne [2]. However, even the manufacturer of the instruments in the beginning did not believe that these sensitive goniometers (resolution better than 0.1 degrees) could withstand crash environments in which accelerations exceeding 100g's and electrical noise are present, and where high sampling rates are required. The sensors are lightweight (approx. 50 grams) and not sensitive to high accelerations. They are easy to attach to any limb and can withstand high movement velocities. The angular 48</page><page sequence="2">analogue resolution is infinite with an accuracy of +2° measured over 90 degrees. Future Dummy Developments such as ALEX II etc. will integrate conventional angular sensors in the dummy joints. However, these prototypes are not widely available and do not qualify for compliance testing. DESCRIPTION OF THE STRAIN GAUGE GONIOMETER PRINCIPLE The operation of the goniometers is based on a steel wire located under a protective spring between two plastic endblocks. Strain gauges are located along the circumference of the wire ( see Fig. 1). Figure 1. If the angle between the two end blocks changes, the tension along the wire changes in relation to the angle. When the end blocks are moved parallel to each other, the output signal remains constant. Uni-axial goniometers allow for angular measurements in one plane. As shown in Fig.2, angles are measured when the endblocks are moved along the X-X axis. This type of sensor does not measure along the Y-Y or Z-Z axes. Dual-axial goniometers allow the simultaneous measurement of two movements along the X-X and Y-Y axes, if the sensor is properly attached. Torsiometers can measure along the Z-Z axis. Figure 2. During rotation of the limb, the distance between the two endblocks will change. The telescopic endblock can compensate for distance changes between the two mounting points as the limb moves. Afterwards, the sensor returns automatically to its previous position. APPLICATION Dual-axial goniometers are attached at the lateral side of the dummy's ankle joint (see Fig.3 and 5). Plantar/dorsor flexion and inversión/eversión are measured relative to the flat instrument base. The sensor is attached to the limb using adhesive tape and then connected to the data acquisition system. Figure 3. On the knee, a uni-axial sensor is attached in a manner such that the direction of the endblocks falls inline with the upper and lower leg when the leg is fully stretched in the vertical (sagittal) plane. This allows flexion/extension measurement of the knee joint. Extra care has to be taken to avoid damage to the sensor during impact testing. The goniometer is protected by layers of adhesive tape. During its application, the maximum allowed range of motion needs to be considered. Standard goniometers used for general biomechanic use are not suitable for the harsh physical crash testing conditions. Additional screening of the sensors was required to avoid disturbance through electro-magnetic fields generated by the lighting and propulsion systems. The transducers required modifications to suit the needs of the data acquisition system. Additionally, the telescopic range of the endblock has been extended on the custom built goniometers for crash test application. The sensors were attached and wired to meet the SAE-J211 sign convention [3]. TEST RESULTS The knee flexion and ankle joint dorsiflexion of the right leg is shown in Figure 6. The leg was positioned on the accelerator pedal resulting in the ankle joint dorsiflexion occurring slightly sooner than the knee flexion. The ankle joint dorsiflexion motion can be split into three phases: • very little dorsiflexion occurs until the forefoot hits the accelerator pedal. • rapid dorsiflexion until ankle joint locking occurs. • very little motion afterwards due to permanent contact with the joint cage. 49</page><page sequence="3">The knee joint motion is similar to the first two phases of the ankle joint motion, but the range of motion is larger and the third phase allows further rotation. This is due to the fact that no hard end stop is reached in the knee joint during the crash event. Looking at the left leg (see Fig. 7), which was positioned on the footrest, the ankle joint dorsiflexion differs from the corresponding motion of the right leg. In this case, the heel touches the footrest before the forefoot comes into contact permitting the joint to 'open up'. Since the ankle joint locking effect drives the lower tibia bending moments, it is interesting to look at joint kinematics and bending moments simultaneously. Figures 8 and 9 show the ankle joint kinematics and the bending moment (lower load cell) for the right leg. (All bending moments are displayed dimensionless and are scaled individually for easier reading.) On the right side, the My-line shows a typical 'ankle locking spike' at 85ms. Compared to the dorsiflexion ankle, the rise rate is higher because the ankle joint does not transmit bending moments until it locks up. The bending moment peak does not coincide with the maximum dorsiflexion angle. This is due to the inversion of the right foot. The nominal range of motion for dorsiflexion on the foot design used is 45 degrees, but superimposed inversion movement reduces the range of motion because the joint cage is contacted earlier. This is consistent with the fact that, in this case, the peak of Mx coincides with the peak of the inversion. Figures 10 and 11 show the kinematics of the left ankle joint together with the left lower tibia bending moments. No ankle joint locking occurred in the main crash phase. However, after 150ms, My reached a peak (positive sign) right after the dorsiflexion ankle increased a little further. The absolute value of the peak is lower than 40Nm because the deceleration of the dummy is relatively low at this late stage. This is a example of a lucky test result because the ankle joint was very close to lock up at a critical time (around 90ms). Slightly different test conditions could create significantly higher bending moments. The Mx peak occurred around 20ms after the peak of the eversión. This again highlights that the inversion/eversion movement needs to be considered in conjunction with the dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement due to the special shape of the Hybrid III ankle joint cage. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS The goniometers showed the potential to be a valuable tool for crash test analysis. The tibia loading mechanism can be understood much better when the joint kinematics are known. Also, the test-to-test variability of the tibia index can be explained to a certain extent. The instrument itself delivered consistent data. Dynamic calibration tests (foot impact tests using the Hill dummy and high speed cameras as independent device to determine the joint angle) are planned for the near future. Future areas of application could be the dummy neck, spinal bending movement or even structural measurements such as steering column rotation. Better integration in the dummy construction (e.g. the neck) could significantly raise the mechanical protection of the sensors. Goniometers have been used in human gait analysis with lifetimes exceeding 5 years. Therefore the authors feel that strain gauge goniometers can contribute as new sensors to further enhancements of the crash test dummy constructions.
