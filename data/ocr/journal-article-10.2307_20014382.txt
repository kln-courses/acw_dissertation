<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 28, Number 4, October 1991 THE HUME LITERATURE OF THE 1980's Nicholas Capaldi, James King, Donald Livingston X HE article discusses a wide range of books on Hume that appeared during the 1980's, but no claim to completeness of cov? erage is made or implied. Given the large number of important books published, the authors of these essays felt constrained to focus on those books rather than on articles. The essays are intended to be complimen? tary but independent. Each author is solely responsible for the content of his own essay, including the selection of works treated. When "we" appears in each of the following pieces, it is an editorial "we" which expresses the views arrived at by that single author. I. Metaphysics and Epistemology The most remarkable feature of the Hume literature of the 1980's is its sheer volume. Of particular interest was the large number of books. But we begin by mentioning two books that are examples of what Hume scholarship ought not to be. The first is A. J. Ayer's Hume (1980). Antony Flew, in his own book on Hume (p. 119), comments that Ayer has produced "a work which, remarkably, ap? pears to have found no profit in any of the previous forty years of Hume literature." The second egregious example is John Bricke's Hume's Philosophy of Mind (1980). We can do no better than to repeat Annette Baier's words in her review of Bricke {Ethics, January 1982), pp. 346-47: Bricke's whole enterprize is somewhat per? verse. He takes a philosopher whose mission it was to put an end to intellectualist epistemol? ogy and metaphysics...and then forcibly ex? tracts from his words answers to some epistemological and metaphysical questions Hume fairly deliberately avoided. Hume has not succeeded in giving 'a different turn to the speculations of philosophers' like Bricke, for whom the old rationalist alternatives of materi? alism, idealism, neutral monism, and inter actionism are live options. I find Bricke's book a singularly un-Humean work on Hume. It is not that he is wrong in saying that Hume be? lieved that bodily constitution affects mental life, or that mental events have somatic effects. Hume certainly writes often as if he took such things for granted. But his philosophy was not directed at convincing us of such common? places, or at transforming them into metaphys? ical theses....but it seems a sad irony that Hume's novel and rich account of human na? ture, his phenomenology of the whole mind, 'all collected in itself,' should be ignored, while his words are conscripted into service to con? tinue, in the same intellectual style he exposed as futile, the same metaphysical and epistemo logical debates he tried to terminate. Scepticism Three books published during the 1980's on Hume make reference to scepticism in their titles: David Norton's David Hume: Common-Sense Moralist, Sceptical Metaphy? sician (1982); John P. Wright, The Sceptical Realism of David Hume (1983); and Robert Fogelin, Hume's Skepticism in the Treatise of Human Nature (1985). These works are by no means a continuation of the time honored and conventional myth enshrined in text? books that present David Hume as the noto? rious negative and destructive thinker. On the contrary, they are a response to the posi? tive image of Hume that has emerged since the publication of Kemp Smith's The Philos? ophy of David Hume in 1941. Norton, Wright, and Fogelin all concede the earlier gross misrepresentations of Hume, but at the same time all three authors strive for what 255</page><page sequence="2">256 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY they see as a more balanced image of Hume wherein scepticism does have a significant role to play. Norton begins by bifurcating Hume's work in the claim that Hume was responding to two different challenges, a moral crisis and a speculative crisis. Norton further claims that Hume responded to the second chal? lenge by becoming a sceptical metaphysi? cian. According to Norton, Hume answered his Scottish critics both by arguing that what we "must" believe is not necessarily true and by exposing the weaknesses in theological arguments used to buttress those beliefs. Having bifurcated Hume, Norton then goes on to criticize at length the attempt by Kemp Smith to unify Hume's work. Norton specifically attacks what he calls Kemp Smith's subordination thesis, in which rea? son is subordinated to sentiment or feeling or instinct. According to Norton, Hume is not a naturalist precisely because Hume did not thoroughly subordinate reason to in? stinct or feeling (p. 231). The great strengths of Norton's presenta? tion are (1) his attempt to survey the tradi? tional literature of scepticism in order to locate Hume therein; (2) his argument that Kemp Smith really did not get Hume quite right because there are so many contexts in which Hume has reason correcting natural beliefs and in which abstruse reflection has practical benefits; (3) his insistence that Hume's metaphysics be taken seriously. There are, however, serious problems in Norton's work. To begin with, Hume thought and said in no uncertain terms that he was offering a unified vision. It is regretta? ble that Norton did not discuss other at? tempts besides Kemp Smith's to see a unified vision of Hume. Second, Norton's own anal? ysis of traditional scepticisms concedes that Hume did not fit neatly into any previous pattern (p. 279), thereby leaving us wonder? ing just what kind of sceptic Hume is sup? posed to be. In the end, the most that Norton can say is that Hume was a mitigated sceptic, an anti-dogmatist, and that Hume did not disbelieve what he challenged. Not only is this not a new view of Hume, but it is not clear what it adds to our understanding of Hume, after all, to call him a sceptic. Finally, it is not always clear what Norton understands by Hume's metaphysics. Hume's extended discussions of specific metaphysical issues (causality, space and time, self, creation, etc.) are never actually engaged by Norton. Like Kant, Hume criti? cized traditional metaphysics (but I know of no one who claims that Kant is a sceptical metaphysician), and like Kant, Hume recon ceptualized epistemology from the agent's point of view and not the observer's. But most of all, like Kant, Hume asked what this tells us about our world. This can easily be understood as a new vision of metaphysics, but it is one of which one gets no inkling in Norton. John Wright, in his The Sceptical Realism of David Hume, attempts to provide a uni? fied vision of Hume's epistemology and metaphysics in which both scepticism and re? alism play major roles. According to Wright, Hume is a realist who both asserts and pre? supposes that there is a real world indepen? dent of our perception of it (e.g., p. 86,127). At the same time, Hume is alleged to be a sceptic who did develop the negative conse? quences of the theory of ideas (p. 4), that is, Hume showed that our ideas of space, time, matter, cause, etc., as they function in our experience are "inadequate representations of reality" (p. 4). Nevertheless, the realism reasserts itself in two ways. First, the analysis of the inadequacy of our ideas presupposes a real world, and more importantly, the "natu? ral judgments" which supplement our inade? quate notions are explained in Hume by reference to a "Cartesian psychophysiologi cal theory" (p. 5,206). None of the general claims made in Wright's thesis are new, since all of them ap? pear in the Hume literature of the 60's and 70's. Some of the specific claims, on the other hand, are more interesting. Wright believes that "Bale [sic], Descartes, Berkeley and Malebranche" (p. 4) provide the frame of reference for understanding Hume's meta? physics in the Treatise as opposed to Newton (p. 7). Despite making an excellent case for the influence of Malebranche, his anti-New? tonian case is an ignorado elenchi. Three things Wright fails to take seriously are (1) that the University of Edinburgh was</page><page sequence="3">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 257 the first institution of higher learning to teach Newton's natural philosophy and that Robert Stewart, an outstanding proponent of Newton's principles, taught at Edinburgh while Hume was there. (2) Barrow's Mathe? matical Lectures were published in 1734 (as mentioned by Kemp Smith, p. 343), the year Hume began to write the Treatise, and in those lectures one finds the statement that "there can be no such connection [necessary consequence found only in mathematics] of an external efficient cause with its effect (at least none such can be understood by us...") (3) Hume's discussion of space and time is not mere conceptual analysis of isolated con? cepts but reflects the ongoing controversy between Newtonians and Cartesians on whether matter is identical to space, as Descartes argued, or whether matter exists as discrete material atoms moving within space. Recall as well that part of the reason for the Cartesian attempt to equate space and matter was to be able to deduce physics from mathematics. Without reference to the Newtonian-Cartesian controversy and its importance for causation, it is difficult to see why Hume would even want to discuss space and time in the Treatise. Wright's stress on the epistemological scepticism and the de? nial of the scientific background to Hume's philosophy ultimately distorts the positive content of Hume's metaphysics. Once more it appears that focusing on scepticism is less than helpful. An interesting item in Wright's book is the recognition that "in his discussions of the foundation of society, Hume claimed that the mechanisms of the human mind lead us into non-adaptive behavior. He argued that the processes of human nature must be replaced by those of reason and artifice" (p. 192). This is perfectly correct, but it then raises the ob? vious question of what this does to the unity of Hume's philosophy as expressed earlier by Wright. Clearly Wright cannot be right about that unity if the whole of Hume's moral philosophy fails to fit. Perhaps the root of the problem here is that most of Wright's book is narrowly focused on Book I of the Treatise. Robert Fogelin's book, Hume's Skepticism in the Treatise of Human Nature, bears useful comparison to both Norton and Wright. Un? like Norton and Wright, Fogelin considers neither the historical context of Hume's writing nor the issue of the overall unity of Hume's thought. On the other hand, like both Norton and Wright, Fogelin is anxious to stress the importance of a sceptical dimen? sion in Hume that is not overwhelmed by some form of naturalism. Like Norton, Fogelin is writing an anti-Kemp-Smith book, without consideration of other more recent attempts to reformulate Hume as a positive thinker. Like Wright, Fogelin is narrowly fo? cused primarily on Book I of the Treatise, and Fogelin actually claims (p. 3) that there is no essential shift in the First Enquiry. The central theme of Fogelin's work is "that Hume's naturalism and skepticism are mutually supportive" (p. 146). This would seem to mean (1) that the skepticism needs to be supplemented by naturalism (which is, the standard view of Hume since Kemp Smith) and (2) that the naturalism needs to be supported by skepticism. As Fogelin con? strues this second point, Hume allegedly be? lieves that all philosophical views "are natural products of the mind's operations" (p. 149) and that "the activity of criticism is itself natural" (ibid.). It is not clear to this reader how this mutual support thesis is more than a refinement of the Kemp Smith view. The major difficulty with Fogelin's book is trying to see exactly what Fogelin means by skepticism, especially since he identifies so many different kinds. His book should have been entitled "Hume's Skepticisms...," and should have addressed how these different kinds of "skepticism" are related if at all. Fogelin consistently argues that Hume is an "unmitigated epistemological skeptic" (pp. 6,46,146), and what this is supposed to mean is that we cannot "gain knowledge beyond Xhe perceptually given" (p. 65). Here Fogelin is echoing Wright. If it had been Hume's main philosophical intention to advance the claim that knowledge is the grasping through experience of a structure independent of ourselves and that we persistently fail to do so, then Hume could profitably be described as a skeptic. I hasten to add that this is a reading back into Hume of a "meaning" of</page><page sequence="4">258 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY scepticism that still reflects a positivist and analytic bias. Is a sceptic one who despairs of such knowledge (negative view) or one who denies that this is what knowledge is all about (positive alternative view)? The problem with this way of construing Hume is that (a) in the Abstract as well as in the Treatise Hume does not present his epis? temological program as a negative position but gives it a very different and positive cast; (b) in attacking the pretensions of those who think that knowledge is the act of grasping an external structure, Hume's own arguments in? voke or presuppose a whole host of knowledge claims about a world independent of us (something Wright argues for persua? sively!). This would suggest that Hume has an alternative view of what it means to know rather than a negative sceptical program. Part of the problem with Fogelin's exami? nation of specific arguments is his lack of knowledge of both Hume's historical con? text and of some of the secondary literature (e.g. Anderson's book is not cited in the bib? liography). One example of this is that Fogelin claims to find an important argu? ment in Hume that others have ignored. That argument is the one in which Hume first reduces knowledge to probability and then reduces probability to nothing. Fogelin takes great issue with this argument. What Fogelin does not recognize is that the argu? ment did not originate with Hume but was already well known and found at least as early as Descartes. Fogelin does not consider the possibility that it was Hume's purpose to discredit certain forms of rationalism not by developing an argument but by turning the argument rhetorically against his opponents. Antony Flew's book, David Hume: Philos? opher of Moral Science (1986) is a much more balanced presentation than Fogelin's. Flew stresses the extent to which a Cartesian starting point does generate skeptical prob? lems on which Hume failed to follow through. However, Flew maintains that Hume did not do so in the interest of his positive program. Flew construes Hume's skepticism both as a matter of temperament, not "specific doubts and disbeliefs" (p. 115), and as a functional part of Hume's secular conservatism. Causation The superficiality of the sceptical thesis be? comes apparent as soon as one engages in a sustained in-depth analysis of central meta? physical issues in Hume. No issue is more cen? tral for Hume's metaphysics and epistemology than causation. Fortunately, two very good books appeared in the 1980's on Hume's view of causation. The first and most thorough to date is Hume and the Problem of Causation, by Tom L. Beauchamp and Alexander Rosenberg (1981). Beauchamp stresses the importance and function of Hume's having two accounts of causation, one is a real ontological ac? count of causation and the other is an ac? count of the genesis of causal beliefs (psychological account of the belief in neces? sary connection). This is followed by an em? phasis on spatial contiguity as well as temporal succession in Hume, an emphasis that obviates misrepresentation of Hume as a phenomenal regularity theorist. There is also a very subtle discussion of causal directionality. Beauchamp and Rosenberg persistently relate Hume's views to contemporary discussions of induc? tive scepticism, counterfactuals, and causal explanation, always making clear how Hume has been misrepresented and just how de? fensible and insightful his views still are. Two elements in the Beauchamp and Rosen? berg book are worthy of special comment. First, their book is still the only comprehen? sive treatment to date of causation in Hume, and it is one of the few books on any major philosopher that attempts to combine both careful textual exegesis and prolonged philo? sophical argument in defense of the philoso? pher. Second, they have presented the best argument to date that Hume was not an in? ductive sceptic, much to the detriment of the work of Will, Popper, Kneale, Bennett, Stroud, and Stove. The second attempt to rescue Hume's ac? count of causation from the sceptical thesis is by Galen Strawson in The Secret Connexion: Causation, Realism, and David Hume (1989). Building on the work of Wright, Livingston, and Beauchamp and Rosenberg, Strawson erects a substantial case for recognizing that Hume believed in "causal power or natural necessity" (p. ix). Strawson makes an impor</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 259 tant distinction in Hume between the onto? logical claim that there is causation in objects and the epistemological claim of how much we can know about it (p. 219). Certainly Strawson seems correct in saying that Hume believed in causation as a real power in ex? ternal objects as well as believing that its ulti? mate nature remained something of an ontological mystery to us. On the other hand, Hume did not himself equate, as Strawson does, causal power with necessary connec? tion. This was a further distinction Hume went to great lengths to make. Here a consid? eration of the historical context of Hume's argument would have been helpful. Never? theless, it is impossible to read the works of Beauchamp and Rosenberg and of Strawson and ever again have serious doubts about whether Hume was sceptical about the real? ity of causation. Unity of Hume's Philosophy There were three significant attempts dur? ing the 1980's to see Hume whole. Arehy Botwinick's Ethics, Politics, and Epistemol? ogy: A Study in the Unity of Hume's Thought (1980) was the first. What Botwinick stresses is the extent to which Hume's philosophy has to be seen from the point of view of the agent. Botwinick claims that Hume has a "vindicationist paradigm for doing philoso? phy in his ethics, epistemology and political theory" so that "Hume finds no form of ar? gument satisfactory that does not include a reference to the internal make-up of an agent" (p. 161). If Botwinick is correct, then we can use this insight to rebut a charge against Hume's answer to the sceptic. Both Norton and Fogelin dismiss Hume's refuta? tion of the sceptic that points to the sceptic's conduct as being inconsistent with his stated position. Fogelin describes this as a "vulgar ad hominem" (p. 5). On the contrary, if thought must be understood by reference to agency, as Botwinick and others claim is Hume's posi? tion, then there is from Hume's point of view an internal incoherence in scepticism. The con? cept of agency is, by the way, much richer than Kemp Smith's notion of feeling. The crucial importance of agency in Hume's philosophy was highlighted as well by Peter Jones in his Hume's Sentiments: Their Ciceronian and French Context (1982). Jones specifically draws attention to the rele? vance of agency to the rebuttal of scepticism (p. 186). More generally, Jones attributes to Hume the position of the Ciceronian human? ist for whom "abstract speculation ought to be subservient to practical morality" (p. 175) and to whom "philosophy could legitimately only be based on, and be justified by refer? ence to, the pre-reflective views of common life" (p. 4). What Jones adds to Botwinick's stress on agency is the social dimension of agency so that "knowledge has an essential social dimension" (p. 175). Jones' treatment contains a wealth of insights including (a) a recognition of the Kantian direction of Hume's thought (p. 175), (b) a recognition that the French context extends way beyond Malebranche, and (c) the claim that the lim? its of scepticism are not knowable in advance but discovered by trespassing them (p. 175). Donald W. Livingston's Hume's Philoso? phy of Common Life (1984) has become a significant landmark in Hume scholarship. What Livingston contributes to the attempt to see Hume's work as a whole is a stress on the fundamental significance of historical narrative in Hume to all of human thought. Livingston reveals how the epistemology is itself better understood from an historical perspective. The result is a picture of Hume as a serious "historicist" philosopher and the originator of secular philosophical conserva? tism. History, not natural science, becomes the chief paradigm of knowledge for Hume. Common life is the sum total of past cultural practices that have emerged largely un? planned and unintended into a framework in terms of which we both interpret the world and make practical decisions. As such, common life contains implicit norms, and the job of the phi? losopher is to explicate those norms. In addi? tion, philosophers have the therapeutic function of exposing violations of that frame? work even in the work of other philosophers. According to Livingston, true philosophy for Hume "presupposes the authority of common life" (p. 3) which thereby gains a kind of transcendental status. False philoso? phy comes about when we try to make com? mon life an object of critical reflection. The attempt to do so is an attempt to turn philos</page><page sequence="6">260 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY ophy itself into an autonomous discipline with an authority of its own. This autonomy principle is what leads to total scepticism. While theoretical activity presupposes the pre-theoretical, the pre-theoretical cannot be theorized about, only explicated. There is a curious lack of integrity in false philosophy since it is itself (like some "sceptical" argu? ments) only intelligible when it presupposes the correctness of common life. Conse? quently, Livingston is led to stress the impor? tance of paying attention to the style and rhetoric of Hume's writings when Hume is busily engaged in exposing such a lack of integrity. Livingston's book is an outstanding contribution to our understanding of the unity of Hume's philosophy. Two other books are worthy of special mention. First, Richard Murphy's Hume and Husserl (1980) is a reminder of the impor? tance of Hume for continental philosophers. Murphy shows how Husserl was inspired by Hume and Descartes to take a radical sub? jective path; how, like Hume, Husserl was led to see that the ego could not be fully concep? tualized; and how, like Hume, Husserl was led to relate the ego to concrete life. The second book to challenge conven? tional Anglo-North American readings of Hume is Ezra Talmor's Descartes and Hume (1980). Talmor argues persuasively that, dif? ferences aside, Descartes and Hume were both engaged in a common enterprize, namely, undermining the prevailing Aristo? telian scholasticism. Toward this end, Hume as well as Descartes had to develop new rhe? torical forms of expression in order to gain the attention of the audience. Specifically with regard to Hume, Talmor argues that Hume was not a sceptic about causation but was reacting against scholastic (i.e. Aristote? lian) notions of causality. Rather than im? pugning the objective validity of scientific knowledge Hume was attempting to guaran? tee the objective validity of science by elimi? nating the anthropomorphism of the belief in occult powers. "To assume that causation is more than concomitancy is to commit the error of assuming something in the object over and above what is present and accessi? ble to the understanding" (p. xiv). Contrary to the conventional view, Talmor argues that the theory of ideas is a positive part of the experimental method and that it specifically helps to reveal the extent to which our think? ing involves projecting onto objects our in? ternal attitudes. Finally, Talmor suggests that Hume's mitigated scepticism was designed to undermine classical scepticism. University of Tulsa Received December 7,1990 II. Recent Work on Hume's Moral Philosophy Given the number and significance of re? cent books dealing with Hume's moral the? ory, in what follows we can discuss only some of the contributions of the last decade?spe? cifically work by Baier, Capaldi, Fogelin, Harrison, Jones, Mackie, Miller, and Norton. We shall not be reviewing the rich journal literature to appear in the 1980's?all we can do is mention splendid articles by such au? thors as Brown, Costa, Davie, Flage, Lipkin, Nuyen, A. O. Rorty, Russell and Vodraska (as well as papers in Hume Studies (1988) and in the Journal of the History of Philoso? phy (1988) advancing some novel views on Hume's theory of morals). Moreover, we are neglecting (hopefully to be taken up on an? other occasion) the interesting work on Hume's moral theory that has appeared in books devoted to some other theme or fig? ure?Audi's Practical Rationality (1989) where one finds a novel discussion of Hume on moral weakness; Maclntyre's Whose Jus? tice? Which Rationality? (1988) where the author continues the critique of Hume begun in After Virtue, Dilman's Studies in Language and Reason (1981); and two stud? ies of Scottish theoretical work on justice, Hamowy's The Scottish Enlightenment and The Theory of Spontaneous Order (1987) and Haakonsenn's The Science of a Legisla? tor (1982). We have chosen to begin by discussing David Fate Norton's David Hume: Com? mon-Sense Moralist, Sceptical Metaphysician (1982) because the author deals with a ques? tion which appeals to us and because this is a quite valuable study in its own right. Norton advances the daring thesis that Hume's work</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 261 is fundamentally disunified: in metaphysics Hume is a skeptic, in morals an antiskeptic. To motivate this thesis Norton characterizes as moral skepticism a position attributable to Hobbes from which he says Hume would very much want to distance himself; the ac? count of morals which in Norton's view Hume gives is a thoroughly positive account, one which comprises a powerful role for rea? son and involves a moral cognitivism in its epistemological component and a form of moral realism in ontology. In developing his thesis Norton presents some very good work on Hume and on Hume's predecessors (from Descartes down to Turnbull and Kames). Arguing against the Kemp Smith interpretation obliges Norton to take a fresh look at Hutcheson, resulting in the extraction of an account of sensible ideas correlating with moral objects as "signs of the moral nature of these actions and affec? tions" (84). Concomitant to these he finds "the ideas of virtue and vice, which are representa? tive of external or objective moral reality" (86). Norton is able to develop his moral realist reading of Hume by linking him to Hutche? son thus understood and by insisting on Hume's claim that the moral distinctions, or virtue and vice, are a matter of fact, per? ceived through feeling, not established by reason (T. 469). He argues that Hume is com? mitted to the view that the moral sentiments are "affective responses to publicly available aspects of the world" (112) and point to something beyond themselves?unique properties or moral qualities that are "the objective correlates of sentiments" (111). In short, there are: (a) moral reality, (b) moral feelings, (c) causal relationship between these, and (d) an epistemic relationship be? tween them (149). Norton also claims that in metaphysics and epistemology Hume is indeed a skeptic, con? tending that we are utterly shut off from at? taining any ultimate knowledge of reality; as a result we have no genuine standards for judgments of truth and falsity. Probably the strongest support for Norton's thesis that there is a radical difference between Hume's theory of morals and his epistemology is the claim (T. 546 f.) that the moral sentiments provide, in the consensus of mankind, an in? fallible standard by which even matters of theory may be gauged, while in nonmoral matters there is no corresponding standard (but see 143, n. 63). Norton offers a broad target, and can be challenged on three fronts: (a) that in morals Hume was not a realist, (b) that in metaphys? ics he was not a skeptic, and (c) that however Hume's positions in morals and metaphysics are interpreted, they are not disunified. Of these the third is the most interesting ques? tion, and in considering whether what is going on in Book III of the Treatise is radi? cally different from what Hume is doing in Books I and II, Lewis White Beck's paper, "Was-Must Be and Is-Ought in Hume," (Phil. Stud. 1974) strikes me as a good place to start. In arguing that parallel nonrational ist accounts may be given of necessary con? nection and of the moral ought, Beck suggests there is continuity first between the skeptical arguments of Books I and III and second between Hume's positive accounts of causal thinking and of moral thinking. Fol? lowing this lead if one entertains the notion that there is a skeptical Hume and a positive Hume both in metaphysics and in morals, one might extend the Hutcheson-inspired construal of moral judgment to causal judg? ment, arguing that the felt disposition to link cause and effect seems to point beyond itself epistemically and serves as a sign of a real causality; from this one might conclude that the positive (i.e., nonskeptical) Hume is a causal as well as a moral realist; or one might conclude, if Hume is not a causal realist, then neither is he a moral realist. One may also find that both domains comprise parallel conditions of assertability as well as parallel conditions of corrigibility (consider the rules for causal judgments at T. 173 ff.), so that either both admit of truth or neither does. But what of the text at T. 546 f. which pro? vides much of the leverage for Norton's reading? It might be argued that consensus is irrelevant to Norton's cognitivist-realist in? terpretation of the moral sentiment. But still, Hume did not?and we think would not? say, "there is just so much belief-worthiness in any causal judgment as everyone places in it." While Hume cannot make consensus a</page><page sequence="8">262 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Standard of belief-worthiness, yet at a deep level it seems he can do in the domain of causal thinking one of the things he does at T. 546, namely, claim that if a metaphysician should advance an opinion which counters the universal judgment of mankind?e.g., the opinion that there is no such thing as causal thinking or that all causal beliefs are delusions, then that metaphysical opinion must be mistaken. In short, either one must argue that in causal judgments there is a con sensualism parallel to that detailed at T. 546 f., or one must be prepared to write off T. 546 f. as hyperbole, or one must grant Norton his point. As for the motivation Norton furnishes for denying Hume is a moral skeptic we think the argument would have been stronger had there been evidence internal to Hume's thinking?as showing, for instance, that something in either his skeptical program re? quired moral realism, or (as seems more likely) that something in his moral program required metaphysical skepticism. It would also have been helpful had Norton's thesis been contrasted not just with a crude subjec tivist interpretation but with a sophisticated projectionism, some forms of which can ac? count for mind-independent objectivity of the Humean moral judgment. Even if it turns out that his thesis does not hold up in every particular, Norton is surely right to argue that Hume attributes a reality to the moral distinctions far beyond what the bulk of the twentieth century interpreters of his moral theory have allowed. Both as a corrective and in substance, this is an important contri? bution to Hume scholarship. In Hume's Moral Theory (1980) the late J. L. Mackie offers an eminently readable com? mentary, of a little less than one hundred pages in length, on the moral philosophy of the Treatise (Bk. Ill and Book II, iii. 3). In contrast to Norton's moral realism thesis, we may note that Mackie says Hume's question is set by Hobbes and his answer is close to Hobbes (150). His approach will be familiar to readers of Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (1977). The interpretation Mackie champions is that Hume embraced the view that the mind projects the moral predicates onto the human scene. He sees this as a quasi-realism, sharply to be distinguished from the views that Hume was either an emotivist or a pre scriptivist. Mackie claims some textual basis for his interpretation but also asserts that it has the advantage of being the indepen? dently correct construal of the nature of mo? rality. We cannot say Mackie's contentions are altogether persuasive. In the sharpest statement of his view Mackie says "the features ascribed to actions (etc.) in the distinctively moral (categorically imperative) part of statements are fictitious, created in thought by the projection of moral sentiments onto the actions (etc.) which are the objects of those sentiments" (74). Here we find two defects. First, there is no reason to saddle Hume with the view that the term moral signifies something categorically im? perative?if anything, he could be called upon as an ally by those who today would argue that it is just a mistake to think of mo? rality in such terms. Second, we must fault Mackie for fashion? ing a dish he can both have and eat. In his interpretation he wants to feature in Hume the "ordinary moral statements' claim to ob? jectivity and authority" (74), but his pro jectionism commits him to denying that Hume is an objectivist in an ontologically interesting sense. Subjectivist interpreta? tions of Hume's ethics are familiar enough, and objectivist readings are gaining support, but their adherents present these as mutu? ally exclusive. To make out a view such as Mackie's one must either show?which Mackie did not?how these contrasting ele? ments figure in a unified interpretation or conclude that Hume's projectionism ulti? mately makes the opinion of objectivism it? self either so weak as to be uninteresting (the more charitable reading) or illusory. And if the latter is recognized as the likelier alterna? tive, the amalgam Mackie describes turns out to be an example, in fact, of the vulgar system of whose subversion Hume writes in the famous is/ought passage (T. 469 f.), a sys? tem which involves taking, or rather mistak? ing, the moral distinctions to be objective. Thus, however things may stand in Mackie's independent account of morality, such an undifferentiated juxtaposition of ob</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 263 jectivism and subjectivism is not Hume's. We think there is room in a projectionist inter? pretation of Hume for objective considera? tions that are conditioned by felt responses (of a sort which on Mackie's view seem to count as subjective). Such a projectionism could still account, moreover, for the author? ity and (weak) objectivity which Mackie thinks are involved in "the central meaning of typical moral statements in ordinary use" (74) in terms of a causal story of the fairly standardized conditions under which per? sons, starting from such felt responses, come to speak a common language of morals. Mackie is at his best in discussing the arti? ficial virtues, a neglected portion of the Trea? tise. While many of his specific comments on Part II are helpful (especially his discussion of international justice), Mackie perpetuates the mistake of treating the self-interest of the preconventional and of the postconventio nal sort as being identical, unaffected by the experiences, reasons and transactions origi? native of justice. Further, it is baffling why in his excellent discussion of the famous oars? men example Mackie overlooked the possi? bility that each rower tugs on a different oar. Mackie recognizes that the Enquiry account of the origin of justice is much different from that of the Treatise (153), but he does not explore the significance of the shift?a sig? nificance not lost on Capaldi. There is much more to be mined from Mackie's treatment of the artificial virtues, as well as from his suggestion that the is/ought passage points beyond itself to Part II of Book III. This is a work in moral theory with a con? temporary flavor, not a work in the history of moral theory. Even in the two chapters de? voted to historical figures, Mackie treats thinkers like Clarke, Hutcheson, Price as place-holders in a 1980's dialectic of objec? tivism v. sentimentalism in moral theory. Al? though the discussion of such problems is interesting, here one finds little of the sensi? tivity to historical circumstance and to devel? opment in Hume's thinking that is so evident in the work of writers like Capaldi, Jones, and Norton. But though the purist may scorn Mackie's work, we find much to praise. First, Mackie has a fine synoptic grasp of essen? tials?the introductory chapter provides as good a six page outline of Hume's ethics as one can find anywhere. Second, some form of projectionism, if not precisely the one Mackie attributes to Hume, is not an implau? sible reading of the Treatise theory of morals. Third, the general thesis Mackie argues re? garding Part III, that even the natural virtues are partly artificial, is an important point which likewise merits attention. Fourth, he gives some valuable criticisms of Hume as Mackie reads Hume and even raises some unhandled questions?e.g., why, if it is largely an artificial construct, morality should be thought to be worth the price (154 f.). Finally, even when he is mistaken?and it is not awfully hard to detect where, given his aims and prejudices, Mackie goes wrong, he is a lucid writer and one whose arguments are worth grappling with. Contrasting interestingly with Norton's book is Robert Fogelin's Hume's Skepticism in the Treatise of Human Nature (1985), of which we shall concentrate on the two chap? ters dealing with the passions and with mor? als. Fogelin articulates an interpretation which emphasizes the skeptical Hume against a growing number of studies which subsume the skepticism within a larger pro? gram. This is a compact and tightly argued book; the arguments are generally quite clear; the author is honest in dealing with the material. Whereas Norton breaks his own ground, Fogelin follows Mackie and Stroud, attributing a kind of projectionism to Hume, but in both morals and causal thinking. The full weight of Fogelin's argument that Hume is an unmitigated skeptic in morals depends on texts such as in "The Sceptic" where one reads, "objects have absolutely no worth or value in themselves." The case strikes us as being weaker than Fogelin would have it, though he has the candor to admit that the argument comes down pretty much to how one interprets the willful mur? der example at T. 468 f., and he spends only a few pages on it. Fogelin concludes that "emotivism (or some other version of non cognitivism) seems quite plausible within Hume's general framework" and that on Fogelin's own view "evidence cannot be used to support our moral pronouncements and, if this is so, it is hard to see what the</page><page sequence="10">264 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY propositional status of a moral pronounce? ment comes to?or at least why it should be so important to insist upon it" (142). (For a nonemotivist projectionist account, see Flew.) He also has the honesty to acknowl? edge that "there is something strange about the notion that we project our feelings upon the world.... What is needed here is an ac? count of this relationship between feelings and projected qualities. Without this, it will be hard to choose between the position of common sense and that of the projectionist" (143 f.). What we found of greatest interest in Fogelin was his applying the thinking ad? vanced in Hume's essay, "The Sceptic," to our understanding of Hume's moral theory. Consistent with his view that Hume never really moved away from the positions of the Treatise, he claims that "this essay is an im? portant aid for understanding both Hume's account of the relationship between reason and the passions...and his account of the re? lationship between reason and morals..." (117). What Fogelin finds in the essay is "a theory of the way in which a change in belief can bring about a change in attitude, but the rhetorical point of the essay is not to elabo? rate this doctrine, but to point out that philo? sophical thought, i.e., abstruse reflection, can have little effect in this way" (120 f.). Indeed, the essay suggests, on Fogelin's view, that if a philosophy is to provide moral guid? ance, it must be a philosophy which draws on common life; and the lesson which such a philosophy of common life inculcates will be one of moderation. An important theme of the essay which Fogelin does not touch upon in his brief exposition?and perhaps one which really does go beyond the Treatise?is Hume's challenge to the entrenched ratio? nalist dogma that the specific role of the moral philosopher is to address questions about the starting-point for moral think? ing?the [final] end. (See Essays, Miller edi? tion, 160 ff.) How a thinker like Hume can do moral philosophy without a concern for such questions is, we think, a theme which makes this essay, as Fogelin suggests, much more important than has been recognized. Fogelin discusses Hume's moral theory with a view to confirming his general thesis that Hume is an unmitigated skeptic, and thus his unified approach contrasts with Norton's thesis; but in presenting a Hume who is by turn skeptic and naturalist, Fogelin faces the problem of showing the unity be? tween these two elements of his portrayal of Hume. Moreover, although he shows how Hume can be read as a skeptic in morals, he does not actually show us, in our opinion, the Hume who represents a naturalism in morals. For several reasons Nicholas Capaldi's Hume's Place in Moral Philosophy (1989) must be classified as a very ambitious study. First, Capaldi offers and defends an interpre? tation of Hume's moral theory and overall philosophy which is new (for we can find no single figure or school which gives Capaldi's thinking the direction it has taken) and seri? ously challenges the accepted views. Second, Capaldi gives a genuinely comprehensive picture of Hume's moral theory and goes farther than any other writer with whom we are acquainted to relate the mainline philo? sophical writings, the Treatise and Enquiries, to the neglected portion of Hume's corpus, the Essays and History. (This alone recom? mends Capaldi's book to every Hume scholar.) Further, in this book one encoun? ters as complete a survey of the scholarship on Hume as one can find anywhere. Third, Capaldi's thesis that Hume is a revolutionary thinker has, when combined with the fact that subsequent philosophy has proceeded unaffected by that revolution, the implica? tion that twentieth century philosophy has misread Hume and, more, that to appreciate Hume one must break out of the grip of that tradition. Accordingly, Capaldi's book has something of an evangelical tone, dividing the philosophical world into the sheep and the goats, and inviting the reader to find in Hume a much wiser philosophy than avail? able in the ancient or in the contemporary traditions. As a result, there is a very great deal going on in Capaldi's book, especially when in the final chapter he essays what we take to be the relating of the spirit of Hume's philosophy to our contemporary philosophical scene. Capaldi's central thesis is that Hume gave philosophy a new character which he de? scribes as a Copernican revolution in philos</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 265 ophy. This revolution consists in abandoning epistemological individualism, the dominant mode of thinking from Plato and Descartes, and undertaking reflection from a perspec? tive at once social, practical and radically his? torical. "Part of Hume's originality was that he was thinking in pragmatic or action-ori? ented terms and that he tested his theoretical conclusions against the standard set by prac? tical requirements" (21). From the old per? spective "human beings are conceived of as isolated thinking subjects in contrast with a world of objects. The task...is a theoretical one, namely to discover how the world of objects really is" (22). Working within the social-practical perspective, on the other hand, "Hume viewed human beings funda? mentally as agents, as doers, immersed in both a physical world and a social world along with other agents.... Instead of at? tempting to scrutinize our thought process in the hope of uncovering principles of ratio? nality which could be applied to directing our action, Hume reversed the procedure. He began with our practice, our action, and sought to extract from it the inherent social norms" (23). Basic to Capaldi's interpreta? tion, then, are three points: (1) all philosoph? ical thinking presupposes a structure of social practices in place; (2) there is no tran? scendent standpoint and "no technical form of thinking (including mathematics and physical science) can itself be understood ex? cept by appeal to something which is pre technical (common sense)" (296). Thus theory is dependent on practice, not practice on anything theoretical (296). "This is, of course, Hume's Copernican revolution in philosophy in general and the starting point of the Treatise''' (285); and (3) philosophy can explicate practices but cannot give a ground up explanation of practices: it is "logically impossible to explore the hidden structure of our practice" (283). Capaldi claims that rec? ognizing the Copernican revolution will "overcome the difficulties usually attributed to Hume, and it will show him to be a consis? tent and powerful moral philosopher" (27). Accordingly, Capaldi denies that Hume, since he holds Hume asserts the existence of an independent physical world, is properly to be characterized as a skeptic (27); he sug gests that what Hume offers is a positive al? ternative to skepticism. With regard to Hume's views on reason, it is characteristic of Capaldi to urge, "What Hume is suggest? ing is that we reconceptualize the vary no? tion of reason itself. Reason cannot be understood from an independent theoretical perspective, rather it must be understood relative to action" (26). He also denies that Hume is a naturalist, i.e., one who "attempts to explain human agents from the point of view of other natural processes" (297); rather, Humean explications take as given and work from within our social practices. Capaldi also argues that Hume is not a moral realist in the strict sense but an inter subjectivist whose position is best explicated in terms of the social practices perspective he contrasts with that of the Cogito. Admitting that Kemp Smith is wrong to think Hume subordinates reason to instinct or feeling, Capaldi contends that Norton failed to es? tablish that the moral sentiments are objec? tive (318, 320). Since Capaldi claims that "the intersubjectivity one finds in Hume's moral philosophy is certainly to be found in Hume's epistemology and metaphysics as well," he differs from Norton in asserting a basic unity to Hume's philosophy. Turning now to the discussion of Hume's moral theory, we shall limit discussion to three points which we think deserve particu? lar mention. First, Capaldi offers a unique construal of the is/ought passage. To begin, he claims that what has become the standard reading cul? minating in the so-called "Hume's Law" is radically mistaken; Hume allows transition from fact to value as Hume conceives fact and value; the facts, however, are facts within the practices and moral culture which serves as the necessary starting-point for our reflec? tion (facts informed by norms already em? bodied in our practices) (295). If one objects that the transition is supposed to be from pure or "nonmoral" facts, Capaldi counters that this is the wrong way to pose the ques? tion, and further, that Hume believes there is no condition of men (state of nature) where the world in which we live is one of nonmoral facts. Distinguishing informal uses of ought from how this term figures in philosophical</page><page sequence="12">266 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY systems?where it represents the specific moral category, Capaldi fastens on to the part of the passage in which Hume, in the voice of the proponent of vulgar systems, as? serts that "ought or ought not expresses some new relation"?specifically the alleged relation between rationalists' moral princi? ples and action or conduct (though we note that Hume's text reads: "...new relation or affirmation"). He then reviews Hume's the? ory of relations and shows that it is impossi? ble ought might consist in any known relation. And he concludes that therewith Hume has eliminated the notion that to ac? count for morality we must posit a specific moral category. Although we learned much from Capaldi's discussion and think it is must reading for any student of the Hume's moral theory (particularly the quite thorough dis? cussion of rival interpretations), we enter? tain some nagging doubts. First, construing the passage in terms of Hume's account of relations, while satisfactory as a way of expli? cating what Hume might have intended, lim? its its import to the context of that account and its presuppositions; and we would like to think that the point Hume makes in the pas? sage is of wider impact?as Hume's language in the passage pretty clearly suggests he in? tended. Moreover, that ought does not con? sist in a relation leaves open the other alternative, namely, that it might be a new affirmation?a point that contributes to con? clusion that Hume's arguments do not refute ethical intuitionists like Clarke and Price. Fi? nally, it seems to us that Hume admits there is such a thing as a specific moral category, even if it is not to be identified with the order of the ought, and even if it is not discerned by reason alone; in other words, the moral order is distinguishable from other orders? as the paragraph preceding the passage shows?as one identified by the sentiment of morals. Second, Capaldi offers a welcome discus? sion of Hume's views on the self. The self is a composite of mind and body, of which the idea is complex and emerges within the per? spective of social practices as the object of the passions of pride and humility, and which idea, with transfer of vivacity, becomes an impression of the self (170-176). It seems to us that, consistent with his overall portrayal of Hume, the author might well have capital? ized on how the self is itself a social con? struct, dependent in fact on the resources of society for its enrichment and vitalization. (But perhaps the author is planning a sepa? rate study of Book II.) Last, Capaldi has some very interesting things to say on the internalism/externalism controversy (though we hasten to add that he does not connect his views on moral knowledge and moral motivation to this con? troversy). Capaldi contends that Hume is a moral cognitivist but of an antirationalist type. "For Hume moral knowledge is empir? ical matter of fact knowledge similar to our knowledge of all secondary qualities... [but differing] in that the kinds of intersubjective rules that form the framework of our reac? tion have evolved culturally.. .and are rooted in past practice or action" (291). He believes that moral motivation, or what he calls "the internal sanction" is unproblematical in Hume (298). Since we dwell in a moral cul? ture and our very self is a social and moral self, "moral knowledge leads to action...in a direct way without the interposition of addi? tional passions or interests" (291). He char? acterizes moral motivation as being as natural as is nonmoral motivation, and he denies?this denial strikes us as challenging an assumption many writers on Hume have brought with them?that nonmoral motiva? tion is primary and moral motivation some? how derivative (301). Accordingly he holds "the question can never arise in Hume's moral theory of whether I ought to be moral" (296). Capaldi goes so far as to say Hume is the only example in all modern moral philosophy "able to discuss intelligibly the relationship between moral insight and moral motivation without denying the exis? tence of either, without appeal to metaphys? ical mysteries" (303). Has Capaldi established his interpretation over against its rivals? Adequately to do so would require, we think, a different sort of study?this is after all chiefly a book of Hume's moral theory?a study which ex? plains how the texts on which fasten those who construe Hume as a skeptic figure into</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 267 the approach Capaldi takes. We would hope that a new work of this character would ad? dress the question of why, given that Hume is deemed a superb writer, his essayed revolu? tion in Philosophy did not succeed, so that even now the reading which Capaldi pres? ents is one, as he admits, to which the philo? sophical world is unreceptive. To conclude, what strikes us as the greatest merit of this book is Capaldi's presentation of Hume's informal or perhaps pre-theoreti? cal vision of morality. While many other writ? ers typically latch on to a specific problem in Hume's moral theory (particularly one that overlaps with an issue in contemporary phi? losophy), Capaldi exhibits to the reader how Hume felt about the moral dimension of life. When combined with an exposition on Hume's social and political thought, derived from the Essays and the History, what emerges is a rich and valuable antidote to the tendency of commentators to miss the over? all picture for the sake of questions of a nar? row, albeit philosophically stimulating, character. Hume's Theory of Justice (1981) is the sec? ond of the three volumes in which Jonathan Harrison presents his commentary on the third Book of the Treatise. Like Hume's Moral Epistemology (1976) this is a meticu? lous examination of the argument of the text, undertaken with a view to checking coher? ence, inference and evidence. But unlike the earlier book, this one is somewhat tedious and fails to highlight what in his political ver? sion Hume was attempting to accomplish. Harrison's book must of course be consulted by students of Part II?no one else has taken the time to examine the text so closely?but if the aim was to rescue Part II of Book III from its relative neglect, this study is not a success, and for all but the most specialized scholar, we would rather recommend Mackie and Flew (1986), and for the special? ized scholar, we would recommend Capaldi. Before closing we must take a moment to acknowledge three further instances of ex? cellent recent work on Hume. First, in Hume's Sentiments (1982) Peter Jones not only establishes Cicero as the guiding influ? ence on Hume's conception of morals but sets a new standard for anyone doing histor ical scholarship on Hume. Second, in the sev? eral essays featuring Hume's moral vision to be found in Postures of the Mind (1985) An? nette Baier, who in our opinion expands our understanding of nearly every text of Hume on which she writes, relates Hume to ques? tions in contemporary Anglo-American eth? ics better, we think, than any other Hume scholar. Finally, although it is unusual in a retrospective such as this to include an edito? rial accomplishment, a review of important Hume literature would be gravely incom? plete without crediting Eugene Miller for ed? iting and quite especially for his masterful provision of both textual and explicatory notes to the Liberty Classics edition of Es? says Moral, Political and Literary (1985). Is? sued in an impressive but affordable format, this volume makes the Essays accessible to both professional and first time students of Hume. Northern Illinois University Received December 7, 7990 III. Philosophy of Religion, Social and Political Philosophy and History It is perhaps indicative of the revival of interest in religion in contemporary culture that more articles appeared on Hume's phi? losophy of religion than on his social and po? litical philosophy: 85 articles in the former (mostly on miracles) to 51 articles in the lat? ter. On Hume as historian, there were only six articles. Restriction of space allows for mention only of the books published in these areas. David Hume's Anti-Theistic Views, by Timothy A. Mitchell (1986), is, at best, a sur? vey of all of Hume's arguments against the theistic world view. The summaries are brief and often wooden, paying little regard to what other commentators have had to say about controversial passages. The criticisms are even briefer and take no account of obvi? ous replies that could be made. Worse, there is no appreciation of the sense in which, though rejecting orthodoxy, Hume affirmed the theistic world view. Stanley Tweyman's Scepticism and Belief</page><page sequence="14">268 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1986) provides a closely argued commentary on Parts I-VIII and Part XII of the Dialogues. These are the parts which deal with the Argument from Design, the argument which purports to show that, by analogical reasoning, one can infer from ob? served resemblances between design in the world and machines of human contrivance that the cause of design in the world resem? bles human intelligence. The central prob? lem of the Dialogues is that Philo, who by Part VIII has employed a number of skepti? cal arguments which completely undermine the design argument, seems to reverse him? self in Part XII, holding not only the belief that the world is the product of a designer, but claiming that "all rules of just reasoning" force such a conclusion. Tweyman shows that there is no inconsistency in Philo's posi? tion and that it follows a dialectical pattern of thought which Hume laid out in section XII of the first Enquiry whereby the philoso? pher moves through dogmatism to Pyrrhon ian skepticism, to mitigated skepticism. The latter is the true form of criticism for fixing reasonable beliefs. Philo's affirmation of the reasonableness of belief in an intelligent de? signer of the universe is simply the teaching of mitigated skepticism on the question of the rationality of belief in theism. In making his case, Tweyman has interesting things to say about Hume's understanding of causal? ity, his use of the principle "like causes prove like effects," his understanding of the differ? ent forms and uses of skepticism, the proper method for philosophical criticism, and Hume's conception of "natural belief." The latter is especially important. The sort of crit? ical thinking which mitigated skepticism makes possible rests on the authority of nat? ural beliefs such as belief in causality, the external world, and the self. Tweyman ar? gues that belief in an intelligent maker of the universe is a natural belief on the same level as the three basic beliefs just mentioned. This has not seemed obvious to commenta? tors. In fact, it seems false. For a natural be? lief, in Hume's account, must be universal and unavoidable. Theism appears to be nei? ther. Tweyman makes a convincing case, however, that all four basic beliefs are on the same footing as natural beliefs. In doing so, he presents the deepest account yet of just what Hume means by a natural belief. Tweyman's book is of interest, therefore, not only for its commentary on the Dialogues, but also for the contribution it makes to our understanding of what Hume considers true philosophical criticism to be. Antony Flew has published an edition of the essay "Of Miracles" with an Introduction and Notes (1985). Flew seeks, in the Intro? duction, to defend and strengthen Hume's argument that it is impossible there should ever be evidence which would enable us to know that a miracle had occurred so as to be the foundation of a religion. The Introduc? tion is an elegant recasting of the larger dis cussion of Hume's argument in his commentary on the first Enquiry, Hume's Philosophy of Belief (1961), and adds noth? ing to the earlier discussion. Indeed, it car? ries over one of its defects, namely Flew's insistence that Hume provides no way of dis? tinguishing between accidental and lawlike regularities and that he denied that causes actually produce their effects as opposed to being merely conjoined to them. Since Flew's book appeared, a number of writers have suggested that there was a richer notion of lawlikeness and causal realism in Hume. But with the appearance of Galen Strawson's The Secret Connexion (1989), the matter has been put virtually beyond contro? versy. Michael Levine's Hume and the Problem of Miracles: A Solution (1989) is the most systematic examination of Hume's argument against miracles. Levine provides a careful reading of the argument in "Of Miracles," setting it in the wider context of Hume's the? ory of causation and inductive reasoning. There is rich reference to the secondary liter? ature on Hume and contemporary episte? mology, and a helpful discussion of the difference between Hume's argument and Tillotson's argument against the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which Hume claimed was the model for his own general argument against miracles. Hume's argu? ment (and many others) seeks to show that there is an incoherence in the very idea of a miracle, the reason being that a miracle is</page><page sequence="15">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 269 defined as a violation of a law of nature. Lev ine explores various senses of what can be meant by a law of nature, as well as what can be meant by a violation of a law, and con? cludes that, when an event is characterized as a miracle, whether it can be known to have occurred is on an epistemological par with the question of whether it occurred apart from its being characterized as a miracle. Miracles are epistemologically defective only if one knows independently that there are no supernatural agents capable of work? ing miracles. Levine concludes that miracles can be known to occur on the basis of both testimony and direct experience. In a helpful concluding chapter, he explores a number of contemporary theories of knowledge (Quine, Goldman, Chisholm, as well as those proposed by theistic philosophers such as Plantinga and Quinn) and argues that none of them yield considerations which rule out his thesis that miracles are epistemologically neutral. Francis Beckwith's David Hume's Argu? ment Against Miracles, A Critical Analysis (1989) is a well reasoned critique of Hume's argument against miracles and contempo? rary recastings of that argument by Antony Flew, Alastair McKinnon, and Patrick Nowell-Smith. Beckwith calls attention to the special role that agency plays in the con? cept of miracle and defends a version of the cosmological argument used by Arabic phi? losophers and by Bonaventure to establish belief in God as a personal agent. The notion of agency also underlies his argument that the legal model of reasoning is the proper one for determining whether a miracle has in fact occurred. Although a great deal of Hume's philoso? phy is devoted to social and political philoso? phy, and although The History of England is primarily a political history, there was no book on Hume's political thought until John Stewart's The Moral and Political Philoso? phy of David Hume (1963). This is a good general introduction to Hume's views, but it lacks critical depth. The next book was Dun? can Forbes' Hume's Philosophical Politics (1975), which is a very helpful work in the history of ideas, but more concerned with the origin of Hume's views and the character of his own political commitments than with as? sessing his political philosophy. We now have two excellent studies of Hume's political thought: David Miller's Philosophy and Ide? ology in Hume's Political Thought (1981) and Fredrick Whelan's Order and Artifice in Hume's Political Philosophy (1984). Miller provides a concise, readable, and sensible in? troduction to Hume's political philosophy. But he is also interested in the question of how Hume's political thought fits into the liberal, conservative political traditions, and the more general question (as applied to Hume) of how far philosophical theorizing determines one's actual political commit? ments. Mill, for instance, saw Hume as a re? actionary Tory and argued that such a position followed from his philosophical skepticism. Russell, however, who accepted Hume's skepticism but rejected his politics, argued that there was no connection be? tween the two. Miller argues for a middle position. Hume's philosophical skepticism was necessary but not sufficient in determin? ing his political conservatism. The remainder was supplied by what Miller calls "ideology." By this, he does not mean the "false con? sciousness" of Marx. One's ideology is sim? ply the sentiments and opinions absorbed, perhaps unknowingly, from one's political environment. The book is neatly divided into two parts. The first explicates Hume's "philosophy" as a skeptical-empirical theory of judgment. Judgment is based neither on reason nor on the experience of classical empiricism but on custom and the workings of the imagination. From this a political philosophy of custom arises which is neither rationalistic nor utili? tarian. The second part of the book examines Hume's "ideology," i.e., beliefs and senti? ments he had about the world in which he lived, what motivates men, the nature of so? ciety and economics, and the politics of his time. In a concluding chapter, Miller seeks to disentangle the "philosophy" from the "ide? ology." The philosophy of custom is con? cerned mainly to block certain forms of radical argument for change (rationalistic or utilitarian) rather than to recommend a po? litical order. Hume's ideology which affirms a ruling elite composed of a progressive</page><page sequence="16">270 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY landowning aristocracy derives from his identification with the reigning political order and is not necessitated by his political philosophy. It is difficult to describe Hume as either liberal or conservative since these are nineteenth-century terms prompted by the French Revolution. The landed aristocracy of eighteenth-century Britain was progres? sive, affirming both the virtues of continuity and respect for established authority (con? servative values) and the rule of law, a free market, and a social order of careers open to talent (liberal values). The French Revolu? tion artificially forced an ideological choice: conservatives rallied to defend the old re? gime in order to find a ground of order and continuity. Liberals defended the egalitarian and rationalistic values of the French Revo? lution and have ever since seen custom, tra? dition, and sentiment as their main enemy. Miller shows that the stock picture of Burke (conservative), Smith (liberal) with Hume in between is wrong. All three identified with a progressive landed and commercial aristoc? racy. Either may be viewed, retrospectively, as liberal or conservative depending on how the prism is tilted. The true legacy of Hume's conservatism is not in the romantic and reli? gious defense of the old regime, for Hume's skepticism and his hostility to religion made such defense impossible. But turning to con? servative politics, and especially .British poli? tics, the matter is different. Three elements of the modern conservative political tradi? tion are to be found in Hume's skeptical con? servatism: (1) that ideology is derived from one's surroundings and no attempt can or need be made to justify it; but such ideology can and will change imperceptibly over time; (2) that all rationalist schemes of change be rejected; and (3) that reforms when urgent should be enacted but without unduly dis? turbing existing institutions and habits of thought. Such "conservatives" will find in Hume's political philosophy a friend with which their political prejudices have long made them familiar. Whelan's Order and Artifice in Hume's Political Philosophy (1984) is a more system? atic and in-depth account of Hume's political philosophy and its relation to his epistemol? ogy and to his theory of human nature. Un like Miller's account, Whelan seeks to de? fend the cogency of Hume's political philos? ophy. Whelan argues that in many ways Hume's political thought is paradigmatic of the Anglo-American political tradition as opposed to the intellectual tradition. He goes out of his way to quarantine Hume's thought from the main currents of Anglo-American political theory which tends to be rationalis? tic and utilitarian. Hume is not a utilitarian, nor a methodological individualist; nor can rational choice theory, nor rights theory, nor Rawlsian fairness illustrate what he has to teach. There are two themes in Whelan's book: Hume's conception of social and polit? ical order as a realm of artifice and the rela tion of this conception to Hume's philosophical skepticism. Hume's "conser? vatism" is discussed not as an ideology but as a philosophically defensible view, the task of which is to make known and to explain the workings of artifice in human affairs, a di? mension necessarily distorted and obscured by the rationalistic and utilitarian theories that dominate contemporary political phi? losophizing. Christopher Berry's Hume, Hegel and Human Nature (1982) is one of those re? markable books one hoped would be written but did not expect to see. It is a systematic examination of the two thinker's theories of human nature and of the quite different vi? sion of culture, political order, and history which follows from them. The account ranges over all of Hume's writings and is a thorough canvass of Hume's remarks on human nature. Berry's thesis is that Hegel, following Herder, held that human nature is active and self-modifying and so capable of total change. Whereas, despite his keen sense of custom and change, Hume worked with the notion that human nature is time? less and unchanging. The question of what can be meant by "human nature" and what it can mean to say that it does or does not change cannot be raised here nor can justice be done to the rich account Berry provides. It is enough to say that this is a book that anyone interested in Hume's philosophy should read. For one thing the question of whether human nature is uniform is a lively one in contemporary debate (Rorty, Maclntyre,</page><page sequence="17">METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY / 271 etc.) and Hume's relation to the debate should be clearly understood. For another, it is important to see the striking similarities between Hume and Hegel, thinkers often viewed as incommensurable. Both begin with a critique of philosophy; both have a keen sense of historical change; both sought a rapprochement between philosophy and history. Berry's study provides a fresh look at Hume and opens up a new range of ques? tions to be explored. Nicholas Phillipson's David Hume (1989) is the best treatment of Hume's historical writing, the only other full-scale attempts being G. Giarrizzo's David Hume politico e storico (1962) and Duncan Forbes' Hume's Philosophical Politics (1975). In this ele? gantly written book, Phillipson explores the historical and political culture out of which the History of England arose and to which it was a response. He argues that Hume was one of the great historians of all time because of his vision that the history of civilization must begin and end with politics. It is the unique capacity of human beings to con? struct governments and to understand their utility that is the essence of civilization and the key to understanding man's capacity for justice, humanity, and wisdom. Hume had a keen sense of the historicity of historical writing. And it is for this reason, paradoxi? cally, that his history is both dated and time? less. No historian before or since, Phillipson argues, had so subtle and powerful an under? standing of the interests, material and ideo? logical, that shape the political behavior of men, and few have understood better the ever-changing character of the political pru dence that is needed to control it. Essential to understanding Hume as a historian is to understand him as an essayist, and Phillipson treats Hume as both. Hume's Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary have not been easily available in a critical edition, and the History, which passed through at least 167 posthumous editions, finally went out of print in 1894. Hap? pily both of these works are now available in inexpensive editions by Liberty Classics: the History in six volumes, ed. by William Todd (1983) and the Essays, ed. by Eugene Miller (1985). Phillipson's book is an excellent in? troduction to these neglected classics. Mention should be made of two other books that have an indirect bearing on Hume's social and political thought. John Richetti's Philosophical Writing: Locke, Berkeley, Hume (1983) is of little philosophi? cal value, but it is a useful study of the rheto? ric of Hume's writing. Jerome Christensen's Practicing Enlightenment: Hume and the Formation of a Literary Career (1987) is a textbook deconstruction of Hume as an En? lightenment thinker. This, like most works in deconstructive analysis tells us more about the partisan views of the author than about the subject of analysis. Christensen is tone deaf to Hume's social and political philoso? phy as an inquiry into truth and to his discov? ery of the historicity of political truth. He, consequently, fails to see how Hume's phi? losophy is, itself, a criticism of the Enlighten? ment. The book is a painfully obvious case of how deconstructive analysis in its eager pur? suit of emancipation from the Enlighten? ment often turns out to be the inverted mirror image of it.
