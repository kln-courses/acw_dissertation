<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELIZABETH LEGGE Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" THE "YBA" (YOUNG BRITISH ARTIST) CAME to international atten- tion in the early 1990s with a combination of elaborate construction, lame jokes, and apathetic shock: from Damien Hirst's shark in a vitrine of formaldehyde to Jake and Dinos Chapman's vast staging of a concentration camp using tiny ready- made model kit figures.' To avoid hegemonizing or homogenizing, critics have used alternative acronyms: "nBa" (new) and "rBa" (recent).2 Who exactly is a yBa is also flexibly defined, although a roster was proposed by Sensation, the 1997 Royal Academy exhibition of the collection of the advertising executive Charles Saatchi, who functions as the demiurge of this contested avant-garde. The agitation sur- rounding Sensation, both in London and again, in 1999, in New York at the Brook- lyn Museum, was the yBa's symptomatic apotheosis. The scandal of the London Sensation was Marcus Harvey's portrait of a notori- ous murderer of children, Myra Hindley (fig. 1). Based on a thirty-year-old newspa- per photograph, Harvey's painting comments on the media iconization of the ce- lebrity criminal (recapitulated by the publicity surrounding it during Sensation). The painting is a bald quote of Chuck Close's blandly uncanny giant portraits, but, with vicious effectiveness, Harvey transforms Close's painterly tesserae (sometimes composed of fingerprints) into a template of a child's handprints. Myra (1995) is an affront not only to media sensationalism but also to U.S. art as international model. Harvey's Myra also comments on contemporary nostalgia for the pop 1960s and for the punk 1970s ("God Save Myra Hindley" T-shirts), on crime scene art (Abigail Lane's "bloody handprints"), and on media obsession with another serial murderer, Rosemary West.3 During the autumn of 1997, however, the painting was necessarily received in the context of media inundation of photographs of the re- cently deceased Princess of Wales.4 Harvey's portrait functioned as a short-haired blonde demonic double of Diana-the-good-mother (fig. 2). This context confused Harvey's ironic message about celebrity and tragedy, a confusion intensified by the fact that the generic incomprehending "philistine," the staple foil for all avant- REPRESENTATIONS 71 * Summer 2000 (C THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ISSN 0734-6018 pages 1-23.

Billboard. garde outrage, who picketed the Royal Academy was the grieving mother of one of Hindley's victims. Myra, as quintessential avant-garde shock, was rapidly recycled into advertis- ing. A drug abuse charity, making explicit a moral agenda, had a poster made of children's handprints.5 Adidas simply produced billboards with the monochrome face of a boxer made up of little running shoes (fig. 3). While there is a comic logic to Damien Hirst's formaldehyde work being used to advertise Absolut vodka, or to Tracey Emin's advertising Sapphire Gin (Emin's autobiographic work includes accounts of heavy drinking), the displacement of Myra tesserae into advertising bill- boards conveys an ambiguous message. Harvey's painting, intended to politicize the autonomous neutrality of Close's art, in effect laundered the newspaper mug shot of Hindley, allowing it to be put to commercial use. The grays of Harvey's image have a metaphoric tinge: they occupy almost any cultural gray area. The highly publicized Sensation exhibition has aggravated the sometimes disin- genuous agonizing about the legitimacy and nature of yBa art, the picking of scabs off the various claims for both the degeneration and regeneration that the art might be made to represent.6 A resume of objections include that the art is derivative, that it looks avant-garde but isn't oppositional, that it fails to address individual artists or works, and that it is a shallow, media-driven phenomenon playing into certain stereotypes of Britishness.7 It could be argued that objections, from left and right, are Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art"</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 4.

The yBa functions as a space in which failures and limitations of international contemporary art may be identified and temporarily stored, at least until some un- specified sell-by date. One primary concern voiced by their critics is the question of whether the yBas merely opportunistically simulate lost avant-garde engagement, adopting a media- friendly "look" of being shocking in the tradition of the angry young man, the work- ing class hero, and the punk.8 The yBas' enhancing of stereotypes of avant-gardism can be seen as working-classism, a reassertion of punk's working-class as class war.9 Patricia Bickers, the editor of Art Monthly, ajournal that has led the skeptical debate about yBas, has deplored the marketing of "class," and of the vulgarized yBa as caricatural "chirpy cockney type."'0l Examples might include the "plucky," "feisty" Tracey Emin, who makes art of her eventful life and whose persona is designed in the eccentric tradition of Stevie Smith: "That's not her drowning, but waving. Let's wave back!"" Richard Billingham's photographs have been made to evoke not so much family life as the "spiritedness" of the working class (fig. 4). 12 Rachel White- 4 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">read's plaster cast interior of a demolished house must stand for the East End's "tenacious hanging on" during the Blitz.'3 If a middle-class paradigm of a "lost inheritance of struggle" can be nostalgi- cally projected onto working-class youth, it can be equally wishfully projected onto artists.'4 Working-classness, egalitarian but not anticapitalist, is highly exportable. The New rork Times account of Sensation, "Art That Tweaks British Propriety," quoted the London Times: "The rebels have stormed the bastion of conserva- tism."'5 This could be a synopsis of Richard Flood's essay from the 1995 Brilliant! catalog, which set the terms for U.S. marketing of yBas as a cartoonish class war. While class may be deployed ironically by some yBas (Damien Hirst's, Sarah Lu- cas's and Tracey Emin's "yobbishness"; Sam Taylor-Wood's gentrification), it is a unique selling feature, as it has always been for British exports to Masterpiece Theatre.16 Recognition by the international art world paradoxically increases the pressure to differentiate oneself, and one marketing recourse for artists and critics is to ste- reotypes of "Britishness."'7 The yBa relationship to U.S. art can be seen as an am- biguous, strategic, postcolonialism: the culturally marginalized Britain remarkets itself as just another postcolonial culture, playing, ironically, to the approval of the stereotypically economically dominant U.S. imperial center."8 While acknowledg- ing the difficulty of situating British art within international art, Bickers has de- plored the use of stereotypes to break that impasse.'9 An example of someone caught in this predicament is the astute Michael Corris, who, writing in the U.S. journal Ar~forum, argues for a particular British identity for this art but, in doing so, sets out generalizations: "British, Young, Invisible, w/Attitude."20 Significantly, "attitude," used here to define an essential yBa identity, is in fact U.S. idiom (made famous by Madonna and the rap supergroup "Niggers with Attitude"). Moreover, Bickers deplores the tendency to see or market oneself "as others see us." Jake and Dinos Chapman, having been advised that their child mannequin Fuckfaces would not be exhibitable in the United States, made their version of a suitable export- an image of Stephen Hawking (fig. 5).21 Their Hawking, Ubermensch (1995), hyper- bolizes the stag of Edwin Henry Landseer's Monarch of the Glen (and its mild 1 960s British pop treatments by Peter Blake and Bryan Organ), conjuring up stereotypes of British tenacity, eccentricity, and intellectual superiority. These stereotypes are deployed in the diffuse context of "postmodern" theory. British art colleges of the 1980s famously turned out artists inculcated with concepts of the simulacral, excess, constructed identity, and postcolonialism and with critiques of authorship, representation, and art institutions. In this theoretical domain, the ironic deployment of stereotypes by yBa artists and critics (the Chap- mans' Hawking) meets crude stereotyping (the presumably reassuring bobbies, guardsmen, darts, and Beatle music at the Brilliant! opening) and tactical stereotyp- ing (the litanies of national attributes by erudite British critics) for marketing pur- Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" 5</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 5.

Ai poses, to produce a recognizable voice both for the art and its criticism.22 The title of the 1991 TechniqueAnglaise catalog, a foundational examination of the new British art and its international recognition, was flippant, a French phrase for English pub- lic school homosexuality, as if recognition could only take the form of a class-bound, stereotypical, foreign view.23 Arguably, postmodern theory has itself become institutionalized and can be read as such offthe surfaces ofyBa art.24 Is theory, then, a paradoxically instrumen- tal, shallow-making, and formulaic component of the art, rather than a truly corro- sive critique?25 Does theory provoke the playfully pernicious hybridity envisioned by Homi Bhabha, or, as Aijaz Ahmad has more skeptically argued, does it instead become a "marketplace of ideas" in which to shop?26 In any event, the stereotypes of yBa idiom are theoretically deployed, with the understanding that they may backfire, and they are at the heart of what might constitute yBa meanings. Self-presentation in stereotypes derives from British crises of identity after the "loss of Empire": seeing one's disempowered self in the way that one has seen the colonized other. In this historical context, the theorizing of the postcolonial is a marker of the theoretically informed yBa.27 Echoes of the famous colonial "mimic men," emulating dominant imperial culture with some mitigating irony, may be detected in Bickers's suggestion that the yBas enjoy a degree of license denied to U.S. artists in the prevailing culture of political correctness.28 (American political REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">'e-.- TW,.

The Brooklyn Museum's recent public- ity for Sensation in the form of a "health warning" bears out this idea of special British license: "The contents of this exhibition may cause shock, vomiting, confu- sion, panic, euphoria and anxiety." The yBas are lords of misrule, yet they offer a degree of absolute skepticism to this hypothesized earnest U.S. engagement. In Gavin Turk's Pop (1993), British working-class rebellion as staged by punk is en- acted as a self-portrait of Turk as the Sex Pistol Sid Vicious as Andy Warhol's ver- sion of the corny movie Elvis as anodyne cowboy as theorized by Greil Marcus (fig. 6).29 Similarly, Marc Quinn's silvery Morphologies refer to U.S. popular culture in the form ofJeffKoons's chromed kitsch as if absorbed by the shape-shifting robot in Terminator 2 (fig. 7).3? It may be that the price of admission to the U.S. market is a combination of flattering mimicry and mockingly licentious marginality. All these stereotypes lead to the larger, more highly marketable stereotype: that of Britain's lost identity, shored up only by stereotypes. Since the Second World War, Britain has been perceived as a weak economic power, attractive only for tour- ism; or, as the filmmaker DerekJarman and novelistJulian Barnes have caricatured it, a mere simulation of its own history and monuments, a theme-park.3' In an Art- forum piece on new British art, David Frankel provides a list of national symbols (rationing, Wimpy's, Bird's custard, Butlins) as a counterpart to Prime Minister John Major's often-mocked 1993 list (the county ground, warm beer, old maids Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" 7</page><page sequence="8">FIGURE 7.

Q;S-a cycling to communion).32 The yBas have also been implicated in the traffic in out- moded stereotypes of Britishness from earlier "Swinging London," the pop '60s, and the punk '70s.33 The stereotypical British identity crisis derives from "loss of Empire" and Brit- ain's relegation to the status of regional power, along with postwar economic de- cline. Economic decline is further shaded as physical decline and demoralization: the "British disease," the "sick man of Europe," a "postwar funk" to be rectified by Thatcherite "enterprise culture."34 British postwar art may also be seen in terms of the political positioning of Britain within the Cold War and the delusional British belief that it would be a broker between the United States and Iron Curtain coun- tries (a recurrent theme in John Le Carre's spy novels).35 The rhetoric of decline goes hand in hand with the rhetoric of postimperial guilt: a "histrionic self-pity in comparing [Britain's] deindustrialization and decline as a world power to the Third World."36 This demoralization has even been impli- cated in the theorization of postmodernism, whose "fatal and fatalistic" rhetoric is fulfilled in the condition of Britain.37 If yBa art plays into stereotypes of an ex- hausted Britain of uncertain identity, it does so with the knowledge that being ex- hausted is a theoretically versatile option; perhaps, given the skepticism of all na- tional rhetorics, the only option. It is explained to Arforum readers that the new "crude energy" of British art emerges from a "mood of helplessness and apathy in a culture struggling to come to terms with its colonialist and neocolonialist past. "38 This scenario has its seductions: the rotten core may be sweet, as Michael Bracewell and Julian Evans suggest in the parodic artists' tabloid, The Mule: "Like Brighton Rock, the novel or the British seaside confectionery, rottenness runs through the nation, a rottenness, according to the pundits, with any number of causes."39 Stereotypes, as useful, agreed-upon misunderstandings that set up the commu- nicative economy, function as shorthand versions of identity and power and have been fostered by government programs aimed at promoting culture, both in its REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">"heritage" and contemporary forms.40 New Labour has recently retooled some of the more marketable stereotypes; for example, in 1997 M. and C. Saatchi rede- signed the British Tourist Authority logo: now the component crosses of its Union Jack are separated ribbons floating above areas of green, gold, and black (the colors of the Jamaican flag). This is curiously akin to Mark Wallinger's reworking of the Union Jack in the colors of the Irish flag, Oxymoron (1996), which he made for an exhibition that dealt precisely with national identity in multicultural Britain.4" Brit- ish Airways, another Saatchi client, has controversially jettisoned the Union Jack, presumably regarded as the tatters of Empire, in favor of more international, folk- artish emblemata.42 The marketing of Britain in a time of policy timidity ("new" Labour) through images generated by designers and advertisers draws attention to the affiliation of advertising and cultural identity. That this identity tries to take into account, however cautiously, the presence of the former Empire within the multiracial and multicultural new Britain again directs us to the presence ofpostco- lonial theory. A cliched aspect of the British identity crisis involves self-definition in opposi- tion to the United States, characterized as trashy, consumerist, and complicit in the breakdown between art and advertising.43 Recently, Tony Blair's staging of the Princess of Wales's funeral was disparaged as an Americanized "politics of the emo- tions," "inauthentic display," and "devalued currency of feeling."44 In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher's declarations of the "special relationship" between the United States and Britain, combined with the sale of British industries to U.S. conglomer- ates, aggravated British debate.45 Parliamentary exchanges after the U.S. air raid on Libya in 1986 raised themes of both British impotence and the relative crudity of U.S. power.46 Informing this perception is a fantasy in which "Britain is Greece to America's Rome, providing finesse and intelligence to tame and direct Amer- ica's force."47 This notion that the British can provide intellectual refinement is, in turn, furthered by American cultural representations: Obi Wan Kenobi to Luke Skywalker.48 These relative formulations of identity play out, paradoxically, in the very cru- dities of yBa quotation, or parody, of U.S. art, particularly of minimalism. The peculiar potential of minimalism for declaring its own austere classiness has long been teasingly reduced to packaging for consumer goods, by U.S. artists from War- hol to Koons. In a British context, however, minimalism was established through exhibitions at private dealers (Lisson Gallery, White Cube, Saatchi), and public institutions (the Tate Gallery) and could be made to stand for the colonial status of a Britain that imported its standards of modernity from the United States.49 If the minimalist effect of glass and metal in yBa art seems shallowly "notational," then it is because it is meant to be.50 The yBa variation is made to seem inadequate to its task, in a kind of underengineered sublime in such works as John Frankland's wall of faked elevator doors, Hirst's seedy shark suspended by visible wires that undermine the illusion of floating, Quinn's cryogenic refrigeration units, White- Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" 9</page><page sequence="10">FIGURE 8.

For his big New York show in 1996, Hirst turned a Robert Morris minimalist piece, well-known from reproduction in Gregory Battcock's MinimalArt, into a giant ashtray (figs. 8 and 9). If Hirst reinvents Koons's 1 980s basketballs in vitrines (which had in turn reinvented a 1966 floating- ball piece by Hans Haacke), Hirst's is more literally lightweight-a ping pong or beach ball.53 The question is whether this work constitutes a blow against the domi- nation of U.S. art, or whether it is, conversely, merely an opportunistic adoption of American sheen. It may have to be the latter in order to achieve the former. It has been argued that yBa quotations of U.S. minimalism result in a "scream- 10 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">ing for attention from within structures that [warrant] none,"54 but, ironically, this argument just reposes certain of Clement Greenberg's and Michael Fried's original objections to minimalism's theatricality, anthropomorphism, and literalness. Orig- inality and derivation in art and criticism are difficult to call.55 Recognizing this inescapable bind, the artist Matthew Arnatt has bathetically restated the U.S. mini- malist Donald Judd's famous comment that "a work needs only to be interesting" as: "I don't think it's necessary to think of art, art works, or shows, working in any interesting way."56 Nevertheless, this British literalizing and inhabiting of minimalism has been construed as lack of originality rather than as fine or useful ironies. If the left de- plores the ineffectual pose of this work as not being up to the task of critique, conser- vative critics may also deplore it as a defeatist exercise in shoddily made goods that "implicate[s] decay as an English pastime."57 In a Times Literary Supplement (TLS) "End of Britain Issue," a former Thatcher minister, George Walden, laments yBa art as "provincial, derivative, and residual: pallid or garish echoes of genuinely ex- citing and innovative movements" elsewhere (fig. 10).58 On that TLS cover, Scots celebrating devolution are juxtaposed with Damien Hirst's name, which functions, here and elsewhere, as a comic metonym of political disintegration (fig. 11). (In the Independent, in 1995, John Major was caricatured as a Hirstian animal in formalde- hyde, with the caption, "Oh God! It's disintegrating!")59 That sense of a literal, half-hearted, and second-rate synthesis of international art embodying decline may be this art's point and strategy for success. In fact, one new British Council poster for international distribution features a painting of a horse by George Stubbs fading into Hirst's pickled sheep, Awa)from the Flock, here used as a symbol of British innovation.60 A further problem in the notion of British lack of originality is that devaluation through reference to minimal art was already present in U.S. art of the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art's 1986 Endgame catalog.6 In TechniqueAnglaise it was argued that "a lot of American work from the '80s suddenly feels a little like Donald Trump stuff" and that British art had taken a perverse conceptual turn precisely to situate itself in opposition to the "big plate paintings" prevailing in the United States.62 (These claims suggest the stereotype of British intellectual austerity against vulgar foreign gestures.) The yBa phenomenon actually emerged not only as an antidote to Julian Schnabel's "big plate paintings," but also as a variation on the well-theorized, equally American, "endgame" art. Endgame's concerns with the simulacrum and with the artwork's collapse into fetish or commodity in the dead- pan work of Haim Steinbach, Koons, and Peter Halley was reinforced in Britain by the Saatchi Gallery's N'ew r1ork exhibition, which included these artists.63 In the Endgame catalog, Thomas Crow observed that art, stripped of its larger tasks of representation in the social world, survives by "being weak." This playing at being weak has been taken up strategically by a generation of British artists who adapt it to international relations.

The original Melanesian cargo cultists concluded that it was necessary to behave like the U.S. troops-to build simulated runways and radio towers-in or- der to obtain the same airlifted commodities.

If critical theory, supported by references to U.S. minimal and "endgame" art, is a kind of exoskeleton to yBa art, it has also functioned as viscera, through abjec- 12 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 11.

Eliot's Hollow Men from fake buttocks (a nice incorporation of Anglo-American heritage culture).66 The relation of this British art to its U.S. counterparts is deliberately that of a pantomime horse to a method actor.67 (The horse, a stock character in traditional British pantomime, is played by two actors, one in the front and one in the back of a woolly costume.)

Courtesy of the artist. The embrace of abjection is a strategy intertwined with the self-presentation of British art within the international. In the United States, the notion of abjection has lent itself to a political rhetoric of marginalized groups and also serves repre- sentations of the postcolonial, a marking of one's group as liminal, transitional, and Third World against both U.S. economic power and European political unity.68 Boundaries and identities within Britain are also unstable at a time when Scotland and Wales are devolving-or, alternatively, when England is "abjecting" its Celtic parts.69 If British art's strategic weakness and abjection may be seen as an identification with a diminished postcolonial status, it must be observed that postcolonialism itself has become an "object of desire for critical practice."70 The postcolonial discourse that appears to inform certain yBa strategies and criticism is allied to Homi Bhab- ha's formulation, in which new alterities and minorities within the former imperial center are addressed.7' While not political in the sense of "mutually reinforcing oppositions," this "multiplicity of voices" raises issues of marginalization and, more important, of stereotypes of national and gender identity. The question of why the yBas are considered as a group and not as individual artists also may be in some 14 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">FIGURE 13. Sol LeWitt, Series A, 1967.

Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari have ar- gued that a minor literature is characterized by its collectivity, with "no individual masters." This scarcity of talent paradoxically works to the advantage of individuals as each author's statement necessarily becomes part of a larger, more recognizable collective enunciation.72 Bernice Murphy, curator of the Sydney yBa exhibition, Pictura Britannica, work- ing through the complexities of a nation-based exhibition that tries to avoid regres- sive notions of national identity, cited Homi Bhabha and the cultural analyst Stuart Hall under the subheading, "Plural Identities, Decentred Subjectivities": "Artists are also moulded in sites other than cities-sites that include potent mental spaces, that are acculturated and historicized through diverse processes of... memory and socially mutating experience."73 It must be noted that these artists' mental spaces not only involve the collisions of diverse cultural backgrounds, British stereotypes, and American and international art but also include the very theorizing of culture exemplified by Hall and Bhabha.74 Artists' knowing use of retheorized postcolonial discourse is in some respects allied to government rethinking of Britain's identity and role. This multiply posi- Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" 15</page><page sequence="16">tioned postcolonial attitude can also be situated within "post-Fordist" economics, the shift to part-time, decentralized patterns of designer-originated production and consumption what Robin Murray has called (with attention both to consumerism and the opportunistic multiculturalism of advertisers) "Benetton Britain."75 This alliance of cultural identity and post-Fordism is evident in the influential Demos report, BritainTM: Renewing Our Identity, produced in September 1997 at the time of the Sensation exhibition. Here, Britishness means being a "hub" where goods, messages, and ideas are exchanged and a "bridge" between Europe and America a reworking of the postwar vision of Britain-as-broker. This redefined, ethnically diverse Britain markets creativity in science, pop music, fashion design, and yBas.76 If Empire can no longer empower Britain's cultural constructs, then the market can. The operations of theory within the work of artists and critics allows for a theo- rized self-marginalization, including identifications with the situations of various minorities, whether or not the artist is actually a woman, gay, black, worker, immi- grant, and so on.77 Sarah Lucas plays a tough boy, while Sam Taylor-Wood vamps in a T-shirt with the slogan of a politicized gay group devoted to outing eminent closet gays: "Fuck, Suck, Spank, Wank."78 Jake Chapman argues that "fractured, unreliable, irresponsible" work reflects the status of British artistic culture: "It's al- ways already marginalised. It already has the essence of being a subculture. It al- ready conceives of itself as having no power.' 79 This rhetoric of marginality echoes Phil Cohen's description of youth cultures as a play of representations and identities that have no truly oppositional ground. "Youth" is "simultaneously constituted as a place and time of marginality and pow- erlessness, and as a whole series of special symbolic powers."80 In this construct, the animalistic adolescent is characterized in the same way as "primitive" colonial populations or the domestic working-class.8' Thus invented, youth is both market- able and market. This construction of youth is analogous to the construction of the yBa: "a whole group of deliciously young and savage artists who all know each other, live near each other, and even dot-dot-dot-dot each other."82 As does "youth" as a postcolonial construct, yBas let the old imperial center retain its intellectual prestige but simultaneously let it shop among identity formations of various minorities- after all, its Empire is now within and let it play through the markets as a range of fragmentary stereotypes of what constitutes avant-garde affront, including British working-classism.83 The editors of Occupational Hazard assert a "notoriously parochial and en- closed" British art world.84 In doing so, they echo a postcolonial voice's insisting that no one else may speak for it. This is allied to Bickers's refusal of any artistic or critical endeavor complicit with the dominant culture's stereotypes. While local patterns of influence and mutual conductivity are important and subtle, the insis- tence on a closed art world not only protects against crude outside misperceptions but also enhances the hyped mystique. Simon Ford's devastating, axiomatic, demy- thologizing critique of the yBas-as-phenomenon has in turn become a foundational 16 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">part of yBa mythology. The key players named by Ford (Tate Patrons of New Art, Charles Saatchi, the dealers JayJopling and Larry Gagosian, Goldsmiths' College teacher Michael Craig-Martin) are in turn grist for publicity. Ford's piece is contam- inated by fashion magazine articles offering "insider" views of the "scene."85 It could be that the confrontation of the Marxist oppositional model with post- modern multiplicity, and the further rhetoric of decline that surrounds that im- passe, themselves constitute the only possible critical positions.86 The Bank collec- tive, which functions as a kind of superego to the London art scene, summarizes the situation by lamenting the "bankruptcy of the binary" and the concomitant "general flattening of all art practice into a limited non-variety of recognizable house styles, each equally facile."87 Certainly some kind of in-between position is inevitable. Britain, reconfigured as postcolonial, must situate itself complexly within and against both U.S. cultural and market supremacy and the new euro Europe. While the turn toward Europe offers a way of countering U.S. domination, it also threatens old orders of class and national place of origin within Britain. If a colonialist master discourse requires a degenerate native population to jus- tify its rule, here it is taken on by the mythic yBa as "yob." The yBa allows Britain safely to frame, for domestic consumption and for export, what might be critique. This framing is enacted by taking up the well-theorized position of British decline as countered by new multicultural identifications and then by entering into the Americanized French critical discourse by parodic emulation of U.S. art. Within and without Britain, it involves entering the world of postcolonial mimicry and imitation. Just as Thatcherism was parodic (and, it was argued, ineffectively trans- planted) Reaganomics, so the yBas can take up the endgame for their own powerful postimperial ends.88 As Julian Barnes's Thatcherite entrepreneur observes: There are some people out there ... who think it's our job, our particular geopolitical func- tion, to act as an emblem of decline, a moral and economic scarecrow. Like, we taught the world how to play cricket and now it's our duty, an expression of our lingering imperial guilt, to sit back and let everyone beat us at it.89 In a useful strategy, this mortified postimperial condition has been allied by British artists and critics to identification with the postcolonial condition (and does take the form of appearing to let others beat you at games). To this end, Bank ironi- cally articulates the necessity of redefining the terms of competition: " America is indisputably not very high up in the league table of all-time world powers,' said an expert today. 'Italy comes out top, with the Roman Empire and the Renaissance; then you've got France and Great Britain in fourth and seventh position. America are 11 th behind Portugal.' "90 The hyped outrage surrounding Sensation in New York, centered on Chris Ofili's Holy Virgin made with elephant dung, might be taken as a coda. On one level, Mayor Giuliani's objections to the exhibit on religious grounds might be seen as a red herring (akin to the role of the protesting mother of one of Hindley's victims Reinventing Derivation: Roles, Stereotypes, and "Young British Art" 17</page><page sequence="18">at the London Sensation) that distracts from critical responses. In fact, art-critical responses have been inflected by Giuliani's assault: Peter Schjeldahl, who had been witty about Damien Hirst's "wild-assed" efforts at ingratiating himself in New York in 1996, more gravely defends the Hirst of Sensation as "some sort of great artist."'" In another way, the shock of Sensation in New York is a culture shock, an incarnation of the confusion attendant upon the crossing of cultural barriers, however ironically or consciously undertaken. The gray ornamental boss of dried elephant dung, which, until now, had been remarkable for its innocuousness, an ironic symbol of Ofili's African heritage (as if he had been staging himself as a kind of postcolonial hip-hop "Jongleur de Notre Dame") becomes, in New York, a "smear" on the painting and against Catholicism. In these gray areas, Giuliani has been able to situate his own war on the New York City "elite": the "guys who have the pulpits at the big mainstream Protestant churches ... folks who work at the Ford Founda- tion . . . people who take it for granted that Giuliani is being a total philistine," along with the Brooklyn Museum Board, and the yBas themselves.92 This politi- cally motivated and media intensified response is the most gratifying measure of there being an effectiveness of yBa strategies: in the postcolonial game, playing by British rules, it is only possible to score an "own goal."
