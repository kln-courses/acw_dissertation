Benson Biomechanics Department Highway Safety Research Institute The University of Michigan THE EVALUATION OF RESTRAINT systems performance depends to a large extent on the ability to faithfully reproduce human kinematic responses during tests using anthropomorphic test devices and computer models. Cadavers have also been used as surrogates in crash tests, but data on their kinematic responses is less than complete. In order to provide a wider data base for comparing the various surrogates, a research program was carried out to experimentally generate whole -body response (WBR) dynamics of cadavers and, under similar conditions, of anthropomorphic test de- vices. Interest was focused on the accurate measurement of 3-D head motion and chest and pelvis accelerations as the most representative responses. This paper describes the tests and summarizes the findings. METHODOLOGY TRANSDUCER MOUNTING Uniaxial accelerometers were rigidly attached in triaxial clusters to the skull and thoracic spine and in a biaxial cluster to the pelvic complex of each cadaver. During the development phase of each surgery technique, and during its actual application, primary consideration was given to three basic requirements: 1) simplicity and speed of surgery and hardware mounting, 2) strength and rigidity of the mount-bone structure and 3) re- peatability of locating transducer from one cadaver to another0 Other considerations were also given to avoiding significant alterations of the whole-body mechanical properties, clearances between seat and hardware during the test, ability to precisely determine locations and orientations of transducers relative to standard anatomical reference frames and facility of transducer removal after the test is completed. Three sites on the skull are selected so that they provide maximum separation between the three triaxial accelerometers. Scalp sections are locally removed, exposing the skull which is then cleaned and dried. For each mount, 3 pilot ABSTRACT The general objective of the Whole -Body Response (WBR) research program was to generate data on the kinematics and response of human surrogates in a realistic automobile impact environment. The program used a test configuration consisting of an idealized hard seat representation of a car seat with a three-point harness restraint system. Three different severity levels of crash test conditions were used. The human surrogates tested in this program were fifteen male cadavers*, a Hybrid n (Part 572) Anthropomorphic Test Device and a Hybrid III ATD recently developed by General Motors. In addition, mathematical simulations of the response and kinematics of a 50th percentile male occupant were performed at the three levels of crash severity, using the MVMA Two- Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator. The primary utility of the data generated by this program is for comparing the similarities and differences in response and kinematics of the various types of human surrogates and in pointing out areas that need improvement in both anthropomorphic test devices and mathematical models. *The protocol for the use of cadavers in this study was reviewed by the Committee to Review Grants for Clinical Research and Investigation Involving Human Beings of The University of Michigan Medical Center and follows guide- lines established by the U. S.

A steel wire is wrapped around the three partially- exposed screws forming a triangular area where the mount is placed and secured to the wire and screws with dental acrylic. The acrylic is allowed to harden before removing the special alignment jig, leaving the three mounts rigidly attached to the skull in an orthogonal formation. The HSRI method of attaching hardware to the vertebral column (the seventh thoracic vertebrae, T-7, in this case) is to secure a U-shaped aluminum mount over the spinous process with a long screw through and along the process into the body of the vertebra. To add rigidity and reinforcement, dental acrylic is used to pot the U-shaped mount over the spinous process. To attach the pelvic mount, which consists of a long machined aluminum bar, two incisions are made down to the superior -posterior pel vie crests, a pilot hole drillled in each crest in the A-P direction, and a long screw threaded in until flush with the skin. The heads of these two screws form a strong support for the aluminum bar, which is attached to the screw heads with smaller screws. The pelvic biaxial accelerometer is then mounted at the center of the bar. DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING The sampling rate used in the WBR program was 1600 Hz to allow the exact mathematical reconstruction of all frequencies below 800 Hz. It was judged that no frequencies higher than the 800-Hz Nyquist rate are of interest as far as the types of measurements being made are concerned. In order to eliminate any aliasing errors in the digitized signals, the analog signals were band- limited to the Nyquist band (0-800 Hz) by using active linear-phase (Bessel) analog filters as anti-aliasing filters, so that all frequencies above the Nyquist rate were attenuated by at least 24 dB. The digitized signals were subsequently filtered using low-pass finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters designed to have 0. 05 dB ripple in the passband and 100 dB attenuation in the stopband. Head acceleration signals were filtered with an FIR filter having a passband below 570 Hz (-3 dB at 600 Hz) and a stopband above 725 Hz. Chest and pelvis accelerations and belt loads were filtered with an FIR filter having a passband below 285 Hz (-3 dB at 316 Hz) and a stopband above 414 Hz. All signals were stored on digital magnetic tape for subsequent data analyses. 3-D ACCELEROMETRY Three-dimensional rigid-body motion measurement of the head dominated the analytical efforts in this research program. At the onset of the program (1973), it was believed that six accelerometer s were necessary and sufficient for complete description of the six degrees of freedom of the motion. Subsequent work at HSRI [1]* and elsewhere [2] showed that the mathematical formulation using only six acceleration readings is numerically unstable, and cannot be reliably used for complete 3-D motion determination. The use of redundant acceler omete rs was therefore necessary to maintain the stability of the numerical integration procedure. Several configurations were suggested, including the HSRI 3-3-3 and the Wayne State 3-2-2-2 ones. Since experimental procedures were already developed at HSRI for mounting a 2-2-2 con- figuration of six accelerometers, the choice of the new 3-3-3 configuration was a natural one, and required the addition of only one more accelerometer at each of the three locations. The method has been used in measurement of head motion response to direct impacts [3,4]. Other analytical methods developed and applied during this program include a 3-D radiographic measurement method for quantitatively locating implanted transducers relative to standard anatomical reference frames and an improved algorithm for computing the Head Injury Criterion, HIC. All analytical and experimental techniques employed during this program are fully documented in Appendix A of [6]. DESCRIPTION OF TESTS TEST CONDITIONS The test environment at the onset of impact is described in terms of seating configuration, restraint system, direction and severity of impact and the type of surrogate used as test subject. In all of the WBR testing program, the sub- ject was seated for frontal impact in a test fixture (buck) which is an idealized hard seat representation of a car seat. The subject was positioned as close as possible to a "natural" seating position of a typical car driver (Fig. 1). The restraint system used was a three-point belt system in a driver1 s side configuration and instrumented with load transducers to monitor the upper and lower forces in the shoulder harness, and the left and right forces in the lap *References in [ ] are listed at the end of the paper. 3235</page><page sequence="3">3236 N.

The sled deceleration profiles were selected to provide three levels of crash severities: a low-severity level corresponding to 25 km/h velocity change and 10 G average deceleration, an intermediate -se ve rity level with 32 km/h and 10 G, and a high- se ve rity level with 50 km/h and 20 G characteristics. All sled deceleration profiles were approximately "square" as shown in Fig. 2. CADAVER SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION The cadavers were obtained through the Gross Anatomy Program of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Michigan Medical School. Fifteen male cadavers, designated WBR-1 through WBR-15, were selected as human surrogates for testing in this research program, all approximating the 50th percentile in size. All but two were unembalmed, since embalming has been established to alter the mechanical properties of both soft tissue and bone. Surgery was performed for the purpose Fig. 1 - Seating configuration of subject for a Whole-Body Response sled test of mounting the instrumentation necessary for monitoring the 3-D motion of the head, the accelerations of the thorax and pelvis, and for photographic coverage of the motions of the head, shoulders, torso and legs. Locations of thorax and pelvis accelerometers were selected to correspond closely to those locations used in test dummies. Detailed anthropometric measurements were taken before surgery. In addition, a complete x-ray record was made of each cadaver skeletal structure, both in a lateral seated view that simulates the test configuration and in a prone frontal view after surgery has been completed. Seventy-five separate anthropometric measurements were taken on each cadaver. These measurements are essential to data analysts for interpretation of the results, and provide mathematical modelers with the necessary data for computer simulation of individual tests. As an indication of the physical characteristics of the sample of cadavers, Table 1 presents selected measure- ments and their statistical variations. During the first two years of the WBR program each cadaver was subjected to two sled tests, one at the intermediate crash severity level, followed by a second one at the high level. It was consistently observed that the tested cadavers were sustaining considerable damage in the thoracic region, including rib, sternum and clavicle fractures. Since significant thoracic and clavical spine damage may significantly alter the kinematics of the subject, and to avoid the risk of degrading the skeletal structure during the first test, each of the cadavers subsequently tested in the third contract year was subjected to a single test at a severity level determined to fill the gaps in the Table 1 - Selected cadaver anthropometry.

ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICES Anthropomorphic dummies are used as human surrogates in crash testing and allow reapeatable and consistent kinematic response measure- ments to be made. In order to provide a data base for comparing their kinematic responses to those of cadavers, two series of tests were conducted under the same test conditions using two different anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs): a certified Part 572 ATD (Hybrid-II ATD), and the Hybrid-Ill ATD recently developed by GM [7].

Since cadavers were externally instrumented in this study, direct comparisons may be made of the output of similarly mounted external trans- ducers. The additional instrumentation of the dummies therefore included the HSRI nine-acceler- ometer package for measuring the head motion, triaxial thoracic and biaxial pelvic accelerometers. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Complete and detailed documentation of the experimental results are given in references [1], [6] and [8]. In the remainder of this paper, graphical and tabular summaries of the most characteristic whole-body biomechanical response are presented. As part of test subject documentation, x-rays and anthropometric measurements were taken on each cadaver prior to each test. Post- test x-rays and autopsy were included in the testing protocol to identify and record thoracic damage due to the three -point belt system being used. Results indicate that all tested cadavers suffered rib cage damage to varying extents. The test injury records are summarized in Table 3. The kinematic responses of tested cadavers and dummies may be characterized by accele- rations, velocities and displacements of various body segments, as well as the belt forces. For each sled rim, data processing produced time- histories of as many as 52 such variables, some of which were directly measured, others resulting from computational procedures described in Appendix A of reference [6]. To be concise, only the eight most characteristic variables were selected to be included here. These variables are common to all three tested surrogates, and are the most compatible for comparison purposes. All time- histories were grouped by variable, surrogate and severity level, and the point -by-point average of each group is shown in the mean time-histories of Figs. 3 through 10. The standard deviation is shown only at the peak of each variable. The individual traces for the cadaver groups are shown in the composite plots of Figs. 11, 12 and 13. It should be noted that these plots include only valid time -histories since, in some tests, data processing was neither possible nor satisfactory because of instrumentation problems.</page><page sequence="5">3238 N.

In this paper, discussions of some areas of the test results which are felt to be of general interest to researchers in biomechanics are presented. More specific analyses are left to the investigator through the use of the detailed data appendices of reference [6]. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE RESULTS Effects of Repeated Tests. Many of the cadavers were tested more than once in the earlier stages of the program. This procedure was later abandoned and subsequently only single tests were conducted on each cadaver. The reason for this was primarily a concern over the effects of structural damage of the thorax on the response measures. A secondary concern relates to the possible general loosening or modification of structural linkages and resistance to motion that might occur in the skeletal system during the first test. Examination of the test results of those cadavers that were tested only once and comparison of the results with those obtained by repeated tests, with all tests at the same severity level, allows the assessment of such effects. The mid-severity tests provide the bulk of such data. The results of the single run tests (WBR-9, 11, 12 and 14) indicate that significant numbers of rib fractures occur during the first mid- se verity rim. Thus, it can be assumed that in all mid -se ve rity tests the first run produced some degree of structural disruption in the thorax. These results are summarized in Table 4, along with the peak resultant chest acceleration values for the pertinent mid -se ve rity tests. Table 4 - Comparison of mid-severity tests chest results.

Similarly, an examination of the acceleration time-histories (Appendix C of [ 6] ) reveals that the waveforms are generally the same for repeated runs with the second run peak having a slightly longer duration than the first run peak. In general, the repeated tests did not appreciably change the thoracic response, as measured by the thoracic spine acce 1er omete rs0 This may be indicative of the relative insensitivity of the thoracic spine acceleration to local deformation of the rib cage from frontal loading. The cervical spine (neck) is another region of the skeletal structure of the body that could be effected by repeated tests. The cervical spine linkage and its resistance to motion exert a strong influence on the dynamic response of the head in the type of impact tests conducted in this program. Review of the rotational and trans - lational head acceleration time -historie s for the repeated runs of cadavers WBR-4, 5 and 7 shows that the repetition of runs on the same cadaver produce very similar head acceleration profiles both in magnitude and in waveform. Thus, it appears that the repeated run technique used early in the program did not invalidate the data produced on head and chest acceleration response during the second test. Effects of Embalming. Two embalmed cadavers were tested in the WBR program. The main purpose for using embalmed cadavers was to determine if the embalming process, which stiffens soft tissue structures, could minimize the rib fractures that were found to be oc curing with the unembalmed cadaver tests. The embalmed cadavers were prepared for testing by limbering the knee, hip, elbow and shoulder joints until they were flexible and easily moved. The embalmed cadaver test series consisted of two mid-severity followed by a single high- severity run on one of the two cadavers, and of a high-severity run conducted on the second cadaver, for a total of four embalmed cadaver tests. In this series of tests, significant numbers of rib fractures were still produced. From these tests, it was not apparent that stiffening of the soft tissues of the thoracic organs and intercostal tissues had a marked effect on the number or distribution of rib fractures. The age and medical history of the cadaver are more likely to be the major factors that influence rib fractures. The response measures did not appear to be significantly effected by embalming. The chest acceleration time -hi storie s were comparable in magnitudes and waveforms to similar tests with unembalmed cadavers. With the head response,</page><page sequence="13">3246 N. M. ALEM, ET AL. there did appear to be a tendency for the embalmed cadaver to produce less-sharp peaks in head acceleration but the magnitude was not con- clusively modified. This effect could be attributed to greater resistance to motion on the cervical spine of the embalmed cadaver. COMPARISON OF HUMAN SURROGATE TEST RESULTS Head-Neck Response0 The dynamic response of the head, as indicated by head acceleration measurements, is controlled primarily by the neck linkage and its resistance to motion. Comparisons of the head responses of the three surrogates is thus a comparison of the neck characteristics. In the case of cadavers, the neck linkage is an accurate representation of the living human neck but the resistance to motion (muscle tone) is lacking. The Hybrid II dummy neck is a monolithic rubber structure that has been noted to be relatively stiff in comparison to the human neck, while the Hybrid in neck design represents an intermediate area between the two extremes. It has a segmented structure that is not as complex as that of the human neck with motion resisting elements that are not as stiff as the Hybrid II neck. These general characteristics are evident when comparing the head motion responses of the three surrogates. The most direct measure of neck response is the angular acceleration of the head. Fig. 3 shows the comparisons of the mean resultant head angular accelerations for the three surrogates at the three test severities. Note that the first major peak, which is related to the motion resistance level of the neck, is lowest in magnitude for the Hybrid II data. This is consistent with the stiff nature of the Hybrid II neck. The second major peak, which is related to the stopping of the head motion, occurs later with the Hybrid II in comparison with the cadavers and Hybrid III. The Hybrid III waveforms tend to be more like the cadaver responses than do those of the Hybrid II. The cadavers exhibit much greater variability in their response than the dummies do and the Hybrid III produced the most consistent response of all. The translational acceleration responses of the head, Fig. 4, exhibit less pronounced differences between the surrogates than the head rotational motion responses. In other studies, researchers have reported [9, 10] on the responses of the Hybrid II and human volunteers head/neck system, however, the restraint of the subjects in those studies were very different in comparison to the automotive restraints used in the present study, and preclude direct comparison of the test results. They produced much lower head accelerations than those found in the Hybrid n results reported here. It appears that muscular activity of the human volunteers produced lower stopping phase angular accelerations than those found in the Hybrid II, while in the present study, the cadavers exhibited higher angular accelerations than those of the Hybrid II during the stopping phase. An additional aspect of the head motion which is not apparent from the summary plots of the resultant accelerations and velocities is the differences in the three-dimensional nature of the motion of the head for each of the surrogates. In order to investigate the nature of any such differences, it is necessary to look at the individual components of the translational and rotational motion since the resultant is a root-mean-square blending of those components. As with the resultant data, the translational component responses are generally similar. The rotational data does show some differences, how- ever. In particular, the Hybrid III head motions displayed lower angular accelerations about the S-I axis (yaw) and consequently lower angular velocities about that axis. Both cadaver and Hybrid II tests produced higher values about that axis. An example of the differences between the three surrogates in terms of three-dimensional angular motion can be obtained by considering the angular acceleration peak values associated with the stopping of head motion during maximum forward excursion of the surrogate. This motion represents a highly complex three-dimensional motion as the surrogate interacts with the shoulder harness. The medium severity runs were analyzed for the peak values of all three components of angular acceleration and it was found that the mean peak values for the cadavers were the largest in all three directions. The component about the L-R axis (pitch) was the major value, with the Hybrid III mean value being 93% and the Hybrid II being 52% of the mean cadaver value. The component about the A-P (roll) and S-I (yaw) axes were much smaller than the pitch value about the L-R axis (30-40%) but there were interesting variations in the relative magnitudes between the surrogates. For mean peak angular acceleration about the S-I axis, the Hybrid II produced a value that was 79% as great as the cadaver value, while the Hybrid HI produced only 35%. For values about the A-P axis the Hybrid n produced 22% and the Hybrid m produced 64% of the value produced by the cadavers. This indicates that, with respect to the motion resistance of the neck, the stopping motion of the dummies is more restricted in certain directions than it is in the cadavers. It would appear that for motion about the S-I axis</page><page sequence="14">WHOLE-BODY RESPONSE 3247 the Hybrid III neck is the stiffest while for motion about the A-P axis the Hybrid n neck is the stiffest. These observations are consistent with the construction features of these necks. Chest Response. It is not possible to mount accelerometers internal to the chest in cadavers. In this test program, the chest accelerometers were mounted externally on both the cadavers and the dummies at levels which were comparable in S-I location to those internally mounted in the dummies. Only the external A-P axis data were chosen for comparison because of the different spatial location of the internal and external accelerometers. In the Hybrid n data, the A-P accelerations for both internal (not shown) and external mounting points are very similar in magnitude and waveform whereas for the Hybrid IH, the external data are consistently higher in magnitude (16-29%) and exhibited differences in waveform, particularly during the rebound or unloading phase of the traces. Comparison of the external A-P aceelero- meter data from all three surrogates (Fig. 5) shows that the magnitudes and waveforms of the two dummies are generally comparable to those obtained with the cadavers. The cadaver responses were more variable and of a more oscillatory nature which may be due to rib fracture effects and vertebral body motions not present with the dummies. Pelvis Response. As with the chest accelerometers, it was not possible to mount the pelvis accelerometers internally in the cadavers. Fig. 6 presents the A-P accele- ration mean time-histories for the externally mounted accelerometers0 The cadaver data exhibited broader wave- forms with lower peak values than the comparable dummy data. The dummy responses also featured an initial acceleration spike which was much more pronounced than that which occured with the cadavers. These differences in response may be related to differences in pelvic mass distribution and chest-pelvis linkages. Restraint System Loads. Mean time- histories of the restraint system loads are presented in Figs. 7 through 10. The upper shoulder belt data for the three surrogates were generally comparable in magnitude (although the variations in cadaver subject weight caused some individual traces to vary greatly from the mean data) but the cadaver responses exhibited longer duration waveforms than those for the dummies. Some differences were evident in the lap belt magnitudes, particularly the right lap belt values (which include the shoulder harness loads). These discrepencies may reflect differences in the structural linkages between the torso and the lower body as well as mass distribution differences between the surrogates. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS The past several years have seen the development of sophisticated computer models for simulation of whole -body motions of an automobile occupant within a crash environment. In computer simulations, the mathematical model of the occupant may be viewed as a surrogate for the living human. Computer models have been developed for predicting dynamic response in two and three dimensions. Two-dimensional models are use- ful, of course, only for simulation of events in which the primary motions are approximately planar. In this research program, kinematic responses to -Gx decelerations of cadavers restrained by a three -point belt system have been found to be definitely three-dimensional. However, the magnitudes of responses in the X-Z plane are generally on the order of double the out-of-plane components, and the peaks for out-of-plane components generally occur later than the peaks of in-plane components. It was therefore considered reasonable to use the MV MA Two-Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator [11], probably the most advanced of currently available 2-Ď models, to simulate responses of cadavers in sled tests performed in this research program. In the context of this program, the computer model was thus used as an additional type of surrogate for cadavers. DESCRIPTION OF SIMULATIONS The simulations conducted in this study may be described in terms of the surrogate, restraint system, initial configuration and sled deceleration profiles. Only the first two are discussed below. The initial configuration and sled decelerations were modeled as faithfully as possible after those described earlier for the experimental sled tests. Cadaver Model. The data set developed for describing the cadaver for MV MA 2-D simulations does not represent any specific cadaver used in the sled tests. The simulated cadaver is 173 cm and 64 kg. This approximates the height and weight of several test cadavers. Most of the anthropometric and biomechanical data used were taken from a study which investi- gated impact dynamics of free-fall victims [12]. Also used was a study which investigated the head-neck response of well-re strainted human volunteers to -Gx sled decelerations [13]. In both of these studies, the MVMA 2-D model was used extensively. Sagittal-plane bending stiffness data for flexion and extension was derived from</page><page sequence="15">3248 N- M- ALEM, ET AL. results reported by Mertz and Patrick [14] for adult male cadavers. Active muscle tension resistance to head-neck angulations was set to zero for the present study, as is appropriate for simulation of cadaver responses. Restraint System Model. The belt restraint system model in the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulator is not capable of accurately representing the test restraint system in all respects. However, a reasonable approximation can be modeled«, The primary problem is that the shoulder harness cannot be attached to the lap belt at a buckle. Since actual forward motion of the buckle is not large in comparison with the length of shoulder harness webbing between the buckle and the chest/shoulder area, the peak horizontal component of shoulder-harness force at the buckle can be expected to be small in comparison with that of the lap belt. For this reason, no large inaccuracies are introduced in the simulations by assuming the lower end of the shoulder harness to be fixed to an M anchor" on the sled at the initial position of the buckle. The modeled belt restraint system included com- pensations for the dimensions of inextensible sections of the actual system, such as the buckle and anchor hardware. Also, out-of-plane webbing lengths were considered in the development of force-strain web- bing characteristics supplied as input data to the com- puter model. The base stiffness was that of the webbing of the actual belt system. The loading curve was determined from a laboratory test to be nearly linear for loads less than about 3. 5 kN and strains less than about 0.086; the constant stiffness de- termined was 41 kN/(cm/cm). The seat modeled for the simulations was a good representation of the seat in the sled buck. The seatback was 25 degrees back from the vertical and was modeled with a hard foam surface. A composite of hard foam and soft foam was modeled for the head rest, and a hard seatboard was simulated. RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS The results summarized here are for three simulations which differ only in the acceleration profiles of the sled. These were taken from a low-severity sled test A-926 (78-kg, 178-cm cadaver WBR-7), an intermediate -se verity test A-869 (61-kg, 165-cm cadaver WBR-4) and a high-severity test A-866 (57-kg, 173-cm cadaver WBR-3). Because the model is capable of predicting only plannar motion and because the cadavers used in the three actual tests were different in size from the 64-kg, 173-cm simulation "cadaver, M simulation responses are expected to correlate with actual responses in varying degrees. Head responses were selected as the primary descriptors of subject response in the sled test program and also as the primary indicators of correlation between computer simulation and actual test dynamics. Shown in Figs. 14 and 15 are comparisons between model and actual responses of head pitch acceleration and velocity, head A-P and S-I linear accelerations and upper and lower shoulder belt forces. Best agreement with simulated in-plane pitching can be expected before the out-of-plane motions in the tests become significant. DISCUSSION OF SIMULATIONS Discussion of simulation results should be prefaced by emphasis of a primary feature of the simulations, namely, that a single "simu- lation cadaver" was used for all three simulations, while three different cadavers of various heights and weights were used in the corresponding sled tests. Consequently, simulation and test responses are not expected to be in exact agree- ment«, The results demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict all the basic characteristics of the dynamic responses with respect to peak magnitudes, phases and curve waveform and that these characteristics are seemingly much more sensitive to deceleration conditions than to moderate variations of subject anthropometry. Magnitudes and phase for predicted pitch velocities, pitch accelerations, and anatomical components of linear head accelerations are seen to be in good agreement with test results through the second peak (positive or negative) in each response history. Predicted peak belt loads range from 13 to 54 percent higher than test results for the upper and lower segments of the shoulder harness. Predicted peak lap belt loads are generally low and differ from test peaks by an average of 16 percent. Pre- dicted peaks from translational accelerations of the head, thorax and pelvis are in reasonably good agreement with test results, differing by an average of 13 percent. Modifying the action of the lap belt would not significantly alter head-neck response since the pelvis is well-restrained in both test and simulation and the neck is remote from the pelvis. Somewhat more effect might be expected from modifying shoulder harness action, but no effort was made to improve the modeling of any portion of the restraint system. Shoulder harness loads may be high because belt loading was represented as strictly linear while, in fact, the webbing softens for strains greater than 0. 086 and loads greater than 3. 5 kN. Although there is considerable similarity between simulation and test results for head</page><page sequence="16">WHOLE-BODY RESPONSE 3249 Fig. 14 - Comparison between actual and model responses for head pitch angular acceleration and velocity and for head A-P translational acceleration Fig. 15 - Comparison between actual and model responses for head S-I translational acceleration and for lower and upper shoulder belt loads</page><page sequence="17">3250 N. M. ALEM, ET AL. responses through the second peak of each response history, there is considerable disagreement, of an oscillatory nature, after the second peak. (Simulation results are not shown beyond 130 ms. ) This is explained partly by the fact that out-of-plane motions in the tests begin to become significant, but the differences are caused mostly by a model shortcoming. In this domain of the responses, the oscillations correlate exactly with peak "joint-stop" torques at the upper- and lower-neck articulations of the two-joint, MVMA 2-D neck. Joint-stop activity is more severe than reasonable because: 1) nonlinear joint stiffness are unreasonably large except for small and moderate angulations, and 2) too little viscous damping is modeled. Without modifications to the analytical model and the computer code for the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulator, it is not possible to both more accurately represent the neck with regard to nonlinear static loading characteristics and velocity-dependent energy loss and also guarantee proper hysteretic energy loss upon unloading. In short, the opportunity offered by this study to compare model predictions with cadaver response has pointed out the need for an improved, more general joint model. In particular, it is clear that minimum improvements would include: 1) the addition of a linear term to the quadratic and cubic joint-stop torques of the current model (August 1978), and 2) a modification to make viscous damping coefficients dependent on angulation (at least, zero and non-zero in different parts of the range). Ideally, provision should be made for tabular specification of joint torque loading curves. With the model improvements just outlined and appropriate specification of associated biomechanical data, the improper oscillations seen after the first two peaks in head responses should be absent because of softer loading and dissipation of kinetic energy. While it is desirable to eliminate the aforementioned inaccuracies in predicted responses, it should be noted that the usefulness of results obtained and illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15 is uncompro- mised. Since maximum values for the response parameters always occur as one of the first two peaks in test results, the domain after the first two peaks of the predicted responses may simply be neglected as long as the peak values of responses are of primary interest. Agreement between predicted and test responses is excellent through the first two peaks, particularly for the cadavers of tests A-866 and A-869, which are both near to the simulation cadaver in height and weight. SUMMARY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Procedures for handling and preparing cadavers for a sled test were developed. These include a step-by-step protocol for moving, storing and placing the cadaver for surgery, x-raying and for testing. Instrumentation mounting techniques were also developed to allow effective and reliable monitoring of various transducer signals. Thus, transducers were mounted on the skull for measurement of the head motion and on the thoracic spine and pelvic complex to measure the chest and pelvis accelerations. ANALYTICAL METHODS Several new analytical techniques were developed, validated and applied during this program. These include a general-purpose digital filtering technique, a three-dimensional motion analysis program to measure the motion of the head or any other rigid body, a three- dimensional x-ray technique to locate implanted instrumentation and, finally, an improved Head Injury Criterion (HIC) computation algorithm. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS The computer simulations carried out for this program produced four major accomplish- ments. First, it has demonstrated that a two- dimensional whole-body motion model can be used effectively for simulating important events of a crash history which includes large motions in three dimensions. Second, the study has demonstrated that anthropometric and bio- mechanical data developed for the head and neck of the MVMA 2-D model are reasonable, while at the same time suggesting significant improve- ments that might be made in the joint model. Third, this study has provided an additional degree of validation of a crash victim simulator which is finding more and more use as a research tool. Finally, the degree of agreement between predicted and experimental head and neck responses suggests that research programs combining computer simulations with instru- mented tests might be particularly productive. SOME ASPECTS OF THE RESULTS The discussion of experimental results emphasized the differences between the responses of various surrogates. In particular, the discussion pointed out some of the factors influencing the experimental results and con-</page><page sequence="18">WHOLE-BODY RESPONSE 325 j eluded that repeated runs on the same cadaver did not invalidate the results of the second run, and that embalming did not significantly affect the response measures. The discussion included a comparison of responses of the various tested human surrogates. Specifically, it was concluded that the head- neck response is consistent with the physical construction of the various necks. It was also concluded that the chest response of both Hybrids II and III, as measured by spinal accelerometers, is in general agreement with that of the cadavers, although the cadaver chest responses were more variable and oscillatory, which may be attributed to rib fracture effects and vertebral body motions not present in either dummy. The pelvic response of cadavers had a broader waveform than that of the dummies, but all were in general agreement. Any discrepencies may be due to differences in the pelvic mass distribution and chest-pelvis linkages. Similar observations may be made about the restraint system loads.
