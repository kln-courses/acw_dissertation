It can best be thought of as related to Pacific Coast cultures of South America and to the southwestern United States. Several authors have seen similarities between cultural elements which appear both in western Mexico and the North American Southwest. J. Charles Kelley (1966:101) has mentioned that a strong relation exists between Hohokam pottery and the pottery from the Mexican site of Chupicuaro, in Guanajuato. Based on Kelley's line of thought, we have also found that other elements appear both in the Southwest, in western Mexico, and in Chupicuaro, as well as in cultures of supposedly northern Mexican origin. These include pottery designs, forms, and motifs. We also pointed out that these similar elements extended back into time, since some of them already appear in the site of Tlatilco, Mexico (Braniff 1972). Tlatilco has been considered Middle Formative or Middle Preclassic, 900-500 B.C., although recent investigations extend its chronology back into the Early Formative, 1300-900 B.C. (Tolstoy and Paradis 1970:349). Chupicuaro, Guanajuato, on the other hand, is considered Upper Preclassic or Late Formative, 500-100 B.C. (McBride 1969:45). Recent work by various investigators has suggested that Chupicuaro should not be considered a mere site, but rather a "tradition" or "culture" since it has been isolated in several sites in northern Michoacin and southern Guanajuato, and still farther to include most of Central Mexico. This Chupicuaro tradition greatly influenced the cultures of central Mexico and seems to have been a determinant in producing the first urban centers of the Late Preclassic period. Its importance as a cultural focus has only now been reconsidered, though Jimenez Moreno in 1966 had mentioned that "Chupicuaro seems to have played a role in western Mexico comparable to that of the .... Olmec culture in the rest of Mexican Mesoamerica" (McBride 1969:47). Lister (1955) included Chupicuaro within "West Mexico" though geographically this site is in the center of Mexico. Certainly this tradition 215</page><page sequence="2">216 BRANIFF does not seem to belong to the same cultures of the central valleys and much less to the Olmec world and its cultural inheritors. As a matter of fact, western Mexico at times has been considered not fully Mesoamerican because it lacks some of the characteristic traits of that cultural area, and also because it followed a different process of cultural change. Western Mexico also contains a number of elements which relate it to other cultural areas on the Pacific Coast, both in Central and in South America which, again, gives this area a very special and different character within the Mexican world. During the first semester of 1972 an informal symposium was held in Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico, on the general theme of the Olmec culture. A good number of ideas and papers were presented during this lengthy discussion, of which the following pertain to our present problem: 1) David Grove was at that time excavating the nearby site of Chalcatzingo, which had been known for its Olmec bas-reliefs. It was therefore considered "Olmec." However, previous investigations by Grove along the Rio Cuautla in Morelos, had enabled him to distinguish, at that point, two traditions in the area, one of them Olmec, and another, non-Olmec and more ancient which he calls "Tlatilco style" or "Rio Cuautla style," which in turn is related to West Mexico. This earlier "Tlatilco style" and the West Mexican influence in Morelos is dated within the Early Preclassic or Early Formative, 1300-900 B.C. Grove (n.d.a) also mentions that some elements of this Tlatilco Style and West Mexico are still earlier in South America, suggesting a very early northward diffusion. These two cultural components of Morelos (Olmec and non-Olmec) are also recognizable in Tlatilco itself. Tlatilco had also been considered generally as Olmec and of Middle Preclassic or Middle Formative times. Some elements had been called Olmec simply because of their supposed association with Olmec styles, notwithstanding the fact they do not appear in the Olmec heartland at all (Grove n.d.a, n.d.b). According to Grove the following items are not considered Olmec, either because they are more ancient in other areas (Chiapas and South America) or because they are not present in the Olmec heartland: roller seals, and roller seal designs, D2, D4, and K figurines, rocker stamp, differential firing, "Tlatilco" bottles, red-on-brown bottles with design limited by incision, hollow figures, belted bottles ("bules"), stirrup spouts, obsidian flakes (no prismatic blades), resist decoration, and red slip (Figure 1 and Table 1, Numbers 23-36). 2) Isabel Kelly participated in our symposium with the presentation of her ideas on the recently obtained material from Colima and West Mexico. She has since published an article on this material (Kelly 1972) and a lengthy study is in preparation. This material constitutes what she calls the "Capacha Complex" for which she has a radiocarbon date of 1450 B.C.

This Capacha Complex includes a number of pottery forms similar to the non-Olmec "Tlatilco Style" from Morelos and Tlatilco. She points out that some of these forms and decorative styles bear relation to more ancient South American Pacific wares (Kelly 1972) 3) During 1970, Arturo Oliveros excavated two shaft tombs at El Opefio, Michoacain (Oliveros 1971). His material is also dated by radiocarbon within the Early Formative (1500 B.C.) and quite a number of items found in his excavation conform with Kelly's Capacha Complex and Grove's non- Olmec "Tlatilco Style" material from Morelos and Tlatilco. The work of these three authors demonstrates quite convincingly that a very old West Mexican tradition existed in Early Formative times which has some antecedents in South America and which influenced the Central Mexican areas. This West Mexican influence is older and different from that of the Olmec Gulf Coast culture. If we accept this supposition, we must add to Grove's list of non-Olmec antecedents, those which appear both in Kelley's and Oliveros' material, which are also non-Olmec and most of which appear in Tlatilco. These items are the following: A) From El Opefio, Michoacin: "bird bowl" with open beak, bird bowl or "shoe pot", vessel in the form of a dog, figure of sitting man with bowl on back and another between the legs, shaft tomb, ball game player, ball game bat, "boomerang," "little yokes," use of hematite in burials, cranial deformation, trepanation, "Tlatilco" type projectile points, and bird stone figures. B) From Capacha, Colima: tecomate, "multiple" or complex bowls, restricted bowls, spider legs, line and punch decoration incised, hatchured triangle, two perforations on edge of bowl, and use of specular hematite (Figure 1 and Table 1, Numbers 1-22).</page><page sequence="6">220 BRANIFF 4) Our collaboration in the symposium consisted of a comparison of Kelly's, Oliveros', and Grove's non-Olmec, Early Formative, West Mexican material with that of the Chupicuaro tradition of the Late Formative, and with still later material from Guanajuato, Michoacin, Zacatecas, Durango, and the Southwest. It seems that Chupicuaro had its roots in this West Mexican tradition, as was unknowingly implicit in previous (Braniff 1972) comparisons with the Tlatilco material. By Chupicuaro times, some 800 years later, quite a number of the early West Mexican elements had survived; others, though not mentioned for the Capacha, El Opefio, or Morelos Early Formative sites, are present in Tlatilco, and certainly may prove to belong to this West Mexican tradition. This is the case of the anthropomorphic bowls with fillets representing arms and legs, the bowls representing a human face, connected bowls, doughnut bowls, basket handles on bowls, kidney, ovoid, and square shaped bowls, decorations on the rims of cups, indentations in the pedestals of high annular base cups, apparent coiling, bisymetric red on bay line designs, and the grooved ax (Figure 1 and Table 1, Numbers 37-48). A third group of elements appear in Chupfcuaro with no antecedents (to my knowledge), but which seems to have survived into later times and especially into Western Mexico and Southwestern cultures: Double stepped decoration with central rectangle, the bullseye, the frog (or only its hind legs), the thunderbird, the dog and other quadruped animals, stylized human figures, the lizard, and a figure in bed (Figure 1 and Table 1, Numbers 50-57). Though not yet present in Chipicuaro, the stepped greque (xicalcolhuiqui) and the "nose hook" appear on the scene, both originally South American, and used by later Mesoamerican and Southwestern cultures (Figure 1 and Table 1, Numbers 58-59). Many of these Chupicuaro-West Mexican elements continued to appear through the years and up to very recent prehispanic times. Their distribution seems to be concentrated along West Mexico, which includes the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, a site occupied more than a thousand years after Chupicuaro and two thousand after the Early Formative still has material reminiscent of that ancient tradition. Miguel Covarrubias, many years ago (1957), felt that Western Mexico was quite different from the rest of Mesoamerica, and curiously, it seemed more intimately related with Central and South America and the southwestern U.S. than with rest of Mexico. We might venture to propose that there are two Mesoamericas, one of which is the offspring of the traditional Olmec mother; and another, more barbarian, the offspring of a West Mexican father. They both had common South American grandparents but produced local and original idiosyncracies which were maintained up to hispanic times, and possibly later.</page><page sequence="7">West Mexican Tradition and Southwestern United States 221 NOTE We would be very grateful to receive additions and amendments to this paper.
