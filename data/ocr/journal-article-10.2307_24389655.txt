<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preface: Douglas Livingstone's Prose Writings Dirk Klopper I should like to thank Stephen Gray for his conception of this collection of the prose writings of Douglas Livingstone and his judicious selection of items; Mariss Stevens for her detailed description of the NELM collection of Livingstone's papers; and NELM staff for their compilation of the bibliography. Reading the pieces collected here - from the biographical essay "Leaving School" published in 1966 to the interview conducted by Monica Fairall on the SABC radio programme "The Poet Speaks" in 1993 - I am struck by Livingstone's dedication to the craft of the essay as much as to the craft of the poem. Artful manipulation of voice, pithy and vivid observation, dynamic cadence of thought ... these are features as evident in the prose as they are in the poetry. I am also struck by Livingstone's provocations, his dissenting positions in relation to what he sees as mainstream, identified in the 1970s with the advocates of what he calls "Polit-Lit" ("Africa Within Us?"), and in the 1990s with what he describes as the "rectitudes particular to the South African liberal inscape" ("Alan Paton and the Logos"). If Livingstone's provocations arise from his resistance to received ideas and generalising abstractions, his effectiveness as essay writer lies in the way his dissentions are indistinguishable from his style of writing, his stylistics of provocation. Livingstone subscribes in his essays to a kind of gruff honesty, whether he's describing his youthful rebellion at the strictures of school life, his pragmatic understanding of the poet as labourer rather than as visionary, or his disparagement of doctrinaires of whatever persuasion. His portrayal of his imaginary audience as "witty, erudite, ironic and sympathetic" ("Interview") English in Africa 40 No. 3 (December 2013): 7â€”10 DOI: http://dx.doi.oiy/10.4314/eia.v40i3.1</page><page sequence="2">8 DIRK KLOPPER aptly captures the accent of his own writings, in the essays as much as in the poems. Livingstone is a writer of his time and place in two senses. Most obviously he is of his time and place in as much as he is actively concerned with topical issues, and takes a stand on things, albeit an increasingly cynical one, if the narrative created by the essays is to be trusted. One may not wish to stand where he stands, nor see the world as he sees it, but his delineation of his situation is lyrically and topologically compelling. Then he is of his time and place in the sense of the positions he occupies within prevailing horizons of understanding, from which he tackles issues that matter to him, such as the meaning of poetry, the threat of environmental degradation, the politics / poetics of decolonisation. This is not to suggest that Livingstone's positions are fixed, or that they necessarily cohere. Given his contestations of what he sees as sanctimonious cant, self-serving abstractions, or hypocritical insincerities, his engagements tend to be situational. Accordingly, his conception of the word "logos" is that while it may have a metaphysical dimension, for him it pertains "primarily to words of reason," and ought therefore to be used in the lower case ("Alan Paton"). However, his own words of reason, his reasoning, leads in various directions - to literary formalism, to biological determinism, to political anarchism - and, when thrown together, create interesting tensions. Literary language, says Livingstone, yields its truth through the discipline of writing ("Address to the Berg Writers' Seminar"). This discipline includes economic expression, responsive but contained feeling, attentive observation of the phenomenal world, and the making of vivid connections between things. Importantly, for him, it is developed through close acquaintance with the body and traditions of poetic thought. All the same, when Livingstone states that good poems are "game reserves of the imagination" ("Writing Poetry"), he presents poetry not as an artefact of vivid rhythmic utterances but as analogous to a piece of the world, and the piece of the world he has in mind is dedicated specifically to the preservation of natural phenomena against a rapacious modernity. Biology is everywhere in Livingstone's thinking, including his thoughts on politics. When pressed to pronounce on his own political affiliations, he claims that the only "authentic politics" is that of "the bacteriological culture plate: dog eat dog; survival of the most powerful, the most vicious" ("Alan Paton"). He speaks of the "unchanging texture of human nature" ("Background to Tales from the Tower of BabeF), of fearing the earth's fate "less than humanity's" ("The Other Job"), and of not taking "a sanguine view of homo sap" ("Interview").</page><page sequence="3">PREFACE 9 A shift occurred around the time of Livingstone's change in career in the early 1960s from diagnostic pathologist to marine microbiologist, motivated, he says, by a misanthropic feeling that he was "finished with humanity" and wished to devote his energies "to healing the planet." By the late 1980s he regarded this ambition as "comically chivalrous," and adopted the fatalistic view that the earth would survive not because of him but because it is "a living cell," and if you "threaten a cell," he says, it will "retreat if it can, or fight back," even if "in modified form, with modified life-forms" ("The Other Job"). Perhaps, in our time and place, it is Livingstone's environmental thinking rather than his thinking on poetry or politics that is of greatest interest. Not that these forms of thought are mutually exclusive, but the environmental thinking, as it unfolds in his writings, emerges as the more embracing, offering a persuasive theoretical paradigm and a lexicon of arresting metaphors. Besides, the relationship between the microbiologist and the poet, between the scientific understanding and the poetic understanding, remains intriguing. Livingstone sees science as a "search for the truth" and poetry as an "interpretation of the truth," making them distinct but complementary spheres, "two sides of one single coin" ("Interview"). He speaks of "philosophical and historical awareness" as a "vital adjunct to 'understanding' the nature of scientific 'truth'," and his interest in scientific truth lies in the relationship it establishes between the whole and the part (whether a cell, an animal, or the earth itself), leading him to the view that "it takes a membrane to make sense out of order in biology" ("Science and Truth"). If, for Livingstone the scientist, the membrane defines a living thing as an organised whole, making it "self-contained" ("Science and Truth"), for Livingstone the poet there exists the possibility of a "transfiguring osmosis" between the human inhabitant and the continent, an Africa "that has to be gentled somehow into the human psyche" ("Alan Paton"). Speaking of his own relationship with his adopted home, he identifies himself as a "white African" and maintains that his involvement with Africa is "a profound and passionate and [hopefully] compassionate one" ("A Note on A Rhino for the Boardroom'''). For Livingstone, the continent is a living thing: it requires gentling, elicits passion and compassion. This follows on his view that each region or place has "its own character or psychology" which exists apart from that of its inhabitants ("Note"). While this may be regarded as anthropomorphic (the psychology of place?) and paternalistic (Africa requires gentling?), it</page><page sequence="4">10 DIRKKLOPPER does accentuate that the continent both alive and other, which is preferable to seeing it as a resource. In this respect, of interest is Livingstone's contention that Africa is not identical with the people who inhabit it, and he roundly decries what he calls "territorial chauvinists" ("Penning Ulysses"). To conclude with a quotation from what is probably Livingstone's most widely read prose piece: "Each of us is a walking universe of completely disparate worlds, continents and seas, with immense and differing populations, all organised together into some sort of functioning coherence with the single determinant (if we are sane) to preserve life and what is left of our planet."
