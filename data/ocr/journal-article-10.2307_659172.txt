<plain_text><page sequence="1">HJALMAR STOLPE By STEWART CULIN1 Dr Hjalmar Stolpe, the distinguished Swedish archeologist and anthropologist, who died January 27, 1905, was born in Gaifle, Sweden, April 23, 1841. He was graduated in 186o from the University of Upsala, from which institution he received the degree of Ph.D. in 1872. Dr Stolpe's first scientific investigations were in zo6logy, and were particularly devoted to ants. In 1870, aided by the Academy of Science, he studied the ants of the island of Gotland, and in the following year began to apply himself to archeologic research, in which his interest was awakened through his studies of amber, pursued on account of the insects which are enclosed in it. Led by the fact that amber is found in profusion in the so-called "black soil" of the island of BjSrk6, in Lake Malar, he went there in search of it. His finds inspired him with a desire for archeological investigation, and at his own initiative and expense he carried on excavations in the Bj6rk6 soil. These soon attracted the attention of friends of archeological research, and with the aid of national stipends Stolpe continued the work from 1871 to 1879 and in 1881. In these studies Dr Stolpe was assisted by his general acquain- tance with zo6logy, for as a considerable part of the finds consisted of bones of various animals, both wild and domestic, and worked and unworked, much knowledge and perseverance were required in identifying them. Dr Stolpe made a thorough investigation of the large grave-fields on the northern half of BjorkS, which he mapped in 1888-89. These researches are regarded as models of their kind, but Dr Stolpe published only brief accounts of the results. His collections and notes, however, are preserved in the Historical Museum, and it 1 Condensed from the memoir by Dr Gustaf Retzius in Ymer, Halft I, Stockholm, 1905. 150</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST N.

Early in the seventies Dr Stolpe had definitely decided on his future career. In 1872 he visited the museums of Copenhagen, and thenceforward one of the foremost objects of his life was to create a museum of ethnography in his native country. In this, however, he was destined to encounter many difficulties. In 1873 he was appointed as lecturer on Northern archeology at the Univer- sity of Lund, and in that and the following year he co6perated with Hans Hildebrand, Oscar Montelius, and Gustaf Retzius in the for- mation of the present Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geo- graphy. During this decade Stolpe took an important part in science in Sweden. It was mainly through his initiative that the Society arranged for the general ethnographical exposition in Stock- holm, in 1878-79, for which space was provided in the palace of the heir presumptive. He collected for this exhibition a large num- ber of ethnographic objects from Swedish public and private col- lections, devoting much time to their determination and arrange- ment, and prepared a comparative catalogue which was published in the Society's periodical. In I88o-'8 I Stolpe visited the principal ethnographic museums and private collections in Europe, and in 1883 he rejoiced at receiving a commission as ethnologist to ac- company the frigate Vanadis on a voyage round the world to se- cure material for his cherished hope --a Swedish ethnographical museum. From this expedition, which extended over a period of two years, he brought home more than 7,500 specimens, in part from South America where he made excavations at Ancon in Peru, in part from the South Pacific where he investigated the grave-fields of Tahiti and Oahu, and partly from Japan and the East Indies. On his return to Sweden he arranged an exhibition of these col- lections, which became known as the "Vanadis exhibition," first in Stockholm in 1886, and. in the following year in Gothenburg. These collections were incorporated afterward with the other ethno- graphic collections that had been arranged through him, the whole being opened to the public in the Royal Museum in 1889. Simultaneously with his ethnographical studies Stolpe was con- stantly engaged in archeological research, especially in connection</page><page sequence="4">152 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 8, 19o6 with his duties in the Historical Museum. On the conclusion of the researches at Bj6rk6 he was commissioned to investigate the grave- fields in Vendel, Uppland, where some of the most remarkable finds of the Iron age in Sweden had been discovered. Needless to say, this work was carried on with the same care and minuteness that characterized his operations at Bjork6. The examination of the caves on the island of Stora Karls6n at Gottland also fell to him and was prosecuted for a long time. It is to be regretted that Stolpe did not find the opportunity to publish more exhaustive descriptions. By nature he was extremely punctilious and critical in the preparation of his writings, desiring them to reach perfection both in form and in content before publication. A series of works of monumental character, both in Swedish archeology and in general ethnology, might have been built upon his researches, but partly through force of adverse circumstance and partly on account of his deep conscientiousness, he was not successful in concluding them before his untimely death. Stolpe's inclinations and occupations were involved in a long struggle between archeology and ethnography. He had a warm interest in both, through it was apparent that ethnography was the dearer to him. When, therefore, he was commissioned by the Academy of Science to superintend the ethnographical department of the Royal Museum from January I, 19oo, the fondest wish of his life was realized. To administer successfully the duties created by this assignment was, however, no easy task. Although he had made extended observations on the arrangement of foreign museums, had unlimited interest in his work, great practical experience and effi- ciency, and a highly-developed artistic sense, the external conditions were unfavorable. The ethnographic collections of the Royal Mu- seum were contained in widely separated, rented quarters, in some respects most unsuitable and inadequate, and the means at his dis- posal for their maintenance and growth were so limited that success seemed impossible. But, thanks to his talent and perseverance, he succeeded in a few years in rearranging the collections on a geo- graphic basis and in so carefully classifying and cataloguing them that the Museum is now as efficient and attractive as it is possible to make it in its present quarters. The collections were rapidly in-</page><page sequence="5">CULIN] HJALMAR STOLPE 153 creased, for Stolpe's intense interest in his work inspired interest in others. Notable among the acquisitions were the magnificent col- lections from Costa Rica, gathered by Mr C. V. Hartman, which were presented by Mr Ake Sj6gren, and the collections brought from South America by Baron Erland Nordenski6ld and Count Eric von Rosen. In January, 1903, Dr Stolpe was appointed direc- tor of the ethnographical section of the Royal Museum in recogni- tion of his services. Hjalmar Stolpe's work for ethnography was of an epoch-mak- ing character. He was not only the first in Sweden to devote him- self after extensive preparatory studies wholly to its interests and to bring together rich collections for a general ethnographical mu- seum, but he made other contributions to the science that won recog- nition abroad. During his extensive travels in Europe, in I88o-8i, when he visited numerous ethnographical museums, "it soon became appar- ent," as he said fifteen years later, " that one real key to a scientific treatment of ethnographic objects is found in the comparative study of ornamental art." " It may seem strange," he added, " that this field was not cultivated long before, but such is the case. Many circumstances have contributed to delay the development of this branch of ethnography. The first is probably that the majority of ethnological museums are not yet scientifically arranged." Stolpe, a trained naturalist, at once applied to ethnography the comparative method inaugurated by Sven Nilsson in archeological research, and as a schooled archeologist the typological method that had been so successfully developed and employed by Hans Hilde- brand and Oscar Montelius in archeology; and thus he became himself a pioneer in the new ethnology. The English archeologist, Lane Fox, afterward General Pitt-Rivers, is the only one who had previously applied similar methods; but Stolpe was the first in the field to clearly lay down scientific principles and endeavor to explain rationally the problems presented, especially as regards the orna- mental art of primitive peoples. In his significant work, "Fea- tures of Evolution in the Ornamental Art of Primitive Peoples," published in Ymner for 1890-91, and later reprinted in English and German, he presented some of the results of his profound studies along this line.</page><page sequence="6">1 54 AMERICAN ANTHROPOL OGIST [N. s., 8, 190o6 During his visit to foreign museums in 188o-8I, Dr Stolpe, an accomplished artist, made numerous copies of ethnographical objects bearing ornamental designs, and brought home more than 3,ooo rubbings of carvings, as well as a large number of detailed sketches. This valuable material, which in the course of years he greatly augmented, made it possible for him later to con- duct extensive comparative studies in the art of primitive peoples. Thus he was enabled to establish six different provinces within which ornamentation followed different laws of style among the natives of Polynesia. In 1896 he published an edition de luxe of his "Studies of Ornamental Art: a Contribution to the Biology of Ornamental Designs," which was awarded the Loubat prize by the Academy of Letters, History, and Antiquity. In this work Stolpe gave a clear presentation of the existing knowledge of the decorative art of the North American Indians, as well as a large series of reproductions of a group of South American clubs with carved anthropomorphic and zodmorphic ornaments that furnish a clear conception of their typologic development. In the fall of 1903 Dr Stolpe visited the United States as a delegate to the Thirteenth International Congress of Americanists and made many warm friends among his scientific colleagues in America. At home Stolpe was esteemed from his youth as a comrade among a large circle of friends. His pleasant address and fine conversa- tional talent, with his superior education and agreeable wit, made themselves widely felt. He was tall of stature with handsome features of the genuine Northern type, and, gifted with a fine, powerful voice, he was a particularly popular Bellman singer. From his appearance one would have imagined him still a young man, since the vigor of youth, with a cheerful, jocular tempera- ment, seemed to retard the effect of advancing years. He possessed the sensitiveness of the artist and the poet, a sensitiveness that was especially apparent when his ideals of justice were shocked by wrongs perpetrated by so-called civilized people upon primitive folk. As an author he possessed a good style, which is well illus- trated in his excellent sketches of the Danish ethnographer Kristian Bahnsson and of Anders Retzius. He was a close student, often</page><page sequence="7">CULIN] HJALMAR STOLPE 155 working late into the night at the expense of his health. He was happy in his home life, which was made beautiful by a wife and daughter whose lives were examples of unselfish devotion. His daughter, the apple of his eye, assisted him for several years in his scientific labors. Stolpe was not only Sweden's first real ethnographer, but was one of the foremost champions of the science in his generation. The Ethnographical Museum in Stockholm, wherever it may find its final place, will remain his perpetual monument. BIBLIOGRAPHY I.
