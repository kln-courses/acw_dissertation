<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW SOURCE FOR ONE OF PASCAL'S PENSÉES John A. Gallucci What is the origin of the Latin sentence in fragment no. 755- 258?' As presented in the Lafuma edition, this "pensée" reads: Unusquisque sibi deum fingit Le dégou(t)2 Francis Kaplan, a recent editor of the Pensées, translates the Latin phrase in a note and then asks: "... citation d'origine inconnue ou texte de Pascal lui-même?"3 In the Pensées, one does find several Latin sentences that Pascal did in fact compose himself. Such is the case, for example, in fragment 851-842, where Pascal, quoting the Gospel of John (vi. 30) in Latin: " Quod ergo tu facis signum , ut videamus et credamus tibi," adds this commentary: "non dicunt : quam doctrinam predicas " ("They do not say: 'What doctrine do you preach?' "). 4 According to Brunschvicg, however, the Latin line 1 For each fragment of the Pensées, we give the number adopted by Lafuma in his Pascal, Œuvres complètes, Louis Lafuma, éditeur (Paris: Editions du Seuil, collection "L'Intégrale," 1963); this first number will be followed by the number as given in Brunschvicg's editions. 2 "Each forges a god for himself / Disgust." 3 Les Pensées de Pascal, éd. Francis Kaplan (Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1 982), 1 60. Fragment no. 755 Lafuma -258 Brunschvicg corresponds, in the rather arbitrary classification adopted by Kaplan, to no. 137. Kaplan's translation reads: "Chacun se forge un dieu pour lui." 4 Another, similar, example, in the Pensées, is found in Pascal's additions to religious texts cited in fragment 825-901 (my translation of the two lines follows): Semble réfuter [Lafuma's reading] Humilibus dat gratiam; an ideo non dédit humilitatem?</page><page sequence="2">64 ROMANCE NOTES in fr. 755-258 "résumait sans doute pour Pascal le chapitre sur les faux dieux du Livre de la Sagesse. En particulier: Et cum labore vano Deum fingit de eodem luto , Ule qui paulo ante de terra factus fuerat... xv, 8 -Homo enim fecit illos [nationum déos J: et qui spiritum mutuatus est , is finxit illos . Nemo enim sibi similem homo poterit Deum fingere, xv, 16." 5 The most important of the modem editions of Pascal - those of Tourneur, Lafuma, Sellier, Le Guern (as well as several less important editions that I have checked) -all give the same references as Brunschvicg. Yet it is possible to cite another Latin text which is closer in its wording to Pascal's fragment, namely, the last line of a Latin poem by Petronius, which modern editors give as fragment no. xxvii: Primus in orbe deos fecit timor, ardua cáelo fulmina cum caderent discussaque moenia flammis atque ictus flagraret Athos. Mox Phoebus ab ortu lustrata deuectus humo lunaeque senectus et reparatus honos, hinc signa effusa per orbem et permutatis disiunctus mensibus annus. Profecit uitium iamque error iussit inanis agrícolas primos Cereri dare messis honores, palmitibus plenis Bacchum uincire, Palemque pastorům gaudere manu. Natat obrutus omnis Neptunus demersus aqua, Pallasque tabernas uindicat. Et uoti reus et qui uendidit orbem, iam sibi quisque deos auido certamine fingit .6 Sui eum non receperunt, quotquot autem non receperunt, an non erant sui? "To the humble he gives grace" (I Peter 5, 5); [Pascal adds]: does he not therefore give humility? "His own people did not receive him" {John I, 11); [Pascal adds]: all those, however, who did not receive him, is it that they were not his own people? Pascal's own mastery of Latin is indicated elsewhere in his works, in his numerous mathematical writings, for example, but especially in the impatience which signals an abrupt transition from French to Latin in a letter to Fermat (29 July 1654): "... et je vous le dirai en latin, car le français n'y vaut rien..." (in Pascal, Œuvres complètes, 44). 5 Leon Brunschvicg, Œuvres de Biaise Pascal, vol. XII, 3ème tirage, Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1925, p. 184. The Revised Standard Version translates as follows: "With misspent toil, he forms a futile god from the same clay -this man who was made of earth a short time before... For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them; for no one can form a god which is like himself." 6 The text is that of the Loeb edition in Petronius, trans. Michael Heseltine, London: William Heinemann Ltd., 1930, 342. He translates as follows (343):</page><page sequence="3">PASCAL'S PENSÉES 65 As is common elsewhere in the Pensées - when using Montaigne, for example - Pascal adapts and compresses his sources in order to make them more concise and striking. Such, it seems, is the case here as well. Considered literally, the line by Petronius seems at least as likely to be a source for Pascal as the source indicated by Brunsch- vicg. As already stated, no editor that I have checked gives any other source than the one indicated by Brunschvicg. The only article that I have been able to find that throws some light on the question is the "Pétrone au moyen âge et dans la littérature française" by Albert Collignon.7 In the article of 1893, p. 67, one reads (emphasis mine): On trouve dans Pascal (Pensées, art. VII, 28, édit. Havet) une citation de Pétrone: "Plus poetice quam humane locutus es" (ch. 90). La phrase, ainsi que le fait remarquer M. Havet, n'a pas le même sens dans Pétrone que dans Pascal, qui aura sans doute emprunté à quelqu'un cette citation. Car nulle part ailleurs chez lui ne se rencontre la moindre allusion à Pétrone. Yet the similarity between Pascal's Latin phrase and the line of Petronius' poem prompts one to question this last statement. To a certain extent, Collignon is justified in his conclusion, as the Latin phrase 755-258 is not included in Havet's edition,8 which was published in 1852. 9 This latter text was the one used, appar- It was fear first created gods in the world, when the lightning fell from high heaven, and the ramparts of the world were rent with flame, and Athos was smitten and blazed. Soon 'twas Phoebus sank to earth, after he had traversed earth from his rising; the Moon grew old and once more renewed her glory; next the starry signs were spread through the firmament, and the year divided into changing seasons. The folly spread, and soon vain superstition bade the labourer yield to Ceres the harvest's chosen firstfruits, and garland Bacchus with the fruitful vine, and made Pales to rejoice in the shepherd's work; Neptune swims deep-plunged beneath all the waters of the world, Pallas watches over shops, and the man who wins his prayer or has betrayed the world for gold now strives greedily to create gods of his own. (emphasis mine) 7 This article was published in the Annales de l'Est, vol. 7, 1893, and expanded later by the author into a book, Pétrone en France (Paris: Albert Fontemoing, 1905). 8 According to the table de concordance set up by G. Michaut at the end of his edition of Pascal's Pensées (Fribouig, 1896), fragment no. 755-258 is omitted from the following editions: Port-Royal, Bossut, Havet, Molinier. The fragment no. 755 Lafuma-258 Brunschvicg = no. 463 in Michaut's edition. 9 Ernest Havet, Pensées de Pascal (Paris: Dezobry et Magdeleine, 1852).</page><page sequence="4">66 ROMANCE NOTES rently, by Collignon. One finds, however, an earlier edition which does include the Latin sentence in question, the edition of the Pensées prepared by Prosper Faugère and published in 1844. In this edition, Faugère placed our fragment no. 755-258 at the end of his text under the heading "Citations isolées." 10 Collignon adapted and expanded his article into a book, published in 1905, without chang- ing his opinion on Pascal's use of Petronius. Either he was unaware of Faugère's edition and Brunschvicg's recent work, or else he felt that he still had no reason to change his opinion. 11 Collignon's work is useful, however, in showing how important and widespread the works of Petronius were in seventeenth-century classical France. Balzac quotes him several times, Voiture and Sarrasin knew his writings, Racine quotes Petronius in his corre- spondence and, more to the point insofar as Pascal is concerned, Petronius was known to the Messieurs de Port-Royal , who used him in their Epigrammatum delectus , and to the Chevalier de Méré and the wide circle of the libertins. 12 Pascal's acquaintance with Pe- tronius is most likely through these intermediaries. There remains the possibility of another intermediary between Pascal and Petronius, namely Montaigne. This is proposed by Prosper Faugère, already mentioned, who justifies his grouping of our no. 755-258 in his "Citations isolées" as follows: Nous publions ces notes qui, séparées de la pensée de Pascal, n'ont d'ailleurs aucun intérêt, afin d'être rigoureusement fidèle à notre plan de publier sans exception tout ce que renferme le Ms. autographe ou la Copie. La plupart de ces citations ont très-vraisemblablement été prises par Pascal dans Montaigne qui faisait le plus gros de son érudition. 13 10 Prosper Faugère, Pensées, fragments et lettres de Biaise Pascal, vol. 2 (Paris: Andrieux, Editeur, 1844), p. 403. 11 It is interesting that Collignon quotes a Latin letter of 1587 which contains a direct reference to Petronius' line "iam sibi quisque..." See his article, pp. 60-61. Petronius' line was likely common currency in the scholarly world of the sixteenth century. In his article, Collignon gives as author of this letter Pierre Pithou, one of the coauthors of the Satyre Ménippée and himself one of the early, major, editors of Petronius' text; yet in his book, he cites as author of this letter not Pierre Pithou but his brother, François. I have not been able to verify whether this is a correction or not. 12 Collignon (1905), 46-52. 13 Faugère 402.</page><page sequence="5">PASCAL'S PENSÉES 67 We are today far from the editorial claim - or arrogance - that these passages "n'ont d'ailleurs aucun intérêt." Yet Faugère's last com- ment, if slighting, remains a possibility, although unexplored by him. Does this Latin sentence come from Montaigne? My own checking of the Latin quotes in Montaigne indicates no, although several Latin quotations come close to Pascal's wording. 14 Yet as soon as one consults the use of "forger" (the closest French equiv- alent to fingere ) by Montaigne in the French text, one finds several examples of French sentences that closely parallel Pascal's own Latin sentence. The three examples that seem to come closest to Pascal's text are as follows: 1. Il ne sçauroit foiļger un ciron, et forge des Dieux à douzaines. (II, 12, p. 530) 2. Non seulement fausses, mais impies aussi et injurieuses sont [les fausses images de nos songes] que l'homme a forgé de son invention. (II, 12, p. 513) 3. ... si les animaux se forgent des dieus... (II, 12, p. 532) These three examples - there are others, less closely connected with Pascal's Latin sentence15 -are taken, significantly enough, from essay no. 12 of Book II, the "Apologie de Raymond Sebond," an essay that is concerned with, among other things, a critique of anthropomorphism in theological language. Montaigne mocks the "bastelage de deifications anciennes" (529) and pities the fact that "nous nous pipons de nos propres singeries et inventions, Quod finxere, timent" ( 530). This last Latin quotation, from Lucan 1, 486, brings us full circle, back to the theme of Petronius' fragment 14 1. Maxima quae vidit quisque, haec ingentia fingit, Lucr. VI, 674 (I, 27, p. 180) 2. Sapiens pol ipse fingit fortunám sibi, Pļautus, Trinummus, II ii, 84 (I, 42, p. 260) 3. unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scientiae vi, Seneca, Svasoriae, IV (II, 12, p. 511) All references to Montaigne's text are to Pierre Villey, ed., Les Essais de Montaigne, 2 vols., 1924. Rééditée et avec une préface de V.-L. Saulnier (Paris: Presses Universi- taires de France, 1965). Numbers given at the end of the quotations of Montaigne give, respectively, book, chapter and page numbers. I have also included the reference, as given by Villey, to Montaigne's Latin source. 15 See the Concordance des Essais de Montaigne, vol. 1 (Genève, Librairie Droz, 1981), 542, for other French examples using the word "forger."</page><page sequence="6">68 ROMANCE NOTES no. xxvii. This text is, in itself, anti-religious in its attempt to explain by purely natural means what others take to be divine phenomena. This theme is common in antiquity, in the allegorical interpretations of the Homeric gods, for example, and is a recurring question throughout religious history: nature or supernature? human fiction or divine reality? With these questions in mind, the fragment 755-258 can be read in conjunction with two others that belong to the same group of "pensées" - Lafuma's série xxvi 16 -and that contain a reference to "fausses religions." In fragments 734-817 and 735-818, Pascal argues that the multiplicity of religions is not simply due to "imposture" and therefore a proof that all religions are false, but rather that no one would believe so many religions if none had been true: some - or one -must therefore be true. The multiplicity of human beliefs becomes, for Pascal, the proof of the necessity of the existence of one true religion. The pagan Petronius would have been, like the Jews who refuse to see in Christ the Son of God (see fragment 593-760) another of the "témoins sans reproche" for the truth of Christianity. This interpretation is based on the Latin sentence only and not on a reading of the word "le dégoût" which follows it in the editions of Pascal's text. If we read the Latin sentence in conjunction with the French "le dégoût" - something that is not to be taken for granted, although most modern editors imply such a reading by their arrange- ment of the text17 -then Pascal is using Petronius' statement to 16 For J. Mesnard, Lafuma's Série XXVI is a "unité complexe." Mesnard prefers the word "unité" in describing the "liasses" of the second part of the Pensées (i.e. all fragments after fragment no. 382-287), to Lafuma's term "série." For Mesnard, Lafuma's description of the second part of the Pensées as "Papiers non-classés" is inappropriate: the word "unité" better conveys the idea that the second half includes "des unités non moins rigoureusement délimitées que la première et dont beaucoup sont aussi des liasses." (J. Mesnard, Les Pensées de Pascal, Paris: S.E.D.E.S., 1976, p. 29.) Following Mesnard's suggestion, one can see a certain unity in theme between fragments 755-258 and 734-817, 735-818. 17 Cf. the following remark by Brunschvicg: "Si nous interprétons bien ce mot isolé [i.e. "le dégoût "], ce serait un résumé énergique du fragment suivant [i.e. 815-259, where Pascal speaks of "fausses religions"]. Les fausses religions, les dieux fabriqués dégoûtent les bons esprits" in Biaise Pascal, Pensées et opuscules, ed. L. Brunschvicg (Paris: Hachette, 1959), p. 452. In other words, Brunschvicg reads "le dégoût" in conjunction with his no. 259, not his 258 (our 755-258). As he says, the word is "isolé." In the original manuscript, the Latin phrase is in Pascal's own, nearly</page><page sequence="7">PASCAL'S PENSÉES 69 provoke a feeling of "disgust" in the reader who is searching for substantial truth. Such a procedure is common in Pascal's argumen- tation. "Mahomet" can be "ridicule" (218-598), Montaigne's project of depicting himself is "sot" (780-62); the ideal of justice proposed by Epictetus is a "niaiserie" (100-467), etc. This is a form of a rhetorical rejectio whereby other witnesses and judges of morality are "rejected" outright by Pascal, defender of the Christian faith. In conclusion then, Brunschvicg's source should be completed by reference to Montaigne and to Petronius. We can then read fragment no. 755-258 in a more complete literary context, a context stretching back to antiquity and against which Pascal had to write. In the end, what counts is not whether Pascal himself "thought" this "thought" before anyone else, originally. Rather, the originality of Pascal is an originality of tactical arrangement, or "disposition": "Qu'on ne dise pas que je n'ai rien dit de nouveau, la disposition des matières est nouvelle..." (692-22). It is this disposition nouvelle in Pascal's writing which seeks to effect a new disposition in the heart of Pascal's reader. Colgate University indecipherable handwriting; there follows a pen-stroke - which commonly marks elsewhere a new pensée or a new paragraph of the same pensée. Then we have the word "le de gou" (sic), but not in Pascal's own handwriting. Should they be read separately? Or did Pascal dictate this addition to his own Latin sentence? What seems to authorize reading the two together is the fact that both occupy the same piece of paper that was used by Louis Périer to form the Recueil Original. Instead of separating the two phrases, Périer left them together when cutting up and gluing together Pascal's papers (in order to make them fit the supporting paper used in the preparation of the Recueil Original). See J. Mesnard, Les Pensées de Pascal, 15.</page></plain_text>
