Clark Howell Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies/Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 Human evolutionary studies exist in their own right due to our own anthropocentricity, but particularly through developments within the natural sciences. The emergence of an autono- mous evolutionary biology has largely engulfed human evolutionary studies. Most perspec- tives of earlier workers are inexplicit in regard to phylogenetic inference, taxonomic resolu- tion, process, pattern, tempo, and other aspects of hominin evolution, and thus are archaic, irrelevant, or both. Matters of epistemology have scarcely merited explicit, critical consider- ation; even inference as to the best explanation (abduction) has rarely been employed, or employed consistently. Human populations, their genic structure, variability, affinities and histories are now elu- cidated and directly quantified through molecular biology and population genetics. Past hominin populations are increasingly composed of samples necessary and sufficient to characterize paleo-demes (p-demes) and, ultimately, species clades representative of spatio-temporally bounded entities, the nature and affinities of which are informed through functional, cladistic, and morphometrical investigation. Diverse aspects of earlier hominin habitats, distributions, adaptations, and behavioral parameters are increasingly revealed through multifaceted ap- proaches, all within the framework of paleoanthropology and focused on fuller recovery and elucidation of the Pleistocene archaeological record. Here, some central aspects of Pleistocene hominin evolution are broadly set out from such perspectives. Controversial issues exist, of course, but overall are secondary, in view of the prevalence of normal scientific practice. THE STUDY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION is a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary endeavor. Its essential focus is on the comprehension, elucidation, and explication of the biological and behavioral evolution of humankind. Consequently, central con- cerns are processes, circumstances, situations, and events. It is of necessity a historical endeavor; however, as that past is pre-historical, it relies extensively on approaches and methodologies characteristic both of the natural sciences and of prehistoric archaeology, which can provide insights to past human dis- tributions, adaptations, and (hopefully) behaviors. The basic facts of the past are not readily apparent; they require discovery, recognition, description, comparison, and analysis within the paradigm of mod- ern evolutionary biology and by means of anthropological concepts of culture. Facts elicit questions, questions are posed, explanations (hypotheses) are for- mulated in respect to questions, further relevant data are sought/collected bear- ing on those formulations, correspondences and patterns are sought, hypoth- eses are tested (often mathematically), and outcome(s) are interpreted within Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 55, 1999 Copyright ? by The University of New Mexico 191</page><page sequence="2">192 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH an appropriate theoretical framework. The extent to which theory is developed, and is appropriate and capable of empirical validation, is both central and critical to the positive, coherent, and fruitful outcome of this process. Consilience, in the sense of William Whewell, must obtain in respect to the incorporation of generali- zations ("laws" in some disciplines) into a more inclusive theory. Scientific progress is reflected in the demonstrable and accepted success of such endeavors. Following J.A. Moore (1993), the fundamental criteria that characterize ac- tivities within the framework of science are (after E. Mayr 1997): 1. Science must be based on data collected in the field or laboratory by observation or experiment, without invoking supernatural factors. 2. Data are collected to permit answering questions, and observations are made to strengthen or refute conjectures. 3. Objective methods are employed in order to minimize any possible bias. 4. Hypotheses must be consistent with the observations and must be compatible with the general conceptual framework. 5. All hypotheses must be tested, and, if possible, competing hypoth- eses must be developed and their degree of validity (problem-solving capacity) compared. 6. Generalizations must be universally valid within the domain of the particular science. Unique events must be explicable without invok- ing supernatural factors. 7. In order to eliminate the possibility of error, a fact or discovery is fully accepted only if (repeatedly) confirmed by other investigators. 8. Science is characterized by the steady improvement of scientific theo- ries, by the replacement of faulty or incomplete theories, and by the solution of previously puzzling problems. The reality that affairs and records of the past are both ephemeral and finite imposes a particular burden on the collection of data and evaluation of unique- ness through replication of repetitive instances and even places limitations on incorporation of past data sets obtained under accidental, serendipitous, or less- than-scientific circumstances. The past is expectantly viewed within a frame- work of uniformitarianism, which, due to the limitations of the knowable "now," inhibits recognition of diversity and difference in the unknown, even unen- visioned, "then." Adherence to a strict concept of uniformitarianism may well obscure the existence and recognition of anomalies, an important aspect of the process of scientific investigation. Such constraints may have serious episte- mological consequences. The development and practice of "middle-range theory" and intensified concerns with manifold aspects of taphonomy are out- comes of problems especially attendant upon studies of the past. The uniformi- tarian perspective considers the present (in terms of processes) as the key to the past. However, in an evolutionary perspective and a necessarily historical- narrative approach, the past is indeed a unique key to the present. My purpose here is to set out briefly some essential, altered perspectives on</page><page sequence="3">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 193 human evolutionary studies. These perspectives derive in part from the endeav- ors of evolutionary biology and revolutionary developments in molecular biology and theoretical population genetics. In addition, the direct documentation of the human past, both the fossil record and the archaeological documentation of past human activities, has recently been enhanced substantially and sometimes pro- foundly. I, like others, consider that such developments powerfully impact the practice of this field of science, thus affecting both traditional historical attitudes and some unsustainable theoretical positions doggedly adhered to by a few prac- titioners in spite of such advances. However, the handwriting is clearly on the wall as to how inappropriate and insupportable some such perspectives and posi- tions are and how requisite their abandonment is to fruitful progress in the field. I focus attention here on three topics of central interest to human evolution- ary studies: first, the nature and scope of modem human diversity and the evidence it affords as to the source and temporal depth of modern humans; second, the question of the initial peopling of Eurasia and its implications for subsequent diversification, adaptation, and extinction(s) among Pleistocene humankind; and, third, the present status of the modem human origins debate in respect to the preceding topics and the current understanding of the rel- evant human paleontological and archaeological record. MODERN HUMAN DIVERSITY Nowadays human diversity is increasingly all around us. Human isolation, par- tial and even complete in some instances, has been essential to the origin and maintenance of diversity. It has, on occasions and over time, been compromised and violated through range extension, population expansion, dispersals, migra- tions, invasions, colonization events, and, of course, slavery. It is nearly impos- sible, in spite of much historical documentation, to reconstitute the former iden- tity and distribution of many population units, although most major and some minor population aggregates and lesser entities are discernible and variously well known. Often the time of European contact is employed as a temporal baseline for an approximation of population integrity. That baseline is far from appropri- ate or informative in view of extensive archaeological and linguistic documenta- tion of often extensive population transformations since the late Pleistocene. Traditionally human differences were categorized typologically largely on the basis of a few or several phenotypic characteristics and thereby delineated as a few racial stocks or some such entities. Fuller delineation based on a con- sideration of population genetics and the recognition of variability has mark- edly altered past, static conceptualizations. Populations and their aggregates are much more fluid, more ephemeral, and less strictly bounded than once envisioned, and process plays a large role in modern studies. Human populations are generally differentiated at the subspecies or race level (both informal taxonomic categories). Subspecies are an "aggregate of local populations of a species inhabiting a geographic subdivision of the range of the species and differing taxonomically from other populations of the spe-</page><page sequence="4">194 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH cies" (Mayr and Ashlock 1991:420), whereas race constitutes "local popula- tions not sufficiently different to be formally recognized as subspecies" (Mayr and Ashlock 1991:427). This terminology is approximately coextensive with the designations of geographic races and local races often employed in biologi- cal anthropology (Garn 1965). Thus, the characterizations of the recent human condition: "breeding population(s) characterized by frequencies of a collection of inherited traits that differ from those of other populations of the same spe- cies" (R.A. Goldsby 1971:21) and "in terms of biological variation, a group of populations sharing certain traits that make them distinct from other groups of populations" (J.H. Relethford 1994b:540). A minimum of nine or ten principal geographic aggregates and over thirty local breeding units, often maintained by either natural or social barriers to gene interchange, a breeding population sharing "a common history, and a com- mon locale" (Garn 1965:6), have commonly been delimited among the human species. This purported composition might be contrasted with that of a well- known, wide-ranging (Africa and Eurasia) carnivore, Felis silvestris (wild cat), among which some fifteen subspecies are customarily recognized. Such subspecific categories are characterized in five major aspects-geographic, historical, adaptive, phenotypic, and genotypic. These are interlinked such that the last (genotypic) is illuminative of all the others. Developments in molecular biology now enable direct study of the human genome and thus offer insight, heretofore inconceivable, into the evolutionary status of such fundamental units. All genes have ancestors, and thus genetics is the key to the past. Unlike the races of most other mammal species, human populations have patterns of distribution and of structure that often fail to exhibit marked discontinuities: [A]lmost without exception, gene frequencies form smooth clines over all continents. Zones of discontinuity in human gene frequency distribu- tions are present, but the local gradients are so small that they can be identified only by simultaneously studying many loci using complex sta- tistical techniques. ... such regions of relatively sharp genetic change do not surround large clusters of populations, on a continental or nearly con- tinental scale.... they occur irregularly, within continents and even within single countries, often overlapping with geographic and linguistic barri- ers. Genetic enclaves seem to be mostly limited to islands.... [Whereas] several variances among populations, although low in relative terms, are statistically significant, ... this has little to do with the subdivision of the human population into a small number of clearly distinct, racial or conti- nental groups. The existence of such broad groups is not supported by the present analysis of DNA. (Barbujani et al. 1997:4518) Even with the present limited sample sizes, . . . study shows that previ- ous finds of large individual diversity within populations were not due to the particular nature of the marker chosen, normally frequencies of pro-</page><page sequence="5">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 195 tein variants at biallelic loci. Microsatellite loci are among the most poly- morphic in the genome, yet they yield variance estimates in excellent agreement with the previous ones and with variances estimated from other DNA markers. (Barbujani et al. 1997:4518) The "classical" genetic polymorphisms (autosomal markers) have long been employed to examine gene frequencies and human population variabilities and affinities. These markers comprise blood groups, serum proteins and enzymes, protein antigens, immunoglobins, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA/MHC) complex. These are among the some 100,000 genes making up the human genome. The nature and scope of this evidence is tabulated in Human Poly- morphic Genes: World Distribution (Nei and Roychoudhury 1988). The most extensive analysis of geographic patterns of genetic variation is The History and Geography of Human Genes (Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi, and Piazza 1994, abridged edition 1996), which affords 518 synthetic gene frequency maps at the continental and lesser level, utilizing larger Principal Components Analy- sis. The basic data source, drawn from larger sets, comprises 128 alleles from 491 global populations (and 116 aggregated populations); in-depth analysis fo- cuses on 42 populations worldwide. Scarcely an aspect of human population distribution, variability, affinity, and evolutionary history is not now elucidated through these remarkable analyses and attendant comparisons and syntheses. The direct study of chromosomal DNA and its nucleotide units permits analy- sis at the molecular level, accurate documentation of allelic diversity, study of the history of mutation, and close estimation of degrees of resemblance and di- vergence among populations. The human genome comprises some 3,000 million nucleotide pairs in all. The nuclei of 22 autosomes comprise nDNA, whereas the Y-chromosome affords Y-DNA. mtDNA obtains in the mitochondria, a metabolic organelle, within the female cellular cytoplasm. mtDNA and Y-DNA are haploid, uniparentally transmitted (through female and male, respectively), and do not undergo recombination. The former is small, with only some 16,569 base pairs; it lacks both introns and functionless ("junk") DNA and is thus unlike nDNA. In mtDNA, the displacement loop segment, lacking functional genes, experiences rapid mutational changes and is thus a major focus of analysis. Overall, mtDNA undergoes and accumulates mutations at some ten times the rate of nDNA; it also lacks requisite enzymes to effect mutational corrections. The polymorphisms largely employed in nDNA and other analyses are: 1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms-reflect losses or additions or replace- ments; include the several million known biallelic markers; highly stable. 2. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms-particular short set(s) of bases recognized (and cut) by a restriction enzyme; an aspect of restriction site polymorphisms; highly stable. 3. Short tandem repeat polymorphisms-all more rapidly evolving elements: (a) Microsatellite polymorphisms-repeats of very short, usually 6 or less, nucleotide sequences; have high addition/loss rates.</page><page sequence="6">196 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (b) Minisatellite polymorphisms-less common; some 1,500 haploid loci or more, and sequences larger than microsatellites, of 10-50 nucleotides, some 0.5-40 kb in extent. (c) Alu (retroposon) insertion polymorphisms-short, interspersed repetitive elements, -300 bp, and some 0.5-1.0 million within hu- man genome; ancestral state known (once absent) and unique in positional aspect of insertion; stable, as deletion rarely occurs. Homo sapiens exhibits substantially less genetic and phenotypic diversity overall than do many other mammalian, including primate, species. There is also much greater genetic diversity within human populations (85-87 percent) than among populations (13-15 percent), as exemplified by both genetic poly- morphisms (classical markers, nDNA, etc.) and craniometrics. Sub-Saharan African populations consistently exhibit the greatest within-group population diversity, quite high diversity between populations, and the greatest genetic distance from extra-African populations (expressed in nDNA, mtDNA, and Y- DNA). They exhibit relatively weak linkage disequilibrium. Non-Africans con- sistently exhibit a subset of African haplotype variation. Thus they have a shared pattern of allelic association(s) and also stronger linkage disequilibrium (biallelic associations at proximate loci on chromosomes). Eurasia exhibits the next high- est diversity. The Pacific Islands and the Western Hemisphere have the low- est genetic diversity. These conditions are variously envisioned as reflecting either differences in population history (great African time depth and atten- dant enhanced accumulation of polymorphisms through mutation) and/or dif- ferences in population structure (long-term greater African population size), if not both. Among-group variation is often expressed by the Fst statistic (Table 1). Most investigators of human populations and their affinities consider that the total body of genetic evidence strongly supports an African source for the modern human species and its varied global components. The theory of the coalescent enables the presence and derivation of mutant alleles to be traced and hence allows us to ascertain the age of the ancestral condition. This procedure normally assumes a genetic model of neutrality and is dependent upon the rate of mutation. However, populations other than pan- mictic populations of fixed size may be modeled to include, for example, vari- able population size, geographic subdivision, and nonrandom mating. Such in- ferences derive most readily from mtDNA and Y-DNA, which are haploid, of strict maternal and paternal inheritance, respectively, lack recombination, and have high evolutionary rates. Long ill-known, the Y-chromosome has proved to have over 20 genes (or gene families) in its nonrecombining region. These relate not only to sperm production, but also to embryonic growth, stature, and dental development. Coalescence age estimates of mtDNA (Table 2) and of Y- DNA (Table 3) are broadly congruent and are also relatively young. Most val- ues are between 150 and 300 kya, and confidence intervals (95 percent) rarely reach or exceed 500 kya maximum. Rather than population divergence, such estimates reflect the time of genetic divergence (coalescence) reflected in poly-</page><page sequence="7">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 197 TABLE 1 Among-Group Variation (Fst) in Human Population Aggregates Samples (Author/Reference) Fst Male Female Craniometrics (Howells 1973, 1989) (N = 1,734 individuals) Europe + Asia + Africa 0.065 (0.001)a 0.076 (0.002)a 0.063 (0.002)a 0.017b Europe + Asia + Africa + Australia + 0.084 (0.001)a 0.093 (0.002)a 0.085 (0.002)a Polynesia + Americas 0.144b Classic polymorphisms Latter 1980 0.104 Ryman, Chakraborty, and Nei 1983 0.099 Av. 0.102 Nei and Roychoudhury 1982 Protein loci (N = 62) 0.088 Blood groups (N = 23) 0.109 Av. 0.099 Livshits and Nei 1990 Proteins/enzymes (N = 86); blood groups (N = 33) 0.114 DNA mtDNA (Takahata 1993) 0.097 (0.078-0.115) Y-chromosome (Poloni et al. 1997) Global (N = 58) (h = 126) 0.230** Indo-European (N = 22) (h = 75) 0.071* Afro-Asiatic (N = 29) (h = 62) 0.085** African, Niger-Congo (N = 18) (h = 34) 0.039** African, Khoisan (N = 22) (h = 11) 0. 129* Y-chromosome (Hammer, Spurdle, et al. 1997) Global (N = 60) 0.32 nDNA polymorphisms (Bowcock et al. 1991) Global (N = 5) 0.139 Microsatellites (Deka et al. 1995) 0.11 Global (N = 8) Source: After Relethford 1994a in part Note: h = haplotype a.

In some ancient genetic loci (such as HLA complex, 8-globins, etc.), larger population aggregates are both expected and evidenced. It has long been noticed that a fair association exists between linguistic and genetic distances. Diverse studies worldwide consistently demonstrate this congruence, most particularly through comparison of an evolutionary tree of the genetic distances of over 40 populations with 16 major linguistic phyla and superphyla. Overall the agreement is substantial. There are, however, some notable exceptions in particular isolates, as in highland New Guinea and among several American Indian groups. The language/genetic relationship is approached from either of two perspec- tives-historical or geographical. In the first instance, a common language is considered indicative of a common biological origin and, if a related language, then a common origin farther removed in time. In the second instance, the goal is to examine an isolation-by-distance hypothesis, since genetic resemblances of isolates usually decrease fairly continuously with distance. Abruptness of genetic variation is indicative of isolating factors (whether natural, sociocul- tural, or linguistic), and coincident overlapping zones of enhanced genetic and linguistic change suggest language functions as an obstacle to reproduction. Within greater Europe, defined (constant size) areas exhibit enhanced genetic variability when they are traversed by language boundaries, such that among genetic loci, over half differ more among, rather than within, language families. It is noteworthy that nearly all (31 of 33) such zones of genetic change are coincident with linguistic boundaries. The effects of population expansions, including migration and colonization, are particularly exemplified by Principal Components Analysis of the distribu- TABLE 4 Effective Population Size (Ne) Estimates from Genetic Polymorphisms Author/Reference Ne nDNA Sherry et al. 1997a, 1997b (Alu-insertions) - 26,000 Zietkiewicz et al. 1997, 1998 - 11,200 (6,100-16,200) Takahata 1993 (divers) 10,000 Harding et al. 1997 (P-globin) 10,000 Relethford and Harpending 1994 (divers) 10,000 mtDNA Wilson et al. 1985 12,000 Cavalli-Sforza 1998 10,000 (up to 100,000) Proteins Nei and Graur 1984 10,000 MHC (HLA) complex Bergstr6m et al. 1998 (also Takahata and Satta 1998) 10,000</page><page sequence="10">200 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH tion of "classical" polymorphisms in Europe. The components (and their per- centage contribution) of such analysis elucidate the successive effects of (1) Neolithic agricultural expansion some 9,500 years ago and subsequently (28 percent), (2) probable dispersion of Uralic speakers (22 percent), (3) disper- sion of Bronze Age pastoral nomads of the Don-Volga area some 5,000 years ago (11 percent), and (4) the effects of Greek colonial expansion about 1,000 B.C. (7 percent). Europe has the next greatest nDNA diversity after Africa. On the other hand, European populations, other than the Saami (Lapps), display marked homogeneity in respect to mtDNA, a reflection of their relative recency. The extension of analysis (again, of classical markers within 13 populations, but employing spatial autocorrelation) to broadly include western (European) and eastern (south Asian) Indo-Europeans, Altaics (central Asia, Turkestan), and Elamo-Dravidians (Iran, Indo-Pakistan) reveals again the clinal effects of Neolithic demic diffusion (NDD). Hence, such patterning is reflective of a single, broad-based dispersal phenomenon, involving a concatenation of geographic (genetic), linguistic, and subsistence (agricultural) factors, undoubtedly linked as well with admixture, and leading to the spatial structuring of allelic frequen- cies and the substantial differences exhibited at linguistic boundaries. These linguistic groups and those of the Afro-Asiatic family together comprise (for some scholars) the Nostratic macrofamily. There is not the same evidence for NDD effects on the Afro-Asiatic populations, which are autochthonous to much of northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula and are often considered to be of African origin; among them, clinal gradients are both less marked and less com- mon. This Afro-Asiatic language family is also considered by scholars to have its roots in the late Upper Pleistocene and hence to be earlier derived than other, related families. The separate or conjoint application of Y-DNA and mtDNA analysis also bears on these problems. A comparative basis is afforded by abundant samples (58 of 73 globally) of the former, yielding 126 haplotypes, and a matching diverse (subset) sample of both. Similar results to those from classical markers and nDNA obtain. On the basis of genetic distance (Fst) values, some estimations of the time of splitting of language families (populations) are obtained (in years): within Nostratic, Indo-European -7,400 (Fst = 0.071) and Afro-Asiatic -8,900 (Fst = 0.085); within Niger-Congo-Kordofanian, -4,000 (Ft, = 0.039); and pur- portedly (as a constant, restricted population is projected), for Khoisan -1,400 (Fs, = 0.129). This last is surely a substantial underestimate, as the group is characterized by relatively high genetic diversity and had a much broader an- cient distribution; hence, there was presumably a greater population size, and, if so, a greater time would be required to attain such diversity. Microsatellite analysis of continental East Asian populations demonstrates levels of differentiation despite their overall purported homogeneity. There is differentiation between northern and southern populations, the latter being more heterogeneous, and minorities are linked with aboriginal Taiwanese and the former with Han speakers. The last also incorporates Japanese, Korean, and samples of Altaic speakers. Four East Asian major lineages contrast with</page><page sequence="11">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 201 the proximate Native American outgroup. Such analysis leaves unclear the process of differentiation among such Asian populations and those of south- eastern and central Asia (the latter almost unstudied). However, analysis ar- gues against an independent origin of "sapiens" Asians and recognizes that the root of the East Asian gene pool in major part derived ultimately from an allochthonous African source. The Sahulian region, once more extensive, now comprises the isolated land masses of Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea. The flooding of the shelf and attendant isolation were terminal or post-Pleistocene phenomena. This region's indigenous human inhabitants, once immigrant from continental Asia-pre- sumably via Sundaland-share a poorly defined but unquestionable kinship. They exhibit definite genetic affinities in comparison to other continental popu- lations, and some suggestive genetic linkages with mainland Asia have been discerned. In both Australia and New Guinea, there are numerous population isolates, separated by cultural and/or geographic barriers. This continental area exhibits a remarkable proliferation of languages. F,, values for classical poly- morphisms are lower in New Guinea (0.050) than in Australia (0.066), although data are admittedly limited. Various genetic studies on such populations yield puzzling, varied outcomes. Thus, mtDNA analysis has revealed very low vari- ability, but substantial differentiation between individual regional populations, and has shown no particularly close relationship between haplotype lineages of either population set. There appears to be little or no sharing in respect to the HLA complex. However, studies of nDNA (cx-globin, B-globin, microsatellites, Alu-inserts), classical polymorphisms, and Y-DNA reveal definite affinities, al- though in some instances not close ones. In general, this situation suggests only a few (and different) founding lineages, perhaps in association with bottle- neck effect(s) and subsequent variable subpopulation differentiation through isolation and drift of many particular haplotypes among groups. Among nDNA polymorphisms, joint sharing of the ancestral haplotype state with that of Afri- cans is apparent. This affords some evidence that the primary colonization of a greatly expanded peninsular/insular southeastern Asia involved a distinct, ex- tra-African dispersal through southern Asia. Aside from insight into the mutational history, geographic distribution, and populational variabilities of genetic polymorphisms, such investigations afford windows into the human past. Y-DNA and mtDNA delineate coalescent roots stretching back into the Middle Pleistocene, some 200-400 kya, unequivocally demonstrating a relatively recent origin for Homo sapiens. These polymorphisms, and other systems, also indicate a delimited area, rather than a pan-continental distribution, for such antecedents, including a demographic structure of quite severely limited size (Ne -10,000). The distribution, patterning, and apportion- ment of such diversity indicate Africa to have been the primary center of origin. Theories of sapiens origins (Table 5), including so-called Multiregionalism, which involve much deeper (Lower Pleistocene) temporal, pan-continental populational distributions and substantial, even approaching panmictic, gene flow receive no support from the new outcomes of these investigations.</page><page sequence="12">202 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH TABLE 5 Contrastive Aspects of Multiregional (MRE) and Single Origin/Dispersal (RAD) Models/Scenarios in Hominin Evolution Evolutionary Framework Components/Conditions Multiregionalism Single Origin/Dispersal Evolutionary mode(s) Anagenesis Cladogenesis Taxonomic status Single species Multiple species, extinctions, re-/dis-placement(s) Population(s)/structure Quasi-panmictic, with isolation Small, disjunctive demes, by distance semi-isolated to isolated Ne Large, &gt; 10" Small, &gt; 101 Demographic parameters Large, &gt; 105-106 Small, 1C4-105 No (?) bottleneck(s) Bottleneck(s) = 100-50 kya (Hourglass structure) Rapid expansions (Bud vase structure) Gene flow model(s) Migration/exchange Enhanced genetic drift Maintains homogeneity within species Geographic distribution Supra-regional (widespread) Discontinuous, patchy Old World tropics and Restricted, subcontinental temperate regions zone Natural selection Strong role re advantageous genes Targeted selection Balanced against drift Drift enhanced Extant genetic and phenotypic Very substantial Relatively minor variation Coalescence (root), especially Deep, &gt; 10' Relatively shallow, mtDNA 2-4 x 105 ASPECTS OF THE HOMININ FOSSIL RECORD In recent years investigators have confronted anew the issue of species and clades in the hominin fossil record. The difficulty of employing the otherwise broadly accepted and widely employed biological species concept in paleobiology is commonly acknowledged. Some version of a phylogenetic (evolutionary) spe- cies concept is frequently proposed toward resolution of this issue. Such might include E.O. Wiley's (1978:18, also 1981:25) reformulation of G.G. Simpson's evolutionary species concept as "a lineage of ancestral-descendant populations which maintains its identity from other such lineages and which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate" (essentially a biological species concept, invoking reproductive continuity/individuality through time). The lin- eage is construed by Wiley (1978: 18, also 1981:25) as "one or a series of demes that share a common history of descent not shared by other demes." The phylo- genetic species concept (of Eldredge and Cracraft 1980:92; also Cracraft</page><page sequence="13">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 203 1983:170, 1989:35) is considered "an irreducible (basal) cluster of organisms diagnostically distinct from other such clusters, and within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent." Operationally, this implies diagnos- tic, heritable character(s) and reproductive cohesion within clusters (demes or related larger aggregates). The critical component in most such delineations is the deme, considered "as the unit of natural history and of evolutionary divergence," and defined as "a communal interbreeding population within a species" (Carter 1951:142), or, following Mayr and Ashlock (1991:413), "a local population of a species; the community of potentially interbreeding individuals at a given locality." The term was introduced by Gilmour and Gregor (1939:333; see also in Gilmour and Heslop-Harrison 1954) for a local interbreeding population or community ("any assemblage of taxonomically closely related individuals") which is dis- tinguishable by reproductive (genetic), geographic, and ecological (habitat) parameters. A comparable and appropriate term, following J. Damuth (1985:1137), is avatar(s), comprising "groups of organisms of a single species in a single geographically restricted community." Together, demes (sometimes as isolates) constitute subspecies. It is well known that innumerable workers concerned with hominin paleon- tology have been notoriously imprecise in their usages, often skipping confus- ingly between what are, in fact, distinct entities and concepts. Simpson (1963, also 1961) made important distinctions in respect to the language employed in taxonomy and different designative words and their kinds, with particular re- gard to processes, name sets, and referents. In reference to hominin evolu- tionary studies, he especially noted that "one of the greatest linguistic needs in this field is for clear, uniform, and distinct sets of N, and N2 designations, applied to specimens and to local populations as distinct from taxa" (Simpson 1963:4). The specification of different name sets (N) is requisite and manda- tory for any measure of consistency and progress in this endeavor. Following Simpson, the essential distinctions are: N, = specimen designation (locality name, repository/catalogue numbers; = hypodigm-1); N2 = group designations, population (paleocommunity, or p-deme in the author's sense) designation, reflecting inclusive genealogically related geographic group(s) (= hypodigm- 2); N3 = formal nomen or taxon, composed of N2 hypodigms as drawn from and representative of subspecific and specific taxa (= hypodigm-3); N4 = ranking designation, categorization within a hierarchic (Linnaean) classification. It should be stressed, of course, that the single (N,) type, referring to a chosen holotype or, failing that, a subsequently designated lectotype, functions as a name bearer (of Simpson's one-time usage) for a particular biological entity. It is not, and cannot function as, reflective of a full or inclusive spectrum of character states or their variations, and so on. However, N2 designations are indeed revelatory in those respects. I consider that the N2 designation is greatly undervalued and underemployed; yet as Simpson (1963:2) states, "it is often necessary to recog- nize and designate a local population that is a part of a taxon but does not in itself comprise a whole taxon," and, thus, "for some populations a different set</page><page sequence="14">204 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH of names or symbols, N2, may therefore be required." In the fossil record, such entities exhibit spatio-temporal boundedness. Elsewhere (Howell 1996) I put forth the suggestion that the recognition of paleo-demes (p-demes) is both appropriate and necessary in studies of the hominin fossil record at various levels. This step groups in association remains of proxi- mate geographic distribution and closely similar age, at a level between that of the individual specimen(s) and a higher taxonomic category. It tends to amelio- rate a typological tendency inevitably arising from close analysis of individual example(s). Such p-demic samples are the basic stuff of the hominin fossil record. Trinkaus (1990:9) has also considered that "the best approach... is probably one that regards the available fossil samples (or specimens) as representatives of prehistoric populations or lineages acting as portions of dynamic evolutionary units." A central problem has been, and remains, that of bridging the gap be- tween individual specimens and such p-demic samples to achieve an apprecia- tion of the subspecies and its variation. Finds from the earlier history of human paleontology, including types and/or less complete, fragmentary specimens, al- ways require reevaluation in the light of fuller information afforded by both more complete and numerous remains recovered subsequently. This obvious choice is not always sufficiently appreciated or adequately pursued (it is, however, com- mon practice in paleontology). After an early history and long persistence of species recognition and taxonomic splitting (Campbell 1965), human paleontol- ogy came to be dominated by an overriding concern with subspecies and con- comitant reluctance to confront the issue of species lineages. There is, of course, the further problem of delineation of species lineages on the basis of evidence afforded by p-demic samples. This is a common problem faced by paleontologists for generations, but one often evaded by students of the hominins, whose focus, traditionally, has been on individual finds. Upwards of twenty such p-demes are distinguishable within the immediate ancestry subsumed within Homo, exclusive of the hypodigms of H. habilis and H. rudolfensis taxa, which may or may not be appropriately attributed to Homo, and exclusive of, in the strict sense, Homo sapiens (the "anatomically modern" humans of authors). It is to such p-demes, or some members thereof, that much comparative and analytical study has been devoted, although the demic focus has not always, even often, been made sufficiently explicit. PALEO-DEMES: AN OVERVIEW Africa Nariokotome This p-deme is known exclusively, as yet, from sub-Saharan Africa. Fortunately there are three partial skeletons within this group: a subadult individual (WT-15000); another partial (pathological) skeleton (ER-1808); and the first discovered example, comprising associated cranial parts, mandible, and some fragmentary postcrania (ER-730). Adult crania (ER-3733, 3883) and mandibles, both adult (ER-730, ER- 992, the type of the nomen H. ergaster Groves and Mazik) and subadult (ER-820),</page><page sequence="15">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 205 are well represented; there are, as well, a number of referred and varied postcrania. Although there are no known immediate archaeological associations at the two dozen occurrences of such hominins within the Turkana basin, the same time span documents a diverse Karari variant of the Oldowan industry and substantial evi- dence of hominin carcass-processing activities. A representative of this group, com- prising a largely complete adult mandible with dentition, is also documented at Konso-Gardula (southern Ethiopia) at -1.5 mya, in horizon(s) yielding a rich early Acheulean industry. The few Olduvai H.15 dental remains from MNK-II possibly may also prove referable to this group. In eastern Africa, the age of this p-deme falls between - 1.70 and 1.5 mya (with one specimen as old as 1.88 mya) and has a known span of -210,000 years. This deme is probably also represented by a partial cranium (SK-847, etc.) at Swartkrans (Members 1 and 2). P. boisei in eastern Africa andP. crassidens in southern Africa are sympatric australopithecine taxa at all known localities and temporal intervals. It is now generally acknowledged that this p- deme constitutes the probable source for the initial extra-African hominin dispersal into the Eurasiatic realm. Hence, for now, it serves as the morphotype to which other p-demes of substantial Pleistocene antiquity must be compared. Olduvai/LLK-II The adult calvarium of Olduvai Hominid 9 (H.9), of rather uncertain strati- graphic provenance from LLK locality (but presumptively upper Bed II), is the principal specimen. It is the type of the nomen leakeyi Heberer. There is no direct archaeological association, although Acheulean assemblages are well known in these horizons. The most complete specimen reasonably assignable to this p- deme, that of a largely complete (if imperfect) adult cranium (UA-31) including the facial skeleton, derived from the Buia area, north Danakil depression (Eritrea). It is of broadly Jaramillo subchron age (-1 mya). Other very tentatively assign- able specimens are substantially younger in age. A smaller, only partial cranium (Olduvai H.12 from VEK-IVa) exhibits somewhat comparable morphology to Old. H.9. There are no known direct associations of mandibles and crania. However, three partial mandibles (right hemi-mandible with partial dentition, Old. H.22, VEK-IV; left mandible fragment H.51, GTC, Bed III/IV; and perhaps H.23, a left fragment, FLK, in situ in Masek Beds) are possible candidates for this p-deme. The last would have an approximate (extrapolated) age of some 0.85-0.60 mya. The only likely postcrania (ulna, innominate, and femoral diaphysis) may well be those of Old. H.36 (SC locality, IID Tuff) and Old. H.28 (WK-IVa). Conceivably some hominin materials from Melka-Kontoure (Ethiopia) may also prove to be assignable to this group. In known cranial morphology, this p-deme appears quite strongly derived by comparison with its antecedent, Nariokotome p-deme. Tighenif (Ternifine) This p-deme is, for now, recognizable only in the northwest African Maghreb. The cranium is unknown except for a parietal, whereas mandibles with denti- tion are well represented, as are some isolated teeth, all from the eponymous locality. An immediate association with the Acheulean industry of this locality</page><page sequence="16">206 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH is not fully or directly established. A mandible (T-1) is the type of the nomen mauritanicus Arambourg. In known elements there are both derived distinc- tions from, and some resemblance to, the Olduvai/LLK p-deme hypodigm- but comparisons are weakened by either insecure attributions (at Olduvai) and/ or poor cranial representation (at Tighenif). A single postcranial (femoral dia- physis) from Ain Maarouf (= El Hajeb) might be considered, parsimoniously, as representative of this p-deme. Probably attributable to a similar and thus presumably related p-deme are geologically younger gnathic-dental remains from Sidi Abderrahman (Littorina Cave-F; Thomas Quarry-1) and calvarial (fron- tal) and dental remains (Thomas Quarry-3). Acheulean industrial associations are known in some of these situations. The Sale partial cranium unfortunately affords a most incomplete and imperfect characterization of calvarial morphol- ogy due to its quite extensive occipital pathology; its demic affinities are, for now, obscure, and it is geologically younger. Kabwe The type of the nomen rhodesiensis Woodward is represented by a complete adult cranium (Kabwe-NNM, E-686). It is still the most complete individual cra- nium of this p-deme. Other individuals, from the Kabwe (formerly Broken Hill) mine, are represented by a partial maxilla (K-2, E-687) and a parietal (K-3, E-897); at this localitf in central Zambia, some 3 individuals, all of unresolved association and demonstrable provenance, are represented by several fragmented parts of the axial (sacrum, innominate) and upper (humerus) and lower (femora, tibia) appen- dicular skeleton. An additional calvarium from Elandsfontein (South Africa), found in a rich and diverse faunal association and a presumptive Acheulean industrial context, corroborates closely the morphology of the first found individual. An addi- tional representative is doubtless the Ndutu cranium (from the eponymous ephem- eral lakelet west of Olduvai Gorge) derived from a lateral equivalent of the upper Masek Beds (Norkilili Member) or perhaps even the superimposed Ndutu Beds. The latter (upper unit) have ages of 0.22 to 0.38 mya. The Bodo (middle Awash, Ethiopia) cranial specimen (with an Acheulean industrial association), which shares most derived features with Kabwe (but few with the Olduvai H.9 individual), is appropriately attributed to this p-deme. It has a projected age of -0.64-0.60 mya from nearby tephra of known age. Another partial parietal and distal humerus de- rive from the same level and locality. Hominin remains from Baringo basin (Kapthurin Formation, Kenya), including two mandibles with dentition (BK-67, 8518) and an ulna (BK-63), might similarly fall within this group or even prove ultimately to constitute a separate, distinctive p-deme once associated gnathic and cranial elements are known. There are a variety of industrial associations, of both advanced Acheulean and earlier Middle Stone Age (MSA), in these several situa- tions. Either uncertainties of stratigraphic resolution, correlation, or isotopic dat- ing and/or the fragmentary nature of hominin specimens of demonstrable mid/late Middle Pleistocene age often limit efforts at p-deme assignment in this area. Such is the case in several instances: the generally fragmentary cranial parts from the Eyasi Beds of the Eyasi basin (northern Tanzania), probably of upper Ndutu-equiva-</page><page sequence="17">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 207 lent age and having an early MSA archaeological context; fragmentary cranio-facial parts (Old. H.11) from the lower Ndutu Beds at Olduvai Gorge; and maxillary teeth and a fragmentary femur from Lainyamok (southern Kenya). In sub-Saharan Af- rica, one of the very few indisputable associations of hominin remains with ad- vanced or Upper Acheulean is that of a partial subadult right mandible with some dentition from the Cave of Hearths (Makapansgat Valley, Transvaal). As it lacks a number of derived features in respect to Homo sapiens, it is simply parsimonious to refer it to this same p-deme. However, in-depth comparative analysis vis-a-vis the Kapthurin Formation mandibles has never been made. Irhoud This p-deme is well typified by an adult cranium (no. 1) and subadult cal- varium (no. 2) and mandible (no. 3). An imperfect infant humerus (no. 4) is also known, all from the eponymous cave filling in southern coastal Morocco. ESR age estimates (90-125 kya, EU; 105-190 kya, LU) suggest an age within 180 stage 6. Partial cranial and gnathic-dental remains from Kebibat (Mifsud-Guidice Quarry, Morocco) may well represent the same or at least a closely related p- deme. The fronto-facial fragment from Zuttiyeh Cave (Galilee), which shares similar derivative features, should also be attributed to the same p-deme. It occurred in the basal infilling in an Acheuleo-Yabrudian (so-called Mugharan Tradition) industrial context. That situation and distinctive micro-faunal asso- ciations indicative of substantial antiquity have led to its long overdue reevalu- ation. (The Irhoud occurrence is perhaps less old, with the industrial associa- tion comparable to Levantine Mousterian, perhaps equivalent to the Tabun-D type.) The estimated age range at Zuttiyeh is &gt; 150-250 kya, based on several U-series determinations on stalactites or travertines. Although such age esti- mates are not yet well grounded, T/L ages on flint for the overlying Mous- terian deposits vary from 106 ? 7 to 157 + 13 kya. Further isotopic dating is sorely needed. Elsewhere, uncorrected T/L ages on this industry have been minimally 160 ? 22 kya (Hummal, Syria) and 195 ? 15 kya (Yabrud-lb, Syria). The Mugharan industry is now well documented only in the central and north- ern Levant and in southern Anatolia. Another such hominin fossil association, a femoral fragment of indeterminate demic affinity, is that of Tabun (level Eb) at Mt. Carmel, considered to be of 180 stage 6 or even older age. A few parts of the axial skeleton and a partial femur occur in the lower infilling (level III-3) of the Karain Cave (southern Anatolia) in a Charentian (= Mugharan-like) indus- trial context. Similarly, the demic affinities of the fragmentary hominin remains from the Sel'Ungur Cave infilling (Kirgizia, central Asia), found in an industrial association with some resemblances to the foregoing, are also unresolved. A final mid-Pleistocene age is commonly estimated. Florisbad Although less complete than some other specimens, this partial cranium from fossiliferous spring deposits in the former Orange Free State (South Af- rica) is demonstrably distinctive and in fact constitutes the type of the nomen</page><page sequence="18">208 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH helmei Dreyer. New nondestructive ESR dating methods indicate the consid- erable age of -259 + 35 kya. Other cranial specimens now known to be closely similar, and hence possibly attributable to this demic unit, include the Omo/ Kibish-2 calvarium, the Eliye Springs (ES-11693) partial cranium, and the Laetoli (Ngaloba Beds, Tanzania) H.18 cranium. The latter is the most fully intact of the lot, as the facial skeleton is largely preserved. Multiple isotopic methods afford an age of rather greater than -0.20 mya. A partial adult cranium (ER- 3884), preserving significant parts of the vault, and a large femur (ER-999), each with markedly derived morphology, from the Ileret area (Areas 5 and 1A) east Turkana basin similarly exemplify this group. U-series ages range be- tween -272-279 and -301 kya. All these specimens exhibit substantially de- rived aspects of cranial morphology vis-a-vis antecedent African p-demes and also diverge quite fundamentally from the pene-contemporaneous Neandertal p-deme of western Eurasia. Klasies River Mouth This p-deme is based on fragmentary but varied cranio-gnathic-dental elements and fragmented postcranial parts from several levels of the Sands-Ash-Shell Mem- ber (up to 10 m, with MSA II industry) of the Klasies River Mouth (KRM) Main Cave complex (South Africa). The complex is a single sedimentary depository sub- divided spatially into Caves 1, 1C, 2, 1A, and adjacent lB. Most remains derive from the lower levels of Cave 1, with fewer specimens from 1A and from 1B; some evidence suggests that most such specimens may well be of broadly comparable antiquity. The minimum number of individuals is at least 5. There is some evi- dence to suggest that fragmentary maxillary parts (2 individuals) from the lower and older Light Brown Sand Member of 1A represent an antecedent, but related, demic sample. These remains extend back, in part at least, to the equivalent of the Eemian interglacial (180 stage 5). It can be argued, both pro and con, that the hominin sample from Border Cave should best be attributed to the same or at least a closely related p-deme. I increasingly tend to support that view. Descriptive and in-depth comparative morphometric studies largely confirm this hypothesis and at the same time demonstrate the mosaic, but also strongly derived, character of the known cranial/gnathic morphology. The same might be said in respect to the largely den- tal samples from Die Kelders and Equus Caves and those vault and teeth parts associated with an MSA III industry at KRM-1A (South Africa) and from Mumba shelter (Eyasi basin, Tanzania). The latter, at least, closely approximate Homo sapiens size and morphology. Singa(?) Several hominin specimens of near-"modern" (sapiens) morphology and of earlier Upper Pleistocene age may well constitute a distinctive p-deme. The eponymous locality is Singa on the lower Blue Nile (Sudan), from which a some- what pathological partial calvarium (BM.M 15546) in association with extinct fauna and an MSA industry was recovered from caliche in Pleistocene clays/ silts. A minimum U-series age of 133 + 2 kya (LU) obtains for the enclosing</page><page sequence="19">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 209 matrix. A combined U/Th and ESR (LU) age estimate ranges between 94 ? 17 and 127 ? 19 kya. The hominin specimen of Taramsa Hill (southern Egypt), an imperfect juvenile skull and postcranial skeleton interred within (and beneath) a Middle Paleolithic context in a chert extraction quarry, may be of equivalent morphology. OSL age assessment on the aeolian sand infilling affords ages of 49.8-80.4 (x = 55.5 ? 3.7) kya. Dar es Soltane The p-demic attribution derives from the Dar es Soltane Cave complex (Mo- rocco), in which an adult anterior cranium and associated mandible (no. 5), an adolescent mandible, and a partial juvenile cranium were recovered in Cave-II below an Aterian industry. Overall, this sample, distinguished by gnathic and dental robusticity, bridges the structure of the Skhul/Qafzeh p-deme and that of late Pleistocene Homo sapiens. There are still few, though significant, hominin representatives associated with the Aterian Industrial Complex. This industry clearly has its roots in the North African Mousterian, although it is distinguished by basal tangs on many artifacts. The industry has an extensive pan-Saharan distribution, including the Maghreb, and is persistent through a substantial, if still ill-determined, time span, even back to the earliest Upper Pleistocene. The first known, fragmentary remains (Peabody Museum, Harvard Univer- sity, N/3635) were those of an adult (3 isolated teeth) and a juvenile (partial maxilla with unerupted C and Ps) from Mugharet el Aliya (Tangier). These remains do not reveal Neandertal features as once suggested. Other remains include a largely complete adult mandible body with dentition and cranial vault fragments from Contrabandiers Cave (Temara, Morocco) in an upper Aterian context. Radiocarbon determinations suggest an age &gt;35 kya. These several specimens confirm a mosaic morphology, including plesiomorphic gnathic struc- ture and more derived features. Another mandible with dentition is also known in Aterian context at Zouhra Cave (El Haroura, Morocco). An Aterian level (no. 1) there has a T/L age of 41,160 ? 3,500 kya. Continental Eastern Asia Yunxian This find stands for the moment as among the oldest documented hominins in eastern Asia. It is represented by two relatively complete, but substantially distorted, crania from Quyuanhekou, in the richly fossiliferous and artifact- bearing middle terrace deposits of the Han River (Hubei). The occurrence spans the upper Matuyama chron and postdates the Jaramillo subchron, affording a projected age of 0.83-0.87 mya. This is congruent with the composition of the associated faunal assemblage. ESR measures provide a minimum age of 0.581 ? 0.93 mya, an underestimate due to complete saturation and high U-content of the measured samples. So far as it is known, this p-deme shares some of the features characteristic of the Zhoukoudian p-deme, whereas others are attenu- ated if expressed at all. The Gongwangling (Lantian, Shaanxi) partial calvar- ium, including maxillary fragments, is of broadly comparable age. The calvarium</page><page sequence="20">210 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH is deformed, with substantially altered surface relief; however, it shares fea- tures with i -th this deme and that of Zhoukoudian and in the former instance apparently thus invokes a more plesiomorphous state. Zhoukoudian (ZKD) This find was the first major documentation of an extinct form of humanity in continental eastern Asia. The essential sample to which the nomen pekinensis Black and Zdansky is applied is the substantial hominin collection of Zhoukoudian-1 locality (Hebei). The hominin remains, in association with very diverse mammalian (97 species) and avian (62 species) faunas, were repre- sented in nine beds in the cave. The associated lithic industry is extremely abundant, relatively unrefined technologically, made on a range of raw material sources (although one class predominates), and is quite diverse in retouched tool categories. The deposit accumulated over some 350 kya between -580 and 230 kya according to a diversity of isotopic dating methods. Evidence of fire is documented in some four successive horizons of the infilling. The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary is recorded at the base of level 13. The hominin sample comprises some 45 individuals, 20 percent of which are immature, largely represented by calvarial, gnathic, and dental elements, and only few (14) and incomplete postcranial parts. The particular morphological character and dis- tinctiveness of this deme is well documented; consequently it is a central com- parative focus for all subsequent additions to the Asian hominin record. Other samples of the deme exist in other areas of largely northern/central China: in Shaanxi (Chenjiawo, a mandible, holotype of the nomen lantianensis Woo, in a loess-paleosoil succession pertaining to the lower Brunhes chron); in caves in Shandong (Qizian Hill or Yiyuan) and Henan (Xinghuashan); and in Hubei (Longushan, Builongdong, Longgudong), Anhui (Longtandong or Hexian), Kangsu (Huludong), and Guizhou (Yanhuidong). Many of these samples compromise iso- lated or associated teeth; Yiyuan and Huludong comprise cranial parts. The Longtandong (Hexian) level 2 remains (a skull plus postcranial elements from some 4 individuals), considered by some as morphologically "advanced" compared to the bulk of the ZKD-1 hominin remains, have a conjoint ESR/U-series age of -412 ? 25 kya; thus they have an antiquity comparable to the older representatives of the ZKD-1 sample (beds 8-9). On the other hand, the Halu Cave (Tangshan, Nanjing) yields a partial, adult, probably male, calvarium (no. 2) and another more complete adult cranium (no. 1) preserving half the facial skeleton in a ZKD-like faunal con- text (levels 6-7). These have an isotopic age of some 350 kya (-332-395). (It should be noted, however, that recent U-series ages of levels at ZKD-1 and Halu Cave are some 200 kya older than these values.) This p-deme has been demon- strated through morphometric analysis to be well differentiated from older and/or pene-contemporaneous hominin p-deme(s) of the Sunda Shelf. Dali This p-deme is represented, perhaps solely, by a well-preserved cranium with displaced lower facial skeleton from ancient terrace gravels of the locality</page><page sequence="21">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 211 Tianshuigou (Shaanxi), the name deriving from the eponymous county. This is the type of the nomen daliensis X. Wu, proposed to accommodate this and some other purportedly related specimens. This individual shares some (not all) plesiomorphies and autapomorphies of both the Yunxian and ZKD p-demes and, contrariwise, exhibits certain derived features of proportions and confor- mations of cranial vault elements and some derived reorganization of mid-fa- cial structure. Overall there are significant distinctions from antecedent Asian p-demes. Other localities which might conceivably afford representatives of this deme could include Walongdong and Guojiujan (Changyang County, Hubei), Chaoxian (or Yanshan; Anhui), and perhaps also Yonhuidong Cave (Tongzi Prov- ince, Guizhou) and the loess/paleosoil occurrence of Dingcun (Shaanxi). How- ever, requisite comparative studies are still required to substantiate any such inference. All these occurrences for which U-series age determinations are available purportedly range in age from &lt;250 to &gt; 115 kya and approximately 200 ? 40 kya and hence are of upper Middle Pleistocene age. Jinniushan This p-deme, distinct from that of Dali, is represented by a restored and largely complete cranium (and dentition) and some associated axial (vertebrae, innominate) and appendicular (including manus and pes) elements of an adult male individual from level 7 of the eponymous cave locality (Liaoning). Several sets of U-series measurements afford various ages for different parts of the infilling, with values as great as -280 kya for level 7. Other, subsequent U- series and ESR ages of -200 kya have been obtained for this level. Although as yet only preliminarily described, this individual seemingly departs in some significant aspects of cranial vault and facial morphology from Dali and in that respect exhibits a more derived morphotype. It is rather unclear the extent to which this structure is paralleled or reflected in the Xujiayao skeletal series of some two dozen cranial vault bones, jaw fragments, and teeth (sampling per- haps as many as 10 individuals) from a fluvio-lacustrine sequence of the Liyigou River, Datong basin (Shaanxi). The U-series ages here are substantially younger, between --125 and 104 kya. The remains exhibit some derived features of vault elements in respect to conformation and superstructure development, cranial base (temporal bone), middle meningeal vascularization, and, to an ex- tent, facial mass and prognathism. Maba/Hathnora This p-deme was first documented in 1958 by the recovery of a large hominin partial calvarium from a fissure fill in Shizi Hill (near Maba, Guangdong). It is the type of the nomen mapaensis Kurth. Its divergence from the ZKD morphotype and otherwise purportedly archaic features, coupled with incom- pleteness, long obfuscated elucidation of its affinities. Its comparison with the Neandertal p-deme has been at best ill formulated and is empirically unsus- tainable. The recovery of another partial calvarium near Hathnora, in the middle reaches of the Narmada Valley (Madhya Pradesh, India), from a terrace fill</page><page sequence="22">212 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH conglomerate and in a Late Acheulean industrial context, affirms the morpho- logical features of Maba. (It constitutes the type of the nomen narmadensis Sonakia.) Although unfortunately incomplete in critical areas of the vault and lacking the facial skeleton, both individuals are fundamentally similar in total morphological pattern and exhibit a melange of primitive, derived, and unique features. These diverge from those of the ZKD, Dali, or Jinniushan p-demes and strongly suggest separate demic attribution. If, as the author believes, this attribution is maintained, it has important biogeographic implications in re- spect to differential demic distributions within eastern Asia. The Sunda Shelf (Southeast Asia) Glagahomba/Sangiran This designation is proposed for a poorly known and ill-appreciated hominin considered here to be a distinctive p-deme. The name Glagahomba refers to a locality on the northern limb of the Sangiran dome (anticline) near which one such hominin specimen (Sangiran-8 or B, an imperfect mandible with denti- tion) is specifically provenienced. The initial ("type") specimen (Sangiran-6 or A, right and left mandible fragments with some dentition) derived, ambigu- ously, from the same general area, but to the north toward Brangkal; it consti- tutes the lectotype of the nomen palaeojavanicus von Koenigswald. Another such fragment (S-5), reportedly collected east of Kalijoso and the holotype of the nomen dubius von Koenigswald, might also be attributed to this group, as have been one (S-31) and/or another (S-27, cranial base and upper dentition) calvarial/cranial remains. The latter specimens derive from the central dome area (around Punden Jokotingir). These specimens derive apparently near (and below) a lower lahar deposit with single crystal laser fusion (SCLF) ages of -1.66 to 1.77 mya, that is, at the end of or just subsequent to the Olduvai subchron. These several examples have such a distinctive set of gnathic, den- tal, and vault morphologies and sizes, strongly autapomorphic, as to set them apart from other peninsular p-deme(s), particularly that of Trinil/Sangiran. Brangkal/Sangiran This designation is proposed for a distinct p-deme recovered in the northern area of the Sangiran dome, as represented by the partial cranial remains with maxillary dentition of Sangiran-4. This is the holotype of the nomen robustus Weidenreich. Its salient characters and known total morphological pattern were adumbrated fifty years ago. It is unclear whether isolated mandible portions with dentition (S-lb) and maxilla fragment S-la from south Bukuran (eastern dome) and S-9 from near Tegopati/Wonolelo (northeastern dome) should be similarly attributed. This is also unfortunately the case in respect to the Perning- 1 (eastern Java) infantile calvarium, the type of the nomen modjokertensis von Koenigswald. This is among the oldest documented hominin(s) on the Sunda Shelf, on the order of -1.8 mya from SCLF age assessment. Both these more ancient p-demes derive from the mid-Matuyama chron. Although other claims have been put forth, each does differ in known overall morphological structure</page><page sequence="23">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 213 of gnathic and/or cranial parts from the younger and well-represented Trinil/ Sangiran p-deme. Trinil/Sangiran This p-deme is among the best represented of Pleistocene Sundaland hominins. The holotype, a calotte (Trinil-2) excavated from Trinil (Solo River, east-central Java), is the source of the nomen erectus Dubois. Excavated postcrania (femora) have been both deleted from (T-3) and associated with (T- 6-9) this sample (which also includes a PI). However, the first specimen found was an indeterminate mandible fragment from Kedung-Brubus, from which a femoral diaphysis was also subsequently recognized. Anticlinally deformed la- hars, volcaniclastics, and fluviatile sediments (Bapang Formation) of the Sangiran dome afford the largest single demic sample from this region--cra- nial elements (16, including 4 crania, partial crania, 2 natural endocasts, and 9 gnathic elements with dentition), isolated teeth, and uncommon postcrania (1+), in an incomplete listing. The sample is distinguished by its extensive hyperos- tosis and suite of autapomorphic character states. It should be noted that one cranium, S-17, preserving both vault and facial skeleton and partial dentition- often figured and cited due to its relative completeness-has been sometimes asserted to share features with purportedly ancient crania from Sahulland. This position is contraindicated by a well-crafted reconstruction of S-17 and atten- dant analytical reassessment of its morphology. On the basis of morphometric analyses, this p-deme has been demonstrated to be consistently distinctive from a counterpart (ZKD) in eastern Asia. This is scarcely surprising in view of the repeated disjunctive relationships of Sundaland with peninsular Southeast Asia. The age span at Sangiran (Bapang Formation) has been variously inter- preted through paleomagnetics and fission track measurements. More recent Ar/Ar, SCLF assessment of successive tuff horizons suggest an age span of -1.58-0.98 mya (C.C. Swisher, personal communication) and thus an antiq- uity greater than previously envisioned. Ngandong This p-deme is represented by the substantial excavated hominin sample from the eponymous locality of the central Solo River. It comprises numerous cranial adult and subadult vault elements and partial or more complete calvaria and sev- eral postcrania (tibial diaphyses, innominate fragment). This constitutes the type of the nomen soloensis Oppenoorth (of which a calotte, N-1, is the holotype). Two other localities of this drainage, Sambungmachan (a meander between Trinil and Sangiran) and Ngawi (east of Trinil), have each yielded calvaria (and the former also a tibial diaphysis) attributable to this same p-deme. It shares the same fun- damental morphotype of the Trinil/Sangiran p-deme in association with some further autapomorphic states of calvarial size, proportions, and shape. The sample and immediately associated fauna apparently date from well into the Upper Pleis- tocene. Broadly comparable ESR and U-series ages of 27 + 3 (EU) to 46 + 4 (LU) kya for Ngandong and 27 ? 3 (EU) to 53 ? 4 (LU) kya for Sambungmachan</page><page sequence="24">214 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH are now known. However, older ages of &gt; 150 kya (by gamma spectrometry) for crania (nos. 1) of each locality are also known (C. Falgueres, personal communi- cation). In any case, there is substantial evidence to document the persistence in an insular situation of a distinctive archaic hominin. Claims put forth for overall morphological conformity between this p-deme and some purportedly ancient hominin remains from Sahulland, in particular the Willandra Lakes partial calva- rium, WLH-50 (NSW, Australia), are borne out neither by morphometric analy- sis nor by particular morphological structure of cranial base elements. Western Eurasia Dmanisi For the moment this constitutes the oldest known p-deme in western Eurasia. The single specimen, an adult mandible with full dentition, derives from fluvio- lacustrine sediments of the eponymous locality in the Georgian Caucasus and apparently dates from the post-Olduvai subchron interval of the Matuyama chron. It is associated with an upper Villafranchian type fauna (Palaearctic as- pect) having minimal African components and a lithic industry within the Mode 1 technological stage (of Oldowan Industrial Complex affinity). A comparable occurrence of broadly similar (or maybe just younger) age is that of 'Ubeidiya (Jordan Rift), at which are extensively documented over 60 artifact-bearing horizons attributable to both the Oldowan and Acheulean industries and rich faunal associations of mixed Palaearctic/Ethiopian aspect. The Dmanisi hominin has a mosaic of characters, in part shared with the African Nariokotome p- deme (1.70-1.5 mya), in part with more derived hominins, and others of which are seemingly autapomorphically unique. These occurrences are critical in the recognition and elucidation of the timing and processes attendant upon African hominin dispersal into Eurasia. Atapuerca-Gran Dolina From very recent excavations of the Gran Dolina karstic cavity at Atapuerca (Spain), hominin occupation is documented in at least two lower levels, TD-4 (rare) and overlying TD-6 (abundantly). These lower reaches of a 20 m infilling fall within the upper Matuyama chron and antedate the B/M geomagnetic in- version recorded higher in the sequence. An inferred age of 800-900 kya is a reasonable approximation. The TD-6 level includes a substantial lithic assem- blage (lacking Acheulean diagnostics), abundant faunal residues, and hominin cranial, gnathic, dental, and postcranial elements (of some 6 individuals). This sample constitutes the type of the nomen antecessor Bermtidez de Castro et al. The overall morphological pattern as thus far revealed is distinctive and is definitely less derived and hence unlike that of less ancient European counter- parts, all of which appear to show some autapomorphic features. Resemblances to older African hominin structure, including the Nariokotome p-deme, occur in the premolar/molar dentition. However, cranial capacity is seemingly el- evated (?1,000 cc), the development (calcification) of anterior relative to molar teeth indicates prolonged maturation, and the mid-facial morphology is derived.</page><page sequence="25">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 215 Some features of the mandible, frontal, and temporal bones are reminiscent of subsequent European hominins of Middle Pleistocene age. Manual and pedal elements reveal both strongly derived ("modern"-like) and autapomorphic fea- tures. Comparison with the antecedent Dmanisi p-deme is restricted due to the scant comparability of skeletal parts. However, the Gran Dolina sample clearly merits recognition as a new p-deme. A partial adult calvarium recently recovered serendipitously from paludal sediments in the Ceprano basin (south- ern Latium, Italy) antedates a mid-Pleistocene volcanic succession and is un- derlain by fluvial sands yielding a Galerian mammalian fauna and a non- Acheulean industry (Castro dei Volsci facies). Further geological and associated studies suggest an age within the upper Matuyama chron probably broadly comparable to Gran Dolina. The calvarium exhibits morphological develop- ment analogous to that of the Atapuerca-Gran Dolina p-deme and may be pro- visionally parsimoniously subsumed within it. Mauer/Arago Hominin remains from these localities once constituted the oldest docu- mented hominin samples in Europe proper. The isolated Mauer mandible with dentition from the Grafenrain Quarry (German Rhineland) is the type of the nomen heidelbergensis Schoetensack. The Arago sample (eastern French Pyrenees), probably over a dozen individuals (comprising cranio-facial elements, 2 partial mandibles, dentitions, and various postcranial elements), is best taken as a paratype and basis of comparison. Each occurrence has rich faunal associa- tions and, in the case of Arago, a biface-poor, flake-dominated lithic industry of distinctive Taubachian-like facies. Overall, this p-deme is distinguished by an idiosyncratic regional mosaic of some (sym)plesiomorphic cranial, gnathic, and postcranial features coupled with derived apomorphic features of other aspects of the cranium (fronto-parietal elements, facial skeleton) and mandible (symphy- sis and ramus, dentition) which may approximate and foreshadow the structure characteristic of subsequent Neandertals. There is no direct evidence as yet to attribute the Boxgrove (Sussex, England) tibial diaphysis to this p-deme, although that attribution is perhaps not inappropriate. Boxgrove has both faunal and exten- sive Acheulean industrial associations. The extent to which fragmentary homi- nin remains from Italy-including Fontana-Ranuccio (Latium; dentition), Visogliano-2 (Trieste; mandible fragment, upper premolar), and Venosa- Notarchirico (Basilicata; femoral diaphysis)-might reflect this or another re- lated p-deme remains to be evaluated. The Mauer/Arago p-deme encompasses an ill-defined mid-Pleistocene time span broadly within the mid-Brunhes chron, perhaps 0.45-0.60 mya (about 80 stages 16-12). There is a notable temporal gap between it and antecedent Atapuerca-Gran Dolina p-demes. Petralona/Atapuerca-Sima This p-deme is among the best known and characterized in the European mid-Pleistocene due to the early recognition of the distinctive Petralona (Khalkidhiki, Greece) cranium, the type of the nomen petralonensis Murrill.</page><page sequence="26">216 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH More recently, the extensive hominin assemblage of all major skeletal ele- ments from dozens of subadult and adult individuals recovered from the Sima de los Huesos Cave at Atapuerca has afforded the largest single hominin sample from the mid-Pleistocene of Europe; and it is enlarged yearly as fieldwork progresses. This remarkable sample also affords a basis for fuller evaluation and attribution of isolated and less complete/damaged specimens-Montmaurin (France) mandible; Vertesszil6s (Hungary) occipital and dental elements; and Swanscombe (England), Steinheim, and Bilzingsleben (Germany) partial cra- nia)-about which considerable discussion and indeed some controversy has prevailed over too many years. The Steinheim specimen is the type of the nomen steinheimensis Berckhemer; this nomen has priority over petralonensis. These examples, along with the still ill-known Apidima Diros (southern Greece) crania and perhaps the recently found and remarkably complete Altamura (Italy) skeleton, may ultimately prove to be attributable to the same demic group. Similarly, a diversity of more or less fragmentary hominin specimens from Italy-Prince Cave in Liguria (innominate) and in the Latium, Castel di Guido (cranial, femoral fragments), Cava Pompi (postcrania, cranial fragments), Casal de Pazzi (cranial fragment), Sedia del Diavolo (postcranial/cranial fragments), and Ponte Mammolo (postcranial fragment)-all require comparative examina- tion from this perspective. This p-deme reveals persistence of some plesio- morphic features but exhibits a substantially still stronger and widespread ex- pression of Neandertal autapomorphies (synapomorphies) throughout the cranial, gnathic, and postcranial skeletons. The time span of this p-deme is broadly estimated as about 400-300 kya (180 stages 11-9). All referred repre- sentatives have faunal associations, and known industrial associations vary from biface-rich Middle Acheulean (as at Swanscombe, Castel di Guido) to several manifestations of flake-based Taubachian-like industries (Vertessz6l6s, Bilzingsleben) in largely open-air situations. An occurrence at Schoiningen (lower Saxony), still lacking hominin remains, but rich in vertebrate fauna and in lithic and organic artifacts, including some half-dozen well-preserved spears, affords a window into subsistence and social behavior hitherto often lacking at many other known European hominin archaeological localities of broadly com- parable age. P-Deme Indeterminate: Western Asia The apparently oldest mid-Pleistocene hominin occurrence in the Levant is that of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (GBY) in the Jordan River Valley, associated with an African-style Middle Acheulean assemblage. The B/M boundary oc- curs about halfway through the 34-m-thick fluvio-lacustrine sequence; most human occupation likely falls within the lower Brunhes chron and is at least &lt;800 kya (based also on the age of the underlying Yarda Basalt). The p-deme represented (hominin femoral diaphyses) is indeterminate on available evi- dence. A recent and important addition is a largely complete left parietal from the karstic locality of Nadaouiyeh Ain Askar (El Kowm basin, southern Syria) in a mid/upper Acheulean industrial context. (It is the next lowest of five dis-</page><page sequence="27">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 217 tinguishable "phases" within a protracted succession of Acheulean, Yabrudian, Hummalian, and terminal Acheulean assemblages.) The specimen exhibits dis- tinctive and seemingly plesiomorphic and autapomorphic features. P-deme affili- ation is still to be ascertained. This is equally the case for the gnathic fragment from Azykh Cave (southern Azerbaidzhan, Transcaucasus) in an Acheulean association context and perhaps of broadly similar, if not rather younger, age. Kudaro-I Cave (Osetia, southern Caucasus) is another (reportedly Middle) Acheulean occupation with a single, indeterminate hominin specimen. In view of the demonstrable African character of the GBY industrial occurrence, it would be premature to consider its attendant hominin to be of strictly European as opposed to African demic affinity. Skhul/Qafzeh This p-deme (S/Q) is well and only surely known from the eponymous cave localities of Mugharet es-Skhul (level B, Mt. Carmel) and Djebel Qafzeh (lev- els 17-23, Galilee) in the southern Levant. These samples comprise the partial or semicomplete adult and infantile skeletons, with associated skull parts, of 10 and 13 individuals, respectively. (An infant individual [no. 1] from the es- Skhul site is designated the lectotype for the species/subspecies nomen palestinus McCown and Keith.) In cranial vault and facial morphology, gnathic features, and some dental characteristics, both ontogenetically and in adults, and in varied aspects of postcranial axial and appendicular morphology and pro- portions, these samples differ consistently and substantively from Neandertals. Thus, they more closely approximate the H. sapiens condition, without how- ever replicating it. A very likely, if not firmly established, attribution to the S/Q deme is the Tabun-C2 adult mandible. At the great cave of Haua Fteah in Cyrenaican Libya, two partial human mandibles from an industrial association in beds XXXII-XXXIII comparable to that of S/Q in the Levant very likely repre- sent the same p-deme. Some phenetic and thus presumably genetic affiliations of S/Q with the Maghrebian p-deme of Irhoud, of which a representative (Zuttiyeh) is known in the southern Levant, have been established. This p-deme is associated with the Levantine Levalloiso-Mousterian (LM) at these three localities and in particular with the LM-C industrial manifesta- tion (epitomized by the Tabun Cave sequence of D, C, and B subdivisions ac- cording to upwards successive beds). All these occurrences have afforded age estimations (Table 6) by three isotopic methods-U-series, ESR, and T/L. In all instances, the ages are substantial and fall broadly within the mid to lower reaches of 180 stage 5, and perhaps in the (decreasing) age order of Tabun-C, Qafzeh/17-23, and Skhul-B. (There has long been uncertainty of the sedimen- tary unit attribution of the Tabun-C1 skeleton-a female Neandertal-found at the top margin of the deposit; new isotopic age assessment indicates its sur- prisingly much younger age, -35 kya, suggesting that it had been intrusive from level B.) ESR ages for Tabun-B (fauna) are 86 ? 11 kya (EU) and 103 ? 18 kya (LU). T/L ages for the Tabun succession are uniformly greater than ages afforded by other methods; this is so throughout that succession.</page><page sequence="28">218 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH TABLE 6 Isotopic Age Determinations on Skhul/Qafzeh and Neandertal P-Deme Localities, Western Asia ESR (kya) Locality/Bed(s) U-Series (kya) EU LU T/L (kya) Qafzeh Level 19 89.0 + 3 96.0 + 13 115.0 ? 15 Av. 92 ? 5 (isochron 88 ? 9) Levels 17-23 106.0 + 2 100.0 ? 10 120.0 ? 8 Skhul-B 80.3 + 6 81.0 ? 15 101.0 ? 12.6 Av. 119 ? 18 (99-167) Tabun-B 86 ? 11 103 ? 18 Tabun-C1 skeleton 34 ? 5 (33 ? 4) Tabun-C 101.5 ? 2.9 102.0 _ 17 119.0 ? 11 171 ? 17 (134-184) Amud B-1 (Hom. 1 level) 43 + 5 48 6 -50-60 B-2/8 (Hom. 7 level) (N = 3) 59 ? 8 70 ? 8 Kebara X 60 ? 6 64 + 4 61.6 + 3.6 XII (Hom. 2 level) 59.9 ? 3.5 Neandertal This p-deme was the first premodern human form known in the fossil record and is now the most fully and geographically extensively represented earlier hominin from western Eurasia. The first recognized example, a partial skel- eton from Feldhofer Cave, Neandertal, is the type of the nomen neanderthalensis King. This p-deme is most extensively documented in the European Last Gla- cial (180 stages 4-3), from central (Teshik-Tash) and western (Shanidar) Asia into the Levant (Kebara, Amud, Tabun-C1, Dederiyeh), in the Crimea, and throughout the reaches of central and western Europe into the Apennine and Iberian peninsulas. Its earlier history is documented in "O stage 5 (in Croatia at Krapina, in Italy at Saccopastore, in France at La Chaise-Bourgeois-Delaunay, in Slovakia at Gainovce, and in Germany at Taubach and Salzgitter-Lebenstedt), stage 6 (in France at Lazaret, La Chaise-Suard, Fontichevade, and Biache and in Wales at Pontnewydd), and even into stage 7 (Ehringsdorf in Germany). Partial or largely complete skeletons, some in definite interment circumstances, enable a very full elucidation of skeletal paleobiology. The distinctiveness of the p-deme, with extensive autapomorphic character states throughout its spatio-temporal range and including variability, aspects of dimorphism, and ontogenetic devel- opment, is well established and extensively documented. There are overall</page><page sequence="29">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 219 phenetic resemblances and sharing of particular discrete traits with anteced- ent demes, particularly with the Petralona/Atapuerca p-deme and, but substan- tially less so, with that of Mauer/Arago. The Mousterian technocomplex is well known to manifest very substantial vari- ability in respect to both technological processes and typological composition of lithic assemblages. Efforts at delineating and partitioning this variability led to con- cepts of Mousterian "facies," or variants, variously recognized on technological/ functional (economic) and/or presumed stylistic grounds. The extent to which ana- lytical procedures and typological systematics have been appropriate to any such delineation, and hence the extent to which any such categories reflect natural (that is, cognitively/behaviorally real) categories, has come under intense scrutiny and, not surprisingly, severe criticism. In particular, the use of such presumptive cat- egories to identify conscious social units (e.g., ethnic groups) has been repeatedly questioned. Sampling factors alone can and do affect assemblage representative- ness, as also do such primary factors as diverse aspects of raw material resources, their availability, abundance, size, form, and quality; operational modes and se- quences employed in blank production and intensity and extent of reduction/utili- zation treatment of particular lithic categories; the functional linkage of particular artifact classes/types with specific patterns of human activity; the nature, size, du- ration, and overall intensity of occupational context; and the nature, extent, and setting of the occupational locality itself. Hence, it is possible to an extent to dis- sect assemblage composition, variability, and pattern in respect to such processual factors and, in conjunction with other analytical procedures appropriate to study of the composition of associated organic and inorganic residues and attendant natural factors, to elucidate such occurrences in far fuller, more holistic fashion. A seemingly ever-increasing number of distinguishable spatio-temporal vari- ants are now commonly recognized to be represented within the Middle Pale- olithic (Mousterian) technocomplex. These comprise (* = presence of hominin remains): Charentian Mousterian (CM)* complex, with Ferrassie (CM-F) and Quina (CM-Q)* groups-pan-Europe Typical Mousterian (TM)* complex, including (European) Levalloiso- Mousterian-pan-Europe; strongly laminar components at some, mostly open-air sites, in northwest, central, and eastern Europe and the Crimea Levantine Mousterian (LM)*-west Asian Levant Typical Mousterian/Crvena Stijena type (TM/CS)-Balkans Mousterian/Vasconian type (M-Va)-northern Spain Denticulate Mousterian (DM)*-pan-Europe Mousterian of Acheulean tradition (MTA)-western Europe Mousterian/Chatelperronian type (M-Ch)*"-southwestern Europe Mousterian/Cambresian type (M-Ca)-northwestern Europe Mousterian/Pontinian type (M-P)*"-greater Latium</page><page sequence="30">220 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Mousterian/Kartstein type (M-Ka)*-central Europe Mousterian/Tata type (M-Ta)-Biikk Mountains, Hungary Mousterian/Staroselje type (M-St)--Crimea Mousterian/Tsutskhvatskaya type (M-Tv)-Crimea, western Caucasus Mousterian/Khostinskaya type (M-Kh)-western Caucasus Mousterian/Kudaro type (M-Ku)-western Caucasus, Georgia Mousterian/Zagros type (M-Z)*-greater Zagros Mountains, Iran/Iraq European Micoquian (MQ), including subgroups: Bocksteinian (MQ-B)*-- central Europe; Altmiihlian (MQ-A)-upper Danube; Jankovician (MQ- J)*-trans/lower Danube; Babonyian (MQ-Ba)-Biikk Mountains, Hun- gary; and Kiik-Koban (MQ-KK)* and Ak-Kayan (MQ-AK)*-Crimea Acheuleo-Yabrudian (A-Y)*, or Levantine Mugharan Tradition (MT)- Levant These industrial groups and variants are distinguished on diverse and now much refined technological grounds (raw material exploitation, utilization, re- duction, and procedures of blank production) and typological composition (na- ture, diversity, relative frequencies of retouched pieces, and shaped "tools"). They may vary in duration; in local, provincial, or broader regional distribution; and seemingly sometimes in stratigraphic superposition or, more broadly, tem- poral occurrence. Although a matter of some controversy, they do not appar- ently readily or even directly reflect specific subsistence patterns and attendant activities. Contrariwise, the extent to which they reflect or somehow mirror resource exploitation, land-use practices, and extent and patterns of mobility has been a subject of enhanced interest and recent investigation. This promising development may thus afford linkages between otherwise disparate matters of technology, settlement, subsistence, resource use, provisioning practices, mo- bility, and group, local, and regional demographics. Such matters are of direct concern in the understanding of past populations, their adaptations, and dynam- ics. And they are central and critical for unraveling the disappearance of Mous- terian cultural practices in conjunction with Neandertal extinction. The midportion of 180 stage 3, between -45 and 32 kya, appears now to be a critical interval in the recent hominin evolutionary history in western Eurasia. The lower and upper limits of the interval are approximately bounded, respec- tively, by the H5 and H4 (Heinrich) events, episodes of massive enhanced iceberg discharges, attendant surface water cooling and strong oceanic influxes of fresh meltwater, and attendant perturbation of the North Atlantic conveyor circulation. These H-events constitute the repetitive crescendos of anteced- ent Dansgaard/Orschger (D-O) oscillations, pulses of global cooling reflected in high 180 depletions in North Atlantic marine cores and in Greenland ice core records. In the latter instance, a series of milder interstadials, i.12 through i.5, of decreasing age and varying in duration, occur over this interval between the variably spikey or rectangular-shaped D-O oscillations. In this respect, i.12</page><page sequence="31">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 221 and i.8 are particularly noteworthy in their greater duration and lesser 180 deple- tions (shorter, however, but otherwise comparable to the antecedent i.14-13 complex, between -52 and 46 kya). The -45-32 kya interval contrasts rather substantially with the subsequent Pleniglacial conditions of the Late Glacial and those antecedent pre-50 kya conditions of the early Pleniglacial. Terrestrial records only imperfectly mirror these ameliorations, largely due to preservational circumstances (e.g., erosional truncation, non-sequences, and relative rapidity of sedimentation). However, the Moershoofd (Netherlands) interstadial corresponds in part to the earlier reaches of the interval, and the Hengelo (Netherlands) to its later part. Pollen sequences, particularly from cores, at a number of localities in western and southern Europe now document the nature and extent of floral change, including other comparable milder ame- liorations, within this interval of the Late Pleistocene. Such evidence indicates substantial reduction of mean annual temperatures and of precipitation, steep north-south vegetational gradients, extensive and poorly and sparsely wooded areas, limited distribution of deciduous taxa, and distinctive mixed evergreen and deciduous circumstances (often open parkland) in steppic landscapes in diverse north Mediterranean situations. In its varied techno-typological manifestations, the Mousterian technocom- plex is well documented within the earlier half of this interval throughout west- ern Eurasia. This is established on both stratigraphic and on associated palyno- logical grounds in a large number of instances. Increasingly, geochronometric methods (some conventional 14C and, more recently, AMS, T/L, and to an ex- tent U-series and ESR) afford isotopic age assessments. (However, their reli- ability must be appreciated within the perspective of probabilities, error limits, and, particularly, requisite correction factors consequent upon demonstrable changes in geomagnetic field intensity.) Thus, within the subsequent 40-35 kya span, isotopic dating already provides ages of a number of Mousterian oc- currences in Iberia, France, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Greece, the Crimea, the Caucasus, and the Siberian Altai, unknown until only recently. And, equally interestingly, the persistence of Mousterian (and Neandertals) into the 35-30 kya range is similarly assessed in the case of cave/shelter occupations in Iberia (Beneito, Zafarraya, probably Carigudla, and others), in the Crimea (Zaskalnaya- 6, Kabazi-2), and in the Caucasus (L ska, Akhshtyr, Mezaiskaya in an MQ con- text). Although perhaps a premature and only partially substantiated conclu- sion, there is some suggestion of fragmentation with attendant peripheralization and isolation of once prevailing ranges and associated habitat utilization by Neandertal populations. Within this overall time span are also manifest new, distinctive, and provin- cially characteristic industries or industrial variants not manifest as such previ- ously. Some have been termed "transitional" industries, a premature perceptual commitment that tends to preempt understanding and explanation. Overall, two such manifestations appear rather alike, in part overlapping in time; some have considered them to be manifestations of a similar (if not the same) industrial complex. These are the Szeletian (of Moravia, southern Poland, and the Btikk</page><page sequence="32">222 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Mountains of Hungary) and the Jerzmanovician (of eastern Germany, southern Poland). In addition to a fundamentally Middle Paleolithic configuration, both have a few demonstrable Upper Paleolithic-like components. The Bohunician, restricted to Moravia and largely known from demonstrably workshop occur- rences, occurs also over a span of some 15 kya, until -35 kya. It is essentially a Mousterian/Levallois technique industry, but with Upper Paleolithic crested, prismatic-like core forms, some bifacial foliates, and a few Upper Paleolithic tool types, particularly in the steep scraper and burin categories (plus some dorsally retouched elements). Both local and some more distant raw material sources were exploited. Some (but not all) workers propose that these particular indus- trial manifestations correspond more probably to an "acculturation" phenom- enon between an autochthonous Mousterian technocomplex and that of an intru- sive early Upper Paleolithic (Aurignacian) technocomplex. The geographic distribution of the Mousterian Industrial Complex is exten- sive in western Asia, including Anatolia, the adjoining Caucasus, and the Crimea and environs, and in portions of southern central Asia, whereas the hominin fossil record is largely concentrated in the southern Levant and to an extent in the Transcaucasus and the Crimea. Three major temporal variants of the Levantine Levalloiso-Mousterian (LM) are epitomized by the Tabun succession. These variants (D, C, and B) exhibit quantitative differences in some technological practices, particularly core prepa- ration and blank production, and in the types and forms of finished tool prod- ucts and their frequencies. There are suggestions of certain differences in land- scape usage and attendant settlement pattern between occupations of LM-C and those of LM-B: circulating versus radiating mobility strategies and sea- sonally occupied residential locales in contrast to multiseasonal bases and sea- sonally employed logistical situations. No hominin remains are as yet known in association with the oldest facies (LM-D). (Similarly, the distinctive Hummalian industry, resembling LM-D, interstratified between Yabrudian and final Acheulean in central Syria still lacks associated human remains.) The distinc- tive Skhul/Qafzeh p-deme is associated, at the eponymous localities and at the Tabun type site (individual C2), with the LM-C facies. Representatives of the Neandertal p-deme are associated with the LM-B facies at sites in the south- ern Levant (Kebara, Tabun-B = C1 individual; Hayonim, Amud) and in the northern Levant (Ksar 'Akil, Lebanon, level xxv, individual KA-2; Dederiyeh Cave, Syria). Another sample of the west Asian Neandertal population is rep- resented in the Shanidar Cave (D upper and middle levels, 9 individuals in all) of Iraqi Kurdistan, in association with a distinctive Zagros Mousterian indus- try. In the succession of occurrences of this industry in the upper levels of Karain Cave (southwestern Taurus range, Turkey), Neandertal dentition has been recognized in levels 1.2-6. All Levantine Neandertals, and perhaps other west/central Asian Neandertals as well, purportedly fall within the earlier Pleniglacial of the Last Glacial. Iso- topic ages from Kebara (ESR, T/L) approximate 60-65 kya; those from Amud fall between 50 and 60 kya (T/L) and as little as 43 + 5 to 48 + 6 kya and 59 ?</page><page sequence="33">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 223 8 to 70 ? 8 kya (for different levels) by ESR. The range of ages for Tabun-B, from which the individual T-C1 very likely derived (see Table 6), vary accord- ing to the method employed and the appropriate correction factor applied. The earlier obtained 14C dates of between -46 and 50 kya for the Shanidar Cave level D occurrence very probably constitute minimum values. The Mousterian is becoming increasingly well known in parts of central Asia and in the adjacent Siberian Altai. The first known skeletal association, a juve- nile at Teshik-Tash Cave (southern Uzbekistan), occurs with a Levalloiso- Mousterian variant sometimes termed "Mountain Mousterian." It remains, unfortunately, undated. Remains of Neandertal morphology also occur at two among a number of Altai Mousterian sites, which, in fact, extend well into ad- jacent Mongolia. These include Peschera Denisova (2 teeth) in a Levalloiso- Mousterian association with a 14C age of -39,390 and Peschera Okladnikov (6 teeth of several individuals) in a typical Mousterian (non-Levallois) associa- tion with AMS ages of 33,500 ? 700 (level 3) and 37,750 ? 750 (level 2). No convincing evidence indicates the presence of representatives of a Neandertal p-deme in the Levant or greater western Asia overall until the ear- lier Upper Pleistocene (180 stage 4 and perhaps upper 5). This is in marked con- trast to the situation in Europe proper, including the Pontic area and apparently even the Caucasus. Thus, Neandertals are seemingly allochthonous and immi- grants into west Asia from their autochthonous source and broad distribution throughout Europe. Such shifts are still ill appreciated. They were, perhaps, a consequence of range displacement attendant on natural paleoclimatic factors, population factors, or even aspects of intergroup competition and aggression. In Europe, Neandertals are always associated with the Mousterian techno- complex. There are known associations in western Europe with most of the conventionally recognized facies, including Charentian, Typical, Denticulate, and, in west-central Italy, the so-called Pontinian. There are none, however, demonstrably associated with the Cantabrian Vasconian (or Olha-type Mous- terian) or with the Mousterian of Acheulean tradition (MTA). In central Eu- rope, associations are known with the Micoquian at the open site of Salzgitter and in the caves of Wildscheuer, Klausennische, and Kulna 7a. There are asso- ciations with the Taubachian at Taubach and Ehringsdorf in Thtiringia. Subalyuk, a Biikk Mountains cave, has a rare Neandertal association with the Charentian of the Balkan/Pannonian area. Neandertals are found with the Typical Mous- terian at the Sipka, Svedul stul, Krapina, and Vindija localities. With regard to the Krapina (Croatia) shelter, it should be noted that the best age assessment (by ESR) suggests, as long claimed on other grounds, an Eemian interglacial age (180 stage 5e), 130 ? 10 kya. At Krapina, Neandertal fossils with extensive evidence of deliberate breakage, cut marks, and other such damage, repre- senting multiple individuals, derive from levels 3-7. However, Neandertals, as demonstrated by their distinctive morphology, also persist into level 8 (skull parts of 2 juvenile individuals); claims made for their anatomical "modernity" are completely ill founded. The Kulna 7a occurrence has an age of -45,600 (14C) and 50,000 + 5,000 (ESR). Similarly, at Vindija, extensively fragmented</page><page sequence="34">224 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Neandertal skeletal parts derive from the lower G3 and the upper G1 levels. Neandertal teeth occur in Remete Fels6 Cave (Hungary) in association with the Jankovichian industry (ex-Transdanubian Szeletian), a distinctive Mous- terian with bifacial leaf points found at a cluster of sites below the great south- ward bend of the Danube. Another similar leaf point occurrence of this indus- try is at Dzeravi skaila (or Pilffy, western Slovakia), from which a juvenile's second molar, attributed to a Neandertal, was recovered long ago. Many expressions of the Mousterian technocomplex elsewhere in central and in eastern Europe are well documented archaeologically, but for these there are also only scant and rarely associated human remains. In the Crimea, such a diver- sity is well documented. At two of the Zaskalnaya (White Rock) sites, fragmentary adolescent and child remains respectively occur at sites Va and VI with the Micoquian-like "Ak-Kaya" industry, in the latter instance having a quite young AMS age of 30-31 kya. Other adult and child/infant remains occur at other caves in the Ak-Kaya massif. At Kiik-Koba the lower association is with a Taubachian-like industry. A fragmentary infant may possibly have occurred with the subsequent upper-level Kiik-Kobian, a Micoquian-like industry. In the northwest Caucasus south of the Kuban River, both open-air and rather numerous cave localities with Mousterian occupations are becoming better known. Four caves have afforded Neandertal remains: Mezmaiskaya, Monasheskaya, Barakaevskaya (cranial/gnathic parts of an infant in level 3), and Matuzka (both in levels with non-Levallois Typical Mousterian assemblages and in overlying Levalloiso-Mousterian levels). In Mezmaiskaya Cave there are four Mousterian occupation horizons: the lower pair (3, 2B) is of Micoquian affinity, and the upper pair (2, 2A) of perhaps Typical Mous- terian affinity. Neandertals occur in both lower (3) and upper (2) levels, repre- sented by cranial parts (in level 2) and a fetal or neonatal skeleton (in level 3). The latter occurrence is &gt; 45 kya ('4C), and succeeding levels have radiocarbon ages of 40,660 ? 1,600 (2B) and 35,760 + 400 and 36,280 + 540 (2A). Again, these last ages are within the span of the earlier (Aurignacian) Upper Paleolithic. Two occurrences in France demonstrate Neandertal presence in Chatelperron- ian industrial context. At Grotte du Renne, Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne), the lower (X) of five levels of this industry afforded 9 teeth and a juvenile temporal bone of indisputable Neandertal morphology. It has an AMS age of 33,820 ? 720; a higher level (VIII) has a 14C age of 33,000 ? 1,400. (However, IX has a conflicting and surprisingly great AMS date of 45,100 + 2,800.) The succeeding Aurignacian II occupation has a 14C age of 31,800 ? 1,240. The uppermost of some eight to ten antecedent Mousterian levels have 14C ages of (XI) 33,700 + 1,400 and (XII) 37,500 ? 1,600 (or 39,400 + 1,450 by AMS). Neandertal remains (3 teeth) are known from such Mousterian occupations in Schoeplin gallery, as well as from other levels at the adjacent Grotte du Loup and Grotte de l'Hy&amp;ne. At Saint C6saire (Charente Maritime), cranial and postcranial parts of an adult Neandertal individual occurred in the upper of two Chatelperronian occu- pations. The T/L age of the occurrence is 36,300 _ 2,700. Those industrial occurrences succeeded two MTA and three Denticulate horizons (the upper- most = 40,900 + 2,500 B.P.). The Chatelperronian levels were overlain by four</page><page sequence="35">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 225 Aurignacian occupations, the oldest of which (Ejo-6) dates to 32,100 ? 3,000 B.P. The Chatelperronian, considered here as the Mousterian/Chatelperronian industrial type, has a limited distribution in southern France (south of the Seine and largely south of the Loire) and occurs infrequently in Cantabrian (and prob- ably Catalonian) Spain. Over sixty occurrences are recorded, and over three dozen localities have afforded substantial and intact assemblages. A few isoto- pically age-determined occupations fall between -37 and 32 kya. Thus, this industrial type falls within the last half of the 180 stage 3 interval (between 45 and 32 kya) and most often in an interstadial amelioration (Denekamp or Les Cott s interstade). However, some localities in the north (Renne Cave in Yonne, Grand-Roche in Vienne) as well as several others in the south and near- Pyrenean regions occur in circumstances indicative of the subsequent early Pleniglacial. This industrial type always succeeds other Mousterian types/fa- cies-including Typical, Denticulate, and MTA-in localities which have such antecedent occupations. It has close overall fundamental linkages, both tech- nological and even typological, with MTA-B, a perspective long recognized by some workers, notably F. Bordes. (The geographic distributions of the MTA and Chatelperronian have long been recognized as remarkably coincident.) The Chatelperronian has a distinct reduction sequence, employing thick flakes or small slabs of raw material and exhibiting selection of blanks for production of various tool types, whether the distinctive Chatelperron points on regular blades or less regular blanks and even debitage products for other types. It is laminar, exhibits the soft hammer technique of blank production, and contains tool types of both Middle and Upper Paleotlithic typology in varying proportions, although the latter are not specifically Aurignacian. Chatelperron points, with some geo- metric variability and often trimmed for hafting, are distinctive. Occurrences which reflect workshop activities, hunting stations, and habitation occupations are re- flected among the known occurrences, which include some open sites as well as many cave fronts and shelters. There is some evidence to suggest more sub- stantial Mousterian techno-typological features in those Chatelperronian situa- tions which directly succeed other Mousterian occupations. Three localities are known in which Chatelperronian is reported to occur interstratified in relation to a specifically Upper Paleolithic industry, the Aurignacian. Their integrity vis-a- vis potential postdepositional disturbance and displacement has been questioned, specifically at Le Piage (Lot) and El Pendo (Cantabria). This question demands resolution, as in all other known occurrences, Aurignacian (Phase 0 or 1) always overlies the Chatelperronian. In my view, such occurrences seemingly demon- strate the independence of these industries as well as the pene-contemporaneity of such social and biological entities responsible for their production. The Chatelperronian of Grotte du Renne (as many as ten horizons in two beds) is among the best known, but it is remarkably culturally elaborated com- pared to the rest of the occurrences. It is well distinguished by its differential exploitation of lithic materials; genuine blade (prismatic core) technology; new and diverse lithic tool kit; use of and tool production from bone (N = 142); personal ornaments (N = 36) produced in place in shell, bone, tooth, and ivory; elaborated</page><page sequence="36">226 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH utilization and modification of cave front habitation space, including structure(s) and hearths; and distinctive patterns of exploitation of both ungulate and carnivore species. However, among Chatelperronian occurrences, Renne is not altogether unique. Employment of mammalian and avian bone and of ivory for tools and items of personal adornment (as at Quingay) is repeatedly claimed in the literature, if infrequently demonstrably present and then in lesser abundance. More than a few of these objects have counterparts in both form and technical procedure of produc- tion in Aurignacian assemblages in western and central Europe or in other indus- trial manifestations in eastern Europe. Thus, the influence of the Aurignacian- bearers on the Chatelperronian phenomenon cannot be too readily dismissed. Younger still than these Neandertal occurrences are several persistences of Mousterian into mid-Last Glacial times in southern Spain south of the Ebro Valley. Thus, at Zafarraya Cave (Mailaga), in which there are multiple Mous- terian occupations, Neandertal remains (mandible, dentition, etc.) are found in lower (E, D) and middle (B) levels dated to 31,800 B.P. (AMS) and 31,700 B.P. (Th/U) and to 33,400 B.P. (Th/U), respectively. Elsewhere, in Valencia, Andalucia, and Portugal there are demonstrably late, persistent occurrences of Mousterian industry in intact occupation sites. Falling within the last third of the aforesaid interval are occurrences in some dozen open-air localities and in four stratified cave occupations in Italy attributed to a distinctive industry, the Uluzzian. These occur in Tuscany, Campania, and Apulia. The open-air occurrences are problematic, perhaps variously representing mixed assemblages of some sort. The cave occupations, eight levels in all, differ to an extent among themselves, although their distinctiveness seems real enough overall. Stratigraphic evidence demonstrates a post-Mousterian and pre-Aurignacian stratigraphic position at several sites. Although dated occurrences are rare, the duration of the Uluzzian has been regarded as 33-34.5 kya and 33-31.5 kya. It is a flake-based industry with a low proportion of blades. It combines, variously and minimally, Middle Paleolithic forms (denticulates and notches, side-scrapers, scaled pieces) together with Upper Paleolithic (specifically Aurignacian) elements-vari- ous burins, end-scrapers (including steep and nosed forms), retouched blades (in- cluding Aurignacian types), some backed pieces, and the distinctive (and epony- mous) angular to curved backed knives. Coloring minerals and worked bone (points) also occur. Only two deciduous molars (at Carvallo Cave) are known in such a context, and at least one of these is demonstrably Neandertal. The total body of current evidence quite clearly indicates (1) the unexpectedly late persistence in certain situations of Neandertals, (2) temporal overlap of some Neandertals and the earliest Cro-Magnon populations, and, most importantly, (3) the ultimate displacement/replacement of the Neandertals by Cro-Magnon peoples. Cro-Magnon and the Early Upper Paleolithic Record of Western Eurasia This p-deme subsumes human populations of western Eurasia of late Upper Pleistocene age. Its members are invariably associated with Upper Paleolithic industries. The oldest representatives of this p-deme in Europe are all associated with</page><page sequence="37">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 227 the Aurignacian technocomplex. The Aurignacian is now known to date sub- stantially earlier than was formerly envisioned. Ages in excess of 40,000 B.P. (conventional 14C, AMS, some T/L determinations) have been obtained from such occurrences in Bulgaria (Temnata-4, Bacho Kiro-11, Samulica) and in Hungary (Istallosko-9). Some such occurrences in Bulgaria have been attrib- uted to a distinctive industry, Bachokirian. The lower of two Aurignacian lev- els at the Trou Magrite Cave (Wallonia) is now known also to have an age around 40,000 B.P. In the northern Iberian peninsula (Romani-2, Arbreda-B1, Castillo-18, Reclau Viver-III/27), a number of occurrences have slightly younger ages, between 35-36,000 and 40,000 B.P. A later group has isotopic dates from around 34-35 kya in Hungary (Pesk6), in Austria (Krems-Hundsteig, Willendorf- 3), in southern Germany (Geissenkl6sterle-15/16), in Belgium (Trou Magrite- 2), and in southern France (Pataud-14, Ferrassie-K6, Flageolet-11, St. Cesaire- Ejo, and Esquicho SLC-lb). The former group of occurrences might be informally termed Proto-Aurignacian, and the latter group Basal Aurignacian. The oldest known occurrences yield very fragmentary human remains at only three localities (Bacho Kiro-11, Istallosko-9, Castillo-18). The next younger localities all lack associated human remains. Most human remains having Aurignacian industrial associations are from situations in caves and shelters commonly referred to as the so-called Middle Aurignacian and having isotopic ages between around 31,000 and 35,000 B.P. (to be considered as minimal ages). In Aquitaine there are three phases (fa- cies) of this industry-"O" (Dufour) type, Castanet type, and Ferrassie type. Cranial remains with Aurignacian associations are largely from central Europe and include those from Vogelherd-V (Baden-Wiirttemberg; including also an ulna), Velika Pecina (Croatia), Koneprusy (Bohemia), and Mladec or Lautsch (Moravia; more than a dozen individuals, including postcranials). Associated 14C ages are 30,162-31,900 B.P. (Vogelherd-V) and &gt;33,850 ? 520 B.P. (Velika Pecina). Other individual specimens, without industrial associations but ap- propriately considered of broadly comparable age, are those of (perhaps) Svitavka (Moravia) and the frontal from Han6fersand (Elbe River) (age 35,000- 36,300 B.P.). Of many such sites, 20 in France, 1 in Italy, 3 in Germany, 1 in Croatia, and 2 in Moravia have human associations, but often fragmentary, un- fortunately. These all represent Homo sapiens sapiens. Although sometimes claimed otherwise, there is nothing "transitional" or "intermediate" in respect to their morphology in any, repeat any, instance. Contrary claims simply have not stood up to verification. Similarly, a claim for a conjoint occurrence of Aurignacian-like bone artifacts with a few unquestionable Neandertal remains in an otherwise ill-defined assemblage at Vindija Cave (Croatia) level G1 (be- tween Mousterian and Aurignacian levels) is less than convincing due to evi- dence of substantial cryoturbation disturbance. Our conception of the Aurignacian technocomplex has been altered in re- cent years from the linear and stadial frameworks proposed in the first half of this century. There is now greatly enhanced knowledge of its geographic dis- tributional aspects and of its composition and variability. This knowledge is</page><page sequence="38">228 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH derived from substantial, diverse assemblages from well-controlled stratigraphic contexts, from new or reexcavation of long occupation sequences (e.g., the Perigord shelters of Abri Pataud and La Ferrassie), from extensive application of isotopic dating methods, and from the study of many, often rich, paleoenviron- mental records. In those situations in which Mousterian occupations are also evidenced, Aurignacian always succeeds Mousterian, of whatever facies; and, correspondingly, occurrences of the latter are almost always of at least some- what greater antiquity. There are many localities in western Europe in which the "Chatelperronian industry" is adequately defined and stratigraphically de- lineated. Many have antecedent Mousterian occupations, and still more also have succeeding Aurignacian occupation(s) as well. In nearly all (30), Aurigna- cian (AUR) overlies the Chatelperronian (CH) occurrence. There are, however, three well-published situations-two in Aquitanian France, one in Cantabrian Spain-in which industrial interstratification occurs. At Roc de Combe (Lot, France) there are successive CH (level 10) --+AUR "0" (level 9) -&gt;CH (level 8)-*AUR I (level 7) occupations. The Chatelperronian of level 8 has a 14C age of 38,000 ? 2,000 B.P. At Le Piage (Lot, France) there are AUR (levels K, J, G- I)-&gt;CH (level F1)-4AUR (level F) occupations. At El Pendo (Cantabria), analo- gously, the sequence is AUR "O" (level VIII b, a)-~CH (level VIII)--AUR I (level VI). Unfortunately, none of these caves yielded associated human skel- etal remains in these occupational circumstances. In Morin Cave (Cantabria), near El Pendo, there is a long sequence of Mousterian occupations (seven levels of two facies). These are succeeded by a well-defined Chatelperronian level (14C = 36,950 + 6,777), followed by five successive Aurignacian occupa- tions, the upper three representing AUR I (with an age of 32,415) and AUR II. The underlying levels are at least Basal Aurignacian typologically, with mis- leadingly young 14C ages (-28 kya). The upper of these contains traces ("ghosts") of disintegrated human corpses, at least one of which is of modern human size and proportions. A complex of Upper Paleolithic (UP) industries succeed the west Asian Mousterian subsequent to -45-47 thousand years ago. This post-Mousterian basal UP interface is slightly older than any occurrence known in Europe. There is some evidence, notably in the Negev and in the northern Levant, for pro- gressive technological shifts in core-reduction processes, in the production of blade blanks, and in the introduction and elaboration of newer tool types and variants, all from a dominantly Mousterian/Levallois facies base. There is, un- fortunately, only a scant, poorly preserved human fossil record associated with this important industrial succession. These roots of the UP complex are best illuminated in the northern Levant (Lebanon; Ksar 'Akil, levels xxv-xxi) and in the Negev of the southernmost Levant (Boker Tachtit, level 4). It is appropri- ate to denominate these occurrences as an Initial Upper Paleolithic, funda- mentally not so dissimilar from the industry once termed Emiran and recog- nized in occupations from the Emireh, El-Wad (F/G), Qafzeh (E), and Tabban (B) Caves. In each instance, and subsequently at Ksar 'Akil (levels xx-xviii), significant additions to the lithic technological repertoire are manifest, as are</page><page sequence="39">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 229 also certain important innovations in tool kit variety and composition. Human skeletal associations are unknown with these oldest Levantine UP occurrences. The p-demic identity of subsequent Levantine population samples is specifi- cally Homo sapiens. So far as evidence affords a basis for judgment, particular affinities are with broadly contemporaneous European populations-the Cro- Magnons. The oldest occurrences of human cranial remains are apparently those at the caves of Erq el-Ahmar (E) and Qafzeh-D in unnamed "UP-II" con- texts (to employ a former terminology). An occurrence of a juvenile cranium at Ksar 'Akil (level xvii, specimen KA-1) is in an Ahmarian-like UP context and is purportedly &gt;35-40 kya in age. Most other occurrences, as at El Wad (D), Kebara (E, D), and Hayonim-D, are in Levantine Aurignacian (formerly Antelian) contexts, all &lt;40 kya in age. It is sometimes held that this distinct industry, which both persists for some 15-16 thousand years and is seemingly pene- contemporaneous with the typologically distinctive Ahmarian, was intrusive into west Asia from a Balkans source. The best-preserved and most complete Levantine UP hominin, a buried skeleton from Nahal 'En-Gev, is associated with a late manifestation of this same UP industry. Final and immediately post- Pleistocene populations would appear to have their ancestral roots largely in the late Pleistocene of this same region. The Upper Paleolithic is much less well known elsewhere in southwest or central Asia. Notable exceptions are the occurrence of the Baradostian at Shanidar in Iraqi Kurdistan (minimally dated at -35,000 B.P.) and the only slightly (if at all) younger Kara-Kamar oc- currence (Afghanistan). Human remains are unknown in either instance. A consensus has emerged in respect to the distinctive nature and signifi- cance of the Aurignacian in the establishment of the west Eurasian Upper Pa- leolithic industrial complex. The Aurignacian technocomplex, almost a cen- tury after its incontrovertible recognition and stratigraphic fixation, appropriately stands at the base of the UP complex. The Aurignacian sensu lato exhibits a remarkably extensive distribution-northern central Asia, southwestern Asia, and throughout continental Europe, including the southern British Isles. It is notably absent in northern Africa, except for a single outlier in Cyrenaican Libya (the Dabban industry of Haua Fteah Cave). This distribution apparently altered through time, leading to several instances of intensive provincial settle- ment and resource exploitation. On the basis of mean isotopic age assessments, Aurignacian occurrences in Europe span minimally some 15 thousand years. An apparently diminishing age cline of occurrences (older to younger) extends from southeast Europe, to south-central Europe, to northern Iberia, and thence to northern Italy and into southwest France. Largely in western Europe, there is demonstrable age over- lap and interstratification with Charentian type occurrences, as well as other evidence indicative of Mousterian industrial groups contemporaneous with some Aurignacian occurrences. Certain occurrences in northern central Asia and in Cyrenaica apparently have an antiquity nearly as great as those of eastern Eu- rope. The former, in particular, include important stratified sites in the Altai (Kara-Bom -43,200 B.P., Strashnaya Cave; Maloyalomanskaya Cave), Khakasia</page><page sequence="40">230 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (Malaya Syyu), and Cis-Baikal (Makarova-4; Varvarina Gora; Sanngy Mys; Tolbaga). The Aurignacian lacks suitable industrial antecedents within most (or all) of Europe. Its roots are often considered to have flourished elsewhere, possibly within greater western Asia. One likely source is an "early" manifestation of Levantine Levalloiso-Mousterian as epitomized in the ancient occurrence at Mt. Carmel (Tabun-D type) and by similar manifestations of lesser antiquity at localities in the northern Levant (Ksar 'Akil, Abou Halka in Lebanon), in the southern Levant (Boker Tachtit), and also in Jordan. The successive occupa- tions revealed at the Ksar 'Akil shelter (levels xxv-xx in particular) and at Boker Tachtit (levels 1-4) document the nature and process of autochthonous techno-typological transformation from a type of Middle Paleolithic (Tabun-D type) to a form of Upper Paleolithic (Ahmarian, or an early manifestation of Aurignacian). The timing of this emergence can only be imperfectly estimated, perhaps between -50-45 kya B.P. In the Levant, the UP slightly precedes its otherwise oldest known appearance (in Balkan Europe). Unfortunately, there is a paucity of relevant information from the whole of Anatolia. On the other hand, early UP occupation (&gt;46-41 kya B.P.) is evidenced at several sites in southern Siberia and the Altai (Kara-Bom, Makarovo-4, etc.). The Aurignacian complex evinces substantial "cultural" homogeneity over its very extensive distribution. There is seemingly little distinguishable regional differentiation. In comparison with "Typical" Aurignacian manifestations of de- monstrably younger age, which were first recognized in southern France and in Cantabrian Spain, some temporal differentiation is manifest in the earliest Aurignacian as evidenced in the employment of different terminologies for ear- lier-known occurrences (dubbed as "basal," "archaic," "proto"), including also the Balkan Bachokirian and "Olschewian," which often constitute transient hunt- ing and carcass-processing stations. Similarly, the Ahmarian and Levantine Aurignacian (former Antelian) are largely successively distinctive industries in the Levant, and the Baradostian is a not dissimilar manifestation in the Zagros foothills and environs. All exhibit a number of distinctive UP techno-typological innovations, which increase and diversify over time and are coincident with suc- cessive reductions and/or loss of Middle Paleolithic elements. The Aurignacian complex is consistently and uniquely found in association with human populations representative of Homo sapiens. In Europe there are at least 55 substantiated occurrences. The majority are associations with the geo- logically younger "Typical" Aurignacian-the well-known Cro-Magnon people. Occurrences in Bulgaria, Croatia, Ligurian Italy, and Cantabrian Spain, and then only of fragmentary cranial parts, are demonstrably associated with the anteced- ent, oldest Aurignacian; in all instances, the morphology is that of Homo sapiens. Of broadly comparable antiquity are the Levantine Ahmarian occurrences, 3 in number and each with fragmentary cranial parts, similarly referable to Homo sapiens. Consequently, the Aurignacian complex is allochthonous to much of Europe and is quite abrupt in its appearance there. Inferentially, it is a manifesta- tion of population growth, expansion, and colonization; empirically, it represents</page><page sequence="41">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 231 social and technological change. This perspective is not new, but it is supported strongly by a large and diverse body of evidence. Aurignacian lithic technology exhibits the persistence of some traditional Middle Paleolithic production procedures, the introduction of new tool types associated with significant Upper Paleolithic production innovations, and diversification of artifact groups and of the new tool types. The extensive employment of prismatic core platforms, common use of the punch technique, and attendant production of blades exemplify this transformation, in conjunction with flake production employ- ing hard hammer methods. The margins of several types/shapes of blanks are sub- mitted to diverse retouches-varyingly steep, scalariform, high lamellar, lateral blunting, terminal and marginal burin blow(s)-according to preferred end-prod- uct and requisite use. The expansion of and standardization within lithic categories is epitomized in the scraper and burin groups, in the varied development and treat- ment of marginally retouched blades, and in the proliferation in retouched bladelet categories and associated point production (Dufour, Font-Yves, Krems, el-Wad, etc., types). There are attendant hafting and mounting procedures, all deduced by inference, as the organic component materials are rarely preserved. There is an extensive employment of organic hard parts, including bone, ivory, teeth, and particularly antler. This technology produces a diversity of distinctive antler point forms, standardized according to treatment of base and tip and form of cross-section. These constitute a significant, innovative projec- tile weaponry also involving complex hafting and binding methods. Other os- seous products include spatulate pieces, polishers, chisels, wedges, and awls. Diverse activities and actions are employed in these (and other) productions: e.g., cutting, incising, splitting, wedging, controlled percussion, grinding, and polishing, as well as perforation, gouging, and drilling. Artistic and decorative expressions are seemingly first commonly practiced within Aurignacian industrial contexts. These are largely, though not exclu- sively, clustered in Aquitanian France and the Alpine forelands of central Eu- rope. Mobiliary items are most often expressed in media afforded by animal hard parts, notably teeth, ivory, bone, and, more rarely, antler. Perforated teeth of both ungulate and carnivore species and exotic shell may be abundant. Ivory and shell beads, the former produced through an elaborate, multistage process employing well-defined steps of manufacture, are locally common. Other pro- ductions comprise statuettes and figurines (both zoo- and anthropomorphic); zoomorphic pendant-like objects; and incised, notched, and punctuated bone shafts and segments (plaques), with both abstract motifs and repetitive, time- transgressive patterns only explicable within the framework of notational schemas, some likely calendrical in function. Shelter walls or derivative fallen blocks may exhibit geometric or stylized quasi-zoomorphic outlines and im- ages created through pecking, engraving, and/or imposed coloration. At least one instance of realistic, figurative animal art (Chauvet Cave) specifically dates from late or "Typical" Aurignacian times. Any and all such expressions have no incontrovertible Middle Paleolithic ante- cedents. These are expressions of individual and group social identity and perhaps</page><page sequence="42">232 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH also denotations of hierarchically structured social systems previously unevidenced in the record. The manifestations of already complex symbolic ideational systems are often interpreted in the context of ritual and ceremonial behavior. Fundamental to evaluation of the Aurignacian as the earliest expression of the European Upper Paleolithic is an elucidation of settlement system, land and resource use, subsistence practices within a foraging spectrum, and demo- graphics. Many assertions and evaluations have been put forward concerning the transformation of such adaptations and lifeways in respect to a purported, antecedent Middle Paleolithic state. Thus, early Upper Paleolithic organizational patterns have been considered to be "qualitatively different" and to constitute the initial manifestation of a "creative explosion." Sites, whether cave, shelter, or open-air, show an overall increase in number and are of different types and sizes, in contrast to the "fewer," "small," "amorphous," and "homogeneous" sites in the Middle Pale- olithic. Moreover, settlement may occur in different and additional regions, in contrast to prior limited settlement and "strict regionalization." There is ex- pansion in exploitation, extraction, and utilization of exotic resources (stone, shell, etc.), in contrast to almost exclusive employment of local resources in the Middle Paleolithic. In respect to provender, in the Upper Paleolithic there is enhanced transport and, presumptively, development of storage methods/ facilities, in contrast to minimal transport and little or no demonstrable storage in the Middle Paleolithic. Prey procurement involved "organizationally com- plex" and "variable" hunting, with more "specialized" and "strategic" prac- tices and employment of innovative projectile technologies, in contrast to pur- ported nonconfrontational scavenging and broadly based, eclectic hunting strategies, both opportunistic as well as in ambush situations. Demographic parameters are reflected in overall increased population size, greater regional population densities, and larger, more permanent social groupings in the Up- per Paleolithic, in contrast to smaller, more local, partially isolated, and "habi- tat-bound" aggregates, extensive group mobility, and frequent practice of sea- sonal rounds and associated shifts in annual range in the Middle Paleolithic. SUMMATION In this overview the focus has been twofold-recognition of the preponder- ance of evidence, particularly that afforded from molecular biology, for the recency of modern human (Homo sapiens) origins and demonstration of the existence, since the earliest Pleistocene, of a succession of ancient popula- tions, morphologically distinct and exhibiting particular spatio-temporal distribu- tions, the known samples of which constitute p-demes. These distinguishable units constitute the hominin fossil record and are the basis for the elucidation of phylogenetic relationships, events, dispersals, extinctions, and changes re- flective of anagenesis or cladogenesis. Such units afford the basis, if any, for the delineation of regional clades and hence for the formal recognition, as ap- propriate, of formal species-level taxa.</page><page sequence="43">THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENUS HOMO 233 The roots of Homo are in Africa, from which the earliest known species, H. ergaster, of Lower Pleistocene age is recognized. Dispersal(s) of its popula- tions through range extension afforded the initial hominin population of west- ern, southern, and continental Asia and of Europe, presumably in that order. Ancient hominin populations of eastern and southern (Sundaland) Asia ex- hibit demonstrable affinities with their original African source. However, there are consistent and persistent morphological distinctions between p-demes of the several regions, evidently the consequence of evolutionary history, includ- ing drift, and of the effect of prolonged isolation. Hence it is appropriate to consider formal recognition, at the species level, of continental (H. pekinensis) and peninsular (H. erectus and probably antecedents as well) Asian taxa. In the last instance there is demonstrable persistence (as H. soloensis) well into the Upper Pleistocene of representatives of this latter clade. Its persistence is within the temporal interval of the initial peopling of Sahulland (over a sub- stantial water gap) by H. sapiens colonizers. Only glimmerings are known of the initial peopling of Europe. This event is documented at least within the late Lower Pleistocene. Hence, there is a longer colonization history than has sometimes been imagined. Hominin remains oc- cur in both Iberia and the Apennine peninsula, as do artifact occurrences both there and elsewhere in western and central Europe. The source and route of dispersal into the continent is problematic; but dispersal through western Asia, rather than from the Maghreb to Iberia across the Strait of Gibraltar, is more likely on various grounds. These initial occupants, H. antecessor, have African affinities and derived morphological features. The linkages and affiliations, if any, with subsequent populations are scarcely known at all. However, by some 0.5 mya, a Neandertal clade (H. heidelbergensis/H. neanderthalensis) is distin- guishable. The clade progressively differentiated in an accretionary fashion over the ensuing several hundred thousand years. Neandertal populations were displaced, coexisted with, and ultimately were replaced in western Eurasia by H. sapiens (Cro-Magnon paleo-deme) between -40 and 30 kya. There is no direct evidence for successful gene exchange, and limited genetic evidence in fact now contraindicates such a relationship. This replacement was seemingly not a sudden "event," however momentous, but it must have been recurrent and persistent over upwards of 10-15 thousand years. The roots of modern humans (Homo sapiens) are specifically African, in a broad sense, and on that continent they must reach back to some 0.3-0.4 mya. The African fossil record is less informative until more or less half that age, when presumptive ancestors are represented by several p-demes disparately widespread over the continent, ultimately impinging upon the Levant. A dis- tinctive Levantine (Skhul/Qafzeh) p-deme, with African roots, is known there from -100 kya, although it was perhaps displaced (temporarily) by allochthonous Neandertals early in the Last Glacial age. Neandertals are unknown in the Le- vant after -45-40 kya, an earlier time than their disappearance from the west- ern and far eastern peripheries of their maximum range. Neither molecular biology nor the hominin fossil record lend an iota of sup-</page><page sequence="44">234 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH port to the hypothesis dubbed multiregional evolution. The incommensurabil- ity in perspective between a few versus the preponderance of students of hominin evolution largely mirrors major differences in epistemology. This has been and will continue to be a difficult hurdle to surmount. An ever-enhanced body of empirical evidence reveals, as elsewhere in mammalian evolution, that hominin evolution exemplifies dispersals, isolation, regional clades, extinctions, effects of genetic drift, population displacements and bottlenecks, and the re- petitive effects of cyclical paleoclimatic perturbations instrumental in distribu- tional, demographic, and adaptational aspects of Pleistocene hominin lifeways.
