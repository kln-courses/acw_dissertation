<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION Dane Scott Abstract The ideal of an ecological community uniting humans to the earth is an important normative ideal in environmental ethics. In this paper I will briefly look at one of the more popular stories that provides the philosophical underpinnings for this ideal. This is the story told by Baird Callicott, through his interpretation of Leopold's land ethic. In the critical portion of this essay, I point to problems with this account. The goal is not to prove this story false, but to indicate its inadequacies. In the constructive portion, I will discuss the philosophical underpinnings for an alterna- tive story for realizing the hoped-for ecological community from the perspective of the Judeo-Christian tradition. This alternative story relies on an account of moral agency found in the narrative ethics of Alasdair Maclntrye. But it also reclaims neglected insights from Josiah Royce. In this account a community narrative is required that formed through a dialogue between the scientifically informed idea of the ecological community and the Judeo-Christian narrative of creation. Keywords-, creation narrative, ecological community, epistemological crises, commu- nity ethics Introduction For over thirty years now, ever since the publication of Lynn White's provocative essay, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis," critics have charged that religious communities rooted in the bibli- cal narrative of creation cannot be ecological communities (White 1967: 1203-7). It is said that the biblical creation narrative promotes a pathological, dualistic worldview. That is, it places humans above and outside the ecological community, not a part of and alongside the rest of the ecological community as indicated by ecological evo- lution. The result of this dualistic and hierarchical worldview is thoughtless environmental destruction and degradation. These charges contain important truths and insights. Nonetheless, this paper will argue that it is important not to abandon the creation narrative. Rather, the creation narrative is essential in working toward a Judeo- Christian environmental ethics that places humans within the eco- logical community. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2003 Worldviews 7,1-2 113-135 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">114 DANE SCOTT In broad terms, what follows is a sketch of a general approach to a process that was sparked by environmentalists' critique of dualism in biblical tradition. Through this process, many thoughtful people confront an epistemological crisis caused by their tradition's culpability in environmental degradation and by the facts of modern biology. Dualism and the Epistemological Crisis in the Judeo-Christian Tradition In general terms, an epistemological crisis occurs when a commu- nity's (or tradition's) schema (or narrative) for interpreting the world and guiding its practices breaks down in some crucial way. This breakdown is caused by new events or facts that conflict with the community's formational and action-guiding narrative.1 Two related issues are readily identified as primary causes for the present epis- temological crisis: The first, as indicated above, is the culpability of the biblical tradition in thoughdess environmental destruction. The second is the apparent conflict between the Judeo-Christian tradi- tion's interpretation of the earth-human relationship and that given by modern biology. Both of these factors converge in the tradition's interpretation of the creation narrative. The first undermines the eth- ical legitimacy of the biblical tradition. The second explains why this is the case, by pointing out the pathological dualism inherent in the biblical narrative, which seems to legitimize human domination of nature. However, the answer is not to reject out of hand all dual- istic interpretations in favor of some form of ecological holism, as is common in environmental philosophy. Rather, a more reflective and self-critical dualistic interpretation of the earth-human relationship may best fit the facts and serve as a practical guide for environ- mental ethics. In sum, it is a mistake to replace the misguided dual- istic interpretation of earth-human relationship with a misguided holistic interpretation.2 Nonetheless, affirming dualism in an environmental philosophy may seem like trying to revive Ptolemaic astronomy. The dominant trend has been toward some form of holism. Within this trend, one direction is to develop an a-religious, scientifically inspired ecocen- tric or biocentric holism. Another direction is to develop a holism that integrates a variety of spiritual insights with a holistic interpre- tation of science. The second trend, sometimes labeled "reconstruc- tionist", remains nominally tied to the Judeo-Christian tradition.</page><page sequence="3">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 1 1 5 However, it breaks with mainstream historical Judeo-Christian thought. With regard to Christian reconstructionists, Paul Santmire writes that, "[they] take it as a given that traditional Christian thought offers few if any viable theological resources to help people of faith respond to our global environmental crisis" (Santmire 2000). Further, he com- ments that the "reconstructionists fail to connect with the core convic- tions of the Christian community" (Ibid.). Unlike the above approaches, the goal here is to remain within the historical Judeo-Christian tra- dition by retaining, but reinterpreting, the dualism at the heart of the biblical tradition. There are at least two important reasons for not breaking with the historical Judeo-Christian tradition. The first is pragmatic. Far from declining in influence, the Judeo-Christian tradition is in a period of rapid expansion around the globe, particularly in the devel- oping world - where large-scale environmental problems are becom- ing increasingly acute. Moreover, this growth tends to be in more conservative forms of Christianity (Jenkins 2002). By way of con- trast, the more liberal forms of Christianity that might adopt the reconstructionsts' program are in sharp decline. Hence, if the major- ity of the 2.6 billion Christians that will populate the world by 2025 are to adopt an environmental ethic, then that ethic must remain within the framework of historical Christianity. The second reason has to do with the integrity of belief. Hopefully, most of these Christians adopt their faith because they believe its message is true. However, if they are to keep the integrity of their beliefs, they must also accept responsibility for the moral failures of historical Christianity. In the case at hand, this means accepting responsibility for the tradition's role in environmental degradation. It is an easy task to point out the hypocrisy in a biblical interpre- tation that would justify greed and thoughtless environmental destruc- tion. In taking responsibility for the moral failures of the tradition, believers must reexamine their interpretation of the tradition. Hence, there is clearly an opening for the Judeo-Christian tradition to reform itself, and there are overwhelming indications that this process is well underway.</page><page sequence="4">116 DANE SCOTT Approaches to Relating Science and Religion and thár Implications for Developing a Judeo- Christian Environmental Ethic For many environmentalists modern biology is seen as a construc- tive refutation of the dualistic and hierarchical picture that the bib- lical creation narrative paints. This conflict between modern biology and the biblical tradition has long created difficulties for the more general problem of relating science and religion. It seems that these two issues are related on the most basic level. Therefore, a good starting point for this inquiry is to look at approaches people are using to relate science to religion, with the idea that they will provide direction for relating environmental ethics to a Judeo-Christian ethics. Ian Barbour provides four categories for discussing the various ways of relating science and religion (Barbour 1997: 77-103). These categories are: conflict, independence, dialogue and integration (Ibid.: 77). Within these categories there are further subdivisions. Because of the length of this paper I will focus on reasons for preferring a narrative approach to dialogue over independence or conflict. It should be noted that there are interesting possibilities for integra- tion, but this approach requires the development of speculative meta- physical systems - a project that is currendy not likely to have a wide appeal. So while important options will be covered, the following discussion is necessarily limited in scope. With this in mind, I will proceed by briefly describing the approaches of independence and conflict in relation to the biblical creation narrative and discuss their implications for relating environmental ethics to Judeo-Christian ethics. Independence From the perspective of independence, science and religion are seen as dealing with essentially different issues in separate domains. Further, each domain has its own methods that are justified within its sphere (Ibid.: 84). In general, this approach retreats from the biblical cre- ation narrative. Historically, independence gained acceptance as a way of saving religion from the corrosive effects of modern science on historic faith. Some believed that by limiting the scope of the biblical tradition to issues dealing with human salvation, religion would no longer run into conflict with science. The sphere of God's action concerns salvation history, not nature (Ibid.: 85). This, of</page><page sequence="5">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 1 1 7 course, creates problems for developing a Judeo-Christian environ- mental ethic. It seems evident that an environmental ethic - Jewish, Christian, or otherwise - needs to be at least minimally in dialogue with the natural sciences. The Christian theologian Claus Westermann provided an early environmentalist critique of those who sought to save religion from science by building a wall of separation. The price of independence was abandoning what Scripture had to say about creation. For Westermann it was a gross error to retreat from the biblical state- ments on creation in the face of the growing conflicts with modern science (Westermann 1984: 90-101). By retreating from the creation narrative, Christian theology became overly focused on the salvation of the individual soul, without reference to the larger history of cre- ation. Westermann comments on the results of abandoning the bib- lical creation narrative: This means that God is not concerned with a worm being trodden to the earth or with the appearance of a new star in the Milky Way. And so the question must be put: what sort of God is he who does everything for the salvation of man but clearly has nothing at all to do with man in his life situation? (Ibid.: 92) The neglect of the creation narrative perhaps played an important role in the complicity of Christians in environmental degradation. That is, by neglecting the common origins of all creation in the inclusive process of genesis, the tradition lost its essential link to the rest of nature. Ironically, contra White, in some sense it may have been the neglect or retreat from the biblical creation narrative that is at the root of our current ecological crisis.3 Therefore, if this line of thinking is correct, then the general approach of independence holds little promise for developing a Judeo-Christian environmental ethic. Conflict From the perspective of conflict, religion and science are seen as making contradictory claims about the nature of reality. This approach leads to a stark choice. Barbour sees scientific materialism making one of these choices and biblical literalism making the opposite (Ibid.: 78). At one pole, the biblical literalists, of course, affirm a literal</page><page sequence="6">118 DANE SCOTT reading of the creation narrative. Hence they dismiss the environ- mentalists' critique of the dualism inherent in the biblical tradition from the standpoint of ecological evolution.4 They also dismiss the normative ideal of the ecological community, in which humans are seen as part of the earth's natural systems. As stated earlier, this posi- tion leads to obvious hypocrisies that have long been pointed out. At the other pole, the creation narrative is dismissed as misguided and superfluous in light of ecological evolution. In this view attempts are made to construct a purely naturalistic environmental ethics, inspired by a holistic interpretation of modern biology. Baird Callicott, while not a scientific materialist, provides one of the more influential, thoroughly naturalistic environmental ethics. He does this as he expounds and expands on Aldo Leopold's land ethic. While Callicott has offered several versions of this story over the course of his prolific career, a terse outline of the dominant one might read as follows: We humans, as social animals, have been equipped through evolu- tionary history with moral sentiments, which motivate us to act altru- istically toward those individuals and things we recognize as belonging to our community, or social group. This notion is combined with Leopold's well-known interpretation of the history of ethics as an ever-expanding, more inclusive sphere of moral consideration. The sphere of moral consideration expands as we become enlightened as to who and what belongs to our community. Once we see that included within our community is "the land" (Leopold's inclusive term for all of the biospheric systems) we are open to being moved by the moral sentiments to act altruistically toward the land.5 Hence, the existence of the "moral sentiments" is a necessary condition for realizing the normative goal of the ecological community. However, it is not a sufficient condition. It must be magnified and directed through an enlightened ecological education.6 The question is, can this naturalistic account of the creation of the hoped-for ecological community achieve its goals? Perhaps, though, there are problems with this story.7 The major difficulty is that this naturalistic account does not pro- vide an adequate explanation of how to realize the normative ideal of the ecological community. The hope is that human communities will begin to see themselves as belonging to a larger ecological com- munity. This calls for a cultural transformation. One reason Callicott's explanation for this transformation is inadequate is that he abol- ishes the key distinction between nature and culture. In so doing,</page><page sequence="7">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 119 he diminishes the importance of processes that are best described as cultural, as distinct from natural processes. Over the last several years Callicott and Holmes Rolston have been debating whether or not there should be a division between nature and culture in environ- mental ethics. On one side of the debate, Callicott is anxious to avoid any form of dualism, as he sees this as an important factor causing environ- mental crises. Hence, he is highly critical of Rolston, who does dis- tinguish between nature and culture. Callicott primarily argues that Rolston, being an ordained minister, has been unable to free him- self from the dualism inherent in the Christian tradition. In contrast, Callicott announces: "I follow Darwin in thinking that human cul- ture is continuous with primate and mammalian protoculture". (Callicott 1998: 387-94). Callicott's commitment to a thoroughgoing naturalistic, metaphysical holism leads him to make some odd asser- tions. For example, he writes: We are animals ourselves, large omnivorous primates, very precocious to be sure, but just big monkeys, nevertheless. We are therefore a part of nature, not set apart from it. Chicago is no less a phenomenon of nature than is the Great Barrier Reef (Callicott 1992: 17). In everyday language one would never say that Chicago is a nat- ural phenomenon. That is, language must be removed from ordi- nary use, in light of metaphysical commitments, to say that the products of Chicago's industry, such as "compact disks and Styrofoam cups" are natural in the same way as "coral reefs with their polyps and fishes" (Rolston 2002: 108). As he is not committed to a natu- ralistic, metaphysical holism, Rolston sees no reason why we should not trust our everyday language; it seem to be making an impor- tant distinction here. So on the other side of the debate, Rolston argues that abolish- ing the distinction between nature and culture is a mistake. First, he demonstrates, in "naturalizing everything one delimits nothing" (Ibid.). When one dissolves the distinction between nature and culture it becomes impossible to "mark off what happens in wild spontaneous nature from what happens as a result of humans in their cultural activities" (Ibid.). Nonetheless, this distinction has proven to be extremely helpful in informing and guiding environmental ethics. It should be reformed, but not abandoned. The second part of Rolston's argument is that the nature/culture</page><page sequence="8">1 20 DANE SCOTT distinction is not arbitrary; there are legitimate reasons for making such a division, the most important being that culture has "significantly evolved out of nature" (Ibid.: 110). In doing so, culture has intro- duced "emergent novelties not previously seen in wild nature" (Ibid.). One of these novelties has to do with the way and the rate infor- mation moves in culture as opposed to nature. Rolston comments that, "Information in wild nature travels intergenerationally on genes; information in culture travels neurally as persons are educated into transmissible cultures" (Ibid.). The important point to draw from the nature /culture distinction is that if ethical communities are largely a cultural, linguistic phe- nomenon, they must be understood in that context. Obviously, as social animals, humans have a genetic predisposition for behaviors that promote the inclusive reproductive fitness of the species. Further, our innate sociability is, no doubt, at least one of many necessary but insufficient conditions for the creation of ethical communities. Ethical communities are the product of a diverse array of natural and cultural factors. This explains why they are so widely varied. Members of such communities pursue such diverse concepts as free- dom, equality, justice, purity, charity, poverty, celibacy, monastic rule, human rights, animal rights and the ecological community. Hence, a story of the formation of the ecological community needs to focus on how language works in culture to form ethical communities. The alternative story that will be used in the second part of this paper is one in which ethical communities are understood as result- ing from language as it gives rise to personal and community iden- tities through shared narratives. When complex linguistic communities emerge, they weave language into narratives. These narratives are used to create ethical identities for groups and individuals within these groups. These statements are little more than assertions that hint at a line of argument. Nonetheless, they set the stage for an alternative account of the adoption of the ethical ideal of the eco- logical community by Judeo-Christian communities. This alternative account will consider moral agency as being a product of shared, community narratives.8 Dialogue It has been indicated all along that the biblical narrative of creation can play an important role in the ecological reformation of the Judeo-</page><page sequence="9">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 121 Christian tradition. However, the creation narrative must first be brought into dialogue with the ecological crises and modern biology. In Barbour's categories for ways of relating science and religion, dialogue represents a diverse group of views that occupies a middle position between independence and integration (Barbour 1997: 90). Hence, while in many respects religion and science are independent, they do converge on certain boundary questions (Ibid.). In such cases religion and science can be brought into genuine dialogue. Further, according to this approach classical theological doctrines can be refor- mulated in the light of science (Ibid.: 93). Barbour comments: If there are some points of contact between particular doctrines and particular scientific theories (such as the doctrine of creation in rela- tion to evolution or astronomy), and if it is acknowledged that the doctrines are historically conditioned, there is in principle the possi- bility of significant doctrinal development and reformation (Ibid.). It has long been acknowledged that the doctrine of creation is his- torically conditioned. For example, following Hermann Gunkel's groundbreaking work at the beginning of the twentieth century, bib- lical scholars began to look at the historical context of the creation narrative. The conclusion drawn from these studies reveals that there are two creation narratives in Genesis, the first in Genesis l:l-2:4a and the second in 2:4b-24. These accounts are likely separated by several hundred years. The older account ("Yahwist, tenth-ninth cen- turies B.C."), describes God as creating by "forming man out of clay and woman from the rib of man." In the later account ("Priestly Code, sixth-fifth centuries B.C."), God creates by speaking things into existence (Westermann 1984: 94). Hence, there is a long, dynamic biblical tradition in which Israel reflected on the creator-creation relationship in different ways at different times.9 Since it is clear that the creation narrative is historically condi- tioned, then it can be brought into dialogue with the new realities of modern biology and environmental degradation. The next part of this paper will argue for the importance of such a dialogue and the context for it within narrative ethics.</page><page sequence="10">122 DANE SCOTT The Importance of the Creation Narrative for a Judeo-Christian Environmental Ethic One important but neglected resource for discussing moral agency in terms of community narratives is Josiah Royce. For Royce, the problem of community is the problem of how unity can arise from a collection of individuals. This is a crucial point, for an environ- mental ethic to be effective it must to a large degree be a commu- nity ethic. In order to solve environmental problems, from suburban sprawl to endangered species to global warming, some shared val- ues that promote cooperation and coordination of actions are required. Thus, to realize the basic idea of the ecological community, people must be loyal to that cause and conceive of it in relatively similar ways. In Royce's terms, they must share the same will. But how can this happen? How do individual consciousnesses come to share the same will? Royce starts his explanation with an analogy. He sees the prob- lem of the unity of a community as analogous to the problem of bringing individual moments of consciousness into the unity of a per- son. So, how can the unity of the self arise from fragmentary moments of experience? The key is to see the self as a time-process. Taken in isolation, any fragmentary moment of a consciousness is not a self.10 The self consists in bringing together a remembered past and an expected future in the present moment.11 The self is "more or less a coherent plan expressed in a life" (Royce 1971: 362). 12 Turning to a more contemporary source, Alisdair Maclntyre makes a related point in After Virtue , when he discusses how we can come to understand a segment of human behavior. We cannot grasp a particular agent's behavior without knowing the history in which that behavior is situated. To illustrate this point Maclntyre discusses a man working in his yard. Interpretations of what he is doing can vary while being equally good. He is: "Gardening," "Taking exer- cise," "Preparing for winter" or "Pleasing his wife" (Maclntyre 1984: 206). These responses aim at understanding the agent's intentions, but we cannot know what those are apart from the agent's history. Maclntyre draws the following point: "We cannot . . . characterize behavior independent of intentions, and we cannot characterize inten- tions independently of settings which make those intentions intelli- gible both to agents and to others" (Ibid.). So unless one has an</page><page sequence="11">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 123 intelligible history for characterizing one's present actions, one can- not really know who one is or what one is doing. Royce builds upon his explanation of the unity of the self as he turns to the unity of communities as an analogous time-process: But a true community is essentially the product of a time-process. A community will have a past and will have a future. Its more or less conscious history, real or ideal, is part of its essence. A community requires for its existence a history and is greatly aided in its con- sciousness by a memory (Royce 1971: 361). To facilitate his solution to the problem of community Royce employs the terms community of memory and the community of hope. He defines a community of memory as a "community constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts as part of his own individual life and self the same past events" (Ibid.: 366). Royce defines the community of hope, or community of expectation, in a similar fashion, as when each member of a community accepts as part of "his own individ- ual life and self, the same expected future events" (Ibid.: 367). Since this paper deals with the creation narrative, I will focus primarily on its importance of its role in the Judeo-Christian community of memory. A more complete paper would need to discuss the com- munity of hope. As just stated, the community of memory brings together the psy- chological unity of many individual selves. Moreover, Royce com- ments, "the wealthier the memory of a community is, and the vaster the historical process which it regards as belonging to its life, the richer - other things being equal - is its consciousness that it ¿y a community" (Ibid.: 361). So, one half of the answer to the question of how a community can share mental life is that the members share a narrative history. To illustrate this point Royce uses the Maori of New Zealand. The individual members of the tribe are united by a common originating event: the arrival of the first Maori on the island of New Zealand. Each Maori can state: "I came over in the canoe Tai-Nui" (Ibid.: 364). In an important sense all Maori were present on the crossing.13 The nurturing of this collective memory is the crucial factor in bringing unity of the tribe out of the plurality of individuals. The biblical narrative of creation is an important element in the formation of a community of memory for Jews and Christians. The</page><page sequence="12">124 DANE SCOTT retelling of an originating event through successive generations brings all individuals into unity with a universal human community, regard- less of place or time, tribe or nation. But this narrative concerns the fate of the whole cosmos, not just the fate of a universal human community. Unfortunately, the tradition has neglected the possibil- ity of a more inclusive interpretation of the creation narrative, one that could include the ecological community. The tradition has overly focused on the difference between humans and the rest of creation rather than the commonalities. For example, Bernhard Anderson remarks on the commonality between humans and the rest of cre- ation in the biblical narrative. He writes: Indeed, there are striking points of contact: the emergence of biolog- ical life in the waters; the appearance of life on the land with its spe- cial characteristics of mobility, breathing, sentience, and so forth. And further the appearance of human is a novelty, even though the human and the animal are interrelated (Anderson 1987: 195). Hence, the creation narrative is key to a Judeo-Christian environ- mental ethic, because it allows for a community of memory that includes the whole ecological community. Through this narrative the ethical identities of Jewish and Christian communities can be united with the ecological community in one originating event. That is, just as the Maori are united in the crossing in the canoe Tai-Nui, humans are united with the ecological community in the beginning. However, the creation narrative is dualistic. Humans have a distinct role within creation. Humans are members of the ecological community, but perhaps not, in Leopold's words, "plain members." So while the bib- lical account is dualistic, it is ambiguously dualistic. In wrestling with the culpability of Christianity in environmental destruction, Wendell Berry pursues an instructive line on this issue (Berry 1993: 93). He argues that Christian communities are guilty as charged, but not because of the Bible. Genesis does not provide an essentially dualistic picture in which humans are separate from the rest of creation. On the contrary, "as creatures of God, [humans are] members of a holy community of Creation" (Ibid.: 106). It is not hard to imagine that this idea can be brought into fruitful dia- logue with the scientifically inspired notion of the ecological com- munity. Hence, one goal of a Judeo-Christian environmental ethic is to refocus attention on, in Berry's words, the "holy community of Creation."</page><page sequence="13">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 125 However, this can only happen if the creation narrative is made relevant to the present realties. Again, it must be brought into dia- logue with the facts of environmental degradation and the discov- eries of modern biology. (This, of course, is presendy going on in many quarters.) The next portion of this paper will turn to exploring a general approach for this dialogue. It will be suggested that Maclntyre's notion of an epistemological crisis and its resolution provides a good model for understanding how this dialogue might proceed. Epistemological Crises Their Resolution and the Narrative of Creation Maclntyre illustrates the basic notion of an epistemological crisis with reference to ordinary agents. Consider a person who is joining a club whose members he or she interprets to be friends. However, after joining the club this person is insulted and mistreated by these "friends." The epistemological crisis results from a breakdown in the relationship between seems and is. Imagine that the person has no schema for understanding this kind of behavior other than it being hostile and unfriendly. For instance, he or she has no knowledge of practices such as hazing. The people in the club seemed to be friendly, based on earlier experiences, but when given the reality of their recent unfriendly behaviors, the old interpretation seems false. The mistreated person will no doubt search his or her mind for ways to reinterpret the initially "friendly" behaviors in light of their pre- sent unfriendly behaviors. This will lead to a new interpretation that will affect his or her attitude toward these people. In a similar fashion communities can undergo epistemological crises. To be part of a community or culture is to share traditions or narratives, as was seen in Royce's notions of communities of mem- ory and communities of expectation. These narratives provide sche- mata for interpreting one's actions and the actions of others. During an epistemological crisis, some new facts or events call this schema into question. On some crucial points the narrative is shown to be in error. When communities undergo these crises, the relationship between seems and is breaks down. It will be instructive to look at an earlier episode when the Chris- tian community's interpretation of the creation narrative broke down. This epistemological crisis was precipitated by the Copernican</page><page sequence="14">1 26 DANE SCOTT revolution. For example, before Copernicus, the Christian narrative was interpreted so as to provide precise physical locations of heaven and hell - the tradition knew where God and the blessed resided and where Satan and the damned persisted. Heaven was up, beyond the sphere of the moon in the highest reaches of the cosmos, and hell was down, in the lowest reaches of the Earth. And, of course, the Earth resided at the center of everything. So, in Galileo's battle with the Church hierarchy over the heliocentric theory, his friends in Church leadership warned him of four points he must avoid: "the existence of rational creatures on other planets, the location of hell, Christ's ascension, and the anthropocentric purpose of creation" (Shea 1986: 124). Challenging these points would lead to an epistemological crisis for the Church. The possible existence of people on other planets would contradict the teaching that all people were descended from Adam. In addition, "the belief that hell was a real place situated in the center of the earth was widely held among Christians well into the seventeenth century" (Ibid.: 125). The location of hell at the cen- ter of the earth was deduced from an Aristotelian earth-centered cos- mology, as the damned must be as far from heaven as possible.14 Also, placing the sun at the center of the universe it caused difficulty for picturing the ascension of Christ into heaven (Ibid.). Pictorially, Christ's ascension makes sense if heaven is up, but where was Christ going if the earth is not the center of the celestial spheres? Finally, and most importantly, evidence that the earth moves around the sun like other planets contradicted the belief that humans were the pur- pose and center of creation. In sum, many of Galileo's opponents could not see the Christian narrative as making sense if the earth moved. Their schemata for interpreting reality would, they thought, be irredeemably fractured. Ultimately, of course, Galileo's adversaries could not withstand his arguments. Predictably, the result was an epistemological crisis. Maclntyre comments: "One of the signs that a tradition is in crisis is that its accustomed ways for relating seems and is begin to break down" (Maclntyre 1977: 459). In the crisis caused by the Copernican theory, people were confronted with rival accounts for interpreting the motion of the planets and stars. Further, because the heliocen- tric view had such wide-ranging consequences for the rest of the tra- dition, people were frightened and confused. While epistemological crises are by definition unsettling, and often</page><page sequence="15">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 127 frightening, their resolution is an occasion for growth, for epistemo- logica! progress. Maclntyre writes: [EJpistemological progress consists in the construction and reconstruc- tion of more adequate narratives and forms of narratives and . . . epis- temologica! crises are occasions for such reconstruction (Ibid.: 456). Thus progress is measured in the ability to "reconstruct a more ade- quate narrative." Epistemologica! crises and their resolutions are an ordinary part of human existence. Humans are story- telling animals; this is the way we make sense out of chaos. The young child wants to know "Who am I? Where did I come from? How did the world come to be?" (Ibid.: 457). The response to the child is a story, and this story must be intelligible and adequate in terms of the child's limited experience. But the stories that were once intelligible and adequate soon meet with some crisis as the child learns more about the world. Epistemological progress occurs when he or she rewrites and reinterprets these narratives in ways that includes the new facts and observations, while makings sense of just why he or she was formerly mistaken. The epistemological crises caused by the Copernican revolution followed this pattern. For example, as a result of the new concep- tion of the universe, belief in the physical locations of heaven and hell was slowly abandoned. Also, it became much more difficult to think of God in anthropomorphic terms. However, growth stopped far short of what was possible. The crisis should have undermined both an anthropomorphic view of God and an anthropocentric view of creation. The reformation of the narrative was incomplete and opportunities were missed. This is a little surprising, as Galileo's crit- ics believed that the heliocentric view would undercut the belief that the cosmos was created for humans. For example, the archbishop Benedetto Castelli wrote to Galileo that the most important reason for objecting to his theory was that "since all things are created for man, it is clearly a necessary consequence that the earth cannot move like the stars" (Shea 1986: 126). For a variety of reasons, which cannot be discussed here, the Judeo-Christian narrative of creation remained anthropocentric. However at the time, the possibilities were there for a more fruitful reconstruction of the earth-human rela- tionship. Hence, it may be profitable to revisit the epistemological crises of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to see what opportu- nities were missed.</page><page sequence="16">1 28 DANE SCOTT In this last section a few comments will be made on the direc- tion such an investigation might take. My purpose is merely to sug- gest that there was a line of conversation in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that could have led to a more fruitful dialogue between science and the narrative of creation, thus avoiding the anthropocentrism that has characterized the Judeo-Christian tradi- tion during the modern era. Missed Opportunities: Humbly Dealing with Our Ambiguous Dualism One neglected thinker who confronted the emerging epistemological crisis of the late Renaissance-Early Modern period was Michel de Montaigne.15 Few contemporary philosophers take Montaigne seri- ously, with the exception of Stephen Toulmin. However, as Toulmin points-out, during Montaigne's lifetime and the generation that fol- lowed, he was taken very seriously as a philosopher. For example, both René Descartes and Blaise Pascal were in direct dialogue with Montaigne in creating their philosophies (Toulmin 2001: 23). But Descartes quickly displaced Montaigne as the dominant voice in philosophical discourse. In doing so he changed the direction of the conversation away from Montaigne's skeptical humanism and toward his own quest for metaphysical certainty.16 Hence, Montaigne's ap- proach to the developing epistemological crisis in the Christian tra- dition was largely abandoned in favor of more dogmatic approaches. In a real sense, then, Montaigne represents the path not taken. Given the many environmentalists' critiques of the path we did take during the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, a reexamination of Montaigne may be instructive. Specifically, there are two interrelated points where Montaigne is helpful. The first is his understanding of the earth-human relationship, which he develops in dialogue with the creation narrative. The second is his skeptical attitude toward human motivations and intellectual pursuits. It is not being argued that Montaigne had the answers to our problems but that he was pushing the dialogue in a fruitful direction that was not taken. To begin, Montaigne was aware of Copernican theory. He writes that, "Copernicus has grounded [the] doctrine [that the earth moves] so well that he uses it very systematically for all astronomical deduc- tions" (Montaigne 1957: 429). However, he goes on to note that in a thousand years or so another theory will likely supplant Copernicus'</page><page sequence="17">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 129 (Ibid.). This line of thinking about the provisional character of human theories is indicative of Montaigne's approach to the epistemologi- ca! crisis of his day.17 One of the key words in Montaigne's writings is presumption , which he says: "is our natural and original malady" (Ibid.: 330). This is the reason for his skeptical attitude about human intellectual pur- suits. It is important to note that Montaigne lived through the wars of religion. This clearly played a role in his skepticism about human motives in establishing dogmatic truths. He writes: "See the horri- ble impudence with which we bandy divine reasons about, how irre- ligiously we have both rejected them and taken them again, according as fortune has changed our place in the public storms" (Ibid.: 323). Montaigne is not faulting Christianity for the viciousness of his day but the false motives of some of its most dogmatic champions; his skepticism is skepticism about finite, fallible human beings. This view of prideful, presumptuous human nature was informed by his inter- pretation of the biblical narratives of the creation and the fall. So Montaigne was in dialogue with the biblical narratives. Like many Christian thinkers, Montaigne saw the "great archi- tecture" of creation as reflection of the greatness of its Creator (Ibid.: 326). Sounding like John Muir, he writes: For this world is a very holy temple, into which man is introduced to contemplate, statues, not statues wrought by mortal hand, but those which the divine thought has made perceptible - the sun, the stars, the waters, and the earth (Ibid.: 326). It is important to note that we can contemplate the wonders of cre- ation but not intellectually grasp them. Montaigne did not champion the cosmological argument and natural theology. His defense of Sebond's book on natural theology is ironic. For Montaigne, our intellect is earth-bound; we are part of the cosmos, and a part cannot grasp the whole. The point here is that in developing his understanding the human position in nature, Montaigne was in dialogue with the nar- rative of creation. We can contemplate the wonders of creation, which point to a more wonderful Creator, but our intellect is not adequate to grasp them. Montaigne concludes from the biblical narrative that we humans are finite, fallible creatures who are a part of the earth. We are placed here to contemplate its wonders and that of its maker. Montaigne was unusual for his time in looking at the world in non-anthropocentric terms. For example, In Defense of Raymond Sebond</page><page sequence="18">1 30 DANE SCOTT includes an extended section in which he attempts to demonstrate our commonality with the other animals. His goal is to humble human arrogance that we are somehow superior based on the belief that we have rational souls and animals do not. In a move that anticipates many thinkers in the twentieth century, Montaigne "nat- uralizes" human intelligence by arguing that it shares the same basic nature as animal intelligence. Human reason does not elevate us above the rest of creation: that feat is performed by a deceitful trick of imagination and presumption. He writes that, "it is by vanity of [man's] imagination that he picks himself out and separates himself from the horde of other creatures" (Ibid.: 331). For Montaigne we are clearly animals, but that is not the whole story. According to Donald Frame, the thrust of Montaigne's phi- losophy is to learn to accept the human condition, which is dualis- tic. Frame comments: To accept the human condition is to accept our two parts, body and soul, not as slave and master but as relatively equal parts that should be friends. We are neither body nor a soul, but both.18 In an instructive section of his book, Cosmopolis , Stephen Toulmin compares the "dualism" of Montaigne with that of Descartes. Toulmin writes: In his final essay, Of Experience , Montaigne confronted head-on the chief philosophical problems that Descartes was to address fifty years later; and he drew reasons from his own experience to reject in advance the conclusion that Descartes argued for in general and abstract terms in the Meditations (Toulmin 1990: 37). Montaigne rejected the kind of mind/body dualism that became so influential after Descartes. Toulmin contrasts the earthiness, the sen- suality and even crudeness of Montaigne's essays with the disem- bodied austerity of Descartes writings. Toulmin summarizes the main difference he sees between the two men. He writes: For Montaigne, part of our humanity is to accept responsibility for our bodies, our feelings and the effects of the things we do, given these bodies and feelings; and we must do so, even if we cannot always keep these things under complete control (Ibid.: 40). Hence, Montaigne was thinking about our dualistic nature in a way quite different from the Cartesian dualism environmental philoso- phers have so criticized.</page><page sequence="19">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 131 By way of summary, the direction Montaigne was taking the con- versation before Descartes was to concentrate on our ambiguous dualism. This is clearly a possible interpretation of the creation nar- rative. Further, by concentrating on our earth-bound bodies and intellect, Montaigne approached the epistemological crises of his day with modesty and humility. However, it must be clear that I am not advocating Montaigne's pyrrhonianism as an approach to dialogue on the creation narra- tive. The pyrrhonian's willingness to endlessly argue both sides of every issue is no way to solve our ecological crises. Ultimately, Montaigne's commitment to pyrrhonianism led him into the dead end of conventionalism. But of Montaigne's two successors, Pascal, unlike Descartes, did take up Montaigne's line of conversation and move it in a fruitful direction. While critical of Montaigne, Pascal did confront our ambigu- ous dualism. He used many of Montaigne's arguments to oppose the excesses of the kind mind/body, human/earth dualism of Descartes - which environmental philosophers have so criticized. For example, Pascal writes in the Pensées: What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how monstrous, how chaotic, how paradoxical, how prodigous! Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, repository of truth, sink of doubt and error, glory and refuse of the universe! (Pascal 1966: 64) Clearly, Pascal sees humans as being unique because of our minds, but this is no warrant for superiority; we are earth-bound. In a long passage Pascal develops Montaigne's theme of warning us against the excesses of our infinite imagination and presumptu- ous nature. At the dawn of the scientific revolution, which has as much as anything enabled environmental destruction, Pascal coun- sels that we should first "contemplate the whole of nature in its full and lofty majesty" (Ibid.: 89). He thinks once we do this we will see that humans disappear in the face of the infinite expanse of the macro-cosmos, yet we are everything when compared to the infinite- simal micro-cosmos. He writes: "Because [we] have failed to con- template these infinities, men have rashly undertaken to probe into nature as if there were some proportion between themselves and [nature]" (Ibid.: 90). Further, once we are humbled by the marvels of the infinities of creation, he "believes that with [our] curiosity changing to wonder [we] will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than to investigate them with presumption" (Ibid.: 90).</page><page sequence="20">132 DANE SCOTT So like Montaigne, Pascal attempts to humble the human pride and arrogance based on a colossal over estimation of the power of our intellect. However, unlike Montaigne, Pascal does believe our intelligence separates us from nature, but, of course, not in the man- ner of Cartesian dualism. Pascal exhorts: "Let us realize our limita- tions. We our something but we are not everything. . . . Our intelligence occupies the same rank in the order of intellect as our body in the whole range of nature" (Ibid.: 92). Pascal affirms that our intellect, to some degree, separates us from the rest of creation, but is at the same time is earth-bound. We are, in his words: "Freaks!" Coming to grips with our freakishness, our ambiguous dualism, then, is where to start the proposed dialogue. Conclusion By way of summary, this paper has argued that the creation narra- tive is key to the formation of a community of memory in the Judeo- Christian tradition. Further, because this narrative places all the earth's creatures and systems in one common originating event, it can contribute to realizing the basic idea of an ecologie community. However, for this to happen, the narrative must be brought into dialogue with the fact that the Judeo-Christian tradition is culpable in the environmental crisis. It must also be in dialogue with dis- coveries in biology and ecology that conflict with the narrative. The sticking point for these dialogues is that the creation narrative gives humans a special place in creation. And while there is something clearly different about humans, the old anthropocentric interpreta- tion of the Genesis narrative is clearly wrong. However, pursuing some kind of metaphysical holism is filled with problems. So the question is: how does the Judeo-Christian tradition make sense of human "uniqueness" as given in the narrative of creation? This inquiry, then, suggested that the line of conversation taken up by Montaigne and continued by Pascal would make a good starting point: how are we to understand our ambiguous dualism?

Alisdair Maclntyre describes what it is like for an individual to be in an epis- temologica! crisis. He writes: "The agent who is plunged into an epistemological crisis knows something very important: that the schema of interpretation which he has trusted so far has broken down irremediably in certain highly specific ways." (Maclntyre 1977: 453-71). 2. For example, Clare Palmer points out some of the difficulties with a holistic environmental ethic that sees no distinct boundaries between the self and the world (Palmer 2002: 179-80). The ethical conclusion of ecological holism, according to Baird Callicott, is that "a nonanthropocentric environmental ethic, fully ecologized so to speak, turns out to be a form of enlightened self-interest - or better, embed- ded - collective human self interest after all" (Callicott 1994: 208). Palmer goes on to note the strange consequences of adopting this view. She writes: Suppose I were cycling along a road and a car knocked me over. You came rushing over to my assistance, helped me up, checked me over for broken bones. I began to thank you for your help, and you said "No, that's all right, you're part of me. I did it for myself." I would feel there is something miss- ing here, that if that was really what you thought, then I was merely an instru- ment for your own well being and that you had not responded to my need as another human being, someone different from and other to yourself (Palmer 2002: 179-80). Palmer goes on to note additional problems with this kind of ecological holism, such as that its concepts are so general as to offer little guidance in dealing with ethical conflicts, or help to discriminate between different elements in the environ- ment toward privileging one thing over another. In other words, it is often hard to see how ecological holism offers practical guidance in concrete situations. 3. It might be objected that the Creationists have kept their focus on the Genesis narratives. However, for these people the Creation narratives are purely instru- mental. They concentrate on them to defend the doctrine of Biblical literalism. Hence, the Creationists are not really using the Creation narratives as part of a community of memory. 4. However, this position is largely maintained by what C. S. Pierce called the method of tenacity. So while it seems strong at the moment, it is unlikely that it can be maintained in an open society indefinitely, as the method of tenacity for fixing beliefs relies on controlling the flow of information. For example, there are indications that "intelligent design" may be replacing Creationism. If true, this indi- cates that some dialogue is taking place. Intelligent design represents a movement away from many of the more dogmatic claims held by the Creationists, such as the young age of the earth. 5. Callicott summarizes the logic of this story: Natural selection has endowed human beings with an effective moral response to perceived bonds of kinship and community membership and identity; today the natural environment, the land, is represented as a community, the biotic community; and that, therefore, an envi- ronmental or land ethic is both possible - the biopsychological and cognitive con- ditions are in place - and necessary, since human beings collectively have acquired the power to destroy the integrity, diversity, and stability of the environment and supporting economy of nature (Callicott 1989: 83). 6. Callicott writes: "Therefore, the key to the emergence of a land ethic is, simply, universal ecological literacy (Callicott 1989: 82)." 7. One difficulty with Callicott's account deals with the ability of the moral sen- timents to be extended to non-persons. Ernest Partridge, while sympathetic to the project of developing a naturalistic environmental ethic, nonetheless argues that this</page><page sequence="22">1 34 DANE SCOTT project cannot be warranted by a theory of moral sentiments. Briefly, he identifies the essential reason as being that, "moral sentiments seem to require persons (Partridge, 2002: 24)." Hence, there is no reason to suppose that sympathies that originate in interpersonal relationships can be extended to the non-personal relation- ships, which would be required to realize the ethical ideal of an inclusive ecologi- cal community. 8. This account presupposes many arguments given in the twentieth century that provide explanations of moral agency in terms of narratives. Some of the thinkers that have provided arguments along these lines are Paul Ricouer, Hans- George Gadamer, Charles Taylor, Alasdair Maclntyre and, early in the century a neglected source, Josiah Royce. 9. Westermann comments: Creation is many sided. The process of Creation has not been and cannot be established definitively: each age can only express it in a way intelligible to itself. Consequently the Old Testament presents not one but many accounts (Ibid.). 10. Perhaps we have all experienced a moment when we have forgotten why we are doing something. At that instant the unity of the self is lost, and in a sense so is the self. In those brief instances there is an odd vertigo as the self evaporates in confusion. When these moments of confusion come upon us, we pause and recall our past and what has brought us to the present moment and where we are going. We find ourselves by reference to our remembered past and imagined future. This is likely what people mean when they refer to an Alzheimer sufferer as being "gone," that the person they once knew is no longer there. The former self of an Alzheimer's patient has disappeared because the ability to integrate past and future selves in the present moment is no longer there. 1 1 . Royce comments: The individual self is no mere present datum, or collec- tion of data, but is based upon an interpretation of the sense, of the tendency, of the coherence, and of the value of a life to which belongs the memory of its own past. ... In brief, my idea of myself is an interpretation of my past - linked also with an interpretation of my future (Royce 1971: 362)." 12. "My individual self extends backwards, and is identified with my remem- bered self of yesterday, or of former years. This is an interpretation of my life which in general turns upon the coherence of deeds, plans, interests, hopes, and spiritual possessions in terms of which I define myself (Royce 1971: 365)." 13. Similarly, Royce comments about the historical process of the formation of the Christian community: "This process, as conceived by Paul and his churches, had gone from Adam to Moses, from Moses to Christ; and the very life of the community was bound up with its philosophy of history. That the memory of this community was in part legendary is beside the point. Its memory was essential to its life, and was busy with the fate of all mankind and with the course of time (Royce 1971: 361)." 14. One of Galileo's opponents, Cardinal Bellarmine reasoned, "No place is fur- ther removed from heaven than the center of the earth." Shea quotes Robert Bellarmine, Controversia Generalis de Christo 5:10, p. 125. 15. Copernicus completed De Revolutionibus three years before Montaigne's birth in 1533. 16. Toulmin remarks: "In the 1580's and 90's, skeptical acceptance of ambigu- ity and a readiness to live with uncertainty were still viable intellectual policies: by 1640, this was no longer the case. Intellectual opinions opened up by Erasmus and Rabelais, Montaigne and Bacon, were set aside, and for a remarkably long time these options were taken seriously only by consciously "heterodox" thinkers (Toulmin 1992: 44)." Toulmin goes on to contrast the "practical modesty and intellectual freedom of Renaissance humanism" with the "theoretical ambitions and intellectual constraints of seventeenth-century rationalism (Ibid.: 42)."</page><page sequence="23">THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AND THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION 135 17. Clearly the epistemologica] crisis of Montaigne's day was the result of many complex factors. It had much to do with the effects of the Reformation, the dis- covery of the New World, as well as the collapse of Aristotleanism precipitated by Copernicus, and later Galileo, and so forth. 18.
