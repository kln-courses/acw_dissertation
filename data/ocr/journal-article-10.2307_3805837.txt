Hume, Pennsylvania State University $60.00 hardcover The lens of history The Secret History of Domesticity Public, Private, and the Division of Knowledge Michael McKeon "This is a deliciously rich and generous exploration ofthe material and conceptual separation of the public from the private, one that illuminates just about every aspect of what it means to be modern: political, sexual, literary, artistic. The erudition is staggering; the play of history and representation is subtle and elegant; the openings to philosophy, to the sociology of knowledge, and to political theory are imaginative and often unex- pected." ?Thomas W. Laqueur, University of California?Berkeley $60.00 hardcover The Edge of Modernism American Poetry and the Traumatic Past Walter Kalaidjian "There is nothing quite like this book. A clearly written and broadly researched, sophisticated study extending the scope of today's trauma studies iSJI into the analysis and appreciation of American poetry.

Leitch, University of Oklahoma $50.00 hardcover Painting Women Cosmetics, Canvases, and Early Modern Culture Patricia Phillippy "Phillippy's focus on the semantic slippage of 'painting' as verb, adjective, and noun yields a bril- liantly substantive way of thinking about the individual discourses of painting, cosmetics, and poetry as they arise from a common historical background." ?Marshall Grossman, University of Maryland $52.00 hardcover Parallax: Re-visions of Culture and Society Stephen G.
