<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phenomenology Begins at Home: The Presence of Things in the Short Fiction of Katherine Mansfield and Virginia Woolf Aimee Gasston In Virginia Woolfs story 'The Evening Party', unpublished during her lifetime, the conversation of the partygoers settles momentarily to explore the sensory pleasures so often forgotten by literature: Ah, we're an ungrateful race! When I look at my hand upon the window sill and I think what pleasure I've had in it, how it's touched silk and pottery and hot walls [...] Never for a second since I was born ceased to tell me of hot and cold, damp or dryness, I'm amazed that I should use this wonderful composition of flesh and nerve to write the abuse of life. Yet that's what we do. Come to think of it, literature is the record of our discontent.1 The short fiction of both Woolf and Katherine Mansfield ran in vigorous opposition to such a record of discontent, although the subject-object relation they depicted was often complicated. The hand as described by the partygoer is a convincing model for the material focus of much of their experimental short fiction; sitting at the border between subject and object, the hand undergoes sensory experience before transcribing that experience from a liminal hinterland.2 In Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea (1938), a work perceptibly influenced by modernist literature as well as 31</page><page sequence="2">Journal of New Zealand literature contemporaneous thinkers such as Heidegger, the protagonist Roquentin's first experience of nascent existential nausea or angst occurs in his hand: 'I felt in my hand a cold object which attracted my attention by means of a sort of personality. I opened my hand and looked: I was simply holding the doorknob'.3 Shortly after this scene, a pebble asserts itself against Roquentin's hand (despite his outrage that 'objects ought not to touch since they are not alive^, which he describes as a 'sweet disgust' passing from the pebble to his hands; 'a sort of nausea of the hands'.4 The short fictions of Mansfield and Woolf prefigure these moments of crisis and are similarly concerned with relaying those encounters brought about by the experience of an 'everyday existence haunted by matter'.5 By revising and unsettling categories of subject and object, their short fiction suggests a democratised worldview and works to undo the unchallenged hegemony of the subject. As innovators of stream-of-consciousness narration, Mansfield and Woolf are still primarily considered articulators of subjective interiori ty, but the ways in which this is enabled by an engagement with the external world and ordinary objects is only beginning to be fully recognised. As commentators such as Jessica Feldman have observed, this material fascination was not isolated: 'modernist writers brought dead objects back to life: railroad timetables, cracked teacups, golden bowls, heather- mixture stockings, Connemara cloth, vaseline and orangeflowers.'6 Yet the emphasis is far more sharply drawn in the short fiction of Mansfield and Woolf, where objects loom large in the truncated story form and 'material objects seem a condition of narratability', often projecting an unsettling presence or agency which articulates the uneasy subject/object relationship.7 Lorna Sage even went as far as describing Mansfield's stories as 'intensely crafted and evocative objects-on- the-page'.8 Both Mansfield and Woolf displayed a material sensibility that was unusually highly attuned. In her notebooks, Mansfield 32</page><page sequence="3">Phenomenology Begins at Home attempts to explain a sense of epiphany by noting that ťthis sensitiveness [. . .] has never anything to do with present people but is nearly always connected with "things'".9 Elsewhere, she writes that she would 'be quite content to live here, in a furnished room, and watch', implying a preference for the object world over that of the subject.10 In a letter of October 1918 to Roger Fry in response to praise of her story "The Mark on the Wall', Woolf would comment: Tm not sure that a perverted plastic sense doesn't somehow work itself out in words for me', highlighting the reiterative material bent of her literary output.11 In their short fiction, objects refuse to stay still and be quiet. In Mansfield's 'Prelude', Linda Burnell's wallpaper famously 'come[s] alive' beneath her fingertips; ť[t]hings had a habit of coming alive like that', it is explained, '[n]ot only large substantial things like furniture but curtains and the patterns of stuff and the fringes of quilts and cushions'.12 In Woolfs unpublished piece 'Nurse Lugton's Curtain', the pattern being stitched on the curtain stirs; as the nurse begins to snore, ťall the animals began to prance' and 'the blue stuff turned to blue air; the trees waved; you could hear the water of the lake breaking; and see the people moving over the bridge and waving their hands out of the window' (HH 154). And of course Miss Brill's fur necklet cries when put away in its box. In the concluding part of his book 'The Bases of Modern Science' (1928), Mansfield's sometime friend J. W. N. Sullivan asserts that 'science, by its very nature, can tell us nothing about phenomena but their structure'; it is this gap left by science which Mansfield's and Woolfs short fiction fills.13 As Woolf put it in her 1927 review of Mansfield's journal: 'writing, the mere expression of things adequately and sensitively, is not enough' - it must also be 'founded upon something unexpressed; and this something must be solid and entire' (Journal 257). Capturing the ineffable quality of the ineluctably material was something that could only be achieved by literary, not scientific, experiment. 33</page><page sequence="4">Journal of New Zealand Uterature If 'in the end, at its moment of ending, every narrative is stilled in a kind of objecthood', then perhaps the plastic proclivity of these authors' short fiction can be partially explained by the frequency of endings which somehow crystallise these fictions into decidedly phenomenal entities.14 They are also objects which ought not to touch since they are not alive, but do - again and again. This essay aims to explore these authors' depictions of an everyday (subjective) existence haunted by (object) matter - their exploration and narration of what Bill Brown calls ťan interaction at once physical and psychological, at once intimate and alienating' - and to probe their captivating and disturbing texts with cautious but grateful fingers.15 A Touch of Fairy? In November 1919, in a characteristically graceful yet pointed letter to her husband John Middleton Murry, Mansfield wrote: How I envy Virginia; no wonder she can write. There is always in her writing a calm freedom of expression as though she were at peace - her roof over her - her own possessions round her - and her man somewhere within call.16 Here, Mansfield equates the security afforded by personal possessions with that provided by shelter or a lover. Her jealousy appears to have sprung directly from perceived lack, with the statement following rich and lively description of all the 'lovely [yet unaffordable] things' for sale in the San Remo antique shops, as well as Mansfield's reflection on her marriage, which straddled international borders and failed to offer her all she had anticipated. A long way from the hemisphere of her birth, from her husband and from her friends (bar her dedicated yet 34</page><page sequence="5">Phenomenology Begins at Home unfathomably infuriating companion, Ida Baker), Mansfield clearly felt displacement keenly, yet she appears to have counterbalanced this to some extent through a rich and concentrated material engagement. The Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Society's diverse collection of personal ephemera attests to their significance to the author, as do her letters, in which these objects play cameo parts with frequency.17 These possessions were often sentimentalised, becoming like 'old and trusted friends in a nomadic existence',18 sometimes also signifying distant or departed loved ones.19 In her memoirs, Ida Baker recalls how 'wherever she was, Katherine made and kept her "home" as beautiful and as expressive as possible', explaining that 'however poor and sparse her possessions', Katherine's sense of 'order and form always imparted a feeling of space and beauty'.20 Elsewhere in the memoirs, Baker describes Mansfield's talent for making a 'room come alive' by rearranging its components, stating how 'things needed her presence', thus highlighting the interdependency between subject and object which would also permeate her fiction.21 Objects become animated in Mansfield's presence with a startling frequency; in her journal she ponders whether chinaware sat upon a writing table 'may or may not have shaken itself awake for just one hundredth of a second out of hundreds of years of sleep' (Journal 79).22 Elsewhere, she records at Portland Villas, Hampstead: 'My room really has for me a touch of fairy. Is there anything better than my room? Anything outside?' (Journal 97). Kitty, protagonist of the unfinished piece 'Confidences', similarly exclaims with delight at her friend's home which always gives one "the feeling it's so alive" ( Fiction 2, 480), as if the domestic arena itself were imbued with transformative powers. Woolf also displayed a keen sensitivity to domestic objects and their harmony of arrangement; on viewing a Bloomsbury flat she expresses her distaste on being 'shown into a beautiful room' which was 'disfigured horribly with velvet curtains, gigantic purple cushions, &amp; the usual swarm of gilt &amp; lemon coloured 35</page><page sequence="6">Journal of New Zealand Literature objects' (Diaņ 1, 15) and finds Ottoline MorrelTs Garsington Manor claustrophobic with ťtoo many nick nacks for real beauty, too many scents, &amp; silks' (. Diary 1, 78). When Woolf and her sister, Vanessa Bell, move from their parental home at Hyde Park Gate, she wrote of the way in which familial artefacts were rejuvenated by the bright spaces of Gordon Square: 'Things one had never seen in the darkness there [at Hyde Park Gate] - Watts pictures, Dutch cabinets, blue china - shone for the first time in the drawing room at Gordon Square.'23 In 1918, she writes to Vanessa of the 'exquisite pleasure' her painting has given her on hanging it at home ('so cool, so harmonious, so exquisitely tinted') which leads her 'to conceive the room as a whole, in relation to [Bell's] picture' and commence a frantic hunt for a suitable covering for the yellow chair which disrupts the concord of the scene (Letters VW 2, 259). And, in 1919, Woolf records her delight at being given a green glass jar by the chemist, long coveted because 'glass is the best of all decorations, holding the light and changing it' (Diary 1, 170). Although in Woolfs autobiographical writings the animism of objects is arguably less pronounced than in Mansfield's (or the short fiction of either), there is the similar sense of the importance of the non-subject world, of its capacity to resonate and reverberate, to influence the subject rather than be dominated by it. As Jean Baudrillard has observed, 'human beings and objects are indeed bound together in a collusion in which the objects take on a certain density, an emotional value - what might be a presence'.24 He locates this density in the 'complex structure of interiori ty' brought about by the domestic, where objects serve as 'boundary markers of the symbolic configuration known as home' with anthropomorphism curiously rendering them 'household gods'.25 If these objects signify the boundary of the confluence between the subject and object worlds, they do not do so with a sense of authoritative distinction. Instead, they function as markers of liminality, rather like the short fictions of 36</page><page sequence="7">Phenomenology Begins at Home Mansfield and Woolf which ruminate on the stilling of the subject by death, and the vivification of the insensate. The domestic environment then not only bestows objects with an unusually affective potency; it also enables and lubricates the slippage between the realms of human and material that these stories exploit. Gaston Bachelard states that 'when we dream of the house we were born in, in the utmost depths of reverie, we participate in this original warmth, in this well-tempered matter of the material paradise'.26 Elsewhere in The Poetics of Space , he observes that the inescapable resonance of the home in which each of us grew up lies largely in its function as 'a resting place for daydreaming' and further, that 'often the resting place particularise [s] the daydream'.27 As an adult, Woolf herself returned to her childhood home at Hyde Park Gate 'repeatedly in her thoughts and in her writing'.28 Mansfield too reimagined her childhood homes in her journal and recreated 75 Tinakori Road in stories like 'The Garden Party' and her Karori residence, Chesney Wold, in 'Prelude'.29 Our original shell or shelter and its furnishings, Bachelard argues, not only provide comfort and space to grow but are responsible for shielding individuals as they learn to flex their imaginative faculties by dreaming, and plays an important role in shaping those dreams. In other words, the material structure of the home and its contents not only nurtures artists but also informs their eventual modes of production. The recurring depiction of the domestic in the short fiction of both Mansfield and Woolf attests to Bachelard's thesis, much of which was written at a time when the domestic interior was being 'reconceived by the antibourgeois energies of Bloomsbury', when 'the domestic interior [became] the explicit imaginative space'.30 37</page><page sequence="8">Journal of New Zealand Uterature War, Death, Fragments If the domestic interior provided a richly complex setting for the contemplation of a renegotiated subject-object relationship, so did the external context of war. Nicholas Saunders has observed that the Great War 'breached the boundary between materiality and spirituality, and between emotion and object, more than any previous conflict'.31 Often the collision between human and object was gruesomely literal, as in the case of Mansfield's brother Leslie, killed by a grenade he was using in a demonstration to fellow officers. Woolf also notes how the unsettling ergonomics of warfare meant that its residue detritus might as easily be comprised of subject as object, recording in a diary entry of June 1918: L. was told the other day that the raids are carried out by women. Women's bodies were found in the wrecked aeroplanes. They are smaller and lighter and thus leave more room for bombs. Perhaps its sentimental, but the thought seems to me to add a particular touch of horror. ( Diary 1, 153) After battle, Saunders states, the earth was strewn with the 'fragments of war', with everything 'broken and in pieces, the differences between war matériel and human beings elided perhaps for the first time in human history'.32 While objects may have surged to fecund life in the domestic safety zone, there were plenty less fortunate who would expire on the battlefield, in disparate parts. If industrial warfare precipitated a terrifying new phase in the relationship between human and object, it also provoked a need for recuperation. Alongside conflict, material supplies also dwindled, and in her diary Woolf variously describes purchasing 'small fragments' of food and other necessaries in London.33 A humble reverence for the counterbalancing and weighty stoicism 38</page><page sequence="9">Phenomenology Begins at Home of objects runs throughout the short fiction of these authors; for example, Mansfield's 'dark furniture' which 'swelled with rich important life' ( Fiction 2, 104), or the protagonist of Woolf s 'The Mark on the Wall' who speaks of waking from a nightmare to lie 'quiescent, worshipping the chest of drawers, worshipping solidity' (HH 82). This veneration seems to be not only an expression of endorsement of the dignified, pacifist existence of the object world - what Douglas Mao describes as 'the profounder innocence of an immunity to thinking and knowing, the noble repose that comes of being out of reach of the human power to destroy' - but also a desire for things to be pulled back together, to fashion something in creation solid and significant from the scattered scraps.34 In 'The Russian Background' (1919), an essay in which Woolf crucially posits that 'inconclusive stories are legitimate', she asserts that their relevance lies in the way that 'somehow or other they provide a resting point for the mind - a solid object casting its shade of reflection and speculation'.35 Woolf goes on to elucidate that the 'fragments of which [the story] is composed may have an air of having come together by chance', literally casting the modern short story as an intriguing density of matter, composed of seemingly haphazard fragments.36 As a solidified deposit of consciousness, capable of stimulating thoughtful engagement, the short story might be usefully thought of as a paradigm of synthesis between subject and object, operating within the 'positively charged nexus of personhood and thinghood, subjectivity and objectivity', not so very different from the solid objects that populate its pages.37 Yet if it was a wider context of destruction and conflict that helped to precipitate this elision between subject and object, their inexorable polarisation was also reinforced by the creeping shadow of mortality, a presence that persists throughout the short fiction of Mansfield and Woolf, in which 'silence, darkness, death, pull against social conventions'.38 For example, in Woolf s 39</page><page sequence="10">journal of New Zealand Uterature story 'Sympathy', likely written in spring 1919, objects seem only to underline the frailty of the transient human subject: There is the yellow arm chair in which he sat, shabby but still solid enough, surviving us all; and the mantelpiece strewn with glass and silver, but he is ephemeral as the dusty light which stripes the wall and carpet. So will the sunshine on glass and silver the day I die. (HH 105) Michelle Levy notes how 'as the narrator of "Sympathy" thinks about the dead man's armchair, the endurance of the world of objects offers consolation'.39 If the world of external objects proffers comfort, it equally provokes unease - the stability it represents is one that precludes the compassion referenced by the story's tide, and its stubborn endurance is one that only emphasises the vulnerability of the mortal subject. In Mansfield's fiction, objects are also often considered in tandem with death; from 1922, Mansfield would be involved in the drafting of her will and thoughts of it would doubtless have prefigured the event. In 1921, she writes an imaginary letter in her journal in which two lovers repeatedly exchange a candlestick. It makes comical but (with hindsight) stark reading: ťIf it is on my side, I shall leave it to you in my will, all proper, and I think it would be nice of you, Camilla, to desire that it should be buried with you' (Journal 189). Two years earlier, Mansfield wrote a sketch of someone in a bath who muses, in a sweeping reversal of the usual modes of technological production (and traditional subject-object hierarchy), that it is 'terribly true that people were made to fit coffins - made in the shapes of coffins', with ťher wet shining toes' tragically appearing 'so gay, so unconscious of their fate' (Fiction 2, 210). Similarly, 'The Dove's Nest' (1920) delivers a glass dish that always brings a ' 'frisson ' to Marie because 'it reminded her always, as it lay solitary on the vast expanse [of the table], of a little tomb' {Fiction 2, 453). And in the story 'The Escape' (1920), the contents of a handbag are envisioned as those of a sarcophagus: 40</page><page sequence="11">Phenomenology Begins at Home The little bag, with its shiny, silvery jaws open, lay on her lap. He could see her powder-puff, her rouge stick, a bundle of letters, a phial of tiny pills like seeds, a broken cigarette, a mirror, white ivory tablets with lists on them that had been heavily scored through. He thought: 'In Egypt, she would be buried with those things.' ( Fiction 2, 218) Here, the jaws of the bag hint snickeringly towards its own vivacious afterlife, the seeds in its mouth gesturing at a type of inanimate persistence of production that might propel it into the future beyond its owner's decease. As subjects dwindle, objects come to vigorous life. Illness, Aloneness, Seeing and Being Yet it is not only death which catalyses this animation - literal or mental aloneness and remoteness also enable it. For instance, the female protagonist of Mansfield's Tsychology' needs time to detach herself from time spent alone with her vivacious possessions; before a visitor's arrival, they 'must be swept away, shooed away - like children, sent up the shadowy stairs, packed into bed, and commanded to go to sleep - at once - without a murmur!' ( Fiction 2, 194). Similarly, in Woolf s 'The Lady in the Looking-Glass', 'rugs, the chairs, the cabinets' rouse themselves to live 'their nocturnal life' before the eyes of a lone observer (HH 216). In another of Mansfield's stories, we witness a curtain 'folded, drooped, only to begin puff puffing out once more, filling, swelling, stretching out stiff with only a quiver, dancing a secret dance as it were while those birds of silence chased over the ceiling' (. Fiction 2, 173), as if animated by cathexis. In her essay 'On Being 111', Woolf laments the inability of language to capture the changed perceptual abilities brought 41</page><page sequence="12">Journal of New Zealand Uterature about by the 'great experience' of illness, which causes the world to 'change [. . .] its shape' so that ťthe whole landscape of life lies remote and fair, like the shore seen from a ship far out at sea' - yet this is precisely the world both her and Mansfield's short fiction appositely describes {Essays 4, 319). Critics such as Mary Burgan have noted: Tor Katherine Mansfield, as for Virginia Woolf, the creativity of women was inflected by illness. As madness haunts the writing of Virginia Woolf, physical disease haunts Mansfield's fiction'.40 The inflection of illness is also felt in these domestic scenes depicted as read by an alien, where the homely becomes unheimlich ; the everyday viewed from an oblique angle, seen anew, as from the sick bed, the liminal position of the outsider or with the keenness of scrutiny (and cognitive dissonance) that is also invoked by solitude. The uncanny is not, as it is often interpreted, a strictly supernatural or spectral mechanism. As Freud elucidates in his 1919 essay ťThe Uncanny': 'The German word " unheimlich yn is obviously the opposite of "Heimlich" [homely], " heimisch " ['native'] - the opposite of what is familiar'.41 And yet, the uncanny is ťthat class of the frightening which leads us back to what is known of old and long familiar'.42 In his essay, Freud refers to a study on the uncanny by E. Jentsch, describing how Jentsch identifies that 'one of the most successful devices' for the creation of uncanny effect in a story is 'to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an automaton'.43 As we have seen, in the short stories of Mansfield and Woolf, the mode employed is more likely to be the reverse, with objects twitching to life. The 'extravagant intensity of perception' (Letters VW 4, 231) that illness and aloneness brought to both Woolf and Mansfield seems key to the oblique viewpoint from which their short fiction was articulated; it is this distance that divorces the subject from embroilment in the everyday and initiates the unheimlich . In her journal, Mansfield repeatedly described her delight in solitude: 'it's enormously valuable and marvellous when I'm 42</page><page sequence="13">Phenomenology Begins at Home alone, the detail of life, the life of life' {Journal 30). In her essay 'Phases of Fiction', Woolf praises the novels of Henry James and Marcel Proust for freeing the reader 'to take delight [...] in things in themselves', because 'we see the strangeness of them only when habit has ceased to immerse us in them'.44 This is the same privilege enjoyed by the narrator of 'A Mark on the Wall', who embarks on a dizzying flight of phenomenological exploration in puzzling to classify the titular mark, leaping from Roman pottery to armchairs to book-binding tools to remark upon 'the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, so haphazard' and to amazedly exclaim: '[t]he wonder is that I've any clothes on my back, that I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment' (HH 78). Correspondingly, in Mansfield's 'Psychology', the object world robusdy endures while the couple in the story flounder, regarding themselves as 'two litde grinning puppets jigging away in nothingness' ( Fiction 2, 196). These instances resonate powerfully with Heidegger's description in Being and Time (1927) of what happens when angst transforms the 'tranquilised self-assurance' of 'Being-at-home', so that the self is no longer absorbed in the world and '[ejveryday familiarity collapses [...] Being-in enters into the existential "mode" of the "not-at-home."'45 'Nothing else', says Heidegger, 'is meant by our talk about "uncanniness"'.46 So many of these stories probe the idea of inauthentic versus authentic existence - the 'ordinary maddening chatter' ( Fiction 2, 197), or Being-at-home , versus the 'real self ( Fiction 2, 90), or Being- in, that Beryl contemplates in Mansfield's 'Prelude'. It is during fleetingly grasped moments of Being-in that Beryl can say to herself 'Life is rich and mysterious and good, and I am rich and mysterious and good, too' ( Fiction 2, 91). Linda Burnell also seems to approach, but not quite grasp, a similar state when lying on her bed, when everything has 'come alive down to the minutest, tiniest particle', yet she remains, with 'wide open watchful eyes, waiting for someone to come who just did not 43</page><page sequence="14">Journal of New Zealand literature come, watching for something to happen that just did not happen' ( 'Fiction 2, 69). One aim of the short fiction of both Mansfield and Woolf seems to be to make the reader feel at home in not feeling at home, by introducing the uncanny (and its accompanying state of attunement, angst) to habitual perception so that it is disrupted, so that things can be seen anew. Uncanniness instigates repossession of the self, what Heidegger termed Dasein ; it 'triggers those key moments in which Angst brings Dasein face to face with its terrible freedom to be or not to be, to dwell in inauthenticity or strive for self-possession'.47 Elsewhere in Being and Time , Heidegger defines Dasein as ťbeing-toward-death', and death haunts all these stories.48 In The Garden Party', Mansfield sought to enclose the 'diversity of life [...] Death included' ( Letters KM 5, 101) and there is perhaps something which inheres in the structure of the short story form that also induces a similar mode of perception in its reader. Tessa Hadley asserts that 'because a story is short, you can always feel the end coming, sooner rather than later', which 'makes for a more self-conscious immersion' and an awareness of 'the edges of the fiction, and of how it's made.'49 The unblinkered self-awareness enabled by short fiction - where one never quite escapes material existence and is refused the luxury of getting comfortable - shares deep affinities with Heidegger's concept of Dasein and the ontological explorations the fiction of Woolf and Mansfield would both enact and encourage.50 For when the 'armchair grounds itself at the end of a story 'with a gende shock', it is likely that 'the solid room which is suddenly presented with all its furniture expectant' will 'appear too large and gaunt to be submerged again'.51 It is as if these stories function as primers for the most fundamental questions of being. These short texts seem eager to produce a new type of reader; armchair phenomenologists who might look anew at the world around them. At the root of phenomenology is an interrogative approach to the wider world, as Heidegger put it: 'a knowing 44</page><page sequence="15">Phenomenology Begins at Home search for beings in their thatness and their whatness'.52 This questioning mode of engagement was key to the modernist short fiction innovated by both Mansfield and Woolf. As Mansfield set out in a letter of 1919 to Woolf, responding to a letter of Chekhov's recently published in the Athenaeum-. what the writer does is not so much to solve the question but to put the question. There must be the question put. That seems to me a very nice dividing line between the true &amp; the false writer - Come &amp; talk it over with me. (Letters KM 2, 320) An awareness of the necessity of endlessly resonating questions as a route to authentic being (as individual and/or artist), as well as to effective engagement with the materiality of the external world, underpinned the literature of both Mansfield and Woolf. If they could not have this conversation in person, their texts would have it for them, with the exchange continued by legions of readers, incited by the question put. Evocative yet recalcitrant objects, their stories will persist, raising generative questions for us to meet but not necessarily solve.

The 12 March 1916 entry of her journal is an example of her recollections, beginning: ťOur house in Tinakori Road stood far back from the road. It was a big, white-painted square house with a slender pillared verandah and balcony running all the way round it' (Journal 56). 30 Julia Prewitt Brown, The Bourgeois Interior (Charlottesville, London: University of Virginia Press, 2008), p. 103. Prewitt Brown here refers explicitly to the work of the Omega Workshop (active between 1913 and 1919). While the material influence of the Omega on Woolf can be explicidy discerned, the same is not true of Mansfield, whose uneasy relationship with (and often, geographical 48</page><page sequence="19">Phenomenology Begins at Home separation from) Bloomsbury has been well documented. Yet Mansfield demonstrated similar 'anti-bourgeois energies', whatever their provenance, as demonstrated by the following recollection by William Orton of her skills as interior decorator: 'She had made the place look quite beautiful - a couple of candles stuck in a skull, another between the high windows, a lamp on the floor shining through yellow chrysanthemums, and herself accurately in the centre, in a patterned pink kimono and white flowered frock, the one cluster of primary brightness in the room'. William Orton, The Last Romantic (London, 1937), p. 270, quoted in Meyers, Katherine Mansfield: A Darker View , p. 57. 31 Nicholas Saunders, 'Material Culture and Conflict: The Great War, 1914-2003', Matters of Conflict : Material Culture , Memory and the First World War ; ed. by Nicholas Saunders (London, New York: Routledge, 2004), p. 7. 32 Saunders, pp. 8-9. 33 For example: 'Having finished a chapter, I went off buying small fragments of things...' {Diary 1, 24). The protagonist of 'Solid Objects' similarly quests about London in search of pieces of china and glass, although their primary utility is aesthetic. Another diary entry reads: 'I pottered about buying small fragments of meat and vegetables, &amp; got some books out of the Library' (. Diary 1, 17). The next sentence reads 'I think we shall find it more useful than the London Library, as no one, save ourselves, reads solid books', juxtaposing a crafted literary solidity with a dwindling material fragmentation. 34 Douglas Mao, Solid Objects (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 9. This idea of recuperation of course resonates with Mansfield's view of her corpus ('How unbearable it would be to die, leave "scraps", "bits", nothing real finished', Notebooks 2, 125) and other modernist literary usage of the fragment (e.g. T. S. Eliot's in The Wasteland': 'These fragments I have shored against my ruins'). 49</page><page sequence="20">Journal of New Zealand Literature 35 Virginia Woolf, The Essays of Virginia Woolf ed. by Andrew McNeillie, 6 vols (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1991) 3, p. 84.
