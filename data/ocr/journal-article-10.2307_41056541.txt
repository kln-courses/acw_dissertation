Of the one hundred people inside, the stranded delegates from a conference on the representation of indigenous peoples organ- ised by academics and activists, it is only possible to save fifty. There happens to be just that number of South African San or 'Bushmen' guests trapped in the flames. Despite the commitment to a universal principle rejecting any appeal to race as arbitrary, is it not reasonable to save them before other guests because of the obligation to preserve threatened cultures? Doesn't a sense of the injustices of history, and an appreciation of the vulnerability of marginalised cultures, demand the preservation of the most threatened? David Theo Goldberg1 uses this parable to demonstrate the relevance of non-biological or culturalist racial distinctions. The assumption is that if the cul- ture, defined in terms of language and practices, vanishes then the people or race are extinct too, and visa versa. In this non-biological interpretation race stands for historically specific forms of cultural connectedness and solidarity. Hereditary here involves cultural practices and self-identification. If race, as Anthony Appiah argues,2 biologizes what is culture or ideology, then Goldberg responds that it is also evident that the biological conception of race as heritability cannot be simply opposed to a cultural approach. Biology is itself a product of culture, and so privi- leging race as descent inflates a nineteenth-century reading of the significance of race into a transhistorical category. Taking issue with Goldberg's argument, Walter Benn Michaels claims that although we no longer identify race with the biological or conflate race and culture, culture is tied to a biological anchor.3 Discrimination, even the virtuous 1.

He points out that the analogy between cultures and persons leads to a misunderstanding about the nature of culture. If culture is simply what people do rather than who they are then it doesn't matter if the San all move to the suburbs and start hanging out in malls. San culture will have died even though there's been no loss of San. To identify culture with who a group is to slide into using culture as race, and the fact that we so readily think of culture in these terms means that it is continuing the racial thinking it is supposed to have supplanted. What is being preserved under the melancholic cover of vanishing cultures is nothing other than a fetishization of phenotype and descent; in short, the nostal- gia of race- an inheritance that will remember us if we do not remember it.4 Whatever the merits of this debate, it does illustrate the importance of the San to explorations of the relation between culture and race. But this is an exem- plarity that has a built in ambivalence for the exemplar is also the sample, one among a series of potential substitutes that best represents the common feature of that series. This standing in for others on the basis of resemblance is balanced by a sense of exemplarity as uniqueness, as paragon, as the best example, what can- not simply be exchanged for another, despite the seductive power of resemblance. These two senses are in tension with each other to the extent that being reduced (or elevated) to an exemplary example institutes an economy that is not necessarily fortuitous. Jeremy C. Hollmann's Customs and Beliefs of the /Xam draws on Dorothea Bleek's contributions to the journal Bantu Studies that appeared in nine parts be- tween 1931 and 1936, based on the material of the Bleek and Lloyd Collection in the Jagger Library at the University of Cape Town. This material is supplemented with the additional notes from the Jagger manuscripts that Dorothea omitted so as not to hinder the flow of the narrative. The original parallel text format with /Xam and its translation mirroring each other is retained while peculiarities of spelling have been restored and punctuation standardised. In addition to the folktales, with each section preceded by a useful introduction by Hollmann, there is a reprint of Dorothea's Bushman Grammar introduced by Tom Güldemann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology/Linguistics. The Bushman Grammar orig- inally appeared in English in two issues (1928/9 and 1929/30) of the Zeitschrift ßr Eingeborenen-Sprachen. Within Hollmann's overall conception of representation as a form of praxis this intralinguistic focus makes it possible to aspire to learn the grammar of the /Xam language: This book is intended as a contribution towards the reassertion of respect for and appreciation of Bushman cultures.'5 In making this material accessible, and in preserving the diacritical and typo-orthographic uniqueness of the original, Hollmann has performed a valu- able service. However my copy has no publication date and a binding problem where pages 201-216 are missing, seven sections according to the contents page. 4. According to Robert J.C. Young the categories of culture and race developed together, imbricated within each other. The sense of culture (from the Latin cultura and colere) as cultivate and inhabit - implicated in the Latin for farmer, colonus - informs the meaning of colony, and 'colonization rests at the heart of culture' (Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race [London: Routledge, 1995], 31). 5.

This said, the book is endorsed by Axel Thoma on behalf of the Working Group for Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) representing the San of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Those involved in the Oral Testimony Collection Project, conducted by the San for the San, thank Hollmann for making this unique collection available to the broader public and thereby also to the San; 'they have valued the stories of an extinct group of their fellow San and of their language.'6 The attempted withdrawal from autochtonic and homo- phyliac rootedness so distinctive of the struggle of democracy thrusts its roots into the security of autochthonous foundation and the stock or genius of filiation.7 Janette Deacon provides the 'Foreword' and unveils the following scene for the reader: Imagine being in goal in a city hundreds of kilometres from your family and the stark rural landscape of your home. You try hard to remember every rock and every bush that is familiar to you. You are afraid to speak your own language. Your fellow prisoners and warders do not understand your language and they call you stupid because you do not know what they say. One day, a strange man visits the prison and asks if you can teach him to speak as you do. He gets permission for you to live in the relative comfort of his home. Slowly you teach him and his sister-in-law how to use their tongues to make the click sounds in /Xam. You say the names of objects and objects to them over and over again until they get them right. They take a long time to write the words down, and then stumble over them again the next day. You wonder if they will ever learn. After a few months they can put a sentence or two together and they ask you to tell them stories. At first you tell them simple things. They find it hard to grasp why you laugh when you do, and you hang back when you realise they don't know enough to comprehend the depth of the story. The metaphors so obvious to you are lost on them . . .8 According to Deacon, '[t]hese could be the thoughts of IIKabbo, the grand- father whose knowledge and patience were the cornerstone of the /Xam language and memories that were recorded in Cape Town in the nineteenth century.'9 The fact that IIKabbo spoke Dutch10 is not allowed to interrupt the sketch: VXam has 6.

The value of the /Xam archive as witnessing and as testimony underlies the substitutive symmetry implied in a hermeneutic oriented on the presence of a shared primal meaning, mirroring the ideal encounter or communion of reader and author via the medium of text as intentional object. The effect of the narrative scene of commensurability elicits an identification, self-present and living, char- acterized as both essentially prior to writing and beyond the reach of colonialist ideologies: For both Wilhelm and Dorothea Bleek, and for Lucy Lloyd and the /Xam, this endeavour was a labour of love. None of them received monetary reward for learning the language of the other, nor for pub- lishing what had been recorded. While Lucy Lloyd and Wilhelm and Dorothea Bleek may have achieved academic recognition, their pur- pose was not to enrich themselves, but to record the knowledge for generations to come. Each contributed to the integrity of the whole.13 Hollmann's 'Introduction' also takes up the benign portrait of the scene of transcription and the politics of friendship: 'The /Xam were the teachers, and Wilhelm and his sister-in-law, Lucy Lloyd, the pupils and scribes.'14 What is ignored in the attempt to ground ethics in an ethos or ethnos of face-to-face encounter is evidence that Bleek was South Africa's first systematic theorist of racial difference; that he helped to inaugurate a tradition of compara- tive philology in South Africa in which historical narrative was linked into the competitive struggle between races; that he was involved in anthropométrie mea- surement and ethnological photography; and that the garden scene of reciprocal translation and transcription has been demystified.15 Despite the wish to redraw the colonial past nothing yet disproves Lubbock's remark in Prehistoric Times (first published in 1870) that 'Bleek regards them [Bushmen] as the lowest of human races'.16 11.

While he certainly imported aspects of European evolutionary thought into Africa, it is also true that a whole series of colonial models was bought back to the West, and the result was that the West could practice something like colonization, or an internal colonialism, on itself.17 The /Xam were of interest because of the light they could throw on the origins of community and the nation, of language, of religion, of literature, even of humanity and historical progress. Neo-humanism was an intimate part of Bleek's discourse and he resolutely and at every opportunity underlined his commitment to the essential unity and shared destination of mankind. Although I would caution against turning Bleek into a convenient scapegoat for racism and apartheid, it could be shown that it is from within this humanism that the philologist mines the resources incorporated into culturalist racism. Just as colonial power shaped the agency of the colonial intel- lectual and was imprinted on the margins of scholarly work, so it preoccupied the intellectual imagination with the question of origins.18 Writing of the historical genealogy of colonialism and imperialism in mid-nineteenth century European scholarship, Robert Young notes that this was the period in which Matthew Arnold's ethnographic politics- drawing on the work of Renan, Blumenbach, Niebuhr and Bunsen- were coded as Culture and Anarchy (1869) and answered obliquely by E.B. Tylor's Primitive Culture (1871) which argued for the essential unity of evolving humanity.19 Apart from the well- known connection with Arnold via his defence of Colenso,20 Bleek's work and his interest in the 'Bushmen' are not unrelated to these better known contemporaries. Christian K. Bunsen, famous diplomat and secretary to the historian Niebuhr, was a friend and sponsor of Bleek, introducing the young philologist to Colenso in London. In Researches into the Early History of Mankind, Tylor discusses Bleek's work on African fables, remarking the imperfections of 'Bushman' lan- guage while maintaining the universality of the mental processes of man. For Darwin and Engels the 'Bushmen' epitomise both the limitation and the power of the species. Subsequently Plekhanov refers to the 'Bushmen' for evidence of primitive communistic instincts, and in America Du Bois, drawing on Frobenius, remarks the superior development of the 'Hottentot' over the 'Bushman'. Most importantly, considering the interest in the aesthetic of the Bleek and Lloyd archive, the 'Bushmen' also figure in the birth of modernism. Roger Fry, organ- iser of the ground-breaking Post-Impressionist exhibition of 1910 featuring Matisse and Picasso, published an essay entitled 'The Art of the Bushmen'. Fry 17.

The first people have figured as a central mediator in nation building as much in 1994 as in the Jan van Riebeek Tricentenary of 1952. 22 One could add George Stow's The Native Races of South Africa (1905) and the incorporation of the 'Bushmen' within the desirability of South African national unity and reconciliation. Commemorative rhetoric can shade off into a version of the funeral oration or logos epitaphios ridiculed by Plato's Menexenus. In this rhetoric we all belong to the same com- munity, which is thereby legitimated via the mead of memory and renown, thanks to those who purchased the safety of the living by their deaths. The contingency of history is erased in an aura of 'belonging', and the sacrifices of the past were in some sense unavoidable for the creation of our present and future.23 Within the celebration of common humanity there is a work of mourning that swallows oth- ers, consigning them to the intimacy of affiliation and belonging. None of this sedimented representationality of the 'Bushmen' is allowed to derail the temptation of false recollection {paramnesia) and manufactured conti- nuity and unity. Homeopathic history not only modifies what happens afterwards, but everything that went before via a retroactive effect (Freud's nachträglich)1* specific to the structure of remembering. Why does historical scholarship fail to impinge on the supposed historicism of the 'Bushmen' industry? What of the place of metaphor and figuration in Bleek's own theory of the origin of lan- guage?25 Why the exclusion of any consideration or thematization of writing, the very technology of archivization, from the scene of inscription? The critical hiatus or repression forms a protective barrier- but protecting what? A more self- consciously literary approach usefully foregrounds the importance of imaginative investment. Neil Bennun's The Broken String. The Last Words of an Extinct People also opens with a narrative, asking us to imagine the setting of a cave painting in Lesotho: 'Walking upstream you will pass the mouth of the cave high above the opposite bank and a step half-acre of maize on your right; some twenty minutes later you will come to ...'26 The Odyssey of return to an archaic source 21.

Interpreting the 'Bushmen' as substitutive or surrogate victim has limited purchase given that the function of the pharmakos is to exteriorize the violence of the com- munity, to displace rather than dispossess (René Girard, Violence and the Sacred, trans.

Such an invocation presupposes a critical reflection on the importance of the 'Bushmen' (and Zulus) in Freud's articula- tion of the primitive. 25. It is possible to demonstrate conclusively that the centrality of anthropomorphism and personification in Bleek's account of the origin of language constitutes a tropological mechanism that organizes his ethnological distinctions. Race and cul- ture are for Bleek only thinkable within such terms. 26. Neil Bennun, The Broken String. The Last Words of an Extinct People, 3. 219</page><page sequence="7">that is alive in the present is a familiar frame that encloses the figuration of the 'Bushmen'. The product of a decades' worth of work, Bennun also presents an idyllic portrait of the relationship between Bleek and Lloyd and their informants, the latter 'exchanging prison walls for a furnished shed in a colonial garden', 'living in the furnished shed in the garden'.27 Conceding that 'Dorothea found it more difficult than Lucy Lloyd to transcend the racist climate of the South Africa of her day,'28 Bleek's complicity with colonialist racism is elided.29 Interspersing historical narrative with excerpts from the Bleek and Lloyd collection of folklore, letters and newspaper articles, Bennun attempts to meld together the colonial narrative with the /Xam material. This ambitious strategy is most effective when translations of meditations on mortality are juxtaposed with the narrative of Bleek's illness and death from tuberculosis. Particularly poignant is Diaîkwain's letter to Calvinia, translated by Lloyd, written three days after Wilhelm's death in search of information concerning the whereabouts of his sis- ter and her children. One of the achievements of this book is to convey a sense of the topog- raphy of the Cape, as the journeys and interrupted communications of the /Xam informants and their amanuenses are tracked over months, even years. The coincidence of Bleek and his future wife meeting in a Cape Town lodging is a moment in a long series of events; from Bleek's first aborted trip to the Congo that placed him in London and able to meet Colenso, to Jemima and her sisters' struggle with an overbearing and bankrupt father that compelled them to aban- don the family home in Durban. The epistolary courtship between Bleek and his bride-to-be in England reveals a side of Bleek, frail and without a steady income, rarely glimpsed in the conventional scholarship: Well these dreadful prospects of many years of spiritual and mental fasting make me sometimes very savage ... making me wish that slavery was a lawful institution, and that I was allowed to buy my dear sister as a slave, to keep her all for myself. But then I am afraid I should never be able to pay the price for a jewel so much valued as she is; and if I had it I should not be able to set it in proper fittings. But I see already your face thoroughly shocked at this . . . and must therefore implore you not to read the preceding last sentences, or if you have already read them to forget them altogether, except you should like to hear them, what indeed cannot well be disposed. If I had the least spirit of chevalerée in me I should have altered the proposition altogether and have supposed myself a humble slave, who craved to be bought by a master or a mistress he liked. But 27. Bennun, 38, 45. 28. Bennun, 337. 29.

As to my own predilection I should certainly prefer being a slave to being a slave owner.30 These meetings and the departure and arrival of /Xam from a forbidding interior powerfully convey the precarious nature of the colonial economy. The value of Bennun's cinematic narrative rests primarily on the weaving of various sources to give some sense of the challenges of settler life during that period, particularly for women. Grasping the past artistically- Nietzsche's classical his- tory responsive to the needs of life, as opposed to antiquarian history aiming at the truth31- employs shifting perspectives and free indirect discourse to build up a phenomenological sense of space and time. The point is to allow the reader to vicariously inhabit a colonial scene of longing that is thereby humanised.32 The reader is able to be the neutral third party between various communicants, an indulgence denied to those meshed in the historical narrative. Bennun feels free to interpolate and domesticate the /Xam material as he sees fit.33 In Hollmann's presentation the retention of Bleek and Lloyd's typo- orthographic notation and the parallel 'Xam text make it more difficult to ignore the process of inscription. In contrast with Hollmann, there is a lack of annotation in Bennun's book; for example, the letter quoted above is simply referenced as 'unpublished manuscripts in the Grey Collection at the National Library of South Africa'.34 In this Bennun and his publisher (like Dorothea) may be astute in read- ing the needs of the target market of general readers in search of an emotional journey unencumbered by scholarly paraphernalia. Part and parcel of this appeal is the false connection of the idyllic domestic scene, a type of screen memory35 in which an early memory is used as a screen for a traumatic later event. The latter may well be connected to (mis)recognition of the continuing dispossession and immiseration that accompanies post-apartheid development, now freed of overt racism but still operating within the husk of the same economic system. Bennun's contrasting of the reciprocal relation of the /Xam and their transla- tors with the horror of exterminatory Boer commandos and the machinations of the racist Langham Dale, chairman of the Committee of the South African Public Li- brary, certainly highlights the variegations in what is often taken to be a monolithic colonialist ideology. Yet Bleek and Lloyd, and Dorothea, were part of this mobile 30. W.H.I. Bleek in Bennun, 104-5. 31.

Hollmann reveals the haunting power of the co- lonial legacy when he writes: 4I use the word "Bushman" only as an adjective, referring to "Bushman people" rather than "Bushmen". In doing so I mean to refer to a unique South African culture, rather than to a means of describing a race of South African people'.36 The point that the perceived invisibility of the 'Bushman' descendants has arisen 'because they have lost their languages and their ancestry is no longer pure', and the conclusion that '[t]oday, however, South Africa's Bush- man descendants have been making themselves heard in a variety of ways, politi- cal and cultural',37 attempt to break with the racist past. Yet the bridging concepts of descent and culture risk transmitting the infrastructure of a discourse demanding critical reflection because of the history in question. 36. Hollmann, 4. 37.
