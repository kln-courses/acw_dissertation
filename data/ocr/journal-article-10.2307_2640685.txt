It is argued that easy popular appellations such as "selfish DNA" and "junk DNA" may be either inaccurate or misleading and that a more enlightened view of the transposable element-host relationship encompasses a continuum from extreme parasitism to mutualism. Transposable elements are potent, broad spectrum, endogenous mutators that are subject to the influence of chance as well as selection at several levels of biological organization. Of particular interest are transposable element traits that early evolve neutrally at the host level but at a later stage of evolution are co-opted for new host functions. Key words.-Gene regulation, genome evolution, parasitic DNA, retrotransposon, transposon. Received July 20, 1999. Accepted July 12, 2000. During the last thirty years, numerous families of trans- posable elements (TEs) have been discovered and character- ized in all species that have been adequately examined. Their ubiquity raises a number of questions concerning the nature of the relationships between TEs and their hosts and the significance and long-term consequences of these elements on the evolution of host genomes. The existence of these units of mobile DNA was largely unforeseen by classical geneticists during the first half of the 20th century. Divergent opinions about the relevance of TEs for the evolution of their hosts have been expressed over the years since their discovery in the mid- 1940s. For example, a number of authors have stressed the actual or potential benefits of TEs to their hosts, but have often not balanced this with a description of their other properties. In contrast, the selfish and junk DNA con- cepts have often been accepted blindly and rigidly to the exclusion of other host-element relationships. Although the concept of TEs as molecular parasites has been useful for understanding the nature of host-element relationships, this approach needs to be expanded to consider a possible con- tinuum of interactions between elements and their hosts, ranging from parasitism at one extreme, to mutualism or sym- biosis at the other (Brosius 1999a; Kidwell and Lisch 2000). We will argue that host-element relationships are so dynamic and intimate that any rigid distinction between the two is meaningless. The purpose of this article is to integrate a number of points of view to develop a balanced perspective of the evolution of eukaryotic TEs with that of their hosts. New experimental evidence bearing on these issues will also be described and discussed. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The relevance of TEs to the biology of their hosts was of considerable interest to Barbara McClintock, who discovered these elements in maize in the 1940s. Indeed she chose the name "controlling elements" because of the ability of these elements "to regulate gene expression in precise ways" (McClintock 1956, 1984). This perspective was consistent with the prevailing assumption of the time that all, or most, characteristics of organisms were adaptive and thus were sub- ject to positive natural selection. Later there was a growing awareness that a large fraction of many genomes was made up of noncoding sequences consisting largely of highly re- petitive and middle repetitive DNA. TEs were shown to con- stitute a physically significant component of the middle re- petitive DNA fraction in many eukaryotic genomes. The char- acteristics of these sequences made it difficult to determine an obvious function for the organism. The publication of Dawkins' The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1974) and the devel- opment of the neutral theory of molecular evolution (Kimura 1983) provided a backdrop for serious questioning of the I ?) 2001 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

In their classic papers, Doolittle and Sapienza (1980) and Orgel and Crick (1980) pointed out that the ubiquity of re- petitive sequences could be best explained by mechanisms independent of a direct selectable benefit to the host. The replicative advantage of TEs could explain their increase in frequency and maintenance in natural populations (natural selection at the level of DNA) without invoking a positive selective advantage at the level of the individual organism. Following the lead of Dawkins, the term "selfish DNA" was often used to describe the ability of mobile elements to am- plify in host genomes-a critical stage in their life style. The word "selfish" is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary to mean "Devotion to, or concern for, one's own advantage, or welfare, to the exclusion of regard for others." This clearly anthropomorphic term had value in capturing a property es- sential for the propagation of TEs. Unfortunately, the con- notation of exclusivity of interest that is implied in the def- inition, and emphasized by the original proponents, has often lead to disregard of other characteristics of TEs that may provide short and long-term benefits to hosts. The earlier, mistaken, notion that selfish DNA has "little or no phenotypic effects" (Dawkins 1974; Orgel and Crick 1980) has still not been totally abandoned, despite over- whelming evidence to the contrary. Similar to most other mutator mechanisms, TEs produce phenotypic effects that are deleterious to the fitness of the host organism and most of these will be removed from the host population over time by purifying natural selection. This idea was incorporated by Hickey (1982) who proposed a quantitative population ge- netics model for the evolution of transposable genetic ele- ments. This model demonstrated that "selfish" DNA se- quences do not necessarily have to be selectively neutral at the organismal level; indeed, a significant point was that such DNA can produce major deleterious effects in the host or- ganism and still spread through the population. Charlesworth et al. (1994) stressed the ability of "selfish DNA" to replicate within the genome, but also pointed out that the mutations induced can cause genetic diseases and confer significant fitness losses on the organism. The extent of fitness loss has been estimated quantitatively for P elements in Drosophila, (e.g., Fitzpatrick and Sved 1986; Mackay 1986, 1989; Mack- ay et al. 1992; Currie et al. 1998) and found to be significant. The demonstration that TEs can spread in host genomes despite a significant fitness loss has been explained by several authors as an example of natural selection acting in opposite directions at different levels of the biological hierarchy (e.g., Gould 1983; Kiyasu and Kidwell 1984; Good et al. 1989). At the most fundamental level of natural selection, that of DNA, the replicative advantage of TE sequences over non- mobile sequences allows their proliferation in genomes. This proliferation may be offset by negative selection, at the level of the individual host organism, in so far as organismal fitness is reduced by new, deleterious, TE-induced mutations. How- ever, selection for reduced transposition, at the level of the host, is a weak force compared to selection for increased transposition, at the level of the transposon (Charlesworth and Langley 1986). Besides producing neutral and deleterious effects, how- ever, TEs can also produce mutations and genomic changes that make significant contributions to the evolution of their hosts. In fact, there is increasing evidence that the activity of TEs can influence host phenotypes in many ways: some of their effects are immediate, direct, and obvious; others are very subtle and may take long periods of evolutionary time to fully manifest. A dramatic example of the former kind is a TE-induced mutation affecting a fitness trait that was re- cently reported in D. melanogaster (Lin et al. 1998). The life span of a mutant line of flies was extended approximately 35% over nonmutant lines. The mutant line also showed in- creased resistance to starvation, high temperature and other stress factors. This phenotype resulted from a P-element in- sertion in the third intron of the Methuselah (mth) gene. A more detailed examination of the evidence for more subtle TE-induced phenotypes is given below, following a brief introduction to the biology of TEs. Nature and Distribution of TEs TEs are DNA sequences that have the capacity to change genomic locations. This capacity may, or may not, be intrinsic to the element itself. Those elements that encode enzymes required for their own movement, or transposition, are de- scribed as autonomous. In contrast, nonautonomous elements are dependent on autonomous elements within the same or a different gene family for their movement. The "life cycle" of a TE in its host organism can be visualized as having three main phases (Fig. 1). Initially there is a rapid invasion phase in which amplification of copy number occurs accompanied by mutation which renders some elements inactive, followed by a stage of maturity of variable length, in which amplifi- cation and loss of copies are roughly in balance. Finally, a stage of senescence extends for possibly millions of years. At this stage, all autonomous elements have been lost, no amplification occurs, and nonautonomous sequences are ei- ther lost, become deleted, or otherwise diverge. Autonomous elements are represented by continuous lines and nonauton- omous elements by dashed lines. Like other molecular par- asites, many TEs are subject to high mutation rates (Nee and Maynard Smith 1990), and the frequency of nonautonomous elements is often high. Additional properties shared by most TEs include (1) variability in copy number; (2) insertion site polymorphism; and (3) the duplication of a few base pairs of host DNA at each end of every new element insertion site. TEs are divided into two main classes according to their structural organization and mechanism of transposition (Fin- negan 1989; Capy et al. 1997a). As members of the larger family of retroid agents that also includes retroviruses (Mc- Clure 1999), Class I elements use an RNA-mediated mode of transposition and encode a reverse transcriptase (RT). There are three distinct subclasses of eukaryotic RT-encoding TEs, the retrotransposons, the retroposons, and the retroin- trons (McClure 1999). The retroposons include the short in- terspersed nuclear elements (SINES) and the long inter- spersed nuclear elements (LINES). The Class II elements, the transposons (sensu strictu) use a DNA-mediated mode of transposition. In contrast to exogenous agents such as ret- roviruses that are transmitted both vertically and horizontally,</page><page sequence="3">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 3 INVASION Aniphlicataon s Occasional horizontal pification Inactive \ transfer SENESCENCE MATURITY I \ - \ t \ a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~at -vat Divergence Loss L-(ossN~ FIG. 1. General features of the life cycle of a Class II transposable element. Three main stages are illustrated: a rapid invasion phase in which amplification of copy number occurs accompanied by mutation which renders some elements inactive; a stage of maturity of variable length, when amplification and loss are roughly in balance; and a stage of senescence, possibly extending for millions of years, when all autonomous elements have been lost, no amplification occurs and nonautonomous sequences are lost or diverge. Autonomous elements are represented by continuous lines and nonautonomous elements by dashed lines. endogenous TEs are mainly -transmitted vertically with oc- casional exceptions (e.g., Robertson and Lampe 1995). TEs are present in copy numbers ranging from just a few elements to tens, or hundreds, of thousands per genome. In the latter case they can represent a major fraction of the genome, especially in some plants. For example, TEs have recently been estimated to make up more than 50% of the maize genome (SanMiguel et al. 1996). The genome of Homno sapiens contains more than a million copies of the Alu (SINE) family of elements (Smit and Riggs 1996), and more than 100,000 copies of the LI (LINE) element (Kazazian and Mor- an 1998). Identifiable TEs make up approximately 35% of the genome of our own species (Bestor 1998), and possibly as much as 50%, if diverged and degraded TEs are included. It is becoming increasingly recognized that the large fraction of human and other genomes consisting of TEs may be a manifestation of the evolutionary benefits of genomic flexi- bility (Henikoff et al. 1997). Because of their abundance, and the irreversible and in- dependent nature of their insertions, some TEs, such as SINES, provide very useful markers for phylogeny recon- struction (Shedlock and Okada 2000). For example, distinct families of Alu sequences have amplified so recently in hu- man evolution that they display significant amounts of in- terpopulational differences (Batzer et al. 1996). Polymorphic Alu insertions can therefore be very useful for tracing the evolutionary history of individual populations. Origin and Evolutionary History The appearance of a new TE family within a species can be explained in one of two different ways. TEs can originate spontaneously from non-transposable sequences as shown with human Alu elements (Quentin 1992). Alternatively, TEs can be transferred horizontally between species (Daniels et al. 1990; Robertson and Lampe 1995). Although the fre- quency of horizontal transfer is low, it seems to be higher for TEs than for conventional genes (Kidwell 1993; Capy et al. 1994). This makes sense because the intrinsic properties of TEs that enable them to move within genomes also oc- casionally allow them to transfer between individuals of dif- ferent species. The specific mechanisms responsible for hor- izontal transfer of TEs remain elusive. Although the de novo appearance of TEs is possible, by far the majority of individuals inherit their TEs by vertical transmission from their parents. At least some domains of most TE lineages appear to have ancient common origins (Capy et al. 1997b). Their molecular phylogenies can be re- constructed from sequence data in a manner similar to those of conventional genes. However, the phylogenies of TEs are often incongruent with phylogenies based on nonmobile genes from the same host species. Lack of congruence is most often due to horizontal transfer, species hybridization, or ancient polymorphisms. These explanations are not nec- essarily mutually exclusive. In addition, phylogenies based on different regions, or domains, of the same elements may produce incongruent phylogenies due to occasional xenolo- gous recombination (the replacement of a resident gene by a homologous foreign gene). For example, phylogenies based on different domains found within some retrotransposons are sometimes not congruent with one another (McClure 1991). Thus the evolution of TEs is most accurately traced though the phylogenies of individual domains rather than through the phylogenies of whole elements. For example, the RT domain of Class I elements may have originated from group II introns, after migrating from organelles to the nucleus of early eukaryotes (Cavalier-Smith 1991; Capy et al. 1997b). Although it is premature to understand the ultimate origins of TEs with a strong degree of confidence, it appears that their evolution has occurred predominantly by the serial ad- dition of domains. However, the reverse process, deletion or loss of domains, also appears to have occurred in some lin- eages (Capy et al. 1997a). Both integrase/transposase and RT</page><page sequence="4">4 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R. LISCH domains seem likely to have evolved from bacteria, and have been assembled in eukaryotes, leading to retrotransposons and then to retroviruses by the acquisition of an envelope gene (Capy et al. 1997b). Therefore it seems likely that some, but not all eukaryotic TEs or parts of TEs, have an ancient bacterial origin. However, TEs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes have a very different evolutionary biology (Nee and Maynard Smith 1990), and this essay will mainly be restricted to con- sideration of TEs in eukaryotes. SOURCES OF NEW GENETIC VARIATION Major Roles in Early Evolution? Questions concerning the origin and early evolution of TEs may never be unambiguously resolved. It is possible, for example, that Retroid agents are the descendants of the agents responsible for conversion of RNA to DNA in the ancient world (McClure 1999). Various authors have also speculated that TEs have played important roles during the evolution of life as we know it today, as illustrated in the following ex- amples: (1) At an early stage of biological evolution, it has been proposed that small modules, or duplication units, that con- stituted the first exons may have been the ultimate building blocks for protein assembly and that these modules were highly mobile (Dwyer 1998). Transposition and splicing of modules was further postulated to lead to increasingly com- plex proteins, as well as multigene families of proteins. (2) It has been conjectured that parasitic elements, such as transposons and introns, might have provided the genes re- sponsible for the establishment of the sexual cycle in eu- karyotic organisms (Hickey 1982; Hickey and Rose 1988; Bell 1993). (3) TEs may have played a critical role in two major mac- roevolutionary events: the origin of eukaryotes and the origin of vertebrates (McDonald 1998). The rationale for this prop- osition is that TEs were the driving force for the evolution of the two major epigenetic mechanisms, chromatin forma- tion and methylation, that were prerequisites for the quantum expansions in gene number that accompanied the emergence of the eukaryotes and vertebrates, respectively (Bird 1995). Broad-Spectrum Mutator Mechanisms It is becoming apparent that TEs likely play an especially useful role as mutators in evolution because of the broad spectrum of mutations produced by their activity. The genetic changes induced by TE activity range from modifications in the size and arrangement of whole genomes to substitutions, deletions, and insertions of a single nucleotide. TEs, like other mutators, can produce major effects on phenotypic traits or small silent changes that are detectable only at the DNA sequence level. Furthermore, the spectrum of TE-induced mutations is arguably broader than that produced by any other mutator mechanism. It is important to note that TEs produce their mutagenic effects not simply on initial insertion into host DNA. They may also produce mutations when they ex- cise imprecisely, leaving either no identifying sequence, or only small "footprints" of their previous presence. In ad- dition, some TE-induced mutations that are of evolutionary significance to their hosts, such as mutations in regulatory sequences (Britten 1996a), may take long periods of time to evolve these new beneficial functions. Consequently, they may have lost their original identification as TEs. For these reasons, the properties of TE sequences in the genomes of contemporary species of animals and plants may not ade- quately reflect the properties of elements that have had a long association with their host species. It has recently become apparent that a hierarchy of mu- tational events is required for the rapid generation of protein diversity in evolution (Bogarad and Deem 1999). Although simple DNA base substitutions are well suited for the gen- eration, diversification, and optimization of local protein space (Maeshiro and Kimura 1998), a hierarchy of natural mutational events is required for the rapid generation of pro- tein diversity. Experimental evolution (Moore et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1997; Crameri et al. 1998) and computer sim- ulation experiments (Bogarad and Deem 1999) showed that sequence shuffling has the potential to improve protein func- tion significantly better than does point mutation alone. Be- cause they are uniquely competent to reshuffle DNA se- quences, TEs and viruses are important generators of the more complex types of mutations in the mutational hierarchy. Another interesting aspect of the mutator role of TEs in plant evolution is their relative silence during normal de- velopment and their activation by stresses, including wound- ing, pathogen attack, and cell culture (Wessler 1996). Qui- escence during normal development can be seen as a mech- anism to ensure against massive and potentially catastrophic expression that would lower the fitness of both the host and the element. An increase in transposition rate following stress could have evolved as a way to guarantee that at least one offspring of the stressed individual would carry a transpos- itionally competent TE, but the effect of the consequent spike in the mutation rate of the host could be advantageous to the host's offspring by providing new variation at a time when it would be likely to be needed. Additionally, the evolution of conditionally expressed TEs may have other benefits to the host as well. The tissue-specific expression of B] and B2 SINE RNAs of mice in vivo, together with evidence for regulated changes in their expression by physiological stresses is highly suggestive that these elements perform a function important to their hosts (Li et al. 1999). The Role of TEs in Restructuring Genomes The ability of TEs to induce chromosomal mutations has been appreciated for some time. Indeed, McClintock saw genome restructuring mediated by TE activity as an essential component of the hosts' response to stress (McClintock 1978). In addition to movement and insertion of sequences of more than a few nucleotides, either spontaneously or by transduction, transposon activity can also result in large scale changes in host genome. A number of ways that TEs influence genome structure are now briefly described. Insertion and excision. The insertion of TEs can disrupt or alter gene function in a number of ways. TEs that insert within the exons of genes are most likely to result in null mutations because of the sensitivity of these regions to frame shift mutations and the lack of tolerance of highly conserved</page><page sequence="5">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 5 regions to mutations of any kind. However, those mutations that survive the selection process can provide interesting and sometimes spectacular phenotypic variability (Kidwell and Lisch 1997). A large number of TE insertions are fixed within some mammalian species, leaving open the possibility that a subset of insertions has been subject to positive selection (Deininger 1989). In addition to their role in insertional mutagenesis, TEs may generate evolutionarily significant genetic variation through the excision process (reviewed by Wessler 1988). This is because excision of a TE from a host insertion site is often not precise. The excision process may result in either the addition of new sequences or deletion of host sequences flanking the insertion site (Schiefelbein et al. 1988). A par- ticularly interesting recent example of sequence addition with potentially important evolutionary implications is provided by the Ds-like transposon Ascot-i in the fungus Ascobolus immersus (Colot et al. 1998). A study of excision products of this element in a spore-color gene revealed small palin- dromic nucleotide additions in many of them. A number of parallels are suggested between the excision reaction of these and other hAT transposons, on the one hand, and V(D)J re- combination, on the other. However, whereas the latter is a somatic process with little direct evolutionary consequence, the addition of small palindromic additions in the excision of hAT transposons can occur during meiosis with the po- tential to contribute significantly to germline variability and the evolution of phenotypic traits. Ectopic recombination.-Multigene families are suscepti- ble to nonhomologous or ectopic recombination in which genetic exchange takes place, either intrachromosomally or interchromosomally, between two members of the family lo- cated in different chromosomal regions. Such events can lead to duplications, deficiencies, and new linkage relationships, often with consequent fitness reduction. This can potentially lead to selection against increases in copy number and is considered by some (e.g., Charlesworth et al. 1997) to be a more important factor in containing TE copy number than selection against insertion mutations (Biemont et al. 1997). However, some products of nonhomologous exchange do survive and have been documented to affect genome orga- nization. For example, evidence was provided by Kim et al. (1998) that Ty retrotransposons are important in the formation of chromosomal rearrangements. They conducted a genome- wide survey of Saccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposons and identified a total of 331 insertions of members of five TE families. There was evidence for recombination near many of these elements, and 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences were often duplicated and rearranged among multiple chro- mosomes. This suggests that recombination between retro- transposons has occurred relatively frequently and has had an important influence on both genome organization (Kim et al. 1998) and the evolution of the Ty family of elements itself (Jordan and McDonald 1998). The multiplicity of SINES and LINES in the human ge- nome, described above, provides a good substrate for unequal recombination. Thirty three cases of germline genetic dis- eases and 16 cases of cancer were reported to be caused by unequal homologous exchange between Alu elements, rep- resenting a significant fraction of human diseases (0.3%) (Deininger and Batzer 1999). Less frequent, but still impor- tant is unequal recombination between LINE elements in hu- mans. For example a 7.5 kb deletion of genomic DNA results from unequal exchange between two neighboring LINE-1 sequences, giving rise to glycogen storage disease through phosphorylase kinase deficiency (Burwinkel and Kilimann 1998). Unequal exchange among LINE elements also gives rise to Alport syndrome and associated diffuse leiomyoma- tosis, a syndrome of disseminated smooth-muscle tumors in- volving the esophagus, large airways, and female reproduc- tive tract (Segal et al. 1999). Translocations and inversions.-Besides insertions and de- letions, the activity of TEs is known to be associated with the production of a number of chromosomal structural chang- es, such as translocations and inversions. For example, many break points in hybrid dysgenesis-induced chromosomal re- arrangements were shown to occur at, or very near to, the sites of P and hobo element insertions (Engels and Preston 1984; Lim 1988). In a similar way, a significant fraction of break points of newly induced chromosomal rearrangement induced by hybrid dysgenesis in D. virilis were found to contain Penelope and Ulysses TEs (Evgen'ev et al. unpubl. ms.). Furthermore, a TE, named Odysseus, was recently dis- covered at the distal breakpoint of a polymorphic inversion in Anopheles arabiensis (Mathiopoulos et al. 1998). There are several possible mechanisms by which a chromosomal inversion might be formed, including ectopic recombination between two inverted TE copies, or breakage at or near the site of insertion of two elements in the same orientation, with subsequent inversion of the intervening sequences. TEs are more likely to be found associated with endemic inversions than cosmopolitan ones, because of the tendency of TEs to be lost over time from inversion break points (Engels and Preston 1984; Mathiopoulos et al. 1998). Pseudogene formation and genome duplication.-In addi- tion to the mutagenic effects of insertion and excision of TEs themselves, these elements may play a significant role in genome reorganization by promoting the insertion of other gene sequences and the formation of pseudogenes (Brosius 1999). For example, Esnault et al. (2000) have recently dem- onstrated the ability of human LINEs to mobilize transcribed DNA not associated with a LINE sequence. The formation of processed pseudogenes by LINE-mediated retroposition may thus be an important mechanism for genome duplication and genome remodeling. There is evidence that among the retroelements, pseudogene formation may be specific to LINEs (Esnault et al. 2000). Transposon transduction and exon shuffling.-Some TEs can provide a vehicle for the mobilization of flanking se- quences accompanying aberrant transposition events. Gene sequences, such as exons or promoters, can be transduced and inserted into other existing genes and may provide a general mechanism for the evolution of new genes. An ele- gant demonstration of "exon retroshuffling," that is, exon shuffling mediated by the human LI element, has been re- ported in tissue culture cells (Moran et al. 1999). They showed that LI can efficiently comobilize a 3' flanking se- quence of non-LI DNA to new genomic locations. The trans- duction of downstream sequences by endogenous LI ele- ments were also earlier documented in humans, (e.g., Holmes</page><page sequence="6">6 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R.

Schematic representation of the retrotransposed gene encoding the C gamma catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Cay). Open reading frame of C-y gene, Alu element insertions, Poly A remnants, 11 bp direct repeats, and putative TATA box are all as indicated. The new hybrid gene contains components of both transposon and host genes. Importantly, the regulation of expression of this gene is likely to be mediated by flanking transposon sequences (from Reinton et al. 1998). et al. 1994; McNaughton et al. 1997). The potential signif- icance of transposon-mediated transduction for host evolu- tion has recently been highlighted, using a bioinformatics approach (Pickeral et al. 2000). Computational analysis of human genome sequences indicated that at least 10% of 129 full-length active Li elements have an associated putative 3'-transduced segment. Extrapolating this result to the whole genome, at least 1% of the human genome may represent sequences transduced by Li elements (Pickeral et al. 2000). A specialized transducing transposon Tpnl, has been rec- ognized in the Japanese morning glory (Takahashi et al. 1999). Tpnl is a Class II element that is found in the second intron of the Dfr-B gene for flower pigmentation, in the mu- table line "flecked" that shows variegation for flower color. In this location the element has apparently captured a ge- nomic DNA segment containing at least four host exon se- quences. Among the Mu elements of maize, the nonauton- omous element Mul is homologous to a host gene, Mrs-A (Mu-related sequence) (Talbert and Chandler 1988). More recent database searches, using other nonautonomous Mu el- ements, reveal that all of them appear to contain transduced host sequences (D. R. Lisch, unpubl. results). The presence of large amounts of RT has also facilitated the production of large numbers of intronless pseudogenes in many organisms. In some cases, these retrotransposed genes have acquired new functions, either as a direct con- sequence of mutation during retrotransposition, and/or be- cause of the acquisition of new regulatory functions at their new position. A recent example is provided by Cg, the gene encoding the Cy catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent pro- tein kinase in humans (Reinton et al. 1998). This gene, which is expressed specifically in the testis, is an apparently func- tional retrotransposed portion of the homologous Ca gene. The Cy gene lacks introns, contains a remnant of a poly(A) tail, and is flanked by direct repeats. Given that this gene can be translated in vitro (Foss et al. 1994), is expressed in a highly regulated manner (Beebe et al. 1992), and is conserved in monkeys and humans, it is very likely to produce a func- tional protein. As the start of transcription of this gene is likely to be located outside the retrotransposed portion of the gene (in an Alu element), it is likely that its tissue specificity arose because of borrowed signals from its new position (See Fig. 2). Genomic interspersion patterns.-It is possible that TEs may play an important role in the determination of genomic interspersion patterns. The kinds and numbers of transposable elements can vary radically in different species. This becomes quite apparent when comparing TE compliments in D. me- lanogaster and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. More than thirty families of transposable elements have re- cently been found in A. aegypti (Z. Tu, pers. comm.). These include a number of families of highly repetitive miniature inverted repeat transposons (MITEs) (Tu 1997), non-LTR retrotransposons (Tu et al. 1998), and a family of SINEs (Tu 1999). The three families of LTR retrotransposons in A. ae- gypti are low in copy number (Warren et al. 1997; Z. Tu, unpubl. data). Many of these TEs tend to be associated with other families of TEs, which is one of the reasons why so many families of TEs have been discovered in a relatively short period of time. In addition, some of the TEs, especially the MITEs, tend to be associated with genes in A. aegypti. The genome of A. aegypti is approximately 800 Mb, five times larger than that of its dipteran relative, D. melanogaster. In addition, the A. aegypti genome is organized in a "short period interspersion pattern" while the D. melanogaster ge- nome is organized in a "long period interspersion pattern". It is possible that the presence of highly repetitive MITEs, SINEs, and non-LTR retrotransposons may have contributed to the pattern of short period interspersion in A. aegypti. Genome size and the C value paradox.-Although basal genome sizes (C values) of Archea and Eubacteria vary only by about an order of magnitude (Krawiec and Riley 1990),</page><page sequence="7">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 7 those of eukaryotes vary &gt;80,000 fold (Li 1997). In turn, some taxonomic groups of eukaryotes, such as birds, mam- mals, and teleost fishes show little variation in basal genome size (Gregory and Hebert 1999). Others, such as many plants and invertebrates, often show patterns of quantum shifts of C-values. The mechanisms responsible for quantum size jumps are only poorly understood, but it seems clear that, along with other mechanisms such as polyploidization, the amplification of TEs is a major contributing mechanism. There is now increasing evidence that both shifts in intron lengths, and in the amounts of other noncoding DNA, are driven by genome-wide changes in deletion and insertion frequencies (Petrov et al. 1996; Gregory and Hebert 1999). In turn, C-values are generally positively correlated with cell and nuclear volume (Cavalier-Smith 1982). Changes in ge- nome size, through their influence on cell size can be subject to strong selection pressures acting on the organismal phe- notype under certain conditions (Gregory and Hebert 1999). Chromosome inactivation and speciation. Whereas the mobilization of TEs has been shown to be associated with high rates of karyotypic change in Drosophila (Lim 1988) and yeast (Codon et at. 1997), a direct link between TEs and speciation has not been demonstrated. Although it was earlier thought that hybrid dysgenesis could, under some conditions, lead to speciation (e.g., Ginzburg et al. 1984), no clear ex- perimental evidence supports this idea. Some computer sim- ulations suggest that the necessary combination of conditions would be only infrequently present (J. M. C. Ribeiro, pers. comm.). An interesting alternative model was used by McFadden and Knowles (1997) to investigate the effect of transposon-mediated mutations in populations of asexual dig- ital organisms as they compete for resources in an adaptive landscape. In contrast to nontransposon mutations, deleteri- ous transposon-induced mutations allowed populations to es- cape evolutionary stasis and promoted speciation events. The enriched occurrence of the TRAM element in the evolving neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda provides strong evidence in favor of the view that Y chromosome degeneration is driven by the accumulation of transposable elements (Steinemann and Steinemann 1997). Also the mas- sive amplification of retroelements in a single generation in wallaby species hybrids (O'Neill et al. 1998) provides an impressive example of the capacity of TEs to change the structural architecture of host genomes without disrupting the normal functioning of somatic cells. In this study, ge- nome-wide undermethylation of retroelements sequences was demonstrated in a species hybrid, in contrast to the normal methylation of nonhybrid parents. Similar observations of deficient methylation and spontaneous chromosome changes were also reported in other mammalian hybrids. Such changes have the potential to facilitate rapid karyotypic evolution, but, again, the potential for these hybrids to produce new species remains speculative. This area of research appears to be ripe for further investigation. TE SURVIVAL STRATEGIES AND THE ECOLOGY OF THE GENOME The Parasitic-Mutualistic Continuum In our introduction, we asserted that the concept of self- ishness was valuable in bringing out a property of TEs that is essential for understanding the ability of these elements to invade and spread in genomes, but the use of this term as the sole descriptor tends to be misleading as it excludes the possibility of the evolution of significant beneficial properties of TEs in a species genome. Indeed, description of TEs in terms of host-parasite relationships, rather than selfish DNA has been preferred by a number of writers. Although the expected dynamics of molecular parasites have not yet been rigorously addressed (see Nee and Maynard Smith 1990), it may be useful to consider whether some of the theory ap- plicable to nonmolecular host-parasite associations may be applicable to molecular parasites. For example, the old conventional wisdom that a well adapted parasite is invariably a benign parasite can no longer be defended (e.g., Ewald 1995). Modern theory predicts that the degree of virulence of parasites depends on a number of factors, such as a parasite's mode of transmission, the degree of host mobility, and the evolutionary response of the host to the parasite. A strong host response to TE invasion may lead to an "arms race" between the host and the parasite. Indeed the relationship between hosts and TEs has been char- acterized by some authors in just this way (e.g., McDonald 1998). Again, this appears to be just one of several possible aspects of the association that may develop in specific cases, rather than representing a universal characteristic of the TE- host relationship. One possibly useful application of host-parasite theory to TEs relates to modes of transmission. Modern theory predicts that vertical transmission should favor evolution towards par- asite benignness (Ewald 1995). Experimental work on plas- mids and viruses has provided evidence that restriction of horizontal transfer between bacteria leads to a loss of viru- lence (Bouma and Lenski 1988; Bull and Rice 1991). In the case of TEs, the predominant mode of transmission is vertical inheritance from one generation to the next. Phylogenetic analysis of some retrotransposon families has indicated that horizontal transfer between species rarely, if ever, occurs. In contrast, Class II elements, notably the mariner and P fam- ilies, tend to have a significantly higher frequency of hori- zontal transfer than Class I elements. Is there evidence that the relationship of Class I elements with their hosts is more benign than the more frequently horizontally transferred Class II elements? Perhaps the very low rates of transposition of some Class I elements (Nuzhdin and Mackay 1994) may be interpreted in this way. Rather than labeling TE-host associations as either selfish or parasitic, we prefer the idea of a continuum, ranging from aggressive parasitism at one extreme, through a neutral mid- dle ground, to mutualism at the other extreme (Ewald 1987). It seems likely that the association of a specific element with its host might vary along this continuum, perhaps according to the length of association with the host. In particular, we might expect a recently invaded element family to have strong parasitic tendencies. Later, if strong host defenses evolve, then an arm race may occur. However, without strong host defenses, the documented high frequency of vertical transfer might be expected to promote long TE-host associations with coevolution towards the mutualistic end of the continuum. Therefore, while the characteristics of modern invasions may be best described as parasitic, this term is inappropriate for</page><page sequence="8">8 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R. LISCH the established lineages of TEs that have coevolved with their hosts and are now integral to host function (McClure 1999). Contrary to a strict parasite-host relationship, the associ- ation of TEs with their hosts over evolutionary time can, in a number of circumstances, lead to a revolutionary process that drives the evolution of three types of mechanisms or changes: (1) The coevolution of TE-derived mechanisms to minimize negative effects on the host (and thus, indirectly on the TE). In this category are included transposon self- regulation, tissue specificity, targeting and genome partition- ing. (2) The evolution of host defense mechanisms. In this category are included the evolution of epigenetic effects and host suppressors. (3) The evolution of new and altered host functions and large scale genomic changes; these new host functions are frequently achieved by the recruitment of TE functions. THE COEVOLUTION OF MECHANISMS TO MINIMIZE HOST NEGATIVE EFFECTS Transposon Self-Regulation Self-regulation refers to a property of TEs themselves that allows them to regulate their own rate of transposition. It has been shown theoretically that self-regulation of TEs does not evolve if increased copy number alone is responsible for deleterious effects on host fitness (Charlesworth and Langley 1986). However, if the deleterious effects are immediate and occur as a direct consequence of transposition itself, then there may be a selective advantage to elements with reduced transposition rates that allow them to spread in the genome (reviewed by Brookfield 1995). The transposition of P elements in D. melanogaster has been shown to result in a significant loss of fitness (Fitzpat- rick and Sved 1986; Mackay 1989) and the P element system shows clear evidence for self-regulation. P activity in D. melanogaster is regulated by two types of element-encoded repressor products. A 66-kD, P element-encoded, repressor of transposition and excision is responsible for a cellular condition known as P cytotype (Robertson and Engels 1989). The genomic location of repressor elements determines the maternal versus zygotic inheritance of P cytotype (Misra and Rio 1990). A second type of P element-encoded repressor of P element transposition has large internal deletions, is sen- sitive to genomic location, but shows no maternal inheritance (Engels 1996). A similar example in maize is provided by the product of one of the genes encoded by this element, tnpA, which can protect Spm from methylation, but may also act as a repressor of Spm (Fedoroff et al. 1995; Schlappi et al. 1994). Additionally, as with P elements, some deleted Spm elements can repress full length Spni elements in trans (Cuypers et al. 1988). Tissue Specificity of Transposition The restriction of transposition to the germline appears to be a highly efficient strategy for TEs to ensure transmission to the next generation yet minimize damage to the host. Such a strategy appears to have been adopted by a broad range of elements. For example, expression of active LINE- I sequenc- es appears to be favored in cells of germ line origin in the human (Singer et al. 1993) and mouse (Trelogan and Martin 1995) genomes. Also, the expression of intracisternal A-par- ticles (1APs) in the mouse genome was found to be essentially restricted to the male germ line (Dupressoir and Heidmann 1996). The P and I elements in D. melanogaster also provide good examples of the restriction of transposition to the germ line. In the case of the P element, the 2-3 intron is spliced only in germ cells. The absence of transposase in somatic cells results from the production of a truncated 66-kD protein due to a premature stop codon following a frameshift. Two different proteins encoded by host genes have been impli- cated in the somatic inhibition (Siebel et al. 1992, 1995). Among plants, one of the two genes encoded by the MuDR transposon in maize is specifically expressed only in those cells that are potentially transmitted to the next generation. Expression of this gene is down-regulated in terminally dif- ferentiated tissue and markedly up-regulated in floral tissues (Donlin et al. 1995). Nonrandom Distributions and Genome Partitioning Although TEs have been found in nearly every portion of host genomes examined, their distributions are decidedly nonrandom. For example, in the compact genome of yeast, the Tyl, Ty2, Ty3 and Ty4 retroelement families, target the upstream region of the RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes. In contrast, the Ty5 family inserts into silenced regions of the genome such as the telomeres and mating type loci (Kim et al. 1998). In addition to Het-A and TART that ex- clusively target telomere ends of Drosophila (Biessmann and Mason 1997; Levis et al. 1993; Pardue et al. 1996), copia retrotransposons found in Allium cepea (Pearce et al. 1996) and two retroposons, Zepp from Chlorella (Higashiyama et al. 1997) and SART] from Bombyx mori are preferentially inserted into telomeric repeats (Takahashi et al. 1997). Repetitive elements are found in heterochromatic clusters in many less compact genomes, such as Drosophila. In theory, this distribution can be partially explained by increased sur- vival in heterochromatic, compared with euchromatic, ge- nomic locations, as a direct consequence of the differing density of genes in the two types of chromatin. However, experiments in D. melanogaster have provided no support for the hypothesis that the primary reason for accumulation of TEs in heterochromatin is selection against TEs inserted into euchromatin, either directly at insertion sites or indirectly through ectopic recombination (Dimitri and Junakovic 1999). In contrast, there is evidence for specific targeting of some heterochromatic regions. For example, the lethal mutation frequency induced by the I element in 13 loci located in the proximal heterochromatin of D. melanogaster chromosome 2 was about an order of magnitude higher than that of eu- chromatic genes located on the same chromosome (Dimitri et al. 1997). These data provide evidence that I elements transpose with high frequency into pericentric regions of chromosome 2 that are enriched with heterochromatin. Fur- ther, even within heterochromatin, TEs are not evenly dis- tributed. In one study, all of 11 elements examined in D. melanogaster exhibited preferential and discrete clustering into specific heterochromatic regions, suggesting that differ- ent elements may have distinct insertional preferences (Pim-</page><page sequence="9">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 9 pinelli et al. 1995). This clustering was also observed for P and hobo element insertions, despite their relatively recent arrival into the D. melanogaster genome (Kidwell 1994; Sim- mons 1992). An extreme example of local clustering is found in maize in which nearly all of the 240 kb between two host genes was composed of retrotransposon sequences (SanMiguel et al. 1996). Many of these elements are inserted into other elements, suggesting that they target their own kind for in- sertion. The region between maize genes is much less re- combinogenic than are the genes themselves, suggesting that recombination between these elements (which is likely to be disastrous for the host) is suppressed (Civardi et al. 1994). Thus, it appears that the intergenic regions of maize represent a specific domain of the maize genome specialized for hab- itation by retrotransposons. Not all TEs target heterochromatin, however. Like the re- troelements, miniature inverted repeat transposons (MITEs) are present in high copy number in maize (Wessler et al. 1995). Despite their ubiquity, MITEs are found almost ex- clusively in or near host genes, suggesting their exclusion from the specialized domain inhabited by retrotransposons (Zhang et al. 2000). Similarly, Mu elements, highly muta- genic transposons in maize, show strong preference for single copy sequences (Cresse et al. 1995), suggesting that they too are excluded from the intergenic concentrations of retroele- ments. The nonrandom distribution of clusters of TEs, in a variety of organisms, suggests that genomes can be partitioned into a variety of "ecological niches," which can be exploited in different ways by different transposons. The formation of these niches, as well as their exploitation by the transposons, is most likely a result of a long-term interaction between host and parasite. Heterochromatin proteins can recognize and si- lence transposable elements (Fanti et al. 1998), some of which are known to target heterochromatin for insertion (Ter- rinoni et al. 1997). Thus, the evolution of heterochromatin could have lead to a self-perpetuating expansion of domains rich in transposable elements. Transposons that avoid het- erochromatin and specifically target gene sequences, like the Mu elements of maize, may be taking advantage of the open chromatin configuration and local concentration of transcrip- tion factors around host genes, but at the cost of increased selection against new insertions. Not surprisingly, the copy number of this class of elements in maize is orders of mag- nitude lower than that of the retroelements. MITE elements, on the other hand, can be present in extremely high numbers (Wessler et al. 1995). However, they are very small, and are found almost exclusively in untranslated portions of host genes, either because of selection, or because their insertion profile represents yet another ecological niche. The evolution of large scale domains within genomes can have a significant effect on host evolution. Through inves- tigation of Position Effect Variegation in D. melanogaster, it is known that heterochromatin can affect the expression of adjacent genes (reviewed by Henikoff 1996) and there is strong evidence that local chromatin configuration has a basic role in the unfolding of the developmental program in species as diverse as Drosophila (reviewed by Pirrotta 1996) and mice (van der Lugt et al. 1994). Although it is not known whether transposons were the factor that caused heterochro- matin to evolve in the first place, because of the intimate relationship between TEs and various aspects of chromatin organization it seems likely that their coevolution has af- fected the means by which the genome is structured and thus some of the ways that host genes are expressed. Mobile Introns If, as has been suggested (Orgel and Crick 1980), nuclear introns evolved from a form of self-splicing transposon, these introns are among the most ancient and well-adapted mobile elements. Although they may have evolved the capacity to be spliced from mRNA to minimize their effect on host gene expression, they have become intimately tied to the biology of the host. Not only can differential splicing affect protein expression (e.g., Larsson et al. 1997), but introns can carry enhancers (Gillies et al. 1983; Muller et al. 1999), or re- pressors (Wight and Dobretsova 1997) of transcription. Be- cause of their position within gene sequences they have be- come an integral mechanism for the modulation of gene ex- pression. One school of thought holds that spliceosomal nuclear in- trons evolved from an ancestor similar to two extant classes of self-splicing introns found in the genomes of organelles such as the mitochondria. These exceptional classes of introns provide clues as to the structure of the ancient transposon- like progenitors of the predominant class of nuclear introns found in most eukaryotic genes. Group II introns present in some yeast mitochondrial genes are mobile elements that encode a protein that has maturase, reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities. Group II introns of plastids can also encode reverse transcriptase (Nat- vig et al. 1984). These introns are self-splicing and can move to both allelic and nonallelic targets. The ability to move to intronless allelic sites is called retrohoming (Curcio and Bel- fort 1996). Group I introns are mobile self-splicing elements found mainly in nuclear rRNA genes and the genomes of organelles. An intron found in the mitochondrial coxl gene has a wide- spread but patchy distribution in angiosperms. Four lines of evidence lead Cho et al. (1998) to conclude that the 48 an- giosperm genera found to contain this coxi intron acquired it by 32 separate horizontal transfer events. This explosive invasion appears to have been entirely of recent occurrence and illustrates the similarities of mobile introns and TEs. Group I and II introns both encode homing endonucleases, an enzyme involved in site-specific double-stranded DNA cleavage. Due to their capacity to rapidly spread throughout a given population, evidence for frequent horizontal trans- mission, and widespread but sometimes patchy distribution, homing endonucleases are generally considered to by highly effective parasites whose frequent association with introns and inteins ensures relative invisibility to selective pressures. There is evidence, however, that some homing endonucleases have been coopted for use by hosts. For instance, it has been suggested that HO endonuclease in yeast, which is required for mating-type conversion, may have evolved from an orig- inally selfish-intron-encoded homing endonuclease (Gimble 2000). In another remarkable example, an intronic E. coli</page><page sequence="10">10 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R. LISCH homing endonuclease functions to kill off competing strains of E. coli by cleaving their DNA (James et al. 1996). EVOLUTION OF HOST DEFENSES Epigenetic Effects A fundamental problem facing all complex multicellular organisms is that of selective gene expression. For proper differentiation to occur, a given cell must only express a subset of its genes and that pattern of expression must be heritable in a given differentiated lineage. Heritable changes in gene expression, in the absence of changes in the DNA, are referred to as epigenetic changes. Along with differen- tiation in multicellular organisms, epigenetic alterations in gene expression are associated with phenomena as diverse as X chromosome inactivation in mammals, transgene si- lencing in plants, and selective gene expression in some bac- teria (reviewed by Torreblanca and Casadesus 1996). One of the more prevalent and intriguing epigenetic mech- anisms involves cytosine methylation of DNA. We should note here that although we have chosen to focus on it here because of its frequent association with changes in TE ac- tivity, methylation is just one of a variety of interrelated epigenetic mechanisms that can inactivate TEs, including those such as chromatin remodeling and double-stranded RNA mediated silencing. In hosts, cytosine methylation of promoters is known to inhibit transcription (Meehan et al. 1992; Muiznieks and Doerfler 1994), and is heritable (Wigler 1981). Because it can repress transcriptional activity and can be replicated via mechanisms which recognize hemimethylated DNA, meth- ylation is an appealing explanation for heritable alterations in gene expression. Indeed, genetic imprinting, which in- volves the specific inactivation of an allele from one parent, is associated with methylation of the inactive allele (Li et al. 1993), and failures in imprinting are associated with a number of diseases (Reik and Maher 1997). Further, mice that are homozygous for a mutation (Dnrnt) in a mammalian methyl transferase die soon after gastrulation, implying that meth- ylation function is essential for normal mammalian devel- opment (Li et al. 1992). In a similar way, Arabidopsis plants homozygous for an antisense version of a plant methyltrans- ferase cDNA (METI) exhibit a number of developmental ab- normalities (Finnegan et al. 1996). Inactive X chromosomes in mammals are known to be extensively methylated (re- viewed by Singer-Sam and Riggs 1993), suggesting that methylation plays an important role in the normal repression of one copy of the female X chromosome. Because of these kinds of correlations, methylation has long been viewed as an essential component of the epigenetic regulation of mammalian genes that evolved to make differ- entiation in complex organisms possible (Holliday and Pugh 1975). However, that hypothesis has recently been challenged by the view that methylation evolved as a genomic defense against parasitic DNA (Barlow 1993; Yoder et al. 1997). These authors argue that, what has been interpreted as reg- ulation of host genes is in fact a system that evolved to repress transposon activity. Similarly, it has been argued that trans- gene transcriptional silencing in plants, which is often as- sociated with DNA methylation, is clearly related to the de- fense of the plant genome against repetitive or foreign DNA (reviewed by Matzke and Matzke 1998). In mammals, TEs are interspersed within the host genes (Yoder et al. 1997), and a majority of those elements are methylated soon after implantation (Monk et al. 1987; Sanford et al. 1987). Thus, it has been suggested that what had been believed to be a carefully regulated change in the methylation status in the host genes represents instead efforts of the host to down- regulate the activity of these interspersed TE sequences. Interestingly, one of the first cases of epigenetic alteration of gene expression described was Barbara McClintock's ex- amination of the Spni transposon in maize (McClintock 1958). It was her belief that the programmable, heritable changes in Spni expression could serve as a paradigm for gene regulation. It was subsequently discovered that maize elements undergo reversible methylation associated with changes in their activity (Banks et al. 1988; Dennis and Bret- tell 1990). Indeed, methylation of transposons (in hosts that methylate their DNA) is the most reliable single predictor of that activity. There is an increasing body of evidence that regulation of transposable elements by DNA methylation and the regula- tion of host genes are mechanistically linked. For instance, changes in methylation of TEs in maize are clearly nonran- dom. McClintock noted that Spm could cycle between active and inactive phases in heritable and programmed patterns during development (reviewed by Federoff 1989). Similarly, Martienssen et al. (1990) have observed that the Mutator system of transposons in maize is progressively methylated as the plant meristem ages. These observations lend credence to the idea that shifts in the degree of silencing of these transposable element are correlated with host-encoded shifts in global epigenetic regulatory pathways. More recently, it has been discovered that mutations that prevent paramutation (an epigenetically regulated process of gene inactivation) in maize, also reverse Mu element silencing, suggesting that the regulation of both host and parasite can be mediated by a similar suite of genes (D. R. Lisch et al., unpubl. ms.). It is impossible to say at this point, how epigenetic mech- anisms such as methylation arose. Certainly they can play different roles in different species. In Ciona intestinalis, for instance, it is active genes that are predominantly methylated and transposons that are hypomethylated (Simmen et al. 1999), and some organisms, such as Drosophila nmelanogaster have little if any methylation (Urieli-Shoval et al. 1982). However, given its prevalence and frequent association with gene silencing, and thus its potential utility, we suggest that DNA methylation almost certainly plays an important role in epigenetic regulation of host genes as well as transposons. The two perspectives are not, after all, mutually exclusive. DNA methylation in many species may have evolved as a response to repetitive DNA. However, the presence of such a flexible mechanism for reversible gene inactivation presents the host with an invaluable tool for nuanced gene expression. Further, regardless of how it arose, the massive methylation of the large fraction of the genome of organisms, such as maize and humans, almost certainly has affected larger struc- tural characteristics of these genomes. In a remarkable ex- ample of this, O'Neill et al. (1998) have shown in wallaby hybrids that large scale changes in methylation are accom-</page><page sequence="11">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 1 1 panied by gross alterations of entire chromosomes due to massive retrotransposon amplification. Interestingly, transposon systems in maize are frequently associated with suppressible mutations, which effectively link systems of epigenetic regulation with host gene expres- sion (reviewed by Girard and Freeling 1999). In these cases, expression of the mutant phenotype becomes dependent on the expression of the transposase source, and variations in transposon activity due to epigenetic regulation of the trans- poson can and do result in changes in host gene expression. As we have pointed out earlier, regulatory regions of host genes have in some cases incorporated transposon sequences, and transposon coding regions have become host genes. Thus, the blurring of the line between host gene and parasitic el- ement represents instances in which mechanisms that may have arisen to control repetitive DNA may have had a pro- found impact on the regulation of host development and evo- lution. HOST RECRUITMENT OF TRANSPOSON FUNCTIONS As we have shown, transposons can introduce a distinct spectrum of variability through insertion mutagenesis, sug- gesting that TEs can introduce selectively advantageous var- iation otherwise not easily available to the host. In these cases it is the products of TE activity that are selectively advan- tageous. However, TEs also carry with them enzymatic ma- chinery that is itself potentially useful. Any host function that involves the breakage and rejoining of DNA, for in- stance, could potentially benefit from the presence of a di- verse pool of rapidly evolving enzymes specializing in that process. This category is often not easy to identify because recruitment may occur long after the elements initially en- tered the host genome; these sequences may even have lost some of the features that distinguish them as of TE origin. Four subcategories of transposon recruitment are described and illustrated below: those providing (1) regulatory func- tions; (2) structural functions; (3) enzymatic functions; and (4) new coding sequences. Host Recruitment of Regulatory Functions The potential importance for evolution of mutations af- fecting regulation of gene expression began to be appreciated in the 1960s and 1970s (Britten and Davidson 1969, 1971). This preceded the growing understanding of the genetic basis of development in multicellular eukaryotes as a process in which genes acting early in development serve as regulators of subsequent, more regionally specialized, pathways that progressively direct cells into more highly specialized func- tions (McDonald 1990). Class I TEs, in particular, have the properties required of any mechanism postulated to be at the foundation of major developmental shifts that have occurred over evolutionary time. These properties are their ability to be completely or partial suppressed and their ability to in- crease in frequency under conditions of environmental stress (McDonald 1990). More recently there is growing appreci- ation of the dominant evolutionary role played by reshuffling of different combinations of ready-to-use regulatory elements between different genes (Frigerio et al. 1986; Xue and Noll 1996), and the alteration of expression induced by mutation of cis-regulatory elements (Xue and Noll 1996). The classical model for the evolution of genes that have undergone gene duplication implies that the only mechanism for the permanent preservation of duplicate genes is the fix- ation of rare beneficial mutations. However, a new model, the duplication degeneration complementation (DDC) model (Force et al. 1999), posits that deleterious or degenerative mutations in gene regulatory elements can increase, rather than decrease, the probability of duplicate gene preservation. The latter model incorporates the recent view that genes often have several functions, or subfunctions, that are controlled by different DNA regulatory elements (see Fig. 3). Thus the DDC model allows for the evolution of new subfunctions in the absence of new beneficial mutations in the duplicated genes themselves. As illustrated in the following examples, this changed perspective is likely to be important for fully understanding the significance and role of TEs in regulatory evolution. The reason is that TEs, like mutators in general, produce a greater proportion of mutations that are deleterious rather than beneficial to their hosts. The number of cases in which TEs have been shown to affect host gene regulation is steadily growing. MITEs in gene regulation in plants and other species. MITEs are a common feature of introns and the 5' and 3' regions flanking the coding sequences of plant genes. These elements are short (100-400 bp in length) and most do not have any coding potential. MITEs are present in high copy number (3,000-10,000) per genome and in plants have DNA target site preferences for TA or TAA. They are exemplified by the Tourist element in maize (Bureau and Wessler 1992) and the Stowaway element in Sorghum (Bureau and Wessler 1994). Similar elements have recently been found in species as diverse as Xenopus (Unsal and Morgan 1995), Zebra fish (Izsvak et al. 1999), the yellow-fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Tu 1997), Arabidopsis thaliana (Casacuberta et al. 1998), and Homo sapiens (Smit and Riggs 1996). The propensity of these elements to insert into (and, in some cases, even make up) the regulatory regions of genes in all of these species suggests an important role in host regulatory evolution. Ad- ditionally, analysis of two grass species (Avramova et al. 1998) suggested that some MITEs preferentially insert near Matrix Attachment Regions (MARs) and/or that they can serve as MARs suggesting that these elements, like the re- troelements in maize, may have a major role in partitioning the genome of their hosts. Mammalian retroposons in gene regulation. Tomilin (1999) has documented the growing number of well-estab- lished examples of mammalian retroposons that are involved in the modulation of expression of protein-coding genes tran- scribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Retroposons, such as SINES and LINES encode conserved binding sites for some important Pol II transcription factors and sequences involved in regulation of mRNA stability. One example of these functional Pol II Transcription-Modulating Elements (TMEs) (Tomilin 1999) in retroposons is the tRNA-derived rat ID retroposons (Weiner et al. 1986; Kim et al. 1994). These retroposons act as enhancers of RNA polymerase II gene transcription in cell lines that express these RNAs. Based on increasingly solid evidence, Tomilin (1999) con-</page><page sequence="12">12 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R.

Three potential fates of duplicate gene pairs with multiple regulatory regions are shown according to this model. The small boxes denote regulatory elements with unique functions, and the large boxes denote transcribed regions. Solid boxes denote intact regions of a gene, whereas open boxes denote null mutations, and triangles denote the evolution of a new function. Because the model focuses on mutations that are fixed in populations, the diagram shows the state of a single gamete. In the first two steps, one of the copies acquires null mutations in each of two regulatory regions. On the left, the next fixed mutation results in the absence of a functional protein product from the upper copy. Because this gene is now a nonfunctional pseudogene, the remaining regulatory regions associated with this copy eventually accumulate degenerative mutations. On the right, the lower copy acquires a null mutation in a regulatory region that is intact in the upper copy. Because both copies are now essential for complete gene expression, this third mutational event permanently preserves both members of the gene pair from future nonfunctionalization. The fourth regulatory region, however, may still eventually acquire a null mutation in one copy or the other. In the center, a regulatory region acquires a new function that preserves that copy. If the beneficial mutation occurs at the expense of an otherwise essential function, then the duplicate copy is preserved because it retains the original function (after Force et al. 1999). cluded that "mammalian retroposons play a significant role in the evolution of regulatory elements controlling expression of protein-coding genes crucial for the functioning of organ- isms.'" Other TE-associated regulatory functions.-Britten has used stringent criteria for the identification of strong cases of the involvement of TEs in the actual evolution of gene regulation (Britten 1996a,b, 1997). He maintains that a long term perspective is necessary in identifying and understand- ing mutations important for gene regulation. The number of cases he has identified is small, but growing. In addition to the plant MITE examples discussed above, he includes cases involving the association of a retrovirus-related element with androgen regulation of the sex-limited protein (Slp) gene in mice (Stavenhagen and Robins 1988) and inverted repeats in the CyllIa actin gene of sea urchins (Anderson et al. 1994). In plants, computer-assisted database searches using plant copia-like retroelements as query sequences revealed that an- cient, degenerate retrotransposon insertions are found in close proximity to 21 previously sequenced plant genes. The data suggest that these elements may be involved in gene dupli- cation and the regulation of gene expression (White et al. 1994). A number of additional examples of the effects of TEs on gene regulation are reviewed by Kidwell and Lisch (1997). Of particular interest is an example involving the Tamn3 el- ement in Antirrhinurn (Lister et al. 1993). A series of TE- associated mutations exemplifies the potential for TE-me- diated "rewiring" of regulatory networks, in this case by bringing new regulatory sequences in proximity to exonic sequences via an inversion, followed by an imprecise exci- sion event. A recent example of a TE becoming an integral part of the regulation of a host gene is provided by the apli- poprotein (a) gene in humans (Yang et al. 1998). An enhancer of this gene, located 20 kilobases upstream of the start of transcription, is located entirely within a LINE element. Differential developmental and tissue-specific expression. Insertion mutations appear to provide a ready mechanism for the fast evolution of complex patterns of developmental reg- ulation and tissue specific expression. A clear example of TE-induced differential expression of a gene product is pro- vided by the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT1) locus in Drosophila (Brodbeck et al. 1998). In insects, aaNAT1 has been implicated in sclerotinization, inactivation of certain neurotransmitters and catalysis of a rate-limiting step in melatonin formation. In D. melanogaster, two alleles of this locus have been studied in detail. The allele that en- codes the more abundant isoform has two TEs, MDG412 and blastopia, that together constitute 12 kb, inserted downstream of the first exon. This isomer is first expressed in embryo- genesis and continues to be detectable throughout develop- ment and in the adult brain. In contrast, the less abundant isoform, encoded by the allele lacking the TE insert, appears first during the late pupal stage of development.</page><page sequence="13">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 13 Host Recruitment of Structural Functions Telomeres. Another fundamental problem facing all eu- karyotes is that presented by the replication of linear chro- mosomes. Because DNA polymerase is insufficient to rep- licate the very ends of these chromosomes, additional spe- cialized enzymatic machinery is necessary to ensure that en- tire linear chromosomes are replicated successfully. In most eukaryotes the key enzyme involved is telomerase. This en- zyme uses short RNA molecules and a reverse transcriptase function to add residues that would otherwise be lost during replication. As it is a fundamentally important survival mechanism having to do with an ancient problem faced by eukaryotes, one would expect the use of some form of telomerase to be extremely well conserved, as it is in most species examined. However, insects of the order Diptera, which includes Dro- sophila melanogaster, turned out to have a remarkable sur- prise in store. Rather than telomerase, Drosophila uses two families of retrotransposons, Het-A and TART, to solve the same basic problem (Levis et al. 1993; Sheen and Levis 1994). At the conclusion of each round of DNA replication, one or more of these elements transposes from source sites a distance from the telomere to the termini of each replicated chromosome. Both these elements are retrotransposons of the non-LTR type, an ancient and widely distributed class of mobile elements (Flavell 1995). At the telomeres there are a series of elements that have transposed to the end of the chromosome and then subsequently been "eaten away" be- fore the addition of the next transposon. The overall length of chromosomes is kept relatively constant by the continual addition of new transposon sequences. Interestingly, another insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori, has a non-LTR retroelement that also specifically targets telo- meres (Takahashi et al. 1997). In this species, however, rather than replacing telomerase function, the element transposes into a more typical telomeric sequence, suggesting that in this case the TE is simply targeting a "safe haven" for in- sertion, rather than acting as a surrogate telomerase. Simi- larly, in the green algae Chlorella vulgaris, a non-LTR re- trotransposon, Zepp, accumulates in nested clusters imme- diately behind the telomeric repeats (Higashiyama et al. 1997). These observations suggest that some non-LTR re- troelements in Diptera may have evolved from parasitic ex- ploitation of transcriptionally silent regions in the telomeres to providing a vital role in host telomere maintenance. As it turns out, the situation is even more complex. Tel- omerase itself may have evolved from an originally selfish genetic element. The RT domain of telomerase is functionally and structurally similar to that found in a wide range of mobile genetic elements (Eickbush 1994; Nakamura et al. 1997). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that telomerase rep- resents a deep branch in the evolution of reverse transcrip- tases, strongly suggesting a common origin with TEs (Eick- bush 1997; Nakamura et al. 1997). Because of the wide di- vergences between sequences and the uncertainty of any mo- lecular clock based on hypermutable mobile elements, the exact phylogeny of RT sequences is difficult to determine (Nakamura and Cech 1998). However, based on such an anal- ysis, Eickbush (1997) has proposed that the RT function of telomerase was recruited from an originally parasitic element. An alternative explanation is that telomerase RT is phylo- genetically more basal, and that non-LTR elements arose as parasitic "escaped" telomerase sequences (Eickbush 1994, 1997). In either event, it is clear that telomerase and reverse transcriptase-based mobile elements represent two ends of a dynamic spectrum of possible relationships between host and parasite. The essential role of TART and Het-A elements in Drosophila and the more parasitic relationship between telo- mere-targeting retroposons and other hosts suggests that a single class of element (non-LTR elements) can occupy a range of positions within that spectrum. In each of the cases outlined above, transposable elements may have had profound effects on the mode and perhaps even the direction of host evolution. Certainly, vivipary and V(D)J recombination represent fundamental turning points in ver- tebrate evolution, and telomere maintenance is a problem that all eukaryotes face. In this case, and in most others perhaps, alternative pathways were available. Yeast, for instance, can use a recombination based pathway to maintain its chro- mosome ends in the absence of telomerase (Le et al. 1999; Lundblad and Blackburn 1993). However, it is clear that in many cases the best available mechanism was encoded by previously selfish genetic elements. Genome reorganization in ciliated protozoa. The pro- grammed somatic excision of interstitial segments of DNA that occurs as part of the regular life cycle of ciliated protozoa provides a fascinating example of the cooption of TEs for a host function. Each organism contains both a micronucleus and a macronucleus. The micronucleus consists of conven- tional eukaryotic chromosomes and can be viewed as the "germline" nucleus (Klobutcher and Herrick 1995). It is transcriptionally inactive during vegetative propagation, but is active during sexual reproduction. The genome of the mac- ronucleus consists of a subset of the micronucleus DNA which is extensively rearranged by chromosome fragmen- tation, de novo telomere synthesis and DNA amplification. During the reorganization process, large numbers of inter- stitial segments of DNA (internal eliminated sequences; IES) are exactly excised from the somatic nucleus through DNA breaking, rejoining, and splicing. There is evidence that TEs are a major component of the highly variable structures of IESs (Klobutcher and Herrick 1995; Seegmiller et al. 1996; Seegmiller and Herrick 1998). It has been proposed (Klo- butcher and Herrick 1997) that transposon invasions have generated the ciliate DNA excision phenomena. Further, it has been suggested that short IESs are ancient transposon IESs that have shrunk by loss of internal sequences unnec- essary for host developmental excision. A series of evolu- tionary steps is envisaged (Klobutcher and Herrick 1997). This includes four phases: invasion, bloom, abdicate, and fade (IBAF) (see Fig. 4). Of particular interest in the present context is the change occurring during the "abdicate" phase in which a transposon-encoded excisase comes under the con- trol of a host promoter. Note also the similarities of the IBAF phases with those of a TE life cycle (Fig. 1). Centromeres and heterochromatin. Centromeres are the regions of chromosomes devoted to segregation of sister and homologous chromosomes during cell division.

In the abdicate step, a part of a transposon encoding excisase functions is represented as coming under the control of a strong host promoter (from Klobutcher and Herrick 1997). chromatic in character. They are essentially defined by their late replication in S phase and their function in storing spe- cific DNA-binding proteins in cell division (Csink and Hen- ikoff 1998). In a number of species they are made up largely of transposons and simple repeated sequences. In the yeast Neurospora crassa, for example, sequenced portions of the centromere are composed entirely of degenerate transposons, one of which, Tcen, is located exclusively in the centromere (Cambareri et al. 1998). Similarly, a centromere of D. me- lanogaster was observed to be primarily made up of satellite sequences and single intact transposable elements (Sun et al. 1997). These sequences were neither unique to the centro- mere, nor were they present in all centromeres of D. melan- ogaster, supporting the view that it is the general structural characteristics of these centromeres that are important, rather than specific sequences. In maize, sequenced centromeric regions were also rich in both simple repeat and TE sequences, some of which, like Tcen, were localized exclusively to centromeres (Ananiev et al. 1998). Interestingly, heterochromatic chromosomal knobs in maize, which are also composed of simple repeats inter- spersed with transposable elements, can, in some circum- stances, act as neocentromeres (Yu et al. 1997). These neo- centromeres exhibit meiotic drive, meaning they are over represented in the progeny (Dawe and Cande 1996), a sus- piciously "selfish" behavior. Any TE contribution to cen- tromeric function can, in some instances, result in a change in the frequency of TEs in a population. The SGM family of TEs in Drosophila guanche provides an interesting example of the cooption of a formerly active TE to form a major satellite DNA (Miller et al. 2000). The SGM family of TEs has structural and functional similarities to MITES. SGM elements were active in the common an- cestor of the closely-related species Drosophila subobscura, Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila guanche in the Dro- sophila obscure species group. They gave rise to the A-type promoter of the P-element neogene cluster (Miller et al. 2000, see also section below). SGM elements were active in D. subobscura and D. madeirensis only 1-2 MYA. However, in D. guanche they gave rise to a major satellite DNA that now occupies approximately 10% of the genome and is found mainly in the centric heterochromatin. Other examples of the cooption of TEs to form centromeric satellite DNA are pro- vide by mammals generally (Kipling and Warburton 1997), Cetaceans (Kapitonov et al. 1998), and other Drosophilids (Zelentsova et al. 1986; Heikkinen et al. 1995). Recent work in both yeast and mammals suggest that trans- posons may play an even more active role in centromeric function than was previously thought. In mammals, centro- meric repeat binding proteins bind repetitive motifs within centromeric regions. One of these proteins, CENP-B, is clear- ly related to the pogo TE of Drosophila, and the Tigger trans- poson in humans (Earnshaw et al. 1987). Homologues of CENP-B are found in species as diverse as fission yeast (Lee et al. 1997) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Lin et al. 1999). Al- though sequences similar to those bound by CENP-B in hu- mans are found in centromeric regions of a number of or- ganisms, they are apparently much less widespread than CENP-B itself (Canapa et al. 2000; Haaf et al. 1995; Heslop- Harrison et al. 1999; Nonomura and Kurata 1999). Interest- ingly, the Tigger terminal inverted repeat, which is presum- ably interacting with the transposase, contains a close match to the region bound by CENP-B. Thus, it appears that at least one function of the Tigger transposon, i.e., the binding of a specific DNA sequence, has been retained by CENP-B. In some genetic backgrounds, mice that are mutant for the</page><page sequence="15">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 15 Cenp-b locus show significant reduction in fertility, perhaps due to lesions in uterine remodeling, a process which requires extensive mitotic division (Fowler et al. 2000). The observed dependence on genetic background in mice may be related to redundancy of function. In support of this hypothesis, in fission yeast, when two redundant homologues of CENP-B were mutated the resulting strains were severely compro- mised in growth rate and morphology, and they exhibited marked chromosome missegregation (Baum and Clarke 2000). These data suggest that CENP-B, which is clearly related to an ancient and widespread family of TEs, can play an important role in host chromosome segregation. Interestingly, at least two other genes that are clearly re- lated to the Pogo superfamily of transposases appear to have functional roles in their hosts. The jerkey gene causes pro- nounced neurological problems when mutant in mice (Toth et al. 1995), and another relative of Pogo, the rag3 gene in yeast, is involved in Pyruvate decarboxylase synthesis (Prior et al. 1996). This phylogenetic intermixing, in which a series of apparently functional host genes are related to a series of transposons, suggests that this class of element may be par- ticularly likely to be "domesticated" (Miller et al. 1997) for a variety of roles. Genomic interspersion patterns. The kinds and numbers of transposable elements can vary radically in different spe- cies. This becomes quite apparent when comparing TE com- pliments in D. melanogaster and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. More than thirty families of transposable el- ements have recently been found in A. aegypti (Z. Tu, pers. comm.). These include a number of families of highly re- petitive MITEs (Tu 1997), non-LTR retrotransposons (Tu et al. 1998), and a family of SINEs (Tu 1999). The three families of LTR-retrotransposons in A. aegypti are low in copy number (Warren et al. 1997; Z. Tu, unpubl. data). Many of these TEs tend to be associated with other families of TEs, which is one of the reasons why so many families of TEs have been discovered in a relatively short period of time. In addition, some of the TEs, especially the MITEs, tend to be associated with genes in A. aegypti. The genome of A. aegypti is ap- proximately 800 Mb, five times larger than that of its dipteran relative, D. melanogaster. In addition, the A. aegypti genome is organized in a "short period interspersion pattern" while the D. melanogaster genome is organized in a "long period interspersion pattern". It is possible that the presence of high- ly repetitive MITEs, SINEs, and non-LTR retrotransposons may have contributed to the pattern of short period inter- spersion in A. aegypti. Host Recruitment of Enzymatic Functions Repair functions. In addition to the healing of chromo- some ends in Drosophila, described above, retrotransposon- encoded RT can be responsible for the repair of double-strand chromosome breaks (DSBs) in Saccharomnyces cerevisiae (Moore and Haber 1996; Teng et al. 1996). Note that in this case, as in others described here, coadaptation may have grown out of parasitic element behavior; DSBs may simply represent an especially good target for efficient TE insertion and, in turn, these insertions may, in some instances, also be the most efficient repair pathway available to the host. The net effect, rapid insertional repair of breaks, is expected to benefit both host and TE. The ability to heal breaks, either in the middle, or at the ends of chromosomes may represent an evolutionary conserved role for retrotransposons (Labra- dor and Corces 1997). The widespread distribution of re- troelements in centromeric heterochromatin may also be rel- evant in this regard. Such elements may play a role in healing the breaks that this type of chromatin is prone to because of its late replicating nature (Labrador and Corces 1997). Perhaps the most remarkable example of host recruitment involves the vertebrate immune system. Pathogens, such as viruses, are capable of rapid evolutionary change (Fitch 1996). This capacity for extreme plasticity over short periods of time presents large, slowly evolving organisms with a profound problem. They must match the flexibility of their pathogens with a mechanism capable of producing the same degree of variability within the somatic cells of a single in- dividual. Recent work on the V(D)J recombination system in vertebrates provides a clue as to how such a system may have evolved. Diversity in the immune system of vertebrates is generated in lymphocytes. In many vertebrates, antibodies and T cell receptors (immunoglobins that bind directly to antigens) are produced in somatic cells via a process of chromosome break- age and rejoining (Tonegawa 1983). This process joins to- gether several segments of DNA that together make up se- quences that encode immunoglobins. Because the joining is imprecise and may involve any one of several possible sets of sequences, this process results in a remarkably diverse set of distinct immunoglobin molecules. Because it is repeated in the somatic lymphocytes of each individual, it is possible for each individual to carry with it a mechanism for gener- ating the same degree of variability as is present among all potential pathogens. As it turns out, transposons appear to have provided vertebrates with the enzymatic functions nec- essary to achieve this degree of somatic hypermutability. V(D)J recombination requires the activity of two enzymes, RAGI and RAG2 (Oettinger et al. 1990; McBlane et al. 1995). These enzymes are encoded by two genes, rag] and rag2, that are tightly linked to each other (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993; Oettinger et al. 1990). During the course of investigating the activity of RAG1 and RAG2 it became ap- parent that the mechanism by which V(D)J recombination is achieved is strikingly similar to that by which transposons move (reviewed by Lewis and Wu 1997). As the mechanism was so similar, it was proposed that the two may have a common evolutionary origin (Spanopoulou et al. 1996). More recent work (Agrawal et al. 1998; Hiom et al. 1998), has demonstrated that RAGI and RAG2 can, under certain cir- cumstances, catalyze both inter- and intramolecular trans- position in vitro, lending credence to the theory that the orig- inal function of these two enzymes was to catalyze trans- position. Together, these data provide strong evidence that the system for V(D)J recombination arose from an ancestral transposition pathway that was modified to eliminate rein- sertion of intervening transposon sequences (Fig. 5). The generation of immunological diversity through V(D)J recombination is a key achievement of the vertebrate lineage. It is difficult to imagine the success of this lineage in the absence of a means by which pathogens could be successfully</page><page sequence="16">16 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R.

The figure depicts the se- quential addition of recombination signals into a receptor gene pro- genitor via transposition of the "rag" transposon or a nonauton- omous derivative. The result of this subdivision of the ancestral host gene is hypothesized to result in the V, D, and J gene segments. Restoration of gene function through somatic excision of the trans- posons would be selectively favored, as would be the continued presence of the transposase source. Inaccuracies in the excision products (e.g., footprints) would contribute to the variability of the host gene. Subsequent gene duplication would contribute additional variation to the system (from Agrawal et al. 1998). fought off. As it turns out, transposons almost certainly pro- vided one of the mechanisms by which this could be achieved. The collaboration between host and parasite in this case is so intimate that they no longer can be viewed as separate entities. The capacity to break and recombine DNA, a key feature of transposon biology, appears to have been suc- cessfully coopted by the host, and the result has had a pro- found impact on the evolution of vertebrates. Viral resistance. There is good evidence that the "do- mestication" of some components of endogenous RT-based retroviruses has played a role in the evolution of resistance to viral infections. Reverse transcriptase-based viruses are ubiquitous, diverse, and occasionally, highly pathogenic. Thus, mechanisms to reduce their virulence are selectively advantageous. One of the more interesting of these mecha- nisms involves the recruitment of viral protein products by the host as a defense against exogenous viral attack. The Fv1 locus in mice was identified originally as a viral resistance gene (Rowe and Sato 1973). Mice carrying specific alleles of this gene confer resistance to infection by certain strains of murine leukemia virus. When cloned, the gene was identified as a homolog of the Gag-encoding gene of a newly described class of HERV-L-related mouse endogenous ret- roviruses (Benit et al. 1997; Best et al. 1996). The Fvl-gene product acts on the murine leukemia virus at a stage after entry into the cell, but before integration into the host genome (Pryciak and Varmus 1992). Genetic evidence suggests that it interacts with a component of the viral preintegration com- plex (Bowerman et al. 1989). The host Fvi gene appears to have been recruited from an endogenous or exogenous retrovirus. Thus, what had been a purely selfish sequence of DNA was modified for the purpose of defense against infection. Interestingly, part of that mod- ification probably involved the insertion of additional TEs, as the polyadenylation signal in all Fv-i alleles examined is within insertion elements (Best et al. 1996). Other viral re- sistance genes, such as Fv-4 (Kozak et al. 1984; Ikeda and Sugimura 1989; Nihrane et al. 1997), which encodes a ho- molog of a viral env gene, have also proved to be portions of viral genomes, suggesting that viral recruitment may be a common way to augment host defenses. Vivipary. Viral recruitment may have played an important role in the evolution of vivipary as well. Viviparous organ- isms with active immune systems face a fundamental prob- lem: the developing embryo represents a "foreign" organism within its mother. If unprotected, it would be subject to im- munological attack by the maternal immune system. Al- though it is as yet unknown exactly how this is achieved, there are strong indications that endogenous retroviral se- quences are involved. In all mammals examined to date, there are at least a few endogenous retroelements that are complete and active (Villarreal 1997). These elements are often well conserved and widespread within a given host species (Jurka et al. 1995; Singer et al. 1993), and are expressed at high levels in specific tissues. A highly conserved portion of the env gene of both endogenous and exogenous retroelements has been shown to be immunosuppressive (Denner 1998). Further, the tissues in which it is expressed, such as the placenta, are precisely those that one would expect if the purpose of the expression were to protect the embryo from attack (Huang and Calarco 1981; Larsson et al. 1994; Ven- ables et al. 1995). Thus, it has been proposed that some endogenous retroelements in mammals have been recruited in order to make vivipary possible (Venables et al. 1995; Villarreal 1997). If true, this would be an excellent example of the host making use of a function, immunosuppression, that originally evolved in viruses for supremely selfish rea- sons. Certainly, immunosuppression in mammals could have evolved from existing host genes, but the presence of a di- verse and efficient system, that was preexisting in the viral genome, apparently made that unnecessary. An interesting analog for this putative immunosuppressive function in mammals exists in some endoparasatoid wasp</page><page sequence="17">TRANSPOSONS AND GENOME EVOLUTION 17 species (reviewed by Beckage 1998). In this case, wasp eggs are deposited in the larval host species along with large amounts of wasp-encoded DNA polydnavirus. The polyd- navirus is an endogenous component of the wasp genome that is inactive in the wasp, but transcriptionally active in the larval host. The viral products act to prevent the normal immunological response of the larvae, thus allowing devel- opment of the parasitoid. Thus, the polydnavirus can be seen as an essential component of the wasp reproductive system. Recombination template. The human major histocompat- ibility (MHC) region provides an excellent example of the range of TE-induced changes that have contributed to host evolution over a long period of time. In particular, this region provides a good example of the effects of retroelements on genomic plasticity of the host in an area in which recombi- nation is particularly valuable for generating diversity. In addition to more than 200 genes, densely clustered areas of retroelements have been identified in the MHC region (An- dersson et al. 1998). The predominant classes are SINEs, LINEs, and HERVs (human endogenous retroviruses). The central region of the MHC contains two duplicated segments, peri-B (53 kb) and peri-C (48 kb) that are the result of a gene duplication that occurred prior to the divergence of the New World primate/human lineage split (Kulski et al. 1997). The identification of numerous fragmented and intact retroele- ments (LI, Alu, LTR, and THE sequences) flanking two genes located in a region flanked by (HLA)-B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) suggested that these retroelements are involved in the duplication process (Gaudieri et al. 1997). Analysis of the retroelements contained within the HLA-B and HLA-C genes that reside within the duplicated segments has shown the utility of retroelements, such as Alu repeats in the dating of the duplication to 44-81 MYA (Kulski et al. 1997). This analysis has also pointed out the major role played by the mobility of these elements in the mutation and diversification of the HLA-B and HLA-C genes following duplication. Molecular domestication. The stationary P element-re- lated gene clusters of Drosophila guanche, D. madeirensis, and D. subobscura provide an interesting example of molec- ular domestication (Miller et al. 1992, 1997). Each cluster unit consists of a cis-regulating section composed of different insertion sequences followed by the first three exons of a P element that encodes a 66 kDa "repressor-like" protein. In contrast to this normal repressor function, these stationary P element repeats appear to have evolved the function of tran- scription factors (Miller et al. 1995). Remarkably, the D. guanche P-protein produces an enhancer-like effect, rather than repressing canonical P element activity in transgenic D. melanogaster (W. Miller, pers. comm.). The insertion se- quence which gave rise to the de novo A-type promoter of this P-gene cluster has recently been identified (Miller et al. 2000). This insertion belongs to a new MITE-like TE family, designated SGM, that is related to poorly characterized IS elements of other obscura group species. Evidence that molecular domestication of a TE family may recur in a host lineage is provided by a truncated immobile P sequence cloned from Drosophila tscasi, a species of the Drosophila montium subgroup (Nouaud and Anxolabehere 1997). This truncated element produces a polyadenylated RNA that also has a coding capacity for a 66-kDa "repressor- like" protein. This domestication event has led to the evo- lution of a new promoter and a new intron (Nouaud et al. 1999). Although the immobile obscure and montium P se- quences were derived from the same ancestral mobile P el- ement family, the structures of the flanking regions of these sequences indicates that they were produced by two com- pletely independent evolutionary events. It has been argued (Miller et al. 1999) that these examples of domestication represent more than just isolated examples of an infrequent process. Rather, the adaptive integration of a short piece of autonomous DNA into a complex regulatory network that occurs in molecular domestication might be con- sidered to represent an evolutionary process that has been common in the evolution of increasingly complex forms of life. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Much has been made about the distinction between "self- ish" and "altruistic" DNA. Transposable element evolution, in all of its rich complexity, reveals the artificiality of this distinction. Instead of maintaining an unchanging relation- ship with hosts, transposons occupy a range of positions with- in a spectrum of relationships, ranging from extreme para- sitism (e.g., the world-wide invasion of P elements in D. melanogaster) to unalloyed mutualism (e.g., the cooption of RAGl/RAG2 in the evolution of V(D)J recombination in vertebrates). Transposable element evolution is primarily selfish (es- pecially during the early stages of population invasion) in the sense that it is largely driven by selection in favor of competence to increase copy number. It is constrained, how- ever, by selection against the negative effects of transposi- tion, such as disruption of gene function, which has lead to a complex array of mechanisms to modulate the effects of TE activity. Further, the rapid ebb and flow of transposable elements within host genomes and the rapid pace of evolution that is possible within large populations of transposable el- ements in the absence of selection at the level of the host has resulted in the evolution of traits that, in the end, can prove quite beneficial to the host. The position at which any given mobile element finds itself in the spectrum between pure parasite and essential com- ponent of the host genome depends both on the selective forces acting upon it at a given time in a given species and on a variety of chance factors. As selection can operate both at the level of the host and at the level of the gene simul- taneously and the balance between these selective forces can vary with time and situation, characterization of mobile el- ements as selfish or beneficial in any global sense is not very meaningful. It is not that TEs act as agents of evolutionary change in spite of their selfishness, nor that they have necessarily evolved in any proximal way to serve their hosts by increas- ing their "evolvability." Rather, selection on TEs at the level of the gene has resulted in the evolution of a remarkably facile "machine" for the generation of a sophisticated range of molecular tools, some of which turn out to be selectively advantageous to the host. Selection at the level of the gene can be particularly beneficial to the host because evolution</page><page sequence="18">18 M. G. KIDWELL AND D. R. LISCH at that level is not constrained by demands at every step for a trait to be selectively advantageous to the host. In this sense, TEs function as agents of evolutionary change, not in spite of their selfish characteristics, but because of them. Selection at the level of the gene on a diverse array of TEs provides a vast pool of rapidly evolving enzymatic and regulatory functions, all of which are potentially available to the host. This process is illustrated quite clearly in the evolution of V(D)J recombination in vertebrates. In this case, presumably, the capability to splice and reshuffle DNA efficiently was developed by a putative transposon as a means of increasing its copy number. Long after that capability had been devel- oped and refined it took on a role in the generation of im- munological diversity. The competence to generate that di- versity arose only because many of the early stages in its evolution were dominated by selection at the level of the gene. In a similar way, the Fv-1 locus in mice evolved as a viral coat protein gene, but many of the properties that made it useful to viruses also made it effective in preventing viral infection. The host did not need to evolve a response de novo because it already had endogenous sequences available that had previously evolved the potential to provide that response. Who are we and who are they, who is host, and' who is parasite can be seen as a function of how selection is oper- ating at any given time, and, because selection can operate at multiple levels simultaneously, these distinctions can be- come meaningless in specific cases. A host gene that func- tions in the repair of double-stranded gaps produced by a P element excision is a component of a selectively advanta- geous system of DNA repair, but it is also a component of a system to amplify P element copy number. A deletion de- rivative of a P element that suppresses P element activity is a selfish molecular parasite of autonomous P elements, but it is also a component of a system that limits P element amplification. Methyl transferase activity can act to modulate TE and viral activity, but it may also act to regulate host gene transcription during development. In each of these cases the "function" of the mechanism involved depends on the nature of the selective forces operating on a particular lin- eage. From a broad perspective, TEs are increasingly being viewed as important players in the ability of genomes to enhance their own evolution and as a major source of tools for generating the diversity to respond successfully to chang- es in environment. The emergence of such tools has been termed second order selection (Arber 1991, 2000). The very properties that lead some to label TEs as "junk DNA" may have in fact provided genomes with a plasticity otherwise unavailable to them. Indeed, rather than resulting from se- lection, many of these properties may be the outcome of constructive neutral evolution (Stoltzfus 1999). Given the opportunistic nature of evolution and recent ev- idence that morphological change is primarily a result of changes in regulatory networks, it would be surprising indeed if a ready-made tool-kit for the generation of diversity was not periodically exploited by the host species. We argue that the dynamic interplay of selection on transposable elements at various levels provides genomes with a broad and flexible capacity to evolve.
