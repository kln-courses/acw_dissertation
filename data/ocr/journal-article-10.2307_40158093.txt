Galli- mard. 2002. 171 pages. â‚¬13.50 isbn 2-07- 076510-5 Five years ago, Eugene Guiilevic left us - his considerable sum of published work and the one hundred and thirty poems collected in Quotidiennes and edited here for the first time, thanks to the combined efforts of Lucie Guiilevic- Albertini and Bernard Joseph Samain. The poems, composed over a two-year pe- riod up until the end of 1996, echo many of the preoccupations of earlier volumes such as Requis or Le Chant (see WLT 71:3, p. ^yj) or Possibles futurs, though never dip into either the modes of collections such as Trente et un sonnets or Gagner, or the potentially paralyz- ing obsessions of the very first work, where the struggle with the "monstrous" can be fiercely disquieting. Certainly, Guiilevic can articulate a sense of distance and separation, yet gratitude dominates and implies deeper connection. Certainly, there can be staged a dance of rationalizations before the phenom- ena of the world, puzzlement and disbelief vying with a strange mystical instinct. All Guillevic's work has posited a meaning at the heart of the interpenetration of conscience and choses, yet it is a meaning he continues, even here, to query and tussle with, nervous still about its anthropomorphic grounding. Ever caught, in consequence, between a clinging materialism and the initiatory mystery of thought - and, indeed, emotion - knowledge and love (of the other and of self) roll about in a mind at once hesitant, doubting, interroga- tive, and desirous of rejoicing, of surrender to impulse and hope, of a giving of the self to an intuited "original" ontological depth. If, then, Guillevic's sense of a "love / That will engulf you / In the infiniteness / Of what calls out to us" continues to maintain it- self, if that "Something / That bears you up, / . . . / In which is revealed / An irrefutable calling forth" - he is addressing here an aca- cia bush - retains its grip over a poetic imag- ination straining to peer through the visible into what Elytis termed, in his 1979 Nobel ac- ceptance speech, the "metaphysical signifi- cance" of observable phenomena, Guiilevic shows in Quotidiennes that frank reluctance, and no doubt incapacity, to credit, absolutely, the very instincts and emotional orientation that yet make his work compelling, lastingly memorable. In this, he remains a man of his century despite the fact that his profound and felt knowing of love would orient him rather toward "possible futures," "future op- tions" - for Quotidiennes is finally, a testa- ment of vision and swirling feasibility.
