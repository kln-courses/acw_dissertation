<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS. Principium Sapientiae: the Origins oj Greek Philosophical Thought. By F. M. Cornford. Cambridge University Press. 1952. 270 pp. 25s. net. Principium Sapientiae is a wide-ranging study in the origins of Greek philosophy. Published posthumously, it contains the final reflections of the late Professor Cornford on those problems to which he so continuously devoted the powers of his penetrating and sympathetic mind. The quality of Ionian science, the origins of empiricism, Shamanism, poetry and philosophy, ritual and cosmology, oriental influences on Hesiod, all these themes, and many more, are handled in a novel and illuminating fashion. Scholars familiar with Thucydides Mythistoricus or From Religion to Philosophy will recognise the same deft and artistic methods of presentation by which our author woos his readers' intellectual assent by first captivating their aesthetic appreciation. Like his seers and shamans Cornford was not unskilled in the art of weaving spells. This his last work contains many flashes of the old brilliance. Though it is in parts rather repetitive, and at the end somewhat fragmentary, it can fairly claim to provide a new approach to the obscure matrix of tradition, belief, ritual and myth from which the great systems of Greek philosophical thought took their rise. In Part I, the more finished and coherent section, Cornford argues that the functions of poet, prophet and sage were originally united in the same person, a remote prototype of the shamans still to be found in central Asia. This gifted individual was the fount and focus of a knowledge not revealed to ordinary mortals. The great pre-Socratic philosophers were in the direct line of this tradition, and this explains, amongst other things, the poetry of Parmenides and Empedocles, and the oracular style of Heraclitus. Philosophy did not suddenly invade a field which had been reserved for poets and prophets. The first philosophers addressed themselves in a more rationalistic spirit to the same task which had occupied the didactic poets from the mythical Orpheus to the historical Epimenides. They tried to present a coherent picture of the origin and functioning of the world, a picture which, because of its breadth and complexity, could not be constructed solely from the data of everyday experience. The philosophical 'intuition' required for such a task was not different in kind from the 'inspiration' that Hesiod, for example, derived from the Muses who bade him sing of 'things past and things to come'. The philosopher was therefore generically akin to other 'sages', and Plato was right to compare</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS. 93 the 'divine madness' of the philosopher with the 'madness' of the prophet inspired by Apollo and the poet inspired by the Muses. A quarrel did develop between the philosopher and the poet, but it was a quarrel between brothers not strangers. The philosopher entered into competition with the poets as an expositor of the 'nature of things', objecting in particular to anthropomorphic conceptions of the gods and mythical accounts of their exploits. But in penetrating behind the veil of myth to establish a more refined concept of the divine the philosopher relied no less than the poet on his 'prophetic soul'. This thesis Cornford embroiders with a wealth of illustration, and in the development of his theme he throws new light on many familiar passages in Greek literature. In Plato especially he finds congenial material, and the more poetic passages from the Phwedo, Symposium and Phaedrus gain dramatically in significance when expounded in organic relation with the whole nexus of his thought. Part 2 is not so satisfying; the threads are looser, the pattern more obscure. The core of the argument consists of an analysis of the pattern of Ionian cosmology by which Cornford seeks to prove its similarity with the theogonies of the poets. Of the Ionian philosophers, Anaximander receives the most detailed treatment, of the poets, Hesiod. The cosmological pattern is succinctly stated in the well-known utterance of the Melanippe of Euripides : " Heaven and Earth were once one form and when they had separated apart from one another they gave birth to all things and brought them to light ..." Admittedly Hesiod begins his cosmogony with Chaos, but Chaos, the 'yawning gap' between heaven and earth, implies the previous unity of these primal beings which were later 'separated from each other'. Similarly in Anaximander the 'sphere of flame' which at first enwrapped the solid earth is torn off into rings to form the heavenly bodies. Cornford points out that Hesiod stands on the borderline between poetry and philosophy; in parts of his poem the veil of myth wears very thin. But once the world order has been established his tone changes, and we are plunged back into the world of myth, and savage barbaric myth at that. Anaximander, disregarding the crudities of the tales of Cronos and Zeus, takes over the cosmological framework in which Hesiod had worked, strips it of its last vestiges of mythical imagery, and "speaks in abstract terms of the 'separating out of opposites' followed by their interaction and recombination" (p. 200). Cornford claims that in the perspective of an evolution from ritual to myth and from myth to developed poetic cosmology, the Ionian system "for</page><page sequence="3">94 REVIEWS. all its appearance of complete rationalism is not a free construction of the intellect reasoning from direct observation of the existing world" (p. 201). Such is the main substance of Part 2. More speculative, but very interesting, is the attempt to show that the episodes in Hesiod's story of Zeus are the "scattered debris of a single Creation myth, and, further, that the myth itself is a reflexion of New Year ritual" (p. 215). The pursuit of this thesis takes our author deep into the labyrinths of Babylonian and Canaanite myth and ritual. As Professor E. R. Dodds points out, (p. 249, n. 1), Cornford's suggestion of an affinity between Hesiod and Babylonian myth has been corroborated by the recently discovered fragments of the Epic of Kumarbi, a Hurrian poem which the Hittites appropriated, and, seemingly, trans mitted to the Aegean world through the trading city of Ugarit. In place of the concluding chapter which Cornford did not live to write, Professor Guthrie has appended a useful summary, based on manuscript material, of the author's views on the rise and decline of anthropomorphic religious beliefs. On this difficult question Cornford appears to have held somewhat unorthodox views in that he rejected the common theory that primitive man created his gods by 'animistic' interpretation of natural forces. His positive theory is, in the reviewer's opinion, cpen to objection in certain respects, but it is so bound up with the detailed discussions of earlier chapters that a colourless precis would be misleading if not meaningless. Enough has been said to show that this is an important book which will be read with profit by the mythologist as well as by the historian of philosophy. Possibly its main significance will be found to lie in the details rather than in the conclusons, but that would be in keeping with the writer's approach which tended to be poetical rather than metaphysical. However, in the tangled undergrowth of myth and ritual, intuition is often of more service than logic, and, as Professor Guthrie has aptly remarked, Cornford was "in his chosen field, the history of Greek philosophy, a better historian because he was a poet".
