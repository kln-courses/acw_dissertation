<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEFINITION OF RELIGION: A PROPOS OF MR. W. K. WRIGHT'S DEFINITION In a paper entitled, "A Psychological Definition of Religion," published in the July number of this Journal, I find the definition that I have offered of religion so incompletely stated as to convey a substan- tially wrong impression. I am reported as defining religion "a belief in a psychic, superhuman power." That religion is adequately defined as a belief in any one, or several particular objects, is one of the opinions against which I have long contended. What I have said is that "Religion is the mode of behavior in the struggle for life in which use is made of powers characterized here as psychic, superhuman, and usually personal. In its objective manifestations, religion appears as attitudes, rites, creeds, and institutions; in its subjective expression, it consists of im- pulses, desires, purposes, feelings, emotions, and ideas connected with the religious actions and institutions. According to this biological view the necessary and natural spring of religious and non-religious life alike is the 'procreant urge' in all or some of its multiform appearances. The current terms 'religious feelings,' 'religious desires,' 'religious purpose,' are deceptive, if they are intended to designate specific affective experiences, or distinctive desires and purposes. It is the belief in several kinds of powers which has made possible the differentiation of types of behavior and in particular the division into secular and religious life. The objective existence of personal divinities or equivalent psychic powers is an assumption necessary to religion; but the mere</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL NOTES 643 belief in their existence is quite insufficient to account for the important place it has occupied and still occupies among the factors of human development." To the first part of Mr. Wright's definition, I would make no other change than the addition of the word "increase." It would then read, religion is "the endeavor to secure the conservation and increase of socially recognized values." Thus stated and considered as only a part of the definition, the affirmation seems to me unexceptionable. I criticize Professors King and Ames because they substitute "highest values" for "values," and chiefly because that is for them the whole of the definition. The establishment of and the endeavor to preserve values are of the essence of life itself; they are coextensive with it. So that if one is to differentiate religion from the rest of life on that ground, as these authors have done, one must indicate which are the values belonging exclusively to religion. Professor King admits that "There are, of course, many values that are not religious, and there are consequently many value-attitudes that have no religious significance." The particular values characteristic of religion are, according to him, those possessing the greatest significance, the greatest permanence, the highest power. Professor Ames writes similarly: "The religious consciousness is just the consciousness of the greatest interests and purposes of life, in their most idealized and intensified forms." "The ideal values of each age and of each type of social development tend to reach an intensity and volume and a symbolic expression which is religious." (E. S. Ames, "Religion and the Psychic Life," Inter. Jour. of Ethics, October, i909, Vol. XX, 49, 52.) Now, all the recognized values can be arranged in a graded series, each term of which will better deserve the epithets permanent, of high power, than the preceding term. Where, then, is the line to be drawn between those that are to be called religious and those that are not ? Wherever it may be drawn, it will mark only a difference of degree between religion and the rest of life. The experiences on one side of the line will be only of greater value, more permanent, more inclusive, than those on the other side. It turns out, then, that this attempt to define religion instead of providing a means of differentiating it from the rest of life, offers a means of connecting together the whole of life. One of the unfortunate results of this conception is that magic cannot be held separate from religion: "In a community of . ... loose organization," writes King, "magic might be so thoroughly taken up by the group as to be indistinguishable from religion." As a matter of fact, a natural line of cleavage between</page><page sequence="3">644 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY religious and non-religious behavior is made possible by the presence in them of ideas of forces of different character. Some of these forces are of the sort to which the name "physical" is applied; others respond to intelligence and feeling, as if they themselves had mind and heart. Religion is that part of human experience in which man feels himself in relation with powers of psychic nature, usually personal powers, and makes use of them. Mr. Wright separates himself from Professors King and Ames in that he rejects "highest values" as the differentia of religion. But I do not see that he is successful in his efforts to provide a satisfactory principle of differentiation. To be religious, actions must, according to him, be believed "to evoke some agency different from the ordinary ego of the individual, or from other merely human beings, and that imply a feeling of dependence upon this agency." This admits, it seems, within the pale of religion man's dealings with merely physical forces when he uses them for the conservation or the production of values, and when he feels dependent upon them. For the ordinary physical forces-heat, and electricity, for instance-are agencies different from "the ordinary ego of the individual, and from other merely human beings," and upon them we are dependent. Does Mr. Wright intend to include in religion the many specific actions by which we use these forces ? If not, the agency must be described so as to exclude them. That is what I have tried to do by using the adjectives "psychic" and "anthropopathic." Thus, Mr. Wright appears to me to be no better off than the two authors above quoted whose conception of religion he thinks too inclu- sive. For him also, "Animism and magic may or may not be religious. They become religious when employed in the endeavor to secure the conservation of socially recognized values." A definition which does not draw a clear line of demarkation between magic and religion fails of an understanding of religion, or of magic, or of both; for although the purpose of magical and of religious action may be identical, the psychic experiences involved in each are substantially different because the power appealed to in each case is of different nature. This I have endeavored to make clear in the second part of a book, A Psychological Study of Religion: Its Origin, Function, and Future, from which I draw in this discussion. The conception of religion I present does not admit of that frequent, excessively broad use of the term which includes anything that is of considerable value to man-music, science, civilization, democracy, duty. I cannot, for instance, agree with those who say that "habitual</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL NOTES 645 and regulated admiration" is worthy to be called a religion, and that "art and science are not secular . ... it is a fundamental error to call them so; they have the nature of religion."' Neither do I find satis- faction in Professor Ames's affirmation that "It is also psychologically evident that the man who tries to maintain religious sentiment apart from social experience is to that extent irreligious, whatever he may claim for himself; while the man who enters thoroughly into the social movements of his time is to that extent genuinely religious, though he may characterize himself quite otherwise."2 This is not putting new wine into old bottles; it is refusing to admit the existence of the bottle! To bestow upon one the appellation religious because he enters thor- oughly into the social movements of his time is to cause confusion by juggling with the word. But if the conception I defend excludes, on the one hand, those excessively broad interpretations destructive of all precise meaning, it includes, on the other hand, the primitive religions in which low desires find gratification through grossly anthropomorphic beings, as well as the highest of the historical religions. It finds room even for the experi- ences of those who feel themselves in relation with an Impersonal Abso- lute, a mere "Principle of unity in a world of which we are not only spectators but parts." These experiences I would, however, distinguish from those which have given rise to the historical religions by classifying them under passive religiosity. JAMES H.
