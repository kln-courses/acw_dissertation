<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 9: Jihadis and the Shi’a  Bernard Haykel  Shaykh al‐Islam Ibn Taymiyya said: ... if the Jews were to obtain a state in  Iraq  and  elsewhere,  the Rafidis  [Shi’a] will be  their greatest  supporters.  They  always  ally  themselves with  the  infidels  among  the polytheists  as  well as  the  Jews and Christians;  they help  them  in  fighting and showing  enmity to Muslims.”   ‐‐ Ibn Taymiyya, Minhaj al‐sunna al‐nabawiyya, (vol. 3, 378)  We  believe  that  the Rejectionist  Shi‘a  (al‐rawafid  al‐shi‘a)  are  a  group  of  unbelievers and apostates, and  that  they  consist of  the most  evil beings  under the celestial dome.  ‐‐ Article 23 of the Creed of Al‐Qa’ida in Iraq  Introduction    Al‐Qa’ida  is  the  product  of  two  ideological  and  religious  streams  that  are  often  in  tension with one another, most prominently with respect to the treatment of the Shi’a.  The first stream is that of the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that has continuously  stressed Muslim unity  and opposed delving  into  intra‐Muslim differences  for  fear of  weakening the effort to establish a state in which the Sharia is implemented. Muslims,  according  to  the Brotherhood, must  seek  to unite and  ignore all  religious differences  that might lead to feuds and strife. For this reason, Sunni‐Shi’a differences must be held  in  abeyance  and  forms  of  Islamic  ecumenism  emphasized.  The  second  stream  in  al‐ Qa’ida  is  that  of  Salafism,  a  puritanical  theological  movement  that  insists  first  and  foremost on purifying the creedal beliefs and practices of errant Muslims.647 The Salafis  are intent on making distinctions between those they consider to be true believers and  those who are  in  error  so as  to delineate as  clearly as possible  the boundaries of  the  community of believers  (Umma). Unity  for  the Salafis  is only possible when everyone  adheres  to Salafi beliefs,  and  as  a  result,  acceptance of  theological diversity does not                                                               647 The Wahhabis are a subgroup of the Salafis and are the followers of the teachings of Muhammad ibn  ‘Abd al‐Wahhab (d. 1792), the founder of the reformist movement whose teachings dominate in Saudi  Arabia. The Salafis I am discussing here are not to be confused with modernizing scholars such as Jamal  al‐Din al‐Afghani and Muhammad `Abduh who do not share the theology or program of these latter day  Salafis. I will use the term Salafis to include the Wahhabis, who represent the most important Salafi group  in modern times. For further information on Salafism and Wahhabism, and the various distinctions  within the movement, see Haykel, 33‐57.  202    </page> <page sequence="2"> form part of Salafism’s  ethos or practice. Salafis,  in other words, are  exclusivists and  seek to reform other Muslims to their own version of Islam, ideally through missionary  work, but in some cases through violent action.    The  distinction  between  these  two  streams  is  further  accentuated  by  the  distinct  geographical  and  political  origins  of  each  movement.  The  Muslim  Brotherhood  emerged  in Egypt  in  the  late 1920s as an anti‐colonial movement  intent on  reversing  Western  dominance  and  influence  in  the  Muslim  world,  whereas  the  Salafis  are  centered on Arabia—though  they have had a presence  in other  regions as well—and  arose most forcefully in the 18th century in opposition to the reprehensible innovations  (bida`, sing. bid`a) and polytheistic (shirk) beliefs and practices of fellow Muslims.648 In  practical  terms,  the Muslim Brotherhood has not opposed Shi’a or Shi’ism  (except  in  Syria—more on this below), whereas the Salafis have continuously vilified and attacked  Shi’a, declaring them to be unbelievers (kuffar, sing. kafir). These two movements have  also differed on the question of whether to engage the Shi’a in armed violence. Salafis  despise and condemn Shi’a for the latter’s theological deviance and for such practices as  the veneration of the tombs of their imams and members of the Prophet’s family (Ahl al‐ Bayt or Al al‐Bayt). While obsessed with vilification of  the Shi’a,  the Salafis also attack  other  Muslim  groups,  including  the  Sufis,  Ash`aris,  Zaydis  and  all  who  believe  in  modern  ideologies  such as democracy, nationalism,  secularism and  feminism, among  others.    It is a notable lacuna that we have no study as of yet of al‐Qa’ida’s views on the Shi’a,  despite  the  significant  ideological  and  physical  attacks  on  this  group  by  al‐Qa’ida’s  ideologues and fighters and the strategic and political importance of this matter.649 This  article  will  explore  al‐Qa’ida’s  views  on  the  Shi’a,  and  how  and  why  these  have  changed over time, especially since 2003, toward greater intolerance of the Shi’a and a  concomitant  decline  of  the  ecumenical  spirit  that  al‐Qa’ida  had  inherited  from  the  Muslim  Brotherhood.  The  study  will  also  underscore  the  increased  dominance  of  Salafism  as  a  set  of  theological  and  political  commitments  among  al‐Qa’ida’s  ideologues, as well as  the  increasing  importance of Arabia and  Jordan as  sources  for  ideological inspiration, recruits and funding.     One repercussion of the virulently anti‐Shi’a trend within al‐Qa’ida is the movement’s  increasing  inability  to  speak  on  behalf  of  all  Muslim  concerns  and  grievances.  Al‐                                                              648 Salafis have historically had a presence outside of Arabia (e.g., Egypt, Syria, Iraq and the Indian  subcontinent), but they have not constituted a dominant political or social force in these regions as they  have in Najd and Yemen at various points in time.  649 Jihadica.com, for example, one of the leading blogs devoted to jihadism studies, has very little to offer  on Al‐Qa’ida’s views on the Shi’a.  203    </page> <page sequence="3"> Qa’ida’s anti‐Shi’ism has diminished  its appeal to the broader Muslim public, as most  Muslims neither share this sectarian animus nor understand the reasons for it. Ayman  al‐Zawahiri, al‐Qa’ida’s second‐in‐command, admitted as much in one of his exchanges.  Only a much smaller group of peoples find this anti‐Shi’a vilification appealing, which  in turn renders al‐Qa’ida’s attempts to garner support and recruits even harder. In other  words,  al‐Qa’ida’s  anti‐Shi’a  rhetoric  and  violent  acts  result  in  its  increasing  marginalization within the Muslim body politic. Al‐Qa’ida’s anti‐Shi’ism  is having the  same effect as  its regular killing of Sunni Muslim civilians: such attacks make  for bad  public  relations and  restrict  the appeal  the movement may have once hoped  to have  among the broad Muslim masses.    Several  important  factors  have  contributed  to  the  increased  importance  of  the  Shi’a  question for al‐Qa’ida. The first was the American invasion of Iraq and the emergence  of the Shi’a as the political beneficiaries of this act and as the newly dominant group in  the Middle East. Shi’a ascent has come at the cost of Sunni decline in influence in Iraq  and elsewhere (e.g., Lebanon). Here, the role of Abu Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi has been very  important  in  associating  al‐Qa’ida  with  the  most  rigid  anti‐Shi’a  views.  The  second  factor has been the emergence of Iran as a major regional actor seeking to monopolize  the Palestinian cause through such groups as Hizballah  in Lebanon and Hamas  in the  Palestinian territories. Al‐Qa’ida’s relationship with Iran appears to have broken down  significantly by mid‐ to late‐2005, which has contributed to a more hardline position by  al‐Qa’ida’s leadership against Shi’a and Iran. Finally, a younger generation of al‐Qa’ida  ideologues  and  activists has  emerged who  are more  rigidly  Salafi  in  orientation  and  therefore more anti‐Shi’a in their attitudes and tactics. Taking these factors into account,  this study aims to show how and why al‐Qa’ida has become more Salafi and to address  the trajectory and implications of this tendency on its views toward the Shi’a.    The Muslim Brotherhood and Shi’ism    It is established in the scholarly literature that the Muslim Brotherhood has held largely  peaceful views with respect to the Shi’a and Shi’ism since its inception. Rainer Brunner,  in his work on the Islamic ecumenical movement in the 20th century that fostered unity  or closeness (taqrib) between Sunnis and Shi’a, has highlighted that Hasan al‐Banna, the  founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, was in favor of this trend.650 The same was true for                                                               650 See Rainer Brunner, Islamic Ecumenism in the 20th Century: The Azhar and Shiism between Rapprochement  and Restraint (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 180‐83 and passim. One particular work that directly attacks the taqrib  tendency and that still is invoked by Salafi‐jihadis is Muhibb al‐Din al‐Khatib’s al‐Khutut al‐`arida li‐l‐usus  al‐lati qama `alayha din al‐shi`a (The Broad Outlines upon which the Religion of the Shiis was Founded).  Many of the same tropes and ideas that Khatib invokes (e.g., glorification of Umar ibn al‐Khattab’s  204    </page> <page sequence="4"> Hasan  al‐Hudaybi,  who  succeeded  al‐Banna  to  the  leadership  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood.651  Al‐Banna  is  noted  for  expressing  the  view—quoting  originally  from  Rashid Rida—that Muslims should “cooperate with each other on agreed upon matters  and forgive each other when it comes to disputed questions.” In effect, this amounted to  ignoring differences and collaborating on the bigger project, namely, the attainment of  power, which was and remains the principal goal of the Muslim Brotherhood. To that  end,  the  capture  of  the  state  was  not  to  be  disrupted  by  theological  or  legal  disagreements. And  it  is  for  this  reason  that  the Muslim Brotherhood continues  to be  regarded  by  the  more  doctrinaire  group,  while  the  ideological  Salafis  are  seen  as  opportunistic, simply vying  for power  in willful disregard of  the principled questions  about what constitutes proper faith and practice.    The trend of ignoring the theological differences between Sunnis and the Shi’a persisted  with Sayyid Qutb,  the most prominent  ideologue of  the Muslim Brotherhood after al‐ Banna and  the godfather of all of  its radical and militant offshoots. One  is at pains  to  find  in Qutb’s oeuvre  any  expression of  condemnation of  the Shi’a on  theological or  legal grounds; they simply do not appear on his list of the enemies of Islam who must  be  fought. Not  surprisingly, Qutb has also enjoyed considerable acclaim among Shi’a  scholars  and  leaders.  No  less  a  figure  than  Iran’s  Supreme  Leader,  Ayatollah  Ali  Khamenei,  has  translated  from  Arabic  into  Persian  the  first  two  volumes  of  Qutb’s  Qur’an  commentary,  In  the  Shade  of  the Qur’an,  as  well  as  Qutb’s  The  Future  of  this  Religion.  Qutb’s  political  register,  which  invokes  and  reformulates  such  Qur’anic  concepts  as  the  oppressed  (mustad`afun)  and  their  struggle  against  the  forces  of  arrogance (istikbar), is to be found in the works of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the  official  ideology  of  the  Islamic Republic  of  Iran. Though  certainly  not  identical,  in  a  number  of  important  respects,  the  ideologies  of Qutbism  and Khomeinism  are  quite  similar.  This  explains  perhaps  the  initial  reticence  of  ideologues  such  as  Ayman  al‐ Zawahiri  or  even  Abu  Yahya  al‐Libi,  both  of  whom  are  drenched  in  a  Qutbist  worldview,  to engage Shi’a  in a  full‐throated attack or  to excommunicate  them  (takfir)  as either being apostates (murtaddin) or infidels (kuffar) ab initio. Of course, since the U.S.  invasion of  Iraq, al‐Libi has changed his views  in  this regard and now excoriates and  vilifies the Shi’a.652                                                                                                                                                                                                  murderer, Ibn al‐`Alqami’s betrayal of the Abbasids to the Mongols, etc.) reappear in more recent Salafi‐ jihadi texts as proof of Shi’a perfidy.  651 I was informed by a learned and well‐informed Shi’a scholar, who wishes to remain unnamed, that  many a Shi’a, from Iran and elsewhere, offered his oath of allegiance (bay`a) to al‐Hudaybi in the 1960s in  his capacity as General Guide (murshid `amm) of the Muslim Brotherhood. Furthermore, it is widely  acknowledged that the Shi’a Hizb al‐Da`wa of Iraq has had many ideological and programmatic affinities  with the Muslim Brotherhood and that the influence between the two movements was reciprocal.   652 See Nar al‐Majus fi Jazirat al‐`Arab, http://www.tawhed.ws/r?i=j8w00ngm (accessed 7 September 2010).  205    </page> <page sequence="5">   It is only in Syria that the local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood adopted an anti‐Shi’a  position, mainly from the 1980s onwards. When the 1979 revolution took place in Iran,  members of various country branches of  the Muslim Brotherhood  sent delegations  to  Iran  to  offer  congratulations  to  the  leadership  in  Tehran.  They  saw  in  the  Iranian  revolution  a  populist  Islamic  revolutionary  movement  that  had  toppled  a  Western‐ backed secular  tyrant and,  therefore, a model  for change  to be emulated  in  their own  societies.  Iran’s  revolutionary  ideology was  seen  as pan‐Islamic,  sharing  the Muslim  Brotherhood’s  ideals  and goals,  and not  as  sectarian  or nationalist.  Sa`id Hawwa  (d.  1989), a prominent member of  the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, went  to  Iran  in 1979,  where he met with Ayatollah Khomeini and other officials. His aim was to explain the  Brotherhood’s  rebellion  against  the  Ba`thist  regime  in  Damascus,  which  was  led  by  Hafiz  al‐Asad,  a  Nusayri‐Alawi  by  sectarian  affiliation.653  Hawwa  hoped  to  elicit  Tehran’s support and patronage against Asad. One of Hawwa’s biographers describes  him as seeking Iran’s help in “the name of the brotherhood in Islam that Iranians share  with the Muslims of Syria.”654 He was to be disappointed. Tehran decided to give its full  support  to  the  Asad  regime  with  which  it  has  maintained  a  strong  and  enduring  alliance, despite the Muslim Brotherhood’s crushing defeat in the city of Hama in 1982  and  the  massacre  of  many  Sunni  civilians.  This  confirmed  for  the  Syrian  Muslim  Brotherhood  that  the  Islamic Republic was a regime driven by Shi’a sectarianism and  Iranian nationalism, earning Tehran the group’s eternal enmity.655 The survivors of the  Hama defeat  ended up mostly  in Europe  and Saudi Arabia, while  some went  to  the  Afghan‐Pakistan  frontier  region  where  a  new  front  against  the  Soviet  Union  had  emerged.  Saudi  Arabia  would  now  become  the  principal  patron  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood,  solidifying  a  trend  already  established  in  the  1960s, when many  of  the                                                               653 The Nusayris, in modern times more commonly known as Alawis, are an extremist sect of Shi’ism.  Until quite recently, Nusayris were rejected by more mainstream Sunni and Shi’a groups such as the  Twelvers or Imamis and the Zaydis, who did not consider them to be Muslim but heretics. However, the  Nusayris have made considerable efforts to appear to be more orthodox Shi’a and therefore be  recognized by the Twelvers as proper Shi’a. This attempt has met with mixed results. Cf. H. Halm,  “Nusayriyya,” in Encyclopaedia of Islam, ed. P.

Unlike Sa`id  Hawwa,  one  former  Syrian  Muslim  Brother  was  apparently  never  beguiled  by  Khomeini or his revolution. This  is the Islamist  ideologue Muhammad Surur Zayn al‐ `Abidin, who lived in Saudi Arabia from 1965 and then in Kuwait in the 1970s, and thus  never  faced directly  the wrath of  the Asad regime.  In Arabia, Surur developed a new  form of  Islamism  that blended  the organizational methods and political worldview of  the Muslim Brotherhood with  the  theological puritanism of Salafism, a  trend  that has  since been  labeled Sururism.657 Surur wrote an  important and much quoted anti‐Shi’a  work  entitled Wa  Ja’a Dawr  al‐Majus  (The  Era  of  the Magians Has Come)  under  the  pseudonym `Abd Allah Muhammad al‐Gharib.658 Although not  initially subsidized by  the Saudi government or  its  religious establishment,  this book became a best‐seller  in  the early 1980s and was widely distributed by  the official Saudi ulama  in  its effort  to  counteract the influence of the Iranian revolution and Khomeini’s ideology.659 The work  draws on a long history of anti‐Shi’a polemics and adds political analysis of the Iranian  revolution  to  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  Shi’a  and  Iranians  have  from  the  earliest  times been nefarious enemies of Sunni Islam and the Arabs. Its blend of theological and  historical  argumentation,  as  well  as  contemporary  political  analysis,  has  been  the  fodder for a number of Salafi‐jihadi ideologues and thinkers, most notably Abu Mus’ab  al‐Zarqawi and his erstwhile mentor the Palestinian Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi.                                                                           656 Other Syrians would establish relations with Qatar, such as Zuhayr al‐Shawish, and others still with  Kuwait. Yet, Saudi Arabia was the principal patron and refuge for the Brothers who fled those countries,  like Egypt, Syria and Iraq, that were taken over by military regimes with secular ideologies.  657 Al‐Rasheed (2007), 66 and passim; Stephane Lacroix, Les Islamistes Saoudiens une Insurrection manquée  (Paris: PUF, 2010), 84 and passim.   658 The term Majus typically refers to Zoroastrians, but the author is using it pejoratively to refer to the  Shi’a, and in so doing is stripping Shi’a of their association with and belonging to Islam.  659 See the interview with Muhammad Surur, aired on the television program  Muraja`at (part 4), in which  he admits to authoring this book and to the allegedly unexpected reaction and support of the Saudi  ulama, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtnX4jeZMDw&amp;feature=channel (accessed 7 September 2010).  207    </page> <page sequence="7"> The Salafis and Shi’ism660    By contrast with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis have a long anti‐Shi’a tradition to  draw upon, dating from pre‐modern times. Indeed, a sectarian animus against the Shi’a  is one of the constitutive elements of the core beliefs of Salafism. Salafis, in other words,  are required to evince hatred toward the Shi’a in order to be true believers. It is for such  purposes  that  the doctrine of association  (with Muslims) and disassociation  (from  the  enemies of Islam), Al Wala’ Wal Bara’ is invoked and implemented. For the Salafis, the  Shi’a are theological deviants and the enemies of true Islam, and the former often repeat  the  claim  that  the  two  groups’  respective  differences  are  creedal  (usul  al‐din),  and  therefore  fundamental  and  irreconcilable,  and not over disputed  legal matters  (furu`)  that are open to debate. The locus classicus for the Salafi attack on the Shi’a can be found  in  Ibn Taymiyya’s book Minhaj al‐sunna al‐nabawiyya  fi naqd kalam al‐Shi`a al‐Qadariyya  (The Prophetic Paradigm’s Method  in Criticizing the Teachings of the Qadari Shi’a).661  The  Shi’a,  whom  the  Salafis  refer  to  pejoratively  and  abusively  as  the  rejectionists  (rafida), are accused of a multiplicity of grave sins and are considered infidels (kuffar).662  Among the litany of Shi’a crimes is the fact that the Shi’a rejected the legitimate rule of  the  first  three Rightly Guided Caliphs  or  successors  to  the Prophet Muhammad  and  declared  that  Ali  ibn  Abi  Talib  (the  4th  caliph)  was  designated  explicitly  (nass)  by  Muhammad as his  immediate successor. Because of this, the first three caliphs and all  those Companions (sahaba) who sided with them against Ali are grave sinners and are  regularly cursed by  the Shi’a. The crime of cursing of  the Companions, especially but  not  exclusively Abu Bakr, Umar  and  `A’isha  (one  of  the Prophet’s wives),  is  an  oft‐ repeated  accusation  leveled  at  the  Shi’a  and  has  legitimated  acts  of  violence  against  them by Salafis. For the Salafis, this cursing of the Prophet’s companions is an attack on  the best generation of Muslims, who transmitted the custom of the Prophet (Sunna) and  upon  whose  authority  the  entire  corpus  of  traditions  (Hadith)  rests.  Without  the                                                               660 The Shi’a referred to here are principally the Twelver or Imami Shi’a, who are numerically dominant in  Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain. Salafis apply their blanket condemnation of Shi’ism to its other sects,  namely the Zaydis of Yemen and the Isma`ilis, but the latter two groups are not going to be addressed  here.  661 Ahmad b. Abd al‐Halim Ibn Taymiyya, “Minhaj al‐sunna al‐nabawiyya,” in Mu’assasat Qurtuba, ed.  Muhammad Rashad Salim (n.p., 1986). The Qadaris are a theological group that adhere to reason‐based  arguments (as opposed to a literal adherence to the proof‐texts of revelation) and are associated with the  Mu`tazilis.  662 The term Rafida (sing.: Rafidi) is also related to an episode in the life of the imam Zayd b. Ali (d. 740)  who was rejected by a group of Shi’a sympathizers for his refusal to condemn Abu Bakr and Umar, the  first two caliphs. See “Rafida,” in Bearman, et al. There is a dispute among Salafis, and other Sunnis, as to  whether all Shi’a are infidels or only their learned and political elite. This is a debate of crucial importance  for the Salafi‐jihadis because it establishes the basis upon which all, as opposed to only some, Shi’a are  legitimate targets of violent attack (more on this point below).  208    </page> <page sequence="8"> Hadiths,  there  is no Sunna and without  the Sunna,  Islam, as  taught and practiced by  Salafis,  is effectively eviscerated. Even worse, Salafis accuse the Shi’a of believing that  the Qur’an  as we have  it  today  is not  the original  revelation, but  rather  a  corrupted  version  that does not  incorporate certain verses, especially  those  in which Ali’s rights  are mentioned.663    Salafis, as well as some other Sunnis, explain Shi’a perfidy by asserting that their beliefs  are based on Judaism because one of its alleged founders, `Abd Allah ibn Saba’, was of  Jewish origin. An indication of this link is that the Shi’a introduced anthropomorphism  (tashbih) into Islam, which Salafis argue is a Jewish belief. Other theological deviations  of the Shi’a include their belief that their imams are immune from error and sin (`isma)  and,  in  legal  matters,  the  Shi’a  engage  in  forbidden  practices  such  as  precautionary  dissimulation  (taqiyya),  temporary marriages  (mut`a) and  ritualized  self‐flagellation  to  commemorate  the martyrdom  of  al‐Husayn,  the Prophet’s grandson,  at  the hands  of  Umayyad forces. The list of Shi’a sins and crimes is longer still, and includes doctrinal  affinities with the Mu`tazila, but it all amounts to a complete repudiation of the Shi’a as  Muslims.664 In recent times, the aforementioned Jewish connection has been resuscitated  very  effectively  to  explain  contemporary  events, namely  the  alliance between  the  so‐ called Zionists and Crusaders with the Shi’a to topple the Sunni regimes of the Taliban  in Afghanistan and  that of Saddam Hussein  in Iraq, as well as Iran’s strengthening of  the Shi’a in both Syria and Lebanon against the Sunnis.    The  Salafi  scholars  of  the  Arabian  Peninsula,  especially  those  associated  with  Wahhabism, have played a leading role in the attack on Shi’ism and the Shi’a, but there  have also been others  from earlier  times.665 More  recently,  ideologues  from Syria and  Jordan who have wanted to identify with an Arabian Salafi‐style of Islam have taken up  the same cause. Through  this  identification,  they have sought  to garner recognition of  their  authority  among  a  global  Salafi  community  and  perhaps  also  patronage  from  Arabia. What is noteworthy is that both Usama bin Ladin and Ayman al‐Zawahiri, the  number one and two leaders of al‐Qa’ida, did not invoke or delve into attacks on either  Shi’a or Iran until quite recently, and apparently somewhat unwillingly. This highlights                                                               663 It is important to note that not only Salafis level such accusations against the Shi’a, other Sunnis do so  as well. However, this animus toward the Shi’a is a marker of identity for the Salafis, which is not the  case for other Sunnis, and it is largely Salafis, or those inspired by them such as the Taliban in  Afghanistan and Pakistan, who have engaged violently with the Shi’a and used the arguments mentioned  above as justification for this.  664 A theological sect that emphasized the use of reason‐based arguments in the formulation of its beliefs  and tenets, s.v.

Usama Bin Ladin and Ayman al‐Zawahiri on Shi’a    A search  for  references  to  the Shi’a  in  the writings and speeches of Usama bin Ladin  and Ayman al‐Zawahiri before 2003 results in virtually no mention of the sect, let alone  any polemical  engagement against  it.666 Until  recently, Bin Ladin has been  reticent  to  attack  the  Shi’a,  no  doubt  a  reflection  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  influence  on  his  thought,  but  also  because  he  has  diligently  sought  to  present  himself  as  a  unifying  figure for the entire Muslim world against the enemy infidels. The same can be said for  Ayman al‐Zawahiri, one of whose principal works, Knights Under  the Prophet’s Banner,  makes no mention of Shi’a or Shi’ism.     The  arrival  of  U.S.  troops  in  Iraq  in  2003  and  the  emergence  of  a  Salafi‐led  Sunni  insurgency against  them changed matters considerably  for Bin Ladin and Zawahiri. It  quickly emerged that through its invasion, the United States had empowered Shi’a who  would now exclude Sunnis  from power and end  their dominance  in  the very heart of  the Muslim and Arab worlds.  In  response  to  this, Salafi groups  emerged  to  fight  the  Americans and  the Shi’a  in  Iraq. Leadership of  these Salafis quickly devolved  to Abu  Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi who, after 2004, forged an alliance with al‐Qa’ida. Unlike Bin Ladin  and Zawahiri, Zarqawi’s  ideological  inspiration  came  from  a  source  that drew more  directly on the Salafi heritage of Ibn Taymiyya and the Wahhabis of Arabia, as well as  the Syrian and  Jordanian  ideologues who have  since  the mid‐1970s  identified openly  with  an  anti‐Shi’a  Salafism.  Zarqawi  rejected  on  principle  the  accomodationist  and  ecumenical approach of the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Ladin and Zawahiri had to come  to  terms  with  this  explicitly  anti‐Shi’a  Salafi  tendency  and  they  did  so  largely  by  accepting its terms, although with some prevarication.     Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi’s Website Minbar al‐Tawhid wa‐l‐Jihad    It  is  accepted  among  the  community  of  scholars  and  analysts who  follow  the  Salafi‐ jihadi movement  and  phenomenon  that  `Isam  ibn Muhammad  al‐Barqawi  (aka Abu                                                               666 Bruce Lawrence, ed., Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden (London and New York:  Verso, 2005); Laura Mansfield, transl., In His Own Words: a Translation of the Writings of Dr. Ayman al  Zawahiri (TLG Publications, 2006). I was able to find one reference by Ayman al‐Zawahiri to Iran and  Shi’a in an interview he gave to Nashrat al‐Ansar (no. 91) in 1995. Here he adopts the softest possible  approach a Salafi is able to have when he says that ordinary Shi’a are not apostates and the learned  among them can only be considered apostates if they persist in their erroneous beliefs after the truth is  shown to them.

It also contains works, both medieval as well as modern,  that  jihadis rely on  to make  their case and  justify their actions. This section of the article will present the anti‐Shi’a  content  on  this  website  in  order  to  provide  a  sense  of  the  Salafi‐jihadis’  ideological  worldview and the resources they draw upon.    The Tawhed.ws site has a special page dedicated to the Shi’a under the rubric of “sects  and  schools,”  a  section  that  is modeled  on medieval  Islamic heresiographical works,  except  that  it also  includes pages with  tracts  condemning  such modern  ideologies as  nationalism, democracy and Communism, among others heresies. The page devoted to  the Shi’a unfolds into four sub‐pages dedicated respectively to tracts against Hizballah  in  Lebanon  and  to  the  Israel‐Lebanon war  of  2006,  the Alawites  in  Syria, Ayatollah  Khomeini and,  finally,  the suffering of  the Sunnis of Iran.668 The main page  is divided  into  three  sections—books  and  studies,  articles  and  treatises,  fatwas  and  responses— with each containing a  list of  titles  that can be downloaded by clicking on  individual  links. Here one  can download or  read online  thirty‐one books,  thirty‐six  articles  and  fourteen  fatwas.  The  volume  of  material  is  considerable  and  some  titles  run  into  hundreds of pages of text, all in Arabic. Examples of the titles are “The Refutation of the  Rejectionists”  (al‐Radd  `ala al‐Rafida) by Muhammad  ibn  `Abd al‐Wahhab; “Narratives  and Texts from the Corrupt Shii Sect” and “Words and Poems in Condemnation of the  Infidel  and Wicked Rejectionists,” both by Sharif  al‐Rajihi;  and  “The Betrayals of  the  Shiis and their Effect on the Defeats of the Muslims” by `Imad Ali Husayn.    The content of  these  texts  repeat  the same arguments against  the Shi’a—namely  their  eternal enmity and betrayal of  true  Islam because of  their heretical beliefs—and offer  endless quotations from earlier texts by Ibn Taymiyya and other scholars to underscore  the perfidy and unbelieving character of Shi’ism and its adherents. A small number of  these  texts are authored by pre‐modern  scholars, namely  Ibn Taymiyya,  Ibn al‐Jawzi,  Muhammad  ibn  `Abd  al‐Wahhab  and Muhammad  al‐Shawkani,  among  others. Also  represented  is Muhibb al‐Din al‐Khatib’s work vilifying  the Shi’a and  the ecumenical  efforts (taqrib) that were in vogue in the first half of the 20th century.                                                                 667 Joas Wagemakers has conducted the most extensive research on al‐Maqdisi to date and has conducted  interviews with him in person. See, among other articles and works, his “The Transformation of a Radical  Concept: al‐wala’ wa‐l‐bara’ in the Ideology of Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi,” in Meijer (2009), 81‐106.  668 On the page dedicated to Khomeini, the site makes a pejorative pun on the title Ayatollah (lit. sign of  God) by referring to him as Ayat al‐Shaytan (sign of Satan).  211    </page> <page sequence="11"> The majority of the titles about the Shi’a on tawhed.ws, however, are by contemporary  scholars, some of whom are  from Arabia, while others are closely  linked  to  the Saudi  religious  and  legal  establishment  or  are  among  the  younger  stars  of  the  Salafi‐jihadi  movement from Syria and Jordan. Broadly, the divide between the authors is fourfold.  First,  there  are  those  writers  whose  worldview  and  arguments  are  rooted  in  a  pre‐ modern Salafi and Wahhabi arguments, notably  that  the Shi’a are grave worshippers  and creedal deviants. Second, there are former Syrian Muslim Brothers who have their  own  anti‐Shi’a  views,  which  crystallized  around  their  hatred  of  the  Nusayri‐Alawi  regime of  the Asad  family  in Damascus and  its ally,  the  Islamic Republic  in  Iran. The  third  group  is  represented  by  the  Jordanian  and Palestinian  activists  and  ideologues  who have been heavily influenced by an Arabia‐centered Salafism, and who combine a  theological and political discourse that draws from the Muslim Brotherhood as well as  the  sectarianism  of  the  Salafis. Fourth,  and  finally,  are men  like Ayman  al‐Zawahiri,  only a couple of whose statements on Iran are highlighted, underscoring that the core  leaders of al‐Qa’ida have very little, if anything, to say about the Shi’a.    A number of further distinctions can be made among the authors, such as those who are  graduates  of  the  Islamic  University  in  Medina,  perhaps  the  major  center  of  Salafi  scholarly production  in  the  last  few decades. Many have  impeccable Salafi credentials  and some have built their reputation by specializing exclusively in anti‐Shi’a polemical  works. Examples of  scholars  and preachers who  are Arabian or  linked  to Arabia  are  Muhammad Mal Allah  of Bahrain, Hamid  al‐`Ali  of Kuwait  and  the Pakistani  Ihsan  Ilahi Zahir. Mal Allah has written over twenty titles, mostly condemning the Shi’a, and  Ilahi Zahir has done the same, treating the Shi’a and other purportedly deviant groups  in the Pakistani context. Indeed, perhaps no single scholar has been more influential in  aggravating  Sunni‐Shi’a  tensions  and violence  in  the  South Asian  context  than  Ihsan  Ilahi Zahir, with such  titles as  the “Shiis and  the Qur’an” and “Between  the Shiis and  the Sunnis.”669                                                                 669 Although he does not touch on Ihsan Ilahi Zahir, Muhammad Qasim Zaman has an excellent study on  the rise of sectarianism in Pakistan. See Muhammad Qasim Zaman, “Sectarianism in Pakistan: the  Radicalization of Shi`i and Sunni Identities,” Modern Asian Studies 32, no. 3 (1998), 689‐716. A study of  Ilahi Zahir’s works is a major desideratum as would be a publication on the influence that Salafis have  had on the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The latter appear to have adopted entirely the sectarian  animosity that the Salafis have for the Shi’a and this perhaps explains the recent and dramatic rise of  suicide bombings and other violent attacks on Shi’a throughout Pakistan. One likely route for the  transmission of Salafi views to the Afghan and Pakistani context can be the activism and publications of  ideologues like Ihsan Ilahi Zahir and, in Afghanistan, of the late Jamil al‐Rahman (d. 1991), who had  strong connections to Arabian Salafism.  212    </page> <page sequence="12"> The  last group  that  is  represented  in  the  listed works  consists of  the  ideologues  and  activists  of  the  Salafi‐jihadi  movement  and  al‐Qa’ida’s  leadership.  Their  titles  have  regularly  been  downloaded  or  read  online  by  tens  of  thousands  of  visitors,  if  the  numbers listed on the webpage are to be trusted. Amongst the most prominent names  are  the  Saudi  ideologues  Nasir  al‐Fahd,  Sulayman  al‐`Alwan,  `Ali  al‐Khudayr,  the  Syrian Abu Basir al‐Tartusi, the Egyptian Ayman al‐Zawahiri (one text on Iran, not the  Shi’a), the Palestinians Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi and Abu Anas al‐Shami, and finally  the Jordanian Abu Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi.    By way of  the  flavor of  the  content  that  can be downloaded, here  is what  the  Saudi  ideologue `Ali al‐Khudayr states in his fatwa about the Shi’a:  What we have  today are  the Rafidis  [i.e., Twelvers],  the Batini  Isma`ilis,  the Batini Nusayris, and the Batini Duruz. These four groups are the ones  who deify  the Al al‐Bayt [i.e., the family and descendents of the Prophet  Muhammad],  they  seek  their  intercession  and  are  the  worshippers  of  graves  (quburiyyun).  So  these  [people]  are  infidel polytheists  (mushrikun  kuffar)  and  are  not  Muslims.  There  is  no  difference  [in  status]  between  their  scholars  and  followers  (muqallidihim)  or  the  ignorant  among  them  (juhhalihim). They are all polytheists and are not Muslims and cannot be  excused  for  their  claim  to  be  ignorant  that  they  are worshipping  other  than God (la yu`dharun bi‐l‐jahl fi `ibadatihim li‐ghayr allah).670    This  fatwa  is  important because  it has provided  the  authority  for  some Salafi‐ jihadis  to  legitimize  their  violent  acts  against  all  Shi’a,  without  distinction  between  the  learned  and  the  unlearned  or  the  civilian  and  the  so‐called  collaborators with the U.S. occupation forces or the regime in Baghdad. Fatwas,  including  this  one  specifically,  are  invoked  by  the heirs  of Zarqawi  in  Iraq  to  justify wanton acts of  savagery and bloodshed against  the Shi’a. The excessive  nature of the violence has even raised questions and criticism among Salafi‐jihadi  ideologues and from al‐Qa’ida’s core leadership, namely about the strategic and  tactical value of such acts (more on this below).    Another  fatwa on  the  list,  this  time by  the Syrian  Islamist Abu Basir al‐Tartusi,  who  lives  in  the United Kingdom,  responds  to  the  following questions:  “As  a                                                               670 `Ali ibn Khudayr al‐Khudayr, Fatwa fi l‐Shi`a, http://www.tawhed.ws/r?i=d5opc80b (accessed 7  September 2010).  213    </page> <page sequence="13"> Muslim how should I interact with the Shii Rejectionist? What is the threat that  Iran represents to the future of this region?” The response states:    Interact with the Shii Rejectionists as you would with a person whose very  existence  is  full of betrayal,  treachery,  fury and hatred against Islam and  Muslims!... Interact with them as you would with someone who sees the  violation  of  your  sanctities  to  be  an  act  of  sacrifice  for  and worship  of  God... [T]he only thing stopping him from harming you is the fear of the  Sultan’s  sword  and  of  those who  are powerful! As  for Rejectionist  Iran  and the danger it poses to the region, this is represented by its intense and  persistent  efforts  to  convert  the  region  to  Shiism  and  to  spread  Rejectionism and Shiism among its folk...and then to follow this up with  the spread of its [i.e., Iranian] power and domination over the region... In  order to accomplish this, Iran is willing to offer huge sacrifices and many  concessions  to  the  enemies  of  the Muslim  nation  (umma),  and  to  spend  large sums of money...671    The views expressed in the two aforementioned fatwas encapsulate the sum total  of  the  Salafi‐jihadi  view  of  the  Shi’a  as  represented  by  the  Arabian  Wahhabi  tradition  on  the  one  hand,  and  by  the  more  politicized  Muslim  Brotherhood‐ inspired activists on the other. Iran’s role in particular and its carving up of what  is perceived  to be Sunni Arab  lands  through  the creation of a  large Shi’a Arab  country  spanning  the  Arabian  Peninsula  has  been  graphically  illustrated  in  a  phantasmagorical map that has been circulating on jihadi forums. It is called the  Eastern Arabian Republic and contains the bulk of Saudi oil reserves.672     This combination of theological and political condemnation has been adopted in  its entirety by a new generation of activists such as Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi  and  incarnated  in practical and  tactical  terms by men  like Abu Anas al‐Shami  and  Abu  Mus’ab  al‐Zarqawi.  Al‐Maqdisi,  as  we  shall  outline  below,  would  eventually have a slight change of heart regarding the indiscriminate targeting of  Shi’a, but his reformed views appear to have had little practical effect in Iraq and  elsewhere.                                                                     671 Abu Basir al‐Tartusi, Kayfa yata`amal al‐muslim ma` al‐rafida, http://www.tawhed.ws/r?i=0ikenzs8  (accessed 7 September 2010).  672 The map can be seen at http://shamikh1.net/vb/showthread.php?t=39493 (accessed 7 September 2010).  214    </page> <page sequence="14"> The War in Iraq and Abu Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi    The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which effectively led to the disempowerment of  Iraqi Sunnis and to the rise of the Shi’a to power, brought a new dynamic to the  global war on terror and changed the nature of al‐Qa’ida’s tactics and thinking.  The  war  in  Iraq  precipitated  the  emergence  of  a  new  leadership  within  al‐ Qa’ida’s  ranks, one  that  is  less  informed  about  Islamic precepts  and  teachings  and  more  willing  to  engage  in  unconstrained  and  undisciplined  forms  of  violence.  This  development  was  embodied  in  the  person  of  Abu  Mus’ab  al‐ Zarqawi, and  through him  it also  forced al‐Qa’ida  to become much more anti‐ Shi’a in its rhetoric, ideological output and actions. The war opened a new front  in the heart of the Arab and Muslim world, which effectively meant that the so‐ called far enemy could be fought on occupied Muslim territory and need not be  attacked  across  an  ocean.673  Moreover,  the  classical  rules  and  laws  of  Islamic  warfare,  which  argue  that  Muslims  are  individually  obligated  to  defend  themselves against a non‐Muslim aggressor, now clearly obtained, and resorting  to violent confrontation was more easily justified. This was a defensive war, not  an  offensive  one  where  more  cumbersome  rules  applied  and  that  was  more  difficult to justify. In Iraq, as in Afghanistan, any able bodied Muslim willing to  go into combat was enjoined to do so.    Furthermore,  regardless  of  the  fact  that  the  Shi’a  of  Iraq  are  a  demographic  majority, the promotion of the Shi’a to the highest posts in government—and the  fact that a number of these politicians had been protégés of the regime in Iran— was perceived by the ideologues of al‐Qa’ida, and by many other Sunni Arabs, as  a  joint  conspiracy  by  Shi’a  and  Americans  to  take  over  the  region.  It  is  not  difficult to see in the empowerment of the Shi’a in Iraq a replay of the story, so  often  invoked  in  Salafi  texts,  of  when  the  Abbasid  caliphate  in  Baghdad  was  destroyed  by  the Mongols  because  of  the  aid  of  Shi’a  like  Ibn  al‐`Alqami  and  Nasir al‐Din al‐Tusi. History was repeating  itself and  the Sunnis had  to defend  themselves by counterattacking and foiling the plot.    Abu Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi  rose  to become  the man of  the hour and  the one who  would  lead  the  fight.674  Zarqawi,  a  Jordanian  Islamist  and  an  acolyte  of  Abu                                                               673 On this point, see the chapter by Steven Brooke and the concluding chapter of this volume.  674 For additional sources on Abu Mus’ab al‐Zarqawi’s treatment of the Shi’a, see Hafez (2007), 70‐78, 120‐ 28; Nibras Kazimi, “A Virulent Ideology in Mutation: Zarqawi upstages Maqdisi,” Current Trends in  Islamist Ideology 2 (2005), 59‐73; Steven Brooke, “The Preacher and the Jihadi,” Current Trends in Islamist  Ideology3 (2005), 52‐66; Nibras Kazimi, “Zarqawi’s Anti‐Shia Legacy: Original or Borrowed?,” Current  Trends in Islamist Ideology 4 (2006), 53‐72.  215    </page> <page sequence="15"> Muhammad al‐Maqdisi, only  formally  joined al‐Qa’ida  in 2004 and  for  reasons  that are not firmly established. Some have argued that the formal affiliation with  al‐Qa’ida may have had to do with garnering financial support and recruits from  Arabia for the fight in Iraq. Be that as it may, Zarqawi was a Salafi‐jihadi and he  brought to bear this ideological framework when analyzing the situation in Iraq  and  the  strategy  to  be  pursued  there.  His  focus  lay  in  wanting  to  create  an  Islamic state in Iraq, modeled after the Taliban emirate in Afghanistan, and to do  so he needed to galvanize the Sunni Iraqis to rise up to fight for its creation and  defense. He wished  to  secure  a  territorial  base  from which  to  conquer  further  territory and foment  jihad  in other regions of the Islamic world. In this respect,  he was  a  faithful  follower  of  al‐Qa’ida’s  core  leadership’s  strategy,  namely  to  recreate  a  unitary  Islamic  state  in  the  form  of  the  caliphate  through  the  establishment  first  of  a  series  of  emirates  ruled  in  accordance with  al‐Qa’ida’s  interpretation of Islamic law. To accomplish this, Zarqawi struck upon a strategy  that, as described in an intercepted letter in 2004 sent by Zarqawi to al‐Qa’ida’s  leadership  in Afghanistan,  involved striking  repeatedly and  indiscriminately at  the Shi’a so as to foment a sectarian civil war that would unite the Sunnis from  Iraq and elsewhere with his cause.675    Zarqawi’s advice is quite revealing and thus deserves to be quoted in extenso:    These  in our opinion  are  the keys  to  change.  I mean  that  targeting  and  hitting  them  [i.e.,  the  Shi’a]  in  [their]  religious,  political,  and  military  depth will  provoke  them  to  show  the  Sunnis  their  rabies  and  bare  the  teeth  of  the  hidden  rancor  working  in  their  breasts.  If  we  succeed  in  dragging them  into the arena of sectarian war,  it will become possible to  awaken  the  inattentive  Sunnis  as  they  feel  imminent  danger  and  annihilating death at the hands of these Sabeans [i.e., Shi’a]. Despite their  weakness and fragmentation, the Sunnis are the sharpest blades, the most  determined, and the most loyal when they meet those Batinis (Shi`a), who  are a people of treachery and cowardice....  They  [i.e.,  the  Shi’a]  have  declared  a  secret  war  against  the  people  of  Islam. They are the proximate, dangerous enemy of the Sunnis, even if the  Americans are also an archenemy. The danger from the Shi`a, however, is  greater and  their damage  is worse and more destructive  to  the  [Islamic]  nation  than  the Americans, on whom you  find  a quasi‐consensus  about  killing them as an assailing enemy.                                                               675 Hafez (2007), 75‐78.  216    </page> <page sequence="16"> They  [i.e.,  the Shi’a] have befriended and  supported  the Americans and  stood in their ranks against the mujahidin. They have spared and are still  sparing no effort to put an end to the jihad and the mujahidin.  Our fighting against the Shi`a is the way to drag the [Islamic] nation into  the battle....676    Zarqawi  pursued  his  stated  strategy  relentlessly  until  his  death.  His  suicide  bombers  struck  a  path  of  destruction  and  killing,  leading  to  the  death  of  hundreds  if not  thousands  of people, mostly  Shi’a,  including many  at various  holy  shrines and mosques  in  Iraq. Ultimately, Zarqawi did help bring about a  sectarian war between Sunnis and Shi’a, one  that  the Sunnis of  Iraq effectively  lost  and  that  led  many  to  abandon  and  turn  against  al‐Qa’ida.  Furthermore,  Zarqawi’s aim of radicalizing Sunnis and recruiting large numbers of them to his  cause was not successful. The violence he unleashed led to a Shi’a backlash that  broke the back of the Sunnis who then renounced al‐Qa’ida, seeming to seal  its  fate in the country.677    Jihadi Criticism of Zarqawi    Zarqawi’s strategy of indiscriminately targeting Shi’a elicited a relatively strong  response  from  two unexpected quarters, and he and his  supporters  then  spent                                                               676 For the text of the intercepted letter, see  http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/02/040212‐al‐zarqawi.htm (accessed 7  September 2010).  677 Many journalists and analysts of the war in Iraq have attributed the defeat of al‐Qa’ida to the U.S.  troop surge of 2007 under the leadership of General Petraeus, although it appears that this took place for  more complicated reasons. The U.S.‐led coalition tried from 2004 onward to make the Sunnis realize that  they had to re‐embed themselves in Iraqi institutions while the U.S. was still present to ensure fair play.  Once the U.S. drew down, the argument went, there would be no chance for the Sunnis to gain access to  patronage networks, the armed forces, government positions, etc. The anti‐Sunni brutality among the  Shi’a militias, the running of secret prisons by the government where Sunnis disappeared and the risk  that any Sunni politician would be branded and excluded as a Ba`thi made many young urban Sunnis  believe there was no alternative to Zarqawi’s nihilistic approach. In the internecine warfare that took  place in 2006 and 2007, the Sunnis were effectively defeated by the Shi’a. Many Sunnis were made  refugees and realized that the Shi’a were not going to be defeated or give up their newfound power in the  country. This realization, in combination with the U.S.‐led initiative that was initiated in the rural areas of  Anbar to foster the Sahwa movement and to win over tribal networks, led many Sunnis to turn against al‐ Qa’ida and to join the ranks of the U.S.‐sponsored and financed “Awakening Councils.” The urban  Sunnis did not join this effort until quite late in the game and never fully. That the tribes were the first to  accept this initiative indicates that they are not inherently anti‐Shi’a, and this can be explained in part by  the fact that a number of the tribes are constituted by Shi’a as well as Sunni clans (e.g., the Dhu  Muhammad, Shammar).   217    </page> <page sequence="17"> considerable effort defending his actions. The first to censure him, albeit politely,  was  his  former  mentor  Abu  Muhammad  al‐Maqdisi,  first  in  2004  and  then  publicly  in  2005  during  an  interview  on  al‐Jazeera  television.  The  gist  of  al‐ Maqdisi’s critique revolves around Zarqawi’s undisciplined and excessive use of  suicide bombing attacks in which civilian Muslims were being killed, his wanton  excommunication  of  fellow  Muslims  and  his  killing  of  ordinary  Shi’a.  He  presciently argued that this would lead to the destruction of a carefully nurtured  generation of jihadi fighters in Iraq, where they would be consumed by heedless  violence. And because of this, the prime objective of rebuilding the glories of the  Islamic nation  and  the  establishment  of  the  caliphate would  be  squandered.678  Furthermore, al‐Maqdisi makes  it clear  in  the al‐Jazeera  television  interview, as  well as  in his  introduction  to Abu Anas al‐Shami’s pamphlet entitled The Shiis,  that he  rejects  the blanket  excommunication of  the Shi’a,  the  targeting of  their  mosques or the killing of their ordinary folk. Like Ibn Taymiyya before him, al‐ Maqdisi argued  that  the general Shi’a masses are not  to be considered  infidels;  nor is any one to be accused of this without some process of verification, which  involves finding out what the individual person actually believes.679 So while al‐ Maqdisi is not in principle against suicide attacks, he feels that Zarqawi has gone  too far in his tactics and that these are proving harmful to the jihadi current (al‐ tayyar al‐jihadi).    The second person to criticize Zarqawi during this same period in 2005 is Ayman  al‐Zawahiri.680  He  writes  to  Zarqawi  acknowledging  in  a  perfunctory  manner  that  the Shi’a are  indeed  colluding with  the Americans,  that  they have always  been  treacherous  and  that  their  beliefs  are  at  odds  with  those  of  the  Sunnis.  However, Zawahiri states:    [T]he majority of Muslims don’t comprehend this and possibly could not  even  imagine  it. For  that  reason, many of your Muslim admirers among  the  common  folk  are  wondering  about  your  attacks  on  the  Shia.  The  sharpness of the questioning increases when the attacks are on one of their  mosques, and  it  increases more when  the attack  is on  the mausoleum of  Imam  Ali  Bin  Abi  Talib,  may  God  honor  him.  My  opinion  is  that  this  matter won’t be acceptable  to  the Muslim populace however much you                                                               678 See the Abu Muhammad al‐Maqdisi’s interview with al‐Jazeera at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55FVvEj‐Oww&amp;feature=related (accessed 7 September 2010).  679 See Abu Anas al‐Shami, al‐Shi`a, 4‐6 http://www.tawhed.ws/dl?i=0504095f (accessed 7 September  2010).  680 See Shmuel Bar and Yair Minzili, “The Zawahiri Letter and the Strategy of Al‐Qaeda,” Current Trends  in Islamist Ideology 3 (2006), 38‐51.  218    </page> <page sequence="18"> have  tried  to  explain  it,  and  aversion  to  this  will  continue.  Indeed,  questions  will  circulate  among  mujahideen  circles  and  their  opinion  makers about the correctness of this conflict with the Shia at this time. Is it  something that  is unavoidable?... And  if the attacks on Shia  leaders were  necessary  to  put  a  stop  to  their  plans,  then why were  there  attacks  on  ordinary Shia?681    Zawahiri  goes  on  to  ask  further  questions,  such  as  whether  it  is  possible  to  exterminate all the Shi’a, hinting at the futility of Zarqawi’s effort. Furthermore,  he argues that al‐Qa’ida does not need to offend Iran by attacking Shi’a because  Tehran is holding al‐Qa’ida prisoners, and that Iran and al‐Qa’ida must not fight  with  one  another  because  there  is  a  larger menace  represented  by  the United  States.  Unlike  al‐Maqdisi’s  concerns,  Zawahiri’s  are  really  about  al‐Qa’ida’s  public  relations  campaign  among ordinary Muslims. Being  from Egypt, where  there are virtually no Shi’a, he knows  that Zarqawi’s  tactics would not be well  received. The Umma, Zawahiri feels, would not understand the reason why the  Shi’a  are  being  targeted  and  consequently  turn  against  al‐Qa’ida  or  find  its  propaganda unappealing. His perspective  is  geographically  broader  and more  inclusive,  in  keeping  with  al‐Qa’ida’s  original  aims  to  represent  the  global  Muslim  community  against  Western  imperialist  aggression.  Zawahiri  is  also  implicitly  acknowledging  to  the  limitations  of  Salafism  inasmuch  as  most  Muslims do not  share or  sympathize with  its puritanical zeal against  so‐called  errant Muslims, such as  the Shi’a. Without a doubt, Zawahiri also had  in mind  the appeal that a political movement and group like Hizballah in Lebanon would  have  among Muslim publics  around  the world. Not  only  is Hizballah  able  to  attack  Israel  to considerable effect and  in direct military  fashion,  it deliberately  avoids drawing  attention  to  itself  as  a  Shi’a group. This  appeal would  test  all  Salafis,  al‐Qa’ida  as  well  as  others,  in  the  summer  of  2006,  when  Hizballah  engaged Israel in a war whose outcome was deemed by many a qualified victory  for the former.    By contrast with Zawahiri, Zarqawi’s view was more local, focused on trying to  galvanize the Sunnis of Iraq and the neighboring countries to his cause, but also  clearly using this strategy against Shi’a to stake a leadership position for himself.  And this fits with a more generalized phenomenon among Salafis and no doubt  other  radical  religious  and  political movements,  namely  that  the  newly  rising  and ambitious leaders tend to be more extreme than the incumbent leaders. This  outbidding  feature  of  the  competition  over  leadership  allows  a  rising  star  to                                                               681 Mansfield, 268‐69.  219    </page> <page sequence="19"> make a name for himself because it attracts attention and it is underpinned by a  claim that the older leaders have gone soft and lost their zeal and commitment to  the  principles  of  Salafism.  Zarqawi’s  aims  in  Iraq—to  resist  and  repel  the  apostate Shi’a who are collaborating with  the Crusader occupiers—fit perfectly  with Salafism’s longstanding and well‐established anti‐Shi’a ideology. Moreover,  if most Muslims  did  not  understand  his  strategy,  then  he would  endeavor  to  show them that the Shi’a were even more dangerous enemies of Islam than the  Crusaders.    Zarqawi Responds    Zarqawi defended himself against the two sets of criticism by stating that, as the  commander on the ground, he was a better  judge of the situation in Iraq and of  which tactics best served the cause of jihad. Commanders on the front lines often  advocate a more  forward and hard  line policy, and he was not different  in  this  regard.  In addition, Zarqawi  issued recordings  in which he made more precise  legal and political arguments to support his tactics and to show that he, too, had  mastery  of  the  legal  and  religious  canon  and  was  not  to  be  taken  for  an  ignoramus.  In  one  of  these  recordings  entitled  “The  Grandchildren  of  Ibn  al‐ `Alqami have Returned” (Wa `ada ahfad Ibn al‐`Alqami), Zarqawi tries desperately  to  justify  suicide  attacks  despite  the  deaths  of  innocent  Muslims  in  such  operations.682  He  states  that  Muslim  casualties  are  inevitable  and  that  jihad  would  cease  altogether  if  these  deaths,  however  regrettable,  were  to  be  considered grounds for banning such attacks. He then goes on to justify his total  war  on  the  Shi’a  by  arguing  that  the  latter’s  attacks  on  Sunnis,  including  the  seizure of mosques, the wholesale expulsion of Sunnis from various regions and,  most shockingly, a campaign of rape against Sunni women, all justify the war he  has  waged  on  them.  Zarqawi  repeats  and  expands  on  these  same  themes,  rehashing  vituperatively  many  of  the  aforementioned  anti‐Shi’a  polemics  and  tropes,  in  a  recording  entitled  “Have You Heard  about  the Rejectionists?”  (hal  ataka hadith al‐rafida), which he produced shortly before his death in June 2006.683    On  the  Internet, meanwhile, Zarqawi’s  supporters and members of his groups  have been active in defending him. One such defense, from what appears to be a  source  within  al‐Qa’ida  in  Mesopotamia,  is  worth  focusing  on  because  it  summarizes most  succinctly  the  justificatory  arguments  for  attacking  the  Shi’a                                                               682 See http://www.tawhed.ws/dl2?i=2209099n (accessed 7 September 2010).  683 A transcription of this text and its table of contents can be found at  http://www.tawhed.ws/r?i=wck7070p (accessed 7 September 2010).  220    </page> <page sequence="20"> that al‐Qa’ida’s  core  leadership has  found difficult  to  rebut. From  its  tone and  content, this document is intended for an internal jihadi audience. It appeared on  several  jihadi  websites,  including  Hanin  Network  (Shabakat  Hanin),  which  focuses principally on the jihad in Iraq, and Shumukh al‐Islam Network.684 Entitled  “The Response  to  those who Disapprove of  the Declaration of Al‐Qaeda  (Abu  Mus`ab al‐Zarqawi) of a Total War on the Rejectionists  in all Parts of Iraq,” the  text is about eight pages in length and quite detailed in its argument. The author  begins  by  explaining  that  Abu  Mus’ab  al‐Zarqawi  engaged  in  this  policy  in  response  to  the Shi’a attack on  the Sunnis of Tal Afar  in 2005, where al‐Qa’ida  had an  important presence, and  that  this should be understood as  treatment  in  kind  (mu`amala  bi‐l‐mithl)  for what  the  Sunnis have  endured. Those who have  criticized Zarqawi did not do so on the basis of sound Islamic  legal arguments,  but  rather  on  the  basis  of  what  would  make  for  good  public  relations  and  publicity. The author then sets the stage by explaining that, while it is legal and  legitimate  for  the  jihadis  to  target  ordinary  Shi’a  civilians,  al‐Qa’ida  in  Mesopotamia only resorted to this when “God’s enemies [i.e., Shi’a] crossed ‘the  red lines’ in their war on the Muslims, namely by attacking the honor of Muslim  women” and by engaging  in a genocidal ethnic war against the Sunnis, civilian  or  otherwise.685  This,  in  turn,  has  created  an  “exceptional  situation”  that  has  obligated the  jihadis to engage in actions of “necessary deterrence” on the basis  of “treatment in kind.”686    The legal argumentation that follows is contorted and forced, in keeping with the  justifications to which jihadis often resort for their actions. The author states that  some of  these actions against  the Shi’a may be  legally prohibited  (muharram)  in  Islamic law on principle or as independent acts, but because they accomplish one  of God’s aims (ghaya maqsuda li‐l‐shari`), namely deterrence (rad`) and the ending  of  attacks  (hasm)  on Muslims,  they  are  deemed  permissible under  exceptional  circumstances. He then cites several Qur’anic verses to give further  justification  for  retaliatory acts,  such as: “And  there  is  life  for you  in  retaliation, O men of  understanding,  that  you  may  be  pious”  (2:179);  “whoever  acts  aggressively  against you, inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on you”  (2:194); “And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which  you were  afflicted”  (16:126).687 After  this,  he  cites  various  Prophetic  traditions  (Hadiths)  in  which  the  Prophet  Muhammad  condemned  certain  people  to                                                               684 See http://www.hanein.info/vb/showthread.php?146693 (accessed 7 September 2010);  http://shamikh1.net/vb/showthread.php?t=51746 (accessed 7 September 2010).  685 See http://www.hanein.info/vb/showthread.php?146693 (accessed 7 September 2010).  686 Ibid.  687 Ibid.  221    </page> <page sequence="21"> especially violent forms of execution (not the usual beheading but mutilation and  multiple amputations) for heinous crimes that they had committed. These severe  penalties, the author states, were for exceptional circumstances, such as the one  in Iraq today, and consistent with serving God’s purpose of deterrence so as “to  send a clear message to the enemies of this religion that they reconsider several  times  [their schemes] before crossing  the red  lines against  the Muslims.”688 The  point of all this is that none of the usual rules of warfare, such as discrimination  in  targeting  and  proportionality,  obtain  for  the  Shi’a  of  Iraq;  their  women,  children and civilians are all fair game unless it is deemed that such killings will  prove  harmful  to  al‐Qa’ida’s  media  and  public  relations  efforts  (al‐siyasa  al‐ shar`iyya al‐i`lamiyya).     The  last section of  the document quotes  from  the  leading Salafi scholars of  the  past (Ibn Taymiyya, Muhammad ibn `Abd al‐Wahhab, Sulayman ibn `Abd Allah  Al al‐Shaykh) to make the case that all Shi’a are indeed infidels and deserve to be  killed as would an  infidel enemy  (kafir harbi). Here  is how  the author describes  them:    The ordinary  folk of  the Imami Twelver Rejectionists  (= Shiis) are  infidel  polytheists. They worship  the dead among  their  imams of  the Prophet’s  family  and  believe  that  these  have  attributes  of  Lordship  such  as  knowledge of the unknown and power to determine events in this world.  They  dedicate  to  them  worshipful  acts  by  invoking  them  without  mentioning God  and by  seeking  their  aid  in  times  of distress  and  ease,  asking them to remove worry and to forgive sins, as well as making vows  and sacrificing to them.689    This amounts to a complete rejection of the arguments that Abu Muhammad al‐ Maqdisi had made about differentiating between ordinary civilian Shi’a and the  learned leaders of the community, as well as the claims that Ayman al‐Zawahiri  had made  that ordinary Muslims would be put off by such violent acts against  Shi’a.    Conclusion    Al‐Qa’ida  is  indelibly  tarred  by  its  association  with  attacks  on  Shi’a  and  is  therefore identified strongly in the minds of many Muslims as a radical sectarian                                                               688 Ibid.  689 Ibid.  222    </page> <page sequence="22"> movement  that cannot claim  to be  the defender of  Islam. Unlike  the days after  9/11, when al‐Qa’ida could claim  to have struck a blow at  the enemy of  Islam,  today  its  association  with  Zarqawi  cannot  be  easily  forgotten  or  fully  understood. Clearly, al‐Qa’ida has not been able to transcend its ideological roots  in  pre‐modern  Salafism;  in  fact, when  confronted  by  resurgent  Shi’a,  it  clung  more  forcefully  to  this  tradition  and  used  it  instrumentally  to  accomplish  its  political  aims. These were  the  radicalization  of  fellow  Sunni Muslims  and  the  control of territory in order to establish an embryonic Islamic state. The fight was  no longer about resistance to American imperialism; instead, the defeat of more  ancient enemies  took precedence. Al‐Qa’ida’s affiliates, such as al‐Qa’ida  in  the  Arabian Peninsula, have adopted a similar anti‐Shi’a rhetoric when referring  to  the Zaydis in northern Yemen, and this has perhaps become a permanent feature  of its ideology and strategic thinking.690 Zawahiri, with his Muslim Brotherhood  background,  was  clearly  worried  about  this  sectarian  hard  edge  and  was  appealing  to  Zarqawi  to  think  more  broadly  than  Iraq,  of  the  larger  Muslim  world and what harm his violence was doing to al‐Qa’ida’s reputation and pan‐ Islamic claims. He was not able to prevail.    One region where al‐Qa’ida’s anti‐Shi’ism might resonate and draw supporters  and recruits is Arabia. Here, a living tradition of anti‐Shi’ism persists and is not  being confronted or contained sufficiently by  the governments of Saudi Arabia  and  other  Gulf  Cooperation  Countries.  If,  in  the  end,  al‐Qa’ida’s  appeal  is  restricted  to Arabia and  to parts of Pakistan where  the Taliban have developed  anti‐Shi’a views similar to Zarqawi’s, this would be far from ideal but it remains  better  than  a  movement  that  can  generate  mass  sympathy  and  potential  supporters from across the Islamic world. It is clear that al‐Qa’ida cannot do the  latter  in  part  because  its  hatred  for  the  Shi’a  is  not  shared  by  most  Sunni  Muslims. Al‐Qa’ida’s anti‐Shi’ism,  like  its suicide attacks  that kill  innocent and  civilian Muslims, is an important chink in its ideological armor.                                                                   690 See Sada al‐malahim, no. 11, 25‐26, and no. 12, 20‐21.
