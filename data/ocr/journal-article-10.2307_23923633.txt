<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ruth Mellinkoff, Antisemitic Hate Signs in Hebrew Illuminated Manu scripts from Medieval Germany. Jerusalem: Center for Jewish Art, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1999. Pp. 158; 92 color, and black-and white illus. This short, but lavishly produced book focuses on a group of Hebrew illumi nated manuscripts made in Germany in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The group consists of more than a dozen Mahzorim, Pentateuch, and Haggadah codices and other miscellaneous works (a Mahzor is a festival prayer book, and the Hag gadah is the ritual recited on Passover eve in the home at the seder table). These books contain a considerable number of images in which the human figure appears in distortion, either with an exaggerated physiognomy, with the head of an animal, or else with an obliterated or veiled face; in addition, the manuscripts also feature a variety of animals that Jewish culture considers unclean, such as dogs, pigs, or asses, as well as motifs plainly adapted from Christian religious iconography. Opin ions are divided as to the exact origin and function of this imagery. Whereas many scholars consider, for instance, the avoidance, partial substitution, or distortion of the human face as a compromise with the anti-iconic injunctions of the Second Commandment, other writers are convinced that some of the deformed figures repre sent in fact caricatured Jews and may derive from the stage masks used in medieval Christian drama. In her latest study Ruth Mellinkoff offers yet another, certainly quite radical, explanation. It is her contention that, although commissioned by Jewish patrons and written by Jewish scribes, the books in question were exclusively illustrated by Christian artists, who, as members of the Christian majority, inserted "antisemitic hate signs" into their images of which their Jewish audience was largely unaware. The author begins by making a case for the Christian artist, who, she asserts, would have illustrated the manuscript under the supervision of a Jewish scribe (ch. 1). Due to an almost complete lack of documents or artist's "signatures" (as in a colophon, for instance), her evidence is necessarily circumstantial. Her argument partly rests on the assumption that whereas Jewish masons and sculptors had ample occasion to study Christian architecture and statuary, the access of a hypothetical Jewish illuminator to a Christian manuscript would, on the contrary, have been more difficult, because as ritual objects such books would have been jealously guarded Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 185</page><page sequence="2">against misuse or being pawned to Jews by both secular and ecclesiastical authorities. Confining artistic activity and inspiration to the availability of a single medium, Mellinkoff concludes that the books in question must have been illumi nated by Christian artists. Briefly alluding to the host desecration accusation and the pogroms that followed in its wake, the chapter ends with a cursory sketch of the "antisemitic" cultural climate in which the artist would have worked, and which would have contributed to his or her desire "to deprecate the Jews by inserting hate signs into Hebrew manuscripts" (17). Having established the Christian identity of the artists and their German cultural (and, by extension, "antisemitic") background, the author, in a sequence of individual chapters, confronts us with a whole panoply of "hate signs." Scholars familiar with Mellinkoff s previous monograph, Outcasts: Signs of Otherness in Northern European Art of the Late Middle Ages (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), will already have encountered some of the imagery. The reader thus learns about the "derogatory significance of the profile position" (19), known from Christian medieval depictions of Cain, Judas, and Christ's torturers, but also found in the illustrations of Hebrew books, such as the tripartite Mahzor (three volumes: I, Budapest, Lib. of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Kaufmann Collection A384; II, BL, MS Add. 22413; III, Bod. Lib., Mich. 619; dated ca. 1325) (ch. 2). According to Mellinkoff, the negative connotation of profile heads increases significantly when shown with the stereotypical Jewish physiognomy of enlarged mouths, puffy lips, and hooked noses. In a number of micrographically illustrated manuscripts, such stereotypes are associated with, or visually juxtaposed to, those of animals, goats in particular. Micrography involved the weaving of minute Hebrew letters around the outlines of human figures, animals, or abstract designs, and could therefore only be executed by skilled Jewish scribes. But because some of these motifs have previously been singled out as "hate signs," the reader is led to believe that "a Christian artist was employed to do the preliminary guidelines, which were utilized afterwards by a Hebrew micrographer, who, like his Jewish patron and scribe, did not identify these as antisemitic stereotypes" (28); (ch. 3). A further "hate sign" uncovered by Mellinkoff is the ubiquitous Jew's hat, a required badge which medieval Jews accepted with a kind of fatalism, or, as the author puts it, because "they [the Jews] recognized the reality of their lives" (34); (ch. 4). Chapter 5 presents a whole menagerie of animals that were associated with negative qualities in either Christian or Jewish culture or in both. In the tripartite Mahzor, for in stance, female characters are frequently shown with the heads of cats, dogs, and asses, animals that for Jews had particularly unclean connotations, whereas for Christians the terms "dog" and "ass" could on occasion provide derogatory epithets 186 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="3">for the Jews themselves. The presence of these unsavory beasts in Hebrew manuscripts seems to underpin the hypothesis that the Jewish audience was utterly oblivious to the cunning pictorializations of the artists' "antisemitism": Since the pig, ass, and dog were anathema to twelfth- and thirteenth-century German Jews, we would not expect Jewish scribes or patrons to have chosen dogs, pigs, or asses for portrayal in their manuscripts. But if a Christian artist portrayed those animals, the scribe and patron may not have noticed them, or having seen them, they may not have understood their significance (42). However, even if understood by both artist and patron, an illustration may have had two quite distinctive meanings. Discussing the many featureless or covered faces represented in some manuscripts, for example in the Dresden Mahzor (Dresden, Sächsische Landesbibl., MS A46a; dated ca. 1290), Mellinkoff argues that the covering of eyes with hats, garlands, and crowns may have served a double purpose that satisfied both scribe and artist. Although seemingly complying with the Second Commandment, the covering of faces was equally used in Christian ico nography to signify Jewish mental blindness, exemplified most famously by the veil over the eyes of Synagoga (ch. 6). Chapter 7 looks at the way in which a specific Christian iconographie formula—the mystic union between Christ and Ecclesia— was used to illustrate an eleventh-century Hebrew poem based on Song of Songs 4:8 that allegorized the love of God for the people of Israel. Observing that in some versions of this theme God is shown wearing a Jew's hat while Israel is undis guisedly represented as Synagoga, Mellinkoff claims that satirical intentions underlay the transposition of this Christian topos from one visual culture to another. Her enumeration of "hate signs" concludes with a brief chapter on those illustrations that allegedly demonize the Jews and depict bizarre figures with red or dark brown faces, beast-like heads, and wearing Jew's hats, such as the shofar blower in the Hammelburg Mahzor (Darmstadt, Hessische Landes- und Hochschulbibl., Or. 13; dated 1348) (ch. 8). The reviewer finds it difficult to share many of the author's views. The visual material contained in these manuscripts certainly poses many questions, which are at once bewildering and challenging and almost always disturbing. Unfortunately Mellinkoff s book comes nowhere near to doing justice to the complexity of the pic torial evidence. Her study is methodologically problematic and disconcerting in view of what it seems to imply. In order to accommodate what is, in fact, an extremely heterogeneous body of material—comprising full- and half-page miniatures, mar ginalia, micrography, and narrative and iconic images—Mellinkoff reduces the pur pose of the imagery to that of a single formula. Her fundamental tenet—that Christian artists illuminated the group of manuscripts under discussion—derives much of its Studies in Iconography 22 — 2001 187</page><page sequence="4">momentum from an argumentum ex silentio. Although there is indeed little internal or documentary evidence to suggest that the books under scrutiny were illuminated by Jewish artists, there is equally no reason to conclude that, simply because there exist certain stylistic and iconographie correspondences to the art of the Christian majority, the manuscripts must therefore have been executed in Christian work shops. Our knowledge (or ignorance) of who illustrated these magnificent codices owes much to the geographical and chronological distribution of the surviving material. Jewish artists' signatures are thus recorded for fourteenth-century Spanish manuscripts, and in at least one case an illuminator also originated from Germany (Joel ben Simon, who signed a number of manuscripts during the second half of the fifteenth century). This is hardly enough evidence to suggest that during the thir teenth and fourteenth centuries German Jewish artists were not actively involved in Hebrew book production. There is likewise no reason to assume that, even if denied access to Christian manuscripts, this would have been the sole source a Jewish illuminator might have turned to had he wanted to copy or adapt certain elements of Christian style or iconography. Medieval art abounds with examples of cross-media fertilization, of manuscripts deriving their imagery from panel- and wall-painting, even from sculpture, and vice versa; the use of patternbooks is equally widely documented. One might even ask whether indeed the relationship between Jewish and Christian craftsmen was always so antagonistic as to preclude a minimum of artistic or cultural exchange. Possibly the most unjustified conclusion Mellinkoff draws from her own line of reasoning is that a Christian artist furnished the outlines for a number of rather crude zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures in the South German Hebrew Bible (BnF, Hebr. 8, 9, 10; dated 1304), which the Jewish scribe would later have traced with micrographie script. This essentially implies that even a highly skilled Jewish calligrapher was unable to master a rather basic level of drawing. Probably the greatest weakness of the book is its failure to address the rela tionship between text and image. Images are presented here as being invested with an a priori meaning that is either "antisemitic," or, by implication, "prosemitic." Animals that Jewish culture considers unclean thus have an automatically deroga tory significance. That these meanings do, in fact, oscillate according to (con)text is demonstrated by Marc Michael Epstein's analysis of the motif of the hare hunt in his 1997 study, Dreams of Subversion in Medieval Jewish Art and Literature (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press). The hare is not a kosher animal, and hunting by Jews was condemned in rabbinic literature; yet, the iconog raphy of the hare hunt flourishes in medieval Hebrew manuscripts from France, Germany, and Spain. Epstein shows that far from being a "hate sign" inserted by a 188 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="5">Christian artist for his largely private delectation, this image had a double function for its Jewish audience, which was both practical and symbolic. Frequently found in Haggadah manuscripts, the hare hunt provided a visual parallel to a Talmudic mnemonic in which the order of blessings to be recited at the seder table of Passover (when the Haggadah was read) was memorized by fusing the initials of a number of Hebrew catchwords into the single acrostic YaKiNeHaz, which in the linguistic context of Judeo-German sounded very much like jag den has ("hunt the hare"!). It is to be expected that once analyzed within its proper textual framework much of Mellinkoff s material will reveal a similar purpose. Beyond its mere practicality, the motif of the hare hunt also had an allegorical meaning. Epstein convincingly shows that the image could equally function as a symbol for the persecution of Israel by the nations of the world: The hare [also] has a negative meaning for medieval Christians. It stood as a symbol for homosexuals, and by extension, for Jews. Thus Christians, who were the hunters, had defined the Jews, their quarry, as hares: the majority culture imposed the symbol upon the minority. Once branded with this sign of calumny, Jews set about very matter-of factly to redeem it and transform it from an emblem of infamy to a superlative metaphor of Jewish self-definition (27). Mellinkoff s argument leaves no space for such a subtle reappropriation of imagery, yet one might ask again whether some of the examples she chooses to discuss were not exactly that, a deliberate iconographical choice on the part of the Jewish patron or artist, a conscious visual contribution to the making of medieval Jewish identity. However, as long as the Jewish users of manuscripts are being presented as ignorant and oblivious, unable to read even those signs and metaphors that served as emblems of their oppression and encapsulated most strongly their problematic relationship with their Christian neighbors, no such contribution seems possible. All this is not to say that the manuscripts in question might not contain any anti-Judaic "hate signs" at all. But a much more thorough and integrated approach is needed to provide more definite answers to this and other problems these fasci nating books continue to pose.
