The author of these seven volumes has already published another seven volumes in the Actualité Series on systems of reference and motion in classical mechanics, and has now undertaken an examination of the same questions from the point of view of relativistic mechanics. His attitude is mainly historical, critical and philosophic, and the idea is to expose the basic principles of the subject without being too mathe matical. Laying aside for the moment his critical evaluation of the theory, it must be said that the exposition of the subject matter of the theories of relativity is done very well indeed, in the first, second, fourth and fifth volumes of the series. A brief historical introduction to the circumstances under which Einstein was led to formulate his theory is followed up by a sketch of the main steps in the development of the doctrine of relativity, viz., the special theory, the transitional theories, the general theory and later generalisations. The second volume on special theory gives some recent methods of deductions of the Lorentz transformation by Lalan, Esclangon and E. Leroy. The principles of the general theory are explained in non-mathematical language in the fourth volume, followed by a treatment of special gravitational prob lems in the next one. Schwarzschild's investigations are given a very prominent place, and treated very fully in view of its applications to the three experimental veri fications of the theory. The author's opinion regarding these verifications is that the relativistic explanation of the advance of the perihelion of Mercury alone is satis factory and constitutes a brilliant success of the theory.

The conviction that we acquire after reading these thought-provoking volumes, is that a great gulf still separates the view points of the physicist and the philosopher, and that this gulf can be bridged only by a great physicist who can think of philosophy in philosophic terms.
