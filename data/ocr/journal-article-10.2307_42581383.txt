<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD* GUSTAF STRÖMBERG [Foreword, by A. KORZYBSKI: To explain the importance of Dr. Strömberg' s paper in a few words is difficult. To begin with t let me quote Professor Tracy Thomas , who is an important mathema- tician in the field of tensor analysis and differential invariance , differential geom- etry, and theory of relativity: rThe title which I have selected for this lecture is "The Concept of Invariance in Mathematics. 1,1 In making this selection I have been influenced by the naive reason that this expresses rather accurately what I shall mainly talk about although I real- ize full well that such a title will carry no specific meaning to many of the non- mathematicians in the audience. A more appealing title would have been " The Theory of Relativity." As a matter of fact we shall be concerned in what fol- lows with the theory of relativity, al- though we shall not limit ourselves to a consideration of this theory as com- monly thought of, namely , as a theory of physics. Rather we shall be concerned with the underlying aspects of relativity conceived as a general principle in mathe- matics as well as physics. It will be my * Reprinted by permission of the author and the editors from Journal of the Franklin Insti- tute, Vol. 239, No. 1 (January, 1945). 1 Faculty Research Lecture, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1944. $.25. endeavor to present these ideas with the utmost simplicity, subject only to the re- quirements of accuracy of statement. You will see that the above-mentioned con- cept of invariance enters as a unifying principle in the developments .* This quotation is given to show the modern trend in mathematics and in physics, to show the flexibility and inter- changeability of different attitudes , which ultimately turn out to be practically equivalent, but taken from different points of view. The newest achievements which ulti- mately culminated in the epoch-making liberation of atomic energy have not been due to mathematicians alone or physicists alone. It took the combined non-elemen- talistic efforts of mathematical physicists, mathematicians, astronomers, etc. The as- tronomers deal mostly with the very large, but like sub-atomic physicists , they deal also with the very small (sub-atomic in- terior of stars, etc.). Both disciplines do not follow aristotelian, euclidean, and newtonian types of orientation. The lay- man must be familiar at least with the non-aristotelian methodology to be able to guide himself intelligently in the fun- damental reshaping of our knowledge of the universe, life included. Dr. Strömberg is an astronomer born and educated in Sweden, and since 1911 has been at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, 12</page><page sequence="2">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD California . He is an outstanding specialist in stellar motion , statistics , and lumin- osity , astrophysics , etc., which means deal- ing with the mysteries of the world in the very large and the very small. It must be remembered that Einstein's work is also based on the study of the very large and the very small, with which the old orien- tations sifnply cannot deal. The paper of Dr. Strömberg cannot be summarized simply; the original has to be read carefully many times. It gives an entirely new outlook on old problems. This may sound simple; in fact it is not,, because it affects our habitual orientations. For milleniums, and since childhood we are accustomed to deal with the gross data of the macroscopic level. As to the very large , the reader should realize that in astronomy, due to enormous stellar dis- tances, we may see a 'stať where really there is no star left ; its light is perceived by us long after the 'stať may be 'dead,' and yet the light waves are still reaching us and our photographic cameras , and so our calculations must be inferential, as in the submicroscopic, or sub-atomic levels. An astronomer must be familiar with the physical working of this universe on both levels , of which we perceive only the gross averages registered by our senses ( even if aided by instruments), and from ivhich we unduly generalize. So far as we know we human beings are a product of the universe; that is, a product of an interplay of the very large cosmic influences and the very small sub- atomic and submicroscopic energy pat- terns. So far as we know the two levels interact, which ultimately may result in you and me, the way we are, that inter- play resulting in so-called ' mentality .' Dr. Strömberg makes a bold attempt to reconcile the various levels by formulat- ing a more general theory as a synthesis. It seems that this is the only reasonable way to do. In his 9 The Autonomous Fielď he summarizes previous papers on the sub- ject. One of the main points is that we on the gross macroscopic level orient our- selves in terms of r particles.' To the av- erage man, even the electron is a sort of f pebble.' Strömberg generalizes still fur- ther the field physics originated by the great Faraday ( in contradistinction to par- ticle physics). In such a formulation the endless possibilities in the electronic struc- ture of the world and the electro-colloidal structure of life become less mysterious and so more easily handled. Strömberg boldly eliminates f pebbles' (particles ) and establishes our orientation about the world and ourselves on the basis of au- tonomous fields of energy, thus abolishing the old aristotelian limitations and block- ages which were due to our old maps that do not correspond to the actual territory- world. To quote Strömberg: ' Summarizing , we may say that force fields should not be regarded as being caused by any par- ticles, but are autonomous entities built of indivisible, coherent units defining probabilities in space and time. The par- ticles are nature's own evanescent indica« tors of the fine structure of preexisting fields and are associated with emergence of definite amounts of energy into the physical world of space and time. Atoms and matter in general are not aggregates of particles, but can best be described as energy patterns defining the amount, the vector properties, and the probable place of the emergent energy at a given time. Potential energy and probability of emer- gence of energy are atmost synonymous concepts. The theoretical problems, or the map- territory relations, are still not clear. Modern mathematical physics is based on new orientations where the f matter* is less and less r material' and becomes a problem 13</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS of relations , probabilities, degrees of free- dom, the notion of fields, etc., and re- quires non-aristotelian infinite-valued no- tions , such as infinite-valued causality, in- finite-valued determinism, etc. It is a natural evolution of our understanding the world. After all, our knowledge of the world is our knowledge of the world, and never it. As the mathematician Lewis Carroll puts it in Alice in Wonderland, f . . the patriotic archbishop of Canter- bury, found it advisable - " "Found what? said the Duck. "Found it," the Mouse replied rather crossly : "of course you know what riť means." "I know what (iť means well enough, when I find a thing, n said the Duck : "it's generally a frog, or a worm." ' The great astronomer and mathema- tician A. S. Eddington described the situ- ation in the following words, r The rela- tivity theory of physics reduces everything to relations; that is to say, it is structure, not material, which counts. The structure cannot be built up without material; but the nature of the material is of no im- portance. ... We cannot describe sub- stance ; we can only give a name to it. Any attempt to do more than give a name leads at once to an attribution of struc- ture. But structure can be described to some extent; and when reduced to ulti- mate terms it appears to resolve itself into a complex of relations ... A law of na- ture resolves itself into a constant relation ... of the two world-conditions to which the different classes of observed quantities forming the two sides of the equation are traceable. Such a constant relation inde- pendent of measure-code is only to be expressed by a tensor equation .' Great theoretical physicists such as Niels Bohr, Richard Tolman, Enrico Fermi, Lize Meitner, and many others , their work based on the theory of Ein- stein, finally succeeded in liberating atomic energy, all of which is due to the attempts to unify field theories. It seems that Dr. Strömberg succeeded in produc- ing the most general autonomous field theory . Einstein himself writes about Strömbergs book, The Soul of the Uni- verse, where these ideas were first pre - sented. ' What especially impressed me was the successful attempt to isolate the essential facts from the bewildering array of dis- covered data and the presentation of them in such a way that the problem of the unity of our knowledge acquires a mean- ing. .. .Very few men could of their own knowledge present the material as clearly and concisely as he has succeeded in do- ing. . . . The attempt to unify our knowl- edge is in any case commendable at a time when almost every one forgets the whole in the investigation of the parts/ In the book just mentioned Dr. Ström- berg depends a great deal not only on the data of astronomy, astrophysics,' sub-atomic physics, mathematical physics, etc., but also on the electro-colloidal data of biology, embryology, genetics, neuro- physiology, and the general disciplines which deal with life and life manifesta- tions, 'mind' included. Students of general semantics should be forewarned that in his general theory, which seems thoroughly justified and very much up to date , Dr. Strömberg here and there is using anthropomorphic terms , and uses sometimes ' space1 and 'time' in- stead of ' space-time ' in his struggles with the natural linguistic difficulties of the presentation of a new synthesis. Such minor linguistic discrepancies should be disregarded at present, as no pioneer can produce a perfect product at first. We cannot possibly understand life without understanding the fundamental interplays 14</page><page sequence="4">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD of autonomous fields of energy patterns. In ending this foreword , I can do no better than again quote Eddington: ' Rather against my better judgment I will try to give a rough impression of the theory. It would probably be wiser to nail up over the door of the new quantum theory a notice , " Structural alterations in progress - No admittance except on busi- ness ," and particularly to warn the door- keeper to keep out prying philosophers /] I OF have LATE undergone OUR ideas a great about change. force fields The have undergone a great change. The first important change was introduced by Einstein and was an essential part in the general theory of relativity. Even more radical changes in our ideas were found necessary as the result of the development of modern wave mechanics. Studies of the epistemologica! foundations of force fields in general have also thrown much light on the subject. One result of these studies has been that many scientists have become reconciled to the idea that fields may be nothing more than sets of gen- eralized rules expressing space and time relations in mathematical or geometrical knguage. Although the generalization of the field concept has made it rather ab- stract, it is, nevertheless, admirably suited to explain, or rather to picture, a host of phenomena which were completely in- tractable on the basis of the older field concept. These new ideas have made it necessary to revise our classical concepts about the causal relationship between mat- ter and its associated field. This revision, which entails a complete reversal of old ideas, has made it possible to apply the field concept to a number of biological phenomena, in particular to the progres- sive organization during embryonic de- velopment. With every new application, the field concept has grown in importance, it has become an autonomous regulator of events, and as a consequence we now begin to see not only the world of matter but also the world of life in a new per- spective. For a long time most people thought that the earth 'pulled down' all objects near its surface, and that electrically charged or magnetic bodies 'compelled' other bodies in their neighborhood to move in certain ways. Tracing the effects to the elementary particles of matter, scientists pictured them as attracting or repelling one another and in general to be the cause of accelerated motions. Great difficulties were encountered when at- tempts were made to explain the high concentration of electric charge on ex- ceedingly small particles and to under- stand the behavior of these particles at very small distances. Faraday had called attention to the fact that the field itself had specific properties, and he was the originator of field physics, in contradis- tinction to particle physics. The relativity theory describes a field physics in which the field is guiding the path of light beams and bodies in space and time according to certain rules. An observable 'event' occurs when two such paths ('world lines') cross. A field is hence observed as a 'pattern of events,' and from such patterns the properties of guiding fields are derived. These properties can be de- scribed as due to 'field potentials,' which vary continuously from one point in space- time to another. As in classical mechanics a characteristic property of the field is the potential energy, which is regarded as a continuous function of the coordinates. Both in the classical field theory and in the theory of relativity we must regard the particles as the cause of the field, pro- vided we define a cause as an event that regularly precedes another in a physically 15</page><page sequence="5">ETC.: A RE VIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS well defined manner. The particles are the 'cores of the field, and any motion of these cores, or any change in them, is later manifested in the field properties. If the cores are neutralized, as, for in- stance, by the junction of positive and negative charges, the external field is progressively dissipated as radiation. The cores can hence be regarded as the sources' of the field, and a field without sources of some sort is regarded as un- thinkable. In the further development of the gen- eral theory of relativity the distinction between particles and their fields has tended to disappear. The possibility of a fusion of fields and particles is well de- scribed by Einstein and Inf eld,1 who have given an excellent description of the de- velopment of the field concept. In such a fusion, however, the field tends to be- come the sole governing agency, and then we find it difficult to understand how the particles have come into existence and why their high energy concentration does not cause them to explode on the slight- est provocation. The authors write (pp. 257-258) : 'We cannot build physics on the basis of the matter concept alone. . . . Could we not reject the concept of mat- ter and build a pure field physics? . . . There would be no place, in our new physics, for both field and matter, field being the only reality. . . . Our ultimate problem would be to modify our field laws in such a way that they would not break down for regions in which the energy is enormously concentrated. . . . The decision, as to whether it is possible to carry it out, belongs to the future.' In the following we shall see how, in gen- eral terms, at least, such a program can be carried out; what is the origin of the particles and what role they play; and xTke Evolution of Physics, Simon and Schuster, 1938. what are the general consequences of such a theory. II Our knowledge of matter and fields is mostly based on observations of large- scale phenomena, and our theories have been developed primarily to represent such phenomena. For instance, the idea of identifiable bodies moving in continu- ous paths independent of any observation is inherent in the classical theory. When attempts were made to apply this idea to processes involving individual particles and transfers of small amounts of energy, it was found that this simple picture of motion was not applicable. It appeared that both light-beams and moving elec- trons had a particle aspect and a wave aspect, the former associated with the mass and the energy involved, the latter describing the place and time of their ap- pearance as well as certain directional and vibrational properties. The only satis- factory theory for the elementary proc- esses was based on the ideas character- istic for the quantum theory, that energy always appears as indivisible units de- pending only upon an associated fre- quency, and that the place and time of its appearance can only be predicted with a certain degree of probability. Large- scale phenomena must therefore be as- sumed to be governed by statistical laws, but since in general we are dealing with a large number of particles, these laws are, for most practical purposes, rigorous. Although the dual aspect of matter and of radiation is now familiar to all phy- sicists, it has not been properly empha- sized that this dualism cannot be recon- ciled either with our classical ideas about particles as the sources of force fields, or with the idea of fields as guiding par- ticles in continuous motion, whatever be the sources of the field, or with that of a 16</page><page sequence="6">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD simple fusion of particles and fields, as mentioned above. For instance, the dif- fraction of an electron beam reflected by a metallic crystal shows that the 'thing' reflected does not consist of indivisible particles and does not itself carry any energy as such. Instead, it must be re- garded as a field having a coherent struc- ture in space and time defining the prob- ability that energy in observable form will appear at a given place and at a given time.2 The diffraction can only be ex- plained by assuming that the interfering parts of the wave system contain time ele- ments originating in the same emission process, since these are of very short dura- tion and cannot have mutually dependent phase relations. It is evidently incorrect to say that electrons are emitted as such, since they do not travel as identifiable objects through space at definite speeds. It should be noted that the whole physical space, in the usual method of representa- tion, is needed to represent the prob- ability structure of each of them, an idea familiar from other problems dealing with systems containing many electrons. The probability pattern or field ele- ment associated with an individual emis- sion process has a structure the meshes of which, as in the case of electro-mag- netic radiation, have a size or wave length depending upon its velocity relative to the observer who measures the properties of the field. The field of an electron that appears to be almost stationary relative to the observer possibly has no observable meshes, only a structure of spherical or, for a spinning electron, axial symmetry. This electrostatic field should not be re- garded as being caused by a 'little par- ticle' at its center, imparting peculiar 1 A detailed description of this and other types of coherence is given in my article, 'Co- herence in the Physical World,' Philosophy of Science , IX, 323, October, 1942. properties to the surrounding space by some mysterious mechanism nobody has ever been able to explain or understand. We may say that the field element defines, for different regions, the chance of ob- serving an 'electron in action.' Since a stationary field has only one point where the probability is a maximum, we may picture the associated electron as emerg- ing, if it emerges at all, close to but not necessarily at the geometrical center of the field. The probability structure asso- ciated with an individual electron emis- sion' forms an integral, coherent field unit in which the sum total of probabilities is unity. In the present field theory the in- divisibility of particles is regarded as a necessary consequence of the existence of integral field units defining units of prob- ability structures. A satisfactory feature of the present theory is that electrons which do nothing else than travel from one place to another in our mental pictures are eliminated as unobservables. Carrying this thought further we arrive at the conclusion that continuous motion is a mental abstraction that has no exact counterpart in the realm of physical measurements. For individ- ual particles, motions are derived from events separated by finite space and time intervals. (This applies also to electron tracks in a Wilson cloud chamber, as shown in the last mentioned article.2) Applied to composite bodies, motion has statistical significance only. The product of the wave length of a field unit and its associated momentum, and also of the observed energy amount and the inverse value of the frequency, which itself can be regarded as a measure of duration of the emergence, all measured by a par- ticular observer using 'tools' (atoms, light) built of similar field units, equals the quantum of action. Its finite size puts an upper limit to the accuracy of his 17</page><page sequence="7">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS measurements of position and velocity of the particle. This is the essence of the Principle of Uncertainty. The present theory gives quantitatively the same re- sult, but it also tells us that the concept of motion should not be applied to the particles themselves, which are regarded as ephemeral, energy-carrying indicators of the field structure and not as identifi- able bodies in continuous motion. The same idea can be applied to ordi- nary radiation and gives a good under- standing of the wave nature and particle nature of light. Also in this case the thing emitted consists of a system of integral, coherent structures, which can be de- scribed as wave motions. Each of these field units determines the probability that, at a given place and at a given time, a definite amount of energy and linear and angular momentum - properties which, if highly localized, we habitually regard as characteristic of a particle, in this case called a photon - will be absorbed. If no absorption occurs, the coherent structure associated with an individual emission process expands in an ever widening sur- face with a certain thickness defined by the length of the wave train. This is strikingly shown when we observe the interference of two beams of light from a distant star. The two interfering beams, although separated in space by many feet and travelling over enormous distances, contain time elements having their origin in the same atom and in the same emission process . This can be immediately deduced from the facts that the two beams have fixed phase relations and that the indi- vidual emission processes are of very short duration.8 The probability struc- ture due to such a process instantaneously disappears as a whole, whatever its size may be, when the full energy it controls is absorbed by an atom. If we regard such structures as nothing else than ab- stract mathematical probabilités, there is nothing strange in this, and a mathemat- ical physicist may be completely satisfied with such a picture. But probability is a highly complex mathematical construct, and as such cannot travel from one place to another. It is natural to regard a prob- ability as being carried' or 'caused' by an underlying, active entity of which we have only an incomplete knowledge. The instantaneous disappearance of an enormously extended probability structure suggests strongly that our ordinary idea about separation and motion is highly artificial and that a more 'natural' repre- sentation should be adopted. Such a rep- resentation is offered by the space-time manifold of the relativity theory. Ex- pressed in space-time intervals the separa- tion between a radiating atom and the field unit it emits remains zero, and the field unit does not expand at all. Since the interferometer is used to measure the position of something (loci of maximum probability, usually called wave crests) travelling with the speed of light, the length in space-time of the interferometer base is also zero. The coherent field unit emitted in a radiation process can be regarded as a representative part of the electronic en- velope of the emitting atom. Instead of saying that a photon has been emitted by one atom and hits another, we might say that an integral portion of the field structure of the emitting atom is temp- orarily 'in contact' with an atomic field, • Cf. 'Coherence in the Physical World,' loc. cit. Dr. F. Zwicky has called my attention to the fact that in induced radiation several atoms can emit radiation with fixed phase relations. Since the primary impulse comes from a single atom, the origin of the coherence can even in this case be traced to a single emission process, the other atoms acting, so far as phase relations are concerned, as reflecting mirrors. 18</page><page sequence="8">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD and an incorporation of the whole field unit with its coherent wave system can take place. This occurs especially when the two atoms have similar structures, so that a field unit from one atom fits into the structure of the other. Such a phenomenon we call absorption of radi- ant energy. It might be pointed out that the reason we think of radiation as travel- ling through space at a definite speed is associated with an intrinsic characteristic of the human consciousness, namely of experiencing the world' as time sections and not in its true aspect as a space-time manifold. If we think in terms of the latter the difficulty of understanding, action at a distance can be eliminated. When we see a distant star, integral por- tions of its atoms of long ago are in con- tact with nerve ends in the retina of our eyes, and through nerve fibers with optic ganglia and with our brain, and a contact is established with our perceiving mind. Ill It is clear from what we have just said that in the case of those fields, which we ordinarily describe as electron beams and radiation, it would be incorrect to say that the electrons or the photons are the cause' of the fields or that they are 'sources' defining the structure of the fields. This follows directly from the facts that the idea of moving particles leads to logical contradictions and that a field determines the location of particles and not vice versa. In the first decade after Bohr's theory of atomic structure was enunciated we used to think of electrons moving about the atomic nuclei in discrete orbits. It was later found that this simple model must be abandoned and should be replaced by another describing an energy pattern with sharply defined energy levels, and that the pattern itself could be de- scribed mathematically as a vibrating sys- tem. It cannot be too strongly empha- sized that this vibrating system does not consist of moving particles or of a vibrat- ing body, but is simply a convenient mathematical representation of a prob- ability structure of the same type as that needed to characterize electron beams. The logical impossibility of regarding an electron beam as caused by moving par- ticles applies equally well to the energy pattern around an atomic nucleus. Par- ticles are descriptive terms applicable to observable events in space-time. These events are in general highly localized in space as well as in time and involve defi- nite amounts of mass and energy, and it is for these reasons that in many cases we can describe them as ephemeral par- ticles. We can apply the same reasoning to atomic nuclei. The heavier nuclei are identifiable bodies, which in a certain sense can be 'labeled.' That an atomic nucleus can be regarded as a probability pattern or energy pattern, similar to the structures describing the electronic envel- opes surrounding them, is clearly shown in the case of radioactive elements. We are therefore justified in stating that the properties of atomic nuclei are not due to any elementary particles residing or moving inside the nuclei, but to an in- herent energy pattern the structure of which can to a certain extent be deduced from a study of certain events observable as a momentary emergence of definite amounts of energy and momentum. (In this case the idea of emergence of definite energy amounts, determined by the struc- ture of a probability pattern, appears per- fectly natural. The present theory im- plies a more general application of this idea.) It is often stated that the probability patterns or wave systems described repre- 19</page><page sequence="9">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS sent our knowledge of past events and can be used to predict future events with cer- tain degrees of probability. The knowl- edge acquired gradually loses its value for prediction as time goes on, suddenly to become exact knowledge (that is, as exact as nature will permit) when a new ob- servation is made. According to this theory the coherent wave systems are creations of our mind and have no more objective reality than a wave of optimism spreading over the country/ The wave systems of which we have spoken have definite space and time properties, how- ever, which give them practically the same degree of truth value as that of most other statements concerning the physical world. It is easily seen that they are of exactly the same nature as the radio waves that often precede the wave of optimism. Radio-active phenomena show clearly that our picture of the structure of an atomic nucleus does not depend upon our knowl- edge or ignorance of previous emission processes or upon the accuracy with which such processes have been measured. Al- though the structure of atoms is a creation of the human mind, it is not an arbitrary creation. It has a truth value of a special type, and the truth it represents is, as always, incomplete. It represents a partial aspect of nature, mirrored in a mind of a particular type that is trained to think along certain lines. The full truth de- scribing what goes on in the atomic nuclei, as in other physical processes, is not revealed by any observations of the type used in our laboratories and prob- ably does not belong to the world of space and time with which physics is alone concerned. But more about this later. Summarizing, we may say that force fields should not be regarded as being caused by any particles, but are autono- mous entities built of indivisible, coherent units defining probabilities in space and time. The particles are nature's own evanescent indicators of the fine structure of preexisting fields and are associated with emergence of definite amounts of energy into the physical world of space and time. Atoms and matter in general are not aggregates of particles, but can best be described as energy patterns de- fining the amount, the vector properties, and the probable place of the emergent energy at a given time. Potential energy and probability of emergence of energy are almost synonymous concepts. (The problem of the origin of the energy- carrying indicators and of the field struc- tures will be discussed later.) A simple illustration may help us to get a clearer picture of the new ideas. We are used to think of an electric current in a wire as being due to electrons mov- ing predominantly in one direction, the flow being the result of forces due to a potential difference. The characteristics of the field are assumed, at least to some extent, to be due to the inherent proper- ties of the moving charges, which are considered the actual cause of the field. In the autonomous-field theory there are no moving electrons, and there are no visible sources of the field, visibility be- ing regarded as a consequence of the properties of certain fields. The strength of an electric current is determined by the number of integral field units pass- ing a cross section of the wire per unit of time. As in atoms, a potential differ- ence is a measure of the number of the energy levels separating two energy states. Each field unit has its own extension of the same type as that we usually associate with a moving electron. These field ele- ments carry no energy, only probabilities. To change the probability structure into observable properties, mass, in the form of 'squirts' of energy of fixed amounts, 20</page><page sequence="10">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD must enter and annul the structure. Only then and thus can be demonstrated the existence of what we call an electric cur- rent and its field. (As in the case of light, we might say that the emergence of action entails the disappearance of the corresponding 'action cells/ This cor- respondence between energy and prob- ability structure secures the conservation of energy, not for each instant, but dur- ing finite time intervals.) It is easily seen that, in spite of their unfamiliarity, these ideas give in many ways a more satisfactory picture of an electric current than that involving mov- ing particles and the fields directly at- tributed to them. Impedencies have the dimension of angular momenta. Resist- ance is measured by the number of action units irreversibly transferred to the atoms of the resistor. Inductance has the di- mension of a moment of inertia and acts like a flywheel spinning around the con- ductor carrying the current. A capacity is represented by the number of field units compressed in the condenser plates and the dielectric by unit voltage. The idea of integral field units determining the emergence of definite units of energy, as well as the particle aspect and wave aspect of matter and electricity, are all explicitly expressed in the picture. The last two appear, not as usual as alternative aspects, never to be applied in conjunc- tion, but as concomitants with a definite causal relationship. Since an electric cur- rent is here pictured as a coherent prob- ability pattern, it follows that a more ac- curate form of Ohm's law should con- tain definite phase relations. We can therefore expect interference phenomena when an electric current is divided and enters at several points on the surface of a perfectly uniform conductor, e.g., a metallic crystal at very low temperature. IV The theory of the autonomy or pri- macy of all force fields is of fundamental importance in physics. Its most immedi- ate importance, however, lies in the fact that it can be directly applied to certain fundamental problems in biology. A new factor is then introduced into this science, and many hitherto completely inex- plicable phenomena appear in a new light. Even the age-old problem of the relation- ship between mind and matter is no longer insoluble and will ultimately take its appropriate place in a revitalized science. If we ask what it is that determines the structure of an organism, the answer us- ually given is that in the germ cells of the animals and plants are certain chem- ical substances of a highly complex type, which determine the future development. Some of these substances (nucleo pro- teins) can be traced to the nuclei of the germ cells, and specifically to the chromosomes that undoubtedly carry many of the hereditary characteristics of the organism in a latent form. Some of these substances occur as indivisible units called genes, which are situated in the chromosomes and reproduced in cell di- vision when the chromosomes are split and re-formed. The direct connection between the morphogenetic factors in the cells and the physical development of the organism is still unknown. Transplanta- tion experiments made during the early gastrula stage show that organizing fac- tors can be transferred from one part of an embryo to another. Of special interest in our study is the fact that certain organic tissues, even when killed, can induce, or rather initiate, cell differentiation. In short, it is stated that the origin of form and function in organisms can be traced to chemical substances, some of which 21</page><page sequence="11">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS are of a relatively simple type and can be regarded as releasing dormant qualities in the cells of which living matter is built. Since in all atomic and molecular struc- tures distance effects are supposed to be due to electric fields, the conclusion com- monly drawn is that organization in the living world is due to such fields, and, what is more important, that the proper- ties of the fields are ultimately determined by the configuration and motion of elec- trically charged particles arranged in stable structures. As long as electric fields were regarded as the only effective cause of motion (gravitational fields being too weak to be of importance) and as long as electric fields were supposed to be 'anchored' in particles, this explanation was the only one that could be reconciled with our classical field concepts. It was soon real- ized, however, that ordinary physical fields were completely inadequate to explain the observed facts. A more general field concept was therefore introduced by sev- eral prominent biologists to explain or- ganization. H. Spemann, A. Gurwitsch, P. Weis, De Beer, and Huxley4 have all envisaged organizing fields in the de- veloping embryos, although in most cases the ideas are descriptive rather than ex- planatory. Gurwitsch 5 is most explicit. He states that The place of the embryonal formative process is a field (in the usage of the physicists) the boundaries of which, in general, do not coincide with those of the embryo but surpass them. Embryogenesis, in other words, comes to pass inside of the field. . . . What is given to us as a living system would consist of the visible embryo (or egg, respectively) and a field. . . . The question is how the field itself evolves during the develop- ment of the embryo.' Several years earlier Hans Driesch in his Giff ord Lectures of 1907 and 1908 had developed similar ideas. In describ- ing the fields he used the Aristotelian term entelechy' which he supposed to have nonphysical as well as physical pro- perties. Driesch's theory was unacceptable to biologists, partly because it was 'tainted' with vitalism and partly because everybody was convinced that all fields were completely determined by atomic configurations. The idea of an organizing field inde- pendent of atomic structures and extend- ing beyond the boundaries of an embryo has recently been given strong support from the work of the Section of Neuro- Anatomy of the Yale Medical School. Burr and Northrop 6 proposed in 1935 the 'electro- dynamic theory of life.' This theory induced Burr, Lane and Nims to construct the 'vacuum-tube microvolt- meter,' 7 an instrument particularly suited for the study of the fine structure of the electric fields around animals and plants. By this method 'it has been possible to explore the electrical properties of a wide variety of living forms undisturbed by changes in resistance in the organism and without disturbing in any significant way the inherent electrical properties of the thing measured.' Many important facts have been established by this group of workers. It is sufficient here to state that the electric gradients are not chaotic, but exist in a well-defined pattern character- 4 A summary of these field concepts is found in Spemann's excellent book: Embryonic De- velopment and Induction, Chapter XV, Yale Univ.

In some cases it has been defi- nitely shown that the pattern extends be- yond the organism. At death the field disappears. Burr 8 writes that 'it is hard to escape the conclusion that the electrical pattern is primary and in some measure at least determines the morphological pattern.' The fields studied are called electric because they can be detected by electrical measuring instruments and apparently can influence the motion of electrically charged molecules (ions) . But these fields obviously must be of a type quite differ- ent from those associated with a combi- nation of atoms of the chemical elements and called chemical substances. It is in- conceivable that such substances, however complex they may be, can be responsible for the organization in living matter. A characteristic feature of living organisms is their stability of structural details, and, in animals in particular, the stability of the pattern of organization of parts with definite functions. This stability is di- rectly shown by the unchanging forms in a long series of generations. Fluid chem- ical substances of the type with which we are dealing (e.g. proteins) are in gen- eral highly unstable. In the theory of the autonomous field, stability is a char- acteristic of a field structure and cannot be attributed to any particular configura- tion of particles. For instance, the fields which define the properties of atomic nuclei usually have a very high stability, formerly described as an immutability of chemical elements. We know now, from a study of radioactive phenomena and of artificial transmutation of chemical ele- ments, that atomic nuclei with different degrees of instability exist. Similarly, the fields associated with organization have different degrees of stability, a fact mani- fested by the existence of mutations and the emergence of modified living forms. When it is considered that certain parts of living systems, at least in man and in the higher animals, must be regarded as carriers of or at least associated with a consciousness, as is the cortex of our brain, the idea of chemical substances being .responsible for organization and function appears absurd to many people. Such substances furnish the necessary energy, however, and often exert a trig- ger effect. For convenience I have used the term living fields' as a more general term than organizing fields' and 'embryonic fields.'9 A simple case of an integral living field is offered by the transformation of a blastula into a gastrula. It is known that in this case the cells passively follow a field of force extending over the whole embryo, and that, when a part of the gas- trula is transplanted into new surround- ings, it may for a time continue to change its shape in the way it started to do. The latter phenomenon shows that living fields can be 'cut' without immediately losing their inherent properties. The problem of the reproduction of living fields by splitting has been discussed else- where.10 When we say that force fields are au- tonomous we mean that they are not caused by particles, like electrons and pro- tons. It is obviously difficult to picture a field which can not be attributed to 8 'Field Properties of the Developing Frog's Egg/ Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., XXVII, No. 6, 280, 1941. 9 A detailed description of the properties of such fields is given in my book, The Soul of the Universe , David McKay Company, Philadel- phia, 1940. This book also describes in simple terms many of the ideas here mentioned and the scientific facts which support the same. 10 'The Physical and the Non-Physical World and their Intermediate Elements/ Scientific Monthly, LIV, 71, January, 1942. 23</page><page sequence="13">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS something else. We naturally look for a cause of the field ; something beyond the observable effects. This something' must be of a very profound nature, since it must in some way or other be associated with the ultimate origin of energy, mat- ter, life, and mind. It is customary to use the term 'sources' as denoting the origin of force fields, and I have used the term 'living sources' to designate the sources of the living fields. Such sources of infinitesimal size exist in the germ cells, and, when the sources expand, each of them becomes an integral living field with a definite and effective structure. In my earlier publications I regarded the particles themselves as the sources of the atomic and the molecular fields. This is only partly correct, since the particles are momentary sources of energy, but they are not the cause of the field structures. Although the heavier particles of matter define the center of a field with high ac- curacy, the wave nature of these particles shows that they define, not the exact geo- metrical centers of fields, but regions with statistical properties. In searching for the cause of force fields we realize immedi- ately that an important element is missing in the theory. V The missing element is furnished by the introduction of the non-physical world. In the last mentioned article 10 I have given the reasons for the assumption of the existence of such a world. Our dis- tinction between a physical and a non- physical world can be traced to the fact that we observe nature by different sense organs, the physical world being based on our organs of vision and of touch. The non-physical world is everywhere contiguous with the physical world of space and time, a notion familiar from modern geometry of many dimensions. But the new 'dimension* cannot have space properties, that is, it cannot be measured as intervals and structures, al- though incipient spatio-temporal, that is, physico-chemical, properties associated with vital functions can be determined at the points where it comes into contact with or emerges into the physical world of space and time. These contact points I have called intermediate elements, and they are the connecting links between the physical and the non-physical world as pictured in our type of consciousness. It is through these contact points that energy, organization, and mind temporarily enter into the world of space and time. In space-time they appear as physical fields built of elementary field units and ob- servable as atoms and matter, plants and animals, nerve cells and integrated nerve systems with brains, respectively. In the autonomous-field theory the corpuscular nature of matter, the interference of light, the diffraction of particles, and the exis- tence of structural elements and of an integrated organization in living organ- isms, are all regarded as evidence of dif- ferent kinds of indivisible field units. The astonishingly small size of the intrinsically enormously complicated organizing fac- tors in the germ cells is a natural conse- quence of the fact that they emerge from a world to which our ordinary space con- ceptions are not applicable. In his book The New Background of Science (Macmillan, 1933), Sir James Jeans has expressed a very similar idea. He writes on page 259: 'We are thus led conjecturally to think of space and time as a sort of outer surface of nature, like the surface of a deep flowing stream. The events which affect our senses are like ripples on the surface of this stream, but their origins - the material objects - throw 24</page><page sequence="14">THE AUTONOMOUS FIELD roots deep down into the stream.' 11 By a study of different types of living fields we can obtain some idea of the characteristics of the non-physical world. In the paper 10 mentioned I have studied the living fields responsible for the struc- ture of optic ganglia in the retina, a study which gives us a clue to the origin of our sensation of colors. We shall here study another type of living fields that gives us information about another aspect of the non-physical world. The shape and struc- ture of muscles from the standpoint of the present theory must be regarded as due to living fields. A muscle is a fluid struc- ture, and it has no great rigidity when dead. Its changes in shape and in rigidity, both important characteristics of an au- tonomous field, are often associated with nerve impulses. The coherent and rhyth- mic contraction of the heart muscle, for instance, indicates the existence of a liv- ing field of unitary character. The pulse is determined by certain nodal nerve cells connected to the brain by the vagus nerve. The pulsation can be stimulated by cer- tain chemicals like adrenaline. Excised portions of heart tissue can be kept alive, and the individual cells will pulsate under certain conditions. The nerve connections in the heart are necessary for a coherent pulsation of the heart as a whole and should therefore be regarded as a visual manifestation of the links in a more gen- eral field than those exhibited by the individual cells. Whatever conception we have of how the heart has been developed in the animal world, there can be no 11 W. F. G. Swann, in his book The Archi- tecture of the Universe (MacMillan, 1934), describes on page 415 how, two worlds could be connected by linkage of certain types. These linkages correspond to my 'intermediate ele- ments/ In several of his publications, Dr. Swann has expressed ideas about the nature of particles which are somewhat similar to those expressed in this paper. doubt that, at present, it performs a very essential function in certain animals, and that its motions and structure, linked as it is with the arteries, veins, and capil- laries, are admirably adapted to perform this particular function. We may well say that the heart exhibits a purposeful action although we are not consciously aware of its purpose, which we have known for only a relatively short time. This obser- vation indicates that one of the character- istics of the non-physical world is pur- poseful activity . Another indication of the same thing is offered by those muscles the activities of which are associated with a conscious mil. In a consistent materialistic school of thought there can be no place for a will, as an independent and effective agency. Adherents to this school there- fore claim that will is an epiphenomenon that accompanies certain muscular activi- ties, but not others. This, however, is con- trary to our experience, since we are well aware of a will, or at least a desire to do something, without the will being ac- companied by any appreciable muscular action. In other words, the will does not seem to accompany muscular activities, and it certainly does not follow them. In- stead, all our experience tells us that it precedes them, and it can therefore well be regarded as the cause of action. Ac- cording to the autonomous-field theory, the living field in our nervous system is modified and directed by something in our own consciousness which we call will, a process which does not by itself intro- duce any added energy into the muscle. Since will does not have any space proper- ties, it belongs not to the physical but to the non-physical world, although it is in intimate association with the field struc- ture. Again we find that in the non- physical world there is a -purpose, which we perceive as will when it originates or 25</page><page sequence="15">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS ¿appears in our consciousness. Whether or not the will is free to act is a question that cannot be answered, because we can- not trace mental activities to their ulti- mate origin. The only thing we can say about its origin is that it cannot be located in material particles, although these pro- vide the energy necessary for its physical manifestations. These ideas are in complete harmony with those expressed recently by R. S. Lillie. He regards living systems as 'psy- chophysical,' that is, they are assumed to have both physical and psychological characteristics. I quote from one of his articles 12 entitled 'Living Systems and Non-Living Systems' : 'In the adult animal (e.g. a man) the functioning of the whole organism as a biologically well adapted unity is demonstrably dependent in large part on psychological factors. It is true that these have their physiological cor- relates. Nevertheless, such general facts remind us, whenever we are inclined to forget, of the special character of the living organism as not merely a physical but a psychophysical system; and they show the scientific insufficiency of a purely physical conception of the living organ- ism.' If we accept the idea that all organisms have psychological as well as physical properties, will may play a much more important part in the development of the living world than we have thought.13 Although this will only reaches our consciousness in special cases when the proper nerve connections are present, we can still regard it as an active force, provided we accept the theory of the autonomy of force fields. But since we do not know to what degree, if any, our will is 'free,' we cannot answer the question whether the will, whose effects we perceive, is that of the individual or of a more general cosmic will.' Person- ally I believe it is a combination of both. In conclusion we can say, that the theory of the autonomy of force fields leads to the result that such fields can be analyzed into integral, coherent units, and that this theory then makes it possible to understand many phenomena which the classical field theory is unable to explain. Principal among these phenomena are the wave nature and particle nature of mat- ter and radiation and the small-scale and the large-scale organization in the living world. The theory has been shown to be a natural consequence of modern wave mechanics. It is also in harmony with re- cent discoveries in biology and gives us a new concept of life. It is directly op- posed to the mechanical concepts which have until recently characterized natural science. It points directly to a world in- timately connected with our own con- sciousness. a Philosophy of Science, IX, 319-320, 1942. See also his latest article 'Vital Organization and the Psychic Factor,' Philosophy of Science, XI, 161, 1944. In these and previous articles Professor Lillie has emphatically expressed the opinion that the organization in the living world cannot be reconciled with ordinary phys- ical laws. The autonomous-field theory de- veloped from an attempt to explain the organi- zation in the living world and at the same time to understand the origin of consciousness. "Cf.
