Living in England in the mid-1970s and reading The Times Literary Supple ment, one could not help feeling that somehow the London intellectuals were treating Russia as much as if not more than a part of Western Europe's cultural map as France or Germany, and, in fact, at times Moscow seemed to receive much more coverage on its review pages than Paris, Munich, or certainly Dublin. At that time, it was not at all the case in this country—for geographic or any other reasons, but this is all changing now. The Superfluous Man in Russian Letters by the Clardys concerns itself with one of the cornerstones of classical Russian literature. The term "superfluous man" became a trademark and a yardstick in Russian prose and poetry. The book traces the development of the type, or rather the character, from Pushkin early in the last century to Sinyavsky, who writes in Paris now. Each chapter contains a concise biography of the writers in question, providing enough infor mation for a beginner in Russian Studies. The first chapter deals appropriately with Pushkin's Eugene Onegin and Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, the two textbook examples of the superfluous man. The thrust of the authors' argument is that whereas Onegin remains within the boundaries of morality, Pechorin does not. The second chapter, on Gon charov and Turgenev, aptly and sensitively deals with "oblomovism," Oblomov being a superfluous man par excellence. Here the authors laudably differ from most critics, including themselves elsewhere in the book, noting that Zachar, Oblomov's servant, is as superfluous as his master and thus diverting us, at least temporarily, from the popular conviction that the superfluous men in Russian literature have always belonged to the privileged classes (some of them who did were actually poor—for example, Turgenev's Rudin). The second part of this chapter is, however, somewhat thin in material. Although it is true that Turgenev's Diary of a Superfluous Man coined the name for the type, some analysis of Lavretzky in The Nest of Gentlefolk and of Pavel Petrovich in Fathers and Sons would undoubtedly enhance the reader's understanding of the way Turgenev, the first émigré classic in Russian letters, 412 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="2">viewed the problem of the superfluous man, considered by the Russian critics of that time to be a product of the stagnant society. As the authors note in conclu sion (p. 162), people like Onegin, Pechorin, and Oblomov were the best their generations had to offer—they had sensitivity but lacked a purpose. The gallery of the superfluous men continues through Gogol, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy to Chekhov and Gorky (Chapters 3 through 7), and this is where an important split occurs which the Clardys register but fail to do justice to. Gorky was the writer who introduced the idea of the "positive hero," a man with both sensitivity and purpose, ready to fight for his ideas, a man who subse quently replaced the superfluous man and took over as the protagonist in the post-Gorky Russian literature of this century. The dogma of socialist realism re quires a characteristic division of the superfluous man's traits, polarized in the process—his egotism and uselessness go to the "negative hero," whereas his positive counterpart inherits the superfluous man's sensitivity and basic decency. This is why it is highly questionable whether Solzhenitsyn's heroes can be added to the gallery of superfluous men. Solzhenitsyn is dealt with in thorough and minute detail in two chapters—8 and 9 (which look somewhat unbalanced when compared with half a chapter each for Pushkin and Turgenev). The in depth analysis of August 1914, with which one cannot find much fault, clearly demonstrates the split and polarization of the superfluous man's traits, and the only difference between Solzhenitsyn and the prorevolutionary writers such as Ostrovsky, Fadeev, or Libedinsky (with whom, incidentally, Solzhenitsyn shares a fierce belief in Russia's messianic future) is that the latter's "revolutionary saint vs. antirevolutionary devil" is switched by Solzhenitsyn into "antirevolutionary saint vs. revolutionary devil." This polarized pattern, whether "straight" or "reverse," makes Solzhenitsyn largely irrelevant for a discussion of the superfluous man. In the Russian search for an ideal, the superfluous man was the one who negated the current values, rebelling either by total passivity or by self-destruction but never embracing any political, religious, moral, or other faith —that part is now left to the positive hero. It is Synyavsky (Tertz) on whom it actually befalls to continue the tradition of the superfluous man in Russian letters. The concentration of self in his short story "You and I" is the twentieth-century Pechorin who has grown with time out of his egotism and constant self-awareness, influenced by a constant existen tial search for authenticity. Straustin in "Graphomaniacs," with his dreams, his world of illusion and self-delusion, his combination of kindness and coarseness, might be Oblomov's great-grandson. Sinyavsky's use of the fantastic is derived from the traditions of Gogol, on whom he wrote an excellent monograph; and, as the authors note, "Sinyavsky made his plea for his own right to be superfluous" (p. 150). To say as the authors do that "superfluous man emerged as a result of too much affluence, too much leisure, too much idle time for the children of the privileged class in Tsarist Russian society," that "the superfluous man was vain, on the one hand, having no real value or significance in his society and, on the other hand, having an excessively high regard for himself," and that "he was the effete end of a line worn out, spent and sterile, no longer capable of producing" (p. 160) may be basically correct but is also a gross oversimplification. If the RECENT BOOKS-CONTINENTAL 413</page><page sequence="3">superfluous man were just that, for countless Russian readers Oblomov would not have become a symbol of gentleness; Pechorin, of elegance; and Onegin (of the last chapter), of passion. These heroes were undoubtedly failures, but they had a great deal of charm, and nobody has ever fallen in love with their un superfluous counterparts such as Stolz or Grushnitzky. Because the book consists primarily of the writers' biographies and plots, it can be used as a useful introductory textbook, but it would have profited from some more careful proofreading. Solzhenitsyn: The Moral Vision by Edward E. Ericson, Jr., is an earnest and thorough effort to present the writer's work to the Western audience. Ericson is not trying to correct the misperception for which he is not responsible, namely that Solzhenitsyn is the greatest Russian literary figure of the century (and there is nothing unique about this—very similarly, Oscar Wilde and Jack London, for instance, are perceived abroad as much more famous authors than they really are in their native England and America, respectively). Ericson should know bet ter, however, than to perpetuate the myth of the absolute uniqueness of the writer's personal fate (p. 1)—in fact, there is a long Russian tradition of simultaneous glorification of the best poets and writers by the reading public and vilification by the Establishment, no matter whether Tsarist or Soviet. Radishchev, Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Mandelshtam, and Akhmatova have all gone through this in one form or another. The eight central chapters of the book, 2 through 9, offer a faithful ac count of Solzhenitsyn's various writings, grouped thematically and generically rather than chronologically. There is much more discussion of the plots and characters than literary criticism per se, and it is interspersed with largely ac curate and helpful historical comments and explanations. One thing the author fails to emphasize is the numerous overlaps between Solzhenitsyn's ideology, philosophy, and aesthetics, on the one hand, and the teachings of the Party, which he seems to repudiate, on the other. Thus, there is a clear correlation between the first section of the Nobel lecture (Chapter 1) and the standard Soviet denunciation of "pure art" or "art for art's sake." The book obviously profited from the author's decision to devote separate chapters to The First Circle, Cancer Ward, August 1974 and Lenin in Zurich, which was planned originally as part of August, and The Gulag Archipelago. One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, however, deserved a separate chapter, too, and it loses somewhat from being paired with a much less significant work, The Love Girl and the Innocent (Chapter 4). The early, heavily flawed and largely unknown play, The Candle in the Wind, on the other hand, does not need a separate chapter, even if the shortest one in the book. In Chapter 10 Ericson laments the fact that it is "the non-literary works which have received the lion's share of the news media's coverage of Solzhenitsyn and his writing" (p. 178). It is only partially correct, however, to blame this fact on the sensationalism and political bias of the media. In the context of Russian literature the statement and contribution Solzhenitsyn has made are much more political than purely literary. As a Russian writer, Solzhenitsyn's style, tempo, and plot-development are very vulnerable, and in view of that, it is a pity that Ericson fails to praise "Matryona's House" for coming the closest to a literary 414 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="4">masterpiece more worthy of the great tradition it is written in than any other work by Solzhenitsyn. On the whole, it is an informed and informative text, and the Western au dience will find it useful and timely. It is capped with a fair and largely ac curate political assessment of Solzhenitsyn as an "opulent" resident of Vermont. Neither Solzhenitsyn nor his Russian readers would perhaps agree with different parts of this analysis and for different reasons, but the discrepancy in perception is unavoidable and legitimate. Thus, for instance, in Chapter 6 Ericson stops just short of noticing that, while ridiculing the Western liberals easily fooled and crudely used by the Soviet authorities on a prearranged visit to the prison in The First Circle, Solzhenitsyn also rejects the ideals of freedom and humanity those liberals stand for, and this rejection can be traced in most of his political writings, underscored also by a typical bom-again zeal and intolerance which Ericson somewhat charitably confuses with bona fide Russian orthodoxy. Soviet Literature in the 1970's: Artistic Diversity and Ideological Conformity by N. N. Shneidman deals with a period about which not much has been writ ten yet. It is also not an easy task to write about the decade. Khrushchev's "Thaw" of the late 1950s was an ideologically explosive time by Soviet stan dards—it lifted some old taboos and brought a breath of fresh air into the stag nant atmosphere of literature under Stalin. The 1960s came on the heels of the Thaw, bringing new names, new styles, and new hopes, effectively crushed toward the end of the decade by the Soviet troops invading Czechoslovakia. The 1980s promise to be an interesting time because for the second time in this cen tury the Russian literary talent is divided almost evenly between "here" and "there," the former meaning the Soviet Union and the latter "abroad" —Israel, Western Europe, Canada, and this country, where the émigré writers have set tled. The 1970s were, when it all started, a gloomy time, with the hopes crushed and fights lost before they started, and no "human face" any longer in sight. Nearly every writer was making an extremely hard and final decision—to stay or to go. To remain, for an honest writer, meant to keep silent —in order not to lie—on too many important topics. To leave meant to forgo one's public, culture, and language. Toward the middle of the decade the watershed between the two camps was quite obvious. Shneidman deals with those who were firmly entrenched inside Russia. His choice of writers demonstrates a good taste and clear understanding of the contemporary literary process in Russia. Aitmatov, Bondarev, Bykov, Zalygin, Rasputin, and Trifonov are all in their fifties or sixties, all fine crafts men, all trying hard to keep their honesty and integrity under adverse cir cumstances. From this reviewer's point of view, Aitmatov and Trifonov are literary figures of a larger caliber than the rest. Two out of the six write in languages other than Russian (Aitmatov in Kirghiz and Bykov in Byelorussian); two others grew up in Siberia (Rasputin and Zalygin). (Trifonov, who lived all his life in Moscow, just died there.) Each of the six writers has his own theme, and Shneidman's book is organ ized around these themes. One chapter is devoted to Aitmatov, who relies strongly on folk mythology, recurrently uses reverse anthropomorphic images, and delivers a strong underlying ethical message. Aitmatov's talent oversteps the nar row boundaries of provincial or exotic nationalism, and his unfailing good taste RECENT BOOKS-CONTINENTAL 415</page><page sequence="5">produces a fascinating juxtaposition of man, man's history, and forces of nature. The next chapter is devoted to Bondarev and Bykov, both of whom rely on the war theme. Bykov is concerned with the fate of an individual whose ethical values are subjected to a severe test by war's extreme circumstances. Bondarev's circumstances produce more epic prose, with historical and philosophical con cerns. The discussion of the war theme is interesting and well-balanced. The chapters on Zalygin, whose novels on Siberian scientists are traditional in form and reflect an utterly contemporary concern for ecology, and Rasputin, a representative of the pastoral genre à la Russe Moderne, a genre which is becoming increasingly fashionable in Russia, are followed by one on Trifonov, easily one of the best three short-story writers (with Aksyonov and Nagibin) writing in Russian now. His subject matter is the life of Soviet urban intelligent sia; his theme is communication, or rather the lack of it. He continues the tradition of the Russian story developed by Chekhov, Platonov, and Babel, a tradition to which such diverse authors as Katherine Mansfield and Angus Wilson consider themselves heirs. Throughout the book Shneidman demonstrates his understanding of and sympathy for the thinking Russian intellectual who is trying to be true to his talent and to be heard at the same time. The book is a refreshingly solid piece of academic research among the numerous ill-informed or sensational studies in the rapidly growing American Russica.
