From Eternity To Here: Paul Gauguin and The Word Made Flesh Edward D. Powers History or Mystery? I admit that I have, in respect to mystical philosophies, only an unambiguous interest, analogous in practice to that of an uninfatuated psychiatrist toward his patients.1 - Georges Bataille It is rather strange, really, how much of the recent, and of this the very best of the Gauguin literature persistently interrogates the 'authenticity' of his Symbolism-in effect, subjects it to a sort of truth testing as if Symbolism ever purported, or by definition even could have purported, to be empirically true. For Maurice Denis, Symbolism is a movement founded in the 'subjective deformation' of the object: the reproduction of 'emotions or states of the spirit without it being necessary', however, to provide a 'copy of the initial spectacle'.2 While attempts to reconstruct just this empirical, historical or otherwise objective 'copy of the initial spectacle'-which the Symbolist artwork has, to the contrary, 'subjectively deformed'-are not of course wrong, they are nevertheless strange, constituting an unspoken and unaddressed methodological a priori. The results of these researches are stranger still. From Fred Orton and Griselda Pollock, for example, we learn that Gauguin's Brittany could have been little closer to a precocious dress rehearsal of EuroDisney,3 and unsurprisingly, that his 'very rustic, very superstitious'4 Bretons were so, but all the way to the bank. Yet if this is the case, how exactly could Gauguin have painted Brittany, itself a simulacrum, with any greater historical due?-how, in other words, does one paint a canny Breton, and why should we believe Gauguin's are not? More famously, what of the authenticity of Gauguin's Tahiti? As Abigail Solomon-Godeau and others contend,5 in many respects we can simply forget about it. Its walls are writ large with Easter Island glyphs, not from Tahiti of course, but points east, and indecipherable even there. Its populace can be seen inexplicably to 'strike a pose'-'voguing', as Madonna urges-to various bits and pieces of the Javanese temple at Borobudur, now from points west. All the while, these would-be natives perform any variety of mystery plays, all but irretrievably forgotten at home, and instead based on Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout's Voyages aux lles du grand ocean (1837). As unfamiliar in Papeete as Paris, these tales are in turn elucidated by a bubble-text narrator in nothing less, nor a great deal more, than Berlitz Tahitian. Surely the historical truth of any of this would seem beside the point, even without remarking Denis' refusal to 'copy the initial spectacle', let alone Gauguin's seminal disdain of all things empirical, as 'shackles', in favour of 'dreaming'-and producing nature, instead, as abstraction.6 Indeed, I can only imagine Gauguin befuddled by our persistent search for the truth of his Symbolism as if it were an unalloyed photographic referent, one which-exactly as such, as verisimilar and so forth-he flatly disowned.7 Apropos of that failure of photographic transparency, in 'The Imaginary Orient' Linda Nochlin reminds us that there are Orientalists, and then again OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002 87-106 ( OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="2">Edward D. Powers there are Orientalists. Among the latter, she includes the false transparency of Gerome's sweep-up-behind-yourself-as-you-leave North African exotica. Among the former, however, we find not Gerome's stay-at-home cousins, such as Breton or Dagnan-Bouveret, but Gauguin, owing to the formal difference, the self-conscious artfulness, of '[his resort] to flatness, decorative simplification, and references to "primitive art"', as Nochlin argues, together with '[his rejection of] the signifiers of Western rationalism, progress, and objectivity in toto'.8 In the rush to truth test Gauguin's art, it would seem that this significant formal distinction has been lost, and replaced by a sort of lumpen-Orientalism-and with it, a double bind created. For if all painters of the Other are somehow subject to the same methodology, then just as the sort of painting which purports transparently to narrate history, yet does so falsely, we can debunk in kind (by resort to history), so any painting somehow 'of history'-whatever the mirror it claims: fun house or true, 'subjectively deformed' or purportedly objectively determined-we can compare 'to history' in the same way. Established on a model of difference, however, we would notice not only Gauguin's rejection of 'objectivity in toto' as a formal matter, but also its corollary, his rejection of false transparency specifically: the artist's deconstructive presence-the 'I' which, as Nochlin observes, precludes Roland Barthes' 'reality effect'9-that Gauguin forever wears on his sleeve, yet Gerome and his ilk hide up their own. Were we, for example, to run down the strangely compelling, if disconcerting epistemology-as-list recently compiled in a study of National Geographic's photographic 'codes', we would find that every such 'code' which Gauguin deploys in/as the field of the Other, he is as likely to subvert. True, Gauguin's focus is on Polynesia, like Brittany before it, as a 'world of ritual': the Other, as Catherine Lutz and Jane Collins contend, 'portrayed as a ritual performer, embedded (perhaps some would read encrusted) in tradition and living in a sacred (some would say superstitious) world'.1 In his Polynesian works, however, Gauguin leaves just those Occidental footprints in the sand which Orientalism-whose boundaries between us and them, Christian and Infidel, are Checkpoint Charlie-like-paradigmatically never does. Fully permeable on their face, Gauguin's paintings of the Other freely incorporate and disclose his own subjectivity, especially, as Stephen Eisenman argues, 1 the complex subject position created by his perpetual, if self- imposed, exile. Notable in this respect is the Christian thematic Gauguin tellingly integrates into his Polynesian genre scenes, further embedding them in a sacred worjd to be sure, yet more importantly, in one whose very sacredness is palpably exogenous and factitious: a self-conscious product of the artist's own 'subjective deformation' of experience and, at this level, objectively neither true nor false, but historically opaque. In Gauguin's Brittany, on the other hand, although we again find a ritualistic world, this one was a form of self-representation also, knowingly purveyed by the tourist-savvy Bretons themselves, as Orton and Pollock demonstrate. Yet another such code, the focus on indexical dress, is exactly what Gauguin's preference for the Western missionary dress as for the native pareu-and especially for the pareu made of European, rather than native, fabric- consistently does not deliver.12 Indeed, for every lushly verdant Garden of Eden in which Gauguin stages one of his Polynesian idylls, elsewhere we observe a loss of both nature and innocence as well on a colonial-style veranda.13 Thus is any enumeration of Gauguin's 'codes' of the Other as likely to proliferate in either direction as to reduce Gauguin, ultimately, to a flat series of binaries. 8.

But if the paradox of Symbolism is that it most nearly accedes to truth right where it is most fully permeable to the artist's subjectivity,14 Gauguin's was not only a colonial fantasy, with an empirical-desired and desiring-body as referent, but a religious dream also, one whose ultimate referent is less certain, and in any empirical sense entirely uncertain. A striking example of the consequent tendency to mystify Gauguin-ironically, just as he is accused of mystifying the Other-is the scholarly cave of wraith-like meanings, to which Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski consigns Gauguin's exuberant Self-Portrait with Halo (1889) (Fig. 1). According to Jirat-Wasiutynski, in the 1889 self- portrait, Gauguin variously '[frees] himself from the dominance of the "forces of life and death" by learning "to suffer, to renounce and to die"'; 'triumphs over the temptations of feeling, desire, and life'; and ultimately '[presents] himself . . . as a fully realized initiate or magus'.'5 At least since that most unpropitious appearance of His Hand at Belshazzar's Feast, precious few are the divinely revealed summae ever scribbled on a dining-room wall, let alone on the door panel of a Provincetown-style pensione, as the 1889 self-portrait was. Fewer still is that rare breed of exemplum virtutis who, once having conquered worldly darkness and sensuality, as Jirat-Wasiutynski further proposes, would nevertheless-'smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of absinthe . . . an unmixed pleasure which I have every day'-then have his fifteen-year-old 'wife' '[get] down on her back for me whenever I want, all for the modest reward of a frock, worth ten francs a month', as Gauguin writes to Armand Seguin.16 And fewest of all-if we are talking about so thoroughly randy and exhibitionist a Frenchman as Gauguin-those who should so easily vaporise the art as everything the artist, surely, is not; or otherwise essentialise it, as Mark Cheetham does, as glossing the oracular philosophies of a third-century Greek. Admittedly, Cheetham does make a good case, on the face of it, that Neoplatonic concepts of 'Truth', 'Purity', and the like-however sibylline their pronouncement in Plotinus' Enneads- acquired, in Symbolist practice, more grounded, common-sense meanings. 'Purity', for example, is a concept which is also dear to Gauguin, yet one which he associates, not with things 'Greek', as he writes to Charles Morice, but with 'a savage, a wolf in the woods without a collar . . . a landscape with limpid waters; no stain of the civilized human being'.1 In striking contrast to Gauguin's 'return to nature', and especially the 'savage' corporeality he believes it to engender, Plotinus locates 'Purity', not in any immanent physicality, but in a profoundly 'civilised' metaphysics which exactly transcends it.18 (Only muddying the turbid waters of Neoplatonism, G.- Albert Aurier's blithely oxymoronic description of Gauguin as a 'savage Platonist' does little to close the breach.19) Yet the problem of Gauguin's Neoplatonism, like the 'initiate' or 'magus' Jirat-Wasiutynski would make of him, is deeper still. For to arrive at this impossibly more-ascetic-than-thou, corporeally self-abnegating Gauguin, these mystical readings need to dematerialise, in addition to every reality of Gauguin's life, even the physical reality of mysticism itself. Like the magician's assistant into her box, so the alcohol and cigarettes, recurrent illnesses and sexual liaisons, not to mention an entire universe of pecuniary interests, and these not only of the young homme d'affaires, simply vanish. With them, however, so do even the bodily practice and embodied experience of mysticism itself: Plotinus' shame of his own physical existence-no more a purely theoretical matter than his practised vegetarianism, or refusal to go to the public baths0 -which informed his philosophising, and to paraphrase the cliche, made of his abstract preaching, a concrete practice.

In Actes du colloque Gauguin, p. 167, Denise Delouche discusses Gauguin's sources for the wrestlers' 'holds'. has some share in it', as St Teresa famously confesses of her own mystical union with God, 'even a considerable share'.21 Gauguin's Synthetist style, as he explains in the 1880s, is founded in just this impossibility of separating and privileging mind over matter: 'to say that thought is called spirit, whereas the instincts, the nerves, and the heart are part of matter. What irony! The vaguest, the most undefinable, the most varied is precisely matter. Thought is a slave of sensations'.22 Even to the last, Gauguin still contends, 'Thus is the soul constituted, first of all, in the body'.23 Absent this bodily share, as in Jirat- Wasiutynski's and Cheetham's universe of historically decontextualised and physically derealised sound bytes, 'essentially' everything comes to resemble everything else. Even in Gauguin's first major religious picture, Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (1888) (Fig. 2), divine presence is already physically manifest and, in fact, is writ large on the body of the visionary Jacob. Like the next religious subject to which Gauguin would turn the following year-the Passion of Christ, when the sheer physicality of His Incarnation is put to the test-the Breton sport of wrestling, which informs Jacob's own match with the angel,24 is not only profoundly physical, but just like the extensive use Gauguin would make of Breton sculpture of the Passion, as a spectator sport, it is also emphatically 'imagistic'. In both cases, Gauguin substitutes what is divinely revealed for how it is concretely figured, instead, in contemporary reality: whether as the popular entertainment he transports from the banks of biblical Jabbok to the plains of 1880s Brittany, or as the popular Passion sculpture he resurrects the following year. As if proving the truth of the spectacle, Jacob's and the angel's palpable 'holds' on each other-whether as narrated in the bible story,25 or the painting26even serve to test the same fleshy reality which, again, signally differentiates the physical humanity of Christ from the intangible nature of His Divinity. To the near side of Vision's Fig. 2. Paul Gauguin, Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel), 1888, oil on canvas, 73 x 92 cm. National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh.

Powers apple bough, by contrast, the only such 'bodily share' anywhere in evidence is Gauguin's laughing-dancing cow, which not only emulates the dispropor- tionate scale of the wrestlers, but like their own pas de deux, in some sense, is also 'rearing up', as Gauguin says.27 The most unrestrained and dynamically Jacob-like presence among the Breton parishioners, the cow, paradoxically, is also the least phlegmatic. Otherwise, everything to the near side of the apple bough only contributes to the Breton refusal of permeability to physical experience: from the implacable armour of Breton costume- 'two bonnets ... 28 like monstrous helmets', as Gauguin emphasises2-to its pietist mask, as a noncommittal third figure between comedy and tragedy, behind which countenance is wont to withdraw. Thus does the truth of Jacob's vision, as immanent in the physical experience of it, instead withdraw behind the Breton body as a thoroughly mediated and, like its costume, emphatically invented site of performance. If the parishioners' vision of Jacob's own thus constitutes a return of the very physicality they repress (and, for this reason, 'only exist[s] in [their] imagination', as Gauguin says29), so too do they betray the false knowledge-after The Fall, yet absent its 'bodily share'-that the apple tree exactly signifies.30 Ahead or Atop? Man has escaped from his head just as the condemned man has escaped from his prison.31 - Georges Bataille Can it nevertheless be said that Gauguin's early self-portraits do, somehow, exemplify the endlessly additive process mystical readings tend both to discern and at once to proliferate?-whether 'Egyptianising' his Self-Portrait with Halo as a sort of late-day Corpus Hermeticum, as Jirat-Wasiutynski does, or Neoplatonising his early self-portraiture as a subjacent Ennead, as does Cheetham. After all, as Octave Mirbeau so beautifully states the case, 'always emanating from [Gauguin's art] is the bitter and violent smell of the poisons of the flesh ... an unsettling and savory mingling of barbarian splendor, Catholic liturgy, Hindu meditation, Gothic imagery, and obscure and subtle symbolism'.32 Yet Mirbeau alone recognises what, in all this Symbolic metastasis, nevertheless realises infinity even in the finite. For rather than forever steep and thicken, these competing religious symbols are also made to intersect at a common point: if not the 'bitter and violent smell of its poisons', at least the body tout court. Thus, perched Brahma- or Buddha-like on a lotus in his Self-Portrait with Halo, Gauguin represents himself '[emerging] into light from the darkness and sensuality of the phenomenal world'.33 Indeed, with asp 'in hand', even as a still-unplucked apple hangs over his head, the artist at once depicts himself as a sort of pre-lapsarian Adam:34 on the cusp of The Fall to be sure, but not fallen. Hanging in mid-air alike, the carnal apple and incorporate halo even recall the bad angel/good angel said to sit on one's shoulders. In this way, Gauguin's mock-messianic pretensions in the 1889 self-portrait are clear: as halo redeems apple, so Gauguin as the 'Second Adam' (i.e. Christ) redeems the First.35 The painter's Christian eschatology thus testifies to his own (artistic) 'martyrdom', along with the 'good news' he too brings to the (artistic) world, exactly as Gauguin styles himself in a letter to Emile Schuffenecker that year.36 Moreover, the artist's craft redeems painting, just as Christ's humanity redeems man, in both cases, by the signally physical means at their disposal. Gauguin opposes his artistic-as-messianic symbolism, in the 1889 self- portrait, to its pendant, Portrait of Meyer de Haan by Lamplight (1889) (Fig. 3), 27.

Brettell, The Art of Paul Gauguin, p. 127 (n. 9). Beginning at the crown of the forehead, the jug's red glaze thus drips and runs its length, finally congealing into blood-like rivulets at the neck. Rather than a 'decapitated' self-portrait, let alone one in the image of Orpheus' bloodless head, the top-to- bottom pattern the red glaze produces is of the same order as the Crown of Thorns would have produced.

Powers whose Fall-indeed, right into their innkeeper's arms-the apples, now plucked and gathered in a dish, so clearly betray.37 Reinforcing this post- lapsarian Meyer de Haan, Gauguin even includes a copy of Milton's Paradise Lost-'Lost', but only to his Jewish friend who knows no Second Adam-and Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, in which not even a thinly disguised Meyer de Haan/ Diogenes Teufelsdr6ckh-again, knowing no messianic redemption-instead searches by lamplight 'this poor, miserable, hampered, despicable Actual, wherein thou even now standest, here or nowhere is thy ideal'.38 Of course the dialectic established between these pendant portraits is their point: 'this poor, miserable, hampered, despicable Actual' (read phenomenal world) in which the heaven-sent Gauguin so thoroughly immerses the devilish Meyer de Haan is exactly what the messianic artist himself would emerge from, and thence return to the Absolute. Admittedly, this Nietzschean nightmare Gauguin portrays of his 'eternally recurring' self-blossoming out of lotuses as if so many Gardens of Eden, hedging his every theological bet to every compass point alike-would seem to be a question, not of the body, but of the body denied, or sublated perhaps, as spirit. Redeemed and emerged from the sensual miasma (like the carnal apple become incorporate halo), all that remains of the body in the 1889 self-portrait, after all, is a disembodied head: the locus classicus of its higher, nobler functions, in sum, of the immaterial. Yet there is a case to be made that Gauguin's 'severed heads', of the same sort as the 1889 self-portrait, in fact do not transcend the body, but signify exactly as materiality, even as specifically allied to carnal knowledge. This is certainly the case in Gauguin's 1889 ceramic of a crouching nude, the so-called Black Venus,39 in which an overtly phallic lotus rises from just below the woman's sex, and again blossoms into the artist's severed head, thereby exactly reversing its traditionally anti-sensual symbolism. The ceramic is sexual-to be sure; natal, like the crowning of a newborn-perhaps; either way, however, the severed head and lotus symbolism here combine to produce an artwork far more of an exoticised piece with Courbet's Origin of the World (1866) than in any way its corporeal 'transcendence'. In another ceramic of that year, Gauguin's Self-Portrait Tobacco Pot as Grotesque Head (1889) (Fig. 4), the artist again conjoins his severed head, not with the lotus from the 1889 self-portrait, but with the thumb-sucking gesture of its pendant, Meyer de Haan, to create a head which, rather than severed from the body, now subsumes it. Indeed, the thumb-sucking gesture is doubly apt, given the same oral fixation to which its over-the-top purpose as a tobacco pot attests, as well as the erotic significance of thumb-sucking and smoking alike. If also putting words in his mouth, of the thumb-sucker Freud concludes, 'It's a pity I can't kiss myself. He explains, 'The child does not make use of an extraneous body for his sucking, but prefers a part of his own skin . . . because it makes him independent of the external world, which he is not yet able to control'.4 The grotesque head resonated no differently for Gauguin: 'my isolation and my concentration on myself create a kind of hunger, like an empty stomach', as the artist, in a letter to Emile Bernard, describes his impetus to create 'the Gauguin of the pot, the hand shrivelling in the furnace, the cry which longs to escape'.4 A self-portrait of rejection-in turn and in fact rejected by Madeleine Bernard, to whom Gauguin makes a torrid gift of the pot42-the solipsism it betrays is again at issue in Gauguin's 1889 bas-relief Be in love and you will be happy. Here, Gauguin juxtaposes the grotesque head, in the upper right quadrant of the relief, with the apparently very different image, at lower left, of 'Gauguin (like a monster)', as he writes to Bernard, 'taking the hand of a woman who resists'.43 Rather than folding desire in on himself, as is the case 37. Cf. Eric Zafran et al., Gauguin's 'Nirvana': Painters at Le Pouldu 1889-90 (Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Yale University Press: New Haven, 2001), p. 69, where Robert Welsh compares the apples in both portraits. Thus the difference between plucked and unplucked apples perhaps relates to the success of Meyer de Haan, but not Gauguin, in their respective bids for the attentions of their innkeeper, Marie Henry.

General Purchase Funds, 1946. with the bodily introversion of the pot, by setting up a resistant woman as external object, Gauguin merely seizes by force what, beyond himself, he still cannot otherwise have or control. However Gauguin's 'severed heads' might seem to ply the same Cartesian cogito of mind over matter whose terms Bataille famously reverses, in the last century, as the 'acephale',44 Gauguin at once subverts any such reading. For rather than embodying the disembodied 'Absolute Idea' or 'Absolute Spirit' in the manner, say, that Orpheus' severed but still cerebrating head paradigmatically does-Gauguin's singularly truncated self-portraits instead preserve the continuously sensual, if not outright erotic aspect conventionally associated with the body as a whole, and in Black Venus with genital sexuality in particular. By emphasising the grotesque head as an almost infantile site of pure, undifferentiated sentience,45 even of such paradigmatically pre-genital sexual activity as thumb-sucking in particular, Gauguin is exactly undoing these Symbolist tropes which habitually bifurcate the self, privilege the mind, and oppose grey matter to matter tout court. Gauguin's practice of making useful objects of these severed heads-as a grotesque head that doubles as a tobacco pot, or a self-portrait jug (Fig. 5)-only reinforces their brute materialism, even as it transgresses human figuration as an unexpected use value, one not unlike Bataille's theory of base materialism: 'with their feet in mud but their heads more or less in light, men obstinately imagine a tide that will permanently elevate them, never to return, into pure space. Human life entails, in fact, the rage of seeing oneself as a back and forth movement from refuse to the ideal, and from the ideal to refuse'.46 To look at the flowers the Self-Portrait Jug holds, as in Still Life with Japanese Print (1889), and, in this elevating way, see a Redon-like bouquet of 'ideas' is thus to beg the OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002 97</page><page sequence="10">Edward D. Powers question.47 For, rather than the bouquet itself, Gauguin is adamant about the real stuff whence flowers spring: not from a head held aloft in light, but from one which is itself like mud, the very stuff, indeed, of which the ceramic is made. 'God took a little clay in his hands', says Gauguin, 'and made every known thing. An artist, in turn (if he really wants to produce a work of divine creation), must not copy nature but take the natural elements and create a new element'.48 This 'new element' is the emphatically material self-presence which indeed motivates Gauguin's hallmark techniques of coiling and hollowing-out his often wilfully misshapen and, at times, formless pots, rather than throwing them on the wheel.49 No different is Gauguin's reason for including what would otherwise be so anomalous a presence as the grotesque head in his Sef-Portrait with Yellow Christ (1889-90) (Fig. 6). Here, Gauguin conjures the same artistic-as-messianic identity as in his Self-Portrait with Halo, except that he does so by means of the overdetermined formal trajectory he establishes: from self-portrait painting in the foreground; to painting his self-portrait sculpture-the grotesque head, which God the Father-like he signally places both behind himself and to his left; finally, to reprising his painting of the Tremalo Crucifixion sculpture- which, appropriately to his right, is not only the source of Yellow Christ (1889) (Fig. 7) but is also, as Francoise Cachin observes, itself a form of self- portraiture.50 Parallel to this regress through self-portrait painting and sculpture, Gauguin at once proceeds from the immediate reality of the foreground to the deeper reality of the self aptly excavated 'behind' it. Certainly, in the play of the grotesque head and Tremalo Crucifixion there is something of the bad cop/good cop chicanery in Self-Portrait with Halo, with the roles of the First and Second Adam now going to Gauguin's torrid gift to Madeleine Bernard on his left, as opposed to a traditionally celibate Christ on his right. Certainly, too, in all this scorched if you do, crucified if you don't imagery, there is something of the 'martyred' artist complex Gauguin peddled with such success. Indeed, whereas the fiery red-brown of the grotesque head conjures the agonistic struggle with matter that reds generally signify in his work,51 its medium exactly recalls Gauguin's comparison of his ceramics to the earthy stuff of which God likewise created the first and fallen Adam. Yet, if the venerably formalist analogy of the artist's God-like struggle with matter can find no better exemplar than Gauguin's 'divinely created' pot, surely it can find no better vehicle than his assimilation of a three-in-one self-portrait to a sort of Old versus New Testament allegory, with the artist, at centre, as messianic way station between man as unregenerate (the grotesque head), yet redeemed (the Tremalo Crucjfixion). It is just this radical failure of existence as existence for another-which, compact and clenched as fist, the spurned and thumb-sucking grotesque head betrays-that Gauguin finds, instead, in the splayed and sacrificial figure of Christ from the Tremalo Crucifixion. In turn Gauguin formally rhymes his regress of artistic media, as if of his messianic self, to emphasise their common trajectory: his three-quarter profile echoing the pot's; his elongated and moustachioed face diagonally embraced by Christ's own. Ultimately, Gauguin even conceives these distinctly formal and psychic registers to be the same: the difference of the self as that of the medium in which he variously expresses it. When, to Bernard, Gauguin thus expresses his pride in '[looking] for the character of each medium' and in having found, in the grotesque head, a 'strong expression of that character',52 I can only imagine that the same is true of the now-pendant Yellow Christ. Both are about embodiment, with the medium specifically embodying the message: fired clay like fried flesh-'scorched in the ovens of hell', as Gauguin describes 47. Cf.

Yet the eponymous yellow or green ground to which Gauguin returns the figure of Christ is not only the ground of painting but is also, itself, a natural process, analogously characterised by decay and reclamation. Thus, the jaundiced body of Christ is everywhere in evidence, not only as the yellow field in which he is crucified, but also as the ruddy trees engendered by the blood he spills, just as their own sappy lifeblood first falls with the coming of autumn. The profusion of Griinewaldian greens in Green Christ is no different. No longer a premonition of the Crucifixion-to which the green twilight of Gauguin's Agony in the Garden (Christ in the Garden of Olives) (1889) (Fig. 9) first attests-in Green Christ the figure's ultimate return to the ground has been naturalised as the moss which blankets it. Indeed, like the picturesque women at prayer in Yellow Christ, the trademark seaweed a labourer returns from gathering in Green Christ even localises the painting as part of the regional economy. If God is dead, as Gauguin insists he should be,55 even the burial is a profoundly secular one. A Kilo of Green-A Pound of Flesh. When I see people look at one of my works, and turn it this way and that, I am always afraid that they will finger it the way they would paw a girl's body and that my work will bear the traces of this ignoble deflowering forever after.56 - Paul Gauguin Basically painting is like man, mortal but forever alive in its struggle with matter.57 - Paul Gauguin Merely the reverse side of the mind-or-matter coin is the possibility that formal values can elevate themselves above, and even purge themselves of literary ones, as Clement Greenberg's theories of Formalism propose. On both scores, however, on the impossibility of mind or matter, literary or formal content, doubtless Bataille has the better of the argument, if only because there can be no 'Absolute' worse. 'Even the ideal', he says, 'carries within itself something of the deformities of which it is the exasperated antithesis'.58 No differently, the subject matter of Gauguin's early religious art-rather than 'transcending', or otherwise opposing its media-specifically doubles it: as the 'divine creation' not only of his ceramics, but also of his paintings, as he explains in a pair of letters to Schuffenecker. '[Do] not paint too much after nature. Art is an abstraction; derive this abstraction from nature while dreaming before it, and think more of the creation which will result than of nature. Creating like our Divine Master is the only way of rising toward God'.59 Later that year, discussing his 'abstract', even 'incomprehensible' Les Miserables self-portrait (1888), Gauguin again reproaches those 'disreputable' painters who remain 'shackled always to this world'.60 If 'thinking more of the creation which will result' than its 'shackles to this world'-let alone, the imperative to 'create like our Divine Master'-seems directly to anticipate Greenberg's own, it does: 'to imitate God', as he exhorts, by deprivileging mimesis and instead 'creating something valid solely on its own terms, in the way nature itself is valid, in the way a landscape-not its picture-is aesthetically valid; something given, increate, independent of meanings, similars, or originals. Content is to be dissolved so completely into form that the work of art or literature cannot be reduced in whole or in part to anything not itself.61 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002 99</page><page sequence="12">Edward D. Powers Gauguin, indeed, does Greenberg one better, equating a 'kilo of green' and a pound of flesh alike, 'as living matter; like the body of a living being',62 and analogising these to the Corpus Christi in turn. Thus is the very stuff of paint, like that of the body, and His Body in particular, as such, already its symbolic expression-or, in formalist terms, does form 'indissolubly' realise content. Indeed, of all the ways of 'creating like our Divine Master', or 'imitating God', perhaps there can be no better monkey wrench in the Modernist works than Gauguin's 'representational Jesus' ('Jesus figuratif'), the pictorial figure, which he indeed posits as the basis of Christianity itself.63 Rather than elevated above, or otherwise purged of literary content, Gauguin's god-as-image of god-both as paint and, in turn, as flesh-exactly realises it: not only in Michael Fried's formalist sense of the self-presence of painterly or sculptural matiere; but also in the sense the Gospel of St John espouses, where the first of all Christian signs and its material expression are indeed 'indissoluble'. 'And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, . . . full of grace and truth'.64 Fried's and John's are, moreover, the two directions in which Gauguin's 62.

Compare the passage from John with Michael Fried, 'Art and Objecthood', Artforum, vol. 5, no. 10, June 1967, p. 23. Herein is even the corollary problem of the body as such-of the hold the Other surely exercised on Gauguin as 'first and foremost the encounter with the body of the Other', as Solomon-Godeau explains in, 'Going Native', p. 124. Among the work that remains to be done is how the salient formal quality of Gauguin's figurations of the Other-their sculptural presence more as monument than as body-analogously intersects with literary figurations of alterity, especially sexual alterity and the 'Medusa's Head'. The potential for this venerably venereal trope-mirrored back, and in a sort of reaction-formation, instead, turning the model to stone-to explain both the mask- like countenance and sculptural disposition of many of Gauguin's greatest paintings is interesting, yet so far as I know, unexplored.

The first direction, forward and formalist, aims to elaborate how a 'kilo of green' can be 'greener than a half-kilo', as Gauguin says;65 for Yve-Alain Bois, none better than Matisse assimilates the formal lesson of Gauguin's 'kilo of green'-his use of pure, unmixed colour- instead as a question of painterly transposition and surface extension.66 The other direction-concerning the body of Christ, by contrast-is retrospective and literary, and looks so far backward, even, as the Patristic debates that would have made of His Body, perhaps the problem of Christian self-definition. No dead letter in nineteenth-century France, this debate is re-christened, not as the material, but-its flip side-the historical 'Life-of-Jesus' movement:67 whether His Body was historical or mythical, fully human or divine, neither or both, real or imaginary. Not only the most fundamental sign for Western Christendom-but also, in the elision of its material and representative aspects (i.e. its formal and literary content), perhaps the most subversive sign as well-is the body, that is in itself the sacrifice, of Christ. From the Patristic debates concerning the nature of that body to the 'presence' with which religious icons have been deemed invested-from the Incarnation and its trial during the Passion to the Eucharist and its 'real presence' during communion-all these signs of His Body, in both the artistic and the sacramental domains, are only the more emphatically material, that their physical substrate is not, and of course cannot, be deflected by verisimilitude-for Gauguin, 'literary' painting,68 which he rejects as a painterly stratagem in toto. This is the sense in which, as Georges Didi-Huberman proposes, these Christian 'signs . . . are at the same time presences'.69 For even without (impossibly) resembling the godhead, yet religious icons and the Eucharist nevertheless figure His Presence-and they do so, indeed, as a special case of the Freudian fetish.

Powers seen, and never can see-who is physically absent-we instead invest in the physical presence of the last thing we did (as, for example, in religious icons before prayer, or the Eucharist before communion): 'in the living present', then, 'the mystery has never ceased to exist'.70 These signs thus 'dissemble' physical absence, yet without (impossibly) resembling what is absent, instead, by virtue of the sign's own physical substrate. It is in the fervent 'presence' of these Christian signs, indeed, that we find the art lover who meets Bataille's celebrated challenge 'to love a canvas as much as a fetishist loves a shoe'.71 Yet, as Gauguin affirms in his later years, 'historically, Jesus is not to be found . . . The Jesus of Myth became a terrestrial Jesus'.72 On the one hand, this explains why all Gauguin's Breton figurations of Christ are either self- portraits or adaptations of popular Breton sculpture-or, in Vision after the Sermon, an angelic visitation recreated as a popular Breton entertainment. For Gauguin, these contemporary proxies provide exactly the historical-material reality which Christ by contrast lacks. On the other hand, Gauguin's belief in the mythical Christ, although not in the historical one, constitutes the sort of 'paradox' Didi-Huberman signals: how to make present what is absent, not by resembling it, but by virtue of the sign's own quiddity. In other words, although the figure of Christ purports to refer back to an historically certain referent, yet by default of any such referent, Gauguin's pictorial figure necessarily substitutes itself ('the Creator in the creature', as Didi-Huberman observes): not only its own temporal present ('eternity in time'), but also its own physical substrate ('the unfigurable in the figure').73 Thus does each material expression of the figure (Gauguin's 'kilo of green') provide both the embodied reality it otherwise lacks (the pound of flesh to which Gauguin compares it), and at once constitute its symbolic expression (the analogy of these to the Corpus Christi in turn). Even preceded by the myth, the figure of Christ is always, in this way, authentic and original. For, ontologically, he is always-already a pictorial figure: 'un Jesus figuratif-cree ainsi pour nous faire saisir le sens figure':74 a representational/figural means ('figuratif') created to its own symbolic/figurative end ('figure'). The corollary is that Gauguin's 'representational Jesus' is an act of faith inextricable in the fact of art making. The most compelling critiques of Gauguin's artistic-as-spiritual practice, in this materialist respect, are those of Reinhold Heller and Debora Silverman. Heller ingeniously proposes that Gauguin 'joined the color medium and the support into a previously nonexistent entity whose constructed flatness proclaims its own reality in opposition to a world filled with other objects. With its colors melting into the canvas itself, moreover, the physicality of the image disappears, enabling it to relate more to the non-corporeal realm of "Ideas" seen by Aurier and others as the true subject matter of painting'.75 Silverman similarly proposes, 'Gauguin's quest for sacrality immerses him in developing stylistic practices to dematerialize the physical surface of the canvas as much as possible, emulating the matte permeation of the fresco, for example, as he sought to efface the distance between a deficient material world and the ineffable world of dream and the divine'.76 Yet the shift from the anthropomorphic deities of classical myth to the disembodied 'Idea' of the Christian god-to which Hegel correlates the shift he discerns in aesthetics,77 and Heller and Silverman, if implicitly, also attribute the loss of physicality they discern in Gauguin's paintings78-is not the resolutely corporeal god Gauguin, in fact, figures: whether by assimilating Christ to self-portraiture, or by taking as subject matter the Passion, exactly when His Incarnation, his sheer physicality, is put to the test.79 Even without positing any loss of physicality, I would still agree with Silverman and others that Gauguin's material practice at 70.

The 'vanishing act' Idealism works on 'sensuous appearance' is, indeed, a fundamental basis of Karl Marx's 'Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic', in The Marx-Engels Reader, ed. Robert Tucker (W. W. Norton: New York, 2nd edn, 1978), pp. 106-25. 79. When Silverman thus alludes to the 'Passion of Christ as a model for modem art' (Silverman, Van Gogh and Gauguin, p. 45), I could not more completely agree, yet for opposite reasons. As Silverman sees it, the import of the Passion, for Gauguin, fundamentally resides in his identification, as a 'martyred' artist, with the humanity of Christ, realised as a topos of worldly suffering; and in a 'credo of descent into the self and ascent to transcendent purity', which he realises in turn by '[de-emphasising] the physical materiality of the canvas surface' (p. 45). Neither analogy, however, truly embraces the import of the Passion, as a specifically physical site-both of sacrifice, but also of redemption. For it is only as a part of the 'deficient material world' (p. 6) that Christ is said to redeem it: thus the Passion does not 'transcend' the flesh, but operates exactly within it; and it is 'in the flesh', as Doubting Thomas famously demonstrates, that Christ is indeed resurrected. Yet by having Gauguin 'de-materialise' or otherwise 'de- emphasise' that body as painting, Silverman exactly reverses the necessary physical humanity Gauguin, in fact, figures. 102 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002</page><page sequence="15">From Eternity To Here: Paul Gauguin and The Word Made Flesh 80. See, for example, Silverman, Van Gogh and Gauguin, pp. 234-7, 388-91. According to Silverman, Gauguin's matte techniques were 'considered by the [Impressionist] painters to be ways to maximize sensory immediacy, and to register more closely the vitality, delicacy, and reflection of colored light in nature' (p. 451 n. 67; cf. pp. 110-13). It would seem, then, that Gauguin redirects these revolutionary techniques of material opacity, not to transcend nature, but to create it, exactly as he describes the 'divine creation' of his ceramics, or exhorts painters to 'create like our Divine Master'. Gauguin thus proves that to "'rise toward God"' is not to '[replicate] divine creation above and beyond the contingencies and weight of matter' (p. 108), but rather in them. 81.

Indeed, Gauguin's emphasis on the materiality of pigment is entirely undiminished even if he did seek to transcend Christ's physical humanity as painterly lack; for even what transcends the body is not simply got rid of, but whether in opposition to the privileged term, or as its residuum, its difference remains. I would even like to suggest that Gauguin's early religious art participates in a larger, formal-as-literary paradigm, a notable secular variant of which is Charles Baudelaire's bourgeois black suit, whose master narrative, of course, is the hegemony of exchange value-and whose formal value (same cut, same colour, etc.), therefore, is already its symbolic value as well. Thus the black suit is not only an 'expression of universal equality', but also of its failure: the 'symbol of a perpetual mourning'.81 Seurat's 'point' is no different-and his master narrative, not at all; a 'great load of [joylessness]', as Ernst Bloch characterises the infinite reproduction of the dot, no less than what the dots themselves reproduce: painterly self-abnegation as form, 'landscapes of painted suicide' as content.82 No more than the Eucharist resembles Christ does a black suit or a dot resemble a bourgeois. Rather, they figure the bourgeoisie's ethical hegemony, in Didi-Huberman's sense, of realising as content, yet without resembling as form: whether its democratic urge has instead become the will to totalise-the sameness of the black suit or dot; or its 'ephemeral . . . fugitive . . . contingent' pleasures and fashions, 'whose other half', Baudelaire famously surmises, is exactly 'the eternal and the immutable'83-black suit or dot. Indeed, how, ever, to represent early Capitalism's 'pageant of fashionable life and the thousands of floating existences', in which Baudelaire says we are 'enveloped and steeped as though in an atmosphere of the marvellous',84as semblance? Yet, as 'dissemblance', the tidal blackness of Courbet's funeral party, in Burial at Ornans (1849-50), does quite nicely, as does the haze which 'envelops and steeps' that thickest of Pointillist pea soups, Seurat's Parade de cirque (1887-88), and not dissimilarly, of the political identities in which it also trades, instead, creates a formal scrim.85 Surely, the medium is the message, if not precisely in Greenberg's sense, then McLuhan's.86 Passionate Content. three days out of every six I am in bed, suffering horribly, without respite, and so have little inclination to work. I drift along and silently contemplate nature, completely absorbed in my art. There is no other way to salvation and it's also the best way of overcoming physical pain.87 - Paul Gauguin What a long calvary an artist's life is! And that's perhaps what makes us go on living. Passion gives life.88- Paul Gauguin Gauguin's Christ is exactly not the god of miracles, then, but the man of the Passion: 'Look at Gauguin's Christs', Bernard protests on just this score, 'they are human, they are of this world'.89 Gauguin indeed criticises the church's consecration of miracles for failing, as he says, to heed metaphorical 'qualification' ('correctif') which the bible itself indicates.90 Moreover, as the subject matter of his early religious art, he completely brackets them-most notably, the miraculous appearances when, following the Resurrection, Christ transcends the limits of the body-as Gauguin does the parables and everything else which does not directly pertain to His Body. Thus it is not the immortal, but exactly the mortal nature Gauguin consistently figures: not the 'Absolute OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002 103</page><page sequence="16">Edward D. Powers Idea' or 'Absolute Spirit' of Christ, but the 'natural, corporeal, sensuous, objective being' who, as Marx says, 'is a suffering [being]'.91 For the Passion is precisely when 'the Word made flesh' is singularly in the ascendant: when rather than being greater, Christ is-and, as such, suffers. Of all the times Christ sheds blood in the Bible,92 all but the Circumcision are during the Passion, and are taken as subject matter by Gauguin in 1889. Thus, the Agony in the Garden, when 'his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground',93 Gauguin transforms into his title self-portrait. The Crowing with Thorns and Flagellation he transforms into another self- portrait, albeit of the singularly truncated variety-his Self-Portraitjug. Lastly, the Crucifixion and Piercing of His Side-when 'forthwith came there out blood and water94 Gauguin similarly reinvents within the Breton mise-en-scene of Yellow Christ. Green Christ, in turn, completes the cycle of embodied suffering to which the Three Marys first testify in Yellow Christ. With its Griinewaldian greens and its source in 'cold stone/from the ground'95as Gauguin describes the sandstone Nizon Calvary-Green Christ thus brings to term the jaundiced, if still organic physicality of the wooden Tremalo Crucifixion, all the while reiterating the putrefying colours and cold forms of death itself. Yet with no hint of Resurrection in sight-having clipped not only the wings of the Nizon Calvary, but also the angels themselves96 Gauguin's dead Christ is, indeed, dead. But Gauguin's emphasis on the Passion also bespeaks a fundamental truth of his religious orientation. By insisting on these moments of Christ's physical suffering as the most direct revelation of his humanity, Gauguin is far closer to the populist theology of Vincent Van Gogh than to the Roman Catholic mysticism, most notably, of his fellow Nabi, Maurice Denis.97 Whereas Van Gogh looks for religion in the everyday, Gauguin looks for the everyday in religion, when it fundamentally reveals its mortal countenance.98 In the famous anecdote in which Van Gogh nurses a coalminer back from death's door, whereas Van Gogh compares the coalminer to Christ Crowned with Thorns, Gauguin instead likens the coalminer to Lazarus-and Van Gogh, in turn, to Christ, even having his Arles flat-mate inscribe himself, in addition, as the third person of the Trinity on their wall. Whether as a coalminer Crowned with Thorns who faces his own Harrowing of Hell ('going back down into the mine, and resuming his work'), or a nursemaid who Lazarus-like 'brings a dead man, a Christian, back to life':99 either way, we confront a profoundly natural understanding of Christ, one which is signally incarnate in physical experience. Gauguin's oft-remarked choice of vermilion for Christ's hair and beard in Agony in the Garden is, in this respect, doubly telling. For Gauguin, reds seem variously to signify as the domain of physical conflict (for example, the wrestlers' field in Vision after the Sermon): whether as scars of physical assault (Self-Portrait Jug), or as figurations of unregenerate materiality (the upper quadrant and an apple in Self-Portrait with Halo; the corresponding hair, moustache, blouse, and dish of apples in its pendant, Meyer de Haan).'00 No less conventionally, yellow thus signifies oppositely: in both Vision and Self-Portrait with Halo as the angel's wings; and in the self-portrait as well as its pendant, as Gauguin's halo and Meyer de Haan's light (of the world)-the redemptive promise of the lotus, like the expectation of messianic redemption held out by the Milton volume-respectively. Indeed, as Gauguin concludes a version of the coalminer anecdote, in the Yellow House they shared at Aries 'Vincent . . . trace[d] with his yellow brush . . . "I am the Holy Spirit/I am Sound of Mind"'. 10 But if Gauguin's unusual choice of vermilion for Christ's hair and 91. Marx, Marx-Engels Reader, p. 115 (original emphasis suppressed). 92.

By everywhere eliding animate and inanimate, real and imaginary, past and present, Gauguin's Yellow Christ ingeniously translates the mystery of His Divinity, instead, as a question of phenomenological ambiguity. Cf. Brettell, The Art of Paul Gauguin, p. 157. In Denis' Offering at a Wayside Cross (1890) and Sacred Heart Crucified (1894), by contrast, the crucified Christ is set squarely on a stepped plinth, insisting on its unambiguous status as art object and, therefore, its absolute distance from humanity. In turn, Denis 'glues on' the difference of Christ's divinity as parting clouds- become-choirs of angels in Offering, the same genre of pyrotechnics on which he relies in Sacred Heart. Denis' emphasis, not on a Christ who is fundamentally like we are, but on the resurrected Christ, betrays no less an anti- phenomenal predisposition: whether manifest as the failure of sight in Easter Morning (1893), with Mary Magdalen at first mistaking Christ for a gardener, or the refusal of touch in Noli Me Tangere (1895). 98.

For both Gauguin and Meyer de Haan, Christian and Jew, the artist instead substitutes-for the terribilita the anti-semitic grotesque of the red headed Jew usually connotes 03-a more unusual sense of physical pathos. Thus are Gauguin's 'thin, stick-like arms',104 as Jules Huret describes them in Agony in the Garden, strikingly similar to the famously gnarled hand that the 'slight, rickety, deformed, sickly, almost infirm creature', Meyer de Haan,105 all but swallows in the 1889 portrait. Rather than culminate in the transcendence of physical existence, both Agony in the Garden and Meyer de Haan are positively mired in it: they flatly exemplify the 'crushing of an ideal',106 as Gauguin describes the former, exactly 'this poor, miserable, hampered, despicable Actual' no less at issue in the latter. Yet the corporeal emphasis these two works share is nowhere more clearly avowed than by the fact that they are both, of course, portraits. But if reds and greens variously materialise human suffering, what of the 'pain that is both divine and human' 107 as Gauguin describes his Agony? Even without rehearsing the wonderfully Jesuit distinctions that Christian doctrine has made of Christ's 'only in appearance', 'only in part' and/or 'only at will' humanity, yet it is none of these-which, however variously, still emphasise Christ's divinity-that Gauguin professes and, indeed, professes himself a heretic. The church is 'like a dirty stick', he says, 'you really don't know by which end to pick it up. Better to wear gloves'.108 Rather, Gauguin was by parts anti-Trinitarian: that God-the-Father alone is increate, whereas Christ is both begotten yet unequal to the Father. By others, he was Adoptionist: that Christ was born fully and exclusively human. 'Christ should not be considered as a supernatural being, but as he himself appeared', Gauguin insists throughout 'The Modern Spirit and Catholicism', 'and what we call his miracles should be understood only in their ethical and not material sense'.109 Throughout both this essay and an earlier version of it, 'The Catholic Church and Modern Times', Gauguin thus confesses that, like any of his followers, Christ was born human, and only 'born again' divine-as a 'second birth', one at an 'acquired stage': literally born, and only metaphorically 'born again'. 1 Next following his anti-Trinitarian/Adoptionist heresy-the literal (corporeal) birth, he differentiates from metaphorical (spiritual) rebirth-another major apostasy is Gauguin's disbelief in transubstantiation for just this failure to keep its symbolism, which is various and mutable, separate from the sign's own physical substrate, which is not. Rather than 'transubstantial', the Paschal bread and wine, Gauguin contends, are both 'created' (by baker and vintner, of course), and therefore 'unequal' (to the body and blood of Christ). Because the substance of the bread and wine never changes, to speak of them as the body and blood of Christ-as orthodox Roman Catholicism teaches-is no longer to speak of them literally, but again metaphorically.111 Whether differentiating Christ's divine rebirth or presence in the Eucharist as 'metaphorical', or his miracles as 'qualified', these are the same terms, as Amishai-Maisels observes,112 according to which Gauguin also conceptualises pigment-its literal versus metaphorical properties. Following his discussion of how a 'kilo of green' can be 'greener than a half-kilo', in an exceptionally prolix passage even for Gauguin, he suggests not only the analogy of pigment to flesh, as painting, but also the 'comparison' of painting to biblical parable in turn.113 Either way, he discerns the expression of a 'symbolic form', whose variously materialising-literal-superficial- figuratif sense he specifically opposes OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002 105</page><page sequence="18">Edward D. Powers to its jfigure' sense, exactly as he does his 'representational Jesus' ('Jesus figuratif) to the symbolic end for which he too is created ('cree ainsi pour nous faire saisir le sensfigure'). Because all Gauguin's 'figuratif' terms insist on what is most literal about this 'symbolic form'-just as 'figure' condenses what is most metaphorical about it-if we simply substitute 'the materiality of the sign' and 'the sign', respectively, and line the terms up accordingly, we arrive at what we might call Gauguin's ultimate 'equation': that pigment is to (His) flesh and the materiality of the sign, as painting is to (biblical) parable and the sign itself. All the while discussing Christ, Gauguin is grappling with how to create a painterly sign whose material and symbolic expression, homologous to the body of Christ, are immanent. Thus does Gauguin not only materialise 'the Word made flesh' as pigment, but also theorise it as painting. 106 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 25.2 2002</page></plain_text>
