<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greek Greek Philosophers as Theologians: The Divine Arche. By Adam Drozdek. Pp. χ+ 275. Aldershot, UK and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2007. isbn 978 ο 7546 6189 4· £5°■ In detailed discussion with philosophical theologians from at least the eighteenth century ce up to the present day, Drozdek surveys and argues with and assesses those Greek language philosophers from the Milesians to the early Stoics who have spoken overtly of deity, or might be thought to have done, if only on the basis of fragments surviving (some, of course, only in much later Greek and Latin sources). Though the thought is carefully presented, the unargued but explicit criterion deployed is success or failure in anticipating later Christian monotheism as expounded by such as Augustine and Aquinas (pp. 146, 170, 245). So Xenophanes is welcomed for his critique of the immorality and general anthropomorphism of the Homeric Gods, and for his positing instead of an abstract 'perfection', a stance dubbed religious but with religion purged of this-worldly mythology.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 661 Heraclitus is commended for propounding an immutable underlying divine harmony, an abstract controlling unity 'beneath' the conflicting phenomena that humans experience, an underlying unity arguably identified with the Logos, to which traditional myths and rituals, almost despite themselves, do point. The suggestion that the ascription of intelligence to the divine fire—Logos is itself also anthropomorphic is mentioned but dismissed. Parmenides is enlisted in this progress, for hypostasizing perfect 'Being', that of which we have only more or less distorted reflections in phenomena, and thus 'the process of abstracting the essence of divinity is brought to a higher level' (p. 50). Then '[t]he emphasis put on harmonia is a lasting contribution of Pythagoreanism. Later, the proof of the existence of God from design is going to become one of the strongest proofs... Also, the Pythagorean concept of God who surpasses the infinite is later expressed by Augustine and most prominently by the founder of set theory, Georg Cantor' (p. 70). A further touch is attributed to Empedocles, the idea of a divine mind enjoying its solitary harmony. In the next proposed advance, Anaxagoras' 'Mind' is 'closer to the monotheism of Christianity and Judaism [stc; no Islam] than to the polytheism of traditional Greek religion... a new quality in comparison to the views of his predecessors, but it can also be considered a continuation of these views' (p. 93). However, false moves are also discerned: for instance, Democritus' atheistic atomic system cannot stand without the divine intelligence it presupposes. And so we are taken on through Protagoras, Prodicus, Socrates, Antisthenes, Plato, Aristotle, the old Academy, the Cynics (dismissed without much argument as anti-intellectual), Epicurus (but not Euhemeros), and the early Stoics. Where modern copies were to hand of the ancient texts referred to, the citations could not be faulted, and an overview of the ancient sources may be welcomed, even by those who do not share Drozdek's metaphysical predilections. The exposition is usually clear, though not always elegant ('The problem of atheism was real enough that Plato distinguished several kinds', p. 119). Yet particularly disappointing is the failure even to sketch the social context and implications of the views advanced in times past, or the individual psychology involved, let alone the kinds of personal askesis that would have been implicated: there is little</page><page sequence="3">662 REVIEWS help in grounding what is discerned, little if any attempt to 'cash' it in other terms. doi: 1 doi: 10.1093/jts/flp041 F.
