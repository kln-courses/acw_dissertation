<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSIC IN BENGAL BY ARTHUR HUTCHINGS I WAS sent with other R.A.F. men to the S.E. Asia theatre of activity at a fortunate-unfortunate period: unfortunate because the invading tide had reached its high-water mark, the Imphal area, and fortunate because this made Bengal at that time a forward area as far as air bases were concerned. Let the hero at once admit that he saw more of the war in London air-raids than ever in S.E. Asia. Those who care for the Bengali less than for other types of Indian may wonder why I consider a posting to that province more fortunate than one to the south, middle or north-west of the peninsula. This peripatetic essay may show the main reason, that the music of Bengal seemed to present to my western ears very few of the difficulties that approach musical visitors to other parts; secondly it is of interest to a subscriber to a quarterly that takes letters as well as music in its scope, to be among people who have the most beautiful language of India and by far the finest, the only considerable modern literature. The Bengali is not liked sometimes even by other Indians, and one of the chief reasons for this seems to be the fact that the Bengali is so much in love with his own province and its cultural heritage that he fails to see outside it: his chief political interests seem to be the corrupt, comic-opera skirmishes of the Bengal Assembly, scandal at this or that wickedness, nepotism, bribery, black marketing, on the part of Big Business, the Civil Service or the Police-the latter being regarded as one huge joke, since they include numbers of non-Bengalis. I am afraid they are on the whole a very bad joke. Another attraction for the Englishman in Bengal is the universal grasp of English as a second language. This, too, does not always commend the Bengali to other Indians, who say, with truth, that the chief motive is economic, and that is why Bengalis grab so many justiciary and governmental posts outside their province. English is the medium of instruction in all schools after the age of twelve, and Bengal's respect for education is often seen as a manifestation of that inferiority complex which I have found the greatest fault of these people, making them inclined to parade knowledge or to adopt a conceited arrogance towards illiterates and foreigners-a word universally and pointedly used, even to a personal friend, until that friend makes sharp rebuke. The answer given to the request to learn Hindi is that, if a language reaching beyond Bengal's frontiers is needed, English goes a great deal farther and has a " respect- able" literature, while who in Bengal would forsake the language of Tagore And the Chatterjis? Hindi, therefore, is rarely understood and never taught in the schools. I was soon sent to a jungly piece of land set between cultivated fields surrounding a ring of thatched villages. The airmen sang their usual song, originally applied to Shaibah, about the Air Force finding the most isolated spot on a map, and saying " We'll have our station there ". Our huts were carefully hidden in a mango grove which would have inspired Marvell to green thoughts, though we were inspired only by the green shade. A view from my hut on the edge of the wood, across fields of paddy, jute, flax and vegetables was very like the flat countryside of Cambridge. The landscape is sodden for a great part of the year, and but for an occasional coconut or wild date palm, its trunk incised and an earthenware pot tied below the incision to collect molasses, 26</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC IN BENGAL one could imagine oneself in the fen district at home rather than anywhere in the far east. A fine little green and gold bird, the bee-eater, is invariably perched on the sugar pots to collect toll. The main road, many miles away, also tickled the memory, for stretches of it ran through avenues of overhanging trees as through a tunnel; one of the finest of such roads is that from Jessore to Calcutta, its trees planted by Thackeray's father so that the roots should consolidate the raised track. Our nearest town was the small but ancient one of Krishnagar, on the other side of the river Ganguley, one of the many vagaries of the Gangetic outfall. To get out of our airfield we had to take a garry the thirteen miles of dreadful road to Krishnagar ferry. In monsoon it was impassable. The fun began, however, in trying to get across the ferry to the Krishnagar side. Either the river was in spate, at which time the ferryman did wonderful piloting to judge nicely the landing of our truck on its pontoon, or else, in the ferryman's words, " the water was few "; but, raging torrent or clear, sand-banked stream, to get the truck on or off the pontoon was like enticing a pig into a slaughterhouse. It frequently stuck in descending the bank, or ascending on Krishnagar side, and had to wait till a day when the water rose or fell to a manageable level. My decision sometimes to swim across, holding shorts aloft in one hand, shocked the local ceremonial bathers, who are strangely sensitive about the decencies. One of the "stuck" occasions brought my first Bengali music. Ramswami the ferryman was a perennial songster whom we used to watch delivering his minstrelsy at the village maidens who were crossing in fishermen's boats to and from Krishnagar market. That they were naughty songs one could tell from the way the ladies nudged, ogled, tittered and pretended to turn away, hitching their sarees over their heads. One of these songs, which proceeded by arithmetical progression like " One man went to mow ", I found to be nothing more salacious than a list of ferry passengers who were clumsy in a boat, beginning with " O somebody Kumar Dey " and totalling Mrs. Dey and all the little Deys. At that time I had picked up little Bengali, and the only words I noted under the tune are shown here: Ex.i Af ij ii Lb a J IjJ. 1 III 0 tanta - rara dey, Ta- ra - ra dey etc. Ait u Ju j n=ljjj i j j I j 1j 1 iI The next song I heard, without the singer's knowing it, came from a gnarled old man wearing the straw conical hat of the Bengali peasant. He was thatching my roof where it leaked, taking grass off one roof and putting it on another to avoid fetching fresh. He worked at a very leisurely pace, for he was paid by the day, and with Bengali commercial astuteness intended in actual fact to make thatch while the invading sun shone. Though in the Dorian mode, his song did not sound any more Indian than the boatman's. It was more like a French chanson or one of our carols: Ex.2 Ch oJ J IJ - J I JJ W J J bJ I Choto ko-thai? Kana-dio - nai. Raya bari kampe-te 27</page><page sequence="3">MUISIC AND LETTERS In order to find more songs we had to get into the villages where some inhabitants may not have seen Englishmen before. We followed the paths across paddy allotments and came to a road sunken and banked like a Devon lane. But as we approached the village the pariah dogs announced us in a furious yapping; farmers' dogs took up the chorus and, as our military boots tramped past the first huts, women fled and patriarchs in loin cloths blocked entrances with awful stare. Neither dogs nor men approved of uniforms. I learnt that, in the past, sepoys, followers and, unfortunately, some of our own men, had given uniforms a bad name by sallies at girls, by bad language, of which the Bengali has an inexplicable horror, and by demands of food with threats. We were as determined to reverse this reputation as to hear more music-; we bought dhotis and punjabis (white surplices) to the disgust of those who spend evening after evening in a mess, pining for home and telling us that " every time we mixed with one of these people we let down British prestige ". We pointed out that, in our opinion, the seven R.A.F. officers who had passed false cheques on a Calcutta bank that month beat us at that game, and that, on a three- or four-year tour, we should find the maintaining of a stiff upper lip a little tedious without some other occupation. So we shuffled off barefoot to Belpukur village in native dress: the dogs did not bark; the ladies fled not. We saluted the first stranger with the praying-hands greeting of Bengal and said " Namaskar Babu ! ". But Babu only laughed, for he was superintendent of building construction on the camp, and dragged us in front of the villagers as show pieces. The dress was taken as a high compliment and we were made much of. Unfortunately Babu did not lodge in one of the humbler cottages, and when we asked for music, little Sachi had to give us a song she had learnt from a Krishnagar singing-master. It was a high, sophisticated wail, accompanied at the unison by a little two-octave floor-harmonium. But we were more lucky than we had hoped to be. What time had we to get back ? No particular time. Then why not come to the market square (a euphemism!) for a special Kali puja held in supplication for the cholera epidemic ? " We do not worship idols really "-you hear this all over Bengal-just as caste has almost died out, but " these old tings are ni-ce ! " There would be jatra plays from eleven o'clock until two in the morning. Jatra means journey; the name may come from the fact that the plays show the journeys of gods and heroes of the Hindu Odyssey, or, more probably, from the fact that the players usually wander from village to village for small payment,_ food and lodging. Nothing I have seen could have formed a more close parallel to medieval pageants and mystery plays, or to the normal " mofussil" conditions of play production in Shakespeare's youth. At Belpukur they had erected a bamboo hustings with thatched roof, the whole lit by oil lamps. All sat on the ground except ourselves, who were offered benches, chairs being almost unknown in Bengal villages where meals are taken on the clean floor of a veranda from plates of fresh-cut banana leaf. Each diner uses several for meals which I shall describe later. It has been observed that the songs quoted so far have a Gallic flavour. In some respects the people of Bengal resemble the French, having a similar meanness followed by impulsive generosity, the same tenacity to land and the investing of savings in the acquisition of land-for a peasant will have strips -miles apart while nothing can induce him to make convenient and profitable exchange-a language which similarly comes " trippingly off the tongue " and at high speed, the same fastidi- 28</page><page sequence="4">MUSIC IN BENGAL ousness and contrary tendency to " fine writing " in their best literature, and the same ability to exploit the pockets of foreigners. It must be remembered that Bengal is a land of recurrent tragedy; plague, pestilence, famine and flood are the hardest acts of God, but nature is more often manifest as Kali the Destroyer, patron goddess of Calcutta, than as Mother Durga, the terrible and bountiful, who is Kali's other facet. Pujas in honour of the two are the biggest festivals of the year in these parts, and come as thanksgiving and supplication at the end of each monsoon. I seem to be saying a great deal in excuse for the national failings of Bengal, but I am trying to be impartial. Certain jibes one is sick of hearing, including the one about blotting-paper mentality in the highly educated Bengali, as if this mentality were at all rare in Europe. But in general the Bengalis are sly, complex and timid, fighting with other weapons than physical courage. They are, on the whole, not liked by the military, though they are clever enough to get into the more skilled R.A.F. trades, markedly more so than other Indians, and as for their lacking courage when occasion fires them, Wing Commander Mukherji, acknowledged one of the best C.O.'s some of us ever knew, and the late Wing Commander Majumdar, to mention only two of our distinguished officers, prove the reverse. On the other hand, Bengal detests war, felt insulted that she was brought into war without previous consultation, and needs famine conditions to make her sons recruit for the armed forces. After one has been in the hot, dry and dusty parts of India, it is with relief that one comes back to the verdant spread of Bengal. She is green all the year round, well watered in winter and summer, and though one can conceive no climate more humid, disease-bringing and sticky than the months of monsoon from June to October, the winter is like English summer, as soft and green, without the uncertainty of rainfall from day to day. The month's single shower is well advertised in the firmament on the previous day. And even the hot-house atmosphere of monsoon, during which we get covered with prickly-heat pustules for which there is no cure but the return of tolerable weather, seem worth while to those temperaments which revel in the luxuriance of Bengal vegetation. The jungle trees themselves blossom with overwhelming beauty, and flowers, liked more for scent than sight in posies and garlands, follow in lovely procession throughout the year. So also does Bengali culture and civilization differ from that of other provinces. To the Gallic traits just mentioned may be added two others. One is gaiety. After the dour, Arabic types of faces found on Muslims of the hot plains, whose children seem old and solemn pre- maturely, one is struck by the cheek of the Bengali urchin with his " You give me one efforeign esstamp ? ", or the sentences delivered at me in one spate: " Are you English, Scots or Welsh b-d ? [The word is not' bard ' ]. I know Sergeant Paterson, and he gave me one photo ". I gathered that Sgt. P., though not a Cumbrian, was an authority on the teaching of the English language. Gaiety reaches its peak at pujas, weddings and other excuses for a party, a jatra, a day off work and sweet consumption. I have seen Hindus and Muslims attending each other's festivals and weddings in the villages and living happily together, though one finds all-Muslim villages and all-Hindu or Christian villages, since conversion usually affects a whole village through the influence of a headman. Individual converts would find themselves socially isolated with regard to such matters as marriage, even in those Hindu villages which regard idols only as we do Father Christmas, and whose religion is like the vague Theism of the towns. The communal problem 29</page><page sequence="5">MUSIC AND LETTERS 30 hardly arises till a professional political agent or some wretched little Calcutta coxcomb of a student begins the dissension. Along with this gaiety is the other Gallic trait of fastidiousness in cookery. I know no food more delectable than that of Bengali house- wives. The story of " a bowl of rice a day " does not apply. Poverty is the rule rather than the exception, as in South Ireland when I was last there, and one finds the same love of gossiping and wasting time gracefully. Little is eaten, but that little, taken twice a day, though fruit and tea may be taken on rising, must have certain flavours. Unless those flavours are present the eaters are miserable, and unfortunately the spices and herbs are more expensive than the rice or chippatties. I shall find English cookery flavourless when I return if it is at all like English cookery here; but I remember that, new or old, a potato in England tastes like a potato, whereas tinned potatoes from the Channel Islands or wherever they come from are insipid. Rice is on the big banana-leaf square and you make of it little round walls as a child does to his sand castle. On smaller leaf-plates around this are ranged fish in turmeric, fish in mustard oil, than which there is no better fish, a mango or brinjal preparation, or fried, spiced pods of a plant called potal, or bamboo shoots in gravy, or curried .eggs, or kedjeree or chutney. On festivals there are home-made sweets of many varieties, and stuff like fudge. Savoury pasties are called sweets. The capacity for sweets among these people astounds the Englishman, who, however, likes the drinks-always orange water, or rose water, or ginger water, rather than plain water when visitors arrive. But l?engal water taken pure is admittedly flat and poor to the taste. One almost enjoys the enforced chlorination. Sweets bring me back to my mutton-the Belpukur jatra, where trays of sweets, which it seemed ungracious to eat in such limited quantity, were offered at each change of scene. The acting had the swagger and magniloquence that we are told was characteristic of Marlowe, Burbage and Shakespeare. There were no small gestures, and not a movement of the foot that was not deliberate if not stilted. The dresses of the gods and heroes were such as children get out of the rag-cupboard at Christmas, and nobody seemed a bit the less impressed. The music was not good, though I noted one or two songs of semi-classical sound and one like a carol that the audience seemed to know. The chief music came from Bengal's monster and legion frogs and crickets, for the human voices were poor and thin. More fascinating was the delicate art of drumming, not exclusive to Bengal. It takes years to perfect, and in tuning Berlioz can have had an ear no more sensitive than that of an Indian village drummer. The skins are stretched over the mouths of chattis, or water pots, of various sizes, and laced with skill and neatness. These tablas, or small drums, are tuned at the fourth, the fifth and the octave until those intervals are perfect indeed, the process taking a long time and being repeated between performances. True, I was to know far more expert drumming when I came to hear classical music, but the subtle rhythms and the delicacy of touch in these village drummers was without memory for me. The tabla is not struck by stick, fist or hand; the ball of the hand rests against the side and the fingers tap singly, as in piano playing, by extending over the parchment with a finesse that knows exactly the spots to choose at a half-second. Each tap is as much a clear note as that of a stringed instrument. At dances I have known no music but that of tabla, though I rarely see any but solo dances. At one puja there was a dance in rings, and the dancers sang</page><page sequence="6">MUSIC IN BENGAL a tune not worth recording. A colleague tells me of a dance he saw in the Faridpur district which must be a legacy of more primitive times. Perhaps it comes from up-country, for the dancers use sticks, as in our morris, with the addition that lunges are made as if in mock fight. I have never heard the big wooden drum with two skins called dhol except at pujas and weddings. I think it is specifically religious. The dawn and dusk worship at a shrine is rarely attended by any but the brahmin pirohit ringing a handbell while he arranges the flowers, sets out or collects the food, oils and other offerings, and burns incense or sandal wood, waving the flames and smoke from a little incense pot looking like an eastern lamp. Sometimes others will be present to sound the conch or bang a gong. The anthropomorphic deities are roused in the morning and bedded at night. This is the narrower meaning of puja, or worship. But a big puja includes festival of so many days, promenading, eating and the jatras. The deities must be entertained with music-and what music ! The only note is the repeated blowing of a conch shell, or of two or three dissonant conches. The drums beat as never in England since the Eatanswill Election. Rattle, thump go sticks on larger dhols, bang go fists at both ends of an oval shaped drum, clang go all sizes of cymbals, gongs, bells, tongs and bones, the whole at an incredibly frantic dissonance and fortissimo. The only impression of Asiatic music that I share with B. Nichols, Esq. is my amazement that this tringlebang has no ragged ending, coming suddenly to its stop at dead heat. This nightmare music gave us an experience that is amusing only in the memory. Some of the workers on aerodrome construction kept Kali puja; this is held a fortnight after Durga puja, though not con- tinued for the seven or eight days of its predecessor, which is like Christmas; all men are brothers and visit with gifts of cloth and sweets; magazines and papers print special puja numbers, thick and illustrated like our Christmas annuals. At Kali puja, the actual worship is as badly attended as are early services at home, for the rites of Kali are dark and dangerous and may not begin till midnight. Words and ceremonial need the utmost care, and if there -is a slip, action or mantra must be repeated correctly. During the evening houses were lined with rows of candles on roof, wall and verandah, for Kali puja is the devali festival of India outside Bengal. Sweets were eaten, the children given parties, and all went to bed. So did we. The Public Works Department coolies and overseers had erected the usual booth, arched with banana trees, banked with flowers, fruits and cooked things, and roped off in front. Kali, shining black and sinister, stared from her three eyes with dripping tongue, bestriding her dead with upraised knife. Suddenly at midnight the whole din broke upon our sleep and the intolerant yelled angrily. In six minutes the " music " came to a customary full stop; the ceremonial drummers, once the shoemaker cast, left the shrine, sat down twenty yards away, took out cards and smoked. We returned to bed. In a quarter of an hour the pandemonium was repeated and we left our beds, suspecting more to follow. We were not mistaken. The bespectacled and saffron-shawled priest had his missals in a trough before his mat, and though the proper book was in Sanskrit, he fingered a Bengali translation for rubric cere- monial directions. Foods were prepared for Kali and destroyed by fire. The acolyte made the fire wrongly, or to the wrong mantra, and had to do it again according to book. A kid was slain-Kali being the only puja requiring blood sacrifice. At intervals the purohit turned and gesticulated to the drummers to get up and repeat their concerto. When he had finished he washed his hands, on sight of which the men left 31</page><page sequence="7">MUSIC AND LETTERS cards and cigarettes and approached like communicants to have the Kali- spot of red powder printed on the forehead like the ashes on Ash Wednes- day. Sweets from the shrine were handed round and puja was done. I have said that the Belpukur Kali-jatra was not great musically; but in March the P.W.D. employees, having made a bigger pile than ever before in their lives, invited us to a fine puja in honour of Saraswati, goddess of the arts and learning. She has specially good play cycles, lasting for several days, together with modern music and dancing. The school children assemble with flowers and songs for her, and have their own dancing and singing competitions. Her figure is beautiful, astride a swan, holding a cittar and decked with flowers. Her shrine is like a pretty rockery or grotto-garden, and nearly always has a fountain or artificial pond. The acting was superb, for this was a Calcutta troupe. So was the dancing and playing. I was told that these voices, magnificent even to a foreigner, mouthed the Bengali of Santipur, considered the purest and most orotund dialect. Santipur itself I know well, and think it the most beautiful of towns in this area. It is famous for the dhoties and sarees woven in its houses, for it is hidden in trees and innocent of factory chimneys. As each actor took the stage-an art some of our western actors have forgotten-he did obeisance and dedication to Saraswati whose shrine was at the other end of the huge marquee, borrowed from Calcutta. The plays were of the Rama-Rhada legend but, as in Shakes- peare's time, farced with modern interludes like a harlequinade or comic vaudeville. The first of these showed the warm reception and beating of a drunken husband by a termagant wife. In came the son of the house -none other than Ramaswami the ferryman, who made uproarious backchat with members of the audience, including the ladies, and sang his rude songs with the good tunes. I should mention that I have never seen drunkenness in Bengal, where there seems to be a horror of western alchoholic indulgence. A Bad Thing. They say there is a very potent drink among villagers, made from date molasses. The next jatra I was to see, during Durga puja, brought me a new kind of music, for I had been unable to hear the children singing to Saraswati during a full day at the aerodrome. Durga jatra was held in front of a large house. Many of the big landlords retain the practice of their fathers by holding jatra for all and sundry in their courtyards, as did Elizabethan innkeepers. Sometimes a permanent stage is built. My new experience was the sound of hymns, though whether old or modern I was unable to tell. It is hard to get an answer to the question " How old? " in Bengal. So far as the tunes went I was left unmoved. None was in any mode I did not know, but in plain major and minor. In following Indian music with our mental fixation of tonality, however, one finds nothing odd till the tune ends on a mid- scale note that we should not consider cadential, though the piece has not, to our ears, established any other than the usual tonic. In key C, the stop may be on F or A, though the mode is neither Lydian nor Aeolian. I notice this even in Tagore's songs, some of which I have on records. Perhaps in these the addition of western triads only confuses mode, but I should not like to criticize until I understand. I can, however, record the effect upon my ears. The Durga hymn, as also some modern hymns written for the church of the Brahmo Samaj, a Calcutta sect which fuses Hindu and Christian thought, and some hymns for the same sectcomposed by Tagore, have thestuff of incantation about them, but with neither the disembodied purity nor the fluidity of Christian plainchant. The lack of freedom in the Durga hymns may have been a popular perversion into measured, notes, like the damnable stuff, mercifully 32</page><page sequence="8">MUSIC IN BENGAL becoming rare in London, which flattens plainsong to the square rhythm of a metrical Anglican chant and adds a full modern organ accompani- ment. One hears much of it on the Continent, and the poor, nasalized singing of this Durga puja in a land of solo artists who have not yet shown any love of the magnificence of choral singing, together with the swooping up or down intervals in whining portamento, reminded one of singing in some continental churches, especially as the religious words had a strangely Latin sound: Vande mataram! (We praise the Mother) Sujalam, sufalam, vande mataram ! This, and more which I did not understand, seemed a close counterpart to Salve Regina or Ave Maria. Once, during duty at a station in east Bengal, I set off under a full moon in the direction from which I had frequently heard the wail of women's voices and the tapping of tabla. These may have been either secular or devotional songs, if to them any song is secular-a matter to be discussed later. It is difficult to tell the difference, for they say that the coolie women, taken to and from the aerodrome for sand- gathering and bricklaying, and unused to the ride in a lorry, sing religious songs for their safety, though they sound just like folksongs. The village was separated from me by some jungle and a mango plantation, and as I approached, the tune, repeated for at least twenty verses with the persistence of a litany, could easily be learnt: Ex.3 j IJ4 I^ JJ i IJ J ItCj4j f'rr45U Here again is the curious similarity to French folksongs. Readers who recall the first tune used by Ethel Smyth in 'Two Interlinked French Melodies' will see how the first phrases of Ex. 3 follow the same pattern. These similarities cannot be dismissed with the airy half truth that " folksongs are much the same all over the world ", though many folksongs I have heard here have been woven round the. hexachord; I find them as uninteresting, when a number are sung in succession, as the Hebridean songs which they resemble. Their form is usually elementary, the AABB or AABA or AABBCC phrases repeating without the spice of variation. A good exception is this: Ex.4 J l,jjJ3__j'lo : 11 f l, jI JJ J-J J j : 11 Instead of melodies eternally moving up and down the notes C-A- G-E-D-C (the descending order), with an occasional Bb, I should like to record one of the more advanced specimens, though I cannot remember it completely: Ex. 5 J _ !

Indian tabla players seem able to give the right contribution to melodies which we could write down only by an unattractive chain of time-signatures-4-4, 3-4, 5-4, &amp;c. It was not till billeted near Jessore that I heard Bengali classical music, except by gramophone. The difference is far more important than that between recorded and direct listening in England; still more important is the need for a small, intimate circle and complete chamber- music conditions. Mozart's Sunday quartetting may be a near parallel, but even a Schubertiad was more of a concert than Indian classidal gatherings. It is hard to call the listeners an audience, so close is their liaison with the players. Each, like Pope's spider " feels at each thread, and lives along the line ". It is a pity that so many European visitors hear and see music and dancing in displays given in halls or theatres: it were better not to hear or see it at all than in these conditions. On the night of my initiation I had opportunity to compare popular with professional standards. At about ten o'clock there was flute playing, songs with choruses and the tap of tabla in a house whose lamp I could see from my billet. I went to look through the door without entering and found a rickshaw man I knew standing near me in the darkness. Rickshaws in Bengal are propelled by a cycle attachment. Only in the capital are they pulled. By what stupidity a cycle rickshaw is thought more dangerous in traffic than the pulled type I do not know. It is to the disgrace of a civilized nation that men should be employed upon work which gives them a shockingly low expectation of life; the alternate sweating and resting, or going to remove sweat at a pump while still heated, above all the fact that rickshaws are most in demand when Calcutta's climate is most hot and humid-these things play havoc with the rickshaw man's heart and lungs. I asked my rickshaw man what was forward. A puja ? No, this was a Muslim house. A wedding ? No. "Just a kismis ". For some days I went about feeling knowledgeable in the acquisition of this word and asked where I might hear another kismis. I used it for the last time to my most intimate Bengali friend, Moni Majumdar, who, as book-chooser and secretary to the local library, had been a walking book of reference for me on both his own literature and ours. (People in quite modest circumstances in these mofussil towns can be found reading modern English prose, poetry and drama. Curiously their favourite seems to be Somerset Maugham; still more curious, they enjoy the pen-trailing of B. Nichols, Esq., even to the work which might be called the glaring exception, but for the fact that whereas the rest of India seems to be annoyed, Bengal reads whole passages aloud for the sake of a good laugh.) My mistake was found out when Moni bid me recall the place and time, and the speaker from whom I had learnt this technical term. It appears 34</page><page sequence="10">MUSIC IN BENGAL that the rickshaw man's stratum of society, always cheeky and curious when any party is forward, had witnessed the annual stuffing, guzzling and singing which marks an R.A.F. puja. Such a jollification was there- fore " A Christmas" or kismis. I went from the "kismis ", with music no finer nor cruder than the songs heard in Belpukur and Dhubulia villages, to the house of the homoeopathic doctor, Lolit Mukherji. Classical music was to be given at about eleven o'clock by four musicians who had studied at the Morris School, Lucknow. We all sat in an upper room with white walls and no furniture except the white carpet and elbow bolsters. The arrange- ment well outlined the shapes of the instruments and the players' move- ments. First we had voice, pure voice, to no words but the syllables of the Indian solfege-sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, &amp;c. I had thought Roy's the pleasantest Indian voice I had so far heard, but what a difference recording makes to music which depends so much upon appreciation of the basic elements of the art, shown to a degree of perfection which we have sacrificed, rightly too for the particular glories of our type of music. The populace admire the voice of a film artist, Saighal, a sort of Paul Robeson. He is not a Bengali, and I therefore heard him in a Hindi film about Tansen, Akbar's court musician, who is supposed to have transcended the conservatism of his day and convinced others of the rightness of advance by the beauty of his own art. Alas for Tansen ! Saighal's voice is rich enough in tone, but he was made to sing the most appalling hybrid rubbish in which just temperament and the aspects essential to the best Indian were sacrificed to no avail, since the western elements in this stuff were merely poor harmonies and progressions " encumbering what it was not in their power.to fertilize ". The singer at Dr. Mukherji's late-night gathering first extended the right hand, palm up towards a point in the air directly in front of his eyes. For a classical musician the pure sound, to the solfa names, is as significant and interesting as that set to poetry, as one could tell by the tense silence. What he sang was a vocalise, Ex. 6, wherein the European could but admire the tone, the mastery of ornament, always to the vowel " a ", the perfection of intervals at presto pace and the control of long-held notes : Ex.6 2JJd d J J rr l rsr 11 nJW j j ,jSr f j ( .W'I( I r' Obvious were the results of long and assiduous study, as obvious as the modern scamping of a long apprenticeship in technics in the west when we hear the opposite results from a Schumann or a Kipnis. The singer, Sarajit Kanjilal, was tolerantly jocose at my liking for the wedding of music and poetry, and horrified at my liking for certain Bengali film songs. There is a " film problem " in Bengal, for the cinema, whatever its failure to seize opportunities, is a modern form of art that appeals to an art-loving people. The amount of song and music in the usual film is excessive by our standards. I hope later on to quote some film songs that will make the reader understand why I think the Indian classical musician is a bit of a snob. But even Dilip Kumar Roy, whose knowledge of western music makes him almost the only Bengali musician from whom I can get difficulties explained in the technical terms I 35 Vol. XXVII C</page><page sequence="11">MUSIC AND LETTERS understand, graciously wrote from the Sri Aurobindo Asram in answer to several of my queries. In his letters he says: Though Bengal had the imagination to grasp the essential message of the classical inspiration, . . . it would be untrue to say, echoing a handful of classical dilettantes, that the musical heart of Bengal cquld ever be given to music minus words. And again: " The past music, great though it was, was not great enough in the sphere of song." The singer at Dr. Mukherji's was followed by the virtuosic chittar playing of one Amar Mozoomdar, whom I cannot but suppose to be a well-known exponent of his art. The company, which had been serious during the singing, shared this chittar player's smile and broadened with him to grinning as the variations became more brilliant. The playing of one variation obviously excited the player to greater and greater invention. The third type of music that night was a sedate combination of chittar, singara and tabla. The resonance of the chittars, including a fine bass one, the open string at the octave or fifth distinctly sounding as a measure of the upper intervals, cannot be imagined by those who have not heard them. They are quite unlike western instru- ments of their type, either Hawaiian guitars or the tinny thing they bring out in ' Hary Janos '. They are like a harpsichord in tone. The singara has its nearest approximation in the tenor viols whose rich, clear ensemble I last heard when the Busch players performed the sixth Brandenburg Concerto. Again there was great artistry in the variations. I could marvel at the ability of these players in making intensely interesting music by unprepared improvisation. I may be wrong here, through not knowing whether, perhaps embedded in the apprenticeship of such musicians, there is or is not some degree of preparation. Dr. Roy says that the constant practice of disciplined improvisation is the feature of classical music least comprehensible to western minds, but I feel sure that he does us less than justice when he says that we can admire but not love it. Much Hindi and some Bengali music I cannot pretend even to like, let alone love, but I am as certain that Mr. Nichols did not hear music like this as I am that he has sufficient musical knowledge and sincerity to have passed a very different verdict had he been present with us. In order to hear more of it I bought some records of a similar trio- Dakshina Tagore, Jnan Ghosh and Sujit Nath-and with these records I hope to prove my words when I rejoin English friends. But let the cold wind of frankness blow upon these enthusiasms. After hearing several of my new records I happened to put on Rimsky-Korsakov's overture to ' Ivan the Terrible '; though this may not be R.-K.'s best work, and though R.-K. is a brilliant rather than a profound writer, the magnificence of orchestration in music that was part of my own cultural heritage made me unwilling to hear any more Indian music at that sitting. The cheapest and therefore most ubiquitous instrument in Bengal is the transverse flute, though I have seen the flute a bec. Whether played by a schoolboy, an old farmer after the day's work or a first- rate performer, the transverse flute is always 15 in. long, i in. in diameter and tuned in our scale of C. Of this I am certain, being blessed with absolute pitch, and cursed with it when people with a craze for speed return my gramophone after tampering with it or when Calcutta radio returns to its old bad ways. I say " returns " because periodically I write to the Englishman in charge, and to the one at Delhi; a nice answer comes back; they find me correct and, for at least two days, 36</page><page sequence="12">MUSIC IN BENGAL music comes over at Philharmonic pitch. But gremlins do not leave the speed-indicator. Flute tone is one of the hardest of which to tire if music must be heard in quantity, and it was a happy day in which we introduced schoolboys to the bamboo pipe which they could make for themselves and practise without nuisance to neighbours. The Bengal flutes do not sound like recorders or bamboo pipes, but like what we call flutes at home, only softer. They cost eight annas in a shop, which fits a metal ring at each end, but most people make their own, bamboo bushes being like blackberries at home for quantity. Jessore's best flute player is the cinema-procession man who passes my door at 9 each morning. His first fine careless rapture is hardly classical raga, but proceeds by impro- visation on the theme. I am able to hear the work from its beginning as the procession forms up at the end of our lane before going round the town. It consists of the flute player, flanked or followed by children like the Pied Piper, a man with a poster made by the cinema proprietor daily and hoisted by string on a bamboo pole, and a man with a noisy side-drum played with sticks. Sometimes a rickshaw man chooses to give all three processionists a ride, while the band still plays, and on rainy days all get into a rickshaw, and the man with the banner is made to hold an umbrella over the flautist, the drummer and his own placard, and another umbrella over the rickshaw pedaller. As the conveyance jolts over Jessore's monsoon-ravaged roads, it is usually an extra large puddle that upsets the banner first. Here is to-day's overture: Ex. 7 r rr ! rrrr- rT 11I I have been told that this soft instrument was a favourite here in classical days when reed instruments were liked in the rest of India, although I have heard some brilliant flute playing in the Punjab. In Bengal the difficulty is not to hear flute playing somewhere at any part of the day, and the preference in tone may be the result of a soft climate and timid nature, for Bengali sarees favour the soft colours we like ourselves, whereas on the hot plains you may see flaming scarlets and yellows. As I write, a little stall-keeper opposite my billet is fluting for customers. I make no apology for a digression that tells about him, for he well illustrates the innate Bengali love of art. Kesto, Bengali synonym for Krishna, had a good education, and is able to write letters for rice-men and others when supply officers and other curses of this red-tape-pestered land demand applications in English. He was once a fine footballer. Football is markedly the favourite national game-a fact which again contradicts the generalization about timidity, for in the first place almost everybody plays, and the sport is not entirely professionalized, and in the second place, though you may see barefoot playing elsewhere, it is only in Bengal that a first-rank professional team goes out barefoot against other teams, and usually wins. The townees of little Jessore beat a heavily weighted and booted R.A.F. team this week, and went from the pitch down the town streets with drum banging, fluting and rickshaw-hoisting of the heroes. So strong is Bengali nationalism that you may see the game sometimes played not in shorts but in a hitched-up dhoti, the player holding up the end like a girl lifting a skirt to avoid soiling it in a puddle. A bad fault of the educated Bengali is his inability to think beyond the interests of his own province. A " new and great 37</page><page sequence="13">MUSIC AND LETTERS India " really means the apotheosis of Bengal, and this dhoti playing is an expression of provincial chauvinism. The barefoot Calcutta games are murderous, and often as dirty as Bengal politics. Still Bengal arts, and not Bengal morality, are the themes of my song, and does not Mr. Herbert tell us: And what my poor old father said in 1863 Is once we begin on all this art Farewell moralitee. Football is played throughout the year, and Badminton in the garden or field as a mild relaxation. Cricket does not seem to be known in this land of poverty, for apparatus and maintenance of ground would be costly. So quickly do the jungles grow and so sodden the fields become that the football pitch has to be changed frequently during the rainy season. To return to Kesto; he had an accident at the age of eighteen after which paralysis took away the use of his legs. Occasionally the rickshaw men lift him into a vehicle and take him to the pictures. His shop sells the little cigarettes called bidi, betel leaf, its preparation with lime and spices called pan, glasses of tea for the rickshaw men, who are as fond of that beverage as London drivers, lime juice and knick-knacks like combs and bangles, which go in pairs, one for each arm. Being forced always to sit, Kesto has developed pencil sketching, water and oil painting, embroidery and playing upon the flute and chittar. While on the former he will regale customers with popular songs and those from the cinema; his taste upon the noble chittar is classical, and I give here the opening of a very slow and stately saraband which is a favourite with him: Ex.8 - Second strophe i@ Lt$a r r -i Fl ll4 .J J tI ^fl6? drone bass Why should this Bengali music be more acceptable than other eastern music to English musicians ? One Bengali tells you that i comes from Aryan elements in Hindu Bengali blood, while another says this theory is the invention of Brahmins who want to pretend they maintained racial purity against the Muslim invader. The similarities are there even when the mode is not one from our tabulations, for we can accept any mode that does not stray too far from one of the Gregorian scales-in fact almost any mode which uses an octave of notes-once we have let it sink into our perception. Maybe geography and racial mixture has had its influence. The first Bengali film I saw provided music which opened my ears more than any I have heard out here, and my specimen from it will show western readers why. The film, called 'The Uphill Path ' (Oudayer pathey), opened with a scene in which the wife of a struggling writer was invited to the party given by a former schoolmate in the Ballygunge quarter of Calcutta. People of western pretensions were invited and, despite censorship, English civil servants and notables with pith hats (Bengali has no head dress except the cones of the paddy fields) were made to appear pompous and ridiculous; the rich babus did some over-acted boot-licking. As happens in most bourgeois homes, the young ladies were expected to entertain with accompanied song; as usual the harmonium was opened. This is usually a small one without pedals which is put on the floor and played stiff-fingered by the left hand while the saree drapes prettily forward and the right hand reaches to the back 38</page><page sequence="14">MUSIC IN BENGAL of the instrument to work the flat bellows to and fro. The hand-flapping is very attractive; the sound is horrible. The harmonium paces the voice at unison or octave, like the clarinet in cheap opera performances, spoiling the girl's voice and robbing the song of its rhythm. One cannot blame the fond parents, for a generation ago, before Bengal took pride in her own beautiful dress and artistic heritage, and before Tagore had condemned the harmonium with other western vices, it was as fashion- able to be knowledgeable about the western keyboard as to become a Christian; if a keyboard had to be acquired, the piano, expensive and awkward to transport in a land where it is difficult to move anything that will not go by water or bullock cart, was less acceptable and less traditional than the small harmonium, standing not a foot above the floor and not looking so incongruous as would a piano in the cool austerity of a Bengali home. In spite of these reasons, it is probable that less sensitive ears, wishing to go west, thought the reed sound to be well in their own tradition. Bengali musicians of to-day condemn the harmonium and are successfully banishing it from all truly musical households. In the film great play was made of the presents brought by guests to the Ballygunge party. The nice poor girl brought some embroidery of her own making; the nasty rich ones brought vulgar sarees and western gifts from Calcutta shops. Still more careful was the musical contrast. The nasty rich girls sang vapid hybrids compared with which ' Madama Butterfly' is chaste; the nice poor girl sang some Tagore songs. She sat at a monster harmonium which needed only the grinning rows of teeth- it had two rows-and the lift from the cellars with coloured lights to become a worthy rival to the Ogre of the Odeon at Oundle. But the film director substituted in his sound-track the original beauty of chittars and singara. Here is the opening of one of the songs: Ex. 9a Ex. 9a Singara 1r etc.J-^ r 1, c VoiceAi malo-ti la - ta do - le,do-le, pi - alto-ru and the moving shift between "major " and "minor " at a later point in the same lyric: Ex. b[2nd strophe] gb JJJj &lt;L _ J_J)^l J j J 10}c L - r r r J The singer, Binota Bose, had a fine contralto voice, more nasal and more portamento than we usually like in our fondness for all things velvety. 39</page><page sequence="15">MUSIC AND LETTERS In these art-songs, as in the folksongs, musica ficta and the different ascending from descending scale are seen alive: no grammarian's rule or theorist's historical observation, they are the free and natural choice of the singers or players. What English critic, served with Ex. ga as the opening of a scherzo or allegretto in a new symphony, would fail to be impressed ? Yet the very things we admire in such a piece may not be of any significance to the Indian classicist. When I confessed my liking for this song to the singer at Dr. Mukherji's, he said : " Yes, yes., You Europeans are always taking in and thinking about something else than pure music. You do not even know purity of sound, for I have tested you ". On the other hand, that very song was a favourite among ladies before I heard it in the film. I hummed the tune to a certain lady just after hearing the film, and it was she who taught me the words and their meaning and the proper way to sing them. This brings me to my final digression. Though purdah, if not strict, is kept among town Muslims of Bengal, so far as Hindu village wives are concerned, and still more the increasingly literate and often highly educated women of the towns-girls having gone to schools, elementary and secondary, in Bengal for the past few generations-stories of the seclusion of women are as far-fetched as the yarn that Brahmin and low-caste boys do not sit in the same class for instruction and play football together afterwards. The externals of caste are maintained at pilgrimage places like Nabwadip, on a Ganges island, and even in free-thinking, theist Jessore or Comilla, to mention two townships I know well; and when summer weather makes citizens promenade stripped to the waist, certain Brahmins are the first to shed shirts or punjabis and expose the sacred thread. It is true that ladies have a studied self-effacement at one's first meeting, for this modesty is a sign of breeding, distinguishing the lady from the coolie-woman; but reserve disappears at one's second visit, especially when heated argument begins. I have been entertained and fed by the fair sex in several households while the bread-winner was winning, and I am indebted to the ladies in general for teaching me " poetic songs ", as I am to Dr. Roy for his patient attempt to tell me, while wishing me well in my search, those appreciations of classical style that he feels we cannot truly share with his compatriots. Bengali ladies are literally .fair in comparison with those from many other parts of India. At the weddings I attended, village or town, I never found the bride to be below the age of nineteen, though the law allows the first betrothal arrangements to be made at sixteen. Marriages are arranged by parents, but the bride has the right of choice. Whether or not she invariably sees her husband's virtues with her parent's eyes I do not know-there may be the equivalent of Sheridan comedies in Bengal-but I have seen no modern drama yet. What I can declare is that, either in all the families I have known husband and wife are amazing actors, or else there has been a deeper bond between them than the " mutual help and comfort" enjoined by the marriage service in England. After all, were there any more misalliances in the eighteenth century than in days when we may act upon the first promptings of infatuation ? The Bengali mother is fully mistress of the house and I have heard Baba rebuked for smoking one of my cheroots " in the room where we are going to eat ", and for "spoiling the children", who seem to fear their mother's rather than their father's displeasure. Moreover the simple way of brushing the hair back from the temples into a neat " bun ", the quiet movements of bare lacquered footsoles and the grace of a simple saree give women a Madonna-like loveliness which shows up badly the silly, unwomanly coiffures and hats of certain Calcutta ladies, who 40</page><page sequence="16">MUSIC IN BENGAL are not to blame for the cruel effect of this climate on some types of European complexion. I brought in the ladies partly out of gratitude and partly because they like music with words. Do they, then, find difficulty in absorbing pure sound, without evocations? What is the difference between English reactions to, say, the Bloch Quintet, especially its last heavenly pages, and to the many specimens of non-classical Bengali music which I would quote if there were space, though the instrumental introduction to " Ai malati " will show my point ? And what is the difference between our reactions and those of Indians ? I cannot explain, but I will try to bring witnesses to my final wrestlings, noting that I shall keep to my plan of avoiding any Indian technical terms. Wordsworth had a nice taste in music, I believe; but, being a poet, he may have been like so many of our poets and delighted in his own or the composer's pictures and evocations rather than in the sheer sound. We have no proof that this is true of Wordsworth, any more than of Milton or Bridges, to mention two poets at extremes of history who knew quite well what they were talking about in a musical dis- cussion. But had Wordsworth wagged a didactic finger at us and declared that we should find more beauty and interest in the song of his solitary reaper than in the ninth Symphony, we should class him with the pompous twaddler who solemnly assures a congregation that a violet is more beautiful and interesting than a flaming dawn. This smug fellow is of a very different type from the mystic Blake who speaks of holding " infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour ". Now it is precisely one of the pundits mentioned above-he has senti- mentalized over the single flower in more than one place-who rushes in where learned European musicians have feared to tread and fails to recognize that India turned the spectroscope on music while we used the telescope, and that they may find in music something of Blake's experience. I do not pretend to understand how Dr. Roy can retire to a monastery and tell me in a letter that I cannot be interested, surely, in what he, as an initiate of yoga, finds his greatest interest, namely the spiritual appeal of music at its highest, any more than I can follow the writings and actions of the great Bengali mystics in whose steps he has decided to follow; but I should be an ass if I dismissed his attitude as nonsense, for the same man can inform me of musical matters in as precise terms as the following: "I would ask you not to waste time on the quarter- tone problem. It's all moonshine. We use the quarter-tones very rarely, if at all, and only in legato movements ." Another recluse, held to be a man of great mystical perception, told me: You English people love to talk about the " mysterious east," probably thinking that mysticism and mysteriousness are synonymous. Believe me, we Bengalis, who have taken to the path of mysticism more perhaps than other Indians, are cunning practical men. I will not mention another nation who is perhaps our master in these respects, but that nation has produced some great mystics, whose experiences we revere though they obtained them from very different instruments of grace. My knowledge of Asiatic music " as I found it " must be judged by the fact that even Fox Strangways's ' Music of Hindostan' is for me as much a task as a pleasure in the reading. Dr. Roy's letter, cited above, in reply to my first enthusiasm over music which I was enjoying by western standards, added: Because you have come to love our Bengali music which is still my grande passion, I have not been able to change my opinion that we cannot find it easy to love your music any more than you can ours, or that you can really acquire that insight that is of the greatest value in our music. 41</page><page sequence="17">MUSIC AND LETTERS Shall I dismiss this opinion by ranking it with Schweitzer's attitude to Bach, denounced as heresy by a contributor to ' Music &amp; Letters ? ' " It is our way of expressing emotion through the medium of constant improvisation which I feel would prove the chief stumbling-block ". Not entirely so. Though I may not have " that insight ", any musician who can drink in .the beauty of Bloch's cello cadenza in ' Schelomo' can find much to fascinate him in the burgeoning of the first pure notes of an austere rag by a single flute or cittar, unspoiled by equal temper- ament. Yet the first song I heard from Dilip Roy's records is labelled ' Bengali Devotional '. Let the quotation of its refrain illustrate the point that we do not hear with their ears: Ex. 10 E j4 rJ, j ,11 do'jJ. J J,J t .J ;-j t J .l-,l l, ...:I - . H If that is devotional, says my reader, the devotion is of a highly Franciscan order. It sounds as much like a French folksong as does " Choto kothai ? " quoted above. Now I can no more blame Mr. Nichols's inability to perceive the spiritual content of Indian music than I can blame myself, though he does not seem to have gone far to look for the best. Perhaps in an arranged tour one comes across only the public performance, which I have said can never convey the beauties, let alone the hidden content, of this art. That Nichols was irked by India's more superficial and obvious sores is neither here nor there. I myself could mention without malice far worse sores than he records and feel that in straining at irritating gnats he has missed huge camelious obstructions. I am glad, however, that I was sent out as no public figure, nor even musical scribbler, and had to know the people and their homes with some intimacy even to gather my small gleanings. Could one, however, too strongly condemn the vaunting of one's failures or rejoice in the inability to find the best, though the lack of opportunity was not of one's choosing ? Surely this is like the boasting of a stupid young soldier, English or American, sent into the forces before he knows better than to hurt the feelings of people in whose country he finds himself-the sort of man who brandishes a bottle in the street, calls out to girls and thus advertises his winebibbing or lechery. Whether these two natural desires are vicious in fulfilment, or whether their gratification is harmless to character, they are matters which the gentleman settles privately, not coram populo; thus also should he settle his negligences and ignorances. Bengali art and music are no more simple than English art and music, and simpletons alone make simpleness the prime quality of art. Music especially is esoteric, being the art wherein personality and things intangible and inexplicable are most readily communicated. Other arts portray or describe; music conveys; and it is just the inner content of Bengali music which Roy feels that one can hardly exchange with or add to one's inner perception of English music, unless one undergoes reincarnation as a Hindu. With vagueness and vagaries, muddled and contradictory arguments and the inefficiencies that we, the children of Greece and Rome, find among Indians, they have a spiritual treasure laid up that we cannot even savour in the three or four years of a military tour. Their music is religious; ours impassioned. The Indian takes up his instrument like a humble servant while few of us, whatever lips utter in church or speech, think primarily of humility as an attribute of deity. But among Asiatic mystics who do recognize the fact, 42</page><page sequence="18">MUSIC IN BENGAL none shines more brightly than any one of the Bengali galaxy. That there is plenty of mysterious verbiage in India as at home and in America the recluse I mentioned above admits, but as he points out, the great mystics, like Blake at one extreme, or Vivekananda at the other, are shrewd, clear-thinking people forced to use the language of symbolism to convey what Evelyn Underhill tells us is " as incommunicable except by direct experience as is the odour of the violet ", and Roy happens to find music the most powerful of symbolic languages. The mystics have been called " the madmen of God ", and how cunning a madman can be it takes Shakespeare to show us. Is the spiritual search helped by technical study ? Why not ? Perfection in knowing the symbols cannot retard perception of the substance, for if the symbols fascinate by their mystery, our mind may fail to see beyond. I do not suppose that every Indian mystic, or even many of them, can share Roy's experience through music. We have among our mystics those for whom the symbols were traditionally religious, those who found them provided by nature and the open air, and those for whom the symbolism of words and ideas, the technique of philosophy, opened the gate of perception. What does it matter if the means be the stigmata, a cow walking on her hind legs, a button sewn on a cloud or, as for Ramakrishna, the vivification of Kali the Destroyer, terrible as the vision of Mary at her Assumption: " Quae est ista quae progreditur quasi Aurora consurgens, pulchra ut Luna, electa ut Sol, terribilis ut castrorum acies ordinata ? " In almost these terms did Ramakrishna address the Divine Mother. The psalms of Jewry are still the solace of the soul, in rapture or torture, for while Rome gave order and Greece knowledge, Jewry, farther east, bequeathed to the west our greatest legacy of spiritual experience. That nation was truly the chosen of God. What is our business efficiency, our economy of time, if a man believes in a life that is timeless, making him but a stranger and pilgrim here ? Let any man not spiritually dead by all means test his faith with reason; but let the faith be catholicism, pantheism or materialism (India defines a materialist as one who finds symbolism only in science), be its followers doers of charity or recluses, no faith has any meaning unless it finds the unseen to be reality and our " real " things only symbols. India knew this before the Christian mystics, and she therefore evolved the only faith that has never persecuted another, nor wished that any man should follow the light of his destiny through any but his own symbols of revelation-in one place Rama and Krishna, in another Vishnu or Siva, in another Durga and Kali, and in another Buddha or Jesus. India says: ." You are right though you seem to do wrong, so long as your motive was right ", but so unwise are we in these matters that we repeat a wretched adage about the road to hell being paved with good intentions. Concede that their cleanlinesses are our uncleanlinesses, their valued things our despised (they despise nothing), that they are ashamed of what we make public and make open what we hide: concede even that, during our short stay, we have met mean and petty Bengalis, the cruel men for whose part in the famine-exploitation Nehru expressed shame. Facing us are Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Ram Mohun Roy, Tagore, the Chatterjis, Prafulla Ray-seekers through devotion, the arts, the sciences. These are the giants, rather than those who raised mausoleums to their own glory and ground India with whips and scorpions, as did the worst zamindars of Bengal in.a past generation. What is possible from one Bengali is "possible from another, and though 43</page><page sequence="19">MUSIC AND LETTERS we may look a thousand years ahead, who knows that the artist may not be born with faith and vision to advance both western and eastern expression to fresh beauty, in which process Indian music may retain her conservatism without its retrograde elements, and western music be purified by fertilization, laying up inward treasure as well as her present superficial richness ? A postscript to this article, in which the author discusses some matters experienced after it was written, has come to hand too late for publication in this issue. It will appear in the April number.-ED. A CHECK-LIST OF BEETHOVEN'S CHAMBER MUSIC BY DONALD W. MACARDLE I "If you steal from one author, it's plagiarism; if you steal from many, it's research." 1 IN the preparation of this List, the objective which was set up (too idealistic to be attained) was the tabulation of all chamber works which could be ascribed to Beethoven, with data (adequately documented) as to date of composition, of first performance and of publication, and with definite identification of each work by citation of its publication in some standard edition or journal, by reference to the location and catalogue number of unpublished manuscripts or by other suitable means. One of the first policies to be determined was, What should be taken as the meaning of the phrase, "works which could be ascribed to Beet- hoven "? From this standpoint the compositions listed herein fall in general into four classes: ?(I) Compositions certainly or probably by Beethoven, and currently extant in their original arrangement. (2) Transcriptions of chamber works by Beethoven, of which the original version has not been preserved. (The' Letzter Musika- lischer Gedanke'-#85 in the List-is the only composition under this classification, though NOTE 5 refers to certain Dances for pianoforte solo which are almost certainly transcriptions from lost originals for two violins and bass.) (3) Transcriptions for chamber groups which were certainly or probably made, revised or approved by Beethoven. (4) Transcriptions published during Beethoven's lifetime under what purported to be a Beethoven opus number. It will be evident to any user of this List that there is much work still to be done on it. In particular, it is believed that the value of the List would be enhanced by more data regarding modern editions of the less well-known compositions or transcriptions, and by additional informa- tion regarding works still in manuscript. Lacunae such as those disclosed by the discussion of #20, #42, #82 or #83, or in NOTES 4, 7, 9 or 10, are crying out to be filled. Certain important reference books and journals 1 Discovered by research in Bennet Cerf's' Try and Stop Me,' for which Wilson Mizner was plagiarized. 44</page></plain_text>
