Introduction* By now, it has come to be recognized that the explanation of many of the ancient Mayan funerary representations will have to be in terms of mythology and that this mythology by no means can be restricted to the Popol Vuh alone (cf. Coe 1982: 11; Robicsek 1981: 7?8). The emphasis originally laid by M. D. Coe on the mythology of the hero-brothers Hun Ah Pu and Xbalanque is still justified, however, in those instances where one finds the so-called Headband God among the participants in a vase configuration. Coe's hypothesis that this deity is identical with (Hun) Ah Pu, "(One) Blowgunner", has not been countered with effective arguments and is there fore, to my mind, still entirely acceptable. In the Popol Vuh, "One Blowgunner" turns out to be a solar hero. At the end of the purely mythological part of this dynastic chronicle, it is stated that of the two brothers, "one is the sun, and the other of them is the moon" (4699?4700). As the fixed order is Hun Ah Pu ? Xbalanque throughout, Hun Ah Pu appears to be the sun, Xbalanque the moon. This agrees with the fact that in the mythology of the Kekchi Mayas, the same hero with the blowgun is simply called "Sun". Moreover, Xbalanque is also equated with the sun here, which suggests that the sun ? moon division constitutes a secondary elaboration of the Quiches (cf. Thompson 1970: 234, 372). * I wish to thank J. van der Vliet, M. A., and the Doctors D. Kelley, U. Kohler, B. Riese and especially R. A.

I am deeply indebted to A. M. J. Zijlstra for his friendship and encouragement.</page><page sequence="2">238 H.E.M.Braakhuis Of the Sun Hero mythology, two main traditions can be found. One of these is contained in the Popol Vuh. The other one, which exhibits considerable diver gences, appears to be wide-spread but is in its entirety best known from the Kekchis. Coe has left this other tradition out of consideration, while the late J. E. S. Thompson, on the contrary, has repeatedly emphasized its importance. In order to find evidence for the circulation of his favourite myth, and of its final episode in particular, during the Classic Period, Thompson turned to funerary vases (1939: 150?151; 1970: 367?368), just as Coe has done for the myth of his own predilection. Unfortunately, the representations which Thompson tried to decipher did not offer sufficient detail to secure their identification and to allow one to draw further conclusions from them, i. e. to assess the function of the mythical episode during the Classic Period. There exists, however, a vase representation that does provide such an opportunity. It has been reproduced in the Princeton catalogue, "Lords of the Underworld", and has received some comment from M. D. Coe, who could not, however, find a clear connection with the Popol Vuh (1978: 58?63). I intend to argue that an analysis of this representation will enable us both to justify Coe's contention that the trials of the Blowgunner served as a "paradigm for the death and apotheosis of Maya rulers" (1975b: 91) and to establish the crucial function which this particular episode from the Kekchi myth fulfilled within the ritual-calendarial system of the Classic Period.1 2. The explanatory myth Thompson has given the following outline of the Sun Hero myth, as it occurs with, amongst others, the Kekchis (1970: 355?369): (1) Death of Old Woman, (2) Perils of Tree Climbing, (3) Sun Courts Moon and (4) Moon's Adultery. The basis for this outline has probably been one of the most complete versions, which he recorded himself in the village of San Antonio, in what is now Belize, and published under the title "The Legend of the Sun, the Moon, and Venus" (1930: 119?140). The term "Legend" refers to the "Leyenda de los Soles", an important XVIth century Mexican myth, which in various respects is comparable with the Kekchi tale (Thompson 1930:137, cf. 1970: 330?373). In 1970, Thompson described this version as "Mopan" (363), apparently because it stemmed from a village with a Mopan speaking majority. Nevertheless, around 1930, he still considered it, not unreason ably, as Kekchi: two of the four informants were born Kekchis and the third was, although Yucatec-speaking, of Kekchi descent. The fourth is supposed to have shown "Kekchi features" in the face (135). All in all, the version recorded by Thompson probably was a Kekchi one. 1 Other levels of interpretation of the vase scenes (rain ritual, astrology, healing) will be considered in my thesis on the Mayan Sun Hero (or Twin) mythology.</page><page sequence="3">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 239 The episode from the Kekchi myth which will be studied is the fourth and final one (Moon's Adultery). The two most detailed versions of this episode are the one from San Antonio, Belize, given by Thompson (1930: 129?132) and that from Senahu, Alta Verapaz, given by Cruz Torres (1965: 47?70, cf. the summary by Becker Donner 1976). The two versions have an identical structure and correspond in many details. However, there is a striking difference on one main point: in the San Antonio version, Sun's brother is a Venus god called Xulab, but in the Senahu ver sion he is a water- and rain deity called Choc, "Cloud". The fourth episode accord ing to Thompson and Cruz Torres can be summarized as follows: 1 ? The unmarried brother of Sun commits adultery with Sun's wife, the moon goddess (TH: brother Xulab; CT: brother Choc). 2 ? Sun induces the separation of the adulterers by causing a quarrel. 3 ? The moon goddess allows herself to be kidnapped by a vulture and becomes the wife of the King of the Vultures (TH: in the city of the King of the Vul tures; CT: in the kingdom of [X]balba). 4 ? Sun struggles with his brother and defeats him (CT only). 5 ? Sun borrows the skin of the deer and hides beneath it (TH: antelope, later: deer; CT: chiuc, el cabro2). 6 ? Insect helpers give the skin an appearance which is attractive to the vultures (TH: by putting on it the substance which turns into worms; CT: by salting it). 7 ? Sun allows himself to be kidnapped by the vultures (TH: tsom, sopilote; CT: maalkaan, "widow", black vulture with a red head). 8 ? Sun defeats the King of the Vultures (TH: a devil, variant: the king vulture; CT: Mausajcuink, the devil). 9 ? Sun and Moon ascend to the heavens from a great bonfire (TH var.; CT). 3. Iconographic identification Before looking at the vase representation in terms of this series of events, it is necessary to be sure of the iconographic identity of the vase figures, without any reference to the myth. The existing descriptions are neither complete nor entirely correct (cf. Coe 1978: 58?62; Robicsek 1978: 147?149). The present description is based on the colour photograph proyided by Coe (1978: pi. 8). Starting below the first glyphs of the Primary Standard Text along the rim, we have: 2 Chiuc may correspond to Yucatec yuk, a small deer (Mazama pandora). Cf.: "There are wild goats which the Indians call yuc. They have only two horns like goats and are not as large as deer" (Tozzer 1941: n. 1134).</page><page sequence="4">240 H.E.M.Braakhuis 1. A puma head. The head is of a predatory cat. Since the typical spots of the jaguar are lacking, and also in view of the light brown colour, it is clearly the head of a puma. The puma appears to be alive. Still, it has a red spot on the cheek, comparable with the black spot on the cheeks of the dog and the Headband God. These black spots indicate agony or death. 2. Deer-carcass. The body is that of a white-tailed deer, as is indicated by the follow ing characteristics: (a) the rounded form, similar to that of the speared deer on Dresden Codex (henceforth D. C.) XXX; (b) the white underside of the legs; (c) the hooves, a short one and two longer, pointing in the same direction (while the jaguar or puma is always depicted with thick, lumpy paws having one of the claws opposed)3; (d) the white tail4. The right fore-leg is crossed underneath the left, a peculiarity especially reminiscent of the right crouching bearer on the Palencan Tablet of the Slaves, which happens to be also a deer (Schele 1979: figs. 13 n, 16). The body of the white-tailed deer on the vase is greatly swollen, very evident in the legs ? usually rather slender ?, the hooves have grown extremely long and where a deer's head should appear, one finds blood dripping downwards instead. These are all characteristics of a carcass, possibly that of a prey. 3. Insects. Sitting on the deer-carcass are two small naked creatures with thin, spidery limbs. In their size, overall outline, and the three "death-eyes" on the skull5, they are identical with the flying insect on a codical vase (Robicsek 1981: no. 21, cf. nos. 19?20). This last creature is clearly recognizable as an insect by the presence of wings and an insect-like abdomen. However, its face exhibits the features of death god A'6, while the characteristics of the insects on the present vase ? the particular form of the skull and the wrinkles on the forehead ? appear to point to another deity, the old god N.7 The liquid streaming from their mouths provides a further dis tinguishing mark. 3 Examples of deer hooves, conventionally elongated: C. M. XLII, XLIV ff./Coe 1982: no. 12 fig. 4/ Kubler 1969: figs. 46, 47/Robicsek 1981: nos. 14, 140. 4 For the tail of the deer, cf.: C. M. XXXVIII ff./Coe 1973: no. 66/Robicsek 1982: no. 8, p. 33. 5 The three "death-eyes" on the skull are a constant attribute of the death gods A and A' in the Dresden Codex. On the vases 19 ff. (Robicsek 1981), god A has two little "death-eyes" on each side of the skull, just as the insects on nos. 19?20. The attribute has, however, a wider application, as can be seen on nos. 50 (with a human victim) and 51 (with a jaguar-spotted rodent). 6 Attributes of death god A' (D. C. V b 3, VI a 3, XXVIII b): akbal-forehead, "percentage-sign" on cheek. From D. C. XXVIII b, this god can be identified as Uac Mitun Ahau (see Thompson 1972: 172). On this same page, his pictogram ? lower jaw lacking, two protruding teeth in the upper jaw ? bears resemblance to the heads of the insects on the deer-carcass and also ? in view of the atrophy of their lower jaws ? to the death god A' insects. (I see no reason to accept Coe's identification of these last insects as fire-flies as long as their death god A' characteristics remain unaccounted for.) 7 Resemblance with god N: cf. Robicsek 1981 nos. 3?13 (all have wrinkles; note the spidery limbs of no. 4), 14?16, 34, 37 and 38 / Benson 1979 figs. 1?5 (note the spidery limbs of fig. 4) / Coe 1975a no. 6 (clear wrinkles; note the insect-characteristic at the lower end of the spine and the cigar / torch in the hand). A god N without wrinkles is represented with insect-limbs on Robicsek 1978: pi. 138, where he is bearing the signs of the dead sun and moon. Since the nos. 3 and 10 in Robicsek 1981 have infixes resembling the in-sign in their foreheads (cf. also no. 6), they might be identical with the god N (note toad's ear) ruling over the nights of all tun- and katun-endings, viz. the 9th Lord of the Night.</page><page sequence="5">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 241 4. Water- and rain-deity. Turned towards the preceding figures and brandishing an axe is a deity with a zoomorphic face but a human body. His axe is curving back wards, which is the conventional way of depicting this weapon, as is clear from ceramic representations and, somewhat less distinctly, from the Dresden Codex.8 We may conclude that this god is a water- and rain-deity for the following reasons, (a) He has (or wears) a shell-ear (which classifies him with the anthropomorphic water god that occurs in the "god-I" position in certain Palencan clauses, see Schele 1976 b).9 (b) He occurs as a fishing god on Tikal bones (Trik 1963: figs. 6, 7). (c) An aquatic serpent can sprout from his head. On a bowl, he is shown as a tree-deity wading through water (Robicsek 1981: no. 120). The diverging branches of the tree growing from his skull terminate in the heads of the double-headed aquatic serpent as it occurs on lintel 3 of TikaPs temple IV (id., p. 96). (d) He brandishes an axe, both in the Dresden Codex (LII?LV) and in modern ethnography the attribute of the rain gods. The curving axe is a constant attribute of our deity ? again in combative pose ? in a series of similar ceramic representations reproduced in the catalogue of codical vase paintings (Robicsek 1981: nos. 19?31).10 In this series, the other hand holds a head with cauac-'mfixes. On the Dumbarton Oaks panel (Coe 1966: 16?17), an impersonator of the same deity brandishes a curving axe with the cauac-sign in fixed. As cauac means "lightning, rain storm", the axe is intended to represent the lightning-axe, which is the weapon of the rain gods in the ethnography of Yucatan (Redfield 1967: 116, 142). (e) He resembles in still other respects the rain gods in the Dresden Codex, whose almost constant attribute is the (lightning-)axe. They are closely associated with deer of identical form and posture as the one on the vase (XXX c) or else they sail in a canoe (passim) and grasp a fish (XLIVa), as the gods on the Tikal bones do.11 Of course, this comparison should be made with caution, as the codex shows both late and Yucatec peculiarities. 5. Dog. In front of the throne sits an anthropomorphic animal deity in a sub missive pose. The animal is of a darker colour than the puma, with a flatter face, dif ferent ear and teeth and with a sort of double chin. On top of the head small parallel lines, inclining to the right and topped by dots, are visible. Coe considers this to be a canine divinity. He takes the ear to be torn, although its form appears to be too 8 Axe: Coe 1973 nos. 42, 44/1978 no. 6/ Robicsek 1978: fig. 61, pi. 197-200, 257/D. C. passim. 9 By now, L. Schele has come to accept the identity of the aquatic "G-I" deity as a form of the rain god, Chac (Schele 1986: 49 and 49 n. 55) and would thus appear to have abandoned Lounsbury's previous suggestion that "G-I" was fulfilling the role of Hun Ah Pu (cf. Schele 1976a: 10?11). 10 The axes of the rain gods on the codical vases all have the T 616 b infix. This infix is sometimes diffi cult to distinguish from T 617, for which Schele and Miller have proposed the reading nen or lem, prima rily meaning "flash of lightning" (Schele 1983: 3 ff.). 111 might add the vase (Coe 1978: pi. 6) where what is probably the same zoomorphic "G-I" variant (safe for the ear) is accompanied by a frog armed with shield and spear ? the frog being the mythological companion of the rain god.</page><page sequence="6">242 H. E. M. Braakhuis regular for that.12 The general outline of the head is indeed that of a dog, as com parison with the dogs in the D. C. shows.13 Canines with the peculiarly shaped ear are present on other vases as well.14 The parallel lines terminating in dots can be found on the back of one of the codical dogs (XXI b) and on the head of another (XXIX a2). The straight parallel strokes with dots are identical with the death-god hairs set between eye-balls that constitute the T 12 affix, used to indicate the expira tion of a period (Thompson 1966: 161, 189).15 These hairs can alternate with crossed bars ("Saint Andrew's Cross") and then form the T 13 affix. This is precisely the kind of cross found on the wrists and ankles of the dog on the vase. The dog's head is separated from the body by a bar with an undulating line in it (best visible on pi. 164/165 in Robicsek 1978). In the calendarial diagram of the Madrid Codex (LXXV?LXXVI), this same element, with two little bells or "death eyes" at its lower extremes, adorns the fettered trunk of a decapitated person. Another canine figure (8th on vase no. 60, Coe 1982) wears just such a "death collar", complete with death-god hairs between the eye-balls. Adding to the general "expiration" symbolism, the dog's cheek is marked with a black dot, corresponding to the red dot on the cheek of the puma. The black dot probably is a death spot or stain of a corpse: the same feature can be seen on the bodies and faces of skeletal death gods and on the face of the hanged Ix Tab, goddess of suicides, in the Dresden Codex. 6. God D. On a throne in the form of glyph T 609 sits an aged god wearing a kind of diadem. This diadem sometimes contains an element resembling the akbal- or "darkness"-glyph and which, when surrounded by a dotted line, forms the prefix of the name-glyph of the aged god (cf. Princeton 6). The same holds good for the name glyph of god D in the Dresden Codex. The diadem also characterizes the so-called "Principal Bird Deity". According to Thompson, god D is identical with the upper god Itzamna (1970: 228?229). On independent grounds, Bardawil came to the same conclusion for the "Principal Bird Deity" (1976: 208). Similarly, the wig (a single one, as here, or a double one) is characteristic for god D. 7. White water bird. The tuft typical of the heron is lacking. The bird might be an albatros, cormorant, or pelican, although no webs are apparent. The peculiar dotted line on the neck is often found within aquatic elements, such as curls of water. 8. Tree of the patron of the XVIth month. The bird stands on the bulky head of a divinity from which two flower stalks spring. From the muzzle, which lacks a lower jaw, streams a red liquid, while above the ear a jaguar paw is visible. This is a mani 12 The ear may rather be a variant of T 2, probably "star" (Kelley 1976: 38). 13 Dog in D. C: VII a 2, XIII c 2, XXI b (with young moon/earth goddess), XXIX a 2, XXX/XXXI a, XLb2. 14 Examples of these dogs: Coe 1982 no. 60/Robicsek 1978 pi. 140/1981 nos. 36, 44, 46, 47, 48 a ("jaguar dogs"). 15 The "jaguar-dogs" mentioned in note 14 have a hair-like element on the head that should be disting uished from the death-hairs of T 12; it would appear to be identical with the T 116 affix.</page><page sequence="7">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 243 festation of the patron of the XVIth month, called Pax in Yucatec (as Robicsek has correctly seen, 1978: 148). On a well-known vase from Calcehtok (Kubler 1969: fig. 46), another bulky head (possibly of a Bacab) unmistakably serves as the trunk of a tree, while on its flowery stalks goddesses are seated. The most naturalistic represen tation of the patron of Pax as a tree occurs on a vase in codical style, with the Blow gunner aiming at a lizard-like animal in its (or his) branches (Robicsek 1981: no. 110). The head with the two flower stalks on the present vase probably should be seen in the same way. 9. Headband Vulture. The white water bird turns its beak towards an anthropo morphic bird-deity with a headband. The features of its head: the voluminous, bald, almost human skull, the distinctive beak, the clear T 59 (ti) affix, and the crop, leave no doubt that this is the bird generally identified as a vulture (cf. Kelley 1976: fig. 40; Schele 1983: 72; Thompson 1962: 330?334). As a rule, the vulture in the Dresden Codex, be it as a (non-calendarial) glyph or as a picture, has the same T 59 affix.16 This affix is also characteristic for the vulture when used as an indicator of calendar ial intervals (Thompson 1966: fig. 4 nos. 29, 30). Incidentally it occurs with the vul ture functioning as a day-sign (e. g. Robicsek 1978: 176). Because the vulture on the vase wears a headband, it can indeed be regarded as a free form of the vulture-variant of the XXth day-sign, T 747 a. The pose of the Headband Vulture is uncomfortable, neither lying nor sitting. The bird is not resting against the tree, from which it remains entirely separated. Comparison with other figures in a similar pose ? the arms lifted but without ten sion, one of the legs raised, and only the lower back and the buttocks touching the ground ? suggests that the vulture is shown in the act of falling, at the moment of hitting the ground (cf. the synoptic figure of "jaguar-infant" poses in Robicsek 1981: fig. 19).17 10. Headband God/Blowgunner. A young man whose hair falls in a long braid down his back sets a kind of stick with a red end at his mouth. The stick is supported from the underside in the way blowpipes (cf. Robicsek 1981: fig. 28 B, right upper corner) or cigars (id. 1978: passim) are held. The object's unusual length, the fact that it is clearly being directed, as shown by its inclination towards the vulture and by the use of both hands, one behind the other, and the fact that it does not emit smoke, together suggest that it may rather be intended as a blowgun. The body of the young man is covered with death stains. Around his forehead he wears a head 16 Vulture as a non-calendarial glyph: D. C.

In some cases, the upper element of the affix is different and, perhaps, changes it to T 146: D. C. VIII a 3 (glyph + picture), XIX a 3 (picture), XXIII b last column (glyph), XXXVIII b 1 (picture). 17 Other examples are: Bolz 1975 no.

E.M.Braakhuis band. The "jester diadem" fastened on the headband is an attribute of stele kings. This young man is Coe's Headband God. Together with the Headband Vulture, he occurs as a variant of the XXth day-sign. If this variant is full-figure, it can exhibit the same corpse stains as the young man on the vase (Thompson 1966: fig. 11 no. 36). There exists a correspondence between this alternative glyphic form of the day-sign and its alternative name (Hun) Ah Pu, "(One) Blowgunner", and at the same time between the connection of this day with the sun deity (Thompson 1966: 87?88) and the fact that the blowgun is the mythological attribute of the Sun Hero. From this double correspondence, one is led to conclude that the Headband God is the same as the Sun Hero. All the figures on the vase are kept clearly separate, with the exception of the first two. Their relation remains to be defined iconographically. It is improbable that the puma head is intended to constitute, together with the deer body, a true composite animal of the kind met elsewhere.18 The suggestion of unity conveyed by the conti nuous outline of the deer's belly and the back of the puma's neck is lessened by the visibility of the deer's right shoulder and by the curious position of its right fore-leg, crossing the left one. The sudden and twisted three-dimensional representation of this part of the deer's body provides a counter-suggestion, one of emergence rather than attachment of the puma's head and neck. Which is more important, the normal proportions of the puma's head strongly contrast with the abnormally swollen ones of the deer's body. In other words, the puma appears to be alive ? notwithstanding the stain on the cheeks ? while the deer is very dead indeed. Lastly, the blood on the shoulders suggests that the original deer-head has been severed. In summary, the first scene probably shows the head and neck of a puma as distinct from the carcass of a white-tailed deer. 4. Mythological identification On the basis of the visible interrelation of the figures and in accordance with Coe's description, three scenes can be distinguished. Which one is the first follows from the place of the initial sign of the Primary Standard Text (Coe 1973: 21). Essential to my explanation is the connection between the first and third scenes on the vase, depicting the beginning and the end of Sun's voyage to the City of the Vultures. This entails the assumption that the puma in the first scene is a form of the Blowgunner in the third scene. I shall attempt to justify this assumption presently. Scene 1. The myth states that Sun "borrows" the skin of the deer and hides under it; the vase has a puma hiding in the carcass of a white-tailed deer. The blood on the 18 Contra Robicsek 1978: 147. Examples of true composite animals: Robicsek 1978 pi. 108 (deer with dragon's head)/Coe 1982 no. 60 fig. 2 (deer with spider monkey's head). Elsewhere, elements of deer and spider monkey are combined in still different ways.</page><page sequence="9">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 245 deer's shoulder suggests that the puma has killed his favourite prey and bitten off its head ? an act shown on a vase-fragment in codical style (Robicsek 1981: no. 141). As the "borrowing of the skin" is a clear euphemism for killing a prey, it is only reasonable to assume that the role of the Sun-hunter has been taken over by one of the two hunting-animals par excellence, the puma (the other one being the jaguar). The position of the deer's right fore-leg seems to indicate an attitude of sub servience, which could be explained both by the deer's sacrificial role (implied in the notion of "borrowing") and by the function of the deer-carcass as a seat for the blowfly-gods. One of these insects is touching the head of the puma as if he is rubbing on it "the stuff that turns into worms": "Then he [Sun] called the blue blowfly and told him to put the stuff on the antelope skin that turns into worms" (Thompson 1930: 130).19 For an originator of decay, the "death-eyes" are a fitting attribute. As to the pose of the puma in the deer-carcass, if we compare it with that of the puma in the Dresden Codex (XLVII), speared by Lahun Chan, and with that of the deer, speared by the rain god (XXX c), we can see that it is the pose characteristic of a victim and is thus in accordance with Sun's mythological role of carrion to the vultures. The death stain on the puma's cheek serves to confirm this. The problems encountered when formally analyzing the unusual combination of puma-head and deer can now be understood. Apparently, the artist has sought to convey two contradictory impressions. On the one hand, the myth demanded that puma (Sun) and deer would look like one and the same animal, so as to mislead the vultures; but on the other hand, it also had to be made clear that the puma (Sun) did not really belong with the deer. Turned towards this group is the water- and rain-deity in a threatening attitude. This god can be identified as the brother of the Sun Hero in the Senahu version, called Choc, "Cloud", a water- and rain-deity. Choc's weeping for the loss of his mistress is taken by the Kekchis to be the origin of rain (Cruz 1965: 50). Of course, the name Choc is strongly reminiscent of the name of the Yucatec rain god, Chac (and some reasons for assuming at least a partial identity of the water- and rain-god on the vase with the rain gods in the Dresden Codex have already been given). The myth insists on the rivalry and conflict between sun god and rain god. Sun magically causes the rain god to chase away his mistress, but Choc obstinately tries to recover her. An open conflict arises and Sun has to defeat his brother before he is able to retrieve his wife. This conflict is alluded to in the first scene on the vase. 19 "Blue blowfly", yaskats; Cruz Torres speaks of "flies", rax chia (1961: 60). The rax chia originated from the ninth barrel into which the menstrual flow of the dead moon goddess had been collected by Sun: "Al abrirlo, todos los animalitos que salieron se untaron las patas de may [= tabaco; dolor], ahi se llevaron su mal" (Cruz 1961: 42).</page><page sequence="10">246 H.E.M.Braakhuis Scene 2. The dog is probably the Venus brother of the Sun Hero, Xulab. The most obvious reason for this identification is that the Kekchis themselves conceive of Venus (the Morning Star, like Xulab) as a dog, running ahead of the sun god (Thompson 1970: 250). According to Thompson, the sun god is likened to a hunter and the Morning Star to his hound. This would fit in with the animal hunter form of the Sun Hero in the first scene. The dog is generally associated with lasciviousness and adultery (Thompson 1966: 79), which characterizes the role of Xulab in the final episode of the myth. His abject pose is in accordance with his punishment by Sun in the San Antonio version, as are his attributes of "expiration". The scene as such, in front of the upper god, does not occur in any of the versions known to me; but since on funerary vases the most divergent figures present themselves to the upper god, the meeting of the two may not be essential to the development of the myth. Anyway, more important for the vase representation as a whole is the connection between scene 1 and scene 3. Scene 3. After retrieving his wife, Sun defeats the King of the Vultures. This is clearly shown on the vase. In the myth Sun makes the king fall asleep; on the vase he appears to shoot a blowgun. In a Zapotec version of the Sun Hero myth, Sun stupe fies his antagonist, his step-grandmother, with peppered smoke from a blowgun (Parsons 1936: 326); in the Kekchi myth, the malignant (grand)father of the moon goddess stupefies himself by inhaling pepper from a blowgun, put out of order by Sun (Thompson 1930: 127?128, cf. 1970: 359). A load of pepper and especially of peppered smoke would give a rationale for the red glow at the end of what is probably the blowgun. At the same time it would provide an explanation for the dif ficulty we had in distinguishing between blowgun and cigar.20 The royal dignity of the vulture can be seen from his headband. Iconographically, the headbands of both antagonists are similar to the "mitres" of the Aztec lords, in particular of their supreme lord. The so-called "jester diadem" occurs only with the Headband God on the vase, but in the XXth daysign, it is also found with the Head band Vulture (Schele 1983: fig. 16 e). It is typical of stele lords and of rulership in general (id.: 36?37). Its absence, here, on the headband of the King of the Vultures may be significant, as he is being defeated. The position of the scene with Blow gunner and Vulture King corresponds with the sequence of the incidents in the myth. The myth makes an undivided Sun Hero "borrow" the skin of the deer and defeat the Vulture King. The vase representation has these same acts performed by two distinct figures: the puma has killed the deer and the Blowgunner defeats the Vulture King. This replacement can be explained by the concept of the nahualli or animal companion. Just conceivably, one is dealing with a cigar shoved into a blowgun.</page><page sequence="11">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 247 At the very outset, the plausibility of a combination of divine hero and nahualli is suggested by the Aztec myth of QuetzalcoatPs descent into the Underworld, where the hero, in his struggle with the lord of the dead, is explicitly said to be accom* panied by his nahualli (Velazquez 1975: 120?121). However, the way the Maya appear to have worked out this notion, in this instance of the Sun Hero myth, remains to be traced. The puma is usually mentioned on a par with the jaguar, for example in the Popol Vuh.21 Being the two largest predatory cats, puma and jaguar together embody the idea of the hunt and, by extension, of avenging power and of war, as many examples attest. For the same reason, they are the nahuallis characteristic of the leaders of the Mayan community (Holland 1978: 103), be it at the level of the village or of the kingdom. In such a case, they incorporate the executive, avenging power of these men (id.: 102-105, 110-115). Under circumstances, a man can change into and assume the identity of his nahualli. Significantly, the Senahu version of the Sun Hero myth, at its very beginning, has the brothers practising their magical powers and specifically trans forming themselves into animals (nahualic) ? after which they go out hunting (Cruz 1965: 21). There are other cases in point. The participants in the Guatemalan war dance teleche dressed up as an eagle, an unidentified animal and especially as a jaguar and a puma in order to attack and sacrifice a captive, disguises which are explicitly stated to correspond to the participants' nahuallis (Resinos, apud Acuna 1975: 154). The Quiche ancestors assumed puma and jaguar shapes in their struggle against the Tribes (P. V. 6297?6298 ff.). The Quiche kings changed into wild beasts on their campaigns (Vasquez, apud Correa 1955: 57); their regalia included puma- and jaguar thrones and the bones (used as staffs) and claws of these two animals.22 Two Pokomchi headmen are stated to fight each other in their respective puma and jaguar transformations (Gage, apud Brinton 1894: 24). Sometimes, one finds the puma preponderant. In the Tzotzil village of Chamula it is said that the puma is the highest of all animal companions, ranking above the jaguar (Pozas 1977 II: 204) and, in another context, that he protects man against the jaguars (Gossen 1974: T 66, pp. 287?288). In connection with the bone-insignia of the Quiche lords, we have a statement by Friar Margil de Jesus confirming the pre ponderance of the puma: the lord invested with the bones of the puma is said to be 21 P. V. 267?268, 5955?5956, 6003?6004, 6015-6016. The Yucatec warriors wore the skins of jaguar and puma (Landa 1966: 52) and accordingly the Books of Chilam Balam speak of the "pulling out of the claws of jaguar and puma" as a sign of peace (Barrera 1972: 59). On a more mythological level, the wild Lacandons are believed by the Tzotziles to have the jaguar for a cat and the puma for a dog (Gossen 1974: T 63, p. 286); the dangerous dogs which the Kekchi old upper god Xucaneb sets at his adversary are the jaguar and the puma (Villacorta, apud Montoliu 1972: 343) and even the rain god Chac can call upon the jaguar and the puma to tear his enemy to pieces (Thompson 1930: 148). 22 Thrones: Titulo Coyoi, in Carmack 1973: 295; bones: Carmack 1979: 178; claws: P. V. 7301-7302. For further instances of kings being given the bones of jaguar and puma, cf. Garza 1984: 120.</page><page sequence="12">248 H. E. M. Braakhuis highest in rank, immediately followed by the leader in possession of the bones of the eagle; both are superior to the one bearing the bones of the jaguar, this last figure being "the lord for the mass of the Indians" (Saenz de Santa Maria 1981: 484). Since the jaguar was a symbol of the earth and the underworld, this last remark would imply that the eagle- and especially the puma-leader headed the aristocratic warriors and were associated with the heavenly region.23 All this is to show that the transformation of the Sun Hero into a puma is nothing exceptional, but follows traditional Mayan notions about the relationship of power ful individuals and their animal companions. The mythological role of the Sun Hero involves him in hunting ? the killing of the deer ? and in war ? a series of con flicts, with his brothers and with the Vulture King and his helpers ?, and thus creates just the sort of situations which invite a nahualli transformation.24 5. The ritual context 5.1 The war-feast of the month of Pax A combination of Sun Hero and Pax-deity recurs on several vases.25 The presence of the patron of the XVIth month appears to be crucial, therefore, to the interpreta tion on the mythologically identified vase scenes. This numen has the form of a kind of tree with a bird perched on it. Such a combination of tree and bird served as a marker of time periods: each of the 20 days had its specific tree and bird (Roys 1965: XII) and possibly each katun also (or period of 20 years of 360 days), to judge from the fact that trees with birds were erected on the first day of the cycle of 13 katuns, and considering the distinct bird species found with each of the (originally) 13 katuns in the Paris Codex. By analogy, we have here the calendar-tree of the month of Pax, marking the birth of that month or of its divine patron. Apparently, the function of the bird together with the tree is to fix the mythological events in time. In the month of Pax the last general feast of the year was held. The rituals of this month were entirely devoted to war. The actual feast, called Pacum Chac, "was 23 B. Cartwright Brundage mentions several sources indicating the existence, among the Aztecs, of a third order of puma-knights, besides those of the eagle and the jaguar (1979: 200 n. 10). In the Leyenda de los Soles, the jaguar and the eagle attempt to recover the solar hero, Nanahuatl, from the fire, but only the eagle succeeds (Velazquez 1975: 122, cf. Brundage 1979: 197). The jaguar is said to have acquired his spots in the process, which could imply that before his unsuccessful immolation, the so-called jaguar was actually a puma (as R. A. M. van Zantwijk has kindly pointed out to me). 24 This conclusion would imply that (Hun) Ah Pu relates to Xbalanque (probably to be identified with god Nine, a deity with jaguar-characteristics, cf. Schele 1986: 51) as puma to jaguar. For Xbalanque as a god of war and human sacrifice, cf. Fuentes y Guzman (1969 I: 76?77 = L. I C. VI) and Casas (1967 I: 650 = L. Ill C. CXXIV). 25 Pax ? Blowgunner/Headband God: Robicsek 1981 nos. 109, 110 and fig. 28 B, right upper corner/ 1978 pi. 171?174. The hypothesis that in all these cases Blowgunner and Headband God equate with the Sun Hero appears plausible, even though not all of the features of the Sun Hero ? headband, braided hair, stains ? are present in each and every case. Similarly, the Sun Hero as a day-glyph may occasionally lack some of his distinctive traits (cf. Thompson 1966: fig. 11 nos. 33, 35, 36).</page><page sequence="13">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 249 destined for matters of war and to gain victory over the enemies" (Landa 1966: 83). It was preceded by a vigil of five days in the temple of the god Cit Chac Coh, "Father Great Puma". During this vigil, the war leader of the community or nacom was transported to the temple. On the way, he was honoured with incense "as if he were a temple idol" and this was continued in the temple itself. In this same prepara tory period war dances were held, called holkan okot, "dances of the holkan-wzrriors". The actual feast consisted of the "ceremonies and sacrifices of the fire", the exorciz ing of "the devil", general prayer and sacrifice by the people, a ritual circuit of the nacom or war leader on the shoulders of the lords around the temple, the sacrifice of a dog and the breaking of jars full of drink. Then the nacom was brought home, but this time without incense. From this description by the Bishop of Yucatan ? rough and superficial as it may be ?, it becomes understandable why the deity patronizing this month lacks his lower jaw, since it was customary to take away the mandible of the enemy slain on the battlefield (Landa 1966: 52). This ritual act symbolic of a violent death has been made visible in the deity's physiognomy. The form in which the red liquid, pro bably blood, streams from its mouth, is reminiscent of the knife set in the mouth of the god personifying the blood sacrifice (see Joralemon 1974: fig. 24). Since war and human sacrifice form an unbreakable unity, it is similarly significant that the patron of this month is repeatedly found in an intimate association with human sacrifice, once indeed eating the entrails of a human victim (Robicsek 1982: no. 6).26 The theme of sacrifice appears to be reflected in each of the three scenes on the vase. In this connection one may notice that the name of the feast of Pax, Pacum Chac, apparently does not refer to the puma war god, as would be expected, but to the rain god Chac; and that, at the end of the feast, a dog was sacrificed. The rain-god27 and dog on the vase ? the last one with "death-collar" and a corpse-stain on the cheek ? might therefore relate to elements of the feast.28 However this may be, an unequivocal reference to the central figure of the feast is constituted by the puma in the first vase scene, which can be identified as the puma war god Cit Chac Coh. The very similar puma in the Dresden Codex provides another instance of this war god. In the astronomical tables for calculating the revolutions of Venus in this codex, manifestations of the planet spear various gods that are symbols for social groups. One of the gods thus killed is a puma (XLVII), in 26 Pax-deity associated with a severed, blooding head: Robicsek 1981 no. 36. Id. assisting in the capture of a young deity emerging from an aquatic serpent: Coe 1978 no. 12. God resembling the Pax-deity, gnawing at another god's leg: Coe 1975a no. 6. 27 It may be relevant here that warriors are repeatedly provided with the attributes of the theriomorphic variant of "G-I": Robicsek 1981 nos. 95, 98; Bonampak Temple of the Murals room 2, east wall, upper left corner; Bonampak lintel 3, Balancan-Morales stele 4, Yaxchilan stele 11 (in these last cases, the warriors are kings subdueing their enemies). Of course, the lightning-axe in itself betrays the god's warlike potential. 28 For the rain god this is especially true if the tupp kak ritual referred to by Landa would indeed have constituted an element inherent in the Pacum Chac feast ? a possibility which cannot be entirely exclud ed, notwithstanding Long and Thompson (1966: 100).</page><page sequence="14">250 H. E. M. Braakhuis a pose to which the puma-deer on the vase has been completely assimilated.29 By ana logy with the corresponding representations in Mexican codices, the puma god in the Mayan codex indicates the social group of the warriors (Thompson 1972: 64). In deed, Landa states elsewhere that the Yucatec warriors wore not only the skins of the jaguar, but also those of the puma (1966:52). Out of this group of warriors, the one primarily intended is the war leader or nacom, who has been replaced by his god. This is directly illustrated on a vase where the nacom himself, in his human form, is leading two other warriors (Coe 1975a: pi. 16). He is recognizable by an unmistakable puma headdress, slightly inclined as in the codex and on the Princeton vase. This nacom -war leader is again preceded by the nacom-sacrificer, wearing a vulture headdress. Both are assisting in a human sacrifice. The transformation of the Sun Hero into his puma-nahualli thus appears to be determined not only by his divine authority and the militant aspects of his mytholo gical role, but also by the dramatization of his myth on the feast of the puma war god. By being placed in such a ritual context, the Sun Hero temporarily assumes the role of the war leader celebrated at the feast. His mythical exploits then come to symbolize the prevalent themes of war and human sacrifice.30 5.2 The Zabacil Than or agony of the solar year The feast of Pacum Chac is the last monthly feast which Landa deems worthy of description, albeit cursorily. It was the last general feast, centering on the capital and visited by the populace of the lesser towns. The celebrations remaining until the first month of Pop were dispersed over the various towns. Landa has only contemptuous remarks to make about them. These "centrifugal" feasts together were called Zabacil Than or "Law of the Zabac-powder". The zabac-powdtr was a black dye, prepared from the smoke of the zabac-tree (Cordemex Vocabulary, under sabak). Zabac can indicate mourning31 and also the re lated idea of fasting, as is shown by the following. In the first month of Pop, when the Zabacil Than was over, those who had fasted removed the black dye (tizne negro) which they had worn for the previous 2?3 months (Landa 1966: 89, cf. Roys, apud Tozzer 1941: p. 165, N 872). Clearly, the months of the Zabacil Than encompassed 29 The puma is struck by Venus on Venus' own day, Lamat, eight days after the day of the sun deity, Ahau/(Hun) Ah Pu. It is interesting that this particular day Ahau falls on the 18th of Pax, since this might indicate that the succession of these two days (Ahau and Lamat), delimiting Venus' stay in the under world, was correlated with a reversal in the same Sun-Venus antagonism which is alluded to in the second vase-scene. 30 Cf. note 24. 31 Sabak nok\ ropa de luto (Cordemex Voc). Of course, the colour black in itself often symbolizes death.</page><page sequence="15">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 251 the marginal period of the solar year.32 The period of fasting, or perhaps mourning, found its climax in the "black" Uayeb-days, after which the rites of the turning of the year introduced the first month of the new solar cycle. In this first month, the New Fire was lit, symbolizing the year's renewal. In the books of the Yucatec chilam balam's one finds the expression "death throes" or expiration of the year (cf. Thompson 1966: 189). By analogy, the Zabacil Than can be understood as the extended agony of the solar year. Seen in this light, the presence of the patron of Pax, being a deity associated with sacrifice, and of the blowflies, the death stains on the body of the Blowgunner, the victim pose of the puma nahualli and Sun's mythological role as carrion to the vultures, all acquire the calendarial meaning: agony of the solar year and of its personification, the Sun Hero. This inference is strengthened by the fact that the same two mythical antagonists, Headband God (Blowgunner) and Headband Vulture, function as the hieroglyphic variants for (a) the last day of the katun and other vigesimal units, whose name is used to designate the whole preceding period (coefficient plus Ahau or Ah Pu, "Blowgunner"), and (b) the "Ahau-katun" used to measure the phases of a king's life or reign (cf. Closs 1982: 47?50, Kelley 1976: 231, Schele 1983: 73). In these cases it is evident that both antagonists can only symbolize calendarial completion. For the solar year (360 + 5 days) as well as for the katun (20 x 360 days), the same mythological reasoning applies. The struggle between both Ahau's, in which at first the Vulture Lord, then the Sun Lord gets the upper hand, is both agony and struggle for renewal of the period. The Sun Hero in his death throes (note the almost never failing corpse-stain), picked up by the vulture as a piece of carrion, symbolizes the completion or death of the period. But so does the Vulture Lord, the recipient of all that is expired. In an antagonistic dualism, the Sun Lord is presented as the threatened life of the period, the Vulture Lord as the threatening death of the period. Essential is that the myth guarantees the progression of time, since in it, the result of disrup tive conflict and apparent death is their very contrary, life. The defeat of the Vulture King by the Sun Hero logically concludes the marginal period of the solar year. The final moment of the myth, which is not represented on the vase, viz. the ascent of Sun, accompanied by Moon and Venus, in the midst of a great fire, then stands for the start of a new period. Herein lies the fundamental agreement between the Kekchi "Legend" and the Mexican "Leyenda". In the Leyenda de los Soles, the ascent of the hero (covered with sores instead of corpse stains) from a great fire likewise signifies both a new Sun and a new era, this era simply being called "Sun" and expressed as a multiple of solar years. The renewal of the Sun Hero in a big bonfire ? lit by the helpers of the Vulture King in a variant from San Antonio! ? prefigures, in a sense, the lighting of the New Fire in Pop. 32 If one were to connect the Zabacil Than with the Lacandon name, and concept, of the rain deity, Men Sabak, another train of reasoning might start which would extend the antagonistic role of the water and rain-deity from the month of Pax into the marginal period.</page><page sequence="16">252 H. E. M. Braakhuis The third vase scene thus constitutes a kind of full-figure glyph ? analogous to the antagonistic examples from Quirigua ?, either for the completed solar year (includ ing the Pax tree), or for the completed katun (excluding the same). 5.3 Periodic renewal of the reign In reasoning further, it is no longer possible to rely on data from Landa's all-too short description of the Pacum Chac feast and the Zabacil Than. Instead, we should take a closer look at the iconographic and hieroglyphic associations of the two anta gonists from the third vase scene. Both mythological figures are head-variants of the XXth day, generally called Ahau, "Lord" or "King". As such, they are provided with attributes of kingship, viz. headband and "jester diadem". In today's mantic practice, Hun Ah Pu, corresponding to Yucatec Ahau, is the day of the house and of the ancestors.33 In view of the alternative name Ahau, originally the aristocratic house and the aristocratic ancestors were meant in the first place. The day Ahau/(Hun) Ah Pu is the day which completes the larger periods of the Long Count, i. p. the katuns. In the Books of Chilam Balam, the succession of the katuns is presented as a succession of kings and reigns. According to Avendano y Loyola, the thirteen katuns divided the country of Yucatan into thirteen parts (apud Roys 1967: 184); and in the Paris Codex, each of the (originally) thirteen katuns is illustrated with a king on his throne. This imagery becomes even more explicit in the context of Classic Period dynastic chronology, where the time-unit of the "Ahau-katun" is often found personified as a Sun Lord-katun or a Vulture Lord-katun. Similarly, when the beginning of a human reign or of its katun-jubilees are mentioned in the inscriptions, the abstract hierogly phic combination for reign, ahaulel (or conceivably ahpolel), often gives way to a combination including the personified Sun Lord or Vulture Lord variants for ahau (or ahpo) (Closs 1982: 47, 50; Schele 1983: 73, figs. 24, 25).34 In short, each time the completion of the reign or a phase thereof is stated ? be it a strictly calendarial or a dynastic reign ? and a new reign is about to begin, the ab stract Lord-glyphs are apt to be replaced by one of the two main antagonists of the Sun Hero myth. This makes the last scene but one of this myth, as depicted on the Princeton vase, not only a special kind of full-figure glyph, but at the same time an emblem for the renewal of the reign. This conclusion accords with the role the Sun Hero myth has to fulfil within the context of the Leyenda de los Soles and the Popol Vuh. Both are essentially dynastic chronologies, for which the Sun Hero myth provides the mythological base. Here, too, the Sun Hero prefigures the king. If one remembers that, among the Quiche, 33 See the following section and note 35. 341 leave out of account here the suggestive variant for "inauguration" consisting of a vulture-head in a knotted sacrificial band.</page><page sequence="17">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 253 the warring king was thought to transform himself into a wild beast, jaguar or puma, it will be clear that the first and the last figure on the vase are but the two sides of the same royal coin. 6. The funerary perspective Inherent in the last episode of the Kekchi Sun Hero myth is a funerary perspective. It has been argued that during the Classic Period this episode served to dramatize the agony of the solar reign. The third vase scene was interpreted as a kind of full-figure glyph for the completion of solar year, katun and "Ahau-katun". As the Vulture Lord and the Sun Lord both represent the day Ahau, "Lord", the funerary significance of the vase representation may also be discussed by concentrat ing on the mantic values of this day, the day on which all vigesimal periods "expired". Ahau is called (Hun) Ah Pu in the surviving mantic practice of the Guate malan Highlands. The day lord Hun Ah Pu is described by Ximenez as "the one that descended into the Underworld" (1965: C. XXXVI, p. 120). It, or perhaps bet ter he, has two main connotations.35 On the one hand, it is the day of the (at one time probably aristocratic) house and the household. The household is founded on the dead, not only in a figurative sense, but also quite litterally: formerly the dead were buried beneath the floor of their own house. On the other hand, therefore, "Blowgunner" is the day of the ancestors and the dead. On a Blowgunner day, one prays that the souls of the dead may enter the Underworld (Tedlock 1982: 124). In the Popol Vuh, the Blowgunner himself descends into Xibalba; in the Senahu ver sion, the City of the Vultures is called (Xi)balba. The mantic connotations of the day lord Blowgunner give the shortest summary possible of the Sun Hero myth. Sun is the prototype of every living male (Gossen 1974: 40; Neuenswander 1981: 120?130), but in particular of the halach uinic, the "real man" or king. In the Kekchi myth, he founds a household and undergoes the tensions typical of the Mayan household. As a consequence of the household's dis ruption, he "dies" and so becomes the prototype of the dead. At this point, the myth is taken up by the vase representation. In his struggle, the Sun Hero assumes the shape of his puma nahualli ? consecrated to death as indicated by the stain on the cheek ? and hides in the deer-carcass covered with flies. In this way he comes to ful fil the role of a victim: his puma head replaces the head of the deer and his body takes the place of the deer's bowels. This image of agony nonetheless contains the message: Sun's death is only apparent; it is merely a ruse so as to mislead the vultures. The defeat of the personification of decay and death, the Vulture Lord, brings the tragi comedy to an end: the Sun Hero, still covered with the stains of a corpse, purifies himself in a fire and ascends to his heavenly reign. 35 Cf.: Bunzel 1959: 280, Colby 1981: 224, LaFarge 1947: 176, Narciso 1976: 82, Schultze Jena 1933: 32, Tedlock 1982: 124-125, Wagley 1949: 70.</page><page sequence="18">254 H.E.M.Braakhuis</page><page sequence="19">A Classical Mayan Funerary Theme 255 CO &gt; ? ? 8 21% t5 w .&lt;2 ? c w ? .2 g (D .z ?"DC 5 C U 3 CO CO CM O LU z LU O - CO CO 8 o f s O CO &lt;D 2 - g I E 1 E LU c ?
