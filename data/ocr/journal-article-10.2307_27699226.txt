<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TODI FRESCO AND ST PATRICK'S PURGATORY, LOUGH DERG by Noel Mac Tr?infhir In the autumn of 1984 Monsignor Alfonso Tejada, a Spaniard living in Todi, came to the Irish College, Rome, in search of literature on Lough Derg for Don Mario Pericoli, pastor of S. Maria in Camuccia, Todi. He explained that a fresco depicting St Patrick and his purgatory had been discovered in the choir chapel of a convent there and that Don Mario was doing some research on St Patrick and Lough Derg. I first visited the convent of San Francesco to see the fresco on 1 February 1985. Todi, where this fresco is to be seen in the choir chapel of the Clarissan convent in the Via del Borgo Nuovo, is a city in the Italian region of Umbr?a. It is the birthplace of Jacopone da Todi (1230-1307), Franciscan monk and reputed author of the Stabat Mater. Situated twenty-five miles south of Perugia and perched some 411 metres above sea-level in the middle of an otherwise amphitheatre-like plain with the Tiber to the west and the ancient Via Flaminia to the east, the ruins of its Etruscan, Roman and medieval walls bear quiet testimony to the confluence of peoples which engendered the res tudertina. The medieval aspect of the city is particularly striking. The fourteenth century Romanesque-Gothic cathedral with its delicately executed portal and rose windows stands high above the northern end of the Piazza del Pop?lo. The piazza, which rests upon the vaults of a roman cistern, is sided with massive medieval palaces. Todi was strong and powerful both economically and politically during the Middle Ages. She enjoyed a lively civic administration during the thirteenth and the greater part of the fourteenth centuries.1 Her influence and prosperity began to wane during the fifteenth century. Notwithstanding her share of the internal conflicts which so disrupted Italian cities in the later Middle Ages,2 the basilica of Santa Maria della Consolazione, sometimes erroneously referred to as Bramante's dry run for St Peter's in Rome, stands as a magnificent accomplishment in the life of sixteenth century Todi. In the mid-fourteenth century the present convent of San Francesco was a Servite monastery. It was then known as San Marco and had been occupied by the Serv?tes from the year 1280, if not beforehand.3 St Philip Benizi,4 Father General of the 1 C. Martini, Todi e Perugia.

Benizi was born in Florence in 1233. Having studied medicine, he entered the Serv?tes as a lay brother in 1254. He remained a brother until 1258/9 when he was ordained. It is a popular tradition that he was proposed for the Papacy at the famous conclave of Viterbo (1268-71). He died in San Marco, Todi in 1285. He was canonised by Pope Clement X in 1671. 141</page><page sequence="2">Clogher Record Servites from 1267 until 1285, who is depicted in the fresco between St Peter and the Madonna, died here on 22 August 1285. He had just returned from an audience with the newly elected Pope Honorius IV. In this audience he had restated the case for the exemption of the Servites from the directives of the second Council of Lyons (1274) for the suppression, or gradual extinction, of those mendicant orders which had come into existence, approval notwithstanding, since the Lateran Council in 1215. Benizi was buried here in San Marco, and presumably because of the cult which developed in Todi soon after his death, his remains were twice transferred within the monastery. In June 1317 they were exhumed and placed in the wall of the chapel where the fresco would be painted just twenty-nine years later. In August 1579 they were placed under its main altar.5 On their departure from San Marco in 1599 the Servites took the remains with them to their new abode at Santa Maria delle Grazie. Shortly afterwards the fresco, except for the area showing the head and shoulders of Philip Benizi, was covered with whitewash. Thus it was consigned to oblivion for more than three and a half centuries, until 1974, when Marcello Castrachini and his wife, Leonilde, commenced work on its recovery. The recovery of this fresco is of immense significance for the history of iconography of purgatory. Writing on this topic in the highly esteemed Lexicon der christlichen Ikonographie, W. Braunfels has asserted that purgatory does not feature in figurative art until the end of the fourteenth century.6 This fresco may therefore rank among the earliest depictions - and it may well be the first on this scale7 - of purgatory as a place or state separate from paradise and hell.8 The present Mother Superior of the convent, Sr. Maria Angela Urbani and her predecessor in office, Sr. Pia Serafini, neither of whom will abandon the visitor to an uninformed contemplation of the fresco, entered San Francesco in the early years of the 1930s. They remember the layout of the chapel as it was at the time. The fresco wall was covered with a wainscoting to a height of ten feet approximately. An opening in the wooden panel revealed the bust of St Philip Benizi. On the upper regions of the wall vague patches of colour were visible where the layers of whitewash had flaked away. The abbess' throne was located at the centre of the fresco wall and set into the wooden panel. Above the simple throne a painting of the 5 A.M. Serra, 'P. Benizi', in: Bibliotheca Sanctorum, v. col. 737-756. 6 E. Kirchbaum, (ed), article 'Fegfeuer' in Lexicon der christlichen Ikonographie, 1970, vol. 2, col. 17. On this topic see also L. R?au, 'Escatologia,' in Enciclopedia Cattolica, x, col. 339. 7 The dimensions of the fresco are 3.50 X 7.50 metres. 8 Its significance in this particular regard should not be underestimated. As L. R?au points out (art. cit.) purgatory features but rarely in twelfth and thirteenth century iconography. When it does, it is treated analogously to hell and never attains a conceptual autonomy. It had still to be freed from what J. Le Goff describes as its "infernalisation" in his work, La Naissance du Purgatoire, Editions Gallimard, Paris, 1981, p. 281. This iconographical state of affairs is perfectly comprehensible from a theological perspective. With the publication of Dante Alighieri's La Divina Commedia and the declaration of the Council of Florence on purgatory (1439) purgatory assumed its autonomy. For the development of its iconography in later centuries, see Ph. M. Halm, Tkonographische Studien zum Armen-Seelen-Kultus,' M?nchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst, xii, 1922, and also M. Aggh?zy, Tes Repr?sentations du Purgatoire au XVIII Si?cle,' in Bulletin du Mus?e Hongrois des Beaux-Arts, x, 1957, 99-103. 142</page><page sequence="3">The Todi Fresco Madonna and Child among angels, by an unknown artist and dated 1602, was suspended from the vaulted ceiling. The Sisters recall that, when removing the throne for cleaning purposes, it was possible to distinguish traces of raised hands of the anima (soul) emerging from the purgatorial mountain. Oral tradition among the Servites in Todi carried word of the erstwhile existence of a magnificent figure of the Madonna on a wall of this chapel.9 On the basis of this tradition, one presumes, G-M. Bessuti, in an article written in 1967, referred to a wall in the chapel which was once completely frescoed. He called for its restoration.10 Fr. Mario Pericoli was also active in promoting the case for its restoration. The process of recovery and cleaning the fresco was long and tedious: begun in 1974, it was completed in 1976.n Upon removing the wainscot, M. Castrachini saw the following: the Benizi bust with the olive branch, the traces of the two animae emerging from purgatory and aloft two areas of indecipherable colouring. He also noted that the Benizi bust had received several coats of varnish during the course of the centuries. This had darkened the colours to a point where one would never have thought of the bust as part of a fresco with its more transparent colours. The choir stalls were then removed to reveal that the lower level of the wall had not been frescoed. However two interesting discoveries were made: the floor level of the chapel had been raised by a metre, thus altering the original viewing angle of the fresco and it was further established that a door had been opened in the left corner in the early seventeenth century, causing the loss of a section of plaster vitally important for the dating of the work. When the whitewash had been removed, an examination of the damaged areas revealed that the wall was of bricks and the traditional (lime and sand) mortar. While the fresco had been spared the ravages of down-rain and damp, other forms of damage had occurred. As well as the damage already referred to in the lower left corner, fire damage destroyed the lower right cavern, where the punishment of the gluttonous is depicted, so that one can now see only the sinopia outline of the faces of the animae. Castrachini is of the opinion that the lacunae at the top right of the city walls and on the face and trunk of the angel above the Madonna's head are the result of the erection of a scaffolding. The preliminary investigations also revealed graffiti on the surface of the fresco: fourteenth and fifteenth century dates, a walled castle with a road leading to the cavern subtitled accidia (sloth), the heads of friars wearing berets, and in the area below the caption hec est civitas aeterna (lower left corner), two faces traced in charcoal pencil, one of which is a powerfully expressive face of an old woman. Evidently the salutary scenario of the fresco ceased to evoke intimations of the dies irae alone! One can imagine the amount of work involved in the removal of the layers of whitewash - with scalpel and the aid of a magnifying glass. The task was particularly difficult and intricate in the areas where the membrane was almost detatched from the 9 M. Castrachini, 'Recupero e Restauro', in: Dal Purgatorio di S. Patrizio alla Citt?

Work on the recovery of the arched bordering was also demanding because of the tempera used in its decoration. The amount of actual restoration was minimal and a conservative technique was used. The colouring of filled abrasions was done with watercolours, whereas tempera was used to colour the repaired lacunae. Given the satisfactory state of the fresco's preservation, a light solution was sufficient for the final cleaning which was superficial only. Castrachini reports that there are fifteen giornate12 in the fresco, excluding the area beyond the arched bordering. The main figures consist of two gionate each. He also mentions that the sinopia was drawn with great care in terra rossa colouring. Establishing the date of the work demanded a certain ingenuity. While the numerals M CCC X are clearly visible in the left corner, the final numerals of the date are missing. Although documents and records which might have helped in dating the work were lost from the monastery's archives and library during the napoleonic era and during the nineteenth century, D-M. Montagna, a Servite historian, was able to piece together various references which led him to settle for 1346 as the year of its execution.13 He recalled the existence of a reference to the image of Blessed Philip Benizi in fra Arcangelo Giani's Annales which, though entered under the year 1347, is itself elucidated by a footnote dating the Benizi image to 1346. He found further evidence for 1346 in a testimony given by Luc' Alberto Petti (1536-1640), chancellor and notary, at a local hearing for the canonisation of P. Benizi in December 1620.15 While the Sienese provenance of the work is agreed by those who have proffered 12 A giornata refers to the section of a fresco painted in one day. Clearly much work had to be done before this stage was reached. When the wall was prepared, a penultimate layer of plaster (the arriccio) was applied. The outline of the pictorial subject, or sinopia, (a modern term derived from the name of the town Sinope, on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, where the red earth pigment, terra rossa, often used to draw the sinopia - as in this fresco - is found) was then drawn on the arriccio. Finally the area for the day's painting was plastered. This layer of plaster, usually 1cm. or less in thickness, is called the intonaco. While wet the plaster is transparent; thus the sinopia outline was still visible. The paint was then applied to the fresh plaster. As the plaster dried, the carbonisation of the lime, by action of the carbonic acid gas in the air, bound the pigments into a solid crystalline mass. 13 D-M.

This represents the present theory on the dating of the fresco. It should be noted that Montagna's sources are of the seventeenth century. Further evidence might necessitate a re-evaluation of his thesis. I understand that his theory has been questioned in recent months. 144</page><page sequence="5">The Todi Fresco opinions regarding the artist's identity, various artists were suggested as the author. The attribution of the fresco to Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio was first made by Federico Zeri16 whose opinion could only be dismissed after detailed consideration of serious counter-evidence. The findings of a study of the punch marks in the haloes would possibly prove to be of value in this regard,17 but I am not aware that such a study has been conducted on this fresco. Little is known of Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio. Born in Siena between 1315 and 1320, he died around 1396. Architect as well as painter, he is reputed to have worked on the construction of the cathedral in Siena and its baptistery.18 His father, Mino Parcis, was also a painter and collaborator of Pietro Lorenzetti. In an interesting article M. Frinta has reported the results of a study on the similarities between the Pietro Lorenzetti, Mino Parcis and Jacopo punch-marks.19 Jacopo's works20 reveal a competence in perspective and an interest in creating an illusion of space within his group compositions.21 L. Bellosi claims that he was the father of a generation of Sienese painters.22 If relatively little is known about Jacopo, the commissioning of the work itself is shrouded in the mists of history. It was executed while Matteo da Citt? della Pieve was General of the Servites (1344-48). It is therefore possible that he commissioned it. Mario Pericoli favours the opinion that Matteo's predecessor, Pietro da Todi, Servite General from 1314 until 1344, who took a personal interest in the promotion of Benizi's cult, commissioned the work.23 The subject may have been suggested by the tradition that just before dying, Philip Benizi uttered the words: "I have just engaged in a terrible battle with our eternal enemy ... who made accusations against me so that I might be lost forever in hell's fire. But Christ the Lord and the blessed Virgin snatched me from him and they showed me my incorruptible and indescribably beautiful crown 16 C.

Casalini sees its presentation of the purgatorial theme in the context of the development in Marian devotion which took place in central Italy in the fourteenth century. He even suggests that the sabbatine privilege25 may have been the inspiration of its theme. Whatever the particular reasons for the choice of subject, from the twelfth century onwards purgatory acquired an autonomy as a separate region in the popular conception of the geography of the afterlife.26 The popular piety of the late Middle Ages, with its predilection for the fabulous and the awe-inspiring, was most receptive to the presentation of themes of the afterlife. Judgement had been a favourite theme for church portals in the twelfth century and it was a very common iconographie theme of the thirteenth century. From the Carolingian period and earlier the tradition of legends and visions relating journeys into the afterlife had never failed to catch the medieval imagination. A rich source for the thought and belief of the Middle Ages, they are among Dante's sources of inspiration for his La Divina Commedia which appeared at the beginning of the fourteenth century.27 Significant developments were made in the theology of purgatory in the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The works of such authors as, Peter Lombard, St Bonaventure who mentioned St Patrick's Purgatory in his Commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences,28 and of St Thomas Aquinas provided the foundations for a clear doctrinal statement on purgatory. The first such statement was produced at the Council of Florence in 1274. I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that P. Benizi gave particular attention to the theme of purgatory in his preaching. However the mendicants certainly emphasised the imminence of death and the need for penance in preparation for entry 24 G.-M. Bessuti, 'La "Legenda" perugina di san Filippo da Firenze' in: Studi Storici O.S.M. 17, 1967, pp 90-115. The text: "... ego fui modo in magno certamine cum hoste antiquo humani generis de multis me accusante ut me posset dampnare secum in gehenam ignis eterni. Et eripuit me Dominus noster Jesus Christus ab eo et beatissima virgo Maria. Et ostenderunt mihi in celo incoruptibilem et ineffabilem coronam glorie mee" (see p. 111). 25 E. Casalini, 'La Madonna d?lie Anime' in: Riparazione Mariana, 63, vi, 1978 pp 25-28. The sabbatine privilege had its origin in a pseudo Bull of Pope John XXII, Sacratissimo uti culmine (1322) said to be based on a vision he had of the Blessed Virgin in which privileges were granted to the Carmelites and their confraternities. On the observation of prescribed conditions the Blessed Virgin promised to liberate souls from purgatory on the Saturday after their death and lead them into paradise. Casalini does not seem to give any serious consideration to the dating of the Bull and the controversies which have surrounded it. 26 J. Le Goff, La Naissance du Purgatoire, Gallimard, Paris 1981, pp 259-284. (An English translation of this book was published by Scolar Press, London, 1984). C. Carozzi's article, 'La G?ographie de L'Au-Del? et sa Signification pendant Le Haut Moyen Age,' in: XXIX Settimana di Storia del Centro Italiana di Studi sull'alto Medievo, Spoleto, 1981, pp 423-485, provides an interesting counterbalance to Le Goff s nominalist argumentation. J. Le Goff attended this 1981 conference. It is interesting that the Italian translation of his book (Einaudi, 1982), unlike the later English translation, contains a reproduction of the Todi fresco. 27 For a study of the possible influence of visions of Irish origin on Dante see G.S.

In 1340 an outbreak of bubonic plague resulted in the death of 15,000 Florentines. Both Florence and Siena suffered bankruptcies throughout the decade and there was a widespread failure of crops in 1346.30 A fresco such as this was a sermon in paint. The mendicants, strong adherents of the opinion that the image was the scripture of the unlettered,31 were outstanding in commissioning frescoes both for edification and instruction. The inclusion of St Patrick in this depiction of purgatory is yet another testimony to the widespread knowledge of St Patrick's Purgatory in the Europe of the mid-fourteenth century. Clearly the observer was expected to understand St Patrick's association with purgatory, or else others were presumed to be able to explain the association. The presumption was not unwarranted. Numerous medieval manuscripts include references to St Patrick's purgatory or Lough Derg. Whether the De Purgatorio Patritii of David Scottus, bishop of Bangor (Wales) from 1120 until 1139 ever existed or not,32 H. of Saltrey's Tractatus de Purgatorio sancti Patricii, written in the late twelfth century, launched a European knowledge of Lough Derg.33 An account of the experiences of the knight Owen in the cave on Station island, it has been described as a bestseller of the Middle Ages by Shane Leslie.34 It was reproduced in several manuscripts.35 The elusive poetess, Marie de France, gave a particular impetus to the spread of Owen's account of his experiences in her widely disseminated and much read UEspurgatoire de Seint Patriz (c. 1190). Just a few decades later the Cistercian, Caesarius of Heisterbach, writing his Dialogus miraculorum (1223), had little doubt as to the significance of Lough Derg: qui de purgatorio dubitat, Scotiam per gat, Purgatorium Sancti Patricii intret, et de purgatorii poenis amplius non dubitabit.36 Jacobus de Varagine also treats of it in his Legenda ?urea which had become immensely popular, especially in Italy, by the mid-fourteenth century. And it even featured in Guerrino il Meschino, an Italian romance of the fourteenth century. Furthermore there was a strong trading contact between Italy and Ireland from at 29 J.

But from the previous century another form of mobility had become very popular. Going on pilgrimage became one of the primary expressions of Christian living.38 Pilgrims made their way to shrines in search of spiritual and physical healing, in penance for their sinfulness and even in fulfilment of a direction in a departed one's will.3? Ph. de Felice suggests that a Frenchman by the name of Godalh was among the first pilgrims to visit Lough Derg in the year 1248.40 In 1353, seven years after the painting of the fresco in Todi, the Hungarian knight George Crissaphan, tiring of the crowds at the shrine of St James at Santiago de Compostela, decided to continue his penitential pilgrimage to St Patrick's purgatory. In the account of his pilgrimage it is described as being situated "in finibus mundi" and "inter homines minus domitos".41 Three years earlier in February 1350 Richard Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, publicised Lough Derg in a sermon delivered before Pope Clement VI at Avignon.42 Small wonder then that the master of this fresco associated purgatory with St Patrick. Lough Derg, free from the infernal associations of Etna and other purgatorial locations, had begun to flourish as the entrance to purgatory.43 The fresco reveals a mastery of composition and a skill in painting which is advanced for the mid-fourteenth century. The arched bordering, a throw-back to the international gothic, helps to unify the scenes depicted below. The treatment of the angels' wings in the upper zones of the heavens blends with the curvature of the arch, thus conjoining the mountain of purgatory on the right with the celestial city on the left. The walls of the city and their crenellations manifest a significant skill in perspective and give depth to this area of the fresco. The outstretched hands and the gaze of the two figures in the quadrants above the bordering also serve to focus the observer's eye on the dramatis personae. Their scrolls enunciate the themes of consolation and the promise of eternal life to the blessed. One can only admire the way in which the artist has accomplished such a unified treatment of his subject. There is a 37 T.J.

The line of the Madonna's figure and her slightly leftward position enhance the unifying movement of the fresco. There is certainly a sense in which its symmetry is attained through a finely measured asymmetry. One notes the earthen colours instantly. The pale clay colour and the greens of the terra verde predominate. They are enlivened by the ochres and by the ferrous colour o\' the patrician's cloak. Chiaroscuro was accomplished in fresco painting by using terra verde and terra nera, as may be seen here too. Here in the context of this fresco the symbolic value of the terra verde greens is not to be missed. For green is the colour of hope. Hope, says Dante, has green for its colour.44 Indeed Dante regards hope as the essential characteristic of his Purgatorio. White and green, the colours of purity and hope, symbolise the joyful expectation and hope of those in purgatory.45 The torments of purgatory, access to the celestial city and the mediatorial functions of the Madonna, St Philip Benizi, St Peter and St Patrick constitute the thematic of the fresco. Its mood moves from the imposing presence of St Patrick through the terrors of the purgatorial pits to the gentler tones of the encounter with the Blessed and entry into the eternal city. St Patrick is presented both as bishop and saint. Here the nimbus is bereft o\' any traces of gold in its punch-marks. His mitre, the mitra bassa, is typical of the Middle Ages. The orphreys of his garments - the cuffs, the collar and the tau-cross - are particularly striking. In his outstretched right hand he holds a rod - the Bachall losa, perhaps - which he immerses in the flames emerging from the mouth of purgatory. The mouth of the underworld and purgatory had long been associated with volcanoes. Indeed the dark flames rising from the mouth of purgatory in the fresco recalls the graphic description in an eighth century text of the black flames and sparks emitted from Theodoric's hell in the Lipari islands.46 Most likely the artist conceived of St Patrick as supplying the fruits of the Church's prayers for the dead to the suffering souls in purgatory, for the cult of the souls in purgatory began to spread in the fourteenth century.47 It is equally possible, of course, that the artist is alluding to the legend of St Patrick granting a vision of purgatory to the incredulous. The subscript to the figure below St Patrick's outstretched arm is almost indecipherable. Those with whom I have spoken in Todi favour the reading, Dominus Nicolaus. It is difficult to accept this reading. The figure is probably that of the patrician who paid for the work. Appearing in prayerful posture, after the fashion of including the patron in medieval works of art, it may have been the intention of the artist to represent him as privy to the vision of purgatory below and as beneficiary of the spiritual benefits the medieval mind associated with such visions. 44 Purgatorio III, 22, "... la speranza ha fior del verde." 45 Purgatorio, II, 16-24; III, 22, VIII, 28-30, VIII, 106-109. 46 J.

He is wearing a distinctive cap with ermine trim and tassel. His dark red cloak and its ermine collar contrast with the clay brown of the mountain ravine to the rear, with the ochrous colour of St Patrick's garments and the lighter pales and greens in the foreground. Thus a sense of depth and space is given to this area of the fresco. The mountain and the cavern are symbols of centres of spiritual rebirth.48 The mountain is the masculine principle; the cavern within the mountain is the feminine principle.49 In his study J. Le Goff claims that the mountain is an essential element in the conceptualisation of purgatory as it emerged in the course of the centuries.50 Jascopo di Mino del Pellicciaio, like Dante, also chose the mountain from the vast body of imagery available to him from the legends and visions to give a visual location to purgatory. While the motif of ascent may not be as clear here, nonetheless the heavenly city and its glory is to be reached and ascended to through purgatory. Interestingly Jacopo has also chosen to anchor his treatment of the torments to the theological framework of the seven deadly sins, as established by Gregory the Great in the seventh century.51 In the top left cavern, bearing the subscript avaritia (avarice), one sees a body lying in the foreground. The vaguest traces of flames are noticeable in the lower left corner. The scene is dominated by the figures of two demons. The demon on the left, whose ears appear to emit flames, has three horns and he is using a long bar as an instrument of torture. The artist's treatment of these figures is characteristic of the Middle Ages: the preference is for a naked anthropomorphic form with some animal attributes, dark or black skin, hints of matted hair, as in the demon on the left, and wings as with the one on the right.52 Although it is impossible to see the prostrate anima clearly, one is reminded of Dante's depiction of the miser cleaving to the dust of purgatory.53 Passing to the cavern directly underneath the figure of the patrician, subtitled lusuria (lust), we note several naked bodies lying prostrate in the flames. Often associated with rites of passage, fire is a constant element in the medieval conceptions of purgatory whether theological or otherwise. It symbolises a spiritual power of transformation and purification.54 Inspired by St Paul (I Cor.3.13) and by St Augustine's precise definition of purgatorial fire, the scholastics of the thirteenth century concurred in their acceptance of fire as an element of purgatorial purification.55 48 J.C.

Here the artist confines his treatment to the genitalia of the figure in the foreground. In this cavern the animae are tormented by three demons. The leftmost is represented as clawing into the breast of a body. The central demon is depicted with a terrifying horned head, his hands raised aloft as if to attack the souls, while the rightmost demon is using a trident to torture the limbs. The latter instrument recalls the use of tongs as an instrument of torture in the Vision of Dry the Im recounted in Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum.56 The cavern on the top right presents a group of animae who are being purged of the sin of pride (sup[er]bia). The artist has given powerful expression to their huddling together in the midst of the flames, caught as they are between ferocious fire-breathing monsters on the one side and two demons on the other. Due to a loss of plaster only the limbs of the demons are visible. As I have explained, the lower right area suffered some form of fire damage. There is also a se/ere loss of plaster here. However one can still see the first two letters, GU .. of Gula, gluttony. In the remaining sinopia outline of the cavern one can see the three faces of what were bodies lying in flames. In the cavern marked invidia (envy) we see the faces of at least three animae in what would seem to be a fiery cauldron. One face is certainly that of a woman. To the rear a winged demon with elongated limbs tears at the heads of the animae with his talons. Unfortunately damage has left the demon headless and prevents any further knowledge of the area behind the cauldron. Moving leftwards to the next cavern one sees a group of figures standing in the midst of flames. They are being purged of the sin of ira (anger). The detail of the plaited hair on the central figure is clearly visible, as are the demon's claws. Surface damage renders it impossible to see the figure of the demon. The bridge theme was prominent in the medieval conceptions of the underworld. Featuring in Persian theogony, it made its way via the Koran into medieval legends and traditions.57 The popular theory was that in the underworld the soul must pass over a bridge where a conflict takes place between the devil on the one side and good angels on the other for the possession of each soul. The seventh cavern is subtitled accidia (sloth). Here we see the figure of an anima making its way across a plank-like bridge bristling with nails. He is followed by a demon. Another anima is falling into the fiery abyss below and is attacked by a snake, also a common element in the imagery of the underworld. In painting this cavern the artist has drawn upon the imagery of medieval visions of the afterlife. In the vision of an English monk recorded by St Boniface in the early eighth century there is an account of a narrow bridge over which the souls of the dead had to pass. The monk saw one fall into the river of Tartarus below, while others crossed safely to the other side and thence into the heavenly Jerusalem. In the De raptu 56 Bk. V, eh. 12. cited in J. Le Goff, La Naissance du Purgatoire. 57 O. Delepierre, UEnfer, Paris, 1876, p. 42.; see also G.A.

The Madonna, like Blessed Philip Benizi and St Peter, is looking directly at them. She places a garland of white flowers on the head of the anima kneeling before her. In this detail the artist may have been inspired by the biblical text: "keep faithful until death and I will give you the crown of life" (Rev. 2.10). The animae are draped in white garments ? another use of apocalyptic imagery (Rev. 7.14). The male is wearing a shorter garment with a lower girdle, the female wears it to the feet and has a higher waistline. The coronation of the animae may be an allusion to the phrase attributed to Benizi "quicumque hie fuerit verus servus Christi fidelis, diligetur a Deo et coronabitur in celis,"60 and perhaps to his last words which I have referred to above. The majestic figure of the Madonna is the highpoint of the fresco. It is an exquisite composition. One notes in particular the soft lines of her facial features, the delicate treatment of the veil and the free flow of its hem. Her mantle, with its spots of terra verde and the beautifully flowing folds, was obviously painted with great care. Her neckband, similar in decoration to her cuffs, is characteristic of the orphreys of the era. No traces of colour were found in her aureole. Around it there are twelve stars which were painted in blue.61 This too is apocalyptic imagery. One recalls the description of the woman in the Apocalypse of St John: "adorned with the sun, standing on the moon and with the twelve stars on her head for a crown" (Rev. 12.1). E. Casalini's observations on the possible theological and devotional context of the fresco have already been mentioned. Whatever one concludes about his suggestions, it should be remembered that medieval piety focused on Mary both in its fear of and hope for the next life.62 Here the artist is acknowledging her intermediary role in the economy of salvation: she it is who welcomes the animae to the heavenly city. Her figure fits perfectly into the overall composition. Much taller than the animae to emphasise her heavenly existence, she at once provides a centre to the fresco and links the purgatorial spaces to the celestial city and the angelic figures in the heavens. St Philip Benizi was greatly venerated in the Todi area soon after his death on 22 August 1285. Miracles worked through his intercession were recorded by local notaries. The Servites looked upon him as a model both for his teaching and for his 58 ibi erat tabula longissima in modum pontis ... tabula ilia plena clovis ferr?is acutissimis. 59 J-M.

He is already referred to as sancto by the Servite Father General, Lotaringo, in his diary for 1285.63 So revered was Benizi's memory that the Servites of the French and German provinces soon began to refer to him, albeit vicariously, as the founder of the Order. Indeed fifteenth century official documents are equally vicarious in describing him as their first Father General. It seems reasonable to assume that the cult of Benizi, who was buried in this choir chapel, provided the context for the commission of the fresco. The frontal presentation of his figure underlines the devotional intent. Clearly it was this devotion which dictated that his bust be left visible when the remainder of the fresco was covered over.64 He is depicted in a dark-green garment, clean-shaven, with the rays of the blessed for a nimbus and an olive branch in his left hand. He passes the animae from the Madonna to St Peter. In this connection D-M. Montagna describes his role as that of a psychagogue65; he is a link in the chain of grace and intercession for humanity on its pilgrimage to eternity. One might have expected that Benizi would have been depicted with the lily, the classic attribute of the Servites.66 Although it may be a reference to his role as peacemaker in the city,67 the interpretation of the olive branch as a symbol of victory fits the context better.68 The souls have just been victorious in their trials, as Benizi had been according to his own last words. St Philip passes the animae to St Peter who is depicted in his role of custodian of the entrance to the eternal city. His is a strong figure, draped in two garments, the outer one of a rich earthen colour. No traces of colour were found in the nimbus. On his forearm he carries the traditional keys. For the medieval viewer the Petrine keys had a powerfully symbolic value, referring simultaneously to his power to bind and loose and to his custody of the gates of heaven. Peter passes the animae into the portal of the celestial city where they are received by an angel. The loss of plaster in this area leaves only the upper section of the city gate visible. As in Dante's Purgatorio, the mountain of purgatory is directly opposite Jerusalem, the heavenly city.69 One notes the star on the wall above the gateway. In Christian terms it is a symbol of divine guidance and favour. The allusion is to the star of Jacob in the prophecy of Balaam (Numbers, 24.17) and to the star of Jesus followed by the Magi (Matt.2.2). In the Middle Ages the heavenly city, the celestial Jerusalem, 63 A.M. Serra, art. cit. col. 749. 64 There is an interesting reference to the veneration of the Benizi image in the Tractatus de coenohiis, which A. Giani inserted in the first volume of the Annales O.S.M. (Florence, 1618), f. 160. It reads: in interiori sacrario eiusdem ecclesiae sancti Marco, ubi nunc degunt sanctimoniales franciscani Ordinis, vera b. Philippi imago in pariete depicta a suae depositionis tempore summa veneratione colitur an ipsis virginibus, quae admirabiles gratias nostris etiam temporibus retulisse feruntur. See D-M.

The latter often took the form of going on pilgrimage, as we have already seen. Going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem thus acquired an allegorical dimension in that it was seen as a pilgrimge to the true and celestial city, the goal of the Christian life.73 This is the symbolic function of the city which is so competently drawn in the fresco. Above the crenellations of the city walls one notes the figure of Christ with his right hand raised in blessing. He is encircled by eleven angels. The line of their garments, their wings and their gazes draw the viewer's eye to rest on the figure of Christ. This group composition is worthy of attention: note the treatment of the faces which are visible, the detail of the hair in some cases and the delicate execution of the folds of Christ's garment which gives depth, centrality and movement to the composition of the scene. The stylised arch is particularly striking both at the inner level of the fresco itself and at the outer level of the two quadrants in the upper corners. In the outer band the imagery is that of the vine. Close observation reveals the presence of at least two doves in the midst of the vine leaves. While the dove is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, it is also the symbol of a purified soul in the state of celestial joy.74 The early Christian graffiti on the tomb slabs of the catacombs show several examples of the Christian soul depicted as a dove drinking from the chalice of the Eucharist or pecking at the grapes of the vine.75 Doves within the vine foliage, which is what we see here, represent the faithful seeking refuge in Christ.76 The aptness of the symbolism in the context of the fresco is clear. In the quadrant on the right we see the bearded figure of Isaiah. One notes that his nimbus is further circumscribed with a polygonal outline. He holds a scroll in his left hand. It bears the words: consolamini, consolamini popule meus, dicit Dominus Deus vester, (comfort, comfort my people, says the Lord your God, Isa. 40.1). In the opposite quadrant there is a figure of a younger man, probably Matthew. He is depicted with a scroll in his left hand. Its text reads: Venite benedicti Patris mei 70 F. Watz, Onom?stica Sacra, Texte und Untersuchungen, 41, Leipzig. 1915, pp 105, 238, 255ff. 71 H. de Lubac, Ex?g?se m?di?vale, vol. 2, Paris 1961, pp 645ff. John Cassian (c.360-430) in his work on the monastic life, Conlationes, (Sources Chr?tiennes, 54) took Jerusalem as an example of the four senses of Scripture, (XIV,8). As de Lubac points out, this choice had an enormous influence on subsequent thought and spirituality. See also, B. Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, Oxford 1952. 72 A.

Matt.2.2). This text is often associated with scenes of the Last Judgement and it is alluded to by Dante after the last fire in his Purgatorio.77 The quadrants help to frame the fresco and the scrolls enunciate the consolation and the promise of eternal life offered to the repentant. Given the widespread knowledge of Lough Derg as a place of pilgrimage in the Europe of the mid-fourteenth century,78 it is not in the least way surprising to find the Patrician allusion in a fresco which has purgatory for its subject. The artist may have known of St Patrick's Purgatory from a single source, or indeed from a combination of sources. The Tractatus of H. of Saltrey, the word of pilgrims passing through Umbr?a, contemporary preaching: any one of these may have inspired the allusion. What his actual source was, the nature and extent of his knowledge of Lough Derg must remain something of a mystery, unless further research into the Servite and Todi context of the fresco's genesis can uncover material pertinent to the commission and execution of the work. 77 Purgatorio, XXVII, 58. 78 For a concise and beautifully produced account of the history of Lough Derg, see L.J.
